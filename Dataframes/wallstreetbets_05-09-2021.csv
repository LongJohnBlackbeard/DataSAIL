2021-05-09 17:47:07,wallstreetbets,Apparently you haven't heard: Earnings bad = stonk go down. Earnings good = stonk go down more.

2021-05-09 17:55:22,wallstreetbets,You belong here
2021-05-09 17:50:21,wallstreetbets,Sell and cut losses theta decay is going to ramp up and the likelihood of baba reaching 300 with all of the restrictions put on the company by China is very slim. You still have money its not too late to close position

2021-05-09 17:45:35,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
2021-05-09 18:00:09,wallstreetbets,I think Baba is a good investment going forward. I just hope it pays offer for you due to earnings. Earnings are so risky. Would consider a leap on baba if I had extra money. Good luck
2021-05-09 17:56:20,wallstreetbets,all in on options LMFAO
2021-05-09 17:50:56,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm gonna comment because I wanna be see the outcome. This has got to be entertaining either way

2021-05-09 18:03:25,wallstreetbets,"Ouch man, you are hoping on a 7% move after earnings just to break even, which is pretty much what the market makers have it at. Of course, implied actual volatility usually surpasses volatility so IV crush will happen. For the stock to reach $300 it needs to increase by almost 33% by next Friday. Good luck to you sir."
2021-05-09 17:44:42,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-09 17:46:38,wallstreetbets,"Silly, hopefully it won't take you long to recover what you lose here"

2021-05-09 18:22:52,wallstreetbets,Lol. Kiss all that money good bye.
2021-05-09 18:26:45,wallstreetbets,Why tho? Earnings plays never go well. Best of luck to you tho OP
2021-05-09 18:33:52,wallstreetbets,Looks retard approved to me.
2021-05-09 18:40:34,wallstreetbets,"Never a good idea to all in on earning unless you are prepared to lose it all. Here are the following reasons.

1. ER burn - option prices will drop like no other.
2. A lot of the times after ER, even if the company beat earnings, their share prices will still drop. Due to profit taking for the ER run up.
3. I hope you do well, if not, just think of this as educational fee for the market."
2021-05-09 18:26:49,wallstreetbets,"JD goes up on earning, baba gets crushed every single quarter. Best of luck homie"
2021-05-09 19:21:45,wallstreetbets,Wish you luck because I never want to see a fellow ape lose his life savings buut fuck man the CCP has been fucking around with baba recently so I‚Äôm praying for you.
2021-05-09 19:32:05,wallstreetbets,I hope it works out for you.  You risked all your money into this?
2021-05-09 19:42:56,wallstreetbets,"Good luck, retard. My BABA play is 7x 9/17 270c. I don't like earnings this time, market is fucky."

2021-05-09 18:41:54,wallstreetbets,You may have to hold awhile but once the CCP takes it over they will let it run wild.
2021-05-09 19:15:06,wallstreetbets,Certainly a bold play to put it all on the line for a company that basically lives or dies based on Jack Ma proof of life photos.

2021-05-09 17:59:18,wallstreetbets,Sell and take the loss. Put that money into shares this time. There are a lot of beat up names with cheap share prices. You could easily make that loss up in 2-3 months and see a 10-20% gain on top.
2021-05-09 17:58:34,wallstreetbets,Good luck

2021-05-09 17:19:39,wallstreetbets,I look at it as WELL took over Canada and is now expanding rapidly into the US with the Circle Medical acquisition - the ceo also sold his last company to PayPal for $304M in 2017 and has had the 29th richest man in the world as a seed investor all the way through the most recent round priced above market so I don't think they are limited to Canada in anyway.  I think they are just smart businessmen that saw an opportunity in Canada which would set them up for success in all other markets. Just feels like a difference between hype (Clov) and solid business fundamentals with not much hype (Well). I also personally won't contribute any more money to the clintons lol

2021-05-09 16:48:18,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I agree that Karp has sold a lot.

But, a lot of your premise is based upon time of selling from IPO. For a more accurate comparison, you could look at age of the company. For example, Wikipedia says Amazon was founded in 1994, and went public in 1997 - that's three years. Your post states Bezos sold shares six years after it went public, so in total that's 9 years since he founded it. 

Palantir was founded in 2003 and went public in 2020, or 17 years. So he's had to wait a lot longer to sell. 

Not saying you are wrong, but I'd be interested in the results once company age is accounted for. For example, you could look at the proportion of shares Bezos sold up to 2011 - that's 17 years since he founded it."
2021-05-09 17:54:50,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre wrong about tax implications. However much you‚Äôre granted, when it vests such as RSU‚Äôs or options, you have to pay taxes on those even though you plan to keep those shares. I.e. magiKarp gets 100 shares granted and vests on May 1st, and at that current time $20 is the stock price and his effective tax rate is 40%. That means he has to ‚Äúsell to cover‚Äù 40 shares ($800) in order to keep 60 shares ($1200). You can‚Äôt forego these taxes as it is considered income like a paycheck where you get taxed when paid out or when it vests. This happens EVERYTIME his SBC gets vested and after 17 years, it probably needs to be spread out over a long period of time; monthly or quarterly based on how much equity he has. 

Alongside this, the majority of salaries for the employees are heavily reliant on stock based compensation (SBC‚Äôs). Palantir underpays their engineers and developers In terms of cash but offers significant SBC. In order for the employees to get these, because of DPO, either Karp, Cohen, or thiel has to sell their shares to distribute to the employees. Karp has laid all these out and also on the S-1 filings. He‚Äôs been transparent from the beginning and gave insight on how they ran the company. People are just spreading FUD and fail to understand on how all this works."

2021-05-09 17:41:25,wallstreetbets,"Okay, if you want to compare that way let's see-

**Microsoft:** founded in 1975 and CEO sold his 1st share in 2003. After 28 years

**Tesla:** founded in 2003 and CEO sold his 1st share in 2010. After 07 years but he bought back all shares within one year. He sold some in 2016 but his net purchase is more than he sold. Basically he sold nothing.

**Amazon:** Founded in 1994 and CEO sold his 1st share in 2003. Keep in mind when Bezos sold his 1st share in 2003, Amazon was already profitable by that time and this is very important.

**Apple:** Founded in 1976. Steve Jobs resigned in 1985 and only then he sold his AAPL stocks. When he came back later and granted stocks/options in 2001, he did not sell a single stock ever. He died but did not sell those stocks.

**Spotify:** Founded in 2006. Neither CEO nor any other insiders sold a single share till today in 15 years.

**Slack Technologies:** Founded in 2009. CEO  First sold 125K shares on 06/08/2020 at $30-$32 after 11 years.

**Roblox Corporation:** Founded in 2004.  CEO David Baszucki sold only 1.3M shares at 67.77 in 2021 after 17 years.

**Coinbase:** Founded in 2012. CEO has not sold a single share till today in 9 years.

These DPO companies are more relevant comparison and you can see how the insiders acted compare to Alex Karp."
2021-05-09 18:17:01,wallstreetbets,">However much you‚Äôre granted, when it vests such as RSU‚Äôs or options, you have to pay taxes on those even though you plan to keep those shares.

Please show me the tax codes where it says that that you have to pay tax on options that are just vested but hasn't been even exercised yet.

If I am wrong I will correct the post, will be grateful to you for correcting my misconception.

You do not pay tax on options granted as part of your compensation at income rate. You pay at capital gain rate depending on how long you keep them.

>In order for the employees to get these, because of DPO, either Karp, Cohen, or thiel has to sell their shares to distribute to the employees

They do not need to sell share to distribute to the employees. That's absurd! So, you are saying Karp and Thiel are selling their stocks to their employees or are you saying that they are selling the stocks in market and then the employees are buying them from market. How selling them has anything to do with stock distribution to employees?"
2021-05-09 17:54:44,wallstreetbets,"Sorry for the unwanted omission. I used [https://www.secform4.com/](https://www.secform4.com/) for all of my data and they must have not been updated those transections correctly.

You can ignore all the transections happened on April 14 and April 15 as the company went public on April 14 and since it was DPO they needed to sell shares on that days. I did not include any shares sold by Alex and Thiel on the day of offering.

In my original post I was mainly referring the selling by CEO and when I saw no transections at all for $WORK, $COIN and $SPOT in that website I just added the word ""insider"". I will correct that. But CEO **Brian Armstrong** did not sell any shares till today.

Thanks for the correct information."

2021-05-09 19:02:18,wallstreetbets,"So if we look at the DPO companies, Karp sold after 17 years which is equal longest with Roblox. Next longest is Spotify at 15 years. 

I can't see how this supports a bear thesis? If anything one could argue Spotify, Work and Coin all sold much earlier than Palantir based upon age of company?"

2021-05-09 18:37:27,wallstreetbets,"Check the responses below and how RSU‚Äôs and options are taxed. This is why you need professional CPA‚Äôs to do taxes if you have SBC, because if you get vested and plan to exercise and sell you get taxed twice. Once for the shares vested which is considered as income and then capital gains tax you pay after selling the rest of the shares after you sell to cover. Your vesting dollar amount is reported on your W-2. Capital gains on a 1099. 

As for the SBC‚Äôs, founders have to sell their shares to distribute to employees. This is because they DPO and not IPO. There are no underwriters to distribute the shares. Where do you think companies get shares to distribute for SBC‚Äôs out of thin air? All shares come from the board / founder holdings. In order to distribute them there is a process of selling and granting. You really need to learn how SBC‚Äôs work and this is what institutions bank on for people to paper hand. They know that the average retail trader doesn‚Äôt understand how SBC‚Äôs work or bother to read the SEC filings and spread FUD."

2021-05-09 19:03:59,wallstreetbets,"You pay the tax on the option when it vests. The taxable amount will be the market price minus pre determined cost price of the stock. Say Karp has the option price of $1 and 1000 shares on May 1st but PLTR stock is $20. His taxable amount, when vesting will be his effective tax rate (let‚Äôs say 40%) of his vested cost so he pays 40% of $1000 ($400). The difference between options and RSU‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt have the underlying stock for those options, you can pay cash upfront to get these assigned to you instead of selling to cover for those tax implications. So either he pays $400 to keep those options or he has to exercise all and sells 400 shares (assuming market rate of the stock is at $20 per share) because he needs to pay taxes. The issue about paying cash for the option is that you have a time frame to exercise these. You will never be able to get away from tax implications from Uncle Sam and with SBC, you will ALWAYS get taxed twice. Once as income from vesting schedule and the other as capital gains tax. Effective tax rate for his cost and capital gains on his exercised options."

There were 5 stocks that got beaten down to absolutely absurd levels last week and which defy all logic or reason:  $CLNE, $ETSY, $RKT, $PLTR, and $WKHS - in that order in terms of how fucking ridiculous it was.  I already have big positions in CLNE and WKHS.  $ETSY (which I was shorting but still shocked at how far it collapsed) I just don't have room for in my Becky portfolio now that Honest is out there, $RKT I'm not interested in joining Theta gang again.  That leaves $PLTR, which I suspect was a combination of market manipulation that happened to accidentally coincide  with Blackrock dumping a shit ton of shares onto the open market and create a storm.

&#x200B;

So, $PLTR it is.  I think it's only got 3 dollars or so to the upside, making it the least interesting trade of the 5, but profit is profit.  Guess it means I'll have to stop shit talking them for a week or 2 until they get back up to a fair valuation."

Inflation being the biggest point of concern, if the economic data is good then there will be a worry that the fed may taper bond purchasing sooner than expected. Bad for stonks.  
If economic data is bad then watch for the bond auction to be good, or better than expected, and to not expect fed to taper any earlier. Good for stonks.    
&nbsp;  
The caveat; If economic data is good and the bond auction is good... Might be bad for stonks but am not too sure how it will be perceived.

2021-05-09 19:33:22,wallstreetbets,"You have the right idea but the wrong angle. It's all about the bond yields in that regard. As inflation creeps higher, bond yields go higher to counter the inflation, which makes lending cost more, which those tech companies don't like. It makes bond prices go down which those debt ridden companies will like (small caps)."

2021-05-09 17:02:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes.
AZN and GSK are green. I sorted to the biggest losses so all the micro stuff isn't there.
I tend to sell covered calls aggressively, so stuff that goes up gets called away. These are the obes that went down that i am left bagholding. Unfortunately they went down a lot more than my premium so I am stuck."

2021-05-09 18:27:27,wallstreetbets,I feel ya bro. I bought 27k on call options on Tesla thinking it was going to pop to $800. Instead it declined 4% the next day wiping out 80% of the option value. Lost over 10k in a day and watched it go down like a sinking ship. Learned an invaluable lesson - have a stop loss and respect it!!
2021-05-09 18:56:50,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the Apeville... what was your biggest loss in?

But yeah still in the game and steady recovery so not bad. Definitely missed on big gains because was not as sure in my gut as was before this (eg not buying more than 2k worth of GME when it was 17 and change lol)"

Edit. And I felt fucking awful. Losing their combined 20k was more damaging to me then losing all my own shit. But I‚Äôm fortunate and they forgave me and I‚Äôve given them safer tips since and have gotten sibling back 3k of the loss :|"

2021-05-09 18:38:28,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Had heard that before. Was trying to take a few years off from work and travel tho so was swinging for the fences and too stubborn to cut my losses back then. This was the lesson that stuck lmao

2021-05-09 15:09:03,wallstreetbets,Yes I'm definitely bullish in energy and also in metals. I'm keeping an eye on supply chains. That is the biggest disruption I see for most industries right now.

2021-05-09 14:45:21,wallstreetbets,"As a dad, I'm worried that you are scared to come clean. My kid will make mistakes, and will be in trouble, but if I allow my kid to be too scared to open up, I might risk him being compromised by someone that knows the secret. So it should always be safe to fez up and face the music. 2.5k might be your life savings, but you have so much more life left to lose more."
2021-05-09 14:43:12,wallstreetbets,Best way to handle this - own up to the losses. Explain what you learned and what your plan is going forward. Provide loss porn from WSB to create contrast and show him it could have been worse. Suck it up and move on. You‚Äôll be fine.

2021-05-09 15:16:38,wallstreetbets,"Honesty always works best. Guilt from lying will mess you up worse than his anger at what happened.  My daughter was always honest with me. I would get mad at first, but then realize she was honest and I worked with her. I bought her a car, she had a boyfriend talk her into taking a loan out on it in his name.  He took off with the car and she never saw it or him again.  $20k down the tubes. Every time I wanted to get furious about it, I remembered the fact she came to me and told me immediately."
2021-05-09 15:22:20,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, a 2.5k loss likely means you are a greater tax credit to your dad. Ofc knowing that you lost money will sting initially, but remind your dad that you are young, still trying to learn, and feel that stocks provide a great outlook on the future no matter what industry you get involved in after college. You sound like a smart kid that cares. Don‚Äôt lose that. Build yourself as a person and a trader. Keep a trading journal. Build a strategy that has been proven to work in the past, and learn to enhance the idea. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt give you advice outside of ‚Äúbe honest with your dad‚Äù but I really feel like that is the best way."

2021-05-09 14:48:56,wallstreetbets,"You could do them yourself but with so little time before the deadline it may be hard for you to do them properly and may end up owing more. It takes hours to file properly and certain loopholes have to be filed a certain way.

2021-05-09 15:10:41,wallstreetbets,"Own up man, your dad may get mad he may not. But he won't be as pissed if you tell him. You will live to see another day. If it was my son I would laugh and tell him that's life, Hope he learned a lesson and move on."

2021-05-09 15:45:30,wallstreetbets,"2.5k is not a large loss comparatively speaking. Send the forms to your dad and tell him it is the cost to learn options and you are learning from your mistakes and getting better. 
Going forward:  Suggest you trade 1 contract and take no more than .10 loss. Until you are getting 8/10 profitable trades stay at 1 contract. When 8/10 are profitable move to 2 contracts for a month; and on and on. Good luck."
2021-05-09 15:40:37,wallstreetbets,"Tell him. Your dad will help you by stopping you from a bad behavior, while making some change money with the loss deduction."

2021-05-09 16:00:54,wallstreetbets,File your own taxes. Get your dad hit with a tax fraud case. Tell him to get fucked. He loses over 2.5k so you don‚Äôt have to worry him getting mad over your losses.

2021-05-09 15:49:38,wallstreetbets,"You should just tell him, but you could just file by yourself via TurboTax; it‚Äôs really straight forward as you probably have only a W2 and the 1099 to file

2021-05-09 16:04:55,wallstreetbets,"2500 is like 250 was back in the day... there are kids out there doing way worse shit. don't file your losses then, nothing wrong with that either other than maybe you should disclose your loss and let your dad have the deduction. i am not a smart person fyi."
2021-05-09 16:26:12,wallstreetbets,"You only get taxed on income, losses don't need to be declared. If however, you are trying to use them as declared losses in order to reduce your (or your Dad's) taxable income then you will have to come clean and let him know, Depending on household income and his tax rate, it will save him roughly $300-700 in taxes. FYI, You can declare up to $3,000 a year in losses over 5 years for a total of $15K.

If the money you used was your own income, and you are over age 18, then the losses can offset all of your income on his married /head of household return. If under 18, and no income, I don't think it will be useful. That being said, **if you have gains in the next few years, you can use this loss to offset those gains.** You may want to talk to a different accountant about whether your Dad would need to file an amended return. for this amount, it may not be worth the hassle.

As stated by a number of other people, a $2500 loss is a very cheap education. Now you will be better at picking stocks with less emotion.

2021-05-09 16:56:04,wallstreetbets,So many useless answers here. You can file your own taxes as a dependent that way your dad won't need your 1099 whenever he's filing for you.
2021-05-09 17:18:00,wallstreetbets,Just take it to a tax person and pay $50 or whatever they charge
2021-05-09 18:12:10,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôll never be in trouble for overpaying taxes, which is what the result will be here. Just don‚Äôt say anything..."
2021-05-09 18:53:33,wallstreetbets,"Your Dad can claim you on his tax return as a dependent if he's provided over 50% of your support.

You file your own return.  Possible, your Dad has done this for you in the past or there has been no need to file a return. No need to say anything to your father unless you decide you want to share the information with him.  

If you've earned under $12,400 you are not required to file Federal taxes, but may have to file state taxes.  Given you have a $2,500 loss, the whole amount can be deducted from your Federal income.  

This is no place to ask for tax advice.  A better place to post under is r/tax

Good luck."
2021-05-09 19:45:54,wallstreetbets,I would just runaway from home if I were you.
2021-05-09 14:44:40,wallstreetbets,"Maybe You could forgo the tax write offs for the losses and just not give him that specific 1099? I‚Äôm no expert, this is not financial advice"
2021-05-09 17:02:50,wallstreetbets,2.5k is nothing. Tell him it's the price or learning the trade
2021-05-09 17:55:31,wallstreetbets,SHIBA INU COIN! FO THE MOON!!!!
2021-05-09 15:05:57,wallstreetbets,"In all seriousness though, if he's claiming you as a dependent I don't think you even have to file taxes. If the 1099 is in your name and there wasn't any profit on it the govt won't care. I know when I was working and also a dependant as soon as I started filing my taxes and checked the box that said ""someone else can claim me"" it just said k thanks bye. And that was the end of it.
Granted I'm not a CPA or tax advisor and that was almost 2 decades ago so double check on that, you can prolly get free advice from someone who is though (I'm sure theres a subreddit for that).
That being said should seriously talk to your pops about investments a little. Can be interesting convos sometimes and helps build trust"
2021-05-09 14:56:25,wallstreetbets,"the dad cant claim the losses lmao. even if ur a dependent, you have to claim your own income as well as your losses"
2021-05-09 16:14:46,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve always admired my father for this. He makes me realize I fucked up but never holds it against me and always helps me fix it. Not handouts, but quality love and advice to prevent future mistakes."
2021-05-09 14:48:27,wallstreetbets,"not true, my dad still doesnt know i got multiple women pregnant in college and forced them to get abortions. he would likely disown me, some things better left unsaid."
2021-05-09 14:51:51,wallstreetbets,Nah. Delete the account and move to Puerto Rico. Establish residency and learn Spanish.
2021-05-09 14:51:08,wallstreetbets,Tangentially. Woah
2021-05-09 15:20:31,wallstreetbets,"thanks for the car, pops :)"
2021-05-09 18:37:44,wallstreetbets,great piece of advice

2021-05-09 17:38:08,wallstreetbets,"So all in all,  I had no income in 2020 so if I just dont file them then I dont get in trouble with the irs?"
2021-05-09 17:36:47,wallstreetbets,"What about if you had no income in 2020, i heard you dont have to file"
2021-05-09 15:28:53,wallstreetbets,"You are right about that. The dad can‚Äôt claim it. 
But from what I‚Äôm reading the father still needs to reports the sons form 1099 on form 8814 line 3, but it only says gains?
Didn‚Äôt think I would be looking looking up usa tax law from Australia this morning."
2021-05-09 14:50:18,wallstreetbets,That escalated quickly.
2021-05-09 17:33:22,wallstreetbets,"My buddy had the same problem, he got 3 girls pregnant over the course of 18 months @ his school. 2 of the girls had abortions, but the third made such a big fuss about it. She wound up getting her mother involved, then all hell broke loose. In the end her mother wound up signing the parental consent form, but the school still fired him. Be careful!"
2021-05-09 17:31:37,wallstreetbets,Consider more anal sex.
2021-05-09 16:08:12,wallstreetbets,Excellent work from a financial perspective
2021-05-09 14:52:45,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs really horrible
2021-05-09 17:32:30,wallstreetbets,"Its true, I am this guy's Dad, I hate my son already but now that I know this I hate him more."
2021-05-09 15:49:10,wallstreetbets,"Learn to use a condom or get a vasectomy. Do you know the lasting mental affect having an abortion has on a woman?  You go on trotting your junk with no respect for woman and it doesn‚Äôt affect you mentally or emotionally.
Future woman you date, tell them how many woman aborted your child and see if they go out with you again!!"
2021-05-09 16:06:23,wallstreetbets,yes but you have doubled down on being a shitty person. die with the lie. probably voted for bush. all im saying is i can see that point of view and certainly can understand it.

2021-05-09 15:59:25,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve had a couple of gin mules. Feeling confident!
2021-05-09 18:47:52,wallstreetbets,"Correct, IRS only cares if you made a profit on the investment. You don't have to report losses, since there is nothing to tax. Five years from now, you will remember you made a small loss in 2020, and apply it to the ginormous gains you made in 2025 :)

As a father, I would want to know if my son was losing money, more to try to work out what can be done better next time, than to beat him up about it. But you know your dad, so you are in the best position to anticipate his reaction.

Uh, I just want to ask the obvious, it was your money right? Not on margin or stolen from your mom's emergency fund? Just asking...

Also, please show the loss porn.

Apes Strong!"
2021-05-09 19:51:34,wallstreetbets,"You honestly don't have to file at all if you don't want to but you don't lose anything by filing. Just use turbo tax and file as a dependent and put in your 1099. Your dad won't ever know because when he goes to file for everyone, he'll file for you as he normally would and you don't have to provide your 1099 because you already filed."
2021-05-09 15:39:37,wallstreetbets,"8814 is just for large gains for dependents who are minors, and dont file there own taxes. if you are a dependent but still file your taxes because you have a small w-2 or 1099nec or something, you claim all of your dividend and interest income. form 8814 was only created to stop the wealthy from hiding assets under their childrens names and avoid paying taxes on them."
2021-05-09 15:42:21,wallstreetbets,also. TOP OF THE MORNIN TO YA MATE

2021-05-09 14:58:11,wallstreetbets,Lol I meant you are horrible. You convinced women to kill their children. As they get older and are more level headed they will feel awful about it and even think about how the child would have turned out. You robbed them of that. I mean I don‚Äôt actually care. Whores are retards so maybe the kids are better off dying?
2021-05-09 15:37:14,wallstreetbets,"I always get the 2 mixed up, which one has the Panama canal?"
2021-05-09 15:34:00,wallstreetbets,Oh... you'll do better next time I'm sure.
2021-05-09 15:37:39,wallstreetbets,">Whores are retards so maybe the kids are better off dying?

WTF!"
2021-05-09 15:10:51,wallstreetbets,"Every coin has 2 sides. 
Possibly on the other side of that coin those women will think back on the situation and be thankful they didn‚Äôt have a child at that early age. It allowed them to pursue careers without the obligation of raising a child. It allowed them the freedom to choose their own destiny, rather then being forced to have a child with someone who clearly is not ‚Äúfather‚Äù material. 

But what do I know..... I am retarded ape."

2021-05-09 15:05:02,wallstreetbets,"From what I've read about online advertising, it's not actually all that clear that targeted advertising even works. When it does work, it's often only marginally better than sending the ad to everyone. There's been a ton of studies on this over the years to back this up, targeted advertising is something that should make a huge difference in theory but in practice it almost always doesn't. The advertisers seem to believe it works however and might reduce their ad spend if they can't target their ads as much, which could be significant, but I don't think conversion rates are actually going to take anywhere near as much of a hit as people think they will.

Also bear in mind, this AFAIK is only on tracking cookies (might be wrong, EDIT: I'm wrong, see /r/doomslice comment), which is 1 of the primary sources of information they use to build a profile on you. Facebook can still build a decent profile with their other sources (FB/Insta/Sites with FB login activity), just not as well, as tracking cookies previously allowed them to see your activity on the rest of the internet.

Remember this doesn't just affect FB. This could actually strengthen FB's position relative to other platforms. Since advertising platforms can only now collect from within their walled garden of apps/sites, the platform with the biggest garden is now in a much better position relative to a lot of their smaller competitors.

I advertise on FB for a variety of clients, so that's my perspective and my bias here. The accounts that target broad audiences (like all men, or all women, or everyone age 25-45 etc) are doing better than before the iOS roll out. The accounts that are super specific (not real to protect my identity, but for instance: only people with a passion for llama farming, only business owners who are losing their hair or only foodies in the greater Austin area) are struggling. 

One other consideration is that FB can just charge more for their inventory (and they absolutely have been...CPM's are up for us roughly 30-50% vs pre-pandemic).

Lastly, I saw some comments mention cAPI, but that doesn't work for opted out iOS users...which again is a drag for smaller advertisers but doesn't matter for bigger advertisers."

Facebook optimizes ads using their ""pixel"". This is a bit of tracking code that any business advertising on Facebook (including Instagram and WhatsApp) will put on their website to give Facebook activity of what's happening there.

The default of opting out of tracking in iOS 14 breaks that link between Facebook and that pixel, so Facebook's ad delivery algorithm doesn't learn who's adding to cart, who's purchasing, etc.

Typically, they can see: ""this demographic of person, from this region, with these interests bought this product from this ad. Find more people like that to show this ad to."" The lack of tracking makes that much more difficult."

From quickly googling here's one that derives it's stats from a study https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/31/targeted-ads-offer-little-extra-value-for-online-publishers-study-suggests/ that also comments on your question on how they could be so big if their business model doesn't actually work that well in practice. You can probably find articles the other way too but those tend to be articles advertising for a platform with a strong bias.

It seems the benefit of targeting is a lot smaller than you'd expect and the advertising titans probably derive most of their value from coverage and the perception that their targeting works a lot better than it actually does. With the low % improvements and companies paying extra for targeting, it wouldn't surprise me that targeting ads ends up being a wash for most.

It could be argued that the minor improvement is due to most companies using shitty targeting and the few who target well get the expected improvement. These shitty companies aren't suddenly going to get less shitty after this change though, so their conversion rates probably won't drop much and cause them to leave/reduce spending.

You could also argue that even low single digit improvements in conversion rate is actually a bigger deal than I think it is and this minor hit could cause disproportionate reallocation of marketing spend to other forms of advertising. But I don't know enough about the industry to comment on that. I just think that the market is probably going to think this is a bigger deal than it actually is, and there may well be money to be made from that."

&#x200B;

$TSLA is currently the 6th biggest company on the exchange.  In order to achieve that status, you have to execute.

&#x200B;

If you came to me and said ""Rage, there's this company.  They make electric cars and, aside from federal subsidies, don't make any money doing so.  BUT...they've got this really interesting revenue channel installing solar powered roof tiles with lifetime guarantees (especially important for areas with significant hurricane/hail issues) and continuous power delivery systems for roughly the same cost of a normal shingled roof.  Also, they can build giant battery systems that work on the municipal level.  They've got interesting automated transport technology which is proprietary and light years ahead of anybody else, and they have unique passenger vehicle battery technology that is best in class.  These dudes execute really well, and they're the 6th biggest company on the market"".

I'd believe you re: their valuation.  And I'd be excited to invest.  I'd be super interested in that roofing technology and  how almost every home in the country would eventually want one, with fantastic margins.  I'd sell my shares in Generac immediately

&#x200B;

But if you came to me and said ""they insist they're a car company, they charge a fortune for their vehicles but owners of them say they feel cheap and plasticy compared to traditional auto maker products.  Their chief executive seems bored of that whole automotive business and is more focused on promoting joke digital currency and flying people to Mars.  Oh, and the federal tax credits they have been leaning on to get people to buy their cars are expiring right as every other significantly better established auto maker in the world is getting ready to roll out their competing products which will cost less at the sticker, be more refined in detail, AND will offer those tax credits this company can no longer advertise.  Really, they're a battery company.  They've got interesting solar roof technology, but they execute so poorly that people have been waiting over a year for their installation and the company is now facing class action lawsuits because they tried to breach the contract by raising the prices by over 30% after the contracts were signed.  They claim they can make municipal level battery systems that tie in with solar, but all they've got is a proof of concept in a remote part of Australia where it's sunny 340 days a year and has plenty of open space.  And the Texas winter storm proved how fickle solar technology can be, so their technology isn't nearly as useful as another company's solid oxide power generators which only need a source of hydrogen or natural gas.  They have some automated driving technology, but it's super janky and the company has continuously overpromised and under-delivered to every sucker who checked a box to give them $10,000 for glorified lane assist.  They have unique passenger vehicle battery technology that is best in class.  But this company is absolutely terrible at execution.  Oh, and the only reason their quarterly revenue results aren't abominably bad are because they managed to buy-high-sell-higher on the Devil's Gold and sold a bunch of carbon tax credits to other companies to pad their bottom line.  They're the 6th biggest company on the market"".

&#x200B;

I'd laugh at you if you suggested investing in this, and call anyone who did a moron.

&#x200B;

$TSLA is fine for a scalp or even a swing, but their inability to execute on vision, their CEO's apparent disinterest in the entire company, their upcoming headwinds from legacy competitors who are simply better at making cars, and complete failure in customer satisfaction and meeting expectations make this company barely investable.  But certainly not worthy of being the 6th biggest company out there.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer:  I own a significant amount of $TSLA stock, but I bought it back in 2010 for a cost basis (what is now, after the splits) of $4.09 a share (I think back then it was actually $25 or so).  I'd never buy shares today.  I've 3 Tesla roofs, which I love (2 of them in Colorado where hail absolutely destroys roofs even if they're concrete), but would never pay today's rates for.  And a Model S, which I can't wait to trade in for either a Lucid Air or an Audi EV because it's plastic garbage with a software package that actively tries to kill you."

If you truly believe Tesla is 10 years ahead of the competition and take that as fact to justify the current stock value, and a future value of $1.2 Trillion, you are in for a rude awakening.

EVERYTHING has to go perfectly for Tesla over the next ten years to justify today's stock price and projected future price. 

A huge assumption in the future price of Tesla stock is their success in volume production of the 4860 Battery. This is completely unproven technology.  No one has ever mass produced such a cell. Building a factory to produce this is far easier than actually developing the trade secrets and proprietary techniques to successfully produce these.  How much experience and expertise does Tesla have manufacturing batteries? ZERO Years. Zero experience. They are not 10 years ahead here.  If anything, they are several years behind the state of the art. 

Tesla is a great company, and they have lots of super talented employees, but in making predictions about future stock valuations it is a good idea to be aware of the risk factors.  This is something that few sky high predictors of stock price seem to want to consider in any way."

Market share in EU will go down as well, since Euro buyers prefer quality cars (remember, VW in US is not the same as in EU).   
Tesla factory in Berlin will be a fucking disaster, mark my words. It's already behind schedule and now there's even a probe into them shitting on DE labor law.  
Let's not even start about China, where the local competition is heating up as well (WSB favourite NIO) and will always get more govt fleet contracts, etc. Also, China loves luxury and they'll gobble up all EV Macans and German brands rather than Tesla.  

Anyway, I love Tesla since I make little money shorting it every day as it melts down to $650."

He isn't going to step down any time soon. If he dies, you have to realize that he isn't running the company alone. He has very competent people managing various aspects of the business. They also have their long-term plans laid out already.

You also shouldn't underestimate the corporate culture at Tesla, where people are trained and socialized into ""Elon's ways"" so to speak.

So even if he dies, the company should be fine in the near future. Longer-term they simply have to find a new CEO to pick up where Elon left off. I'm sure there are several candidates within the company."

That's 8-10 years ahead of the other guys.

If Google can be 10 years ahead of competition so can someone else. Tesla seems like a prime candidate for such a scenario.

This is incorrect. You are ignoring taxes and one-time expenses. They are, in fact, profitable without both.

And if you only look at the auto business, they actually had a $2 billion profit there **excluding** credit sales.

>Meanwhile, Stellantis is stopping purchasing Tesla carbon credits, which is 50% of Tesla credit revenue. All other manufacturers will slowly do the same, as they ramp up EV production.

Yeah, they are stopping some time in the distant future. Meanwhile, the likes of VW have to step up their credit purchases.

>The competition is heating up as well, if there was no semiconductor shortage, the new e-mustang would eat into Tesla sales much more than it did. Same with other manufacturers.

The Mach-E did not eat into Tesla sales. Didn't affect them at all. Tesla increased sales by more than 100% in Q1.

Even if it were true that it's behind schedule to any relevant degree and there is a probe into labor law, what difference does that make overall? The factory will still be finished, and will start producing vehicles. At this point it looks like you are just desperately trying to make up some randomt stuff to defend your position.

>Let's not even start about China, where the local competition is heating up as well (WSB favourite NIO) and will always get more govt fleet contracts, etc. Also, China loves luxury and they'll gobble up all EV Macans and German brands rather than Tesla.

>Anyway, I love Tesla since I make little money shorting it every day as it melts down to $650.

Although I will say that Tesla is at least 5 years ahead on an established charging network.

You have Tesla right now talking about producing vehicles out of Texas, in an assembly plant that‚Äôs going to be operating while it‚Äôs still in partial construction.

2021-05-09 15:36:40,wallstreetbets,"zzzzz the PE argument really? Go look at Amazon‚Äôs PE ratio that was 3x higher than Teslas ever was and that was 2012. Was Amazon a bad investment in 2012? PE is a useless metric for looking forward‚Äîits only useful for looking at the present and past.

Edit: corrected 2014 to 2012 (AMZN had PE over 3500 in 2012 and over 1000 in 2014). That is roughly 5x Tesla's current PE of ~700."
2021-05-09 13:39:02,wallstreetbets,Another point I dont hear discussed alot is tesla's innovation on the manufacturing side. Tesla developed an aluminum alloy to allow them to die cast larger parts than current die casting technology cant produce. They are replacing 70 parts of the model 3 with 1.

2021-05-09 15:48:33,wallstreetbets,"I hear PE ratio one more time in this sub ima start blocking people that use it. PE ratio is for looking backward or at the present not the future. 

Amazon had a much higher PE ratio in 2014 than Tesla ever has. People argued ‚ÄúAmazon would have to sell 150% of all the books on the planet to be worth their current value!‚Äù. Yea, thats if they weren‚Äôt making new products and taking over more market share. 

Of course their PE looks high right now because future growth is priced in. If Tesla had 0 growth priced in then yes $60 would be a reasonable share price. They‚Äôre working toward taking over more market share and more markets such as the energy sector. $60 would be a reasonable share price if they scrapped all innovation, stopped all factory construction, and just kept producing what they currently make and nothing else.

‚ÄúWell why isn‚Äôt Apple at 600 EPS?‚Äù Maybe because I use a handed down Iphone 6 and see no need to spend more than $200 on one of their products? Maybe because they have tiny innovations compared to literally launching people to the ISS and self driving? I don‚Äôt expect Apple to come out with ANYTHING that is too risky for investors. All the large apple investors, like Berkshire, do not want them undergoing risky innovation. They just want smaller, guaranteed profits and are happy with that. If you had $1 bil and you wanted some small but guaranteed returns who would you give it to? The guy blowing up rockets and trying new technology that nobody has ever gotten to work? Or the giant monopoly with slave-labor cheap products that everybody uses?

Big money isn‚Äôt even fully behind Tesla yet. Wait until they are."

Tesla like many companies are not fully honest:

They had to buy back every single TDI world-wide, including mine, set up a HUGE system, took a year and a half, for me it went down like one would hope a government could work; very fucking slick, requiring every horizontal and vertical sector of the company.   
I shoulda bought that dip but I wasn't set up, but that was my instinct.

Since you think waymo is ahead of tesla right now, you probably dont know what lidar is and its limitations - picture waymos cars kinda like trams, they cant leave the specific streets that they have extensively mapped and forced to use expensive sensors to navigate on. Teslas system in the current fsd beta you can start up from anywhere and drive to any place - this does not mean teslas right now drive way better than waymo can on their one street, but in scaleability and actual practical use for consumers tesla is years ahead due to waymos overreliance on their systems such as lidar and perhaps radar and others.

They're still losing market share there. How can you argue that losing market share isn't a bad thing? If Tesla cannot maintain market share in Europe, then it cannot sustain it's current share valuation. Germany is the 2nd largest EV market in the world behind China, and Tesla is losing there. VW has far more capacity. The fact that Tesla has get to even start production in Europe is part of my point.   


"" If you look at worlwide sales, Tesla is #1 by far.""  


I never disputed that, the majority of their serious competitors coming out of Europe are only just rolling out production in Europe. Soon they will be converting their ICE manufacturing into EV manufacturing, it's far easier to switch a factory to building something else than it is to build an entirely new factory.  


"" The problem again, is that you are cherry-picking Europe instead of looking at the total picture. ""  


Problem is, you're relying on a short term perspective. The European data is very worrying, it suggests that Tesla is hitting a production bottleneck and if they cannot deal with that issue then they will continue to lose market share against companies they do not have to build new capacity because they already have capacity to convert.  


"" They are planning to have to buy credits from Tesla in China... ""

Then after I bought it and watched a bunch of YouTube videos on it, YouTube started recommending TSLA videos and between my personal experience with the car and all the stock research I did on the company I started buying shares (which have no essentially made up the difference in price between the fiat and model 3), all in spite of Elon being a giant douche as far I knew at the time.

It doesn't benefit the countries industry and no one thinks the health standards are acceptable.

2021-05-09 15:58:46,wallstreetbets,">mods chilled on the scrubbing of memes and censoring particular stocks... 

>Mods have stood down

OP is acoustic (though a nice guy), we never banned GME, you can find GME posts every single day, quit buying dumb conspiracy theories from young accounts that tell you to destroy your own community.

**EDIT**: I keep a detailed DB of everything that happens on WSB. It makes sense given the magnitude of the userbase increase, but most of the accounts that are saying the word ""compromised"" joined on the same single day during the GME pop. Food for thought.

**EDIT 2**: [Here's an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8gvid/mods_have_stood_down_lets_relight_this_candle/gxl6c5a?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) of a guy who is convinced we're censoring GME but is actually just a shitposter."

Sry for hostility, the sentiment is the same towards people saying older music is the best and nothing new is worth listening to, just, maybe, try and get out of your comfort zone you'll start liking new things.

Edit : here's a crowd just as much into it as this show https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPtM9PByK_4"
2021-05-09 15:57:09,wallstreetbets,"Been going to live shows since mid 90s. 

It was never the cell phone ruining shit. It's smart phones and probably social media for ""live streaming from the event""."
2021-05-09 15:02:42,wallstreetbets,"Maybe since Covid but I‚Äôve been to some pretty massive shows like that. Wasnt Bieber and Tswift filling stadiums like that? Still huge shows for the kpop bands etc. I honestly think more and more people are just over the mainstream stuff. Its so stale and old. Not to mention its just another brand they are trying to brainwash you into consuming. 

My hope is that more and more people are abandoning idolatry of these Hollywood scams."

2021-05-09 16:56:19,wallstreetbets,I loved this subreddit prior to gme. At this point it's just trolls on both sides
2021-05-09 16:59:04,wallstreetbets,june2020? pre-COVID when the sub averaged 5k active users at at time was the real gem. GME put a stake in it. now it's just a shitty branch of r/all
2021-05-09 17:24:50,wallstreetbets,It honest to god makes me sad thinking about it.

2021-05-09 16:31:22,wallstreetbets,Yes this is the first post I've read in a while. Holy shit this place has gone downhill since the GME boom. And I am really not saying that because it's 'cool' to say.
2021-05-09 16:30:28,wallstreetbets,"You don't have any submission history here, did you delete them?"
2021-05-09 16:19:58,wallstreetbets,This came through

I literally filter out one or two of those a week at this point.

They're obviously trying to recapture the meme status GME had months back and its not going to happen."
2021-05-09 16:30:04,wallstreetbets,"Oh so this is a ban evasion? So you‚Äôre admitting to the fact that you were perma-banned for breaking one of the cardinal rules of the sub (no politics) and you then went around that ban so that you could post this comment, risking your entire device, IP Address, and all of your accounts being perma-banned from reddit.

And you‚Äôve admitted to it in a public comment?

Bold move, Cotton."
2021-05-09 16:30:23,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt using an alt to circumvent a subreddits ban also bannable tho‚Ä¶

Sounds an awful lot like you got banned for talking politics."
2021-05-09 16:20:14,wallstreetbets,kind of silly to expect this sub to dedicate a thread to one stock in perpetuity.
2021-05-09 17:19:42,wallstreetbets,Because the sub isn't about one stock. There are now other subs dedicated to GME. Feel free to go there if you need more conversation regarding Gamestop than already exists here.

2021-05-09 16:20:30,wallstreetbets,They did answer that question? You just didn‚Äôt like the answer.
2021-05-09 19:36:51,wallstreetbets,You literally have an entire sub for talking only about GME‚Äîyou all need to stop being obsessed with trying to force the cool kid's table to make room for you.
2021-05-09 17:29:41,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt that a penny stock now?

2021-05-09 14:51:34,wallstreetbets,They didn‚Äôt say older music was better you clown. They said all the people holding up their mobile phones at concerts aren‚Äôt living in the moment.
2021-05-09 14:42:01,wallstreetbets,"Idk man. The things are a bit different I'd imagine. Now we have cellphones in the way, when we didn't used to. Comparing old music to new is a completely different argument. You can like new music more than the older music before, but like the concerts less now than you did back then. You can also still enjoy the concerts today, but unless you are going to a tinier concert venue for like 1000 people max, I don't think you are going to be able to have almost everyone be in the moment. Phone's are too easy to have as a distraction, or for people to record while looking at their phone."
2021-05-09 14:46:22,wallstreetbets,Honestly the best show I‚Äôve been to in a long time was one where cell phones had to be locked in special pouches.
2021-05-09 14:38:55,wallstreetbets,"You mad, bro?"
2021-05-09 14:55:16,wallstreetbets,When was the last time you went to a concert? It's like 30% of people filming with their phones at any given point.
2021-05-09 16:15:34,wallstreetbets,Well yea that's what I mean. I mean smart phones when I say cell phone.
2021-05-09 15:19:18,wallstreetbets,"Nah there are still huge amazing concerts all the time. I'm talking about how there will most likely never be a really large crowd *completely on the same page* like that ever again because a large % of them will be distracted with their phones.

The phones are the most major part of what I'm saying but there's also the fact that Queen's 'We will rock you' and 'We are the champions' are two of the most oxytocin inducing ""fuck yes lets go"" songs you can ever be a part of in a crowd."
2021-05-09 14:09:09,wallstreetbets,mods chilled on the scrubbing of memes and censoring particular stocks...  They turned down the auto mods and have been cool with making this place fun again..  IMHO..
2021-05-09 18:37:20,wallstreetbets,I've been wondering because I haven't seen the GME daily discussion for a week or 2

GME -> Many new users -> New users often don't understand sub and/or rules -> Removed post

But the fact that even during the max filtering, there were *still* GME posts on the front page and in /new made it pretty obvious that it wasn't GME itself being filtered, otherwise the mods would have deleted those long before they reached front page or killed them all in /new.

There were also similar claims that the mods were secretly censoring a bunch of the other meme tickers this week, so if you were to take all the rumors at face value, then you'd have to think there wouldn't be anything left."

2021-05-09 16:37:01,wallstreetbets,"Honestly sometimes it gets a good post. It happens. It's a tradeoff of having to rescue a few good posts vs having to spam 100 bad ones an hour. They use an acronym that is some shitstock with a 2mm market cap or they mention one of the forbidden internet monies, maybe they activate some kinda weird rule accidentally.

The unfortunate truth is a lot of the people who joined who are into GME also don't know our rules. They make a GME-themed post and it runs afoul of one of the reasonable rules, it gets auto-removed, and in short order they're convinced we have *something against GME* because on average, it's true, a lot of GME posts get removed. The only new part is the proportion of people who don't know the rules and the fact that there's other communities and outside groups that have an incentive to try and pillory WSB.

We've always removed content for being duplicative, cringey, low effort, etc. Sometimes something that looks like good DD gets removed because we know it's essentially a copypasta or the 9,000th post about a triangle that has been forming for months, so has been posted for months."
2021-05-09 16:44:32,wallstreetbets,"It's ridiculously difficult to get a submission through -and not just because of the bots.

Literally even the drop in quality from December to February was fucking massive. Like the steepest drop I‚Äôve seen on the sub. And I‚Äôm not someone who‚Äôs been on it forever, sure, I‚Äôve only been browsing and lurking it for a little more than two years and became an active user much longer after that.

But just because things are always changing and getting worse in different ways doesn‚Äôt mean that the current drop in quality isn‚Äôt valid. Have you sorted by new in the past three months? Not only have the higher quality submissions and funny shitposts started to disappear, not only has the meme quality gone down, but even the comments in the new submissions are much, much worse."

If so, then Dave Lauer tried promoting his social media in his post, despite it being explicitly against the rules right in the sidebar. When the contents of the post minus the links to social media were reposted, the post wasn't removed.

Let's start off simple: proof?

The other sub took off because the mods didn't allow this sub to become GME Street Bets, and so concentrated GME discussion was directed elsewhere, including by the mods themselves. (Edit: And some people didn't like the WSB rules that have been in place for years, so they went elsewhere. And good on them for it.)

Legit DD was not removed (and kept removed, I'm sure some was initially removed by accident). Misleading bullshit and posts based on feelings and opinions were removed. Both of which can not be DD by it's definition. Again, proof?

And I've been on this sub for years, the sub is returning to the way it used to be, the way that made it so successful in the first place. That's not fishy that's fantastic. Your definition of ""fishy"" is just fucked."

2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UFC (biggest mixed-martial arts league) just went public, good short term and long term play? Endeavor group (EDR) just went public and options trading just become available.

It's pretty much UFC (it is the majority owner now and will own 100% of it via a buyout) plus a bunch of miscellaneous companies. Most of these miscellaneous companies are pretty worthless IMO, but I am buying it as a pure play on UFC.

Short-term catalysts: Hot IPO as MMA is really getting popular now, Elon as board-member. Good memestock potential.

Long-term outlook: Pricing is at a slight premium but given the trajectory of sports franchise valuation, it's pretty safe to say that at some point UFC will justify $20B+ even as a value play. Which means that even if it doesn't fly high right now, at some point it should go back up. There's little risk of being left holding a permanent bag.

2021-05-09 11:33:47,wallstreetbets,ufc purchased for 4 billion a few years ago. Worth 16billion now I think. and it‚Äôs only getting bigger.  Navigated the pandemic the best out of all other sports IMO.
2021-05-09 13:11:26,wallstreetbets,"With how badly the UFC treats there fighters I will never invest in the stock. I like MMA but if your giving up your life long-term ""head trauma""  you need to be compensated."
2021-05-09 14:59:42,wallstreetbets,"I think UFC fighters are fed up with low pay, there will be a mass exodus. Be careful."
2021-05-09 11:36:29,wallstreetbets,"Dana White is smart enough not to virtue signal himself, while allowing each fighter to say whatever they want personally! No kneeling during national anthem or flag burning or pig socks being worn. Plus it‚Äôs entertaining as hell to watch. I‚Äôm in!!"
2021-05-09 14:02:22,wallstreetbets,UFC is kinda meh. They wont even give fights to certain people like Ryan Hall because they know their fighters can't handle him. I would bet on Muay Thai kickboxing champion Lerdsila Chumpairtour over the number 1 in any UFC division from any time period. The guy will make Jon Jones' legitimate attempts to throw a spinning backfist look like an audition for an elementary school play.
2021-05-09 15:35:24,wallstreetbets,"UFC cutting lots of fighters , they must reduce their debt. Some guys are horrible and old and still collect their paychecks and shows up like 1 time a year."
2021-05-09 17:41:23,wallstreetbets,"I love the fighters but, I wouldn't give or risk a single fucking dollar betting on the people who run and operate that business. Shady evil fuckers. Buyer beware."
2021-05-09 12:40:23,wallstreetbets,It will be on my watch list for a good dip buy...earnings are May 11th
2021-05-09 16:34:24,wallstreetbets,"The UFC needs an American male champ in the heavier weighclasses. With Stipe loossing to Francis, there might be a bigger problem than you think. The US is by far the UFCs biggest market, and not having champ isn't Good for business. This why you get a WWE style BMF plastic belt."
2021-05-09 19:17:59,wallstreetbets,"As a fan of mma, i expect some fighter lawsuits about pay in the near future, could cause the stock to take a hit at the same time. For what its worth i am no expert"
2021-05-09 12:00:28,wallstreetbets,"this was my take too. huge ufc fan. wanted to like the stock.

but then i read about the group. that's not a ufc stock. that's a beverly hills talent/media agency.

>Endeavor represents artists in movies, television, music, theatre, digital media, and publishing.[3] It also represents the NFL and NHL.[4] Endeavor also leads a group which owns the Ultimate Fighting Championship[5] and owns Miss Universe"
2021-05-09 15:36:48,wallstreetbets,Thats $WWE
2021-05-09 18:11:47,wallstreetbets,But how do you know when it's towards the bottom of the dip and not halfway down?
2021-05-09 13:27:11,wallstreetbets,9-10 billions. But there is potential for improvement.
2021-05-09 19:53:32,wallstreetbets,word
2021-05-09 16:00:33,wallstreetbets,"Yea, it‚Äôs probably the easiest type of sport put together a new promotion. Fights are basically one offs. You only need 6 fighters to put on an event (3 fights). You get a venue for one night.

Team sports you need potentially hundreds of athletes, multiple venues multiple times, a schedule.  There is a really high bar for entry. It‚Äôs a huge front end investment.

Even Tennis and golf are based around large tournaments and a tour. The individual events compete for the athletes to come with prize money. Athletes also do exhibitions, but that isn‚Äôt where the huge viewership exists. Also they are different in that golfers/tennis players can play hundreds of rounds/matches in a year where fighters can only do a few fights a years, hence mix martial arts/boxing is a sports of one off events.

It‚Äôs highly likely someone(s) are going to make a run at UFC at some point."
2021-05-09 11:39:19,wallstreetbets,You sound like you get triggered when you are exposed to ideas you disagree with - seems you need a safe space snowflake so you dont melt when a person takes a knee
2021-05-09 15:55:35,wallstreetbets,"If he doesn‚Äôt allow certain things, then it sounds like he still virtue signals, just in the opposite direction"
2021-05-09 15:23:59,wallstreetbets,"Take my upvote as a fellow Ryan Hall fan , damn how I wish  I could fight like that."
2021-05-09 15:39:37,wallstreetbets,But  Ryan Hall does fight in the UFC though...
2021-05-09 16:25:47,wallstreetbets,This is why the UFC is spwewing videos on Youtube about fighters you should know. And there are alot of nobodies. The UFC has so many cards that it starts  to look like the regional circuit.
2021-05-09 19:57:04,wallstreetbets,Bring back Chael Sonnen!!
2021-05-09 19:00:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah the portion of UFC should and could just splinter off into it's own so EDR doesn't try to suck money out of it into it's other ventures
2021-05-09 15:54:23,wallstreetbets,"Usually, but you occasionally get some gold like the [Randleplex](https://ibb.co/VVq5P2Y) or the [Mouse Trap](https://ibb.co/DrddKdL)"
2021-05-09 16:49:17,wallstreetbets,"I find this hilarious that the OP you replied to literally said nothing about his own opinion of taking a knee or any of that bs. But then you you come and name call childish names and make assumptions about this person, while thinking you are above and ‚Äúnot a snowflake‚Äù.

Like man, you can‚Äôt make this stuff up LOL what is wrong with you people.

EDIT: Kind of regret replying now cause after scrolling a few comments of yours, I‚Äôm quite sure you have actual brain damage or a mental retardation. So I apologize."
2021-05-09 11:41:56,wallstreetbets,"I could say the same exact thing to you sir. If you‚Äôve ever run a business you‚Äôd know it‚Äôs not exactly a great idea to bring your personal beliefs to work with ya. Unless you want the business to fail, of course."
2021-05-09 16:05:45,wallstreetbets,"He absolute allows any fighter to say whatever they want, just like I said in the comment. HE himself doesn‚Äôt express his own views though, I personally think that‚Äôs  smart. Just my opinion and I‚Äôm sticking with it. I own a small business and choose not to plaster my place with Trump, Biden, BLM, KKK or NAMBLA signs, I just don‚Äôt want to alienate anyone from spending $$ in my place . That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying."
2021-05-09 18:14:24,wallstreetbets,When folks use the term ‚Äúvirtue signalling‚Äù its almost always a conservative who hates the fact that others make a social comment they disagree with.  Its not hard to see what he is trying to say there - for most of us anyway.  Thanks for playing though.
2021-05-09 11:46:37,wallstreetbets,"Well this is just bullshit, personal beliefs are what shapes a company? Chick-Fil-A, Marriot there‚Äôs plenty of corporations that their CEO‚Äôs or original owners implement religions beliefs or standards and are highly successful."
2021-05-09 12:30:49,wallstreetbets,did your stepdad tell you this?
2021-05-09 16:08:45,wallstreetbets,"He says his own beliefs all the time dude. He literally spoke at the RNC years ago. I‚Äôm a huge MMA fan and have a lot of respect for how much Dana helped progress the sport, but there‚Äôs no way you can act like he doesn‚Äôt spout his own political beliefs whenever an opportunity presents itself"
2021-05-09 19:06:12,wallstreetbets,"He used it to describe the frame of mind of another person though. Did you actually read the comment or did your blood just boil that he used that term? I‚Äôm leaning towards the latter because your reply indicates this.

And just because someone uses that term, you automatically assume they are a conservative hating on something? Hahaha Jesus man.

You look like the snowflake out of that exchange is all I‚Äôm saying."
2021-05-09 16:17:23,wallstreetbets,"Candace Owens just had him on her show 2 weeks ago for a 20 minute interview on how he‚Äôs keeping MMA out of politics. He said the fighters can do whatever they chose, he gives them complete autonomy to make their own decisions. He‚Äôs not going to move a scheduled MMA fight out of Georgia because they passed new voting laws, that‚Äôs how he keeps MMA Out of politics. He can speak @ RNC OR DNC, that has nothing to do with his business."
2021-05-09 17:53:31,wallstreetbets,"It does when he speaks AS the head of the UFC. He wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúrandom guy Dana White‚Äù, he was ‚ÄúPresident of the UFC, Dana White.‚Äù He has also espoused political beliefs during pressers countless times. You don‚Äôt like him because he keeps his beliefs out of his business, you like him because his beliefs align with yours"
2021-05-09 18:01:27,wallstreetbets,"I like him because he‚Äôs a smart businessman. He doesn‚Äôt instruct his players to wear George Floyd jerseys, or paint BLM‚Äôs logo on the mat, or move scheduled events because he doesn‚Äôt agree with newly passed laws. I‚Äôd feel exactly the same if he had players wear Kyle Rittenhouse shirts or had MAGA signs posted around the octagon. It‚Äôs just not good business to pick a side, you always alienate someone that could be a potential customer."
2021-05-09 18:55:31,wallstreetbets,"So you‚Äôre abandoning your original claim that he doesn‚Äôt push his own political narrative, correct? Just making sure we‚Äôre on the same page if we‚Äôre moving on to a new narrative"
2021-05-09 19:10:21,wallstreetbets,"I heard Dana White in an interview saying he supported the idea that Black Lives Matter, which is great and I fully agree with. Red Sox owner John Henry painted a 30 foot tall BLACK LIVES MATTER mural on the outside of Fenway Park, which is absolutely his right to do. Two people who both seem to have the same opinion, only one of them affected their business though."
2021-05-09 19:39:12,wallstreetbets,So it‚Äôs okay to say they matter but not to paint it? That‚Äôs a weird hill to die on. You also jumped around the question that was asked
2021-05-09 19:44:17,wallstreetbets,"I see a lotta folk in here claiming different levels of retardation, you definitely take the cake. My original point is not to mix business and politics. Dana White saying he supports BLM and John Henry putting it on the side of Fenway park are two completely different things. If you can‚Äôt see that there‚Äôs a huge difference, I don‚Äôt know what to tell ya bro. I‚Äôve yet to see a Black Lives Matter mural on either the mat or the octagon of any MMA event ever."
2021-05-09 19:49:33,wallstreetbets,"Ah, resorting to personal attacks because you can‚Äôt defend your position. Very classy. To remind you, you claimed Dana DOESN‚ÄôT express his own views. You didn‚Äôt say he does sometimes, you didn‚Äôt say he only does it in certain capacities, you said he flat out doesn‚Äôt do it. You then moved the goalposts when I pointed out you were wrong. Maybe you should look in the mirror before slinging insults about the intelligence of others"
2021-05-09 19:52:20,wallstreetbets,"Also, please explain why saying black lives matter is ok but painting it isn‚Äôt. Personally, I prefer my business to not have white supremacists in it. If I alienate them I‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôll make those sales up pretty easily"
2021-05-09 19:53:17,wallstreetbets,I said ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt virtue signal‚Äù and he allows his fighters to say whatever they want. Which is absolutely true.
2021-05-09 19:55:16,wallstreetbets,"He said he supports the idea that Black Lives Matter. Painting it on the side of Fenway is supporting the avowed Marxist organization Black Lives Matter which condones many radical and unsavory views. Not my opinion, go to their website and see for yourself."
2021-05-09 19:54:28,wallstreetbets,[Try again](https://ibb.co/6grdZCW). That‚Äôs not all you said
2021-05-09 19:58:45,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm the biggest Biden Harris supporter on earth. I attend all their rallies, I volunteer as a coyote on weekends to help migrants cross the border and my kids even wear the same diapers Joe does.

Institutional buys don't mean they think a stock is going up. They think a sector will go up, and weight shares across the sector.

Can see who they think will come out ahead though."
2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Next level DD: CLOV **\*TL;DR at the bottom**

So first let me get some things straight. I‚Äôm not saying this could become another GME, but if it reaches even 10% of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here.

&#x200B;

**Chamath** is one of the big investors in this stock. CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC‚ÄôS. I know lots of apes hate him, sure he should have diamond-handed GME. But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV? His track record is incredible nonetheless!

* A little more about the investment Chamath made! Short-term-wise, he can‚Äôt pull out his investment as he did with $SPCE because his lock-up expires in July 2021. I have to say that he wouldn‚Äôt jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn‚Äôt see the potentials.

&#x200B;

**Vivek Garipalli** is the co-founder and CEO of Clover Health.¬†Prior to founding CLOV, he founded CarePoint Health in 2008, a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey. He owns 83.5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which are looked until the price reached $30 for a period of 90 consecutive days. In his early days he worked as a Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse, he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners.

&#x200B;

**What is Clover Health?** Well, it‚Äôs an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers, but with a focus on the individual. In their own words: ‚ÄúClover‚Äôs Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground-up. Integrating our systems with doctors, clinicians, and nurse practitioners, Clover‚Äôs data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients‚Äô wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes.‚Äù

&#x200B;

* The development of this software is led by Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google, working with things such as Develop Platforms, Develop Ecosystems and AI/Machine Intelligence.

&#x200B;

* What‚Äôs the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare? Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision, dental, or hearing care. It can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital. Clover‚Äôs Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare, as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy ‚Äì all at a low cost and on an open network.

&#x200B;

* Besides being an insurance company, CLOV also seeks to develop the industry‚Äôs best, most well-informed, and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members. They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member‚Äôs care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys. Arming them with relevant patient information and data-driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover‚Äôs members.

&#x200B;

**Now to the fun part, the numbers!**

&#x200B;

**Public Float:** 109M; The biggest 3 combined owns 33M shares (Vanguard 26.1M, Black Rock ‚Äì 2M, Baillie Gifford & Co‚Äì 5M: They are either mutual fund & long-term, so it is highly unlikely they will sell in short term. This also makes it way harder for short sellers to fully cover their short positions as they would need a lot of shares which is locked up in these mutual funds.

**Revenue:** In 2020 they made $672.9m with a net loss of $92.7m and $462.3m in 2019 with a net loss of $181.5m. Revenue grew 46% from 2019 to 2020! Guidance for 2021 is $820-850m that‚Äôs a YoY growth of \~24.1%. They expect to be fully profitable in 2023, pretty impressive! Compared to the average 8-9% growth YoY in the medical insurance sector CLOV is doing way better!

**EBITDA** may not be sexy, but they can easily beat EPS for sure. They will flush $44.8M gain on derivatives in Q1 (officially published), which can shoot up net income. Also, they flushed all the unnecessary expenses/losses in Q4 (i.e. I-P-O-C and CLOV Merger legal costs, etc‚Ä¶. In Q1, 2020, they had a loss of 28M. So this one-time boost on derivatives in Q1 will beat the EPS estimate (at least for Q1). Also, they said they will increase their guidance - per the linked publication.

**Option Interest on Calls:** 601,034 (multiply by 100, which is 60M) - Gamma Squeeze. (Total) 350k of those expire in May. The options table looks ideal for a potential gamma squeeze, have a look in the picture below. As you can see there‚Äôs lots of open interest for almost every strike! Short sellers and the total call OI is around 107m shares if all calls become ITM. This would literally make it impossible for naked call sellers and short sellers to cover their position because of the low public float of 109m shares!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Short interest:** As of Friday the SI% of the float was 43.48% or 47m shares sold short. (source: S3 partners) This is quite a lot, actually the top 3 most shorted US stocks! The funny thing about this is that the price went up close to 5% even though shorties added another 2m shares to their short position. The SI% of float has gone up almost every day to keep the price down! However, HF‚Äôs are digging their own graves by doing that!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Total call OI and shorted shares** are almost the same as the entire public float. Keep in mind that out of the public float of 109m, around 33m of those is locked up within the top 3 biggest investors. Bringing the actual free float down to 76m shares. This would make it nearly impossible for the short sellers to cover the 47.7m shares they shorted.

**Short-Term Q1 Earning Call (Positive Catalyst - Facts)** \- 58,040 enrollment as of Dec 2020 increased to 66,395 enrollment as of April 2021 (they released earlier in April). So far, this increased 14% compared to the prior year (i.e. their revenue is also expected to increase by 14% from $166M in Dec to $189M in Mar 2021. Note that their annual guidance is 68K ‚Äì 70K, so we are already halfway there meeting the target, excluding the CMS contract in 10 states (that opens the door up to 200,000, which was already approved and started on April 1) There was an email from Andrew (IR guy), he said that he will release at the right time (Quiet period until ER, so I would assume this will be released on ER. If not, when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially.

&#x200B;

\- As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health's website! Definitely a sign of growth

\- Lowering the age of Medicare to 60 from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM. In money that equals around $250b more! This would definitely help CLOV expand further.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* In 2021, the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year, so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021. - April 1, 2021 ‚Äì Clover issued an 8-K statement to correct loss on derivative from $(51.1) million to $(6.3) million. This is a one-time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31, so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1. This is material because considering their budgeted M-C-R of 92.6%, Q1 profit is expected to be $13M (based on high-level calculations). This adjustment is 4 times that of profit/loss, so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021. (Note ‚Äì if you are a long-term investor, you shouldn‚Äôt care too much about this because this is just paper profit. But, because analysts‚Äô price target is based on the bottom line DCF, this will substantially boost their price target, further increase the price target). So, in Q1, Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss, which is impressive for a start-up.

&#x200B;

**So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50% down from Dec/Jan highs?** Well, there‚Äôs a couple of reason why.

&#x200B;

* Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS
* Manipulation from short sellers (Very high SI)
* Hindenburg short report, down below is a further explanation to this report.

&#x200B;

The short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year. There‚Äôs some more minor stuff besides this.

The DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out, they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER. The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company, and in my eyes, this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020, while generating 46% more revenue, impressive.

&#x200B;

**After the short report by Hindenburg short-sellers beat the crap out of CLOV**

&#x200B;

* CLOV responded to this in a long report, and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying:

&#x200B;

*‚ÄúThere is no more real person than I am about this shit,‚Äù he contended, casting himself as an honest broker in a ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù healthcare market during a meandering phone call. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt care, like, publish whatever. But don‚Äôt publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think.‚Äù*

&#x200B;

* This is a CEO that would do anything for his company, his shares are even locked up until the price reaches $30 for a period of 90 days!

**Next week,** when they release short interest info from NASDAQ (Tues AH), May MA enrollments and earnings (May 17, PM), and options expiry date on May 21‚Ä¶ can you feel something big and positive will come in the next few weeks? I sure as hell can!

&#x200B;

**Macro-wise,** NASDAQ had a little correction this week (today‚Äôs job report sort of kicked rotation from value to growth). Also, hopefully, after Elon‚Äôs SNL this weekend, that crypt-o capital will gradually flow into the stock market, especially already beat-up small/medium growth stocks with WSB ‚Äúshort & gamma squeeze‚Äù candidate).

&#x200B;

**Bearish case:**

* Increasing competition in the space
* Legacy companies VS CLOV
* From 46% YoY growth to \~24% guidance growth for 2021 (however this is really early still, we would need q1 to see updates on this, may surprise?)
* Potential Nasdaq correction

&#x200B;

**Bonus info:** Alphabet (Google) backed CLOV with a $500m investment. Walmart and CLOV recently made a partnership. Demetrios Kouzoukas joins BOD.

&#x200B;

**Analyst ratings:**

* Citigroup buy with a PT of $19
* Credit Suisse neutral with a PT of $10
* JP Morgan neutral with a PT of $15

So right now we are trading below all analyst ratings.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** CLOV is currently below its NAV and even further away from the average PT set by analysts.This is a company with huge success and a bright future ahead of it, in one of the hottest sectors under the Democrats! The potential downside is very low, as we are already near the bottom.

&#x200B;

**My price predictions**. If we get a little gamma squeeze I see this go to around $40-60 If we get a full-blown gamma squeeze combined with a short squeeze I could see this go to $75+ Without a gamma squeeze I see this at $15-30 before May 21st. **Please do your own DD before investing**, I‚Äôm not a financial adviser. And this is not financial advice.

For the apes out there üöÄüöÄüöÄ

I think you're right on many points, but the MA competition is gearing up with just as much effort. I'm holding north of 1.5k shares with an average of sub 9 for a long term hold because I believe this has great potential. Keep it up bro. Good luck to all."

One of these is the expansion to 10 new states. The DOJ case, which seems to be over? Positive guidance due to the Medicare being lowered from 65 to 60.

2021-05-09 15:31:15,wallstreetbets,"The Q4 earnings were prior to the spac merger which happened in Jan 2020. Part of me feels like chamath purposefully flushed all expenses that prior year.

The balance sheet is going to be drastically different, they also made some accounting errors in 2020 which they will correct this quarter, this is favourable.

Also before mid April clover wasn't listed on the CMS website as a direct contracting, now they are.

Revenue growth was pretty diasapointing but now they funds to go HAM. This earnings could be so so but April to June will be much better imo.

Regardless Q1 earnings should scream ""not a fraud, super undervalued"""

So then they can say that the assistant is improving healthcare costs and it's development and upkeep cost can be paid for with premiums. They can then get a larger effective margin on their premiums since a large part of company costs can be covered by premiums."

Yes you get government contracts but they are capped and its easy for your star rating to drop which lowers the amount they give you, your expenses are not capped.

At no points was chammath deceitful about what his intentions in tweeting & buying GME were during the squeeze in January.

2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Bill gates AMC and GME Bill gates got a divorce but why now? He knows what is about to happen to the stock market with amc n gme. He can‚Äôt sell all his stock cause that would be insider trading. So he gets a divorce so he‚Äôs forced to sell and splits it with his wife. Now he can‚Äôt get into trouble for insider trading and just saved himself billion of dollars. AMC n GME is going to crash the market and bill gates knows that. He is a smart man. This is just my theory of why he would get a divorce now and still continue to work with his wife

He would still happily having left 85% if he wants these 2 companies to go to zero."

2021-05-09 10:55:40,wallstreetbets,I read that he sold his shares but that‚Äôs why I started this discussion to see what everyone‚Äôs thought on it was
2021-05-09 11:23:54,wallstreetbets,How not they are going to continue to run the company together? U don‚Äôt think he will have to talk to her daily about numbers and projects?
2021-05-09 11:59:22,wallstreetbets,Stick around long enough.  There‚Äôs worse. LoL.

2021-05-09 11:42:47,wallstreetbets,Jeffery really kill himself that‚Äôs the real question
2021-05-09 11:06:22,wallstreetbets,Insider trading is only criminal without the right connections or alignment. No wonder OP is skeptical about a guy that enjoys the wildest benefits at the lowest cost of credentialism.
2021-05-09 11:21:35,wallstreetbets,"Um..... yeah, well I am in agreement with that but I just don‚Äôt agree with it for this particular scenario."
2021-05-09 11:21:44,wallstreetbets,This seems likely. Considering the Divorce rate this was pretty much inevitable.
2021-05-09 11:06:15,wallstreetbets,Just a opinion. You could be 100 percent right maybe they are just sick of each other. Not saying I‚Äôm right or wrong just bringing up the discussion to see what everyone thinks
2021-05-09 11:00:27,wallstreetbets,Stfu you ignorant little bitch. Who‚Äôs to say OP isn‚Äôt right and you are?
2021-05-09 10:45:43,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs true but who gets a divorce at that age? N why now all of a sudden and how many divorced ppl still work together. Also it usually takes a long time for a divorced to go through.
2021-05-09 11:10:20,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm saying on paper they are getting a divorce to save billions. Who wouldn‚Äôt do that? It‚Äôs just a paper saying they are together. They can still be together with a paper saying it. They just won‚Äôt have the label as wife n husband. They could also get remarried down the road
2021-05-09 11:25:55,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm saying on paper they might get a divorce but still be together. Your talking saving billions. In a few years they could get married again
2021-05-09 12:06:13,wallstreetbets,It is early in the week...
2021-05-09 11:07:54,wallstreetbets,Haha nope definitely think it‚Äôs round but the guy that predicted the 08 crash is predicting it to crash again. I just thought it was from hedge funds trying to screw ppl out of money to cover their shorts on gme n amc
2021-05-09 11:51:17,wallstreetbets,Who eats soup without an envelope? Next your going to tell me not to eat my cereal with a fork smh this guy

2021-05-09 11:19:37,wallstreetbets,Ppl think he‚Äôs so wealthy that he don‚Äôt care about loosing billions from the shorts. That‚Äôs a lot of money even to bill gates. Just to get a divorce which is what? A piece of paper. Bill gates ain‚Äôt trying to be the next Michael Jordan so he‚Äôs making power moves
2021-05-09 10:45:13,wallstreetbets,"No, Enron perpetrated a massive fraud."
2021-05-09 11:58:31,wallstreetbets,Lol why u think he‚Äôs the devil??
2021-05-09 12:52:12,wallstreetbets,Haha just a thought but he‚Äôs partnered with the hedge funds that shorted gme n amc. He‚Äôs standing to loose everything he built. I would be doing everything I could to hang on to what I can
2021-05-09 12:54:14,wallstreetbets,Only money he will have left is what his wife took if everything goes down how it‚Äôs suppose too
2021-05-09 12:49:08,wallstreetbets,He can‚Äôt buy it if no one is selling it
2021-05-09 12:50:01,wallstreetbets,If your theory was right why wouldn‚Äôt the hedge funds just buy amc n gme so they don‚Äôt go bankrupt
2021-05-09 12:48:33,wallstreetbets,Ya I heard he‚Äôs partnering with Elon musk n Mars has some beautiful aliens that Gates is interested in
2021-05-09 10:59:38,wallstreetbets,You are need to learn more about this üòÇ
2021-05-09 10:48:25,wallstreetbets,She received billions in stock. Not cash. Do you know how to read?
2021-05-09 11:06:55,wallstreetbets,"unlike jeff bezos, gates created microsoft 8 years before he met his wife, cca 10-11 years before they married. she is not entitled to much of his wealth as stocks he sold off went to the foundation. now we will see depending how much he gives her. I do not expect her to net more than 10 bil max, anything above that, its some kind of asset protection

even Bezos wife got just 25% and she could have taken 50%.

now if the stock market were to blow up, he just needs 2-3 bil cash and keeps rest of his stock of MS, as then he owns means of production. MS is nicely diversified to weather any kind of storm, bar Carrington event"

2021-05-09 11:49:22,wallstreetbets,Let's ask Bill.
2021-05-09 11:12:19,wallstreetbets,I just always question power couple moves. When they do thing they don‚Äôt think like normal ppl. They do thing cause it‚Äôs about money and finance. Regular ppl get divorced cause their not in love anymore. Rich ppl get divorced sometimes cause it benefits their finances
2021-05-09 11:02:15,wallstreetbets,We get it you want to kiss OP

2021-05-09 10:58:33,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, it seems very circumstantial.  
It's not definitive or anything, but certainly a thought one could speculate on."
2021-05-09 10:59:30,wallstreetbets,"Do you have any verifiable stats that he‚Äôs the first to get a divorce at 65... from data from us census bureau for every 1000 ppl aged 50 and older, 10 divorced... so that should answer your question on who gets divorced at that age"
2021-05-09 11:15:13,wallstreetbets,"I guess you aren't married. With children. Again, this theory is so out there I'd just wish the author was trolling. And then people defending it....just make me lose hope for humanity. No critical yhinking left at all. Clueless. Next someone will tell me they don't care because they are lizard people and he has his 5g chips in the vaccines anyway already"
2021-05-09 12:12:26,wallstreetbets,"If the market crashes it'll be from a year of lockdowns and trillions and trillions of quantitative easing, not because of a meme stock that cost the hedge funds a few billion dollars."

2021-05-09 13:41:15,wallstreetbets,Why would they? They are not BillGates. Do you think those HF have 130 billions of their own worth? And how do you know they won't if they have to? Pay 10m per share as oppose to crashing the company by buying it out now?
2021-05-09 11:03:50,wallstreetbets,So you don‚Äôt think when the hedge funds go bankrupt that the market will crash?

2021-05-09 11:15:12,wallstreetbets,Didn‚Äôt she already get almost 10 bil from his stocks? Not sure on the actual number but know it was in the billions and that was from stocks

Yes you are right marriage isn‚Äôt holy to most wealthy ppl. They just need to do research on the relationship bill gates has with the hedge funds and what he could possible loose.

Capital Gains tax can be something you are worried about. But you also have Capital Loss Dedications. If you are married and filing jointly or Single (like most retail investors are), you can claim 3k deduction. For married but filing separately folks, it's 1.5k. Best part about the system, losses carry over till the amount is fully used as a deduction (15k loss in a year translates to 5 years worth of 3k deductions). 

Example. If I lost 15k on my plays before the end of the taxable year (December 31st 2020) and I'm married filing jointly. I can get a 3k deduction from my taxable income or capital gains for my 2020 taxes. This then drops my capital loss down ammount to 12k. Next year for my 2021 taxes, I can use another 3k deduction from the 2020 losses to drop my taxable income. This again drops my capital loss from 2020 to 9k. You can continue to do this till that capital loss amount hits zero. 

Key point, no matter how much you gained in a year in trading, it doesn't just make your capital losses just disappear. Even if I gained in 2021, I can still use the 2020 capital losses to offset all taxable income sources. So make sure you claim those losses WSB. You didn't lose trading, you simply made it so your taxable income is offset in the years to follow.

Edit: Just to clarify. It has to a be a total lose at the end of the tax year. This means that after gains and losses. You have to lose money. This can only be calculated on closed out positions. Holding assets if they depreciate in value, doesn't mean it is considered a loss. ""It's only a loss if you sell"".

Edit 2: Someone brought up Gains. If I lost money one year but gained money the next. My 3k deduction gets applied to the Capital Gains tax first. If I lost 15k in 2019 but made 15k in 2020. My 2020 gains will be taxed as making 12k. Now if I  made only 2k in 2020. I don't pay taxes on that 2k and that 1k left over goes to my taxable income. Consecutive year losses doesn't just make it compound either. It just make a different deduction pot later down the road.

Edit 3: Something I forgot to mention but another poster did. Losses on wash sales don't apply. Look up Wash Sales if you don't know what it is.

Edit 4: I attempted to make it clear but failed to do so. The Capital Loss is a deduction, not a credit. This means that it isn't exactly a 1-1 solution. What I was trying to convey is that a Capital Loss can lower your taxable income. This doesn't means that you will get 3k back in  a return but that you taxable income is reduced by 3k. So if you are in the upper limit of a tax bracket, that 3k offset to taxable income may mean little. But if you are in the lower end of a tax bracket, that 3k may be able to put you down another bracket so you can qualify for other deductions or credits.

Edit 5: removed realized to avoid confusion with Tax Credits."
2021-05-09 11:03:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah... I'm willing to bet that the majority of the people in this sub are in the 10% to 12% tax bracket, so losing $3,000 is going to save them -at most - $360 on their taxes. 

Yay."
2021-05-09 10:25:56,wallstreetbets,"So losses = good, correct?"
2021-05-09 10:33:45,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure they offset gains.  Doesn't remotely make you whole from losing principal.
2021-05-09 11:48:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah maybe don't take tax advice from this guy or WSB in general.

>If I lost money one year but gained money the next. My 3k deduction gets applied to the Capital Gains tax first. If I lost 15k in 2019 but made 15k in 2020. My 2020 gains will be taxed as making 12k

If you have a NET loss of 15k in 2019, you take 3k off your taxable income (this is independent of deductions, standard or itemized) and you carry forward the 12k of net loss. In 2020 if you didn't trade at all, you could take another 3k off the loss carried forward and then it would be 9k, etc. etc.

But if you made 15k in 2020 you could use the entire loss carried forward of 12k to offset this, and you would only pay taxes on **3k** of gains.

>Even if I gained in 2021, I can still use the 2020 capital losses to offset all taxable income sources.

Wrong. If you gained in 2021 you would be required to use up your loss carried forward to offset it FIRST before trying to apply it to ordinary income. Capital losses offset gains COMPLETELY and can be carried forward year after year. Capital losses can only be used to offset 3k in  ordinary income, and only if you have a net capital loss for the year."

2021-05-09 11:57:35,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure capital gains in subsequent years eats away at the carryover loss. Eg I lose 15k in 2020, so 2020 taxes I use the 3k deduction and my carryover loss is now 12k, but then 2021 I manage to make 10k, so my capital loss carryover going in to 2022 is only 2k."

This is not correct. If you have a $15k total loss in 2019, you receive a capital loss deduction of $3k in 2019, and a capital loss carryover of $12k. If you have $15k in gains in 2020, the capital loss carryforward offsets the first $12k, and you are taxed on a $3,000 capital gain. You then have no capital loss carryforward."

Since it's a line item, and not found under itemized deductions. You can still use the Capital Loss deduction even with a standardized deduction. The Capital Loss deduction is applied first to your Taxable Income then the standard deduction gets applied. So if you made 100k in Taxable income. The Capital Loss deduction would make it so that you get taxed on 97k. That's the amount that would be looked at with the standardized deduction."

2021-05-09 18:54:46,wallstreetbets,"The loss from a wash sale still gets applied eventually as a net amount though, right? For example, if you make $10k realized gain from GME stock and 1 week later take a $30K realized loss on GME stock, you won't get to deduct the $30K as capital loss but instead deduct $20K instead (taking into account the previous $10K realized gain). So the net deduction should be the same?"
2021-05-09 19:26:47,wallstreetbets,"IIRC, you can technically still claim the loss if you exit the position that generated the wash sale within the same calendar year. The loss technically should be added to your adjusted cost basis when you bought back in.  

Not an expert. I just read some stuff online"
2021-05-09 18:44:39,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve never understood the 3K limit on loss deductions. Why should larger losses only be able offset gains?
2021-05-09 10:55:46,wallstreetbets,"Your totale capital loss would get dropped up to a maximum of 3k per year. A actual yearly loss can get carried over. So a 15k loss on investment becomes 12k when filing a loss deduction in one year. The 2nd year, that loss goes down to 9k, rinse repeat. The Capital Loss is best described as a finite deduction that is tied to the amount of what you lost.  Once that deduction is used up. It is gone. When filing and using previous years losses. You do have to put what the original loss amount is and if you used the capital loss deduction previously. That in turn gets calculated of how much ""loss"" is left."

The $ benefit of a deduction is only the amount times your effective tax rate.  The $ benefit of a tax credit is the full value.

You are NOT being made whole for your loss."
2021-05-09 11:01:20,wallstreetbets,You are not understanding what he is saying. Deducting $3k from taxable income will not make a dent in the $3k you've lost.

Should you not take everything you read on here with a cup of salt?"
2021-05-09 11:22:31,wallstreetbets,I see what you are saying now. This is why I used everything in context in the terms of capital loss. I was attempting to avoid the view of a tax credit for that reason. It's isn't exactly about being made whole again but utilizing your losses to help you can gain more tax deductions and credits in the end or offsetting future gains. I will add an edit to explain that more clearly.
2021-05-09 11:06:20,wallstreetbets,"If you, and the OP, are talking about the instant negative impacts. Yea. Sure. However that isn't what has been posted. Capital Loss is what it is called. The idea is that over time, the deduction offsets the loss. That is how it is written."

2021-05-09 11:30:40,wallstreetbets,"They own so much Fibre optics about 10 mill miles worth. They own more miles than all companies combined. So the big companies Verizon , Comcast etc are paying them to use their 5g ready network. So instead of building new towers etc they have basically smaller antennas that the big towers will bounce their signal of Uniti Antennas when service area basically runs out. So instead of buying let's say AT&T and hoping their 5g stock goes up buy the stock supplying the big cpmpanies. Basically much like REIT for Real Estate this is the REIT of Tech. So instead of owning Wal-Mart I would buy the company that Walmart or Home Depot etc pay rent to."

2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes! 

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/q29ncm07m3y61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=e400362006ce7ce4571361731cece094ba3b9d38)

GME is back at the top again this week. GME was briefly overtaken by MVIS last week to become the most discussed stocks. The drastic drop in the stock price after its rally muted the discussions. This can be reflected in the sentiment as well. AMC has experienced a continuous decline in discussion volume and now is in the 8th position. 

 **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** 

https://preview.redd.it/sdfgfdncm3y61.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc44dd645aa9f8fdba923805c7013156328d8b70

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Majority of stocks gained in mentions this week following their earnings report. The returns were a mixed bag for the companies even after exhibiting stellar growth. 

**Rocket companies($RKT)** shares fell 16% on Thursday following their first-quarter results. Even though their revenue increased by 236% and net income by 170%, investors appeared to focus on the guidance provided by Rocket. They said that they expect to close a loan volume of $82-$87 Billion which would represent a significant decline. This along with rising interest rates and inflation concerns caused the stock price to tank. 

**Etsy($ETSY)** was also trending due to very similar reasons where they reported exceptional first-quarter results but management guidance for the second quarter was mediocre. The stock was down 13% but a lot of users were extremely bullish on the company and were considering the drop as a good entry point for long-term hold which is reflected in the sentiment. 

**Corsair($CRSR)** also delivered an exceptional quarter with first-quarter revenue increasing by more than 72% to $529MM. The growth majorly came from their Gamer and Creator peripherals segment which is far more profitable than the regular systems. Even though Reddit and Twitter users are bullish on the stock, the stock still sold off more than 6% from the top after the earnings report. 

**Peloton($PTON)** had a wild week with the stock dropping 15% on Wednesday following a full recall of their Tread and Tread+ treadmills. The US CPSC had called for a recall months ago but the company had initially resisted the accusations. The recall of more than 130K units is expected to be a logistical nightmare.  

**SOME FAQ‚Äôs:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

That said, please don't let this be the final iteration. 

The NLP is likely the trickiest part, but to produce some *really* useful data, you should also find a way to find the age of the accounts being analyzed, and find some way to give each tweet/comment a unique-ness score, as compared to all the other comments/tweets in the same timeframe or on the same topic.

2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Case for Canadian Cannabis 2: Electric Boogaloo First post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5k7s7/the_case_for_canadian_cannabis/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So, with earnings in companies like ACB and SNDL coming up this week, I think it's time to take a look at all of this again. I won't rehash my discussions about supply chains and marketable brands here, because I already talked about that in my last thread.

Instead, I wanna talk about earnings. Historically, a lot of these Canadian weed companies have had some pretty shit earnings, and they're debt has carried at way too high capacities. Here's why I think that's about to change.

Earnings have consistently been improving, especially during pandemic times. Let's face facts, more and more people are starting to like weed. The pandemic put a lot of us in our homes with nothing better to do than to spark up every couple of hours. 2020 generally saw improved earnings for a lot of these companies as people began more actively using marijuana over things like alcohol. Personally, I think this trend is gonna continue. As a former dude who drank way the fuck too much, moving to an American state where weed is legal got me to transition from drinking to smoking or using edibles. While I still drink, it's very rare and I generally use weed because I can wake up the next morning and not feel like someone drove a train into my head. It's also been cheaper in the long run. I used to spend 40 bucks on good whiskey that would last me a week, sometimes a week and a half. Now, I spend 30 bucks on weed that lasts me two weeks. With the news that American legal sales recently hit all-time highs, I think we're going to see this trend continuing as people transition to more regular cannabis use. This increasing trend will only bolster what I mentioned in my last post about supply chains and marketable brands.

Additionally, the Biden Admin is discussing cutting the amount of nicotine allowable in cigarettes in half. I believe that this type of action will trend towards cigarette smokers turning to marijuana instead. While I've not read any direct studies or anything on the matter, I've had three different friends who all used marijuana to help alleviate withdrawals from quitting smoking and then became regular cannabis users. While obviously the submarkets for alcohol and tobacco products will remain plenty strong, the push for American legalization is going to continue to leech consumers from those markets into the cannabis market. Increased social acceptability and turning from other ""sin products"" to marijuana are going to combine with the supply chains and branding advantages Canadian Cannabis already holds to create a power house when America fully legalizes. 

For the above reasons, I'm staying bullish af on companies like ACB, TLRY, etc.

Edit: so this has gotten a little more attention than I ever expected. I only really planned the first of these two posts and this one was more impromptu this morning. That being said, it seems like some of you are actually interested in what my dumbass has to say. I'll probably put something else together when a few of these earnings go through. Obviously, this isn't financial advice and you probably shouldn't listen to my autistic bullshit, but for those interested, I'll keep it up. Now I gotta figure out what I'm gonna name the next one."
2021-05-09 08:09:27,wallstreetbets, I'm staying bullish  on **Cannabis itself**

Pfft amateur."
2021-05-09 11:15:14,wallstreetbets,I have a heavy investment in CRON because of the Altria investment..  they literally sell their product in every gas station in the US.  I cant help but think it will be successful. Especially with cigarettes getting such a bad rap lately.
2021-05-09 08:46:54,wallstreetbets,"First and foremost, there's a large disconnect between weed and weed stocks. That should be obvious. But secondly, my anecdote + uninformed opinion: I'm a FL card holder who fucking loves one or two solid vape puffs in the evenings while netflixing with my wife, but I'm currently on travel and haven't used it in a month. Despite the fact that I was a relatively mild user, I can absolutely tell a difference in my own cognitive ability and my overall focus during the day. What I'm trying to say is that I really should cut back, and like you said, its already not very expensive. Idk how many people out there are like me, but to me it seems like a product that will experience a huge boom from legalization, and then a significant dropoff. When its all said and done, I think it'll be in the same class as herbal tea or wine re: how ubiquitous it is in the American home, and companies will always be struggling to make loads of money."
2021-05-09 09:13:50,wallstreetbets,"While the stock is currently down, I bought in on high tide at like 58 cents a share and sold for 85 cents a month ago. I believe it‚Äôs hovering around 60 cents again right now"
2021-05-09 17:12:10,wallstreetbets,Cannabis stocks will start booming during 2022 congressional elections as it will be a democrat call for votes. They will promise federal legalization if re elected. They won‚Äôt legallly pass before then.
2021-05-09 19:24:03,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt use it , hate the smell of it but the sector has probably one of the biggest potential right now . the biggest company in revenue has a market cap of less than 6 billions ! the potential is huge . Right now there‚Äôs a high volume of short because  even tho Legalization will happen no one knows when . Furthermore tlry just merged with aphria which attracted a lot of shorts. Another gama squeeze is overdue !"

2021-05-09 17:43:14,wallstreetbets,"So, you're giving the case for cannabis 2, and all you say is ""earning have been consistently improving,"" with no numbers or evidence. Whose earnings have improved? Aphria posted very weak results and scared everyone else with their explanations during the conference call. In what way have ACB, CGC, CRON, CGC, SNDL, etc. y had better and better earnings. Are any of them generating positive cash flows?  

I'm more sanguine towards LPs relative to MSOs than most people, and think you have a good point with tobacco/alcohol addicts moving to cannabis, but to see that show up in this next set up releases is way over optimistic."

I'm currently traveling and have been without for a few days and feel fine. I think you're not wrong that it'll be a huge boom and then have a dropoff, but I definitely still think it's going to be a larger market more comparable to alcohol or tobacco than herbal tea or wine. I think it's going to come out more highly profitable than niche industries like that. I do appreciate your opinion though, and I think there's certainly some credence to your ideas."
2021-05-09 10:35:24,wallstreetbets,"> and then a significant dropoff

2021-05-09 08:30:11,wallstreetbets,"A big part of that is there's a massive short interest in them combined. ACB alone has a ridiculous 25 percent short interest. Since these stocks go multiple days without heavy volume, they wind up in positions of consistent downtrends. When stocks with high short interest don't have volume, they go down. I'm constantly praying for more volume in ACB every day, lol. It's had trouble in the past, but is getting its shit together. Shorts just wanna make a quick buck by shorting a company into oblivion, it's obnoxious."
2021-05-09 09:06:02,wallstreetbets,"> just seem to bleed money

2021-05-09 11:31:05,wallstreetbets,"I like TLRY as a major pharmaceutical marijuana distributor. I admittedly don't have a position with them yet, but I've looked into them and think they'll have the biggest foothold in pharmaceuticals. ACB will have the largest distribution of premium products, and they'll have the largest North American distribution with their Mexican license."

I'm mainly just looking to start a conversation. A lot of these weed stocks are overlooked because a lot of us got shit on early and aren't realizing that a lot of these companies have turned their shit around."
2021-05-09 12:22:03,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, I have not sat down to do a full blown technical analysis. I do think that it is underpriced where it's currently at though. The most conservative price targets for its current position are in the high 9s. I do think that, after earnings, we could see it settle in the 11s or higher. It really just needs some volume to beat out its short interest."
2021-05-09 09:56:40,wallstreetbets,I give a lot of reasons in my previous post why American cannabis is going to likely suffer over Canadian.
2021-05-09 15:55:48,wallstreetbets,"Eh, I'm not really paying much attention to SNDL, I'm more focused on ACB"
2021-05-09 08:39:03,wallstreetbets,The American MSOs are better investments based on any metric. The Canadian LPs have no pathway into the us and it‚Äôs not guaranteed they will.

Once the SEC says is ok to up list that will also mean that companies like Canopy and Tilray won't be delisted for owning American companies.  The minute American cannabis stock can up list will be the same time that LPs can start acquiring American companies.  It won't be cheap for LPs but its ridiculous to think that they have to wait for full legalization to enter.  The only thing stopping LPs currently is the fact that they would be delisted.

Also i am not talking about cross country imports.  That will take a long time, i'm talking about acquiring American companies."
2021-05-09 17:51:01,wallstreetbets,"You're probably never going to change your viewpoint, but I thought I would try. The US MSO's are already largely at scale in the majority of states that are legalized for medical and recreational. They will get the head start as more states legalize to scale. They have shown that they can scale efficiently and most of them are already generating positive cash flow and positive EBITDA. I use EBITDA because of section 280e taxes which are like 75% of their REV lol. The US gov't has nothing to gain by including language to let the Canadians bring their grow over the border. Meaning the Canadians that want a footprint in the US will have to M&A or scale themselves. They'll be behind the race a tremendous amount. They also have shown they just bleed cash and they can't bully any MSO anymore. How will they even generate equity to fund their entry or M&A into the us market? Share offerings? Good luck with that. Just FYI, the big 4 MSO's are already too large of a market cap to be acquired by any of the Canadians. CGC is the only one that has an agreement with TRSSF. Random statistic: CURLF generated positive cash flow and EBIDTA, made more revenue in 2020 than CGC/APHA/SNDL **COMBINED**, and yet the market cap is sitting lower than CGC's. ü§î"
2021-05-09 08:43:28,wallstreetbets,"So you haven‚Äôt been paying attention.... legalization highly unlikely. Most likely it will be decriminalized and left to the stages to decide, and each state has its own license structure and been giving out licenses for years, therefore, even if CanLP is allowed to come in, they will have to pay to play, which means buying the us Mso‚Äôs.... they are not gonna be allowed to come in and do whatever they want... that‚Äôs for sure"

2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ALIBABA (BABA) 

Hi here I want to tell you about what I think is the most undervalued stock right now. It can be a huge value play here‚Äôs why:

GROWTH : 37% yoy in revenues, cloud business with now positive Ebita and growing at 50%.

The company operates in the online-retail market (mainly) in China, which is expected to grow its GDP and surpass the USA in 2028.

Debt and Moat: Low debt, can pay all its debt with cash, so it can be considered a financial fortress as Buffett uses to say.

Alibaba has definitely a moat with can be seen from different points of view:

1) Network effect = The fact that the 53% of online- retail sales is from Alibaba and its platform creates a continuous increase in the number of users.

2)Barriers to entry= In this market there are only few players becoming a sort of oligopoly.

3)Economies of scale= Alibaba has shown its ability to scale, and so to increase its revenues without decreasing its profit margins, and it is able to grow and at the same time to reduce the ‚Äúper-product-cost‚Äù.

4) Substitution costs= Alibaba operates with online- salers which probably have made investments in order to position themselves in the Alibaba platforms, and it could be a huge cost to change platform.

PRICE: Alibaba trades at 25/26 PE, forward PE of  20. And here nothing else to say. Considered the future growth is very cheap.

WHY IT IS UNDERVALUED: It is undervalued because market hates uncertainty and I think that the market fears are 

A) Usa-China relationships

B)CCP, because it is mainly a dictatorship and for example the ccp can do whatever he whats with its companies and population

‚Äî> WHY THE MARKET IS MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE: 

CCP is in continuous competition with USA, and I think that it will never destroy his ‚Äúdiamond tips - companies like BABA or Tencent.

CCP ,as Charlie Munger said at BRK annual meeting in Los Angeles, has discovered the ‚Äúformula‚Äù that is a form of economic-regulated capitalism.

For these reasons I think baba is hugely undervalued and as its fair price could be 320/330$ per ADR share.

P.S.
Sorry for my English, I am ItalianüòÇ"
2021-05-09 06:50:57,wallstreetbets,A company started by a man with a head that size? It's gotta be a good company
2021-05-09 06:23:17,wallstreetbets,"People tend to forget that the CCP needs companies like Alibaba for their international political strategy. Example: Alibaba has installed their European logistical center in Li√®ge, Belgium, my home country. Recently, newspapers in Belgium have been publishing about security reports that talk about risk of spionage (obviously) because Alibaba has the duty to cooperate with Chinese secret services and provide access for them. 
Companies like Alibaba can offer jobs and prospects to Western countries, which is of strategic importance to the CCP. They will never ever kill off such a company."

2021-05-09 04:42:46,wallstreetbets,"My listening post picked up the following chatter:

One problematic thing that I've run across with respect to the uranium play has to do with enrichment. Fundamentally, the richest ore (yellow cake) needs to be taken from 0.7% natural level of isotopic abundance to 3% isotopic nuclear fuel level in order to be fissionable at a level acceptable for energy production.

To get ore from 0.7% to 3%, uranium enrichment is required. At the moment, enrichment is a highly controlled process, subject to multiple regulatory and geopolitical constraints (primarily because enrichment is beyond the 3% level leads to potential nuclear weapons proliferation). Fundamentally, this places an inherent limitation on ore producers, as they do not control the production of nuclear fuel."
2021-05-09 08:58:36,wallstreetbets,"Using Uranium as fuel to get to other planets, maybe. But our future in energy is not on Earth. The push from fossil fuels toward electric renewables requires more storage capacity than our current resources allow. What we need to do is think much much bigger.

The only ones in the world able to produce uranium dirt cheap is Kazakstan and they do not produce nearly enough for even a third! Why do you think Sprott recently aquired UPC and listed a physical uranium trust at preciesly this time? Why do you think miners actually buy uranium instead of selling It? Why do you think instutional money have been POURING into the sector this year (look up the 50 day rolling average, this is not some retail craze. Most people are as narrow minded as you)? Global demand cannot be met for a spotprice of under 60$, thats a double from now. Mines arent inking term contracts due to being lowballed. Most good mines are debt free due to institutional funding. Even in the most bearish scenario that every reactor is turned off (its not though, its a slowly growing industry. Look up reactors coming online vs offline on world nuclear) that amounts for 10% of the Global electric grid. Something has to replace that right and the probability is high for gas, now that requires some infrastructure which requires time and money and guess what? Keeping the plants open and buying expensive uranium is a hell of a lot cheaper during the transition than importing electricity and in that scenario its still not enough uranium for a phase out! Uranium is a contrarian investors wet dream since people underplay how large nuclear is and how much electricity comes from it and a lot of people dont like the idea of nuclear or even the thought of it! But that doesnt mean its not a good investment, even more so beacuse there is people like you that root against it or are missinformed so a lot of people wont even see it coming."

.. It is hard to see how this will result in a major squeeze, however, because Uranium demand is also incredibly *predictable*. If you build a reactor, you know exactly how much of it you are going to need for the next 60 years, and you can, if you so care to, stockpile that entire supply in a warehouse next to the plant. A lot of operators do this - not for the full life of plant, but keeping several years of fuel on hand. So prices will likely go up some to get some more production on line.. but.. spike?

I'm in favor of diversification, but what ends up happening, like in Germany, is they start burning coal again because they need more baseline power, since renewables are inconsistent.  

I'd rather see a push into 4th generation nuclear that eats waste and can't melt down, combine with wind/solar/storage so we can minimize fossil fuels to the greatest possible extent.

Can build smaller and modular too.  China and India have already started down this path."

Talk to people in the power industry about wind and you'll get a better picture.

My company services the motor side.  They use a 15 year life on the power calcs, but you won't find a turbine that goes 6 years without failures.  They break like clockwork, and downtime is significant.  None of those costs are included in any of the cost comparisons.

2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir (PLTR) Monte Carlo -60 Day Outlook \*Disclaimer  - I built this model using data since PLTR IPO'd (152 trading days) which isn't a huge data set. 2020 was probably not the best year to use as a base model year, do what you want with your money, I obviously don't know where the price is going or I would not have built this.

\*\*The model only uses price data and doesn't look at earnings (which is Tuesday), fundamentals, insider selling, etc if you want to go read about how Alex Karp or Peter Thiel sold 275 million. & 500 Million in shares go read another DD

\*\*\*Model uses positive drift because it starts at IPO, price since Feb doesn't look like positive drift

POS: Long 700 Shares, Short 1x Jan '22 27C, 1x Jan '23 30C, 1x Jan '23 35c.

I built a Monte Carlo simulation to help make Palantir Tendies since the stock has been slapped back down to $19/share from its high in January. A look at the stock price since IPO:

[Remembering when those PLTR tendies came so easy...](https://preview.redd.it/599wmdagf1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd1baf4fa2ed08ebf2158eba39c4a14d66740c5)

Looking at the top 20 daily percent change days, we can see since IPO top 20 days where PLTR has gone up have been bigger in magnitude than the top 20 down days. This is good for us holding long positions. 

[Top 20 up days by daily &#37; change](https://preview.redd.it/8mfajlrre1y61.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53ae9ac4ae158b5241942b644462ab46ab819385)

[Top 20 down days by &#37; Change ](https://preview.redd.it/4zrorfmye1y61.jpg?width=718&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ed083e595dc7f3edc36d76603de708a56bfdaf5)

For the model, I took daily % change for every trading day since IPO, from there I found average daily percent change (aka drift) and standard deviation of daily percent change( (aka volatility 6.26%). Since the average daily percent change is positive (.67%), we can say PLTR has positive drift (statistical proof that stonks only go up). This was calculated since IPO, meaning it may not be the case in the future.  

&#x200B;

[some wrinkle brain math](https://preview.redd.it/bfwi3fl7g1y61.jpg?width=685&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d267252ddf7da2e91eb704fdf55307f734bd603)

&#x200B;

[Daily Percent Change ](https://preview.redd.it/3ng1hmqhg1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4de51e9837a03b6e8e9a1cd2e1d784ecbed6f8f0)

&#x200B;

From here I took the last closing price ($19.75) and added drift plus/minus a random value equal to some number in between plus/minus 6 standard deviations (assuming a normal distribution.) to find the next day's closing price and continued that until the end of the simulation, Then repeat the simulation 10,000 times. If you want to read more about how a monte-carlo/random walk works, go read on Investopedia or something.

Here are the outputs:

 One year: 

[Is pltr going to the moon? - statistically, it is possible. ](https://preview.redd.it/8vyjfj6nj1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=0442d6e8c04f5093b8b54e7cfd71409a7cbe458c)

[252 is the number of trading days in a year](https://preview.redd.it/p7fw572rh1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=6457f8ee7d3609b4ff8e7c38381fd92cb04b505d)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Since a year is too messy to really get anything useful here is the prediction for the next 60 Days (42 trading days)

[Pick a price between green and red line](https://preview.redd.it/5ufmrp0ai1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=c262c5c8be936f36e95edf555e7685a38ab62b91)

The confidence interval refers to how many of the scenarios fell underneath that line (remember this was run 10,000 times). So out of 10,000 Monte Carlo moves, 95% fell below the green line, 5% were below the red line and 50% were below the blue line. Basically, the green line is your faggy-d for a long call, the red line is a cheap hedge for a long put, and the 50% line is the ""most likely"" outcome. Prices are 5%: 12.21, 50%: 24.14, 95%: $46.73  Also the distribution of outcomes:  

&#x200B;

[Price Distribution for 60 day Monte Carlo - Most common value \~$21\/share](https://preview.redd.it/m33x6t4mi1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2c91921bfef6229c2957b90d33d3bb2818f6400)

Does it work??

To see if the Monte Carlo even works I truncated the data in the model by limiting the dates used to predict future price and made it predict the price for days that are already past. I then plotted them vs how the sock actually traded that day. 

[from Mar 21-May 21 stock underperformed model](https://preview.redd.it/yzyzj16ek1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=d452f72e47593ce17b574b6b626407f6b1426d56)

From March to May, Pltr stayed with the prediction for about 10/42 trading days then underperformed compared to the predicted price. If you wanted to speculate you could go long looking for a regression to the 50% confidence interval. 

&#x200B;

[From Jan 21 - Mar 21](https://preview.redd.it/11u5zuprk1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=57db219c2000bf3273751a5b4866c56b54ea57ae)

From January to March PLTR followed the 50% line for \~23 days then moved to the 5% line. hedging with long puts around 5% confidence interval would have likely made big tendies.

&#x200B;

[From Nov 20 to Jan 21](https://preview.redd.it/lxkddo0cm1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4251559b1db81bd610a7a4d7cc1d83fb591c7f99)

From November 20 to January 21, PLTR traded at or above the 50% confidence interval.

The man is trash, and he only cares about money. He profits from you goons imagining him to be in some way your peer. To him, you are useful idiots, and he will leave you on a rotting planet after he mines the last bit of cobalt by the end of a riffle.

He is an Edison, not a Tesla. Get real."

Hans Asperger managed to accommodate himself to the Nazi regime and was rewarded for his affirmations of loyalty with career opportunities. He joined several organizations affiliated with the NSDAP (although not the Nazi party itself), publicly legitimized 'race hygiene' policies including forced sterilizations and, on several occasions, actively cooperated with the child ""euthanasia"" program.

2021-05-09 19:50:34,wallstreetbets,"I have it, had no idea Elon had it but thats cool"
2021-05-09 06:39:31,wallstreetbets,"Are you his PR person? Or did he give you 0.0001% of his billions? 

He's not one of us

Wake the f up dude this is sad"
2021-05-09 06:44:14,wallstreetbets,"That is what School Skipping Greta Thunberg has. Imagine all the good she could do if she put her ""super human"" power toward something constructive like Elon!"
2021-05-09 06:52:21,wallstreetbets,"All this Gay crap, Trans, some things I've never thought of or could FATHOM , YUCK . I do not care what anyone does in the privacy of their home and no one should care. Its just something to make certain types feel superior. I need to google superiority complex. I have heard of inferior complex but not superior complex. Everyone has a preference and like VOTING, lol, it should be private ."
2021-05-09 07:14:51,wallstreetbets,Elon has businesses to make billions of people's lives better good for him!
2021-05-09 08:17:36,wallstreetbets,"Fucking Appalling that you‚Äôre somehow comparing yourself and everybody on here, who use that term in a derogatory fashion, with somebody that actually is on the spectrum. It‚Äôs gross and I wish it would go away.  Spend some time around people with Autism, severe Autism, and you‚Äôll never utter those dumbass words again. I promise you. Unless you‚Äôre trying to convince me everybody on here throwing this garbage around is on the spectrum. If that is indeed true or you are, please accept my apology. But, it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs hate speech. I wish folks on here would realize that. It really takes away from the validity of the information people are trying to provide here. Hard to trust somebody that doesn‚Äôt understand this basic tenant of human respect.

Edit: cool‚Ä¶downvoting. Prove me wrong.

Edit 2: Still waiting. This fucking guy below is really helping the cause. Total ignorance is a MF."
2021-05-09 03:27:15,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs an alien from the planet fkurmum stuffed into human skin...watch his twitchy ass movements ... they prove ur an idiot üëÄ
2021-05-09 03:55:46,wallstreetbets,"Well, with ever expanding characteristics and shit added every day, we all are on the spectrum nowadays.  Other than people love to claim it for some reason"
2021-05-09 04:57:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeahhhh, keep coping.

What are you doing to save those kids in Africa you claim to care so much about, exactly?"
2021-05-09 05:17:01,wallstreetbets,One of us

2021-05-09 05:33:48,wallstreetbets,eLoN mUSk bAd MaN
2021-05-09 06:34:42,wallstreetbets,"Announcing you have something that technically doesn't exist for 8 years seems unprepared. 

It's similarly retarded that he is claiming he did all those things, when in reality he wasn't even a co-founder of Tesla. It doesn't mean Elon is a tool, but he is overestimating his contributions."
2021-05-09 04:32:19,wallstreetbets,Bazinga
2021-05-09 04:51:50,wallstreetbets,Elon is a burger? Not surprised lmfao
2021-05-09 04:58:47,wallstreetbets,I can't wait until I'm on the mars colony taking the pledge of allegience to father elon.
2021-05-09 05:15:35,wallstreetbets,almost all of us have been autistic since 2020
2021-05-09 05:23:37,wallstreetbets,Except he is not a retard
2021-05-09 06:07:58,wallstreetbets, Bill gates could jab him in the arm and fix him.

2021-05-09 07:08:01,wallstreetbets,One of us! One of us! One of us!
2021-05-09 07:34:54,wallstreetbets,"Asperger's doesn't exist anymore, it's not official medical terminology, it's just used by people that don't want to say they're on the Autism spectrum."
2021-05-09 08:54:20,wallstreetbets,"ONE. OF. US.

2021-05-09 04:57:32,wallstreetbets,"You could edit him bald and he would make a perfect dr. Evil. 
Like, ‚Äúoh they thought it was gonna hit 1 dollar,  Drew Carey isn‚Äôt here tonight....bogdanoffs, drop it to 54 cents now.‚Äù

2021-05-09 04:57:51,wallstreetbets,"True story, hypnosis can be used in medicine."
2021-05-09 05:06:24,wallstreetbets,isnt it obvious he is THE AUTIST?
2021-05-09 05:39:08,wallstreetbets,Our most valuable retard
2021-05-09 05:55:22,wallstreetbets,It really is a superpower
2021-05-09 06:38:10,wallstreetbets,"What is Asperger's anyway. Oops sorry, ill google it. He is highly intelligent , Musk is a genius. Ok so i looked it up. Most genius minds are not great with social situations. Yes i looked it up ty..haha. I would like to know who has great social skills in 21st century. I have never seen and dealt with so many awkward ppl. Always !! In stores, restaurants, work, all OVER. Just really not aware? Guess that's the word. On phones when you meet friends for lunch, most never say excuse me if they knock your aging as$ down in stores.  All Z gens are just pure narcissistic with selfies.puleasssse. . Asperger's sounds like a label from some envious person i am sure."
2021-05-09 06:42:52,wallstreetbets,I think that was pretty obvious from any of his longer interviews and it‚Äôs the main reason I believe he might actually be a genius because all geniuses or most are usually very socially awkward
2021-05-09 06:48:00,wallstreetbets,Elon open a new platform  so.we can trade
2021-05-09 07:09:09,wallstreetbets,"Our guy is so smart. Now the headlines are about him bravely admitting this rather than what they were earlier this week: his toxic work culture and absurd wealth. He even gets the limelight off his awful sketches this way.

Overall a 10/10 move. Only announcing he‚Äôs now a transgender, disabled woman of colour may have resulted in better press."
2021-05-09 07:10:08,wallstreetbets,And overnight all my tendies are wiped out... Wow.
2021-05-09 07:10:25,wallstreetbets,I always knew something was off about Elon
2021-05-09 07:24:01,wallstreetbets,One of us. One of us.
2021-05-09 07:25:15,wallstreetbets,No shit sherlock :)
2021-05-09 07:29:02,wallstreetbets,I thought you could only reveal hidden things?
2021-05-09 07:29:40,wallstreetbets,You Mean Assburgers Syndrome ?
2021-05-09 07:32:26,wallstreetbets,Asperger are stubborn and never give up
2021-05-09 07:33:43,wallstreetbets,This is so awesome. I misunderstood so much about him before. My faith in him has increased ten fold
2021-05-09 07:42:41,wallstreetbets,Aspie here. Elon the wannabe space slaver can go pound sand.
2021-05-09 07:43:14,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs actually technically qualify to special, you guys are just fucking retards"
2021-05-09 07:45:00,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, who doesn't these days?"

2021-05-09 07:52:28,wallstreetbets,I have to say Elon musk was pretty good on SNL
2021-05-09 08:19:20,wallstreetbets,He is a fucking billionaire. I don't consider that one of us.
2021-05-09 08:27:34,wallstreetbets,"Self diagnosed Asperger's, so hot right now"
2021-05-09 08:29:33,wallstreetbets,asshole billionare but he likes memes!!!!!
2021-05-09 08:41:04,wallstreetbets,"He's an imbecile looking for attention, that's what he is."
2021-05-09 08:49:08,wallstreetbets,I wonder how long it will be until people learn Hans Asperger aided Nazis murdering children....call it Autism / ASD
2021-05-09 08:51:02,wallstreetbets,Fuck Elon Musk
2021-05-09 08:53:18,wallstreetbets,One of us? This is the most stupidest thing I've read for a while and I'm retarded and read retard things. He's nothing like us.
2021-05-09 08:56:06,wallstreetbets,Well he‚Äôs not really like one of you. He‚Äôs an uber rich billionaire who was given a great deal of wealth by his daddy who owned emerald mines in apartheid South Africa. Unless your money came from extreme low wage mining and you‚Äôre a billionaire (which you all are not) he‚Äôs really nothing like you.
2021-05-09 08:58:22,wallstreetbets,He did mention 420-69 haha setting up his birthday üéâü§£üöÄüåïagain

2021-05-09 09:05:18,wallstreetbets,I knew you guys would love that he is an autist!!!!
2021-05-09 09:14:13,wallstreetbets,That explains his creativity.
2021-05-09 09:40:14,wallstreetbets,Does this mean anyone that shit talks him on reddit is ableist?
2021-05-09 09:41:45,wallstreetbets,OURGUY
2021-05-09 09:41:56,wallstreetbets,"Smart move, now they'll have a harder time talking shit because they'll look like insensitive assholes for making fun of an autist."
2021-05-09 09:44:22,wallstreetbets,But the leftist will now target his autism because they are so tolerant and loving....

2021-05-09 08:44:59,wallstreetbets,This is underrated comment. Bravo
2021-05-09 11:34:02,wallstreetbets,I can't believe the guy you work with haven't launched a spaceship yet.

2021-05-09 12:41:33,wallstreetbets,They must go to the meetings on different nights.

2021-05-09 06:49:29,wallstreetbets,Lmao! Yeah tbh I already assumed he was Autistic. As an actual autist I can usually identify my brothers and sisters.

2021-05-09 11:00:13,wallstreetbets,Or JFK announcing he has a headache.
2021-05-09 11:20:58,wallstreetbets,Eltons gay?
2021-05-09 11:34:57,wallstreetbets,I wish he wouldn‚Äôt have done this‚Ä¶ people with autism already have to deal with so much bullshit now everyone is going to think it‚Äôs cool to have it.
2021-05-09 11:56:12,wallstreetbets,yeah he didn‚Äôt even really announce it he just said he was the first to host with aspergers .. or at least the first person to host an admit he had it which is a joke lol

that's why he opened the show that way

he started the battle with a shield spell."
2021-05-09 08:11:49,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but a lot of people just don‚Äôt give a shit about labeling everyone. Him being autistic doesn‚Äôt do anything to describe him or who he is. A lot of people are just weird without a diagnosis."
2021-05-09 10:46:02,wallstreetbets,I knew after the first interview he did on the Joe Rogan experience.
2021-05-09 10:08:45,wallstreetbets,"If I had to guess he's leading with it so if his timing seems off or jokes don't quite land, try not to judge him too harshly."

2021-05-09 07:34:55,wallstreetbets,I imagine Tesla will crash the hardest of all the SP this year.  It's a cult stock valued with magic and fairy dust.

2021-05-09 06:58:45,wallstreetbets,He was born of money and pretends he‚Äôs successful

2021-05-09 05:31:39,wallstreetbets,But perhaps we get more successful after the squeeze and we get rich

2021-05-09 09:12:17,wallstreetbets,"My wife and I were talking about this yesterday when discussing bill and Melinda gates. I stated that I bet because their children are now grown it‚Äôs because bill had aspergers. 

She looked confused and I said that I bet almost all really successful business men have it. I even mentioned both Steve Jobs and Elon. Here is why:

They are impulsive
They are persistent and like to use the same phrases over and over
Depression
Intense focus on limited numbers of things
They don‚Äôt like eye contact
Don‚Äôt grasp social cues
Inappropriate responses to social norms (laugh at inappropriate times etc)
HATE change
Unable to form social bonds

All these things are things that help a ceo abandon their family and focus on business. Steve Jobs was a prime example. Despite naming the Apple Lisa after his first child he flat out refused to acknowledge publicly she was his child."
2021-05-09 09:55:26,wallstreetbets,"FWIW, there are more people on the spectrum who are successful that most realize...  even if the minority of folks on the spectrum.

With literally decades of experience  here, I swear to you this is true. 

We say and do weird shit with bad timing.  Our ‚Äúlayup‚Äù attempts at humor is often disastrous.  Sometimes we don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt show up even though were right there.

But if and when we fixate _hopelessly_ on things most other people aren‚Äôt good at and have the right people around us to help with ‚Äîyou know‚Äî _everything_ else.... It works, sometimes exceptionally well.

They just call it something else ‚Äúso fu@kin weird‚Äù ‚Äîsocial elites find it uncomfortable, even gross, but you know what... f**k em.

This obviously doesn‚Äôt apply to all of us, but do not count yourself out find that one thing ‚Äîand keep it weird, unapologetically.

He's very rich, sure. But the dude works 100 hour weeks, has multiple failed marriages with estranged kids all over the place, clearly no social life, few friends, a shaky relationship with his family, unrelenting media attention on his every move, and massive pressure riding on him every single day.     
Is he happy? Maybe he is because that's what he wants from life. I wouldn't be happy in his shoes though."
2021-05-09 14:31:36,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't call stealing wages from employees successful. All of the 1% should be giving their employees livable wages, but instead keep it all to themselves while people suffer and our world literally burns from climate change.

2021-05-09 09:48:19,wallstreetbets,"It's possible. The terms Asperger's Syndrome has been out of favor for many years. Today the term used is Autism Spectrum Disorder. Those formerly diagnosed with AS would fall under that. 

That said, if he was diagnosed as a kid they might have used the term. 

I also believe it's the case that many people use the term AS to distance themselves from ASD because of the stigma. Many people don't understand that ASD covers a wide range of behavior."
2021-05-09 05:16:27,wallstreetbets,"I saw doctors from the time I was like 11-12 years old all the way through 33 that diagnosed me as depressed, bi-polar, ADHD, insomnia, etc., they all said the same thing.

I went to prison from Jan 2016-June 2018 and 6 months in,

scheduled a meeting with the doc.

Walked into his office, asked him if I could read the big medical book with all the diagnoses, and he allowed me too.

Within 15 minutes we both correctly diagnosed me with borderline-personality disorder.

Looking in that book and seeing those symptoms, I'd never seen a clearer picture of my life.

It's amazing how much my life has changed and improved since then."

2021-05-09 04:57:14,wallstreetbets,"For anyone else curious, Asperger's is related to autism (which I didn't know).

https://www.autismspeaks.org/types-autism-what-asperger-syndrome

> Asperger syndrome, or Asperger‚Äôs, is a previously used diagnosis on the autism spectrum. In 2013, it became part of one umbrella diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5).

EDIT: Apparently autism speaks is not a reputable source of info. It was the top search hit for me. My bad! Waiting to hear of better sources of info from folks. SORRY! Didn't know.

EDIT 2: Not sure if Autism society is any better, but they say something very very similar:

> Asperger‚Äôs Disorder was added to the American Psychiatric Association‚Äôs Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) in 1994 as a separate disorder from autism. However, there are still many professionals who consider Asperger‚Äôs Disorder a less severe form of autism. In 2013, the DSM-5 replaced Autistic Disorder, Asperger‚Äôs Disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders with the umbrella diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.

2021-05-09 09:33:24,wallstreetbets,"I agree. It also probably helped him relax some. Sure, he's spoken in front of lots of people many times, but this is a different arena and I could see him getting nervous. It'd be like saying, ""I suck at public speaking"" - him getting out something that can result in potential awkwardness takes off the edge. But still, yeah, it was a cool thing to do and took some balls. People who have it can say, ""Hey, it's possible for me to be really successful, too."""
2021-05-09 05:25:06,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but we all know, that when it walks like an Asperger and talks like an Asperger, it has a 95,7% chance of being an Asperger, under the right circumstances."

2021-05-09 10:57:02,wallstreetbets,Not his first kid. The one you refer to is his sixth.
2021-05-09 10:48:54,wallstreetbets,He was likely diagnosed young
2021-05-09 07:34:44,wallstreetbets,It probably wasn't dated when he was diagnosed.
2021-05-09 07:42:51,wallstreetbets,"Not if you‚Äôre someone in the autistic community. I‚Äôm autistic if you‚Äôre looking at the DSM5, but if considering the DSM4 it would‚Äôve been identified as Aspergers.

They essentially merged under the same umbrella recently. While a lot of folks still identify as an Aspie many started going with the new terminology due to the history of the name even though it helps separate the variances. Want to know the horrible history of the name Aspergers?"
2021-05-09 09:53:59,wallstreetbets,It isn't being given out anymore but old diagnoses are still valid.

2021-05-09 08:59:40,wallstreetbets,I think the reveal here was well orchestrated because it puts anyone who wants to be critical of his performance on the defense to avoid their criticism being likened to an attack on someone's difficulties as a result of their neuro-diversity.

His Dad didn‚Äôt provide child support for his three kids and they grew up with Mom working 4-5 jobs just to put food on the table.  This silver spoon theory is BS.

What sort of revisionist history of his life is that?

Elon left to live with his dad when he was 10 or 11, shortly after they divorced.  His younger brother joined him a little later."

And he's using his own money to further humanity.  He's absolutely not in the same category as other billionaires."

2021-05-09 14:37:26,wallstreetbets,"My wife and I have a friend whom many years ago refused to introduce us to one of his best friends.

Eventually, he explained that this guy was insanely cool and he did not want him and us getting along and our friend feeling left out.

In time he trusted us enough to introduce us. 

My friend's best friend is now like my brother, we are closer than my own blood and even though he lives in Florida and I am in Kentucky now he and I talk at least once a week. 

We, however, made it a point to never leave our mutual friend out, and now years later we are all 4 amazingly strong friends who get along great and love each other very much. 

We knew our friend was on the spectrum so we worked with him.

It took a shit ton of work and self-reflection to make it all work, I can easily understand how some folks just do not feel like putting in that time."

2021-05-09 09:08:16,wallstreetbets,Autistic people care about labels though. Diagnosis and identifying your autism is a huge fucking factor in living a happy life. Just because YOU don't care doesn't mean nobody does.
2021-05-09 10:21:15,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure him having asperger's is literally describing him and who he is. No single detail entirely describes somebody.
2021-05-09 09:32:22,wallstreetbets,the only label that matters on elon is imperialist
2021-05-09 09:44:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I don‚Äôt get it. I take medicine for depression and anxiety, but I don‚Äôt talk about it and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt part of my personality. It‚Äôs just a thing I deal with. We all have shit we‚Äôre dealing with."

2021-05-09 11:48:17,wallstreetbets,It matters. My son is Asperger's as well and trust me. It matters. My son is also obsessed with space and Spacex. It's a really big deal even though it was totally obvious.
2021-05-09 10:23:55,wallstreetbets,Diagnoses actually do quite a bit to describe people lmao. It's cool to be ignorant though I guess.
2021-05-09 10:08:45,wallstreetbets,Sad truth
2021-05-09 10:16:20,wallstreetbets,Well it does a little to describe him. At least this gives us a better understanding of why he comes off strange sometimes in social situations. It doesn't take away from any of his accomplishments or who he is obviously.

A good analogy would be someone who steps on other people's toes a lot. If she's just clumsy, others will likely forgive it since it's not intentional. If she's a professional tightrope worker, but still does that, people will consider her an asshole.

I do now see his ""people will die"" statement regarding mars eploration a lot less negatively. For a normal (""neurotypical"", if you want to be pc) person it would be a hint that they don't see much of a value in the life of other people. But people on the spectrum are simply very often very blunt. So if he says ""people will die"" he means exactly the same as if a normal person says ""unfortunately and despite all our efforts we won't be able to erase all risks""."

2021-05-09 09:02:18,wallstreetbets,"No offense to you or any other apes here, but I don't believe that any amount of money could make any of us ""like Elon."" The guy is a genius."
2021-05-09 09:21:48,wallstreetbets,"That is only somewhat true. Elon has invested ALL his money (which wasn‚Äôt from his family it was from PayPal) into his business ventures. If spacex failed one more time he was bankrupt. 

Also Errol, Elon, and other family members have openly talked about when they left South Africa they were fucking broke. 

In fact Elon‚Äôs sale of PayPal is what made that family rich, he allowed his brother to open a chain of restaurants, put his sister through film school, he paid to get his dad out of rent controlled housing in Canada. 

It‚Äôs true his dad was somewhat wealthy in South Africa but everyone forgets why they moved. Apartheid. The government took his dads money.

Didn‚Äôt he grew up with an abusive father that beat the shit out of Mrs.Musk and verbally denigrate Elon.
Elon and his brother then move to Canada penniless and work their way into the US, meanwhile his father impregnated Elon‚Äôs Stepsister.
Just FYI...."

Access to capital will help you stay solvent, reinventing the way that we pay for transactions (PayPal), creating a viable EV market and driving forward battery technology (along with solar), and sending people into space cannot be bought. 

Love or hate Musk, the dude is a visionary and should be respected for his accomplishments."
2021-05-09 09:33:39,wallstreetbets,"That is the dumbest thought process ever. 

And to discredit someone's accomplishments because of their parents wealth is just as ignorant as dismissing someone because they are born poor.

2021-05-09 06:56:15,wallstreetbets,"To be fair psychiatry is not an exact science by ANY means. We are still in the super early stages of understanding anything about brain disorders. Most people don‚Äôt fit 100% of the criteria of a certain disorder, and most will have overlapping conditions. People with anxiety usually have depression too and vice versa, people with bipolar usually have both, and the list of overlapping things is endless. The DSM criteria are nothing more than a general guideline of how it should be in theory, but in practice often times things are a lot more mixed and nuanced. Most of the time making a correct diagnosis and a correct therapy is much more of a guessing game (based on experience) than anything else. It‚Äôs very empirical, it also involves a little bit of luck I‚Äôd say. If you go to 10 different psychiatrists the chances they‚Äôll say 10 different things is high, and it could be that none of them is necessarily wrong, it‚Äôs just a matter of identifying what‚Äôs the main disorder that fueled all the others. I hear them discussing and  having quite different opinion on patients all the time (I study these things). Obviously if you have a little bit of knowledge of the matter you can assess your own situation better than anybody else if you know what to look for, but it‚Äôs really hard to get a crystal clear picture. Glad things got better for you and you were able to identify your condition, all the best for the future!"

If you get cheap products it's because someone was paid shit to make it for you, or mine the materials for it. The reason we don't think about it or see it is part of a term carl marx coined, called false consciousness. I highly recommend reading a bit about it. Powerful stuff.

2021-05-09 14:51:31,wallstreetbets,"I was in my 40's when I was diagnosed with adult ADHD. When my therapist starting going through symptoms and checking them off so many lightbulbs went off.

I was a great football player because the plays were rehearsed to hell and back, I knew them, I could function without thinking 99% of the time. 

I was a great Marine because everything is structured, from the clothes I wear, to how I eat, to when I shit and how I wipe, everything was structured from my cover to my laces. It was comfortable, I actually enjoyed it and excelled. I enjoyed the tactical planning, preparation, rigid structure punctuated by pure adrenaline moments where my non-stop preparation meant I felt like I was in a movie and able to anticipate actions. 

I got out and got into IT, where again, everything was structured, laid out, massive tomes of instructions for me to pour over, hundreds of hours a month I am left completely alone, just me and the machines that do exactly what I say and only what I say. I can crank my music to deafening levels and no one is around to tell me to turn it down. 

I do digital marketing now. the minutia of data available via trackers and data collection allows me to target from the largest to the smallest demographic at will and I can build and design advertising campaigns that allow me to grow a company and then use the analytics tools to create awesome reports that show growth and profit or how to reach expectations. All of it is data and math, it adds up, it never changes, 2+2 is always 4. 

Now that I know that this love rigid structure may be due to my ADHD and that I can take advantage of it instead of being depressed about my inability to break out of molds and anxiously thinking through every possible conversation I can finally relax a little.

It has been life-changing.

2021-05-09 09:47:17,wallstreetbets,"Neurodiverse is the new, softer term for this.  As we come to understand more about the 'condition' and just how many of the greatest minds of our past suffered from this ""thinking differently"" it's being seen as a superpower.  

As a result, big business and Intel agencies are actively seeking neurodiverse individuals due to their superior ability to spot things and recognise patterns most people miss.

- When he founded Zip2 he was 24 and basically at a crossroads in his life (go to grad school or start a company during the .com boom)
- This success allowed him to found PayPal
- PayPal's success allowed him to buy Tesla and start SpaceX

No doubt he's turned Tesla into something incredible, but arguably a lot of these billionaire CEOs got really lucky in timing (and being born to well off families), wonder if he'd be doing something similar if he never got PayPal money."

Unlike Bill Gates I didn't have access to a modern (for the time) terminal and hours of free computing time at a university.  My single mom couldn't afford a computer for us.  Instead I borrowed time on my grandfather's ancient TRS-80 when everyone was already using x86s.  

Had a rough go of things in my teens and dropped out of high school and I eventually got a leg up in IT and have turned that into a programming career, but it has been a slog.  If I had rich parents maybe I would have still been a fuckup, who knows.  More than likely I would have at least gone to college.

By far the biggest indicator of success in this country is your parent's socioeconomic status.  Yes there are outliers, but they are the exception to the rule.

Elon was born with every advantage in life, but then on top of that got lucky by cofounding a startup that didn't crash and burn then got bought by Paypal.

2021-05-09 09:08:47,wallstreetbets,"Regarding the diagnosis is a guessing game bit, it helps to know that a diagnosis is simply a category that explains symptoms. Sometimes multiple categories can, in those cases we look at which one explains them best, and often a diagnosis is influenced by the kind of help wanted/needed and to which categories it's offered. My diagnosis is autism (pdd-nos back then), but I meet all criteria for ADHD too. They said autism because I have social impairments not explained by ADHD, and because the help I was going to need was not offered by institutions specializing in ADHD. We really have no idea what disorders are, our system of diagnosis is the best method we got to get people the treatment that probably works. But it's by no means an accurate model of the hows and whys of mental illness. There's still so much to learn."
2021-05-09 07:29:56,wallstreetbets,"This is why I'm so apprehensive to go to a psych about my issues and also to a counselor for family ones. Its a total luck of the draw that you get one who won't let their own emotional biases get in the way.

The last person I went to was a vapid young 20 something year old with fake nails who wouldn't stop interrupting me to talk about herself like a LOT. I sometimes wonder how many marriages end during counseling because the counselor has a positive or negative bias towards men or women or how many marriages stayed together because one had a bad family experience with divorce.

Psychiatrists and therapists are like cops to me, they're just humans and unfortunately are prone to being as incredibly neurotic and biased as the next human."

2021-05-09 08:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Voluntary unions and voluntary organizations is cool, non voluntary unions and non voluntary organization is not cool. You want more competition in the labor market and in the market in general first. Making labor too expensive is a great way of not doing that and also benefits corporate cartels by choking their competition... so don‚Äôt advocate for powerful state unions, advocate for voluntary unions. 

And even then it doesn‚Äôt matter what your wage looks like if the money you‚Äôre being is payed is worth nothing, and your nation produces nothing. 

Thinking of the world in such zero sum ways is short sighted. I‚Äôm sure if you ask workers of Elon musk if they liked working for musk most would be a resounding yes. I‚Äôve been apart of unions before and the atmosphere atleast in the unions in america today is not ‚Äúsolidarity‚Äù there‚Äôs a lot of infighting and ridiculous rules that makes it worse for everybody. 

The only reason stock trading today is ‚Äútheir game‚Äù is because of progressive interventions since FDR starting with the federal reserve central bank cartel. Doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt make money at it either, most do."

2021-05-09 11:31:36,wallstreetbets,"In college, he wrote basic word processors to sell to his college mates since official licensed ones were expensive. He built computers for friends for money. He networked extensively to get connections (I'm aware this is extremely common in business school but still). All that showed his extremely strong work ethic and business-mind. Together with all of that, he graduated with a double major from an Ivy league U-penn.

He founded a startup Zip2 which was seen to be good enough to be acquired by compaq (which you're writing off as luck for some reason?). Then used that money to create a company in an entirely different field (online banking) which was successful enough to merge with confinity to become PayPal.

Then, he created SpaceX and on the side, established Tesla, in which he had a hand in designing their first roadster.

Even if you don't think he's good at science, engineering, or even computer science, he's at worst, an extremely shrewd businessman. He's far from just ""marginally above average"" 

I think you're significantly overestimating the abilities of your average redditor. Even the wealthy here are, instead of using their money in entrepreneurial ways like Musk, blowing their money away on Tesla FDs."

All those diagnoses are so hard to accurately pin down since they overlap so much but it's all comes back to complex ptsd."
2021-05-09 07:57:07,wallstreetbets,"Just go to a few ones if you can afford it, and then choose the one that resonates better with you. IDK how viable this is for you if you are in the US, everything healthcare-related there is 10x more expensive than it is anywhere else. Yes they are just humans, and as with all jobs there are more skilled and less skilled ones, more naturally talented and less talented, but first of all they are just people with their story and their experiences, so it can very well be that they don‚Äôt hit the mark. However, in particular if you have a psychiatric condition, the chances it will get worse and worse if left untreated are high. The more you wait, the harder it is to bounce back. And don‚Äôt even get me started on people self medicating on the internet thinking they know what‚Äôs best, relying on comments on the internet by total uneducated randoms when deciding to take certain incredibly strong drugs with terrible and potentially long lasting side effects. I‚Äôve seen people get to the point of no return (die) with self medication, thinking they were on to something, when in reality they kept going worse and worse without realizing. If they are lucky they come to the psych ward in awful conditions and hope to get saved, and sometimes it‚Äôs not even possible anymore. Do not do this. A shitty psychiatrist is still 100 times better than trusting a shitty suggestion made on the internet. Even just for the fact they know what usually works on people and what‚Äôs dangerous from experience. For counseling, you can do a lot by yourself by reading books made by professional, studying, talking to reasonable friends. You don‚Äôt necessarily need a professional, although if you can find someone you trust it‚Äôs much better, because you‚Äôll have extra support and extra conviction you‚Äôre doing the right things. However, if you have certain medical conditions that go beyond the usual everyday life struggles that you could fix by just doing things differently, a psych is your best bet. It might not be perfect, but it‚Äôs better than anything else you could do by yourself. Take care!"

> Their brains operate 10x faster and it‚Äôs as though it is a ‚Äúthird eye‚Äù.

Their brains work at the same speed as everyone elses, it's just that there is some difference in filtering and processing some forms of stimuli, plus usually some impairment in inhibition. Hyper focus is one of the consequences of this, which can be a positive in some circumstances for some individuals, but it can very easily just lead to tunnel vision and obsession too. I agree that the thinking and/or functioning of non neurotypical persons can be very beneficial since it's often ""out of the box"" compared to neurotypical persons, but it doesn't give them any magical abilities, other senses or a faster brain. It just means their brain operates differently which means they experience the world differently. 

Also, a disorder is ONLY diagnosed if there is a negative for the individual or the people around them to function in society. In other words, if you think differently but experience no negative consequences because of it than you do not have a psychological disorder."

If humanity progressively continued to reduce its birth rate, it's not just going to stop at the level that you want it to, it'll reduce until we hit the opposite issue.


Unless you were endorsing eugenics as a method of control over evolution, which would be abhorrent, it will not work how you expect because it will be a case of natural selection.

Regardless of this, the point is that the trait itself is not one which is going to be dominant in natural selection specifically because of the reason I already outlined.

 Some countries are actually experiencing falling birth rates to a detriment, like Japan; your concept would see cultures erased.


I don't see why you'd want everyone to have autism, rather than just wanting everyone to understand and accept autism and accommodate it such that the people who do have it experience social equity.

One last point, I don't see the argument of wanting everyone to have it as **any** different to the idea of wanting to eliminate it via eugenics; either way is hoping for a certain type of people not to exist.

2021-05-09 08:43:29,wallstreetbets,You're right they must be horizontally democratic unions that actually represent the worker and the people. Business unions that just act in favor of business and act like the working and employing class have anything in common are just there to deceive you.

Anyone can form their own union if they so desire and band together with their coworkers.  Unionizing gives a lot of abilities to essentially audit your boss to argue for raises and more.  Plus the NLRB helps (or is supposed to, Trump put a union buster on it that Biden ended up firing) workers stand up against unfair labor practices or ULPs.  I recommend reading Sections 7 and 8 of the Wagner act to learn the powers of unions.

&#x200B;

Also direct action without fully unionizing has been shown to be successful as well.  March on the boss, picketing, etc helps bring attention and negative press.  Unions work and they raise wages in the community as well.  Not all unions are for the worker- some just aim to maintain the status quo, which is why we need to build a popular labor movement that reaches across the aisle and recognize we're all getting shafted by the same people."

Gee sorry he coauthored two or three papers one of which was some weird covid study where the majority of Ns were male lol. So essentially worthless.

Musk, is good at seeing an idea, and getting people with the know how to build on it because he has money that other smart people dont and parents who are rich to fall back on. He is a flawed human being; even more than most.

I am not downplaying how yes my ASD will make specific things harder for me but at the same time I do not have any problem at all being 'defined by it' as it affects so many different parts of my existing from how I literally perceive the world (sensory issues), how I have my interests (very specific, almost obsessional) and just general quirks like random repetitive behaviours I do. 

Autism isn't like anxiety, depression or even eating disorders because you aren't born with those like you are born with autism. There is no pure 'cure' or 'treatment' specifically for autism outside of simply management strategies like there is for the other psychopathologies that I mentioned. As such, please do not say things like this without actually doing any research into what it is actually like to live as an autistic person.

Back before they decided it a good idea to simply ply schoolkids who have ADHD with drugs to pacify them, doctors recognised kids suffering from the condition were mostly just 'bored' with the things being taught, and simply needed to channel their excess energy into subjects they were actually passionate about.

Amazing TED talk here where Sir Ken Robinson explains this and how the lady that invented CATS the musical (who couldn't sit still in class due to ADHD) was prescribed ""going to dance school"" as a remedy, by her doctor.

Same time I was doing it, the son of Erol's home video rental got into the same business.

The next example for myself has been comparing a millionaire made rich by true blue capitalism‚Äîmaybe a business owner pulling profits from retail, paying employees legal but poor wages/benefits. Comparing that to a millionaire who bought, say, 50 coins back when no one believed a digital currency was worth anything and then sold this week. The world impact of the latter is, theoretically, pretty low and my fake person has likely been contributing to society in the past decade as their digital wealth has appreciated. I feel like wealth created in the latter scenario also has more of an ability to do net good. But who knows.

2021-05-09 12:13:18,wallstreetbets,"You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about, and I would recommend studying the topic before spewing half-assed knowledge on reddit. You‚Äôre a zero-sum thinker (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_thinking), but that doesn‚Äôt mean the world is zero sum. Here‚Äôs an article explaining why the world isn‚Äôt zero sum (https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2019/january/trade-zero-sum-game-chocolate).

Since you don‚Äôt like ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù here is another example. If we exchange ice cream and a chicken, nothing changes except ownership. But let‚Äôs say that for you, the cost of producing chicken/ice cream is 10/40 dollars (because you‚Äôre a good farmer but a shit ice cream maker) and for me, the cost of producing chicken/ice cream is 100/5 dollars (because I‚Äôm really skilled at making ice cream). In a world where we each need 1 ice cream and 1 chicken, but decide mot to trade, you need to spend $50 dollars worth of effort to produce chicken and ice cream. I need to spend $105 dollars to produce these two items. So in this case, just making two ice creams (which costs me 10 dollars) and exchanging 1 ice cream for your chicken is a win-win for both sides. I spent only 10 dollars to make two ice-creams, and you spent only 20 dollars to make two chicken. If we couldn‚Äôt transact, it would cost us a total of $155 to get two chicken and two ice cream, versus $30. This is why trading is not a zero sum game.

Thinking that trading is a zero sum game because swapping A and B means nothing has changed, is an ancient and unproductive way of thinking, and is not how economists or any sane intellectual would view the world. 

Please don‚Äôt pretend to understand how the word ‚Äúzero sum‚Äù is used or defined. Zero sum thinking is rarely true and it‚Äôs a dangerous and stupid way to think about the world."

2021-05-09 15:10:46,wallstreetbets,"it can absolutely be beneficial to learn more about yourself, but as another poster said, having the reductive mindset that you're limited to that ""condition"" will ultimately hinder your ambition and ability to be successful."
2021-05-09 13:34:50,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. And a lot of times by associating yourself with that disease you tend to fall victim to it in the sense that you can feel more helpless. Instead of saying I have a disease but I'm a strong enough person to work through it a lot of people say well I am this, so it's not like I can change anything. It's been importantly noted in psychology for years to do this with people with schizophrenia and many other diseases. I.E saying I have schizophrenia not I am a schizophrenic."
2021-05-09 14:44:03,wallstreetbets,And you're probably a huge pussy
2021-05-09 15:03:44,wallstreetbets,I literally work in the medical field around this kind of stuff but okay üòÇ you'd be surprised at what great feats humans can accomplish with their mental health when they accept no limitations and push themselves. But keep living a mediocre life bud.
2021-05-09 15:04:18,wallstreetbets,Am I a smug prick? Or am I just saying there's more people can do to help their health and you're in denial or are scared about it because you yourself don't push yourself.
2021-05-09 11:26:01,wallstreetbets,Yes and that is limiting for those people. It‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing for their lives but it is literally limiting lol
2021-05-09 12:18:44,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure there are autistic people who thrive in non-technical careers.
2021-05-09 15:19:15,wallstreetbets,"That's not what I'm talking about at all üòÇ it seems to be you're projecting your issues you have about yourself onto me, and you seem like a very angry and sad person so there's clearly no need to continue this conversation. I never once said I'm perfect or don't have issues, you're just talking out of your ass. All I'm saying is everyone could push themselves harder and stop making excuses for themselves like you seem to be. I also have financial issues because I decided to open my own business at 20 which got hit by covid so Im not taking a traditional path. I think you really need to focus on yourself man. There's a lot of anger in you for no reason. Clearly something I said affected you personally. Good luck in life bud."
2021-05-09 15:19:55,wallstreetbets,"And the fact that you are so amped about money just shows me that you may be financially sound, but you're not a person that anyone wants to be around and you probably don't have many friends."
2021-05-09 12:22:40,wallstreetbets,"I can totally relate.  If I fall in love with something I'm passionate about mind, I can do that intense hyper focus for months on end practically 16 hours a day 7 days a week as long as there's no other distractions.  Then I find I need a massive break from it all.

And yup, simple day to day tasks that other people think are super easy can often be excruciating.  Good to find a partner (in business or life) who can make accommodations for those shortcomings and recognise whilst you might 'think differently' to others that does not necessarily have to be handicap and can very much form part of a super healthy balanced relationship where you augment each others skillsets in really unlikely ways.

Also find the concept of ""zero-time"" helps with my creative outlets, which is literally the practice of doing 'nothing' for days on end, and allowing your brain to just 'think' and unwind.  Both Einstein and Steve Jobs practiced this.

Good article about it here:

2021-05-09 10:33:58,wallstreetbets,"Why not look into labor history and find out the reasons why we've made any gains against the elites at all?  


If you want to roll up and give up like a sheep instead of learning to get beyond our differences that's on you.  Can you really not adapt your perspectives to the needs and urgency of the reality of our global society?  


India managed to engage in a 300 million person general strike within the past year.  If we had that many people on both sides of the aisle marching for workers rights we'd be making gains that allow us to push further to address the gaping exploitation of the systems by the elites while they let others starve."
2021-05-09 10:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Unions have worked and they continue to work around the world. Get fucked.

The world is changing whether you like it or not and the working class of the world is starting to fight back again. India had the largest strike in the history of the world only a few months ago, there have been strikes all around the global south throughout the past 2 years. In Bolivia, in Chile, in Colombia, in Myanmar, in Thailand, in Iraq, in Iran. This is only to name a few off the top of my head.

There have also been demonstrations and strikes all over Italy, in the US, in France, in Russia, in Hong Kong and in Germany.

This isn't the 1990s anymore. Reagan and Thatcher are all long dead and Neo-liberalism is on its way out. What remains is to fight for a brighter, better and more equal future for all people everywhere.

All peoples must get organised."

2021-05-09 13:39:53,wallstreetbets,How is stating a fact that he gave a title to himself whining?
2021-05-09 12:01:37,wallstreetbets,">On an actual statistical basis, you‚Äôre wrong because there are millions of families globally that have the wealth that Elon‚Äôs family did (well off but not super rich) and yet there are not millions of Tesla/SpaceX companies (pretty obvious). 

That's not a logical response.  Your logic is that lottery winners earned it.

That one won while others lost doesn't mean the winner win only because of skill.

John Carmack, someone who is inarguably far smarter than Musk, failed at rockets because he lacked billions in backing.

But the really important factor in Musk's success is his ability to get the employees to kill themselves working for him.  Musk bragged about how people who couldn't handle 120 hour work weeks failed out of SpaceX to work for Apple. Meanwhile Musk was busy dating Hollywood starlets and bragging about how he never missed his 5 (at the time) kid's ball games because his family was important.  So he always made plenty of time for himself."
2021-05-09 11:47:10,wallstreetbets,"Or it‚Äôs just ‚Äúboth‚Äù - luck and obsessive focus on his business (to the detriment of his health and relationships). The commenter talked about statistics and then shared an anecdote, it was a bad argument. It‚Äôs possible to acknowledge someone‚Äôs hard work while also believing that they should pay significant taxes and also realize that they had to have significant luck to lead to such massive success. 

Tearing down other peoples‚Äô accomplishments is unhealthy at best, dangerous at worst."
2021-05-09 12:24:28,wallstreetbets,Like Bill Gates. MS probably wouldn't have gotten to be what it was if his mom hasn't pulled some strings at IBM. Or if he didn't come from a well to do family (and all the cultural teaching that is implied by that) and could afford the risk of dropping or of school.
2021-05-09 12:19:11,wallstreetbets,"It's probably because he apparently became a multimillionaire, and without proof other than 'I did this, trust me guys', he used it to disprove the other guy's comment."

2021-05-09 10:52:57,wallstreetbets,"1% of people happen to be able to program, but that has nothing to do with mental ability.  There are many, many times more people that certainly *could* program, and in 20 years the percentage of people that *do* program will be substantially higher as well.

Just as a small number of people speak classical latin; it is not indicative of intelligence, nor inherently ""impressive"" to speak classical latin, although undoubtedly some people choose it as an intellectual pursuit in any case.

But back to the thesis: programming a game as a child is not a specific marker for abnormal brilliance now or at any point in the last 40 years.  Being his age it *is* a marker for familial wealth, however, which is by far the largest reason why this has become so much more common in the last few decades and was comparatively rare when Musk was 12; although you certainly wanted to downplay that fact earlier."

2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir (PLTR) Valuation Comparison with its High Growth SaaS Peers I am a data engineer in finance. I am embarking on a new journey to provide data analysis and transparency to retail traders. Stock price, sentiment and news headline can be manipulated by the street, but data is your ""seeing stone"" . Here is my quick notes about Palantir:- I did some analysis (linear regression) on growth SaaS companies. At $20, PLTR is **neither cheap nor overpriced** among peers.

\- The recent week's drop was spread across the high growth SaaS sector. If you see the price drop of SaaS stocks or simply ARKK fund, it is highly correlated to the **sector rotation** on inflation concern.

\- I saw people joking about whenever PLTR signed a deal, its stock dropped. Correlation does not mean causation. PLTR is projected to grow its revenue by 30%+, which is 300M+/y, or on average 25M+/m. To keep this growth, you would naturally expect at least signing two new 10M+ contracts each month. So please **do not get over hyped** when PLTR get a multi-million dollar contract. Think about the overall impact.

\- Despite the recent price drop of PLTR, SI stays at historical low at 2.68% by s3 partners. Total inst. holdings at 30% but the number of holders increased significantly to \~600. I heard that HFs still **wait for earning to confirm** the commercial growth due to recent sector/macro risk

\- Key stock catalyst is next Tuesday's PLTR earning after hour. Keep an close eye a few key metrics, including **profitability timeline**, **Q1 revenue growth** (especially on the commercial side) , **2021 revenue guidance**, **contribution margin** and **stock based compensation (SBC)**

\- My model shows PLTR at **$20 is the fair value** given 30% Rev CAGR & 12% discount rate for 4B'25 goal from mgmt. But VERY likely management sandbags the projection to beat & raise. There is certainly short term hype & risk. But I am **bullish** with a **2-5y horizon**

\- As of May 9, **130.8M worth of contracts signed** this year with U.S Gov for PLTR  


PS: Please follow me on Twitter [https://twitter.com/MikeyJia](https://twitter.com/MikeyJia) if you find such analysis useful. I am just starting but will continue to publish interesting data point about companies like PLTR.

2021-05-09 03:01:34,wallstreetbets,Earnings scare me. A lot of companies beat earnings and increased guidance and still went down. Could happen to palantir also or worse if they miss earnings that might cause it to free fall like rocket mortgage
2021-05-09 01:18:07,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in it for the long term. I just keep buying the dips.

2021-05-09 01:24:21,wallstreetbets,I feel like earnings may be the positive catalyst to send us to fill the gap at 30
2021-05-09 09:16:17,wallstreetbets,long holder here who buys every time i see a dip.
2021-05-09 07:54:45,wallstreetbets,Would you consider CRM part of this group? Great post btw!!!!
2021-05-09 11:16:54,wallstreetbets,I thought first PLTR was some kind of Skynet but in the end it is more like AOL.
2021-05-09 10:17:21,wallstreetbets,Earnings will decide the future of PLTR. If earning are horrible as before it will tank even lower.
2021-05-09 01:59:35,wallstreetbets,what is your opinion on c3.ai?
2021-05-09 03:03:43,wallstreetbets,"Interesting analysis. One line stood out "" But VERY likely management sandbags the projection to beat & raise."" Better to sandbag the numbers and guide lower, then beat the numbers later, than to give rosy estimates and miss the numbers later. 

Over a longer horizon, it's a great play. Short term, it could bounce around for a while, and even get hammered on good earnings. Change your time horizon and changes the investment."

2021-05-09 12:28:44,wallstreetbets,"I believe they report earnings Tuesday morning.  Not after the bell like you said.

Like that you found the total sum of new contracts YTD ($130MM).  Been wondering what that number was"
2021-05-09 19:22:28,wallstreetbets,OP could you share your source of the yearly US gov contract value?  I checked [https://www.usaspending.gov/](https://www.usaspending.gov/) but didn't find a convenient summary as in your screenshot.
2021-05-09 03:05:26,wallstreetbets,"Those companies didn't have 7 red days in a row , if it goes down more after earnings beat then that is a big buy opportunity."
2021-05-09 05:46:12,wallstreetbets,"Those companies were also up like 200% year over year and were already trading at 50x p/s.

As for your question, it is anecdotal, I don‚Äôt have a direct quote from a HF manager. But it gives you some hints, when looking at the huge price movement after earnings lately, from ETSY to Fastly or CloudFlare"
2021-05-09 13:40:18,wallstreetbets, CEO Alexander Karp received a compensation of $1.10 billion that included $797.9 million earned in options and $296.4 million in stock awards.

I have a hunch that their user interface is the state of the art."
2021-05-09 13:34:41,wallstreetbets,Might be a good idea to buy some Monday and then buy more after earnings drop (if there‚Äôs an earnings drop )
2021-05-09 07:57:42,wallstreetbets,Thank you. CRM is also a potential competitor to Palantir. CRM also offers ERP system. I did not include it because I think CRM is somehow close to mature. It‚Äôs at a different phase of growth so the multiples could be different
2021-05-09 13:35:37,wallstreetbets,And by the future you mean the price for the next couple weeks
2021-05-09 08:32:20,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs hard to say because they are transitioning into commercial.  And execution matters all. But if they do execute it well, I can imagine they will catch up quickly with CRM in 5 years, which is currently 5x of PLTR‚Äôs market cap"
2021-05-09 12:31:22,wallstreetbets,"yes, you're right. it is before market open. I tried to corrected it in the comments.

2021-05-09 16:18:53,wallstreetbets,"This company paid everything they earned to their CEO. This means everything else, from R&D to marketing to every other employee salary all were net losses to the company lol. How isn't this a bad thing?"
2021-05-09 03:59:56,wallstreetbets,"Mixed, tbh.  That's because my senior management bought into ""analytics"" without understanding where the data value for decisions actually is/comes from, and the actual users rotate too frequently to understand what they could do with it.  It's a bit like seeing a cray machine installed only to see people complaining that tetris isn't playable because it runs too fast...  <facepalm>"
2021-05-09 10:25:31,wallstreetbets,Whatever ERP Salesforce comes up with will be hot garbage. Their platforms are fucking awful.

2021-05-09 07:42:51,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for sharing. This is also how I feel. Palantir historically has been using the top down sales approach. Meaning that they will convince the c-suite or high rank gov officials first. 

But for the majority of other saas companies, they have big sales force and plenty of trainings to get users on board, like CRM or snowflake. There is still room for pltr to grow and mature"

2021-05-09 12:28:26,wallstreetbets,"I see your edit, but I didn‚Äôt invest in a high growth company for it to pay a dividend in 1 year. You‚Äôre barking up the wrong tree. If you want profitability buy KO."

REIT/T stock dividend with a hugely profitable business model, a strong balance sheet, and huge ROE. What's not to like other than that people are unreasonably bearish on the sector, and that UWMC fucking ate Rocket's lunch? 

I'm aware of short term pressures through the price war, but RKT's earnings made it kind of clear that UWMC won, and UWMC has been about as quiet as a beluga whale that Q2 is going to be bonkers. So while RKT is guiding down, the chance that UWMC guides up is high.

Add to that and the fact that a special dividend, raise in the dividend, or even a stock buyback was mentioned and you've got a recipe for great strides upward.

Add the short interest in the float, and you've got the ingredients for a highly anticipated earnings report tomorrow, and earnings call the day after.

If you have taken a look at copper futures lately, you know something is going on. I believe it's due to the current semiconductor/EV wars between the U.S. and China rn. Also with the problems between Taiwan (the world's largest chip producer) and China, there is a potential flash point. There is absolutely no doubt that it is happening. 

Now that there is some back story, get this. We're talking fundamentals now.

TRQ is trading over 50% below it's Book Value, and Fair Value (IMO). It also usually far exceeds earnings estimates by insane margins. The company is hyper profitable with a great ROE, ROA and ROI. 

It's insider ownership is roughly at almost 50% which is insane in most instances. At this point, I'm wondering how this company has stayed off the radar. But we all know it's because alot of us have been distracted by other securities.

Now go ahead and look at that ascending channel, or plot it yourself.. Need I say more?

This companies copper is going in to those GPU's that mine those sweet sweet coins. It's going in to the PS5's. And It's going into Elon's whips and starships. The decision is up to you.

‚Äú4 IntroductionSARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, continues to be a major threat to worldwide health and economic productivity. As of April 2021, there have been over 32 million SARS-CoV-2 cases and 575,000 deaths in the United States6. Most infected individuals are either asymptomatic or have mild to moderate disease characterized by symptoms such as cough, fever, and mild pneumonia7. Previous infection data indicated that 19 percent of infections result in severe, potentially life-threating disease characterized by shortness of breath, rapid respiratory rates, lung infiltrates, and oxygen desaturation <94%6,8,9. Due to the rapid viral spread, it is imperative that safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 be immediately developed for ease of worldwide deployment to end the pandemic. Despite the authorization of three vaccines for emergency use in the United States11-13 and the release of several more vaccines worldwide13-16, SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to outpace the administration of vaccines in several countries across the globe demonstrating that the current vaccine supply is far from sufficient. In India alone, there were 6 million new infections and 46 thousand new deaths in the month of April6. Some of the currently authorized vaccines are mRNA-based and have unique cold storage and distribution requirements that present extra challenges to the world17,18. Vaccines that can offer improved safety and tolerability profiles could help overcome vaccine hesitancy. Furthermore, the development of vaccines that are temperature stable can help to improve the global distribution to countries with little or no capacity for cold storage.‚Äù"

I also read my my kid‚Äôs medical school text books since I was not able to go when I was younger. I comprehended everything except biochem since they only had organic chemistry when I was in college.

Right now we use chemo to kill cancerous cells 2 ways.  Either before surgery to shrink tumors.  This makes it easier to cut them Out and get all the margins.  Chemo is basically a poison. Since cancer cells have a higher metabolism they suck up more of the poison and die in greater numbers than healthy cells.

Or we use it after surgery to kill any stray cells left behind so we can avoid a reoccurance

Inovio will cause the body‚Äôs own  immune cells to kill cancer cells without all the bad side effects of chemo.  It is the natural progression.  For example We don‚Äôt use heavy metals and arsenic to kill bacteria  anymore  Because they are poisons.

We use antibiotics."

If the science is there why would they discontinue their collaboration?

Science, and finance are my passions. I'm happy to talk about it all day everyday. I don't care about INO. I just want to talk about science, and don't want people to be misled. There are more profitable biotech plays out there that I'm sticking with. 

One of my biggest criticisms of INO is the fact that any criticism of the DD results in either insults, or is heavily suppressed through downvotes. Science operates through peer-review, and something being able to stand up to criticism. If your investment thesis can't handle a modicum of criticism why is it a good investment? This is an actual question, and not rhetorical. 

Final time I'll say it: I'm qualified to talk about both the finance, and the science side of it. Which one would you like to hear?"
2021-05-09 00:03:20,wallstreetbets,"And this is why no one takes this ~~scam~~ company seriously. Any DD should be able to withstand criticism. INO investors seem to get butt hurt instead of responding to actual criticism. To prove a point 

-	why have Roche, and AstraZeneca both terminate their partnership? 

-	Why has their promised Zika, H1N1, avian flu, Ebola, and covid vaccine never materialized? 

-	[Why is their drug better than the drugs that are much further along in clinical trials? ](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Glioblastoma&age_v=&gndr=&type=&rslt=&phase=2&phase=3&Search=Apply)

2021-05-09 16:11:54,wallstreetbets,"1. We will never know why Roche and AstraZeneca terminated their partnerships. In a conference call after Roche terminated their partnership, the CEO said that the strategy of Roche has shifted from development to aquisition and that Roche generally doesn't seem interested in the cancer space. Doing a quick google search on ""Roche"" and ""Acquisition"" would lead you to their current most acquisitions, which all seem to be in either diagnostics or in companies developing treatments for other indications than cancer. Inovios pipeline is 60-70% cancer or pre-cancer indications. Inovio is still developing the prostate cancer candidate that Roche originally paid and funded. It is currently in a challange study against other promising prostate cancer candidates.   
AstraZeneca only terminated the partnership concerning new candidates. One should note that Inovio actually had made this deal with Medimmune, which was AstraZenecas branch for new developments. In 2019 when Medimmune was discontinued the strategy from AstraZeneca changed too. Probably because they too would rather buy up competition than develop their own therapies. Inovio has actually initatied new studies with AstraZeneca with funding from DARPA to develop DNA-based monoclonal antibodies. 
2. I've responded to this in an earlier comment to you.
3. We don't know? We won't know until the results are published - its a silly question to ask in my opinion.However, taking a quick glance at your list and a few of the ""completed"" trials on clinical gov I can see that none of them have transpired into actual products. The most recent one that has published results is VBL Therapeutics where their trial failed:[http://ir.vblrx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vbl-therapeutics-presents-results-phase-3-globe-study-patients](http://ir.vblrx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vbl-therapeutics-presents-results-phase-3-globe-study-patients)Also, a shit load of those trials are either suspended, withdrawn or terminated. If we filter by ""completed"" we see 42 studies. A handful of them are basically chemotherapy comparisons which is not an improvement in treatment at all. The rest were completed more than a decade ago, which either means they would be standard of care now if they were better than chemotherapy or they failed.There are 18 trials in that list that are ""Recruiting"" or ""not yet recruiting"", which I would focus on. Out of the 18 trials, only 8 could be considered as treatments (some were actually new trials for treatments that failed earlier studies), as the other 10 are trials that either look to compare small differences in current standard of care, post-treatment possibilities and follow-up studies. 8 studies in new treatments from the list of 94.Inovios candidate is ""encouraging"" - and that is all the needs to be said for now. An encouraging candidate is a beacon of light in an otherwise dark diagnosis."

I'm talking about TODAY. And today there is a collaboration with AstraZeneca on dMAb (read INO 4802).

Any DD should be able to withstand basic criticism. If it can't then it's probably a shit investment. Anytime I do bring up a point I get met with insults. I don't care about the insults. In my 5 years of investing in biotech I have never come across people like INO holders. I care about others losing money when there are better biotech plays to be made.

Productive conversations are also a good thing, when they lead to a personal knowledge growth.

And it also feels a bit strange about getting the quite negative comment about aborted not so relevant partnership, when there are more relevant to the today¬¥s topic partnerships existing. And when pretty good news just appeared.

What‚Äôs not good is INO bulls not being able to respond to criticism, or suppressing legitimate questions with downvotes.

I'm just seeing some similar patterns of when I've been burned, and would rather not have anyone else go through that. 

Once again I could be right, or wrong. I've been both. The company has a $1.4B market cap. Let's be realistic. Comments on Reddit aren't likely to dramatically swing that valuation in either direction so this really doesn't matter. I just think it's still valuable to present a bear case which I rarely see in INO threads. 

I'm happy to have a reasonable conversation about it. And just for transparency I'm not short on it. The only areas of biotech I'm interested in investing in right now are drugs for obesity, cosmetics, and gene editing."

2021-05-09 12:15:43,wallstreetbets,"That would put it around a $3.4B market cap which I think is perfectly reasonable for a clinical-stage biotech company. I‚Äôm in a few companies that have a much higher market cap with fewer drugs in their pipeline. At $17 that‚Äôs still 2.5x which is nothing to laugh at. That‚Äôs a phenomenal ROI. I can‚Äôt comment on the short position because I‚Äôm mainly a value investor, and don‚Äôt look at SI that much. Still reading your DD‚Äôs, and will read the Bloomberg one as well. Thanks for linking it. 

Dude I feel you on that. I‚Äôm one of the few members of my family not a MD. My siblings, and cousins are going through residency now. It sounds awful. My cousin got moved to NY during peak covid during her residency. She definitely saw some shit. To top it off her dad is a psychiatrist that mainly deals with pediatric oncology patients, and those going through severe trauma. At least he was able to help. 

Funny story about the name. It‚Äôs actually just one of my initial, and anonymous. When I first found Reddit I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd end up using it so I just typed in something random. I regret not picking something cooler."

but your shot, my shot, and your wife's boyfriend's shot (aka my shot) is gonna be from one of the 6+ real pharma companies/countries that beat them to it by years. Even fucking Ocugen has a better chance than them, and all they did was get an agreement with a real vaccine developer for India to license and sell in the US."
2021-05-09 12:40:42,wallstreetbets,"I have a friend named Manon that is why I thought your name was the same. Yea for sure. The think is it is easy money to short biotech because many fail. It is also a good way to reduce to dust toxic companies like nikola. However when it is used against firms that are fighting the good fight in oncology - it makes my blood boil. Nice! Your family must be impressive tbh. Medicine is a tough road. Everyone thinks it is lined with money but you have to work very hard, be resilient and hopefully don‚Äôt lose your humanity in the process."
2021-05-09 14:40:12,wallstreetbets,"Would that be Arena? What do you think about others such as EDIT, NVTA, DTIL, BNGO, NTLA, ILMN, BMY and PACB?"
2021-05-09 18:30:04,wallstreetbets,You have received from credible replies which are overshadowed by the mElVIn ShOrtY talk by accounts established 3 months ago with 90-100% of their posts on this one stock.  I do not focus on biotech because I know my limitations.  I have some MD and D Pharm family members to consult when I am interested in something -- but the MDs are not oncologists.  Could the glioblastoma treatment be a breakthrough?  I hope so but do not know enough.
2021-05-09 13:10:30,wallstreetbets,"Ah, well that's going to be my new name when I cover lol. I completely agree with you. Shorting biotech companies can be free money. But, I'm specifically talking about companies that refuse to post data which doesn't apply to INO who does have a pipeline, and data available. I'm specifically talking about companies like Theranos. They're typically not in medicine though, and are in general biotech. I also don't really go short on companies unless there's some impending bad news (PTON was the last one). There's way more money to be made going long. Speaking of which you have any opinions on semaglutide? Their P3 for obesity seems pretty promising. Giant company so the price wont dramatically move like small cap, but seems like it could be a money maker. 

Yea, it's a bit ridiculous. There are about 22 MD's in my family that are currently alive, and practicing. Our joke is to not throw out business cards, or placards because someone will probably be able to use it in the future. A lot of us either saw firsthand, or were taught that it isn't a full of sunshine and rainbows."
2021-05-09 14:47:33,wallstreetbets,"I posted a DD on EDIT, and I‚Äôm trying to finish the next part of the series. I‚Äôm bullish on EDIT, PACB, ILMN, BMY, TMO, ILMN, CRSP, NVO, and a few companies I‚Äôm waiting to IPO. Small-cap biotech had a ridiculous run up earlier this year, and prices are starting to come down so I‚Äôm sitting on mostly cash now while waiting for a better price to buy in. There are probably more, but I spend a lot of time researching before I make a move so I‚Äôm pretty slow compared to others. The FDA is starting to play catch-up with clinical trials so it should be a pretty good year for biotech."

I‚Äôm going to be honest: I don‚Äôt know. I have a policy to not have an opinion on something I haven‚Äôt done any research on. I haven‚Äôt looked at the data, and I‚Äôm honestly probably not going to. I‚Äôm not interested in cancer treatments at the moment. I just think there are more profitable plays in biotech so I‚Äôm sticking with them. The only pharma companies I‚Äôm focusing on are complained producing drugs for cosmetics, obesity, and Alzheimer‚Äôs.

Funny, this news would be coming from CNBC-the devil of all networks; however, This FED report sums up that the crash is imminent, and timing is actually not too difficult to predict by looking at technicals of stocks & indices. The report is made available to read. So blatantly Interesting how the media NBC will insert words such as ‚Äúmay‚Äù or ‚Äúmight‚Äù (link below)

Asset prices may be vulnerable to significant declines should risk appetite fall. The link is below. For those not knowing about this, it is quite interesting.

THE FED REPORT ALSO MENTIONS‚Ä¶ risk at hedge funds and other nonbank financial institutions on several occasions as potential threats to the system. They have shorted the living shit of every high value stock.

The lurk is at bay. Report mentions...The catapult ~ more or less COVID and issues around the World both politically as well as those countries are still on lockdown - those countries having problems receiving vaccines.

A good search for insight would to watch Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting that happened days ago is incredibly informing giving you the exact picture of what is already happening about hyper inflation, etc. He gives heed and warning to typical investor10 minutes long ...talking about how expensive the simple raw materials are and how highly inflated we already are. https://youtu.be/rtlTZL3Q5ts

Also, recent news indicate, no more...but few on stock floor exchange. Odd ‚Äúat this time to hear‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think what will happen in the next few months will surprise any of us.

2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WELL Health Earnings Tuesday Was reading this article from the Motley and saw the company has earnings Tuesday. After digging a little deeper I think they might blow them out of the water. 

If all is accurate this is what I found. 

1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish 
2. They just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of his own money
3. Completed the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow. 
4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M
5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing 
6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone. 
7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.

Second, people will stay indoors even more than entry level Rona times. So Netflix and Amazon should get a nice bump.

UPS drivers and lawn care personnel will be the most impacted. Looking for an Amazon run on netting as these folks get the cicadas PPE equivalent. Not big enough to move anything though."

2021-05-09 19:35:43,wallstreetbets,"You are confusing *annual* cicadas with *periodical* [cicadas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_cicadas). 

They are different types of cicadas. The only region in the world that experiences periodical cicadas is the eastern United States. Here is a [map](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_cicadas#/media/File%3APeriodical_Cicada_Broods_of_the_United_States.png) of the broods. These regions also get annual cicadas, so they know the difference between annual and periodical cicadas as well. These periodical cicadas appear in mind bogglingly huge numbers every 13 or 17 years. As you can see on the map, there are multiple broods, so every few years a new brood will emerge, but it will be usually in a different location as they don‚Äôt overlap. Therefore, the emergence of a brood in an area will be a significant event that only happens a few times in a person‚Äôs life, so there will be news stories every time a brood emerges. The 17 year cicadas have only emerged once in my life, in 2004. I remember that summer vividly. 17 years later they are emerging again. What makes Brood X special is that it encompasses the largest area and a lot of people will be exposed to it. And naturally the news is going to report on a significant event that is happening. 

To give you perspective on just how many will emerge, you should know that in a heavily forested area, there can be more than a million cicadas *per acre*. In just my heavily forested county, an entomologist predicted that there will be over 200 *billion* cicadas emerging in a few weeks. At their peak intensity, their mating calls can be over 100 decibels. That is as loud as a lawn mower right next to you. EVERYWHERE. People have to use snow shovels to remove the dead carcasses after the onslaught because there are so many. When you drive through the woods, you will be killing thousands or just have to drive over their crunchy shells everywhere you go. Predators get so engorged from them that they literally leave the cicadas alone.  

You are being downvoted because you are misunderstanding the magnitude of this. They are not your average cicadas. If you really want to understand it, take a trip to Indiana at the beginning of June. You just have to experience it. It‚Äôs quite magical. Some people dread it, some people love it."

2021-05-09 16:40:57,wallstreetbets,"Cicada killers are quite common and they don‚Äôt only eat cicadas, although that is their main food source. Not all cicadas are periodical; only some North American species arrive en masse every thirteen or seventeen years. Cicada killers hunt the cicadas that appear every year. They are also fun to watch fighting each other. The males slam into each other at high speeds. They will also do this to you if you get near their nest which is a hole in the ground. Other times, I‚Äôve had them land on my hand, if you stick out your fingers in the air, they will land to survey the area. They rarely sting people, just slam into you."

Not might, it will be. It is a scientific fact that millions of people in the eastern United States will be inundated with trillions of cicadas in a couple of weeks.

As I said, periodical cicada broods don‚Äôt overlap much in area, so they are a significant event for that area when they do emerge. So even though it seems like it‚Äôs not newsworthy to you, it is a generation defining event that is certainly newsworthy to the people in the region where they emerge.

2021-05-09 14:14:29,wallstreetbets,"Lol agreed. Ransomware attacks increased sevenfold over 2020. Our whole digital ecosystem transformed. Our security structures and postures all had default forms of security based on people working well at work. There's so much implicit trust within most systems that security experts simply can't keep up with all the vulnerabilities. 

Using your phone, smart TV, tablet, your personal wifi, other wifi, shit ton of other devices and computers on other networks around you. It only takes one little opening anywhere for them to spread. That is unless you've airgapped your network and set up zero trust protocols as your default. 

I'll check that out. We have means to stop these things already, ways to stop lateral propagation immediately. But people need to implement them, and need to implement them now. Why I'm sorry happy I'm in the field I'm in lol."
2021-05-09 19:58:26,wallstreetbets,"You clearly didn‚Äôt read my original comment. I mentioned how there are multiple broods of periodical cicadas.

I also posted a Wikipedia article which I recommend you read because it is fascinating. 

And if you actually took the time to read the articles that you posted instead of just the headline, then you would realize they are talking about different broods local to specific areas. 

And yes, the broods are special and are a scientific wonder, so it makes sense that they are reporting on them."

I've written DD on some of these and will continue to write on them in depth.  My view on stocks is that you should pick and play on stocks that 

A) Care about reputation

B) Deliver

C) Contain economic consequences and economic challenges

I'm extremely engaged by developing and improving my portfolio and I strongly believe that investors should go big and stay mentally tough through the good times and bad. In other words, the advice that I value most is by Charlie Munger:  


>‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not willing to react with equanimity to a market price decline of 50% two or three times a century you‚Äôre not fit to be a common shareholder and you deserve the mediocre result you‚Äôre going to get compared to the people who do have the temperament, who can be more philosophical about these market fluctuations.‚Äù

 I actually hate posting in r/stocks and r/investing because posts l feel that the culture in that forum is the opposite of this advice and seems to value cowardice more than conviction. I find it incredibly annoying and sheepish. 

These are my picks, that I've researched obsessively and believe will result in substantial wealth building over time.

2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Do you think this strategy can beat the S&P 500? So lets say you do your DD on a company you think has solid fundamentals regarding P/E ratio, RSI, type of leadership, new technology that can increase company's value, multiple analyst viewpoints, any whatever else I may have missed. Based on this research you buy long call options deep ITM that expire in a year or more so you avoid the bad kind of capital gains tax. It should be a given, but you buy long calls instead of buying shares since you can theoretically invest more this way.

&#x200B;

Next part is assuming the stock goes up eventually or even if it doesn't go up, because the breakeven point is going to be really close to what the current share price is at at the time of purchasing the long calls, you start selling call options each week or month off the long call options that you bought and you aim for something like a delta of .14 so that there is a low chance of assignment.  Even if you do get assigned from a stock jumping up that much, it's safe to assume your investment has paid off as long as if the short call you sold has a strike above the break even point of your long call. 

&#x200B;

Now the reason of selling the short calls off your long calls is because you will be doing all of this on margin as well for maximum gain potential. You need a way to pay off the margin interest so that's where selling those calls come into play and you'll probably have more than enough to pay off that interest and to pay the short term capital gains tax to still have a little extra for yourself. 

&#x200B;

Lastly you would diversify among 5-10 different companies that are all in completely separate industries so they don't correlate with each other whenever there is a downturn in a sector reason being is if you go into a margin call, you can sell one of your winners to temporarily let your loser get back up on its feet so you aren't forced to sell at a loss. 

&#x200B;

2021-05-08 20:02:58,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre basically describing the futures market, with inherently less risk because it isn‚Äôt the futures market. You‚Äôll make substantially less than the futures market and this is all assuming the stock moves in the same direction as you predict (which most people are inherently less than 50%) then the gains would be also cut but the inherent fact that TIME is built into the price of long term contracts so you‚Äôre constantly losing money off that. 

Now I have done exactly what you‚Äôve described before and only had positive results when the company moves drastically in the correct direction (I had a 2 year call on Microsoft when it was priced at 50$ a share) 

A better way to beat the s&p is to find statistically relevant ‚Äúsignals‚Äù that predict a market move. Which you really can‚Äôt do right now because the market is at all time highs and is violently trending based off volume. Which is an extremely risky factor to trade off of in either direction."

2021-05-09 12:25:46,wallstreetbets,"This is a common trading technique, but I think it shouldn‚Äôt be the only trading strategy to use.  I wouldn‚Äôt do this with stocks/ETFs that aren‚Äôt very liquid or have low short term IV.   You may think a 14 delta is far enough out, but at 14 days the premium is just too small.   You need to hold until almost at expiration to retain the target theta, which then puts in in a high gamma risk situation, at which point you try to roll out.  If the spread sucks then rolling out becomes a pain.

This strategy really works best with a stock that moves very slow, and hopefully to the side your selling against.  The problem with those stocks is that there is no premium at 14 days."

They must be 9+ months out but not all brokers allow for them to be bought on margin but they can be. One thing to keep in mind is that in order for you to sell the short call for any premium you will need to buy deep in the money on the leaps which are basically going to be 50% of the stock current price, so you aren‚Äôt getting a huge advantage over just buying the shares on margin but you don‚Äôt have to worry about a margin call if stock tanks to fast with the leaps."

Honestly the way the market reacts could go both ways. When a hurricane hits the gulf and disrupts the oil rigs prices of oil go up becuase the sentiment is supply will be low but demand unchanged.

In this case oil supply won't be seriously hit but rather gasoline. Gasoline prices are going to go up temporarily depending on the state since demand isn't changing but supply is.

This could cause traders to fear that a cyber attack could hit the oil supply infrustructure network as well which might affect supply, causing oil prices to go up....

This is all speculation though. If they fix the problem tomorrow then it might have very little affect."

They just then spend more on r&d and marketing so they don't make money. Eventually they grow enough where that cost of revenue margin grows to cover all costs.

CLOV has no margin on what they sell currently, so they lose even more money than a normal growth company. They also can't grow their way to profitability. They have great subscriber growth and expansion, so if they make money on premium to claim, they will be back on growth track, rather than going out of business track."

It's not even a year the company went public via DPO and he sold over 14 million shares already. His current holding is less than 6.5 million shares. If you look at other insiders such as Ryan Taylor, Shyam Sankar, Matthew Long, David Glazer, Stephen Cohen, Peter Thiel, they also sold some although not as frequently as the CEO (yes, I know they have less shares comparatively)

Now let's look at some **counter arguments**\-

**Automatic sell:**

Looking at the number of shares in each transaction, you might argue that they are automatic sell. I know they are but if you believe in your company then why would you sell this kind of large number of shares that frequently? Like 3-5 transactions worth millions of shares every month, so early after the company went public?

**DPO vs IPO:**

You might say that the company went public via DPO and insiders need to sell the shares otherwise public wouldn't be able to buy them. I am here talking about the shares he kept selling after it went public. On the day they went public, they have already sold much larger shares. For example Peter Thiel sold 23 million shares, Alex Karp sold 13.7 million shares etc. Also, there is no shortage of float in market. On the first day of trading the volume was 338.5 million shares whereas 90-days average volume is only 74 millions. So, no he does not need to sell that frequently to keep the liquidity with demand(!). The price action rather says the opposite is true.

**Stock-based Compensations**:

You might also say their salary structure is heavy on stock based compensations. The company has been around over 13 years and he waited enough so he deserves some lambos. Yeah bla bla bla whatever as if he did not withdraw any salary each year. Now tell me why wait 13-14 years to go public?

**He needs money like everyone else:**

Another argument could be he needs to buy a Yacht or a mansion or a jet or whatever. Make the company profitable and cash positive first and then those $20 dollars stock will go to $50 or even $100 and then freaking buy 2 mansion and 3 yacht or whatever. If you keep dumping millions of shares each month when the stock kept tanking, many investors including retail and institutional, are holding large bags. Cathie alone will not be able to save it, she has already bought all the shares you sold since November 2020, and some more.

**TlDr:** Not giving any kind of financial advice. I am not going to touch PLTR unless insiders, specially the CEO stops dumping shares frequently. If he does not like the stock of his company then who the hell am I."

PTON gave weak guidance and everyone who bought puts still got shit on. I can see a similar situation here with PLTR. All it takes is some surprise new GOVT contract and the stock will moon to $25 the next morning. I‚Äôm not playing that game again.

You can do same with bezos.
You're a jack ass. Also pltr has a special structured class f stock for founders. So Alex can sell however he wants without losing voting rights.
Finally he's getting billion dollars in compensation this year. He'll have to pay taxes on it. So he has to sell at least enough to pay IRS and then some more for his lifestyle.

2021-05-09 11:31:30,wallstreetbets,"Read their S-1^(\[1\]), on page 190 it details the Executive Equity Plan and the 2010 Plan.

Combined those plans grant Karp 180 million shares in the form of options (141m) and RSUs (39m) which will vest quarterly and with an exercise price of $11.38.

*""Each Executive Option has an exercise price of $11.38 per share and a term/expiration date of August 20, 2032. Each Executive Option vests as follows: Subject to the applicable named executive officer continuing to be service provider through each applicable date, (i) with respect to Alexander Karp, 2.5% of the shares subject to the Executive Option will vest on August 20, 2021 and 2.5% will vest quarterly thereafter, and (ii) with respect to Stephen Cohen and Shyam Sankar, 5.0% of the shares subject to the Executive Option will vest on August 20, 2021 and 5.0% will vest quarterly thereafter""*

So after the stock price doubled he sold about 7% of his total compensation package for a total of $275m when his remaining package is worth over $3Bn at current prices.

One could easily come to a concl3usion that he is trying to keep the overhead lower by not putting him on the payroll perhaps? This is a sign of a great CEO and will better reflect on earnings.  Also he can always issue more shares and take a salary later.
2021-05-09 12:38:50,wallstreetbets,">Now tell me why wait 13-14 years to go public?

From what I understand they spent the better half of those 13-14 years doing R&D spending boat loads of money getting the company where it is now ^1 .  They are still spending resources getting their commercial side up and running as well as investing in their sales team, but I think by now they have their core product developed.   

This is probably the earliest they could have gone public.  If they had went public any earlier and were reporting numbers while they were getting the biz off the ground the numbers would have looked like an abortion to WS.

I don‚Äôt particularly care that insiders are selling either, but how much of the company do they own?  More or less than an average CEO/insider?  Are they selling to get ownership levels down to an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù number?  Maybe Karp wants to diversify himself into some of that coin, yo - get a piece of that action.  But what Karp does with his money is none of my business.  Maybe he likes a certain gaming retailer and wants to invest in that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. Think about it; 13-14 years ago was like 2007ish? How much AI were we really deploying back then?  People were still using iPods and the  first iPhone had just been released and still in its infancy.  I don‚Äôt think the world was ready for Palantir back then - they were way ahead of the curve and got a yuge head start on any potential competitors which will allow them to continue to dominate their market."

2021-05-09 17:07:29,wallstreetbets,They sold shares that were tied up for a while to liquidate some cash for other investment companies they are going to start up most likely and yeah maybe a nee house or whatever for their kid who knows or tuition idk... that‚Äôs what these guys do though and have a great track record of it.

It's a very old concept like buy something and three years later oh let's see how those stocks are doing, I almost forgot about that. In reality a large number of investors are managing their profile by themselves now a days. Even if some financial advisor supervise the investing activities, the investors do check them often."
2021-05-08 21:01:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah these posts are stupid. I watched a video from September 30th when they just went public. In it Alex Karp says two reasons Palantir went public is because they want to expand their business to more commercial businesses and going public would make people more familiar with them. Secondly he wanted to allow insiders to start selling their shares. This has been his plan since September and he was very public about it.
2021-05-08 20:58:24,wallstreetbets,"You are super bullish on the company you work for and also have great insider information and you still sell every quarter. 

And then you go all in PLTR with 10000 shares at $24.96 cost basis with an expectation of $50 price target by 2025. That's like 15% compound growth per year.

In my experience when someone writes a DD about a stock, specially with a negative connotation, bag holders of that stock attempt to defend their position by saying things like ""It's a long term hold"". The truth is very few people bought $PLTR keeping years of time horizon in their mind. $PLTR has been a meme stock from the moment it was discussed widely in this sub.

Most of the users in this sub are not investors. They don't buy stocks with long term plan. Most people here buy hype stocks to make some quick bucks but when early birds left and late arrivals hold the beg, they rationalize their bag by saying sweet sweet stuff. It's a part of basic human psychology and their is nothing wrong with that. When I was holding 4000 shares of PLTR and saw someone was saying something negative, I was also behaving the same way. Anyway, your comment might be a joke but mine was not."

I have just noticed now that you sold 52 calls for about 13.7K. However, when I was holding $PLTR, I also sold covered calls those were weeklies and sometime monthlies. I think leaps are poor hedge strategy because your shares are locked for the whole year and you can not sell anymore calls until you close those leaps. 

For instance, those leaps gave you $2.65 per share but you are currently down over $5 per shares."

2021-05-08 20:46:43,wallstreetbets,">I wouldn't buy anything below the 200-ma and certainly when its below both the 50 and 200.

Every single stock I bought in May 2020 was both below their 50 and 200-day MA. Almost all of them I sold over at 100% profit in less than 2 months. You might say that was a special time. With that logic and if you actually know how a moving average filter actually works, you should know that price of a stock on a random  day in Sep 2019 has an effect on that 50 and 200-day filter curve you see today (on 05/07/2021)! That means all these 50 and 200-day MA curves are severely skewed due to that rapid fall and rise of all these stocks.

>but people much, much smarter, and with a LOT more money, have already put in their bets

Most of the volume we see in stock market is due to trading activities by institutional traders/investors. Some are betting on bullish speculation and some are on bearish speculation. Most of the major stock prices are currently above both 50 and 200-day MA on a yearly chart. Now tell me the people who are betting bearish are less smart and have less money? Go and look at the option open interest on SPY. Billions of dollars are betted on both sides. So, the bearish side is less smart, poor and they do not follow these indicators. Is that what you are trying to say?

>Why would u want to buy a stock below the 200-day MA on the daily, and especially on the weekly?

All these indicators changes their level based on whether a chart is daily, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, monthly, 3 months, 6 months or yearly and so on. The shape of a chart also changes based on the frequency of the data points such as 1 min, 5 mins, hourly etc. play around with the frequency and duration, you get many different charts. All of them are real chart based on true stock price but they all will look different, all the TA indicators will look different. I would not even look at these MA indicators to buy a stock so that question was invalid.

>Use it as a place to enter and exit a trade is all I'm saying

I entered SPY calls this week when SPY was below both 50 and 200-day MA on both daily and weekly chart. I sold them and make profit when SPY was above 50 and 200-day MA. Which is exactly the opposite of you are referring me to do. 

Let me tell you one thing, stock price do not follow any predefined pattern. Once the market closes and the chart is established whether it's a daily or weekly or monthly you can then draw as many pattern as you wish by changing the variable like timeframe and frequency. If a stock price closes above it's 50 and 200 days MA line on both weekly and daily chart. Nobody, I mean nobody in this world can guaranty that that stock price will close higher on the next trading day. Period. A trend is only a trend while it last but the truth is no one knows how long it last. SPY was going up on Wednesday and then it started going down on the same day. What is the trend here up trend? downtrend or dance trend? 

TA does not work, ever. Worked, never with any amount of certainty. Give me one indicator that is only 51% correct but that 51% is consistent. If you can give me that indicator then I will bet $1000 in each trade. That tiny difference will make me billions within few years even if I start from just few thousands."

If he sold monthlies at or around 0.3 delta he could get $1.2 per share premium at that time. Based on the price action those monthlies would expire worthless. So, if he keep doing that every month for the rest of the year he could potentially gain $10-$12 per share by the end of this year instead of only $2.65 because from leap he was barely getting any theta benefit.

If weed can be grown freely, you can literally just put a seed in some dirt in your yard and let it go to town. Then you just dry the buds. There‚Äôs no processing or factory. This is with respect to growing yourself. Everything takes some work and isn‚Äôt free, but how much do you value a bale of hay? It had value, but many times less than the current value of weed. Weed would be slightly more expensive than a bale of hay, but way cheaper than it is now.

Dispensaries can be packed but that doesn't mean they are making money. How much is on front? How much is being moved because of old ""debt"" that legally cannot be on the books. This industry is still in transition from black to legal market. There are old debts that that can move a business, but once that's repaid, what now?

Some of the most successful operations will never go public because they literally have 500 million burried in the backyard in bunkers.

Doesn't mean there isn't money to be made, but the weed game is decades old on the black market. This transition will have hard times."

‚ÄúSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer: I‚Äôve always been of the view that while certainly we have to deal with the banking and financial issues that we should do them together with legalization because the [SAFE Banking Act] brings in some people who might not normally support legalization, and we want to get as broad a coalition as possible. Here in the Senate, it‚Äôs our goal‚Äîas you know, Senators Booker and Wyden and I are working on comprehensive legalization legislation.

We will hope to include things that deal with banking and finance, although we certainly think that we ought to make sure that the communities that have been most affected by these draconian laws get the benefits here, and we want to make sure that there are reinvestment initiatives and it doesn‚Äôt all go to the big shots, that smaller businesses and minority businesses get a chance to be involved once marijuana is legalized. We want to make sure, A) that they go together and B) that this just doesn‚Äôt let all the bankers, the big boys, in without taking into account that communities of color have paid the greatest price here and should get some recompense.‚Äù

2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Options Prices During A Short Squeeze I have a question that I have not found an answer for anywhere.  I am hoping some on here that have been fortunate enough to experience owning call options for a stock that is experiencing a short squeeze can answer for me.  During a short squeeze, once the stock price reaches levels much higher than anyone expected, are you able to sell your call options for a fair price or are the buyers of your calls cashing in on a big discount from you?  For example, when GME hit $300, was a $30 call going for around $270 per share?"
2021-05-08 20:14:31,wallstreetbets,"FWIW, I spent $100 on the highest possible weeklies pre squeeze. When it started gaining momentum, I sold them about a day before expiry with no problem, gaining about $4000. The squeeze started to commence, I then spent that $4000 on the highest possible weeklies (right when they started adding higher and higher strike prices). The next day, I sold them all for $130,000 total. I had zero problem getting filled. I even bought back in and sold right back out of fear within the next couple hours, each time it executed instantly in the midst of the sqouzening. You will be fine"
2021-05-08 23:01:14,wallstreetbets,"I had some $.40 $10 GME calls that I bought first of last year that I sold when GME was at $165 for $155, they had a delta of .99 ( dollar for dollar ITM)  and sold immediately. Had some  $1.53 @ $16  GME sold for $277 instantly, delta of 1.

&#x200B;

The issue I ran into is that highest SP were PH/AH so I started exercising them first then selling PH. Squeeze lasted about a week with some peaks, very stressful, no sleep with PH/AH."
2021-05-08 22:42:28,wallstreetbets,"The premium should be the price of stock ($300) minus the strike price ($30). There may be a small addition due to extrinsic value. Being that deep in the money the extrinsic value is minimal though. 
The option premium would be close to $270. Each contract would be valued close to $27,000 ($270 x 100 shares). 
The bid/ask spread would be around $3 so the bid would be $268.50, the ask at $271.50. The midpoint at $270. This is just an approximation. Just read the option chain. All the information you need is there.
Nobody is going to screw you. When your ready to sell put a limit order at the bid. Somebody has indicated they‚Äôre willing to buy it at $268.50 so sell it to them. That‚Äôs such a huge profit don‚Äôt quibble over a few pennies. Just sell at the bid and get your tendies."
2021-05-09 11:59:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes at least during the January squeeze I Fomo‚Äôd into GME $115C at avg price of $10 per contract during the $60->$90 run on Monday and was able to sell at $30,000 per contract mid week. Same with amc which I was lucky to have $7Calls when the price was 5 at $0.50 or so per contract and ended up selling for about $10. 

However, that was January and you‚Äôre talking $500 for GME and $20 for amc. 

I asked the same question a bit ago and the responses were mixed. If GME is in the hundreds of thousands one person said they might sell your contracts for you ? But again, your contracts at least guarantee a ceiling per share for the person who wants to exercise them (perhaps to cover) so buying at market price to cover which could be ever increasing every minute vs buying the premium and exercising at $800 per share seems like the same thing. I‚Äôm of the opinion it should fill. 

Buying 100 shares vs buying a contract when the underlying is that high should be the same cost. So $$ wise it would make no difference to the buyer, but at least it guarantees 100 shares at a time. I also think sellers of contracts would have an incentive to sell vs straight shares because there is an expiration and they would fear drastic fluctuations of price if they wait too long. The $115 calls went from $1k -> $800-> $400 -> $5k -> $35k -> $15k by Friday Jan 29. And those are huge differences. 

The thing is the spread might be thousands or tens of thousands of dollars difference so it‚Äôll be really interesting to see if people are willing to wait for ask prices to fill or just put in the bid to guarantee the sale. 

I think buyers will purposefully put in lower bids to get a discount on calls and at astronomical prices sellers might just say fuck it I‚Äôm seeing 6 digits 7 digits per contract I‚Äôll live and let me take my profits.

If there are lots of halts and peaks and valleys people who hold contracts could fear a dip before expiration and try to exit earlier than a position with shares. But if you hold many, selling 1 or 2 contracts might just do you in with enough cash to exercise 2 others. 

If share buying is restricted then the only way to keep riding it up past expiration may be exercise and trust it goes much higher. This has just never happened before so I‚Äôm not sure there is too much precedent to look to.

Also know that that is the job of the market maker to fill the order if you set your price to the bid price. So the market is buying from you there doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be an individual buyer. Now if the market maker goes under and can‚Äôt fulfill the duties ..."
2021-05-09 05:45:29,wallstreetbets,You have no problem selling the options but you‚Äôll find another squeeze like that
2021-05-09 10:58:16,wallstreetbets,the market makers will buy back the contract they sold you at or slightly less than the price you expect. they‚Äôre (in theory) indifferent to the price movement of the underlying.
2021-05-09 12:33:37,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs rare that you would run into a negative premium situation no matter how deep you are in the money.  Worst case you will always get at least intrinsic value, as the MM on the other end will buy your call at that price to reduce their outstanding exposure.  Even if premium went negative , it wouldnt be more than a few cents as the MM would pick it up right away and then sell 100 shares against for a quick small profit.  The markets are too efficient.  The spreads will be ugly though, and it may be difficult to capture ANY premium from your contract.  At that point shouldn‚Äôt matter, you‚Äôve most likely more than exceeded any targeted profit targets"

Though trying to pinpoint who‚Äôll be the lowest bidder is close to impossible. So let‚Äôs focus on what we know for a fact. No matter what construction companies get the contracts, one thing remains. They‚Äôre gonna need a lot of supplies for the job. That‚Äôs where TEX the glorious Terex shines.


*this is my first dd report go easy on me lol*

*ps please let me have this one mods I‚Äôm trying here*"
2021-05-08 20:30:23,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the DD op. The stock has been doing phenomenal this month. Do you think the uptrend will continue?
2021-05-08 20:41:52,wallstreetbets,Positions?

2021-05-09 08:23:37,wallstreetbets,Terex machines suck. That said they probably still sell and equipment is crazy rn and I looking thru tickers I saw terex listed and figured it was a winner
2021-05-08 21:11:14,wallstreetbets,Niceeee. Any advice on a better format?
2021-05-09 00:17:42,wallstreetbets,This tard is joining the shrewdness come monday.
2021-05-08 21:15:53,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm predicting she‚Äôs a bull dozer. She has been for the last year going strong. She‚Äôs given no reason that she‚Äôs gonna pull a reversal. From what I see. I‚Äôd say right now is a great time to buy. This is a stock with minimal pullback. Right now she‚Äôs a perfect buy. 12 months later... I honestly can‚Äôt say. She‚Äôs got plenty of room for growth but corrections are about of the game. I believe we‚Äôll see a massive correction once construction slows down. If Biden sticks to his bill then it won‚Äôt be for awhile.

2021-05-08 22:41:27,wallstreetbets,"Lol.  It‚Äôs great equipment but it‚Äôs like John Deere, great when it works but expensive as hell to fix.  I used it everyday so your opinion  is moot. I‚Äôm not going to argue about equipment I use every day.  Some is owned and some is rented."
2021-05-09 08:25:16,wallstreetbets,And terex buckets sell before they are ever assembled...

2021-05-09 10:06:03,wallstreetbets,We got 3 Terex rts.   Exact same charts 2 are 70ton and one is a 75 ton.  Lol. They are being replaced with groves.
2021-05-09 11:53:38,wallstreetbets,"My company just put a ton of money on a new ram for the boom on the 80 ton. We're stuck with it for now. It's great as a test crane for new operators, if you can run that hunk of junk competently, the rest of the fleet is cake lol."

>""The company also has room for further expansion in areas such as apparel, B2B (business-to-business) and SaaS (Software as a service),"" he said.

Not sure if anyone has pointed this out already but she has a strategy lumped in with all of her other ETFs (shout-out to Israel Innovation?) listed on the ARK website --I highlighted this below.

I think she is expecting Tesla to continue to move *even more* into this space or release a product related to it so she doesn't mind buying when it seems too high for most. When you click on 'Learn More' you are taken to a statement saying why ARK is interested in the space.

A company with $6 trillion in assets and $30 billion a year in profit is unable to profit legally. All profits are swept to the government to pay for Obamacare and other things. Once the company becomes free of conservatorship they will be extremely profitable and a very attractive investment. The case was argued on December 9. The ruling is due in June.

2021-05-08 21:06:33,wallstreetbets,But eventually won‚Äôt the shorts have to cover their position in GME? Or has that deadline passed and they paid what they couldn‚Äôt cover from their own pocket? Is that why GME doesn‚Äôt go up anymore? Cause the shorts gave up?
2021-05-08 23:01:35,wallstreetbets,Currently short interests are borrowing and shorting 400000 shares a day in order to try and suppress the price of gme. Its a freakin powder keg waiting to blow
2021-05-09 05:51:55,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, it‚Äôs because people here don‚Äôt really fucking understand what covering is. There is no deadline, there is no special ‚Äúcovering‚Äù. It is literally just a stop loss.

So let me ask you, when you buy stock, I assume you use stop losses, right? (If not, I strongly advice you to). Say for example you buy at 25 dollars, think it will go up, and put a stop loss at 20 dollars in case in goes wrong. Perfect.

When you short a stock (and I do it as regularly as going long), you are literally doing the inverse of longing a stock. It‚Äôs literally the same (bar some very low interest fees, like 0.5%) as buying a stock thinking it will to go up. You short a stock because you think it will go down. 

So, if I would short the stock in the previous example, I would sell (short) and 25, and put a stop loss at 30 dollars. In this case, the stop loss is obviously higher because you BUY the stock (‚Äúcover it) when triggering the stop loss. 

So when I short GME, I usually put the stop loss at around 20 dollars due to its volatility, say it‚Äôs at 180, I short it, put the stop loss at 200, if it goes up there, i take my loss, if it goes down to 150, I take my 30 dollar win, etc.

I genuinely don‚Äôt understand why people think hedges haven‚Äôt ‚Äúcovered‚Äù. Covering is just your stop loss triggering and you buying the stock. It happens every day or every week, depending on if you daytrade or swing trade GME and it‚Äôs something immediate. There is no ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù, no nothing."
2021-05-09 11:08:59,wallstreetbets,Damn you learn something new everyday. Prolly the best way someone has explained this issue to me here. Thanks mate! Also then why is there not much volatility in the GME stock now? The shorts have covered and moved on and the bag holders aren‚Äôt selling?
2021-05-09 13:26:00,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs exactly it. The shorts covered at a HUGE loss in January due to the squeeze because from the moment the stop loss triggers until you get filled (seconds or minutes) the price can go up a TON, and since those stop orders are usually at market price (not limit), the price can go up like in the amount of dollars each minute, not cents. A chain reaction. That‚Äôs why squeezes are so dangerous for the shorts.

Obviously that happened, the shorts covered/bought (otherwise by definition the price wouldn‚Äôt have gone up), and continued to cover when it fell down to 40 dollars. A few had to take some losses again when it went up the 2nd time, but by then it wasn‚Äôt as much of a short squeeze, it was just crazy retail buying in a frenzy, pushing the price up hoping for another 400 spike, NOT shorts covering like the 1st time.

Right now there are some shorts still around simply because it is profitable (it swings from 180-150 which is a great spread), but basically that‚Äôs it: no volume because no ‚Äúapes‚Äù selling, and no price going up because most ‚Äúapes‚Äù aren‚Äôt buying as much anymore (and rightly so). Therefore a slowly decaying sideways movement."

Do you know about how this company has hyped up vaccines every single time a pandemic has rolled around, yet has not *once* ever released a vaccine?  Every time biotech companies hit the spotlight, INO gets a ton of attention, and yet has never done anything.

I agree with the sentiment that there's a HUGE opportunity to make money here.  But it's very important to point out that INO has a history of always letting down investors by never actually accomplishing anything.  Not once.  I have calls, but I'm not going all in.  I'm expecting a price spike upwards, but I'm not counting on anything from this company.  If they do have a product for once, great.  If not, I'm getting out.

I've read everything you can about this company, it's history,  it's less then average CEO(as it pertains to position) great scientist,  and it's a simple conclusion: This is future science when it comes to medicine/ pharmaceuticals. Without getting to conspiratorial,  look at timing and pauses reissued to questions about their proprietary device(not the actual vaccine). Then look at all of the mRNA( new technology)  vaccines that were fast tracked(when formerly were DOA at the FDA) and ask the question why.  

The good news is they have a pipeline of products in various phases,  vgx3100 is now p3 in China,  that work in tandem with their proprietary delivery devices,  that put these overvalued 1 trick ponies to shame( Moderna, Novavax, ocugen, etc) This is an obvious long term pipeline play,  which once 1 of their products gets through,  it will push the rest behind it due to safety tolerability,  storage/ transportation stability, actual cost to manufacture(much less), availability of products for actual vaccines/ medicines, full response(t cells) , The SynCon process(gives them the ability to write/rewrite sequence and variables, tweak coding as necessary) and literally about 5 other things that make them a Disruptive force.

No, of course not, biotech isn't quite that cut and dry.  But does that put them on a list of companies that we should be careful when investing in.  *Yes*.  That isn't a hard concept.

Show me 1 company in the BT/BP world that doesn't hop in the endemic pandemic opportunity, regardless of crossing the finish line.  I mean look at ocugen, they literally pivoted from what they actually do and jumped into a brand new field of medicine.  

I agree with careful speculation,  but jumping on the next hot topic while working on long term pet projects is exactly how biotechs work,  again with the hopes that 1 product comes to fruition. 

For example the jazz pharmaceutical/ gw pharmaceutical acquisition. Jazz was working on a product called epodilex since line 1992, it literally got approved 2 years ago and the company was acquired for 6 billion this year. It is a very similar situation,  first in class medicine, disruptive from typical treatment modalities,  and patented. 

All in saying is,  I don't believe INO has had anywhere near a fair shot at success when it comes to typical governed processes.  They were first to treat animals, first to test on humans 1st into phase 1,v then railroaded by the fda for 8 months over questions about a device that is being used on a different product that is already in p3 reveal 1. Sadly, my guess is their first product release is going to be outside of the US, and then that is what potential investors will say( yeah well its China, can't trust them,  or see never had a product release in the US yet)  when the chips are obviously stacked against them here"

There are obviously houses in the middle of bumfuck nowhere that you can buy by the beach for not too much money, but none of them are near jobs that would support paying the mortgage or the rest of that person's family lifestyle.

2021-05-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV will be a multi-bagger I'm a long term CLOV investor and do not believe the recent price action reflects a squeeze of any kind. More likely that wall street investors woke up to CLOV potential because of [this](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement) CMS update that announces CLOV participation in 10 US states in PY 2021. (This is my first reddit post so here goes)

Below is why I (a regular, retail investor) have held on to CLOV shares and warrants in my portfolio and why I believe getting in on this stock under $15 is a no brainer (disclaimer: I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and this is NOT investment advice, do your own DD before investing):

1. **Business Model:** Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurance company. [Sources of revenue for MA insurers](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-is-medicare-advantage-funded) include premiums and payments via CMS, most of which goes to hospitals and doctors. In MA, specially under plans offered by CLOV, premiums are negligible so for our purpose payments made by CMS (government) are the lifeblood of MA plans such as Clover. You may be wondering so what? Well, let‚Äôs put things in perspective. The US federal govt spent $1.2 Trillion on healthcare in 2019, $644 Billion of this went to Medicare of which $270B was spent on MA. All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members. The problem is, there are too many visits and hospitalizations (than are needed). What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation (pay doctors fixed fees per visit) and technology (Clover Assistant software with telehealth features) such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs. competition ([target outcome of Direct Contracting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/direct-contracting)) for HIGHER quality of care. Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending (more on this later) ‚Äì a WIN-WIN situation for insurer and the govt. This is why Clover‚Äôs business model is so fool proof!***TLDR:*** ***Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government, and its unique business model helps it gain market share***
2. **Competition:** Now let‚Äôs talk competition. Competitors such as Humana, United Health, CVS/Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending. They continued charging seniors on plan premiums, while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits. Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry. Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start (started in 2014, while other [insurers are just getting started with the innovation)](https://medcitynews.com/2021/02/mercy-humana-partner-to-expand-access-to-virtual-value-based-care/) and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i.e. achieve better results for its members, at a lower cost to CMS!! CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services, while targeting a LOWER TAM i.e. only Seniors right now. Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population.***TLDR: Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology.***
3. **Software:** Now the bit about software. This IS Clover‚Äôs secret ingredient. The development is led by an ex-Googler (Andrew Toy, President at Clover Health) to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization, and interactive UI. This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients. And they are giving it away for free!!! Why would a physician not use software that helped him/her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE. Imagine, Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over. When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space, Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i.e. additional sources of revenue.***TLDR: The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes.***
4. **Growth:** Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue, now let‚Äôs focus on others. 2) Current projections indicate 14% annual organic growth of MA population, this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60, as [promised](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/)in his campaign. Evergreen and ever-growing TAM 3) Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective. Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition, they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year. Now, if you remember the bit about software, Clover is in the best position to do this‚Ä¶as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors. This may sound like a risky bet, but it really isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶.60%+ of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software. Clover‚Äôs [long-term goal](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) is to get to a 70%+ rate. 4) End 2020, Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the [CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement).***TLDR: Growth in MA membership, direct contracting, geographic expansion, potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues.***
5. **Customers:** Let‚Äôs now put some light on the target demographic‚Ä¶seniors. Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans ($0 premiums, low/no co-pays) which are highly flexible (telehealth on Clover Assistant) to their needs. Why not? In addition, Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever-growing customer and incentivized partner base.
6. **Media:** The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance‚Ä¶except that there was a short-seller report and questions asked about the CEO. To his credit, Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money‚Ä¶now, when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors (the buy and hold kind) and when they realize how undervalued Clover is, they will likely pick up a good portion of the float, causing fewer and fewer shares to be available.
7. **Management:** If one reads through the exec incentive structure in [SPAC prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312520316032/d69158d424b3.htm#toc69158_24), they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock ‚Äì he does not receive a salary. More importantly, both CEO and President performance-based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of $30 for a 90-day period. Consider also, **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo (now part of TDOC, ARK fav) while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as board member and dem access. Recently they added the former director of Medicare - literally the only possible guy in the world that can get them what they need to continue growth for years to come.**
8. **Valuation:** SPAC merger docs value the company at $3.7B. Currently, because of the short seller report and the massive short-interest in the company, it is valued at \~$3B, which is \~4x 2021E sales. With projected revenues for 2021 of $835M (mid-point), and applying a 8x sales multiple, Clover‚Äôs valuation needs to be at least $6.7B+ market cap implying a $16+ PT. With expected 24%+ growth in 2021, and premium multiple for high growth companies (note that the float is only 25% of shares outstanding), I believe a $20-25 target is more in line with current valuations. When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next, this PT will need to be re-evaluated‚Ä¶upward. Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now, promising billions in 2025 and beyond‚Ä¶.it had sales of $670M in sales in 2020 and growing!! Consider also that the industry-leader in the telehealth space ‚Äì TDOC ‚Äì and a Cathie Wood & ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales. Similar multiple for CLOV implies a $33 PT.***TLDR: Whichever way you cut it, CLOV is very undervalued right now. Near term $25-30 PT and longer term has LMND-like potential in healthcare insurance***

I am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare. It deserves a lot more credit and people rooting for it to succeed.

CLOV YOLO

&#x200B;

**Edit 1:** as someone correctly pointed out below, heavy investors such as Vanguard, Blackrock and Bailee Gifford (Tesla mega bulls) all bought in at a mid $8 price point.

**Edit 2:** as requested below, there is also a bear case which simply means CLOV might take time to realize its full potential...which is different than saying it will go into the ground.   
**B1. Competition:** new competitors trying to enter the fast growing (but boring) MA market with an advanced tech platform ala Clover Assistant could impact growth rate (not growth). I think its highly unlikely but possible specially when Biden announces lowering the Medicare eligibility age. Smaller companies might want to get in on the gold rush. And legacy companies may want to invest heavily into revamping their business model (UNLIKELY - why? read [The Innovators Dilemma](https://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-audiobook/dp/B06Y4RRGVV/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw7diEBhB-EiwAskVi11l5HeOM_5nz4Z9EMKJHbGR9bSEs5YenWuxP8ykS-TP5AKJo1UhP1hoCiTkQAvD_BwE&hvadid=241921991729&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1018704&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=3239668408352121876&hvtargid=kwd-59432786&hydadcr=24632_10399692&keywords=the+innovators+dilemma&qid=1620501116&sr=8-1))  
**B2: Management:** management churn might impact the vision on which this company was founded. Vivek is a visionary - but the short report, legal challenges, DOJ inquiries, can impact his and his teams performance though the upcoming ER should lay to rest any such doubts.

2021-05-08 23:14:41,wallstreetbets,"Actual healthcare executive here.  Bearish case is that CLOV doesn't have anything special.  It is tiny compared to competitors.  This is a scale game.  The fixed costs are significant (you have to have a certain amount of infrastructure to contract with providers, pay claims, manage data, sell insurance) and at the scale they are operating it's going to be a bit before they get there.  

The Medicare Advantage Rates paid to clover are the same as the government pays for beneficiaries without coverage.  Clover has to have significantly better health outcomes to make a margin.  There's about $1K per month per member flowing in.  The costs are the medical care (which is mandated to be at least 80%) and the admin (selling costs, claims administration, customer service, etc.)  Selling runs about $75 a month.  all of that fancy technology has to be funded by the remaining $125 a month and somewhere you have to find some margin, have customer service, host websites etc.

I WISH that there were a magic pill, but frankly, I've met quite a few of the clover folks and wasn't impressed.  

If you're looking for an alternate, look into $ALHC.  Really solid management team. Their AI is the real deal (Did DD and toured the facility for a former employer).  Much better growth potential in my opinion."

2021-05-09 09:23:47,wallstreetbets,"ALHC made ~960M in sales 2020 and expected to make a $1B in 2021 ie 4% growth rate. Compare this to CLOV which made about $680M last year and on pace to make $840M this year ie 24%. ALHC does not have any of the tech that CLOV is building. As doctors get used to the Clover Assistant platform this will make it harder for so called competitors like ALHC to take share away from CLOV. Eventually, as I see it, they may need to license CLOV‚Äôs tech if they want to continue growing because CMS wants better outcomes at a lower cost of care - which is what CLOV will have DUE to its tech and ALHC will NOT have for LACK of any tech. We‚Äôll see. 

So the question is which company would you pay a premium for - a low growth, low tech company or one which is growing 5x faster and building a scalable tech platform to usher the antiquated Medicare system into the digital age. Your healthcare credentials are great to start off, but they fall flat if you prefer investing in a company that is doing nothing to improve the quality of care/outcomes vs one that is focusing on the long term to build something truly unique."

2021-05-09 10:11:36,wallstreetbets,"the tech you're speaking of isn't really unique.  ALHC has the same thing.  They call theirs AVA.  I've taken both for technologies for a ""test drive""  ALHC is more compelling, better designed.

This is a scale game, not a growth game.   It's also a smart growth game.  When you ""grow"" in this business, you actually take on a lot of members and providers who have to be integrated into your system.  Growing ""Fast"" is a good way for your star rating to drop.  A star rating below 4 will result in a 3.5% drop in top-line revenue for every member.   The STAR rating in medicare is based on patient adherence to certain programs (showing up for appointments, getting screenings etc.) This isn't a ""TECH"" play. it's a patient engagement and patient management play. 

There is NO chance that CMS will adopt CLOV technology as a standard for the 60 million beneficiaries.  Your hypothesis is not informed on how this industry works."
2021-05-09 10:29:05,wallstreetbets,"I never implied CMS will adopt Clovers technology. I specifically said insurers such as ALHC will eventually need to license CLOV tech WHEN it demonstrates (at scale) better outcomes at lower cost which is exactly what CMS wants. CLOV in fact show examples of this improvement in their investor presentation (see link in the DD) 

Patient engagement is hard(er) for this demographic, but yes, the one that engages them better will likely win. I say CLOV will better engage their members 9 times out of 10. You say ALHC. I say let‚Äôs wait and watch"

2021-05-09 14:07:50,wallstreetbets,"any of these players can show examples of this.  The problem is that they are each trying to build the best spaghetti sauce.  they are arguing over whether chunky or spicy is best.  If you go to the spaghetti sauce aisle of your local supermarket, you'll see where this will need to go.  CLOV may be best for a subset of the population, but at best it's a 10% share (maybe Polychronic non-frail seniors).   The problem is that those beneficiaries don't stay put.  They will move fron non-frail into frail categories.  you will have new beneficiaries moving in and new ones moving out.  Then you have a customer acquisition challenge that has to be faced and your ability to extract value is limited in time (3-5 years).  

There is no IP that CLOV is building that can't be built by anyone else.  Consider UNH Price/Sales is only 1.5.  Same industry as CLOV which has a 4.5 Price/Sales metric.  UNH has strategic partnerships and vendor relationships with dozens of companies doing what CLOV claims to do.  


If any of these strategic partners figures out something that works, UNH can inject capital and scale it.  UNH is very very good in this space.  Their pharmacy costs are among the lowest in the industry due to bulk buying.  You're obviously sold on CLOV.  If you'd like to know more about medicare advantage, I'm here to help."

CLOV will take risks (going against the establishment), improve outcomes and prove you wrong. Only a matter of time. 

While I'm at it disruptions occur precisely because of investors such as you who will NOT change or open up their minds to new technology and ways of doing things. And because of that, we will have your lunch and eat it too."

Otherwise, those margins are a thing of the past. Tax laws fuck dispensaries. You can actually make so much money that you owe more in taxes than you profited because of 1080e. A dispensary that buys in their own bud, concentrates, edibles, etc then they operate like any other retail business.  Double markup of wholesale to go for a 50% profit margin. That's it.. oh, except they can't deduct business expenses from their taxes and can fucked.

2021-05-09 08:36:34,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. Is there any info on what would be supposed to be the payout from the reveal be for fireeye?

I looked into it a bit there isn't much info other than the fact they just revealed it. 

They have released an [tool which is open-source](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fireeye-releases-tool-for-auditing-networks-for-techniques-used-by-solarwinds-hackers/)

There seemed to be only goodwill for fire and the payout could be nothing beyond audit fees. From $15 dollars to average $20 that is (assuming 100% capital outstanding or some poor fucking math) a billion-dollar spike. Not being an Alzheimer boomer value investor but that doesn't make sense at all.

The retailers who are holding are essentially bag holding turds and expecting another surprise audit discovery which may or may not ever happened.

2021-05-09 16:29:19,wallstreetbets,I'm green buy PLTR
2021-05-09 11:25:28,wallstreetbets,"Well, there is no direct payout for finding cybersec problems.  Not in the arena FireEye operates in anyway (there are bug bounty programs where you can make a few thousand bucks for finding and reporting security flaws, but that's not what they do).  But it is a very reasonable expectation that many large institutions and businesses will look to FireEye for cybersecurity services and consultation when there are these overt public examples of their competence.  If you're a bank or something like that and looking for cybersecurity insurance, you're going to have to show your insurance provider what you're doing that might reduce their likelihood of having to do big payouts.  Saying 'our systems get audited by FireEye' would probably make the insurer smile big and cut the rate.

A billion dollar bump isn't surprising to me, and might be a long-term expectation play, but it's not unreasonable.  Cybersecurity problems are only going to become more common, and companies have shown they are resisting all efforts that might get in front of this issue, so they're going to have to rely on people outside of their own companies to audit their systems, audit their software, consult on security matters, etc."

2021-05-09 11:57:12,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. I also want to throw my bearish case in our discussion.

1. What I have learned is that most cybersecurity firms are just *firms* with less than 50 employees and contractors. Even the most famous firms that usually expose stuff or get big corp or government contracts are small to mid size firms.

2. Consulting firms such as Accenture and big4 accounting firms are the ones doing a pivot in cybersecurity since last decade. So, they are getting a ton of business in IT audit. They have the money to finance a successful pivot.

Fireeye if they want to justify its valuation needs to reinvent itself radically. I don't know how to do a valuation on them. They have some products which seem to be more like advanced anti-virus. They have consultancy services. That's about it. 

The idea of being ""audited by FireEye"" needs a culture shift. As an accounting grad, I can tell you nobody gives a fuck about which business got audited by which firm since Enron. 

They have 3 thousand employees, the revenue growth isn't crazy, the product line is nothing out of the ordinary. On the other hand, they are hiring like crazy (which is one my favorite metrics for valuing a stock).

2021-05-09 16:00:07,wallstreetbets,I am too. I think it's a coiled spring. Will be curious to see how COIN share price reacts to earnings reports now that it is public. This company and Upstart (UPST) report this week. Last earnings report UPST share price shot up like 80%.

I get your point - they're a highly respected company with a proven track record and they're not going to waste millions of dollars on a security they don't see an upside for."

If you only bought stocks or leaps than you should be fine, cause the next earnings are prob going to be way better now that everyone is getting vaxxed, the people that were afraid to sell their house and move are all going to start putting their houses on the market, that will in turn bring down the ridiculous prices down from what they are now and the button is going to start getting pressed.

I personally know four different guys in three different states who have had exactly that happen to them.

Marriage is not an attractive proposition to men anymore, especially single men who have accrued a lot of wealth.

Women have been taught by pop culture, the media, Hollywood, and everything else around them that relationships should be adversarial, all men are secretly rapists, and the best thing you can do for yourself is to divorce your husband as soon as you get bored with him. Then, because all men are bastards, you are justified in running him through the wringer in divorce court and squeezing as much money as you can out of him.

I wish the above were a lie. I really do. But it's happening, and it's happening more often than ever before in history.

If you have a lot of assets, it's wise to get a prenup.

I'm a woman, by the way. Misogyny has nothing to do with this."

2021-05-08 22:11:50,wallstreetbets,"What I really was trying to say is... So on a average day, some stocks go up, some stocks go down on the massive short list. It's controllable to hedge funds if some run one day, and not all of them. If all the 30%+ shorted stocks run at the same time, they would have to increase their leverage to keep shorting hard to make them all go down. At a point a bank won't be lending them money because they are over extended on all positions. It's not a short attack it would be a bull attack. I believe that all the stocks are shorted by the same few hedge funds. If all the stocks, like GME, AMC, SOS, LOTZ, CLOV, BB, BBBY and so forth are squeezing at the same time, we could see a gamma squeeze of epic proportions."

2021-05-08 22:51:02,wallstreetbets,"Per the company's 2020 10-K:

&#x200B;

 **Senior Unsecured Notes:**

\- $225 million of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2024 

\-  $500 million of 5.000% Senior Notes due 2026 

 **Senior Secured Notes:**

 \- ‚Ç¨300 million of Euribor plus 4.875% Euro Floating Rate Notes due 2024 

\-  ‚Ç¨350 million of 5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes due 2024 

\-  $500 million of 7.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 

&#x200B;

""Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes ‚Äî Other Terms and Conditions The Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that will, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes and 2024 Senior Notes also require that, as a condition precedent to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted, our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as calculated on a pro forma basis, be greater than 2.00, as well as containing restrictions on our operations, including limitations on: (i) incurring additional indebtedness; (ii) paying dividends; (iii) distributions and stock repurchases; (iv) investments; (v) asset sales; (vi) entering into transactions with our affiliates; and (vii) mergers and consolidations.""

&#x200B;

As of December 2020, TEN was in compliance with all financial covenants. If you read the 10-K, you'll quickly understand what type of investment this is: an extremely distressed, deep value play. ""Debt"" is mentioned 168 times lol."
2021-05-08 23:21:30,wallstreetbets,"Here's the methodology:

&#x200B;

\- 2022 low EPS estimate of 3.92

\- Consensus 5-year EPS growth estimate of 4.42%

\- Applying a 0% growth rate thereafter

\- Applying a 9.2% WACC

&#x200B;

**Result: fair value of $51.24**

\- Applying a 50% margin of safety: $25.62

\- Applying a 40% margin of safety: $30.74

&#x200B;

Note that I used the 2022 low EPS estimate and assumed 0% growth after 5 years - about as risk-averse as you can get. To be extra conservative, I rounded the $25.62 and $30.74 down ($31 was a typo - post edited; I should have rounded down - thanks for catching). I believe a 40-50% margin of safety is appropriate for the stock of highly distressed companies."

One of the main drivers for RKT plunging after earnings was that their margin on mtg. loans dropped, a lot.  They also project it is going to further erode.  This will also hit UWMC and they are 100% focused on mtg.

2021-05-09 05:41:33,wallstreetbets,"Like, why the hell do you think these are especially good catalysts? What I mean is, every day tons of companies have catalysts, change CEOs, buy things, sell things... and yeah, they move a little. Like, 5 or 10 dollars at the most, maybe 20, sometimes even more if it‚Äôs a very low cap company (not like GME).

Why do people here GME is different? In January, there was a SHORT SQUEEZE. This only happens when a stock is heavily shorted (like then, not now, it‚Äôs not that shorted anymore due to hedges getting burned by it) and there is a HUGE surprise. And this must align in a way that cause a spike in very luttle time so that shorts don‚Äôt have time to cover.

GME has barely any volume now, moves sideways, is decently shorted (but not that much) and everybody is aware of its previous volatility. There is a 0% chance of any kind of insane surprise which would move it much, becase a short squeeze cannot happen again at the same scale.

Imagine the biggest catalyst which would be buying some other company etc, it would go up around 30 dollars at the most due to the shorts left covering (they have tight stop losses), and then crash back again due to sellers wanting to rack in profit.

There are THOUSANDS of stocks with good catalysts coming, etc... why the hell are people so fixated on a company which moves like a boomer and has barely any volume lmao ü§£"

2021-05-08 22:13:34,wallstreetbets,">First, completely disregard ""investor concerns about bond yields"" or ""fears about rate hikes"". Those are red herrings. For one, investors don't give a shit about bond yields (and Millennials/zoomers are too young to know this, but back when I first started angel investing near the turn of the century, bond yields were over 6%. Contrarians will point out multiples were a lot lower back then, but the two aren't handcuffed). 


I don't think it's neccesarily concern over bond yields, it is more the inflation that would cause action to adjust rates.  Beyond Berkshire commentary last week, I have friends and family that run businesses where they need to order a *very* broad array of items.  Prices are ramping *extremely* rapidly.  PLUS with Xiden handing out money like a drunk sailor in a whore-house there's no incentive to work.  That poultry shortage (which I knew about weeks ago from a friend who does large-scale ordering) is not from a supply chain thing...it's labor.  They can't find people interested in working 40 hours when they could make 80% of that for 0 hours.   I don't think we're heading in a very good direction right now; sometimes I wonder if we're in the opening stages of a dystopian future.  

I do agree about the yields being still incredibly low; I don't think the average person realizes how Reagan's policies set us up for the next 35+ years of equity run.  If the average person looked at yields in the early 80s they'd have a seizure.  Look at whatever your favorite index is, look at the run it's had since the early/mid 80s, and then try and figure out how much of that is from supression of rates.  70% 80%?  You have people in their 30s now that consider yields above 5% to be anathema, and I *think* that some of them are realizing they should have paid atttention to history, and that foreboding is beginning to seep into the market sentiment, no matter how brain-damaged that thinking is. 

Also, what investors *don't* care about bond yields?  I may have misinterpreted your statement, but as I am reading it, it is basically saying that investors don't care at all what a company's bonds are yielding, or if yields are moving up.  That would be dead-wrong, in my opinion.  That's directly impacting what your investment's cost of capital is going to be, hurdle rates on projects, liquidity (ability to issue at appropriate yields), unlevered cash flows (higher coupon payments on new debt when yields rise), and overall company fiscal health.   Or did you mean that a lot of equity investors are basically dumb-money proto-chimps that don't realize they *should* be paying attention to yields? In which case I agree."

&#x200B;

I mean that your average investor auto-manages their 401k and then picks their 5 favorite stocks in ETrad because they had the best commercials and doesn't do any more research than that. Or worse, they think they know what they're doing because they watch the screaming bald clown on CNBC 2 hours after market close.  In the words of the prophet House, ""people are idiots"". Most people couldn't overflow a thimble with the knowledge they possess about 99% of the topics one could possibly discuss. ""Investors"" aren't spooked by anything, and it's disingenuous to imply that they have anything to do with the price action of the larger markets.

&#x200B;

These days, it's all the machines. If the machines say the price goes up, it goes up. If the machine says the price goes down, it goes down. It's that simple. Attempts to nuance it or overcomplicate it distract from that simple truth. Right now, the machines are coded to say it ""mostly"" goes down....except for the ones that the machine's owners currently control, those can keep going up to make it look like the market is doing great. This is why the Russell 2000 has been getting asspounded for months now while the SPY keeps hitting ATH's in spite of the most retail-popular companies shitting the bed. The results of decades of consolidation, mergers, and runaway gaps in spending power between the generationally wealthy (and, begrudgingly, those of us who get ahold of the brass ring in spite of wealth's best efforts, thus joining them) and the schmucks who keep the machine going by making the sausage. Nobody is pulling enormous sums of money out of the markets because they're worried about bond yields or inflation (or if they are pulling money out of the markets, it's to put it in the Devil's Gold, which thus further proves it's all the machines because the Devil's Gold has been moving in tandem with the markets for a while now).

&#x200B;

Further, there is no labor shortage. That's a myth. I was talking about this with someone here in the last couple of days, but that whole narrative is a complete lie. In any capitalist system, you have supply and demand. If supply runs short but demand runs high, then capitalism demands that supply be enticed until it equals demand. I recently hired a new security architect for my firm (notable because we don't often hire as people rarely leave), and in my welcome lunch with him, he was telling me how refreshing it was to see someone offer him what he was worth. Turned out he had been getting literally dozens of offers from companies offering him 100-150K a year and a standard rote soft comp package under the guise that ""well, the economy is real tough right now"", when he was worth 3 times that. In a ridiculously in-demand field. Fortunately for him, he had the savings necessary to tell them all to fuck off until I came along. He was legitimately disgusted and insulted by his job search, as he should have been.

&#x200B;

You've got 2 sides to this story (and I need to re-iterate that, MOST OF THE TIME, I will side with capital, to the surprise of nobody): Capital claims that the problem is there's a labor shortage and the entitlements being handed out are the reason for it, so we need to pull out the stick and remove those entitlements to entice labor to take the 60 cents on the dollar capital is offering. Labor contends that the problem is that capital isn't offering a fair rate for labor's services.

&#x200B;

Now, historically, capital could just (literally, in some cases) starve labor out by simply refusing to budge on their wage offering until labor came crawling to capital to take what was being offered (or else found a bunch of illegal aliens with stolen social security numbers to work under the table if it was an unskilled position). No matter how long it took, even if it meant leaving a position unfilled for a year and forcing other conscripted members of labor to take up the slack. However, thanks to the money printing machine, labor now has a lifeline by which they don't have to take whatever subpar offer capital is offering them and they can tell capital to either raise their bid or go fuck themselves.

&#x200B;

And you know what? I'm here for it. I'm 100% in labor's camp this one time, even though I, as one of the not even 1%, but rather the point-numerous-zeros-then-1 percent, will be footing the lion's share of the bill for this social experiment. Wages haven't even kept up with even baseline inflation, let alone new ""we destroyed our economy to make sure we didn't have to spend 4 more years reading mean Tweets"" inflation. The problem isn't that the poultry factory (or whatever other company you want to insert here) can't find workers - it's that they can't find anybody willing to take their shitty minimum wage offer for a (literally) chickenshit job. Which means they need to up their compensation offer because right now demand says to do so in order to obtain supply, not that something needs to be taken away from the labor pool. The invisible hand has been broken for decades thanks to the consolidation of power in this country, and one of the unintentional benefits to all this stimmy is we seem to have bandaged it up and healed it some. Capital has nobody to blame but themselves for their inability to locate talent.

&#x200B;

Now, of course, since capital controls all the money and thus the media and the politicians, they will use everything in their power to push the narrative that the problem is enhanced unemployment benefits in the hopes they actually convince enough of the exact same idiots who don't know anything about anything else that it's true so as to remove that lifeline and force labor to come crawling to capital to suck its dick for 8 dollars. But I really hope it fails. Won't have any effect on me - I already pay every person in my company from the janitor to my personal ball washer to my CFO 15% above market rate with a generous soft comp package and an annual Christmas bonus of over $100,000 per employee. But I will laugh with glee as I watch the villagers start to torch the processing plant across the street (metaphorically). Hell, I'll even provide the lighter fluid, because bad faith capitalism is a plague upon our society."

He was legitimately disgusted and insulted by his job search, as he should have been.

I agree with pretty much everything before and after the quoted part above. In the quoted portion though, what you are describing *is* a labor shortage;  by definition, a labor shortage is when employers are not able to find enough qualified individuals for a position at a certain rate.  That rate *is* set by the employers.   That's the literal definition of a labor shortage.  Even if it's a shitty rate.   I'm not sure what industries you focus on (or if you cast a wide net);  for high-end food service I have a connection that runs a large-scale operation.  They pay more now than in 2019, and it's in a small suburb, the rate is good for low/medium skill labor.  They cannot find *anyone* qualified, in some cases they've been turned down cold because people *do* believe the government udder is going to continue to be there.   Is that the *entire* reason they can't find anyone? Absolutely not, but there is a labor shortage, and that is a contributing factor.  

The other factor here is the reorganizing of the economy.  Our economist did a write-up on this last week actually;  ~35% of service businesses that closed during the pandemic remain closed at this juncture, and I *believe* 80% of them are not expected to re-open.  That is going to leave a lot of unemployed capital *and* labor that is going to need to reorganize into new ventures.  That could take time.  There are permanent changes that have happened in our economy (orgs finally fucking realizing you don't need to cram everyone into a soulless office every day), lower mass transit, higher rates of home schooling, more order-in, less dine-out, etc.  There's plenty more.  As the economy reorganizes (and truly, continues to reorganize, since it began reorganizing over a year ago) businesses are going to need new skill-sets, or rather more individuals with certain skill-sets, more than are available right now.  We're at a labor force participation rate of ~[61.75% ](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate), down from a peak of ~63.4%.  Considering where we were, that rally is nuts, *especially* when you consider that above statistic about service businesses.  Consider this; at least *some* of the population has removed itself from the workforce due to stimulus/unemployment.   That could explain a lot of ~1.65% gap pre and post pandemic in participation rate.   *Pre*-Pandemic we would talk to management teams and almost every one said that the main issue they had was finding qualified labor.  Construction, machinery, transports, it was all the same story.   Now look at the start of this paragraph; the workers that are not participating right now are more likely to have come from those service businesses, and may not be qualified (at ANY rate of pay) for the industrial positions available.  

Having said all of that, I do agree that wages in this country for qualified working/middle-class folks are ridiculous.  I'm not talking about the people wanting 15 bucks for serving fries, that's supposed to be a job for teenagers, not someone trying to support a family.  I found [this](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FT_18.07.26_hourlyWage_adjusted.png) to be the most enlightening exhibit regarding wages.  In 55 years, Americans' buying power has only increased 10%.  However, it is worth noting that this was the case pre-Pandemic as well.  I just don't buy that suddenly people are saying ""no, I'm not taking 60 cents on the dollar"" especially coming out of the Pandemic.  Honestly, I think you're giving WAY too much credit to people here.  It's a depressing thought, but I mean that.  I worked as an industrial psychologist for several years, people just have NO clue how much they are actually worth.  They just think/know it's *more* than they make right now.  A few are disgruntled enough to take 60%-70% of what they made pre-pandemic, via stimulus, and sit on their asses.  I think the rest just aren't qualified for this reorganized economy, nor for many of the industrial jobs that were ramping up pre-pandemic.  I actually have a couple calls this week probing on this issue, and your post has definitely given me food for thought; I'm going to see where the analysts come down, perhaps they'll say my idea is completely off base, but I just don't see this being an issue of people suddenly refusing to work for sub-standard wages.

2021-05-09 13:00:36,wallstreetbets,"I own 85% of my company.  The other 15% I had carved off into a trust that distributes that share of annual profits to every employee equally. Wages /perf bonuses obviously need to be based on skill, but everyone contributes equally in their own way to the company's success so gets disbursed share equally.

It's funny, I had a woman about 6 years ago get a little San Francisco about the Christmas bonus because it was denominational and not everybody celebrated Christmas, so maybe I should change the name of it to something secular.  I told her if she wanted to opt out of the Christmas bonus, I would honor her request.

Suddenly Christmas wasn't such a problem for her and she was fine with the name.  Funny, that."
2021-05-09 12:34:42,wallstreetbets,I think that's part of the idea. Being paid properly typically increases performance
2021-05-09 14:59:28,wallstreetbets,"He definitely has the cleanest balls, I'd wager."
2021-05-09 13:19:40,wallstreetbets,"Still, that's mighty generous of you. And I would expect, were I in your bank, no complaining, and blindingly bright everything.  You're a good man."
2021-05-09 13:36:17,wallstreetbets,"Do you have remote workers? What is the best way to keep remote workers happy and productive (over a long period of time). I'm in college and I'm about to hire our 4th remote employee, but I have an inkling that some of my employees are slacking off. What do you make of that?"
2021-05-09 14:48:45,wallstreetbets,"That doesn't make me good.  I say it all the time:  It's just good business.  The best way to ensure they make me even more fabulously wealthy is to give them a piece of the pie.  Which means the  more money they make me, the more money they make for themselves.  

&#x200B;

Plus, I've had the math done and this actually SAVES me money.  Because I pay everybody above market rate and because I ensure their soft comp is so generous - basically, nobody ever leaves.  Because nobody leaves that means I don't have to spend to hire new talent.  Which means I also never have gaps in coverage or service.  Which also means that I never have to pay to ramp up a new person.  Which especially means I don't have to pay their salary for half a year (approximately, for the higher skilled positions) before they're even useful to me, because it's been determined that it takes about 6 months for a new hire to either learn the technical aspects and be productive or build out the contact network and relationships to be productive.

&#x200B;

If I just paid like everybody else, I'd be flipping 10 or 15 people a year, having FANG poaching people, etc.  That game is for suckers and chumps (i.e. everybody else)"
2021-05-09 14:55:14,wallstreetbets,"We have 3 offices, but nobody is ever required to be in any of them unless there's a client meet or signing that needs to happen.  One of my employees has temporarily relocated to Tahiti while she sits out the pandemic.

We've not experienced any trouble with remote workers.  As a matter of fact, we can demonstrably prove they've been more productive because they aren't spending 2.5 hours a day sitting in traffic.   We went to the ""work any time, any where, from any device"" philosophy 4 years ago, so we were well ahead of this curve.

&#x200B;

That said, our company is founded on the Berkshire principle of high trust.  My employees are empowered to set their own schedules and conduct their business with an absolute minimum of interference from management.  A luxury we can afford because we unapologetically have incredibly high standards for hiring based on everything except education, and make it abundantly clear that our business is business, not social distractions or activism, so when you're here, you're here to conduct business."
2021-05-08 22:03:31,wallstreetbets,"You may want to delete this, I don't particularly care, but it wouldn't be hard for someone else to triangulate who you are if you mention a second position your firm is in."
2021-05-09 17:56:43,wallstreetbets,"You pay your employees well. Do you give them a high base salary and high bonuses? Right now, I have market rate salary + a percentage of profits based on their performance (which is unheard of from where I am sourcing my labor from, they usually get just a flat rate salary). What would you say is the best way to motivate someone?"

Nonetheless, they are friends who have [collaborated in the past](https://web.archive.org/web/20101007114238/http://www.claremontconservative.com/2009_09_15_archive.html) according to conservative media, and interestingly the CMP was founded in 2013 when O'Keefe was still on [probation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-okeefe-avoids-jail-time/) for previous shenanigans. They're also linked through Lila Rose, who worked with O'Keefe towards the same ends under the organization 'Live Action,' and was Deleiden's mentor.

the only thing against that is that she's emotionally attached to it (family all grew up there) - also, even just condo prices in LA county are extremely high right now. so, she would maybe just rent somewhere, and retire pretty definitively with her 401k, Roth and social security...but she is definitely interested in re-buying a smaller place, just not at these prices, but no one is sure when/if they go back down eventually. Not sure how to advise her tbh."

Also, just because data doesnt fit your narrative, it doesn't mean its wrong.Is GME literally the first stock you're investing in?

2021-05-08 22:01:19,wallstreetbets,"you wrote that according to Bloomberg, retail only holds 11% of the float

that is absurd

I said Bloomberg not reliable (as per above, AND the SI)

you said Bloomberg is THE source...  that's when I mentioned SI, as it is a voluntary so CANNOT be counted on a factual, and YOU think made up numbers makes it THE source?

I don't care how much Bloomberg rapes investors, if they post inaccurate information, they have ZERO worth

Now I made a bit of money and picked up some shares Friday for dividends, but the action was a little slow to get into the position strong.

 Looking to get a little more skin in the game tomorrow, but will save most of my powder for dip on dividend payout.

Currently 100 shares, Looking at 10c at several expirations and may open some slightly OTM calendars to get more long exposure (warning; made it cheap to enter, but I had to buy back my 5/7 short legs after getting assigned on one)"

The company just ate shit because their vaccine didn't get picked up so it dumped a couple of weeks ago and the volume has been showing swingy signs and sometimes that's all it takes.

Basically, the OP said some stuff and the chart said some stuff and the price was right that I figure it was worth the gamble, for me. I don't need the shares to hit $14. I just need the contracts to be worth more than 7 cents."
2021-05-09 10:45:53,wallstreetbets,I mean it s called diversification I guess haha
2021-05-09 09:58:00,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I agree it does look like it has an effect. But these are small patient numbers. The median PFS with the present standard of care is a little longer than 6 months so showing 80% PFS in a few patients at 6 months isn‚Äôt mind blowing. 
Their data out to 18 months is more meaningful but again has very few patients (20 unmethylated  patients). It will probably trigger a larger controlled trial which will be more definitive. 
Having said that, I have zero idea of what it takes to move the price of a biotech stock. Maybe these small early trials are enough to drive speculation?"

I'm with you there.

Maybe we should stop voting for people who send out jobs to China and constantly tax the ever loving fuck out of us.

Maybe someone working at McDonald's shouldn't get paid more than a highly skilled worker. Maybe we should focus on the fact highly skilled workers haven't gotten increase in wages in 10 years, and jobs with 4 year degrees + 5years experience start out at $12/hr. Maybe we should look at the bigger problem than going after the click bait buzzwords that the TV tells you to scream about.

Fast food workers should not be paid $45/yr when a skilled engineer gets paid $50/yr. 

The discrepancy in pay is appropriate for those jobs and worker's.  Let's work on bumping up skilled workers pay before we start working on bumping the pay of people who can't hold the tomato on a burger when their ticket tells them to.

Let's get inflation under control and stop shipping our jobs to China. Let's get back to America being self sufficient. 

Let's stop importing unskilled workers by intentionally not securing our southern border and begging people to come here illegally for work. Let's stop keeping unskilled wages low because we pay illegal immigrants below minimum wage which suppresses wages and takes jobs away from unskilled Americans which leads them to poverty and govt assistance. 

Let's stop importing skilled foreign labor by abusing immigration loopholes so we can hire skilled foreign labor at much cheaper wages than American skilled labor. Let's give skilled American workers a job before we outsource their job to foreigners.

2021-05-09 16:21:37,wallstreetbets,"With all due respect, I think you're still massively missing the point.  The best hedge funds on wall street, with billions of dollars, hundreds of PhDs from MIT and Harvard, and virtually infinite information not available to you or me **STILL CANNOT BEAT THE S&P500** on average.  There are outliers, but the Warren Buffet bet proved that in the long term they will lose out o an index fund.

This wasn't just that you didn't have enough information or failed to consider ""future interest rates"".  It was purely a gamble, and you need to understand that.  Even all the hedge funds with all their near-infinite resources got this call wrong.  You are **NEVER** going to win in the long-term picking individual stocks.  It's just not going to happen.

WHat you're seeing here on WSB is a selection bias.  It's really tempting to see all these YOLOs print millions of dollars on a single bet or see DFV make $40+ million with Gamestop.  But these are all **OUTLIERS**.  THey're not even remotely representative.  Nobody here posts their losses equally to their winnings so you're only seeing half the picture.  And, I admit, that picture is seductive and very tempting.  But it's an illusion.  Until you have a significant amount of money saved up that you can risk *gambling*, you need to focus on investing.  And that means a boring old index fund that will grow over time, not rapidly.  Spend more time over at /r/investing or /r/personalfinance, not here.  This is for people who get their entertainment from gambling and seeing the occasional win, which is a massive outlier.

You do have great qualities.  ONe of these is that you're open-minded and willing to listen.  Please listen to the people here telling you to leave until you've accumulated some savings through a better job.  Learn better skills and get a hire wage.  The internet has near infinite resources and you can learn almost anything.  Want to learn how to code?  You can do it for free.  Want to learn how to become a social media marketer?  Google and Facebook have excellent free courses and certifications you can take to any business who needs your services.  Truck drivers are in such demand that if you have a clean record they will train you and put you out on the road making high 5 figures.  Focus on building valuable skills that will allow you to earn a living wage and actually make you valuable in the workforce.  No offense, but if you work minimum wage you are entirely replaceable at the drop of a hat.  Go find the skills you can learn that make you stand out that others don't have.  Then you can better bargain and increase your wages over time.  ONly then should you worry about investing.  The amount you have in the market, even before your losses, is meaningless and won't really increase enough to affect your life.  I'm sorry, but it's true.  

You seem like a great guy and the kind of person I would love to hang out with.  But focus on the fundamentals first.  In this case, it's a higher-paying job and better skills.  That should be your first, second, and third goals each day.  Nothing else."

2021-05-08 22:23:45,wallstreetbets, Just checked their price / sales ratio and its at a measely 1.5. Seems massively undervalued. Can you elaborate on why you jumped ship?
2021-05-09 10:00:17,wallstreetbets,True
2021-05-09 15:22:18,wallstreetbets,Still laughing about this 3 days later...
2021-05-09 18:44:27,wallstreetbets,"I personally don't. While I was optimistic that I'd called the actual bottom, there hasn't been much price movement since then and the downward shift just before close on Friday was reversed AH. Upcoming earnings should drive more volume into the stock and provide a potential catalyst for re-evaluation."
2021-05-09 19:45:57,wallstreetbets,I find myself agreeing with you. I was also shocked that the price has sunk this low. Thinking of picking up some c $5 6/18‚Äôs tomorrow morning if the premium doesn‚Äôt change much in pre.
2021-05-09 17:08:07,wallstreetbets,Tell those crooks to stop charging for trades.

2021-05-08 20:23:10,wallstreetbets,"Lol absolutely not. Say the market crashes a week before expiry, my leaps will be worth near zero and expire. Shares are shares and thus will have the opportunity to rise back. Which is why they are nothing alike. I know the point you‚Äôre making that leaps are not risky, but I disagree. All options significantly more risky, which is why they can can make you a ton or loose it all."
2021-05-09 08:34:25,wallstreetbets,"You don't keep LEAPS until 1 week before expiry. If the market has crashed that means all options are cheap, so you can roll your LEAPS another year out for basically free. 

I don't get why you feel so strongly arguing about a topic you keep showing you don't understand"
2021-05-09 09:46:48,wallstreetbets,"Go ahead and ask around tho ‚Äúare leaps the same thing as shares (in risk)?‚Äù And no one their fucking right mind w agree with you. Even in construct they are not the same thing, you have paid a premium for a contract that unless met does not the same thing or carry the same risk at all as shares. Goodluck you you.  Many ppl are fucked over by leaps as well. And go ahead and buy leaps instead of shares from now on everything since it‚Äôs pretty much the same thing for you. Later.

Also in the hypothetical scenario If the market crashes your leaps are worth pretty much nothing instantly , there is literally nothing to roll over. 

I‚Äôm just not going to let you make a dumb ass statement as ‚Äúleaps are the same as shares‚Äù and not say anything"
2021-05-08 21:03:39,wallstreetbets,This is pure.

2021-05-09 00:38:31,wallstreetbets,Why has SKLZ not been banned yet as well?
2021-05-09 00:40:43,wallstreetbets,How come SKLZ is in your screen name?

I thought $210 was transiently too high but good chance it'll be well above that in the future and a good chance it'll be around $100 if the swing and miss on everything post covid or lose IP battles over mRNA, LNPs etc."

2021-05-08 23:05:53,wallstreetbets,Stores are very nice. Most are fairly small but have a really atmosphere. On the premium side I would say.
2021-05-08 23:10:30,wallstreetbets,*have a really nice atmosphere

2021-05-09 10:26:38,wallstreetbets,"There are already a bunch of people ramping up mRNA vax production in China and presumably in India and by the time production is ready the trials will be over and efficacy will probably be no different. Starting early 2022 and ramping up quickly the business of making billions of doses of mRNA vaccines was always going to be very crowded and a race to the bottom on price given the muddy IP landscape. But BioNTech and Moderna and probably CureVac to a lesser extent are going to ink the vast majority of 2022/2023 contracts plus have government subsidizing production.

I hope this incentivizes BioNTech and Moderna to cut production deals with partners to license production/distribution and share manufacturing expertise. Given that already 3 firms are doing the same thing the trade secrets of manufacturing aren't that valuable. A risk you license to someone else and they screw it up so need to be very clear what the standards are for QC.

Duplicating supply chains and production in USA and EU and/or UK because of dumb protectionist contracts has to be a huge point of inefficiency. Moving beyond that will be forward thinking and good for everyone since the day when the world can produce enough mRNA vaccines to meet demand is closer than it seems."
