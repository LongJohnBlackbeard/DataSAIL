2021-04-23 19:48:50,wallstreetbets,Looking forward to a small dip Monday morning followed by a MOONSKI going into Thursday’s earnings
2021-04-23 19:54:56,wallstreetbets,Just hope it doesn't pull a OCGN. They were trading side by side today until OCGN absolutely tanked right back to where it was.

2021-04-23 19:05:54,wallstreetbets,"Imo AMC found a resistance level, the price is consolidating, and it’s getting extremely choppy.

Usually when this happens the price is about to POP so I’m just sitting here polishing these diamond hands.

LFG 🚀🚀🚀🚀"

2021-04-23 18:49:36,wallstreetbets,Let’s go!! 🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-23 18:46:14,wallstreetbets,I feel ya. Ran out of powder this morning buying a few more contracts. I was eyeing these contracts 3-4 days ago at $.60 and decided to hold off. Hindsight is a bitch.
2021-04-23 18:48:14,wallstreetbets,Was wondering that too until this week. I was down over $140k on this position at one point.
2021-04-23 18:44:33,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Been buying in since mid February and averaging down on the dips. I was significantly down as recent as Monday but nice to see MVIS is back on track!
2021-04-23 18:52:58,wallstreetbets,"Helps that I’m playing with house money at this point and have a crazy high risk tolerance. 

Yolod GME starting back in November... paid out decently. Took some profit and now just letting the good times roll and yoloing the rest."
2021-04-23 17:48:28,wallstreetbets,Damn I’m jelly of that average cost. I’m at 26.22 but fuck it we going 🚀🚀 soon anyway
2021-04-23 17:57:54,wallstreetbets,I’m on this too. 5/5 and it’s time to buy my wife’s boyfriend some new Jordans

2021-04-23 17:49:47,wallstreetbets,Lol I just bought 100 more
2021-04-23 17:49:57,wallstreetbets,"Why is RKT goong to the moon? Yes, the housing market is hot, but wouldn't that value already be priced into to stock?"
2021-04-23 19:53:24,wallstreetbets,Let's go!!  $RKT to the fucking moon boys! It's not in my 3 heaviest positions but I rly like the company as well as the idea behind their strategy! I think it's going up after earnings! Let's ride along 🚀
2021-04-23 17:58:49,wallstreetbets,"28 is here, dont worry, my wife is on ur side"
2021-04-23 18:04:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I dipped out to make a killing elsewhere so I like the sandpeople can return in greater numbers. Plus they have their meeting of the shareholders and I'm greedy, I want moar votes lol"
2021-04-23 18:01:33,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-23 17:51:48,wallstreetbets,"The value if rates increase has been baked in, im HIV positive that earnings are gonna blow away expectations. Housing is strong and rocket auto is growing very nicly"
2021-04-23 18:57:08,wallstreetbets,Where else would a RKT go!?
2021-04-23 18:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Plus its seriously a cash machine and the more they make the more they make lol seriously this to me is a golden goose, wallstreet fukked up buy way undervalued them, gives me a chance to buy cheep. I think wallstreet realised it when it acually ran up after ipo and have switched gears to trash it lol. Honestly to the un educated this does look like a stinker. I'll be laughing when this bitch is finally allowed to run to 150 lol"
2021-04-23 19:51:04,wallstreetbets,So fakin trou 😎
2021-04-23 19:32:48,wallstreetbets,MVIS ia worth the hype.. It has a high probability of  going to the moon indeed.
2021-04-23 17:36:50,wallstreetbets,"It's not gambling with MVIS, well researched stock. They have huge potential."
2021-04-23 17:36:36,wallstreetbets,Risk Level SAFE 🤔
2021-04-23 19:38:03,wallstreetbets,"I put most of my taxable account into MVIS(everything except BB and SOXL) I m thinking of doing a YOLO, but I know as soon as I do BB will jump past my avg. cost and then I’ll have to buy higher than I’m at now. I also threw my Roth into MVIS but I only recently opened it so I only had $500 in it. Regardless I’m pumped a wsb pick is working for me since I missed the boat on GME"
2021-04-23 19:50:51,wallstreetbets,MVIS doesn’t make lasers. Their IP is on scanning mems mirrors
2021-04-23 18:50:03,wallstreetbets,Ballzy move
2021-04-23 17:31:14,wallstreetbets,"Just head to a casino, you’ll do better at roulette"
2021-04-23 17:33:59,wallstreetbets,It's going tank come monday
2021-04-23 19:43:52,wallstreetbets,Blow it uppppp
2021-04-23 18:05:05,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I first jumped into $MVIS in January 2019 right before the Hololens rumors were starting. I started with ~6,500 and most of the gains in the regular account are from $MVIS. I believe in the technology and own and have used some of it myself. The only direction I see the stock going is: UP AND UP."
2021-04-23 18:01:04,wallstreetbets,Price target - $35 🌝
2021-04-23 19:03:19,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, this is the way"
2021-04-23 19:20:25,wallstreetbets,You post your DD somewhere? i'm new
2021-04-23 17:45:16,wallstreetbets,What is Safe?

2021-04-23 17:42:02,wallstreetbets,Up at 6:30 PT  and sell then buy back in at the dip. Just my plan. Love swinging with my MVIS
2021-04-23 19:01:50,wallstreetbets,"Got my balls tingling, going for leaps on this ho"
2021-04-23 18:30:12,wallstreetbets,Wayy more bud
2021-04-23 19:38:55,wallstreetbets,"Check MVIS subreddit, you will be impressed"
2021-04-23 18:39:43,wallstreetbets,"OP’s wife. If unsafe, it means OP’s wife will have a BF soon"
2021-04-23 17:34:19,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a Wendy’s restaurant.
2021-04-23 17:55:17,wallstreetbets,I'm only saying tank not because I am negative mvis though I do think there is no margin of safety for someone buying at this price but because this was a gamma squeeze that happened with the IV spiking to 200%. Come Monday if the IV drops that means dealers are going unwind hedges for otm calls depressing the price leading to a feedback loop of price dropping.
2021-04-23 18:31:09,wallstreetbets,What is your target ?
2021-04-23 19:39:51,wallstreetbets,I hope I can be her boyfriend this time. My girlfriends boyfriend won’t let me play anymore
2021-04-23 18:16:30,wallstreetbets,Wendy's menu is the roulette table. 😉
2021-04-23 19:04:09,wallstreetbets,I think it's very reasonable we see about $25 before the call on Thursday. If we get the good news on the Lidar sample then we'll it's only up from there.
2021-04-23 18:32:18,wallstreetbets,Very Short term yeah 35$ but with a buyout of 20b we could literally see 126$
2021-04-23 18:32:49,wallstreetbets,When is the buyout Though? July ?
2021-04-23 18:35:05,wallstreetbets,One can only guess but yeah very possible by July
2021-04-23 17:25:33,wallstreetbets,"At least you can make a killing selling covered calls.

\*looks at options chain\*

If I purchased shares instead, I would have something to show today at least."
2021-04-23 18:40:57,wallstreetbets,"Not all sunflowers have seeds, there are now known dwarf varieties developed for the distinct purpose of growing indoors. Whilst these cannot be harvested, they do enable people to grow them indoors without a high pollen factor, making it safer and more pleasant for those suffering hay fever.

######Extra fun fact!

Little Becka - Since these grow to just three feet tall, they are the perfect sunflower to choose if you only have a small amount of space to grow flowers. Their six-inch petals go from gold to crimson and back to gold again and their contrasting colors pack a mighty big punch. If you’d like an even smaller version, try the Sunny Smile, which is similar to Little Becka but grows only 12-15 inches tall, making it perfect to place on patios and in containers."
2021-04-23 19:04:10,wallstreetbets,Shieet that be nice
2021-04-23 19:36:24,wallstreetbets,Oh my.

2021-04-23 18:15:49,wallstreetbets,You have a $132 to spend on AMC and you'll go up up away. Not a financial advisor lol

2021-04-23 18:29:32,wallstreetbets,You have to turn it so the screen faces away from you. Then it goes the right direction when you look at the back of it.
2021-04-23 17:16:01,wallstreetbets,You gotta turn it clockwise. 🙄 Duh
2021-04-23 18:03:41,wallstreetbets,Turn it sideways

2021-04-23 17:19:20,wallstreetbets,I'm even them would frown at this. FD's are too retarded for them. I belong here unfortunately
2021-04-23 19:28:55,wallstreetbets,....yeah no. Only if I sold early on but if you're talking about inversing the plays that I made in the past month you'd also be out just as much (theta!)
2021-04-23 17:15:04,wallstreetbets,We believe in you!  I’m sure you can lose the rest of it by next week!
2021-04-23 18:12:09,wallstreetbets,He gets fucked. Deeply. With No Value.
2021-04-23 17:10:36,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck you're right.
2021-04-23 19:23:23,wallstreetbets,I literally rotated my phone to see if there was an angle where you came out ahead... you didn’t.
2021-04-23 18:15:31,wallstreetbets,That's divine evidence that you made an oopsie
2021-04-23 19:13:07,wallstreetbets,omg thats jkssss

2021-04-23 19:29:51,wallstreetbets,O I was talking about shorting it
2021-04-23 17:13:48,wallstreetbets,Lmao these 3 comments are like a summary of my thoughts over the past 15 seconds
2021-04-23 17:14:39,wallstreetbets,The oofest of ooves.
2021-04-23 19:44:39,wallstreetbets,You have to turn it right side down to make money
2021-04-23 18:25:58,wallstreetbets,No...clockwise.  WTF kinda chart are you looking at?
2021-04-23 19:31:12,wallstreetbets,"That's not inversing what I did though, and that would only work if you shorted on the peaks at 250+.

If you bought puts or shorted it since last week you'd still be out on theta and interest rates. Not massive gains."
2021-04-23 18:27:26,wallstreetbets,At the same direction that the stocks going 🤣
2021-04-23 19:31:46,wallstreetbets,O my misunderstanding
2021-04-23 18:32:04,wallstreetbets,Clockwise makes more sense.  The Moon is straight up.  Not up and then a sharp right.  It’s ok we all make mistakes.  I think you’re eating too many crayons.
2021-04-23 18:33:19,wallstreetbets,I didn’t graduate the third grade for nothing!!
2021-04-23 19:32:22,wallstreetbets,Dont do what i did though. Buy long dated ITM calls people

2021-04-23 18:04:49,wallstreetbets,This is EXACTLY the confirmation bias I need. Thank you for the colors and shapes. Me and my 11 shares are waiting for liftoff!
2021-04-23 18:26:01,wallstreetbets,So buy more GME ?
2021-04-23 18:40:04,wallstreetbets,If this thing went under $100 bucks god help my employee stock plan because it’s getting drained for one final spoonful of yolo-naise to go on top of my moon sandwich. 🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-04-23 17:33:29,wallstreetbets,Bullish! I like the crayons. I eat the stock.
2021-04-23 19:01:45,wallstreetbets,I do not understand a single thing you posted. 😂
2021-04-23 18:52:53,wallstreetbets,"If this stock goes back to $40-$50 the buying pressure would be absolute insanity.  If retail isn't already at 200-300% of the float, that would definitely put us there."
2021-04-23 19:01:26,wallstreetbets,"Can we also talking about the free float only being 20 some million shares? Reddit already owns 100%+ of the float.

If this breaks 400 again every short seller will receive a margin call sending this shit into the thousands."
2021-04-23 18:43:01,wallstreetbets,"yeah it's amazing how many apes, myself included, are excited about a drop to $40.  A few months back I woulda been scared reading that, now that shit has me thinking about selling my firstborn."
2021-04-23 19:45:19,wallstreetbets,96 shares here. Ready for take off
2021-04-23 18:07:25,wallstreetbets,Seems retarded enough
2021-04-23 17:57:35,wallstreetbets,I'm definitely retarded but should there be concern that the stock is at an exact number after almost every trading day? I see nothing like that in anything else I trade.
2021-04-23 18:25:58,wallstreetbets,"I have saved a post regarding the price drop and essentially yes, back to $40 and fuck me everyone and their mother would be buying I can’t imagine the frenzy. That in itself would be a catalyst let alone a single margin call.

Sorry editing this: their not there mother"
2021-04-23 19:22:57,wallstreetbets,Shares only retards if u buying options ur helping them to delay the margin call

2021-04-23 17:21:52,wallstreetbets,Can you read our horoscopes?!?!?
2021-04-23 17:49:56,wallstreetbets,"I found what looks like a repeating pattern.
http://imgur.com/a/RCkzzCv

After the 2 spikes there are 3  comparable phases.

I hope you appreciate the screen shot of paint.

(But seriously as this hype stock is not following any rules we have to study a new behaviour pattern)

This just jumped out at me.

I'm a crayon munching tourist trader so I do not seriously think this is TA

I saw a pattern and took a few rudimentary data points and the 2nd iteration is about 3 times bigger. In scale and time.

If this repeats then it boring for a month, a week long rise and fall then squeeze 3.0.
Not sure what catalyst line up with that (honestly I have no idea what I'm doing)

This doesn't deserve it's own post.

TLDR - 5 weeks from today."
2021-04-23 19:28:44,wallstreetbets,You can get a more accurate analysis if you hold your chart up to a photo of the rocky mointains.

2021-04-23 18:42:58,wallstreetbets,Nice astrology

2021-04-23 18:17:44,wallstreetbets,"It’s called move on, you missed it. It was months ago."
2021-04-23 17:34:27,wallstreetbets,"As per usual, no DD to be found. Seriously OP, up your game. At least the other clowns posting nonsense include way more meaningless text to pad it. Yours is so quick to skim over that you can't actually fool anyone. If it's long a lot of the suckers will fall for it and buy your GME stocks off you. Then they can create bullshit DD and sell to the next sucker."

2021-04-23 18:46:29,wallstreetbets,GME just doesnt move!!

2021-04-23 18:20:35,wallstreetbets,probably main reason why we havn't seen massive price drop yet. I believe 150$ is like the too expensive to yolo for some and not high enough to bleed out alot type of price point. if this goes back to 40$ id imagine alot of apes and appettes gonna be hoarding.
2021-04-23 19:44:21,wallstreetbets,I got in at 145.56 today and was thrilled b/c it got me two shares. Just keeps adding up.

\*ah shit here we go again\*"
2021-04-23 18:22:53,wallstreetbets,I would liquidate everything to buy GME at $40.
2021-04-23 19:45:49,wallstreetbets,I’ll average all the way down from 338 if it gets down that low again.
2021-04-23 19:28:26,wallstreetbets,"Like holy shit id almost be more excited to see $40 again than $480 right now. I would at least triple my position, probably more"

There is only one entity in the United States with the computing power and money that is able to effect that sort of market action.

It's not Ken Griffin.

It's the Federal Reserve, who has promised to do EVERYTHING in its power to protect the financial markets (i.e., keep them from crashing.)

The question becomes, how do you play the Fed for advantage when the Fed has a literal infinite amount of money to use to bolster its position?"

2021-04-23 18:45:40,wallstreetbets,"There are reports that there are fake proxy vote website's being posted on Reddit. You need to contact your broker or GameStop for the proper methodology. Not saying this is incorrect just saying what I've heard. I myself will be going through the proper channels.

Omega edit: I'm going to see if Fidelity will release my info and allow me to vote early as GameStop has requested in their messaging. I suggest everyone attempt the same. I will not edit this again.

Edit: Thanks all for the awards. I just spoke with Fidelity. For them you click on the account and trade menu once you login. Then click statements. Then look for proxy materials and click that. They have until a month before the vote/meeting to post it there. They will have your control number and instructions for proxy voting. They should send it out through email or snail mail also depending upon your preferences. Proxy vote through the instructions of your broker, nobody else. They are most likely using the proxy vote to prove that share ownership is greater than 100%. This will boost morale and make it very clear what to do with your shares. Also highly recommend everybody educate themselves on how short squeeze works as far as the time frame for institutions to cover their shorts and basically what happens. Thank you all and Godspeed"
2021-04-23 18:50:07,wallstreetbets,what's that? is it the share recall thing that was supposed to happen on 4/20? will they be counting the votes up until 6/9 or something?
2021-04-23 17:56:16,wallstreetbets,Those are still price reactions that create patterns based on the impact gme causes or is being caused by. So yes it can still very much be analyzed.

So, then ... the question becomes: Why hasn't that happened?

Imagine you have a gun, and you're pointing it at the market, and you're threatening to murder it, and nobody and nothing can prevent you from pulling the trigger - except money.

How much leverage would you have over the system?

Could you get anything your heart desires?

2021-04-23 18:37:09,wallstreetbets,I don’t think any CVSs around me are closing shop anytime soon. They will remain the pharmacy of choice for millions of Americans.

2021-04-23 16:23:16,wallstreetbets,You have a good view from there!

2021-04-23 17:26:21,wallstreetbets,Do they have recurring revenues?

2021-04-23 17:43:27,wallstreetbets,Hahaha
2021-04-23 19:38:27,wallstreetbets,"Spac or no, as we go more and more green their product will be in high demand."

2021-04-23 17:35:28,wallstreetbets,"So they may be selling windows better than others and that's all?

That can not be right? Maybe maintenance deals are bundled with sales for recurring payments?

Yeah backlogs are great

I'll buy some because I like your simplified DD (swamped with orders)

Edit: just bought some"
2021-04-23 17:51:41,wallstreetbets,For anyone interested in what the product is/dies: https://youtu.be/l4zOjHirQmY

Why not just buy the shares and wait for the HFs to fold?"
2021-04-23 17:25:45,wallstreetbets,"“Should we tell em?” That’s been my entertainment lately. Watching all the call options get crushed instead of buying shares. It’s like getting a picture of the finish line and staring at it, waiting for it to magically appear in real life, instead of putting in the leg work to actually get there. I’m sure DFV wrote a lot of the covered calls that idiots are buying and getting smoked on."

2021-04-23 16:51:38,wallstreetbets,"Because most apes are just greedy retards and not actually in it for any ‘movement’ or serious long term potential.  Otherwise everyone would just have their shares and shut up and wait happily like DFV 

The losses here went to the call seller and creates negative momentum, now apes are the short sellers to other apes and their just squeezing each other occasionally but still just fucking each other

Gme is just an ape fuck fest now IMO

But don’t get me wrong, I’m super stoked about like buying Halo 6 on the GameStop App and watching e-Sports or whatever"

2021-04-23 17:07:20,wallstreetbets,GME was fun while it lasted. Great short term play on the gamma squeeze but it has zero catalyst. MVIS has a shit ton of catalyst through the rest of the year. We cud literally gamma squeeze this until the company gets bought out. It has a strong base of OG’s and the tech is disruptive. THIS IS THE WAY!!

2021-04-23 17:47:53,wallstreetbets,Not sure what GME has to do with this post. Also not sure why you keep spamming the same thing several times over and over.

2021-04-23 16:13:42,wallstreetbets,Good job retard. You belong here.
2021-04-23 17:01:17,wallstreetbets,I legit don't understand how people can still buy calls on GME for targets like 250. This is beyond eating crayons..

I would advise you the same;)"
2021-04-23 18:19:24,wallstreetbets,A true retard would have lost everything - you only lost 100k - what about the other 150k?

2021-04-23 19:06:56,wallstreetbets,"A spread opened in one order and closed in one order will count as one day trade, but I'm assuming you're just buying them both individually.

Think of a spread or a complex options strategy as a single 'thing' as you would a call or a share.  You can open and close a condor and it counts as one, but if you start closing the legs individually, each individual order will count as a day trade."

2021-04-23 17:05:47,wallstreetbets,GME was fun while it lasted. Great short term play on the gamma squeeze but it has zero catalyst. MVIS has a shit ton of catalyst through the rest of the year. We cud literally gamma squeeze this until the company gets bought out. It has a strong base of OG’s and the tech is disruptive. THIS IS THE WAY!!

2021-04-23 17:58:59,wallstreetbets,Nah I never owned GME. Not bashing ur play man. I’m sure u made money. I’m all about money. But to me It has very small catalyst in comparison to the catalyst that will drop at MVIS. Disruptive lidar tech? Potential partnerships? Potential buyout??

2021-04-23 16:10:15,wallstreetbets,😦
2021-04-23 17:30:42,wallstreetbets,Fuck me tbh. I had a limit order of $10.01. Price hit $10.02. Fucker skyrocketed thereafter. There's been no dip to buy and it is taking too long for Fidelity to make my money available so I can buy in and average down later.
2021-04-23 18:21:15,wallstreetbets,Wow you didn’t even buy calls ?? Talk about limited exposure

2021-04-23 17:05:18,wallstreetbets,Haha apples and oranges dude. MVIS is coming up to it’s market value in the next month with industry leading tech roll out and potential acquisition.
2021-04-23 18:12:39,wallstreetbets,Been closing over 10 for a while.  Too many blue crayons?

2021-04-23 17:09:26,wallstreetbets,Nothing badass like you.. But $1000 at 17.20 and 300 when it went down to 16.78 this morning. Still holding.
2021-04-23 17:25:03,wallstreetbets,Just my guess based on prototypes being tested on starting this month and companies probably want to test the prototype for a few months before making an offer. So I figured by end of July they will be ready to move forward.
2021-04-23 16:19:30,wallstreetbets,Ya...I do
2021-04-23 17:05:32,wallstreetbets,Time will tell😉

2021-04-23 17:57:43,wallstreetbets,"The value is already in this stock, it doesn't need to squeeze but the shorts already being out of ammunition means they can't stop its rise"

This isn’t a battle against the hedge funds, we’re not going for some huge squeeze. There’s no evil conspiracy. It’s nothing like that. Take this chance to actually learn about the company instead of mindlessly following the crowd - less ape, more autism. 

MVIS is an absolute gem, but it’s for sure not guaranteed money and it’s been a bumpy ride so far. Do your DD. Good luck boys."

Come on DIS. I currently have two $177.50 calls on DIS expires May 7th. With the new deal they got with Sony to stream Spiderman and Disneyland re-opening next week on Friday, I believe DIS will stay above $184 and go up from there. DIS has been staying in the $183 range for two days. Goes up a little and then back down a little. I have faith in DIS with the re-opening of Disneyland. Don't bail on me DIS.

I am also taking another huge gamble. Bought two $27 calls on PLUG expires Jan. 21 2022. I believe PLUG can re-gain the momentum it had last year and climb back up to $60-$70. I hope  we have more green days since a lot of companies have been beating their earnings report"

Monthly Options closed out today, so that wild card is out of the picture.

AMD  has been building a base between $79 and $83 and it sure looks like the  path of least resistance is UP.  Seems like $88 is a reasonable target.

Sucks that your doggie is getting old man. it took me some time to get over my dog passing and a year later I still haven’t gotten another one. For me it was good to grieve and appreciate her impact on my life for a while and I’m close to ready for a new one. Missing the companionship is tough so I couldn’t blame you for getting another one.
2021-04-23 18:44:22,wallstreetbets,"I feel you.  We couldn't wait for the old one to pass before getting the new dog.  Now we will atleast have the puppy to mourn with, extra socialization for her, and the old dog has trained the new one to bark at the door rather than scratch it."

2021-04-23 18:27:33,wallstreetbets,Call the cops. Fuck those losers.
2021-04-23 17:32:27,wallstreetbets,"I bought it at 12, sold all at 17, went all in on ocgn and lost it all last hour.

You are fine."
2021-04-23 17:34:27,wallstreetbets,"""Oh no, I saw high percentage gains and didn't get overly greedy.""  Fuckin' shitbag."
2021-04-23 17:31:47,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you made profit."
2021-04-23 17:32:50,wallstreetbets,Hey man you still made profit off of it. You’ll get em next time
2021-04-23 17:31:32,wallstreetbets,Profit is profit
2021-04-23 17:34:54,wallstreetbets,"At least no one is selling, if big money doesnt want to get out, it s likely they re waiting for something"
2021-04-23 17:36:35,wallstreetbets,I should not have use “hype.” More like “interest”?
2021-04-23 17:32:17,wallstreetbets,Retail are buying way more than selling.  $150 is the floor hopefully
2021-04-23 19:41:56,wallstreetbets,"We've been fucked for a few decades, my man. It's only tolerable here if you're affluent enough to live away from the communists and homeless."
2021-04-23 19:38:28,wallstreetbets,🌍👨‍🚀🔫👨‍🚀

2021-04-23 16:51:28,wallstreetbets,Alanis would be proud.
2021-04-23 17:13:16,wallstreetbets,I ain't buying that 🤡💩 for $5k lol. Maybe if it were $500 a contract.
2021-04-23 17:15:23,wallstreetbets,A mainstream analyst on CNBC said COIN was an easy double.
2021-04-23 17:17:53,wallstreetbets,Sweet Jesus that’s a lot of bread to lay out
2021-04-23 17:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Bro this would literally have zero influence on MSFT. Its a 2B company, it doesnt move on shitty partnerships. MVIS however will pump by another 50% if anything shoudl be announced."
2021-04-23 17:26:53,wallstreetbets,"I have you tagged as ""Online educated"" so that should give you a few extra days to think this through."
2021-04-23 17:57:58,wallstreetbets,Very good indeed!

2021-04-23 18:59:59,wallstreetbets,"Shitting on us is one thing, but this next level bullshit!"
2021-04-23 19:22:07,wallstreetbets,I got two puts on MVIS and one on OCGN. Ocgu popping AH though 😥
2021-04-23 16:13:25,wallstreetbets,"I know this crazy to talk about any TA with GME...but if u zoom out a lil and peep that triangle, it definitely looks due for some movement. I can’t help but notice it"
2021-04-23 16:08:54,wallstreetbets,It’s lucky to be where it is honestly
2021-04-23 16:12:03,wallstreetbets,Literally only good catalysts. Shareholder meeting in june. New CEO. And then they can start revving up the transformation. Q1 online sales up 11% and they've barely started.
2021-04-23 19:58:42,wallstreetbets,"Nice karma farm, if ur were in mvis for 4 months tho, you would had been around for when it was $24.
So eat a dick you fuck."
2021-04-23 16:03:51,wallstreetbets,"More power to you but MVIS isn't done yet. Regardless, gonna be a wild week next week"
2021-04-23 16:03:49,wallstreetbets,I bought puts.

2021-04-23 18:56:09,wallstreetbets,The squeeze dilates time and distorts our frame of reference.
2021-04-23 18:56:52,wallstreetbets,"It's been pushed back to June.

In June it will be pushed to December. And so on and so forth until the apes slowly die off."
2021-04-23 19:09:14,wallstreetbets,That was Jan 22nd
2021-04-23 18:53:36,wallstreetbets,No it’s coming on may 3rd at 12:02
2021-04-23 18:53:49,wallstreetbets,Thought it was 3/19?
2021-04-23 16:06:01,wallstreetbets,had to put in that part about buying calls so you don't get shat on
2021-04-23 16:33:59,wallstreetbets,We have the single best one because it gives us big fucking waves.
2021-04-23 16:46:11,wallstreetbets,Sounds bullish
2021-04-23 16:57:04,wallstreetbets,Puts on that kid's happiness

2021-04-23 17:55:03,wallstreetbets,Well what did you expect? It’s not called “HIGH”
2021-04-23 18:04:06,wallstreetbets,haven’t looked at my wallet since the drop. hurts man
2021-04-23 18:25:02,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people are going to be saying that in the next year or two. Or even sooner seeing that some retards aren’t paying their mortgage, still."
2021-04-23 18:31:52,wallstreetbets,F in the chat for your future account
2021-04-23 18:43:02,wallstreetbets,Put more hours in at the dumpster
2021-04-23 19:21:44,wallstreetbets,I don’t think anyone can trade OTC after hours. Market cap & volume is too low would make it too easy to manipulate
2021-04-23 19:23:20,wallstreetbets,You can’t trade OTC stocks after hours...
2021-04-23 19:21:26,wallstreetbets,Can’t catch a seat on all the rockets. Your time and money would be better off spent looking for the next one before take off.
2021-04-23 19:27:54,wallstreetbets,4. Pltr being a cuck
2021-04-23 19:28:49,wallstreetbets,What’s the fourth thing?

2021-04-23 16:04:10,wallstreetbets,"For real, this is the first time I've felt good in months."
2021-04-23 17:20:43,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
2021-04-23 18:09:31,wallstreetbets,"This is the vaporware battery company, right?"
2021-04-23 18:40:43,wallstreetbets,"I’m sorry for your loss. I’ve always thought to myself, my first dog would want me to give as many other pups the best lives possible ❤️"
2021-04-23 16:24:40,wallstreetbets,"There are no women on the internet, just dudes who pretend to be women 😉"
2021-04-23 18:07:37,wallstreetbets,Surprised your grand scheme username hasn’t worked out in your favor
2021-04-23 18:00:42,wallstreetbets,Nice try dea.

2021-04-23 19:32:04,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna lie, was a bit worried earlier at the drop cause my calls were at loss of 35% after averaging up this morning. BUT this? FOOK DA BEARS, OCGNNN BABYYY 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-23 18:05:30,wallstreetbets,I agree. Calls 6 months out or so would be a great add here.
2021-04-23 18:10:14,wallstreetbets,Both
2021-04-23 17:12:30,wallstreetbets,MVIS and GME merger going to be 🔥 Lol
2021-04-23 16:26:48,wallstreetbets,Defo don’t marry her then
2021-04-23 17:49:55,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-04-23 18:21:24,wallstreetbets,SKLZ create mobile apps games like Bingo or word games (Scrabble like) that you can play with others and possibly win/earn money.
2021-04-23 19:05:14,wallstreetbets,"If she gets to fuck her other boyfriend, I get a pass for free OF accounts"
2021-04-23 19:31:32,wallstreetbets,Damn I should have bought more than 5 shares
2021-04-23 19:39:19,wallstreetbets,Never been. Hmmm interesting

2021-04-23 19:33:55,wallstreetbets,What can we do man? 8-9 million stupid fuckin people came at once. It was unbearable lmao
2021-04-23 19:51:07,wallstreetbets,"yea everything is a fuckin squeeze right now. I’ll keep hangin with them weirdos at r/stock, r/investing for a while"

2021-04-23 17:50:42,wallstreetbets,No one wants Chinese cars except Chinese consumers bc the government makes them buy it with incentives and probably other threats lmao
2021-04-23 19:54:17,wallstreetbets,At least someone is paying attention.
2021-04-23 19:02:39,wallstreetbets,I buy stolen drywall and eat it
2021-04-23 19:02:19,wallstreetbets,I buy stolen drywall to ship to China for shares of Uxin

2021-04-23 19:12:30,wallstreetbets,I can’t stand menthols on the other hand
2021-04-23 19:19:58,wallstreetbets,Weed makes me feel regarded
2021-04-23 19:50:26,wallstreetbets,The only thing I ever remember is the fatty I hook up with after drinking it
2021-04-23 17:32:36,wallstreetbets,I don't understand how anyone with a position in GME isn't just raking in the money on these right now. There have been some crazy prices on WAY OTM calls. People get too greedy and it ends up costing them money. I can't really feel bad for people that managed to lose money on a stock going up 1000%
2021-04-23 19:09:45,wallstreetbets,27th actually but hey
2021-04-23 16:37:56,wallstreetbets,"Fuck a wave, I dont surf. Flat water gang for life."
2021-04-23 17:05:20,wallstreetbets,I would cover-call the shit out of AMD if I had the balls to buy 100 shares of that turkey.
2021-04-23 17:21:14,wallstreetbets,"It only snows once a year, the rest of the time it's just blowing around."

2021-04-23 18:01:42,wallstreetbets,Lol was tryna give you food recco but drugs are good too
2021-04-23 18:23:13,wallstreetbets,so they're more of a casual game dev/multiplayer lobby for playing crossword against your granny
2021-04-23 19:03:11,wallstreetbets,You got the gift my man
2021-04-23 19:15:45,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-23 17:11:11,wallstreetbets,"Ditto, but instead I yolo'd into MVIS like a true WSB retard."
2021-04-23 17:43:51,wallstreetbets,True nuf
2021-04-23 18:24:55,wallstreetbets,"Got it but with money winnings (like a real-life bingo). Also, you can’t download the apps: you have to download the SKLZ app and then that apps has all the games. So the games never show up in the app stores."
2021-04-23 19:20:24,wallstreetbets,I love my flair in here that’s the only reason I come back lol
2021-04-23 15:59:48,wallstreetbets,Your graph looks a lot different then mine
2021-04-23 16:12:18,wallstreetbets,"TVs are low margin.

Edit: For those who see upside, they see advertising as the key. I want that to stay the fuck off my tv.  I'll invest in companies I hate if they have growth. Their long term growth is dependent on something no one wants."
2021-04-23 16:16:49,wallstreetbets,profit margin issues
2021-04-23 17:26:13,wallstreetbets,Because it's not worth trading
2021-04-23 16:01:46,wallstreetbets,Cause it’s up so much and it’s sunglasses
2021-04-23 16:13:59,wallstreetbets,Been yolo in pretty much anything I go into. Got in vizio on ipo day.
2021-04-23 16:09:11,wallstreetbets,"Currently trading for around $23.00 a share, not sure what Vizio your looking at."
2021-04-23 16:53:56,wallstreetbets,If only they made better products I would back it up. Their OS is garbage.
2021-04-23 17:21:02,wallstreetbets,Got out of vizio this morning and bought TRKA and TRKAW. Way more upside imo.
2021-04-23 15:57:39,wallstreetbets,Wow
2021-04-23 17:49:15,wallstreetbets,"If my TV ever downloads its own ads that shit will be returned as soon as humanly possible. I paid you already, fuck off

I don't use Hulu for the same reason. Free product + ads, paid product and no ads, or fuck off entirely"
2021-04-23 16:49:49,wallstreetbets,Nice! Now get out before reality of marginal profits in an overcrowded market hits 💨
2021-04-23 16:12:08,wallstreetbets,He is looking at his account.
2021-04-23 16:13:44,wallstreetbets,Ah.. makes sense now. Thx
2021-04-23 16:20:40,wallstreetbets,What is a broker?
2021-04-23 16:32:46,wallstreetbets,"Eh, I basically made my investment on the assumption that money was going in the trash anyway. Moon or crater, either way I'm in it all the way."
2021-04-23 16:10:07,wallstreetbets,Here for the long haul. $300 basis. Don't forget.
2021-04-23 18:25:21,wallstreetbets,"So, the SQUEEZE is monday? Just kidding!!!!!

But seriously, what is really going on... 

(not financial advice)"
2021-04-23 16:37:45,wallstreetbets,"""Not to be dramatic or anything but I would rather die than talk about GME anymore.""   


Thats not dramatic OR oxymoronic."
2021-04-23 17:45:19,wallstreetbets,Got it!   Fancy stock guru say buy more GME!    You rock sir.
2021-04-23 17:26:14,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino."
2021-04-23 16:19:45,wallstreetbets,Well this was a waste of time
2021-04-23 15:57:03,wallstreetbets,"i asked my Uncle who is a financial advisor and he said ""the whole world is turning homo"" [https://youtu.be/oJk5xN9I2uE](https://youtu.be/oJk5xN9I2uE) soooooo idk what to do with that"
2021-04-23 17:40:36,wallstreetbets,I think the mass majority could care less about if they get a vote as much as when it squeezes. And that information is already out. I read it on another post like 2 days ago. Your brokerage seems behind ?
2021-04-23 16:41:09,wallstreetbets,What is a conspiracy?
2021-04-23 17:42:58,wallstreetbets,What info came out today?
2021-04-23 19:36:01,wallstreetbets,Who's driving there to vote in person?
2021-04-23 16:21:07,wallstreetbets,"The news that it will go up to $420,420,420.69?"
2021-04-23 15:55:21,wallstreetbets,Another slow dying week for GME
2021-04-23 16:23:33,wallstreetbets,The cashier at Wendy’s.
2021-04-23 16:53:20,wallstreetbets,They help you go broke. Then they help you go broker.
2021-04-23 18:03:59,wallstreetbets,Broker is short for  boomer assistant
2021-04-23 16:23:41,wallstreetbets,I think it may be an app. On your phone.
2021-04-23 16:28:39,wallstreetbets,Well it means a bunch of different things depending on the context. I mean it in the sense that I am licensed to place trades and talk about how to trade with you. I love my job but I would be way happier at Wendy’s if I never had to answer another stupid GME conspiracy question
2021-04-23 18:01:03,wallstreetbets,"Someone you hire to break things, maybe?"
2021-04-23 16:33:50,wallstreetbets,That’s fine too
2021-04-23 19:00:40,wallstreetbets,"Maybe referencing the proxy vote that was just announced?

https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-126940/"
2021-04-23 18:13:00,wallstreetbets,I think is a ma’am
2021-04-23 18:59:21,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-23 16:29:36,wallstreetbets,Well people waste my time with these questions all day 💛
2021-04-23 16:51:05,wallstreetbets,Embrace the jorts.
2021-04-23 17:50:06,wallstreetbets,"Tell that to the 120+ clients I spoke with today alone who did not know at least one thing on this list and cussed me out for telling them they can’t vote. You might not be the problem but there is a mountain of misinformation out there that is costing everyday people like you money. I am tired of seeing people lose their life savings on a meme stock. All jokes aside people are suffering because they take this stuff seriously. Like whatever, I own GME, but I also know what I’m doing. I understand the risks and I’m not going to cry foul when I lose my money."
2021-04-23 17:53:40,wallstreetbets,Sorry that kind of went off topic. I’m just exhausted and emotionally drained. I don’t like seeing people lose their money.
2021-04-23 17:01:51,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, can't tell you"
2021-04-23 17:10:49,wallstreetbets,That's classified information
2021-04-23 17:21:36,wallstreetbets,I think its when you eat too many Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Little Debbie pies and cant poop
2021-04-23 19:10:06,wallstreetbets,"I do not have one clue, but we all know it's priced in."
2021-04-23 16:06:02,wallstreetbets,Meme stonks take the elevator up and the stairs down.
2021-04-23 16:10:01,wallstreetbets,I wonder how many here lost it all because of gme. Friends if you need to talk I'm here for you.
2021-04-23 16:43:43,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah... Dirty Randy, I know him"
2021-04-23 17:41:09,wallstreetbets,And then you go broke with age. Brokerage
2021-04-23 17:02:01,wallstreetbets,"You got a license to place trades and talk about stocks?

I just download an app."
2021-04-23 18:44:41,wallstreetbets,Can I ask you a question for free? What are your thoughts.. if you have any on VRT?
2021-04-23 19:36:44,wallstreetbets,You mean behind Wendy’s
2021-04-23 17:53:12,wallstreetbets,So it won’t squeeze is your professional opinion because there are more shares coming. Good to know. Thank you.
2021-04-23 18:15:29,wallstreetbets,No need to apologize I didn’t take it offensive but thank you. Look man it’s social media if you got a message say it. You mean well and it shows it’s a bit different then other assholes on here.
2021-04-23 18:36:32,wallstreetbets,i made 5k in a week then 5k a month later off it that paid for my daughters second birthday and room getting redone as well as lots of weed and a vacation started with 1000. a lot more people made money than lost it
2021-04-23 16:16:36,wallstreetbets,Cant lose if you don’t sell 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
2021-04-23 16:31:27,wallstreetbets,"All my crayons are still green, no idea what you mean."
2021-04-23 17:04:19,wallstreetbets,That's like taking the SAT after getting accepted to college.
2021-04-23 17:09:03,wallstreetbets,Yea but I get paid to do it 😉
2021-04-23 19:20:24,wallstreetbets,Lol I’m not that kind of broker. I don’t charge people. I don’t personally have it but it looks a little over weight to me. The float is promising and the average volume is nice. I don’t know your goals or risk level so I could not even begin to tell you what to do. Much like any stock I would just think through how much you are willing to lose on it and stick to the plan. Trailing stops are nice for that kind of thing.
2021-04-23 19:35:51,wallstreetbets,They said they owned GME. I’m gonna assume those are shares.
2021-04-23 18:25:39,wallstreetbets,Oh I know it’s social media. I’m not worried about the assholes. I just wanted to put this out there because if it helps at least one person then I did my job.
2021-04-23 18:59:37,wallstreetbets,Good for you. I have helped a lot of people deal with their accounts getting sent to collections because they made bets and lost. Just because you make money in the lottery does not mean everyone does
2021-04-23 16:23:28,wallstreetbets,Good luck friend I sincerely mean that.
2021-04-23 16:32:39,wallstreetbets,"Hey that's really good for you, theres a handful of people that bought in at $250 hope they triple that."
2021-04-23 17:11:35,wallstreetbets,No it’s like taking the bar after law school
2021-04-23 18:11:46,wallstreetbets,Does that mean you can give financial advice? 🤔
2021-04-23 17:36:05,wallstreetbets,Me too 😉😉
2021-04-23 19:25:53,wallstreetbets,"The only two brokerages where I ever lost money had teams hunting for stoplosses of customers. 

One time I caught them even creating the stoploss condition, taking the other side, and being flat a second later. They made me lose 4000 dollars so they could get 200 dollars with zero risk or effort.

Does this type of stuff happen at your brokerage too?"
2021-04-23 18:40:25,wallstreetbets,"I bought shares at 100, 120 270 and a shit ton on the way down. Foolish to think buy low sell high doesn't mean buying when the day is red"
2021-04-23 19:49:24,wallstreetbets,If I am understanding you correctly then no. Absolutely not. That is illegal. Was this in a self directed account or a managed account?

2021-04-23 17:29:20,wallstreetbets,WSB doesn't like AMC :(
2021-04-23 15:43:07,wallstreetbets,"If you are trying to lose money then you did it perfectly.  My rule of thumb is to limit buy at xx.80 when stocks are moving down and stop market sell at xx.20 when stocks are moving up between $5-$25.  A lot of people like to sell at round numbers, say $20 for example.  $19.80 weeds those sellers out.  Maybe, just maybe after those sellers are out, it will rebound.  Watch any chart and you will see that it is common.  Likewise the momentum on the upswing takes at $20 to $20.20.  Build a position with incremental buying. Buy bit by bit on weakness and sell bit by bit on strength.  Easier said than done but not if you are disciplined.  Remember, there is no crying in baseball, there is no emotion on trading."

2021-04-23 17:34:45,wallstreetbets,With only one slice of meat and six extra pieces of bacon. It is a baconator and not a hamburginator after all
2021-04-23 18:59:04,wallstreetbets,How did you know I ate this today? Baconator is soo good
2021-04-23 19:49:56,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a W....ait a minute?
2021-04-23 17:06:17,wallstreetbets,"Increasing short interest/super high short interest does not mean the stock is going to squeeze by itself. We need bullish buying pressure to kick start it, which we haven't really been getting at a steady level. 

Though the 30 - 40M volume we've been getting lately is nice, what we really need is to be back up at 100m shares level (see MVIS today)."
2021-04-23 17:06:41,wallstreetbets,"No worries he has a different opinion. I remember when people thought the gme squeeze was over when it went from $10 to $35.. then they thought it was over when it went from $35 to $70... Then I thought it was over when it went from $70 to $180... Then it hit 380.  These things can take months, I may be wrong but I like the way they chart is setting up.. should be fun the next few weeks"

2021-04-23 18:32:19,wallstreetbets,I'll lecture you bc you told me not too...  You could use any other brokerage for your degenerate gambling account and you choose RH!?  You really are a smooth brain!

2021-04-23 16:23:40,wallstreetbets,"I don't want Vanguard or Fidelity to know how dumb I am. E-trade knows about my gambling, but slightly less stupid moves. RH is for mega big brain moves that cause me to lose money every day."

2021-04-23 15:44:31,wallstreetbets,I’m stoked you figured this out. I’m just pointing out that its unnecessary with any other broker and people are constantly finding ways to work around RH’s shitty code.

2021-04-23 19:05:27,wallstreetbets,Maybe you’re right. What’s the worst that can happen 😉
2021-04-23 15:47:02,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but there's a huge influx of new retail investors using it. Many will fade out, some will move on to better brokers. Some will use it like I do, for a literal gambling broker. Either way, I want people to know how to exit when they choose."
2021-04-23 19:11:12,wallstreetbets,Worse that can happen is I lose the CASH I wagered. I'm perfectly ok with that in this account. It's for literal gambling. Lol
2021-04-23 15:59:23,wallstreetbets,"The only reason I still have a RH account is for those yolo 200-1000 options contracts that would otherwise cost you a fortune in fees elsewhere. If TD and interactive (my other brokers) would lower their options fees I would solely use those accounts. Thanks for posting this. I kind of figured this out before but didn’t know the exact time sequence (every 10, 5 etc) so I appreciate it."

2021-04-23 15:32:17,wallstreetbets,"I am hugely bullish on anyone with a clinical approach with Psychedelics right now. The research is fucking nuts. If this works half as good as it looks its going to be the only way that we do substance abuse and PTSD therapy, just for a start. The success rates by simply integrating psychedelic's into existing CBT treatment sessions is orders of magnitude more successful for this than anything else.

Pay attention to two companies that are working on dissolving oral strips for psilocybin. The use case for them is right in line with the current research in this space: Cybin and Revive Therapeutics. These are all OTC penny stocks so its high risk, but I thing there is real promise here."
2021-04-23 14:46:44,wallstreetbets,"Kevin O’Leary AND Mamma Cathie!!

2 things to be unlocked on Tuesday that could send us soaring:
1) institutions buying in that have minimum requirements to purchase and would not have previously bought on OTC/NEO. Nasdaq is a major exchange.  

2) open to Robinhood Users to now buy. We’ve seen this story."

2021-04-23 16:33:31,wallstreetbets,"This is not Cannabis 2.0. MindMed and the shroom industry are a biotech play. What matters is Intellectual Property. There is no money in just producing shrooms or lsd. Anyone can do it...like cannabis...that's why it crashed.

What is needed is something to monetize like: 1) Patent a molecule or drug derived from psilo or lsd. 2) FDA trials and approvals 3) Proprietary processes or drug delivery forms.

MindMed's 18-MC trial is a good example. Patent a molecule to replace Ibogaine. Start trials on drug addiction. Get FDA approval then go to the moon (insert rockets). Project Lucy uses lsd but is a proprietary process.

J&J makes a shit ton of money on their depression drug Spravato, which is esketamine...a patented ketamine derivative and put it in a nasal spray. Each dose is hundreds of $$ instead of generic ketamine pricing. That's what we want.

I guess my point is don't look at this as a cannabis play or worry about how hard it is to grow shrooms. Look at the shroom companies like pharmas, do your DD, and decide if you want to jump in.

Position: 5000 shares"

Mindmed has 3 Commercial programs 

1. Project Lucy: LSD-assisted therapy for treating anxiety. Good news on the horizon with opening of IND (Investigational New Drug) w/ FDA for this program.  When a company develops a new drug, it must get approval from the FDA to conduct a clinical trial on it. According to CEO in recent interview, he had a very positive discussion with FDA. Announcements about this will be released in the coming months.
2. Microdosing of LSD for treating adult ADHD
3. Project Layla: Ibogaine derivative, 18-MC, for treating addiction 

Many companies in this sector are only working on 1 drug. However, MIndmed = DIVERSIFICATION"

We believe that this is the future of mental health treatment.

I'm holding it because we are retiring in a couple of years and could use an investment that has the possibilities of an Amazon or Tesla for our old age.

2021-04-23 18:12:49,wallstreetbets,I grabbed about 180 shares out of the remnants of my sundial disaster purchase. I feel this is the way. A lot of talk lately about psilocybin treatments which I’ve personally experienced after some trauma in Afghanistan. It works. And this is for a good cause. 1. It helps properly treat ptsd as opposed to just numbing the mind with pharmaceuticals and 2. It’s not a fucking pharmaceutical. Fuck big pharma. Genuinely believe this stock is a good play but it’s a positive cause as well. Helps the karma. 🤷‍♂️

Further, as the share price returns to the previous $5.07 high and beyond, more funds and ETFs will begin to add.

Likely will continue to run up for a few days but eventually we will get over extended and sell off a bit. After NASDAQ we might go up more but then we have about 5 months of no news or trial results happening. We Will Sell Off. It happens to the best stocks. So watch the RSI, if its stay around 70 for a few days after NASDAQ, consider selling a bit to protect yourself. Dont be greedy. Get some powder for the days its dips and hold a core position for the drug trial results."

Question (just a dump ape here): Once MMED gets on the NASDAQ, would I counting buying the stock through the TSX or on the NASDAQ? Is the stock considered to be the same on both exchange platforms with two different tickers or will they be different?"

2021-04-23 19:44:41,wallstreetbets,I’ve noticed a lot of IPOs don’t show up on my broker until hours after the opening bell in the morning and by the time it’s available it’s already mooned. Doesn’t anyone know if there is a way to get access to these offerings at the time of opening bell ? Current broker is Schwab.

2021-04-23 19:39:22,wallstreetbets,"Seems like a great short term play.

But much of our country is still not willing to allow pot... how much longer til shrooms are legal?!

This seems like getting in to an IPO before it goes public. Likely short-term upside, but not much reason to hold after that. Look at where weed stocks went for the last many years prior to November 2020."
2021-04-23 16:13:35,wallstreetbets,Gme only thing going to the moon

Some of you plebs should look at a 1-year chart before blindly following.  Trading almost at its ATH.  OP says buy and volume goes through the fucking roof and you look at his history and first thing you see are comments asking for people to upvote his WSB posts that were getting deleted (3 today, in fact) about this play in a group specific for this stock (a penny stock a few months ago).

*EDIT: And no proof that he's still holding after his position went \~60%+ today.*"
2021-04-23 14:19:10,wallstreetbets,What is their business model? Sell mushrooms by telling it cures depression?
2021-04-23 14:57:00,wallstreetbets,"How will they make money? There is no money in selling shrooms. They are cheap, every idiot can grow them at home and nobody can do shrooms every day. 

Therapists can make money, when they use shrooms in therapy and really help their clients with it.

Mindmed could train those therapists and make money this way, but that seems like a grind and not really scalable. 

Maybe somebody can enlighten me."

Anything unique about business model or is this just the one we can own part of?"

2021-04-23 15:56:25,wallstreetbets,Threw in 2Gs too. Watched it dip 40% before waking up to a nice spike and some good news today!

I'm using degiro and it's under BGHM **here apparently on the Borse Frankfurt exchange. Hope it converts too.**"
2021-04-23 17:32:28,wallstreetbets,"No it’s obviously not gonna go easily to 10$ in the short term. Tbd if it does at some point when its trials and results come out. 
Positions : thousands of shares long."

2021-04-23 14:53:09,wallstreetbets,"Personally I think it will skyrocket once retail has easy access in Robinhood and other similar brokers. 

But i could be wrong. NASDAQ uplisting is a nudge, the real boom will happen once its trial results are declared. This is definitely a long term play."
2021-04-23 14:51:53,wallstreetbets,Keep going - Not even back to its ATH yet.
2021-04-23 16:49:57,wallstreetbets,"Today we saw a small dip just after open. We may see a similar dip on Monday. That's probably short sellers who think people over bought. They bought even more on Friday so I put a limit order in at 3.36.

If it does hit then I'll let this one go. Posting 2 hours before close after a 100% runup is some bullshit.

I should pass it up, but I've watched a lot of Joe Rogan and I'm convinced there's a lot of potential in psychedelics."

Unfortunately, if you do not already have money in one it’s unlikely you’ll be able to invest prior to uplisting. TDA allows OTC stocks, but when I bought mindmed a few months ago, they made me wait the full 5 business days for my deposit to clear before purchasing OTC stocks."
2021-04-23 14:59:18,wallstreetbets,Fidelity! There been dozens of posts suggesting people sign up with fidelity. What are you waiting for?

2021-04-23 14:56:45,wallstreetbets,Amen. Just looking at the TA itself this stock fundamentally is heading towards $10 in 1-2 months once it pushes its previous ATH.

Feels good to finally be in the green.

2021-04-23 15:56:42,wallstreetbets,"it's not that hard to grow mushrooms. let's just say it's easier to grow good mushrooms than good weed. the problem with weed is that states like CA (specifically california, fuck you newsom) got a mega hard-on for tax dollars and giving the nod to corporate elites, so they figured fuck you public, pay us 50% taxes and if you want in on this money train, $200k for a permit to produce/distribute.

so, there remains a \*thriving\* black market. as if it was difficult to get a medical card anyhow (and avoid the taxes), just pull up weedmaps and it's easy to find an ""illegal"" dispensary, no ID, no medical card, no taxes.

weed is cheaper, better, and more available than ever before, and CA can't do dick about it because progressivism."
2021-04-23 17:54:23,wallstreetbets,"Mushrooms are easy to grow, but the real value with MindMed is that they are basically developing methods of using psychedelics in a therapeutic setting. The drugs are not as valuable as how you use them, and that’s what they’re figuring out."

2021-04-23 16:50:45,wallstreetbets,It kind of already has and it has been pushed heavily for almost a year. I'd argue from a reasonable perspective it already has boomed but given how the market seems to be driven this days that probably doesn't really matter. I wary of this one though considering how out of range it is with any sane valuation right now. Would of be a great stock to get into last year now it looks like a trap.
2021-04-23 16:27:09,wallstreetbets,I can’t seem to purchase it on Fidelity
2021-04-23 17:18:17,wallstreetbets,I thought we had a week left before anything happened. I was going to throw down more today. So torn right now. Holding 472 shares @ $2.39
2021-04-23 18:18:04,wallstreetbets,Got 180 at $3.09. I feel good about this one. I think this company will really do good things.

2021-04-23 17:59:22,wallstreetbets,"It seems like that’s ketamine infusion, no?

From what I know, ketamine works well as an acute method to overcome depressive ruts, but over time loses effectiveness. 

I have no history of depression/anxiety/etc but i love using ketamine as well as psychedelics like LSD, and I’m pretty confident psychedelics are more promising in terms of curative effects on depression/anxiety. They allow you to soberly introspect on your thoughts, which you can’t really do with ketamine. 

Plus, mindmed is a biotech company in its R&D phase, you shouldn’t expect revenue for another 5+ years."

2021-04-23 15:23:32,wallstreetbets,Yes I bought with MMEDF. But I think it’s still restricted to some users since it’s considered a penny stock until the uplisting to NASDAQ and you need to get accredited investor. But again I’m not sure I’m not a financial advisor just try it on your own brokerage I was able to do so on TD with no problems.

2021-04-23 15:40:26,wallstreetbets,"It’s more about the medical use with these drugs. Therapy plays a huge role in the mental health care sector, that’s where the money will be made. Also MMED has a digital therapeutics team called „Albert“, this will help to make the treatment more individual.

But I think the delay in uplisting and a general hesitancy to invest in speculative, no-product companies drove it down to where it was yesterday. There has also been a good amount of short volume lately contributing to that. I agree that now is not the greatest time to buy MindMed, there is a possibility the effect of the uplisting is overblown. Who knows though, if the trials go well this will look like a discount in the future."

2021-04-23 18:04:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it’s ketamine infusion but that’s not their main long term goal.  They’re also in the R&D phase for the prodrug of mushrooms.  They have about 7 clinics right now spread throughout Europe, Canada, and the US.  They also recently received about 95m in capital to increase their clinics.  The long play is they build these clinics all over the world while using ketamine assisted therapy, putting them in a positive cash flow space while building their brand with consumers, and at the same time reinvesting that money back into R&D to develop further psychedelics.  These other companies have significant regulatory problems with getting psychs reclassified from their current schedules.  The boomers in congress won’t make that easy, whereas ketamine is already legal!  Love both the stocks, I just see fieldtrip as a really solid play with a better business model."

The SEC does not base fines on the firms value (they know its BS too), it's based on the severity of each violation using analysis of data to determine how much fraud occur.

Dude might have 300 million dollars in the Caymans, but it's really hard to launder that much back in.

Instead of engaging primarily in preferred securities and options trading that ensured the FF Fund’s liquidity, FRANZONE instead diverted more than 80% of FF Fund’s capital to high-risk, illiquid private investments, many of which were either worthless or significantly impaired.  FRANZONE also misappropriated FF Fund’s assets to fund his own personal business interests, including the purchase of an airplane hangar, and lied to investors about FF Fund’s performance and assets under management.

We're always going to need vaccines against coronaviruses and mutants moving forward. Ocugen will be BB's foothold on this continent. BB is a world leader in pharmaceuticals.

The flu season is now going to become the coronavirus season.

The US will be hitting this out of the park, meaning that even with a population reaching herd immunity/a majority of citizens vaccinated, they will choose to stockpile vaccines. Covaxin has a better shelf life and better storage conditions that the mRna vaccines.

This is conjecture, but couldn't Ocugen be tapped to help supply this part of the world with vaccines in the future? They won't just be a distributor but also a manufacturer.

To be clear, Bharat, after funding from the indian government is only capable of 700 m doses, or 350 vaccines. That accounts for 27% of the Indian population. 

So, they're gonna need help producing vaccines for the 1 B residents in NA and SA, especially where EUA has been authorized (Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, Paraguay, French Guinia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica). 

Also, the vaccine is not $10-20. Not sure where you're getting that from. It's 15-20, per Bharats press release!

2021-04-23 13:54:31,wallstreetbets,"I do think that is the one promising thing they have, the inactivated vaccine part.

However, Moderna and mRNA vaccines are easily modified to include spike proteins that covers new variants as well. I don't think the advantage is as big as it sounds.

People just see 70% efficacy vs 90%+ and will want the higher number.

I also don't see why the administation would EUA a vaccine without testing it on domestic soil. If anything goes wrong it is a PR nightmare. Why would they risk introducing a new vaccine if we are supplying more American vaccines than we have demand for at the moment?

Aren't Moderna/Pfizer testing on children in a p3 trial already? I believe Bharat is behind on this."

The MRNA vaccines are incredible tech, but the long term results are still unknown. There is a market for inactivated COVID vaccines and I believe Covaxin could be a big part of it, especially if it is seen as “safer” with kids."

2021-04-23 13:56:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm sitting on over 100% profits lol ""kiddo""

Just rubs me the wrong way when someone makes up stuff about adverse effects being swept under the rug - while providing no evidence whatsoever.
Also the assumption that 80% of adults will be vaccinated soon - the rate has been dropping every day bc there are a lot of people who are refusing to get vaccinated - and variants are still going around and will be around for a long time."
2021-04-23 14:00:02,wallstreetbets,"How about you provide a source for you claims that the Covaxin vaccine has adverse effects that the manufacturer was hiding

Shouldn't be too hard

And 80% at the rate we are going assumes a constant rate, yet we have been declining in daily vaccinations because there is a large group of individuals who refuse to take any vaccine.

And can the existing vaccines really be easily adjusted to also cover the variants? Why haven't they done so?

Also FDA does not require tests on US soil, so long as the proper procedures were followed."
2021-04-23 15:16:07,wallstreetbets,"The other guy brings up a good point, *do* you have a source for the adverse reactions claim? I'm not seeing anything on Google"
2021-04-23 13:58:59,wallstreetbets,You may be right about US market. But what you are missing is that hundreds of millions of doses are still needed in India Africa and South America.

2021-04-23 14:25:49,wallstreetbets,And you bought shares/calls right?  Dude is putting his money where his mouth is.
2021-04-23 15:00:16,wallstreetbets,"he posted DD about why he thinks itll go down, are you surprised that hes trading accordingly?"

2021-04-23 18:32:49,wallstreetbets,"Huh?

He literally posted a bearish thesis and shorted it."
2021-04-23 16:28:00,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, covered all of the shares. Booked 1.3k in profit. Not bad for a daytrade"
2021-04-23 14:01:22,wallstreetbets,"I'll dig it up for you tonight if I have time. There were reports in India of this months back when they were in the middle of p3 trials.

They were giving out the vaccine to people who could barely read, had no way to contact Bharat to follow up on any adverse events. There was even reports that these people had no idea they were even being vaccinated until after it was done. All so Bharat could reach the acceptable number of p3 entrants.

I did not include any of this my post because it is a serious allegation and I don't currently have the sources ready."
2021-04-23 14:08:24,wallstreetbets,"But they are more stringent about analyzing the data, EUA will likely take longer than if the study was domestic."
2021-04-23 15:23:44,wallstreetbets,"Quick and dirty google hit

[https://www.india.com/health/coronavirus-vaccine-side-effects-bharat-biotech-warns-people-against-taking-covaxin-if-4344145/](https://www.india.com/health/coronavirus-vaccine-side-effects-bharat-biotech-warns-people-against-taking-covaxin-if-4344145/)

The research I was doing before was much more in depth. I was looking into local Indian reporting sites that would be nearly impossible for me to track down at this point. There were several local journalists reporting very shoddy trial design. Don't believe me if you want, but I am not lying. Besides, every vaccine has adverse reaction events, thats not even a big part of my bear thesis. It really comes down to the EUA likelihood and lack of significant revenue they would have if they somehow got the EUA."
2021-04-23 14:09:55,wallstreetbets,Cant Bharat distribute to India directly?  What would they even need OCGN for there?
2021-04-23 14:04:27,wallstreetbets,"I just looked for your posts but all your DD and discussions have been deleted, all that’s left is YOLO and talking about shorts.  I’m what about OP’s analysis is incorrect?  Could you at least link your argument?"

2021-04-23 19:21:36,wallstreetbets,Is 11.30 higher than 10.09???
2021-04-23 18:36:59,wallstreetbets,"I typically read ""Why it is time to take *your* profits on OCGN"" as meaning what it's intended to convey. Had he meant to discuss why *he* chose to take a short position, I'd agree with you. Instead he chose to tell *you* what to do with *your* shares. 

But, it doesn't matter. Congratulations to him for making money. I personally would not entertain selling my shares though, as I know I'd be selling way too early."
2021-04-23 14:53:08,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I lose respect for your post, mate.

If you're gonna make a post like this, wait 'till you have all the sources, links etc *and then* post. Posting this when most will see it, move on, and never seen your supposed source updated into it...

It's disappointing."
2021-04-23 14:03:59,wallstreetbets,">I did not include any of this my post because it is a serious allegation and I don't currently have the sources ready. 

Then you should have left this gross misinformation out of your post, If you do not have any sources to pull from. You should know that. It just discredits you and any good points you might have made"
2021-04-23 15:28:23,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. On one hand, it does look a lot like they're trying to downplay it and blame it on other reasons. On the other hand, the list of disqualifying conditions looks pretty standard.

I guess it just comes down to whether they're telling the truth or not, which we won't know til later.

I appreciate the link!"
2021-04-23 14:09:08,wallstreetbets,I will rewrite it. WSB deleted because it was Ocugen and before that I didn’t have enough karma etc. lame. Will do at lunch.
2021-04-23 15:23:15,wallstreetbets,I bought a put 10 minutes before the crash thanks to your post. haha
2021-04-23 14:24:02,wallstreetbets,Cabron is right u idiot. I knew ages ago that their vaccine was unsafe. They cut corners and were not interested in whether it was safe or not. It was found to be unsafe and yet they hid this in their trial and data on purpose to make money.
2021-04-23 15:33:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah its tough to find anything juicier at the moment. I have feelings that the media is operating under strict rules to make sure no panic is stirred up.

This article alone is not enough though I agree"

2021-04-23 14:16:17,wallstreetbets,That would be awesome. I now have lil over 500 shares with average of 59-60$ (brought it down from 65$) been selling CC’s to cover losses. I should buy some leaps as well

It's not a catalyst when it's old news"
2021-04-23 15:37:50,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood is the worst piece of trash research tool in the world. Just use google instead. Paysafe has over 3,000 employees and is projected to do $1.5 billion revenue in 2021. Insanely undervalued in the sector at its current cap."
2021-04-23 14:19:06,wallstreetbets,I think its a good idea. I was swinging it for awhile aa a spac until my brain figured out just hold the damn thing forever. I want to sell ccs but I love this stock too much to risk losing any
2021-04-23 16:45:01,wallstreetbets,"Hey there, this is a strategy that I am considering trying out.  I’ve done calls and puts, but not covered calls.  How are you doing this with only 500 shares and making good money?  I figured you would need a few thousand shares, for this strategy, since it’s one contract per 100 shares.  I’m assuming that means you can only sell up to 5 contracts at a time(with your 500 shares), then sell 5 more when those expire.  

How far out are the contracts you are writing?  How often do you cash in?  How much do you make doing this?"
2021-04-23 15:14:32,wallstreetbets,There are problems in NY they are only allowing a few companies although draftkings has a nice chance to be one of them and they are going hamstring them to only allowing to provide a limited amount of betting games (like prop bets) so NY state allowing gambling won’t shoot draftkings to the moon and if other states copy NYs model it will hurt their overall outlook.
2021-04-23 13:59:08,wallstreetbets,Yes and dkng will be in Ny they are the biggest American online sports gambling company. NFL seasons should be good cause of new partbership
2021-04-23 18:35:03,wallstreetbets,"HA if you think it’s priced in at current valuation, you should short it 🤡"
2021-04-23 16:49:32,wallstreetbets,"I just thought it was funny, I don’t actually do research on robinhood."
2021-04-23 16:54:33,wallstreetbets,Yes 1 contract is 100 shares so I have the ability to sell 5 contracts a week. I usually sell weekly contracts just to collect the premium. Usually sell them at a strike price between 10-20% higher than the share price cause I don’t want my shares to get assigned
2021-04-23 19:00:57,wallstreetbets,"I had puts when it was at $35

I think it's trading right around fair value now. Certainly not worth shorting"
2021-04-23 17:10:29,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a decent strategy.  How much do you make per week doing this?  A few hundred dollars?
2021-04-23 17:58:43,wallstreetbets,Yes all depends I usually try n sell when stock is up so I get more premium
2021-04-23 13:19:15,wallstreetbets,Can't you be happy with gains without the moon speculation?
2021-04-23 13:33:47,wallstreetbets,"Ocugen is mooning because the CEO posted on LinkedIn last night that they're filing for EUA. 

Do some research. Covaxin performs the best against the variants, has had 100% efficacy against severe covid (and even hospitalization), and can be used as a booster for the other vaccines being used in the US. It will also be the cheapest available to us, and can be stored in a normal freezer.

People act like there aren't 50 different flu vaccines. And people act like we all get two shots and then we're done. Covid isn't going away. Vaccines aren't* going away. More will enter the market. Make money on it while you can.

2021-04-23 14:09:16,wallstreetbets,They don’t believe it will pass or they are capitalizing on the initial surge that happens. The price has been increasing and was not effected by the dip. Within 5 days it was below 6 and now it’s doubled. I’m thinking about shorting it for 100 shares if it reaches 13 again today. Will probably plunge to 7 next week.

The lock up is through the 30th which means they start selling the monday after no?

Yeah the wording is pretty clean about the week after.

`In November, 2020, members of our board of directors, executive officers, their affiliates and certain entities associated with those individuals voluntarily agreed to extend the lock-up provision on an aggregate of approximately 136,500,000 shares of our common stock, including vested stock options and warrants, through April 30, 2021.`"
2021-04-23 17:22:19,wallstreetbets,"Going to reverse WSB on this. NKLA is a smart play at $10 if you're willing to hold it for more than two years.

Cons: 

* They have no real tech
* Their ex-CEO/founder/largest shareholder is a complete scumbag
* They rolled a truck downhill a few year ago.

Pros:

* They're the only company in the US with working prototypes for hydrogen powered long haul trucks
* They have a deal to buy electricity for 2.5c kwh in Arizona to turn into fuel
* They're almost done constructing their massive factory, and some nerd films the construction every day on Youtube.
* This fueling station deal thing in the news now.

This stock has been beaten to shit and it's a SPAC still worth over $4B. Might sink lower, but I've thrown away $10k on dumber bets.

Also the hive mind hates NKLA. That's reason enough for me to buy some."

2021-04-23 14:16:55,wallstreetbets,"Zoom out its been sinking since they rolled a truck downhill.

Maybe it might be worth more then 0 a share because there is some equity, but it's worth less then the current share price. 

There is 1B of total assets, liabilities of 57m, so total stockholder equity of 991m according to recent 10k.

That works out to book value with 391m shares outstanding of ~ 2.38 per share.

Then there is potential dilution of :
32m shares issuable with an options strike price of $1.28 per share
24m issuable as stock compensation
4m under employee stock purchase plan
18m of restricted stock units (lock up)
760k under Warrants issued to spac investors with excise price of 11.50

In 2020 they lost $1.28 per share., assuming a similar loss in 2021 you are looking for book value of less then one share.

If you think they have no product and are a crappy company it should not trade above book.

Even if you think someday they will have revenue and a product and a legitimate business plan it is currently trading about 15x book value at the moment.

For reference Tesla according to yahoo (might be wrong, but after looking at nikola 10k I'm to lazy now to look at teslas) has a book value of 28.5 per share so at a share price of 728 is trading approximately 25x book value.

So comparatively nikola seems cheaper if they were a company with revenues and a legitimate product, but alas they do not even have a production plan and are now claiming to be a hydrogen company...


Side note about some funky accounting they booked a non-cash gain on their books due to the Warrants issued to spac investors because the Warrants lost value...

So I don't know what a fair share value would be I would think it should be less then 2$ a share.

Even if they never develop a product it does seem they have at least two years of cash to last them..."
2021-04-23 13:38:38,wallstreetbets,I mean...it suddenly rose didn't it

2021-04-23 14:18:36,wallstreetbets,Probably. It's gonna take awhile to sink this ship though.
2021-04-23 13:43:24,wallstreetbets,If the company has $840m in cash and $20m in debts it's going to take a long time for it to fail. If the stop is trading for $100m and has $800m still on the books in cash and there are no debt holders and the company is liquidated then the shareholders get the remaining money.
2021-04-23 17:55:28,wallstreetbets,"You'll want to look at the open interest and the bid/ask spread. If the price is moving down on the underlying (the stock), the option price will likely go down with it. I think times of stagnation would be the easiest to put a bid and have it fill, but usually you don't want to go lower than the average ask."
2021-04-23 13:48:59,wallstreetbets,doesn't mean the stock needs to go to zero....but it also rose like 20% the other day for no reason other than the Exxon mobile CEO had one sitting behind him on a call with CNBC.
2021-04-23 17:14:04,wallstreetbets,"It does have to go to zero to make money on puts. Just the strike price plus premium and commission.

2021-04-23 13:00:59,wallstreetbets,Look at LFMD for another drop. May not have been as silly
2021-04-23 14:26:36,wallstreetbets,"I’ve shared a similar positive view of this stock since the big drop last week. I have never traded options so I picked up commons last week. I’m optimistic that this stock will rebound, I just don’t know how long it will take. I got my shares at $30 and set a personal target of $40 for it which gets back to slightly above where it was when the CO-CEO news broke. I’ll be patient for a 30% gain....."
2021-04-23 14:44:40,wallstreetbets,Awesome disclaimer

2021-04-23 12:40:20,wallstreetbets,thank you very much for the complement !!! :)
2021-04-23 15:09:13,wallstreetbets,"LFMD is much more of a gradual decline. AHCO was an immediate drop. The thing keeping me out of AHCO is that it has been spiking up near $40 and dropping to $30 a few times. I cannot tell if the drop is an overreaction to the news and it will go back up, or if the drop is an overreaction to the news but there's not enough incentive to buy back in

I have bought a couple AHCO to force myself to watch the ticker and see what happens, but I'm not planning to invest heavily"
2021-04-23 17:59:42,wallstreetbets,"agree - there are many, many instances where drops/pops are warranted by fundamental shift/development/circumstance etc - however in this case considering the details, imo, the drop qualifies as silly..."
2021-04-23 14:54:34,wallstreetbets,right on my friend - i prefer mostly shares backed up by some options for silly drops as well but i didn't/don't have any free capital to go on shares so went the option route...

2021-04-23 15:10:41,wallstreetbets,"LFMD had a short report that really sent it spiraling after that gradual decline lol. I think it's extremely cheap given the growth.

AHCO is not well known, but the growth numbers its put out are insane. I've bought a good amount."
2021-04-23 18:00:25,wallstreetbets,"For LFMD? Yeah, I thought the short report was weak."

I’ve had to train him on the most basic of things anybody 14 years old would already know. He has zero self-confidence. He’s 58 working for $11 an hour and swears he’ll be a millionaire someday. He’s a personal trainer that still believes he’s in a 30 year old body. I’ve also never been able to emotionally connect with him and neither has my mom, ever.

2021-04-23 17:30:55,wallstreetbets,"That's a pathetic metric to measure on, considering the system has produced worldwide poverty. Food being thrown away solely because giving it to hungry people doesn't make you money is a dope system. Also don't get sick if you're poor, and even worse definitely don't be born with any conditions, you don't want to be indebted for the rest of your life right? 

God i love a system that crashes every 10-30 years, is entirely dependent on an outside body governing it because it cannot sustain itself, and leaves millions without food, water, clothing, and shelter when there is plenty enough for everyone. 10 empty houses per homeless person in America, yet we have a housing crisis.... 40% of all food produced in America is thrown away, yet people go hungry. More than enough medicine is produced yet people die every year from lack of access. Can't get a job that pays enough? Too bad! there's nothing we can do about it.

Can't live off your full time $9 an hour job? Capitalism rewards hard workers, you're just not trying! Look at Jeff Besos, he earned every penny of his wealth, and he most definitely put in as much hard work in one year as did 11.5 million full time employees combined! 

I don't find ""it's the best yet"" as very impressive. It's just chance it's the current system, all of the shit like social progress and innovation aren't from Capitalism, they have been happening for all of human history and will continue to long after the fall of this system"

2021-04-23 17:46:45,wallstreetbets,Nomadic hunter gatherers were tribal elders at 35. Infanticide was the only form of birth control. The common method of hunting involved chasing a large animal for miles over the course of days until it died of exhaustion. The most accessible form of nutrients was the marrow scavenged from the bones of animal carcasses inaccessible to the predator that took down the animal- thanks to the uniquely human ability to smash bones with rocks. And I'm still positive humans would have abandoned agriculture had they known it would lead to mainstream media.

Your issue is thinking that just because we have room for improvement means this isn’t the best time to be alive, but considering nobody knows the future, and we can look back in the past and see how much worse it was, how could you argue otherwise?"
2021-04-23 17:52:10,wallstreetbets,Okay right but you think people in Napoleon's time didn't have it worse than working 55 hours a week in an air conditioned building?

2021-04-23 19:08:52,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes that is true, but sometimes other people get overly defensive any time someone says something not positive about capitalism.

For the record, I am a big fan of capitalism. I think it is by far the least bad economic framework ever implemented. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have flaws, and wild swings in fortune based on dumb luck is one of them. This whole sub is basically a monument to that idea."
2021-04-23 18:07:54,wallstreetbets,"Nope, because that would imply we can’t progress and we’re at the peak of civilization, I never said that.  But as of now there is no better time to be alive and no better system to be using (unless you’re so smart you’ve been sitting on one this whole time and were just hiding it from us). That was the whole point of the conversation."
2021-04-23 17:34:05,wallstreetbets,"Well then your username makes a lot more sense, maybe when you’re grown up you’ll realize how pathetic that little rant sounded. And you still can’t name a better time to be alive."

We're still renting because student loans have hamstrung our entire ability to save money, but now we're just renters who hope to buy ""one day"" instead of renters who enjoy renting."
2021-04-23 19:15:22,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you the story of how I made +80k profit from my 147k house in 4 years...  Bought low with USDA loan and sold high when the market ramped up this year.  We sold for 235k.  Now I have the money to put down on a custom build that is exactly how my wife wants.  You may be ok with renting, but you're missing out on major tendies

Edit: I only did about ~5k worth of improvements, floors, bathroom, paint, etc.  I did everything myself so only paid for materials."

2021-04-23 19:53:07,wallstreetbets,"It's like people can't both accept that this is the best situation in human history for the most people, while also believing we can keep improving and not settle for this. For some reason people are conflating and suggesting you are saying that we shouldn't strive to improve further just because the current scenario isn't ideal but IS the best we've had, which you never once suggested or implied. Why is this such a difficult concept to understand? People keep invoking strawmen."

I'm personally thinking this will become one of the more trusted vaccines. That being said.. That is definitely informed somewhat by my hopes since I'm 2k+ shares in haha.   
They also have an agreement to take 45% of profits of all vaccine distributed in the US."

2021-04-23 16:01:30,wallstreetbets,"Calling this the most effective vaccine in the market is an overstatement. It's *perhaps* as effective as J&J and AstraZeneca. 

Reason to bet against Ocugen is that it may not get approved in the US just on efficacy data. The study sample was much smaller than the vaccines that have received emergency authorization.

Also, BBV152 (Covaxin, made by Bharat Biotech) is an inactivated virus based vaccine, a type that hasn't fared well against SARS-CoV-2. For reference It's the same basic technology as Sinovac which China claimed had a high success rate but in the real world has only ended up about as effective as the flu vaccine i.e. 50%. I would not bet on a deactivated virus vaccine. Maybe it turns out great, could be wrong here, but it's something I wouldn't YOLO on."
2021-04-23 12:08:20,wallstreetbets,"lol, do you really think the indian Bharat Biotech vaccine is the most effective vaccine in the market?

edit: am indian. my people are incredible at making generics. we are not at the forefront of developing cutting edge vaccines though."

2021-04-23 16:29:06,wallstreetbets,"It’s not the most effective vaccine on the market. It has a 100% efficacy against severe covid...same as Pfizer and moderna, both have 100% efficacy. OCGN has a 78.5% interim efficacy which is WORSE than Pfizer or moderna at a 93-95% efficacy. This vaccine is as good as J&J basically...which is fine, I would take if that’s all that were available but this is misleading saying it’s more effective. It’s not."

2021-04-23 18:41:03,wallstreetbets,Gotta love after the nice price spike they come out and offer new shares.  Fucking management.  🤦‍♂️.  No shares but did sell a few puts.  Premiums nice on those.
2021-04-23 13:37:20,wallstreetbets,"Yup! I am trusting my gut on this one, like I should’ve on others I sold early to get a quick buck (sold SAVA <$5 because I was tired of holding, that was a bummer to see it run). Trying to not have regerts again haha"

2021-04-23 14:46:15,wallstreetbets,"What a great fuckin joke haha. I got in originally at $5 in February, wish I could’ve found out about it earlier but I was fixated on GME at the time"
2021-04-23 13:41:05,wallstreetbets,"I don’t see it dipping long term with potential EUA on the way. I originally bought into this one anyways for their primary business before there was even talks of a vaccine partnership, so staying in for awhile still"

2021-04-23 11:51:53,wallstreetbets,No kidding! Saw that and cringed hard

2021-04-23 12:24:19,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-04-23 14:49:48,wallstreetbets,Got a sell for 500 at $225 because it’d be more than enough for a 30% down payment on a new house and hoping (keyword) this one has a fomo run whenever EUA happens. Trying to make sure I can capitalize even though I’ll be at work 😂
2021-04-23 19:30:32,wallstreetbets,Stock will be above $15 by end of next week.offering at $10is now the bottom.
2021-04-23 13:28:50,wallstreetbets,Can high convince me to buy too please? What good news?
2021-04-23 14:05:31,wallstreetbets,Sell half so you ride for free
2021-04-23 14:21:22,wallstreetbets,why? I'll gladly lose my 1000$ investment to risk  not cashing out of the next novavax
2021-04-23 16:39:12,wallstreetbets,EUA...  but how the hell is it going to take market share from BP?
2021-04-23 19:43:21,wallstreetbets,Bc you saw a lot of people are Reddit talk about it randomly so you threw money at it not realizing by the time you heard it already peaked
2021-04-23 15:43:12,wallstreetbets,I guess i wont quit my dayjob anytime soon😄
2021-04-23 15:44:10,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit, this sub is filled with actual retards."
2021-04-23 12:55:23,wallstreetbets,You would have to make over a mil for it to matter. It also doesn't matter when you sell because this would be claimed on next year's taxes. Selling now wouldn't avoid the new tax.
2021-04-23 12:01:47,wallstreetbets,It encourages people to sell stocks in order to keep the prices manageable. It’s the total opposite of Powell method which focuses on holding the stocks
2021-04-23 12:04:20,wallstreetbets,capital gains tax potentially raising from 20% to right under 40% this really won't matter to you unless you're making more than 1 mil a year. It's basically a tax for the rich which won't really matter anyway since the super can create offshore shell companies to avoid it. What they need to do is raise dividend tax.
2021-04-23 12:07:27,wallstreetbets,There are long term (held > 1 year) and short term ( held < 1 year) gains taxes. Short term are taxed at standard tax bracket levels (basically add gains to your total income) and long term are taxed at discounted rates (currently 0% bottom two brackets/15% middle brackets/20% top two brackets) that are based on your tax bracket rates. Biden’s wants a hike to 39.6% for the high end of capital gains taxes
2021-04-23 13:19:04,wallstreetbets,"Of course it’s a joke. To pay taxes and claim to be a top earner is a honor not a burden

Capital taxes are for people who are the shit and the gov Is like hold up. You making us look bad pay up or sale"

2021-04-23 12:40:19,wallstreetbets,Then explain market sell offs? This is just basic common sense.
2021-04-23 16:33:35,wallstreetbets,"This, lol."
2021-04-23 15:06:25,wallstreetbets,Sell off is due to the narrative hedge funds push while they short stocks - the tax news isn't new Biden has been saying it through his entire campaign. They are just now using the story to cause sell offs.
2021-04-23 13:06:58,wallstreetbets,Because the rich are whiny babies.

2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HYLN Part 3: Basket SPACs and Short Reports 'Sup nerds. Chances are, some of y'all are pretty damn mad at me. Three days ago, HYLN was down like 17% since my first thread, and I know some of you dummies sold at the very bottom. I know this because some of you even told me as much. Some other of you kind, non-invested souls even messaged to check in on me, gloating and feigning concern that my stock pick was down so much. Bless your malevolent little hearts. I bought [MORE](https://i.ibb.co/LCFpn8r/Hyliion-Buyliion.png), you thundercunts.

Well, HYLN is now only down around *10%* since my initial thread, which still places me among the top stock pickers of WSB, so fuck you. Fact is, I **expected** HYLN to continue trading down a bit from my initial post. I even said to expect more downward pressure in the short term in my previous thread:

>**HYLN is still being manipulated. Wouldn't be surprised if it  continues trending down for the short-term as it shakes out weak paper  hands. Think about why. I'm holding this stock until something  FUNDAMENTAL changes about the company. Day-to-day red and green doesn't  change my thesis. Paper hands get shook.**  
>  
>[Source](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrjjyo/hyln_pt_2_a_fair_warning/)

HYLN being in the red for no reason doesn't bother me. I'll explain *why*, but first I need you ass-scratch-and-sniffers to understand a term:

# Baskets, or why buying a winning company isn't always a free lunch

[**Basket**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basket.asp) \-- A basket isn't just a prop you wear on your head to make your other 70 IQ friends laugh milk out of their noses. A basket is a collection of similar stocks that tend to trade together. Conspiracy theorist GMEanons used to perceive GME/AMC/BB all trading together to be ""evidence of market manipulation"" when in reality it was just algos buying and selling a collection of similar stocks because that's what algos do. ""They aren't similar though!"" said the GMEanons. They *were* \-- they were hyped up to massive valuations by a huge collection of retarded retail traders -- the vast majority of whom had no idea what they were doing, as evidenced by their not knowing what a fucking *basket* is if it's not made of wicker.

So *why* am I talking about baskets of the non-pic-a-nic kind, Booboo?

[This is why.](https://i.ibb.co/wh1GFXW/basket-SPACs.png) Look at those stocks. I even put them into a fucking basket so you could maybe hopefully understand it a bit easier. Take a minute to look at the picture and think about this question: What do they all have in common?

...

Yes, they're all in a basket, we already covered that. Anything else?... Nothing? Jesus Christ, your pattern recognition skills must place you in the sub-70 IQ category, fucking hell...

Let me spell it out for you: **THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME PATTERN.** For the past month (and longer!) all of these stock shave traded roughly the same. Trading algos grouped them all together and since then these stocks have pretty much rode together and died together (more of the latter than the former). So why are they trading together?

1. They're all electric vehicle-related stocks. Three make cars, one make EV batteries. They're intrinsically similar, although they differ in the products they offer.
2. They are also all the result of a **SPAC** merger. This term, I believe, stands for ""**S**hitty **P**iece **'A** **C**rap"" stocks. They're called this because they were pumped more furiously than Austin Powers' member after being cryogenically unfrozen. I'm not even kidding -- if you zoom out on the 6 month on HYLN's stock chart, you'll see a perfect representation of a pair of balls and a big old chubby-stubby. This stock has **big dick energy**, my boys. Anyway, after they pumped like an antiquated sex-depraved 90s reference, they dumped faster than your grade 6 girlfriend dumped you after she found out you not only pick your nose, but you *eat the boogies too*. Fucking gross. You should've taken the cue and stopped doing that *then*. Anyway, they're shitty **stocks** because they got people to buy into hype and then sell into fear. [Hedge funds](https://i.ibb.co/fYsHcXF/citadel-HYLN.png) *love 'em. (*[Source](https://fintel.io/so/us/hyln)*).* If you want to know for real what a SPAC is, you can look it up yourself. I can't do all your homework *for* you, geez.  
(Note: shitty ""stocks"" does not necessarily mean shitty ""companies"")
3. They were all on the receiving end of short reports.

In this thread, I'm going to do a *very* basic comparison of the four companies mentioned above by looking specifically at:

* Their fundamentals (the dollars comin' in and the dollars goin' out)
* The short reports

# Fundamentals -- Don't be deceived, there's nothing fun about them

A company's fundamentals means the money coming in and the money going out. Fundamentals are notoriously boring to track, and would often involve people combing through beefy quarterly (10-Q) and annual (10-K) reports and alt-tabbing between them and an Excel spreadsheet that they would mash data into. Now, there's a better way of easily visualizing companies' earnings across quarters and years:

[Macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/) \-- this site is dope, but before you access it, I suggest you get familiar with the base-10 counting system. Maybe try attending some remedial classes at your local kindergarten until you're more familiar with double- and triple-digit numbers before you start perusing it.

Anyway, as we're looking at a **basket** (see that? that's called spaced repetition, and it's good for brain-learning) of pre-earnings growth stocks fresh off the SPAC, there's a few things specifically that are important to look at for these types of companies:

* **Cash** \-- I don't give many fucks about inventory; long-term investments; property, plant, and equipment. For an unproven company that will have some nasty-ass start-up bills to pay, cash is king.
* **Debt** \-- it's good to think about how start-ups are going to pay off debt, but I already checked and these four companies have no or next-to-no debt. We can ignore this one for now.
* **Net income** \-- as these companies are start-ups that are still ramping up production and incurring losses, we need to know how much money is going out of these companies. How much time do they have left before they need to raise funds through dilution, or worse -- before they implode?
* **YUIDDIAPRCB** \-- A term I totally didn't just make up right no, which stands for Years Until Insolvency, Dilution, or Debt Issuance, At Present Rate of Cash Burn
* **Market Cap** \-- the ""value"" of a company, as determined by complex algorithms developed by teams of computer scientists which track market sentiment, institutional and dark pool trading, and calculate and weigh probabilities of positive outcomes, as well as by guys named ""Matt"" who just started trading ""stonks"" after receiving a ""stimmy"", and who once tried to take a screenshot of a new crack on his phone screen after scratching his ass and then smelling his finger. Basically, it's calculated as (Number of shares in existence) x (Price of shares)
* **Market Cap (compared to HYLN as a %)** \-- because that's the stock I'm looking at, after all.

Now, it would be pretty retarded to look only at these numbers when analyzing a company. What if HYLN's product is Tits in the age of Asstagram, and QS is selling Big Ole Badonkadonks? Excellent point, zoomer. Well, I would venture so far as to say that **none** of these companies have proven, legitimate, and desirable products. Sure, each of them has *some* claim to credibility (well-known investors on the board, industry professionals serving as execs, product deals, etc.), but until they start producing and shipping in quantity, they're yet unproven. With that said -- does QS deserve to be valued 8x higher than HYLN despite having 1/16 of its ""lifespan"" at their current rates of cash burn? Not, IMO, when you consider the short reports.

# Short Reports: The only time being short pays off

As I mentioned, each of these companies has had a short report issued about them in the past few months, causing a pretty drastic drop in their share prices. Now, I know shorts have been unfairly demonized on WSB lately by people who only just learned what a ""short seller"" is a few months ago, and even then still can't quite truly wrap their head around what it means to sell a stock you haven't bought. In actuality, banning short selling has been found to be [unhealthy for the market](https://www.wsj.com/articles/restraints-on-short-selling-wouldnt-calm-markets-11584906733). The fact is, short sellers are actually healthy for the market -- **IF** they short **ethically**.

What does it mean to **short** **ethically**?

Ethical shorting means identifying fraudulent companies and punishing them for lying to or misleading investors. These companies often publish short reports -- information and intel that suggests that the targeted company may be misrepresenting their business in some way. Ethical shorters should be honest with their reporting. Yes, they *do* stand to make a profit off of people selling or joining them on their short-train (as opposed to the short bus with which you, dear reader, might be better acquainted). Still, if you identify substantial securities fraud and raise the alarm to ordinary investors, should you really be reviled for profiting from the resulting declining share price?

A writer for the [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-jan-20-fi-petruno20-story.html) even referred to short sellers as ""\[maybe\] the last bastion of hard-nosed research left on Wall Street."" This was back in 2002 though, so he could never have anticipated the current golden-age of hard-nosed research that is WallStreetBets' stonks and updoots; rocket and diamond hands emoji spam; and Tendies and Golden Fuckboy awards.

If you're still not following, let me put it this way: If I had warned you all the way back in 2000, with very public and easily-accessible research, that Enron was a big scam, would I have deserved to be demonized for then profiting from a collapse in the company's share price? Of course not, because I would've been right -- it **was** a big scam, and I **did** warn people.

So now that we can agree that the ""short seller bad!"" monochotomy is fucking infantile, let's try a slightly more nuanced dichotomy:

* Some short seller **bad**
* Some short seller *good*

Now, let's break down the short reports for each of the above companies. I've saved the best for last.

Now, I know ""length"" and ""titles"" aren't the best indicators of the quality and trustworthiness of a short report, but I *have* read parts of each of these short reports. However, I am but *one* man. I can't analyze, qualify, and verify every single assertion made therein. Suffice to say, they're all pretty damning IMO. All except for *one* \-- Hyliion's (naturally). And I *will* be analyzing, qualifying, and verifying every single assertion made about the company. Coming to a WSB near you. *Soon*. My final DD on HYLN^(\*).

^(\*for the foreseeable future, anyway. I mean, I can't think of anything else to write about the company so after my next thread, I'mma probably just chill for a bit.)

*Note: The short reports for NKLA, RIDE, and QS do a good enough job on their own of raising some red flags about these companies. Other writers have delved deep and written responses to these short reports -- some in support, others in opposition -- so if you're interested in those companies, I suggest you read those instead, because I'm not as knowledgeable on those companies. I'm really only focusing on HYLN. If anyone has any interest in analyzing the success rate of the above short groups, I'd be interested to know. I'll be sharing my research about Bonitas and their report on HYLN in the coming days. Stay tuned.*

# Summary: I've Used Up All My Creative Juice By Now So Just Take It Raw Edition

Basket stocks, fundamentals, short reports -- so what? What do we do with this information?

We use it to help contextualize our positions:

**""Boo, HYLN is down today.""**

Did anything about the company change? No? Then who gives a shit?

**""Yay, HYLN is up today!""**

Same question: Did anything about the company change? No? Then who give-- actually, **fuck it**, it's kind of nice to see the stock *not* go down 5 days in a row for once. Let me bask in this fleeting glow while I still can.

Anyway, my point is that price action alone is not great at determining the price of a company.  If these four fairly different companies can all trade together, there will certainly be pricing inefficiencies. HYLN needs to divorce itself from the rest of the pack before we can really see the stock take off."

2021-04-23 11:20:42,wallstreetbets,"Nice Post but once HYLN starts actually producing it's hybrid solution in a few years, the market will have its eye on the tech that's going to make them obsolete, right? Then they'll have to move onto the next thing and this uncertainty will continue, meaning it'll never moon. Not only does their product have to be better, it has to be so much better that a completely green solution won't hold a candle to it. That's a big ask. If this were 10 years ago I'd be all-in but I don't see how hybrid solutions could have a decent lifespan anymore. 

You know much more than I do so if you can make my comment look retarded I'll buy."

I've already addressed this point in my first DD.

1. You're ignoring the fact that their vehicles can be equipped with hydrogen fuel cells

2. You're assuming that the company will be unable to adapt in the future to changing market conditions.

3. HYLN's hypertruck can run off of RNG, which can even be carbon negative."

2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"End of Week Market Report: Week of Friday, 4/23/2021 Hello Traders and Investors! What a week right?! So many stories and earnings! Here is my weekly recap which I share every Friday to help to wrap your head around these markets! Feel free to DM me any of your questions and happy trades! 

The S&P 500 opened at $4138.78 today, lower than its previous Friday’s close of $4185.67 and its 52 week high of 4,191.31. Recovery from COVID has seen significant gains in the market as prices pull back from last week’s all-time-highs. 

Reports released Thursday that President Biden could propose a capital gains tax increase to 39.6% on individuals earning $1 million dollars or more, nearly double the current nominal rate of 20%. Additionally, a 3.8% investment tax currently exists to fund Obamacare. This potentially pushes the tax rate 43.4% which conflicts with long standing tax practices that have historically seen investment income lower than labor taxes. Such an increase seeks to address long standing notions of wealthy individuals paying lower tax rates than middle and low-income workers, a sentiment that President Biden campaigned on and championed. 

Members of the GOP suggest the increase will halt economic growth, leading those affected to hoard assets in order to avoid the tax. It is unclear if these claims will hold water, as historically there has been a low correlation between increases to the capital gains tax and the market. In 2013 the S&P experienced stellar growth of 30% despite an increase to capital gains tax of over 86%. 

Jobless claims dropped more than 7% from last week according to the Labor Department. This coincides with robust gains in the market as a whole as the country recovers from last year’s COVID pandemic. Current job loss from pre-COVID era still hovers around 8 million. Increase in national vaccine rollouts, averaging 3 million per day, should expedite this recovery. Approximately 40% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine.  
Several major travel companies reported earnings this week. This includes American Airlines, United Airlines, Royal Caribbean. The International Air Transport Association has commented on the situation, citing potential losses in the sector of $48 Billion for the 2021 fiscal year. These numbers are over a 25% increase from previously released estimates of $38 Billion. Although significant, losses are down significantly from last year, where the industry suffered a $126.4 Billion loss in the wake of COVID shutdowns. 

American Airlines posted dismal earnings of -$5.54 per share Thursday. A spokesperson for American Airlines said the company is spending around $30 Million per day in operations costs, despite reducing annual operating costs by $1.3 Billion. The company continues to consolidate and revealed it expects to reduce its workforce by 1,600 in the coming months. In addition, American Airlines reportedly reached a deal with Boeing to delay delivery of twenty-three 737 jets for up to 3 years. American Airlines posted revenue of 4.01 Billion, just under half of it’s posted revenue only a year ago. Airports are functioning at around 60% of their capacity. 

""We continued to excel in growing customer relationships in our market focus areas of mobility, fiber and HBO Max,"" said AT&T CEO John Stankey in reference to a favorable Q1 Earnings report for the communications giant. Q1 Earnings reports reveal an excellent quarter for the company, who continues to grow in cell-service subscribers. AT&T also posted favorable results for its HBO Max service, which it received in its 2018, $85 Billion acquisition of Time Warner. 

A Tesla vehicle was involved in a fatal crash that killed two people over the weekend. The car was suspected to have been functioning on Autopilot by investigators as it was found with no occupant in the driver’s seat. Tesla has revealed that they have no data that suggests the vehicle was on Autopilot during the crash at this time Tesla did not rule out the possibility that further investigation may reveal the vehicle was in-fact on autopilot, but declined to make any additional comments at this time. 

Discord, a popular chat application developed for gamers, has ended months-long acquisition talks with tech giant Microsoft. Market Valuation of Discord has skyrocketed to $10 Billion from last year’s June valuation of $3.5 Billion. This comes at a time where many social media platforms are looking to develop and integrate chat functions in a way to capture user engagement and capitalize on the increase in remote work. Discord now intends to stay independent and pursue an IPO. 

The decision by Discord comes as Salesforce looks to acquire Slack in Q2 ‘21 for $27 Billion. Slack operates a chatroom not unlike Discord, but targeted at businesses as opposed to consumers. The acquisition is currently pending a U.S. Justice Department probe that will determine whether or not it will continue. Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Discord on the heels of Slack’s pending acquisition is likely a response to increased competition for Microsoft from Salesforce in the B2B and B2C technology markets. 

Netflix reached 208 million subscribers in Q1, just missing its projection of 210 million. The tech giant blames this miss on societal normalization as COVID regulations ease and more people return to work. Quarantine mandates saw a massive increase of 16 million new subscribers in the early months, and just over 10 million between April and June of 2020. In contrast, January through April of 2021 saw only 4 million new subscribers.  Regardless, the streaming giant reported an earnings per share of $3.75, versus $1.57 the year prior, which beat Wall Street predictions. Netflix’s 2020 subscriber boom showed massive financial gains in revenue, operating income, and operating margin. Q2 forecasts project a slight correction to this growth due to job growth and general societal rebound.

2021-04-23 12:01:43,wallstreetbets,Agreed! He kills it. Iconic. I remember hearing the part was written for Prince originally but for some reason he dropped out. He probably would’ve done a great job in his own right but def would be different. And apparently Willis was antagonizing Chris Tucker that the movie was gonna be career ending stinker while they were filming!
2021-04-23 11:01:46,wallstreetbets,"Agree, as a kid I found the character a bit annoying but funny.

Now I just love him and find him hilarious. I can both relate to him in his flamboyance and desire to be popular, but also to the others who find him super annoying.

Great acting, re-watching the movie I always love to see his introduction:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK8ednS0skQ"
2021-04-23 12:17:33,wallstreetbets,"Some people had a problem with Tucker/that character in this movie, and that always annoyed me. He's not like Jar Jar Binks, annoying for no reason. There's a reason his character is the way he is - basically a statement about the future. Similar to how the security guards are all complete wusses (because everyone is a wuss and they've not had real adversity), how nearly every woman in this is wearing scant clothing and the police have basically finished their militarization. And I think his character was a brilliant touch and Tucker played it better than anyone else I could imagine in the role."
2021-04-23 11:41:15,wallstreetbets,The writing and this acting also completely called what a ton of influencers are like
2021-04-23 12:57:13,wallstreetbets,I don't understand how he knew how to act this character so well. I mean it's so original and hilarious.
2021-04-23 13:48:36,wallstreetbets,Wish Chris tucker did more movies.  He was a fucking gem
2021-04-23 14:41:14,wallstreetbets,"I went to standup show he did in 2012, guy is hilarious"

But he was absolutely perfect.

Bonus facts:

The director wanted Bruce Willis to be constantly annoyed looking for the whole movie, so he intentionally made him re shoot over and over the same scenes with little direction.

Also 

The protagonist and antagonist not only don't meet each other, they don't know of each other's existence! One of the only movies to do so."

I have a feeling (but can't think of any evidence) that Zorg owned the trash collector company but something happened resulting in the pile up of garbage at the airport (space port?). Were the trash collectors fired or on strike? I don't think it's ever explained. My theory is that Zorg was basically running his empire into the ground while under controll of the evil thing; all that that mattered was getting the stones. What was in it for Zorg if anything? Was there a deal (of course the evil thing wouldn't have held up it's end of the bargain) or was the evil thing controlling him? Much of Zorg's story is unknown."

*Note: This is my first true DD here. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. This is only my opinion about the stock and any action you take based on my opinions is done at your own risk. In my opinion, I do not like this stock.*

***1.*** ***Intro***

Greetings Apes and Apettes! I'm excited and a little scared to post my first DD here. I learned of WSB like many of you and have been commenting and trying to be a good ape since January when I jumped on the GaymeStonk hype train. While I knew quite a bit about the market due to my work and education, I will admit that my investment strategy up to this point has been ""buy Vanguard Index Funds."" Safe, but boring. Being a part of this community has pushed me to go out of my comfort zone and finally make an ape gamble on something other than buying GaymeStonk shares.

So, I've been reading your DDs, watching the financial news, and just generally paying more attention to the markets in search of my first options play. I need to earn my stripes, one way or another, and I have found my first target: [$LADR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LADR?p=LADR).

***2.*** ***The Target: $LADR***

**Ladder Capital Corp** is a REIT traded on the NYSE with a market cap of just under 1.5BN. It's not a huge company by any stretch and options volume is a little low, but hopefully not so low that this post gets clipped. The company was started after the 2008 crash by three former executives who all worked for an internal real estate hedge fund at UBS. That HF collapsed after making investments in the subprime housing market. **I'm sure they learned their lesson and vowed** ***never to do that again***. RIGHTTTTT.

In fact, what they're doing now is *probably worse*, though the fallout may not be on the same scale as what happened in 2008. After all, the entire CMBS market is only **\~$500B**, as opposed to the residential housing market at \~**$8T** just before the crash (btw, current housing market sits at \~**$35T** \*\*\*whistles\*\*\*)**.** So, even if the entire CMBS industry goes tits up, we're not looking at a complete economic meltdown like we had in 2008, *unless it causes other dominos to fall, but that's another topic..*. Anyway, we can still make money if the thesis is correct, right? So, read on, dear apes.

What set me down this path was [this recent article](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/), which someone coincidentally linked in a GaymeStonk thread. Weird, I know, but take a read if you have a few minutes as it forms the basis of my thesis.

Reading this article first is sort of putting the cart before the horse, but the main point is that [Professor John M. Griffin](http://www.jgriffin.info/bio/) from UTA, decided to do a forensic analysis of claims made by an SEC whistleblower and found those claims to be **correct**. The claims will be discussed in one second, but just know that this guy's specialty is ""*forensic finance, or understanding the role of anything that is potentially illegal, illicit or immoral in financial markets*."" If you want to read the actual paper Mr. Griffin published, you will definitely develop some extra brain wrinkles. The paper can be found [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162). It's a good, but technical, read.

Anyway, according to Griffin, the worst offenders when it comes to income overstatement are shown on the right side of this graph:

[Most of these companies, especially the shadow banks, \\""above the line\\"" are probably decent put plays](https://preview.redd.it/jjhp7uzafxu61.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=beaccc420be5712dfa89752d34f5e9586c8d26c6)

*Smol aside*: *I was curious if John Griffin and Kenny Griffin from Shitadel are related or if it's pure coincidence that they have the same last name. I can't find anything saying they are related, so let's chalk it up to a common last name. That said, it appears that Shitadel thinks $LADR is garbage, too, as* [*they have been getting rid of their shares and have purchased substantial additional puts*](https://fintel.io/so/us/ladr/citadel-advisors-llc)*. I feel dirty that I may be on the same side of a bet as Kenny G, but what's an ape gonna do???*

Anyway, the genesis of the Griffin study was a 2019 SEC whistleblower complaint that is discussed in this Pro Publica article from  **May of 2020:** [https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds](https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds). The article describes a complaint filed by [John Flynn](https://commercialobserver.com/2018/07/john-flynn-cmbs-transparent/), [a veteran of the CMBS industry](http://creloanadvisors.com/), which alleges rampant overstating of borrower income to prop up shitty loans that were packaged into CMBS by 14 major lenders including Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, and our target Ladder Capital Corp. The world renowned plaintiff's class action attorneys at **Quinn Emanuel** have taken note of the impending CMBS market correction and issued a very detailed and easy to read [firm memo](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/the-firm/publications/us-outlook-potential-cmbs-litigation-arising-from-the-2020-downturn/) on the subject, which explains the myriad ways this thing could fall apart.

Anyway, $LADR isn't just taking loans originated by unrelated mortgage loan officers from various banks around the country and packaging those up into shitty CDOs. No no; they are **originating the loans themselves** and then packaging those crap loans together with other, better looking loans, and then **securitizing the garbage for their customers in an inflated CMBS.** I shit you not. Seems weird to risk your reputation by selling crap, but more on that later.

On top of the above, the firm appears to be engaging in some pretty shady practices when repackaging loans acquired from other lenders that had been part of a previous a CMBS that was unwound. Flynn's whistleblower complaint states that Ladder has been revising the previous income statements of the borrowers such that their **net profits were overstated anywhere from 10-30%** from what was reported by the prior lender, meaning they were given much larger loans than they are capable of paying off.

All of this just screams SHORT THIS SHIT, but if you want another reason to hate on Ladder, and I'm not trying to make this political, note that one of Ladder's largest investors is **Steven Ross.** If you don't know him, let's just say he's a billionaire BFF with 45 and, get this, Ladder is [one of the Trump organization's biggest creditors.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/08/09/billionaire-stephen-ross-holds-stake-in-one-of-trumps-biggest-creditors/?sh=7a2848863af4) Whatever you think about Trump as a President, one thing we know for certain is that he's [not that great at real estate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html)**. Seriously, don't make this political**. This is about *fraud and bad bets in the CRE market*, not politics.

The final point I will make here is that the outlook for CRE for 2021 is just not that good overall, to say nothing of the CMBS market. The [National Association of Realtors is predicting](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-q4-commercial-real-estate-trends-and-outlook-survey-01-21-2021.pdf) Q1 2021 CRE prices ""to decrease in the office market (-3% y/y), retail (-6% y/y), and hotel/hospitality (-6% y/y)."" Guess what markets $LADR is heavily invested in? That's right; [office, retail, and hospitality](https://s2.q4cdn.com/455099226/files/doc_downloads/company_overview/2021/03/Ladder-Capital-Company-Overview-(March-2021).pdf).

***3. Timing***

So, this shit is shady and Ladder seems ripe for a fall, along with the rest of the CMBS market. In fact, I think you could make this bet against most of the offending lenders identified in the Griffin study, but especially against the shadow banks like Ladder. Thus, the real question is; **when lambo**???

This is a REALLY tough question and where this play certainly opens the door to either major gain or major loss porn. ***Please, only bet what you're able to lose***.

The problem, of course, is that the market was made aware of this malfeasance when Flynn filed his complaint **in February 2019**. Flynn was under the assumption that 10 year commercial loans sold in the run up to 2008 crash would be defaulting in 2017-2018, but that didn't happen. From the Quinn Emanuel memo: ""*Commercial loans backing CMBS typically have a shorter term than the residential mortgage loans backing RMBS, and a different amortization schedule. For example, a standard CMBS loan will have a 10-year term during which it will pay mostly interest and very little (or no) principal, with a large “balloon” payment of principal at the end. Often, the loan is refinanced at the end of its term, meaning that some or all of the balloon payment becomes the subject of a new loan, with a new term, which is frequently then secured in a new CMBS.*"" So, when the original CMBS 1.0 loan defaults didn't show up in the market, Flynn started digging and found that the original loans had simply been repackaged and papered over to new investors based on the **newly restated and inflated NOI** numbers, which triggered his SEC complaint.

But, the SEC hasn't acted on the complaint (AFAIK) and the market just didn't give a shit. Oh yeah, his complaint isn't actually public, either. What's more, Feb 2019-Mar 2020 was a banner year for CMBS returns and commercial real estate in general. Further, most analysts of the CMBS market agree that the new ""CMBS 2.0"" market is much healthier than the CMBS 1.0, i.e. pre-2008, market, so ***there's a chance I am completely wrong on this***.

All that said, the $LADR stock price did plunge from its ATH of $19 in Feb 2020 to about $3 in March 2020 due to the **COVID scare** that caused a broader market downturn at that time, but it has steadily inched back up to where it is today, at around **$11**. How can that be if their business is built on a pack of lies?

Well, as the Pro Publica article mentions, the Fed [threw a bunch of money at the CMBS market via the CARES Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm) last April (PPP, mortgage forbearance, etc.), which likely kicked the can down the road. And while Biden's recent **$1.9T** **American Rescue Plan** doesn't contain any *direct support* for the CMBS industry, it's clear that the QE provided by that plan will likely push any widespread CMBS correction further into 2021 or 2022. This aligns with some speculation by the Motley Fool (\*throws up a little\*) back in June that people should keep their eyes open for CMBS failures ""[over the next 12 to 24 months](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-financing/articles/cmbs-fraud-allegations-propublica-and-industry-veteran/)."" There's also an outside chance that the [2020 Hope Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7809?r=98&s=1), which ""*establishes an equity facility in the Department of the Treasury to assist commercial mortgage borrowers*,"" could still pass and kick this failure can further down the road.

All that said, my prediction is that we'll likely see a *short term uptick* in the CRE market as businesses come back on-line following the easing of COVID restrictions, but this won't be enough to save the market from bad underwriting. The [Griffin study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162) supports this when it says, on page 4, that ""*the difference between dubious and duteous originators will persist after the current COVID crisis.*"" So, we'll eventually see the house of cards collapse and I'm going to bet it does so **by the end of this year or early next year**. Now, if there is some wider market correction \*\*\*cough CLO/Treasury collapse\*\*\*, this could all happen *much sooner*. Note, the farthest out you can buy puts on this stock is 12/17/2021. \*\*\*sad trombone\*\*\*

I will also be paying close attention to the $**LADR** **Q1 earnings release on May 3, 2021.** Current EPS consensus is .08/share, which is the same as it was for Q4 2020, but which the company missed by .03/share (actual EPS was .05/share). Note, the company issued a dividend of $.20/share in the lead up to their Q4 2020 earnings report, and they have [done the same for Q1 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ladder-capital-corp-announces-first-201500466.html). Accordingly, I'm also predicting **a** **30% miss on EPS for Q1 2021**, just like Q4 last year. I don't anticipate, however, that this EPS miss will have a huge impact on share price. Might drop it a buck or so in the short term. The real fall will come when their shitty loans start going bad later this year.

***4. Target Price***

As far as price goes, this is where I get out of my depth. I am just not equipped to crunch all these numbers from the articles and read financial statements and all that shit in order to say the company is going to drop by X%, so I'm just going with my gut feeling here. **I would really love some help on this point from some wrinkly brain apes who are good with numbers.**

So, I'm just going to look at what happened to the stock back in March 2020 and say that it will probably happen again when the shit hits the fan; ***the price will drop to around \~$4-5/share.***

***5. Counterarguments***

So, there are obviously a lot of counterarguments on which I would be happy to get some feedback. I have considered these, but maybe not weighted them strongly enough, in drawing my conclusions. I welcome your comments and criticism on these and any other counterarguments I may have missed:

* Even if $LADR is chronically overstating the income of their borrowers, the value of **the underlying real estate may be sufficient collateral** to stem any losses from widespread defaults.
* **Most analysts are bullish on this stock**, with the consensus rating now being to **buy**. Current analyst price target range is $12.50 - $14.00 with **an average of $12.80/share**.
* As the Intercept article posted above notes, Ladder's ""[three largest tenants are Dollar General, BJ’s, and Walgreens.](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/)” This is good for Ladder given the current inflationary economic environment as consumers are looking for ways to save money and discount retailers benefit from this. In fact, Dollar General is having an amazing year. Their stock price has gone up about [55%](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/DG#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--) from **$140** following the March 2020 crash to **$218** yesterday. So, **if Ladder's largest tenants continue to do well, Ladder may be able to absorb/mitigate any loses** from their poor underwriting for other borrowers.
* **Ladder's business is not limited to CMBS origination and securitization**. They also are a commercial landlord, which could, again, offset any losses from their CMBS shenanigans.
* **Ladder won't be holding the bag** if these CMBS fail; *their investors will*. As the Flynn study notes; ""*the loan originator is not paid according to the loan’s future performance, but from fees and markups when the loan is sold... \[Accordingly,\] originators and underwriters may have incentives to build and burn their reputation.*"" So, there's always a possibility that **these securities fail, but** **Ladder survives**.

***6. Closing***

Boy, if you've read this far, I really appreciate you and would welcome your thoughts and criticism.

I feel pretty good about this thesis, but not good enough to YOLO, since it's my first time doing something like this. In fact, I've only made a very small investment by purchasing the following Puts:

* 20 x 12/17/2021 $7.50p @ $.25/share

If I'm correct, my potential gain is **\~900%:**

|Cost of Contracts (20 contracts @ .25/share = 2000 shares x .25 = $500) + $20 commission|$520|
|:-|:-|
|Cost of 2000 shares @ $5 price target|$10,000|
|Right to sell 2000 shares @ $7.50 strike|$15,000|
|Profit from share sale|$5,000|
|Profit minus cost of contracts|$4,480|
|Total Return (4480/500)|**896%**|

Yes, a \~$4.5K profit on a $500 investment is **small potatoes**, but I want to dip my toe in the water and see if my ape brain is working properly before taking bigger risks.

Let me know what I missed, fellow apes and, again, thanks for reading!

2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AMD earnings coming for at long term winner Ok Monkeys here is a short dd ( will make a more more detailed one if there is interest, let me know below)

AMD   sells chips to a variety of sectors but you can mainly categorize it  into to two categories: Computing&Graphics and Enterprise ( Embedded   and Semi-Custom). Basically if there is a need for calculations they   make the chips.  As you might have noticed there has been a supply  shortage lately causing semi conductors prices to sky rocket- if you  have been trying to buy one lately you will know. So AMD is a part of a  mega trend and there is a clip of the psycho CEO mama who has been on Sir shithouse aka Cramer telling him it is good for business ( cant post the video but you can google ""AMD CEO gives update on Xilinx acquisition and talks chip shortage impact"")

The CEO mama Su is nothing short of a genius. PhD in electro engineering from MIT she has been running the show since 2014 where AMD was a mess. I shall not go into the accounting details but basically she knows her   stuff and the development of the stock price reflects just that

From 4 dlls a share to now be around 80

&#x200B;

Intel  came out yesterday with a great earnings report but more or less  explicitly saying they are losing market share despite the market is hit  by a supply shock. AMD will report on Tuesday and if you fancy a bet  you can buy calls for that or you can just like the stock, or if you feel adventurous buy LEAPS.

Whatever the case AMD looks to be a long term winner with the best products,   best management in a sector that will thrive going forward. I dont   really consider it a long term risk and i hold it and have done so for   quite sometime"
2021-04-23 08:42:21,wallstreetbets,"Lets hope so, im down 90% on my june $95 calls"
2021-04-23 09:59:18,wallstreetbets,"I have AMD LEAPS.  I'm just warning you all, they blow away the numbers every earnings call and the stock still drops immediately following earnings release.  Its absolutely retarded, like WSB level retardation, but that's what usually happens.  Be warned.  Go long and prosper."
2021-04-23 09:00:08,wallstreetbets,It’s been a long for me for many years.  So waffling between 70 to 80 doesn’t matter to me.  A couple years from now or less it’ll be a lot more.  I’m hoping 100.  Day trading is an talent that I don’t have.  All the best.
2021-04-23 09:05:58,wallstreetbets,Intel's datacenter revenue is down 20%. If AMD took their marketshare the earnings will be huge.
2021-04-23 09:13:54,wallstreetbets,"I see AMD, I upvote and comment

I hope you wrote something bullish"
2021-04-23 08:38:28,wallstreetbets,"Oh man, I almost downvoted out of instinct because I saw a meme stonk in the title. May Sue Bae forgive me.

I failed that assignment. Apparently I don’t understand diversification well enough."

2021-04-23 08:58:35,wallstreetbets,"I've got 10% in AMD and as with everything in my folio (except $SKLZ and $HWIN -lul-) it's an indefinite hold (until I'm forced to take it out, basically). What  I really want is to round it out with NVDA and INTC, though, which I think are super overpriced right now. I'd like to get NVDA at under $400 and INTC at under $50.  


I'd love to put more into PLTR, but it's already 13%.  


Analysts sure love downgrading AMD every day, though. I'm not sure how much of that is due to chip shortage and how much of that is them thinking that INTC has some magic insta-turnaround in store or NVDA is somehow going to bite off the whole server market or something silly.  


I just wish my cost basis wasn't so high, but i was sick as fuck for most of the last two  years and simply couldn't play the game. Missed out on TSLA because of that, too."

2021-04-23 13:35:05,wallstreetbets,as a computer enthusiast and also someone that works in IT. AMD has been killing intel this past 5 or so years. They have been ahead on them and constantly innovating. I been long on amd ever since amd64 was released and look forward to a very bright future with them. I look forward to switch to amd in our data center too when the need comes for the upgrade.
2021-04-23 10:09:29,wallstreetbets,"AMD was down to 15% of my portfolio by ATH, I've been buying back to 25% as it dipped and churned,  now I'm ready to see that surge back to $95."
2021-04-23 10:20:36,wallstreetbets,"Intel's cloud revenue is down 30% during a pandemic where everyone else can't grow fast enough. AWS by 30%, Azure by 50%... Intel have a massive hole in the ship and Wallsteet is trying to use flex tape to keep it afloat. The stock is long overdue a massive correction. 

It's unbelievable that AMD is stuck trading where it is when the competition is THIS bad."

2021-04-23 10:54:02,wallstreetbets,As a consumer I’ve liked AMD since forever. I got in early (at like $5-8) and it’s been a great long term hold. I expect it to continue to grow especially as Ryzen gains popularity
2021-04-23 12:12:01,wallstreetbets,I own shares in AMD. This makes me happy. I have faith in them.

2021-04-23 11:59:29,wallstreetbets,"When AMD finally got desperate enough to stop letting itself be driven into the dirt by MBAs and handed the keys to a PhD engineer, then everybody was anticipating the Ryzen CPU releases which came out the day after reporting ""disappointing"" earnings.  Well duh to anyone in the tech space, no one in their right mind was going to buy the prior gen chips when a whole new revolutionary architecture was being released shortly.  But, most of the people in the market don't know anything about the companies they're investing in, so the stock tanked.  It was a no brainer.  Oh and they were making all the CPU/GPU chips in all the new gaming consoles coming out too.  I figured I'd buy some, and wait until there was some sign of either Intel hitting back or AMD doing something stupid (like replacing Dr. Su with an MBA).  Up 140% and Intel just keeps shooting themselves in the foot and losing market share to AMD...  The market does not seem to give one single shit about their earnings, though.  The past few quarters they have announced rockstar earnings blowing way past expectations by huge margins and every single time the share price takes a bit hit in response.  Then it grows until next earnings, where they are again monumental, and the share price dips again.  Weird, but whatever.  I'll stick with Dr. Su."

2021-04-23 14:41:20,wallstreetbets,"hard to say for this ER, historically AMD falls flat or pops intraday and then settles by the next session. personally I think a long theta play is better here and picking up some LEAPS post earnings when the vol decreases is a good set up to capture the run ups to earnings for july and october. who knows maybe they will finally pop off, but IMO the geopoltical tensions and climate impacts facing taiwan pose serious systematic risks to production, especially with the summer on the way.

2021-04-23 13:31:13,wallstreetbets,"Bullish on AMD, but bear in mind the Chip Shortage isn’t necessarily a benefit to them.  The chip shortages are based on a lack of foundry capacity.  AMD spun off their foundries some years back, and those foundries then gave up on next Gen production.  

They are are dependent on an increase in foundry output by TSMC and Samsung just like any other fabless shop."

2021-04-23 10:37:13,wallstreetbets,I haven't looked at historical trends for AMD around earnings time but if it's similar to INTC don't expect great things regardless of how they do at earnings (pirced in).  I had a reminder on my calendar that I put on there over a month ago to buy INTC today because they make more money than Allah and their stock always dips a day or two after earnings.
2021-04-23 10:48:30,wallstreetbets,This thing has been doing nothing for 6 months. Now it s time to fly. If earnings suck i get rid of it and get PLBY

2021-04-23 12:55:24,wallstreetbets,"**The Bull**

INTC P/E is 12.8, market cap $260B

AMD P/E is 40.6, market cap $99B

If we were to value INTC the same as we do AMD, it's market cap would be $824B

If we do the inverse on AMD, it's market cap would be $31B

INTC is undervalued, because it's PE is low by any measure. A PE of 12.8 is less than most boomer stonks. The reason it's so low is because there is growing concern that it will continue to lose market share.

AMDs PE is also undervalued. A PE of 40 is about right for any tech stonk, it's literally an exact match to MSFTs P/E.

But why is it undervalued? Because AMD has lots of room to grow. It's growth can easily keep up with it's current valuation. Every earnings report is a massive double digit growth in every business segment. And every time it's stonk trades flat, or even dips a % or two after earnings. 

Why? because it's priced in. At a ~40 P/E, it's expected that AMD will keep growing. So double digit growth is no surprise.

**Now let's look at the LONG bear..**

Both are over-valued. Yep, even with INTC at 12 P/E and AMD at 39 P/E, there is a long term bear care


**The 200 IQ move**

ARM is moving into desktop & server space. Which means the ever growing x86 market is going stale.

INTC is still undervalued at todays P/E

**The retard**

Fuck x86 & ARM, get in on display chips.

Daddy Elon and his retarded touch screen bullshit is further going to fuel the big touchscreens in cars.
Most cars already have NAV screens, and most are touch. But just like fake exhaust tips, to fake rearview mirrors that are actually displays, to fake mirrors that are display. The EVERYTHING IS NOW A DISPLAY design philosophy has kicked in.

The Toyota Corolla is the best selling most reliable vehicle on the plant. Toyota will never sacrifice quality and reliability for cheap gimmicks. The Corolla features are always several years behind other models/makes. This is because Toyota will only allow fully vetted and proven products in their cash cow.

Next generation Corolla will feature a fake display in the rearview mirror. When this happens, you will regret not getting in on my retard play.

HIMX 14c after earnings, literally any date, and 15c to 17c LEAPS.

p.s. why not NVDA? cause it's priced in with 89 P/E."

2021-04-23 10:25:01,wallstreetbets,"Backing up on this; AMD moves quietly from my experience; been in since 17$. It doesn’t make big flashy leaps like 4 and 5% a day or anything north of that really. It moves 0.8% a day and you say to yourself ehh it’s just a little it’s not worth throwing money at something with such little movement. But at the end of the week you see that 1W timeline and see it’s up 4%. It’s quiet, it’s silent. And even after this last month or two it’s been down, but I trust Lisa Su more than others; she and the team and AMD continue to make insanely quality products and the only thing stopping them right now is a literally chip shortage. 

However be wary with options trading with AMD, leaps are realistically your best bet here and even with earnings it is notorious for dipping on good news unless it absolutely blows out earnings in which it will move up a lot. It’s a real gamble.
But when you invest and watch it in the “offseason” that is when it really shines.

If I were to guess; they have a good quarter report here and we see some stability but it ultimately settles around 84$/share and then we see 90$ a share by June.

That's only telling half the story. Sure, the price doesn't jump right after earnings - but that's because it's a regular victim of buy the rumour sell the news. AMD's price is jumping between the earnings.

AMD does climb, it's now roughly 10x in the last 3-4 years since I first got in. 

It's also ignoring that the xilinx merger has likely weighed on the stock because the market just doesn't understand it. 

I'm expecting another jump by the end of the year, AMD's projecting 37% revenue growth this year and their guidance is usually spot on.

Nope, only the vendors who had no choice (since they can't make x86 CPUs) did so and try to make you believe that it's a global trend. It isn't. Most compute code is relying on x86 and porting most libraries to Arm is a PITA. Su Bae knows what she does when she chose to ignore Arm."

Their GPUs are by the same guy AMD investors were happy to see the back of - and they're behind the ball on those with performance that's less than impressive even with Intel marketing tricks during the demos. They're not even using their own fabs for those... 

Getting off 14nm isn't really benefiting them in any substantial way other than investor facesaving. Their current 10nm chips are mostly just... bad. 

Their fabs at this point are a liability, not an asset. IBM had to PAY global foundries $1.5b to take their fabs on when they were in Intel's current position of behind behind the curve, and there's no sign of Intel being ahead of the curve for years to come at least.

>TSM already can't supply AMD enough chips. AMD has no way to solve this

That's just not even necessarily true. AMD's projecting 37% revenue increases this year, and AMD's due to switch to 5nm for some of its processors this year according to its own roadmap (likely EPYC), which will free up 7nm capacity for desktop/laptop production, on top of AMD increasing their wafer buys. You're just not paying attention. AMD's been choosing to not increase production, if it fits with their plans they can.

For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/k1mnsm/amd_further_increased_console_order_at_tsmc/"

It has taken a beating so far this year (plenty of 3%+ down days and a handful of 3%+ up days), but I think people are finally starting to realize a new CEO isn't going to fix intel's problems overnight, and AMD holds a significant advantage in a variety of sectors that isn't going away anytime soon."

2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SKLZ on April 23rd $SKLZ stock hit a high of $46.30 and currently sits in the $16’s. In the last two days, Cathie Wood added over 6 million shares across ARKK and ARKW, her biggest purchase by far. Technically speaking, SKLZ looks to be in a reversal path and the risk reward scenario is highly favorable. This company can honestly grow in huge multiples in the next 5 years and beyond. I see the price here being over $200 by end of 2023. 

DD:

1. SKLZ has 95% profit margins. Yes.... NINETY FIVE %. Although they are not profitable yet (they reinvest all profits into marketing efforts for growth), when they do become profitable, expected in 2022, the profits will grow wildly. They are debt free and have 600 million on their balance sheet however. 

2. SKLZ is a platform provider for betting between users who play Mobile games, the fastest growing gaming market. Think of SKLZ as the Shopify of gaming. $SHOP provides a platform to small e-commerce outfits whereas SKLZ provides a platform to the small game developers. SHOP was $10/share just 5 years ago. The mobile market is expected to double in the next 4 years. 

3. The US is only 10% of the worlds mobile gaming market, and SKLZ is in process of expanding to India this year. They have included the costs of India expansion into projections, but none of the projected revenues. India is a larger market and growing at a much faster rate. This could literally double revenues by next year. 

4. The CEO (Andrew Paradise) has stated as recently as yesterday that his company aims to “gamify” exercise, education, etc. He brought up what a Peloton partnership would look like in a Fool interview yesterday. Essentially, people would verse each other on their bikes. This would make it more fun and add a betting element. This partnership would be HUGE. 

5. SKLZ already has a partnership with the NFL for a developer to make a football-themed SKLZ app this year. They can easily make partnerships with the remaining sports organizations. SKLZ also intends to expand into first person shooters and racing games this year. 

Apes, this is a play that has been HIGHLY shorted (28% currently) from its top, and has the actual thematic story, fundamentals, and price targets to support a huge short term run, and long term growth."

While the financials look really good, I've heard not so great things about management. That said, in fairness, I only did like an hour of research as I wasn't even familiar with SKLZ until I heard all the chatter this week. I picked up a piddly $500 worth at $17.30 on the off chance it ran back up in a few weeks and I could wind up with burrito-money for the rest of the year.

It can't be quantified, but it's also quite possible that it TOOK that $1.50 to earn the $1 and I have to KEEP spending that $1.50 to make $1.  


The reality is that SKLZ doesn't have a 95% profit margin. A company can't just say, ""well, we're going to stop advertising, expanding, and spending on infrastructure anymore next month, and we'll still earn the same amount of revenue.""

2021-04-23 07:51:20,wallstreetbets,How? Seems like a more genuine account than half of the people in gme threads which are months old.
2021-04-23 09:09:40,wallstreetbets,"You actually sound like a decent dude from your post history.

Fuck you all the same though, I'm dipping my balls in this acid vat to see if they come out shiny smooth or dissolved."
2021-04-23 15:09:36,wallstreetbets,"No, i feel happy. Happy that your negative karma throwaway ass will not be taken seriously here."
2021-04-23 15:12:01,wallstreetbets,"It's my worst trade ever. My first loss in a year as well. But well, doing zero dd before a trade? I belong here."
2021-04-23 13:06:36,wallstreetbets,"True. Marketing and Infrastructure aren't the same, but the OP is lumping them together and ignoring them to come up with a ""95% profit"" figure... In some respects they are similar, though... They're both outlays intended to produce both short-term and long-term revenue. Marketing is mostly short-term, Infrastructure is far more long-term. In both cases, there's no guarantee that they'll continue an absurd ""95% profit"" level, neither cost can be swept aside, and both expenditures will continue, no matter what effect they have on revenue."
2021-04-23 13:22:34,wallstreetbets,"LOL! I can't think of a successful company that doesn't advertise/expand/spend on infrastructure. If they aren't doing those things, they don't deserve your investment."
2021-04-23 08:55:04,wallstreetbets,"Just my two cents but I’m pretty sure everything Cathie buys is being targeted by the big boys and their shorting friends at the HFs - she grew too fast and isn’t part of the club.  Personally I like SKLZ at $13, as they recently diluted the stock by 32M shares.  Cathie tried to set the floor with her big buy ins but she’s up against behemoths.  Patience on this one."
2021-04-23 09:59:33,wallstreetbets,"Yep, this is true. I’ve lurked for a few years, Reddit hasn’t really been my thing, but I figured my friends love the whole WSB attitude I’d have my first go at it. 

People can rationalize their opposition however they want, it doesn’t matter to me really. It’s stocks, you pick the gamble you like."
2021-04-23 12:20:14,wallstreetbets,"I am a decent dude, I am trying to save people's balls here."
2021-04-23 13:25:05,wallstreetbets,"I was speaking of advertising which is an essential part of growing a small company...like skillz.

BUT as time goes by they can get by with spending less and less due to them being a bigger brand."
2021-04-23 13:27:38,wallstreetbets,"Also. One of buffets rules if you want to call it that is that the company is reinvesting in itself. 

This can be looked at in a couple of ways. New tech? Advertising?

Just because a company has 95% revenue and isn’t profitable doesn’t mean shit. 

Where is the money going?  If it is reinvestment it is almost certainly a good thing."
2021-04-23 12:54:29,wallstreetbets,"Sir this is a Wendy's, where only the mightiest of retards survive. There will be casualties."
2021-04-23 14:23:17,wallstreetbets,"Come on, now. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, and every other large company with uber-name-brand recognition still blows megapiles of cash on advertising. Companies never spend less as they grow. At best, they're just spending a lower percentage of their revenue, but that's not necessarily true. It's not exactly cheap or pointless to put your name on a stadium, basketball arena, or to run Superbowl ads. They don't do it just because they can afford it.  


Advertising is an essential part of every business. Even companies like Raytheon and Northrop-Grumman do it, even though DoD contracts comprise nearly all of their revenue. The government doesn't need to be told who they are."
2021-04-23 14:45:02,wallstreetbets,"You're mixing-up your numbers. The claim is ""95% profit -- if you throw out their advertising and reinvestment."" Both of those are costs of doing business that may or may not pay off in the future, assuming you don't want your business to stagnate.  


They have to be done, but you don't get to count the expenditures as ""profit"". That's deceptive, at the very least."
2021-04-23 14:29:03,wallstreetbets,"But a lower % is still lower?

So that means that lower % would possibly make them profitable?


No one said advertising was pointless. 

How often you see blizzard or epic games commercials?

The point is this, if you invest you’re revenue back into the company then you multiply your chances of success. 

You telling me sklz isn’t profitable and they never will be? Even though they have 95% increase in revenue? That is a good thing. 

Btw. Up a dollar during this conversation"
2021-04-23 15:01:33,wallstreetbets,Well if someone claimed that they are wrong. It was a 95% increase in revenue.
2021-04-23 14:39:31,wallstreetbets,"I see ads for Blizzard all the time, as well as for other gaming companies (not so much for epic, in particular), and I don't even watch channels where their target audience dominates.  


And I never said SKLZ isn't profitable. Just that ""95% profit"" is a flat-out lie. Any company can inflate their profit margin if they throw out their advertising budget."
2021-04-23 15:08:22,wallstreetbets,">SKLZ has 95% profit margins. Yes.... NINETY FIVE %. Although they are not profitable yet (they reinvest all profits into marketing efforts for growth)

First sentence under ""#1"" in the OP.... That's what crawled up my crack in the first place..."
2021-04-23 14:41:57,wallstreetbets,"I agree then. 

Profit and revenue are two completely different things. 

Revenue is income earned

Profit is income after expenses(such as reinvestment,advertising, etc..)"
2021-04-23 15:22:32,wallstreetbets,Okay he is mistaken.
2021-04-23 15:51:25,wallstreetbets,I've actually seen it published elsewhere just like that. He must have copied & pasted it from some other source. Still... Wrong is wrong.
2021-04-23 15:54:51,wallstreetbets,This is true. 95% growth is still good though. If you are reinvesting. It seems like sklz is.
2021-04-23 19:06:11,wallstreetbets,"It's not 95% growth, though. They're just saying that for every $100 in revenue, they only spent $5 -- ignoring the fact that they spent more than the entire $100 on marketing and whatever else."

2021-04-23 14:55:44,wallstreetbets,"I've been AFK for a bit from the modchat and discord. They uncovered evidence that they're pretty sure makes MVIS a pump, something about emails being sent around from which DD is being copy+pasted here or something, and brigading. Idk the specifics, I'm out of the loop.

It turns out they were blocking that ticker sporadically yesterday (via automod) while trying to figure out what to do. Personally I think the right move would have been publicly saying something **first** then blocking it **second**, but I wasn't involved in the decision. I had about as much information as any of you had about it up until twenty minutes ago, which is a problem because how were you supposed to know why it was happening if I didn't either?

So no, my bots are not to blame. WSB is not fuk. It is not some nefarious conspiracy. It is not *hedge fund shilling*. The mods are not on the take. They're not pumping MVIS, they're not dumping MVIS. It has no relation to GME. It's just people being shortsighted and trying to do the right thing. Sorry for technically lying to a bunch of people yesterday saying ""omg we don't block MVIS"". **That part bothers me the most.**

I'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus, those dudes are my homies, I'm trying to stop the entire community from getting thrown under the bus by decent decisions made with terrible optics/implementation. We've already got enough conspiracy theory stuff being leveled at us without giving them more ammo by doing the right thing the wrong way. We very rarely block any ticker because.. y'know.. people thought GME was a pump too since people liked it. Just how it is. I can't even think of the last ticker we blocked.

EDIT: To be clear, I have no idea if MVIS will be considered spam or not, but that's what's been going on. And most of these angry replies are from people with a ton of history in the MVIS subreddit, which is kind of a problem in itself that I don't know how to handle.

**EDIT 2:** The issue isn't settled FYI. They're talking about it, I expect you'll either see what they considered when making the call yesterday or have it unblocked. I think if we're gonna do something like this what we have to show for it should withstand public scrutiny. We'll try to do it that way going forward."

2021-04-23 06:38:10,wallstreetbets,"Stock futures are a bit higher, with small caps leading the major indices. Russell 2000 is up 0.6%. Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all up about 0.2%. That’s as of 0630.

This follows a day of selling in reaction to President Biden’s “American Family Plan,” which is to be funded mainly by increasing the capital gains tax and the top income tax rate. Predictably, markets don’t like this plan very much.

It may not be relevant because it probably has little chance of passing through Congress. Too many Democrat senators are probably beholden to the financial sector for this to happen. And you only need one defection to kill it. More likely it will be watered down significantly. And even then it won’t affect most retail traders. The rich, meanwhile, will find loopholes. They always do.

So this is likely another market overreaction to news. It overshadows a day of mostly positive earnings results, though not from airlines (American and Southwest both fell short of estimates and their stocks sold off. They are rebounding in the premarket however).

Couple of earnings on tap today, led by American Express, Honeywell, and Kimberly Clark.

Still say things are set up pretty well for stocks to move higher, but you shouldn’t listen to me on that."

 M!¥i$skirt Boys.  She's Blowing!"
2021-04-23 13:19:29,wallstreetbets,"Why it's time to take your profit on OCGN:

I have been following OCGN for months when they initially partnered with Bharat Bioscience and was initially extremely bullish and rode OCGN from $6 to 16 the first time. After doing more DD, there are too many risks for OCGN to be valued at 2B.  


* OCGN only makes money on Covaxin vaccinations in the US
* The 70% efficacy is significantly below both Pfizer and Moderna, which we already mass producing enough of to cover the entire population forever
* They still need EUA approval, which will take several weeks if not months, as there would still need to be an independent trial conducted in the US
* By the time their vaccine is maybe approved, 80%+ of people in the US would already be vaccinated
* Covaxin takes a long time to manufacture and OCGN still needs to develop the manufacturing facilities in the US to even start manufacturing
* The price of vaccine is low, like $10-20 total, the small margins then are split among OCGN and Bharat Bioscience(the company who developed the vaccine)
* They only make 45% of profit per vaccination in the US, only place where they can sell it, which is about\~$5 They would need 25 Million vaccinations a year just to make 125M, not happening
* They had adverse reaction issues they swept under the rug in India in order to fast track this to market

TLDR Even if OCGN gets EUA, it will take too long for them to get the vaccine to market in the US, the margins will be low, the market will be saturated, and their efficacy is lower than American competitors. 

Positions: small short position of 300 shares, will add on as hype dies"

2021-04-23 15:23:30,wallstreetbets,So a skim through MVIS DD suggests potential LIDAR valuation that puts it in the price range of Velodyne and Luminar. There's hope for a buyout which would send the price north quite a bit. They pushed forward their earnings call and demo so there's that. Anything else I've missed?

Its been rejected at 19 since february 6 times. Before this recent run up it did double bottom so you have that going for you, but if you bought high especially over 14 you may get wrecked.

Idk shit about the company or why people are into it now. If it were me Id take some profits and see if it can gap above 19 monday or tuesday and hold it."

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **93.70** which gives us a total value of:

2021-04-23 10:47:02,wallstreetbets,"So short story! Last year i quit my job in industry to follow my dreams full time. My passion is music and i decided to follow that passion partially cause of the worldwide news coverage of the GME ""manipulation"" that u guys flared last year. This made me realize that we all have the power to play the game to our own end if we set our minds to it.  Whether it would be stock market, music market or job market etc. Shit its always some market.  We are all powered by the same source and that is life itself. It can all go away as quick as it came so stop blaming the game and just focus to play.  We can all feel better with the ability in all of us to make ourselves better each day just little by little and remember that we can always elevate ourselves and the power is in numbers. I love the fact that the hedge fund multi billionaires were trembling to the guys little and big when united. My songs lyrics are a big part for this power and all i can say is do more and [Game 0n!](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willjoy/game-0n-3) Or should i say [GME ON!](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/willjoy/game-0n-3)"

It's concerning the VXX that made almost 300% over night. So my question is: why did that happen?
Is it

1. The rollover effect to the next vix contract

In the boardroom, we are going to manage as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another squeeze. And that’s my mindset.”"

2021-04-23 13:54:24,wallstreetbets,Vice versa. MVIS will have more room to run
2021-04-23 14:26:56,wallstreetbets,Stop watching porn on it

2021-04-23 10:48:02,wallstreetbets,yeah and now shorts are all moving to lower market cap stock. WSB rules should be relaxed if there is good fundamentals for a stock.

2021-04-23 13:20:33,wallstreetbets,Make this a post. I may not agree with it but (1) the daily thread is not a good place for nuanced DD or discussion and (2) we need some proper non-GME DD out there

2021-04-23 10:23:30,wallstreetbets,Dude Mvis has been talked about for months here.  Its ran up over 20 already.  You get no credit.

2021-04-23 06:53:33,wallstreetbets,The semi index has been lagging. The market is bear curious overall. Put debit spreads imo. Earnings season has been a sell the news event so far with the exception of div stocks. That's my take. I think you could buy puts on every tech company the day before earnings and would have more than a 50% success rate.
2021-04-23 07:12:09,wallstreetbets,Go all in on GOEV.

2021-04-23 14:28:30,wallstreetbets,Well yeah they are expiring in like 1.5 hours ya dingus
2021-04-23 14:55:04,wallstreetbets,Look at the chart.. we already know the answer 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-23 15:39:27,wallstreetbets,News AH yesterday that earnings will be on Thursday. Indication the A-sample is done and could be a small update involved.
2021-04-23 15:39:55,wallstreetbets,Because you cant tell the future.
2021-04-23 06:42:25,wallstreetbets,It’s called the market sending a message. That’s all. Don’t overthink it.
2021-04-23 06:41:54,wallstreetbets,Dude. They're hammering the market as a show of force.
2021-04-23 06:42:44,wallstreetbets,"they know damn well it's not likely to pass and, considering this isn't the first time it was mentioned, this was probably already priced in

mm just throwing a financial temper tantrum, nothing to see here"
2021-04-23 06:48:41,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't need to make sense. If traders think there is a chance the market could go down, you go short or sell to get a better entry. That's why the stock market is so irrational. At any given time you have people trying to fk around with prices"
2021-04-23 06:55:02,wallstreetbets,"It makes perfect sense.  The floor fell out.  Yeah this is potentially the last year for capital gains ez mode riches, but with everyone taking money off the table early, are you going to buy the ""dip"" or wait for the new floor?

You'll get better ROI by owning businesses, land claims, and commodities.  There's already scarcity issues and not just semi chips."
2021-04-23 09:49:15,wallstreetbets,"I'm fully prolapsed.

5k more on standby waiting for a dip."
2021-04-23 07:08:53,wallstreetbets,we need taxes so we can funnel them into our friends companies

2021-04-23 07:26:19,wallstreetbets,I know I am!
2021-04-23 08:11:38,wallstreetbets,Need 1.7% on SPY
2021-04-23 11:30:18,wallstreetbets,Nope. Mandatory gay forever.
2021-04-23 10:46:55,wallstreetbets,They have not even announced earnings they literally moved up one week. No one moves up bad news. You right
2021-04-23 13:27:55,wallstreetbets,It's like this sub doesn't want to be about meme stocks anymore. Very confusing. Did Cramer buy WSB?
2021-04-23 13:27:43,wallstreetbets,just call it Mavis like the rest of us and stop being a baby
2021-04-23 09:07:15,wallstreetbets,"yeah, ""thinks"".  what the hell is that?"

2021-04-23 13:54:14,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure there was one DD on it a few months back but got absolutely no love because of the GME/AMC hype.
2021-04-23 10:22:01,wallstreetbets,What happened with GME. I havent seen a single comment about it in days
2021-04-23 10:46:19,wallstreetbets,SpaceX got MVIS onboard!
2021-04-23 17:03:42,wallstreetbets,"TBH cashed in @ 19 expecting a dropoff, saw the great support around 17. Think I'll jump back in on Monday, we'll see if everyone takes profit, or keeps it riding."
2021-04-23 16:47:36,wallstreetbets,"It smacked off the 19 resistance, like the last 3 times but this time there’s a boat load of momentum. I think we break past 20 imo. Next pt is 24 for me."
2021-04-23 09:26:23,wallstreetbets,"They will moon next week with earnings call, now is the time to get in!"
2021-04-23 09:26:37,wallstreetbets,People have bags are 20+ so anything under that is a buy for me given it’s valuation
2021-04-23 09:47:41,wallstreetbets,My buyout target is $50 to $60 but with WSB involved now who knows where it can be pushed to. I think with good PR on the 29th we could see a push to high 20's and that was before WSB interest.
2021-04-23 09:47:07,wallstreetbets,$25 by may minimum
2021-04-23 09:47:53,wallstreetbets,$70 target no less
2021-04-23 09:48:07,wallstreetbets,$80+ when buyout happens
2021-04-23 10:18:02,wallstreetbets,wont be one.  people now realize it's underpriced.  catalyst only 1-2 days away.  not enough time.  fomo in bro
2021-04-23 10:37:45,wallstreetbets,"Snipped mine a little early, but still profit none the less."
2021-04-23 12:06:02,wallstreetbets,The amount of times I could have made a good play but I keep putting capital in shit I don’t need it in :(

2021-04-23 10:50:13,wallstreetbets,The fact you made the stop loss that low. Sorry bud 😂😂😂
2021-04-23 13:46:37,wallstreetbets,"Dude it's like ""I can only afford 3 shares but thats okay because I'll be able to buy a house from it when it hits 100k per share"". I want to live on their level of ignorance for just a moment to know how it feels."
2021-04-23 07:36:41,wallstreetbets,"Tylenol' and ibuprofen, alternate taking them every 2 hours."
2021-04-23 07:35:42,wallstreetbets,I had the same and I felt like I had just been in Vegas for 4 days doing all nighters and coke.   After the second day I felt much better.  Make sure you drink plenty of fluids ape.

2021-04-23 11:50:00,wallstreetbets,I was in at $10.20. I’ve sold for profit and rebought .50 cents higher now twice. That’s a whole frickin dollar i missed out on. So I’m just holding now. Since I was originally playing it for the PR news and possible buy out before it really blew up. So I figure I may as well stick to my thesis. Do have some stop losses in place though.

LOL nice try man. Notice how its not dumping because its an actual play, not a ""squeeze"" play.  Have you done the DD?  Why do you believe their LIDAR is not worth this valuation? Why do you think the competition has a better play?"

2021-04-23 15:00:17,wallstreetbets,I have no fuggin idea. I left in annoyance but I wanted to say something about it. They can handle it now that the subject has been broached the correct way.
2021-04-23 15:03:50,wallstreetbets,"pushed back a week :*(. It's ok though, I really, really want that job, and I think I'm the dude to do it. I hope they'll agree."

2021-04-23 13:43:46,wallstreetbets,You are right.  I should just stick with spy. I've got to many tickers.  Until I get to that 25k mark I should keep it simple.  So many plays i want to just throw a few bucks at but it always gets me is oh there might be a better day trade. Then I miss out.
2021-04-23 12:43:54,wallstreetbets,how come? did i miss something that happened?
2021-04-23 14:06:23,wallstreetbets,Numbers came

2021-04-23 13:30:05,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s what I’m thinking though I do wonder how badly I’ll get IV crushed. I think AMD can get back to 90 though if earnings are good which is probably more likely than not. PE is starting to look good for a semiconductor lol
2021-04-23 13:34:54,wallstreetbets,Fake dip at that

2021-04-23 11:14:18,wallstreetbets,Thinking about it.  IV is still sorta high.
2021-04-23 10:21:36,wallstreetbets,13% gains in less than an hour I’d say is worthwhile. Plus I was playing in my boomer account.

2021-04-23 10:13:04,wallstreetbets,Same. Salty I could’ve got more but with 0dte and tsla’s swings being volatile af took my gains and dipped. First time a tsla call actually went my way 😂

2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Investing with Lil Boat, DD based on the album. Yachty killed the coins when he dropped Michigan Boy Boat and tomorrow he's coming for the SPY. The album is filled with DD. Here's my review:

Track 3 - **Concrete Goonies** \- Invest in infrastructure.

Track 5 - **G.I. Joe** \- Long RTX, LTM, BA, DFEN, NOC. This is an obvious play you shouldn't need Yachty to elucidate for you.

Track 6 - **Never Did Coke** \- This is a short play on KO. Yachty thinks kids are more health conscious now, but his bearish sentiment on Coke long-term confuses me. I think they're well positioned for some CBD beverages and healthy drinks.

Track 8 - **Plastic** \- Long oil. This is a recovery play.

Track 12 - **SB5** \- If you google SB5 you get PROFUTURA. This is a bullish Latina futures play. GPROFUT

Track 13 - **Hybrid** \- He's saying short Tesla, as he prefers a hybrid to a full electric. Yachty is bullish on Detroit automakers. He seems to suggest he's made quite the bag off GM and FORD this year while fucking your little sister.

Overall, Yachty invests like a boomer, which is telling. I agree with some of his observations and will be adjusting my portfolio as needed. I give it a Strong 7 weak 8."
2021-04-23 02:03:24,wallstreetbets,I don't find this any more insane than the usual DD around here.
2021-04-23 03:19:10,wallstreetbets,"I saw Yachty live once, summer that Lil Boat came out. It was in Queens at Studio Square. They were selling blue drinks there were straight alcohol and there were high school kids throwing up in the corners with blue tongues. Yachty came out looking like Gordons fisherman in those yellow fishing overalls. I was on two tabs and it was pretty magical watching everyone party to some lullaby trap.

When Migos were about to come on, the crowd got crazy. Beautiful expensive women came out of the woodwork. All ass and tits and lips. Then they started making gunshot noises and the cops showed up and kicked everyone out. Spent the rest of the night on the docks in LI city watching Manhattan breathe in the distance tripping balls. We ran into a little spanish street party, with music and food, right near the water. I can still remember the smell of the carnitas hitting. You rarely get hungry tripping but that shit got me straight aroused.

When the man drops an album, I buy puts. Good luck everybody."
2021-04-23 02:28:08,wallstreetbets,I think all these plays are his victims. While i completely agree with the analysis i believe inversing these plays are the actual message. Yachty is a boat. Boats go in the ocean. Plastic is polluting the ocean. Yachty is comin for oil. Puts on XOM.

2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry's patent value and overnight stock to $40 Blackberry today owns 38,000 patents in encryption, wireless, hardware phones, messaging.

JC at last conference call said he's in discussion to sell ""MOST"" of the patents...that equates to minimum of 20,000 patents.

1. Aol sold 800 patents for $1.1billion ([here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303815404577333323756192742)) or $1.4 mil per patent  
2. kodak sold 1,100 patents for $500 million ([here](https://www.wired.com/2012/12/kodak-patents/))  or $500,000 per patent
3. Motorola sold 7,500 patents for $4 bill ([here)](https://gigaom.com/2014/01/30/google-paid-4b-for-patents-why-the-motorola-deal-worked-out-just-fine/) or $533,000 per patent
4. nokia is around \~$700,000 per patent

We know that messaging and phone hardware patents are critical to following companies (google, fb, snap, twitter, apple, etc). 

We also know 2,000 companies are infringing on blackberry patents ([here](https://www.greyb.com/blackberry-patents-infringement-potential/)). So whoever is the buyer of blackberry patent will have a **choke hold** on **big US tech companies.** WE know apple and fb has a fight going on....think game theory here folks. 

&#x200B;

So 20,000 patents at say lower end of average of $500,000 is **$10,000,000,0000**.   
or  
at higher end 20k patents for $1million is **$20,000,000,000**. 

I think the patent porfolio will go between $12-$15 billion. 

&#x200B;

**At $15 billion sale, that's $30 per share cash!!** Add to current stock price we hit **$40 overnight**!!!

50 million share shorted of 250million retail float...we will hit $75 within few months of patent sale!!! 

Blackberry Spark is the future cybersecurity platform for all iot (computers, phones, drones, trains, cars, traffic light, meters, smart cities)

QNX embedded for all iot devices. 

Not a investment advice but just my due diligence and research on blackberry and patents. "
2021-04-23 02:25:23,wallstreetbets,Definitely over simplified. That’s not even missing the trees in the forest. This is just straight staring at bark.
2021-04-23 08:18:11,wallstreetbets,"Naaah.  From my understanding $BB's value will hit the $20+ mark once they transition to subscription based models for IVY and their cyber security suites.  Right now its a one time buy. Earliest we see that is 2022 if they get IVY into the pipeline buy end of 2021.  Let this sit at 8-10.  Im using BB as a savings account to scoop up shares here and there for a long term hold.  

Holding 605 shares"
2021-04-23 02:05:06,wallstreetbets,"Most Blackberry patents are old and about to expire, which greatly reduces the usefulness and value since any moat they provide effectively disappears when the patent does."
2021-04-23 05:48:44,wallstreetbets,"What on earth? There's not a chance on hell the patents are worth anywhere even approaching $10bn.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BB.TO/balance-sheet/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BB.TO/balance-sheet/)

Non-current assets (things like patents) are valued by BB at $1.8bn. Even assuming a 50% purchasing premium all non-current assets (which won't only be patents) are valued at like $2.7bn. And a 50% premium is not likely.

Why the hell wouldn't whoever is buying the ""$12-15bn"" patent portfolio **just buy the company** considering market cap is $4.8bn and that would buy **everything** BB has?

And Motorola sold 17k patents + 7500 applications, not 7500, Kodak isn't a comparable company (how are image processing patents similar to BBs patent portfolio?) You've not provided any source for Nokia's patent value but considering they're likely patents in 5G infrastructure they're going to be valued high and AOL sold patents for things like online advertising which would obviously attract high values - and isn't something BB deals in.

Not to mention you're just so far off on everything else too, Blackberry Spark is no revolutionary piece of software. Microsoft, VMware, IBM all have better UEM products.

QNX is not embedded in all IOT devices.

Just admit you're holding bags, stop trying to create this false presumption that BB is this sleeping giant tech company."
2021-04-23 07:31:56,wallstreetbets,"Just why? Why does everyone suddenly think that their patent portfolio isnt valued correctly by the company itself or that all of the patents are still relevant and not impaired in anyway? Also, BB's market cap would make it way more feasible for a buyout assuming one entity wanted the entire portfolio. This is not at all how patents relate to valuation"
2021-04-23 08:08:53,wallstreetbets,This is some military grade hopium right here. Dont you know that $BB is cursed?

2021-04-23 02:46:10,wallstreetbets,I almost believed you but hen you have -33 comment karma. 😷
2021-04-23 02:25:19,wallstreetbets,"The 10k has the patents FMV at 2B. Comparing different patent sales based upon number of patents does not equal fair market without knowing the utility of the comparable patent sales.

Now I'm not saying the 2B number is accurate either as that is likely to be a fictitious number made by an accountant and even alludes to such in the 10k by making the statement that they took an impairment solely due to the trading price of the stock.

So I do think it's more then 2B, but I don't quite consider 12B to be a likely accurate number either.

Now that won't get paid to shareholders but will pay down debt.

Less debt will mean higher eps but I don't see any valuation here whatsoever.

I would like to know if selling parts of the company could lessen debt payments enough that they are making a profit and if so how much?

Last Q they lost over $1 per share."

2021-04-23 08:05:01,wallstreetbets,"you analysis is flawed, you cannot arbitrarily give a value to each patent, like they are a subscriber to a phone company.  each patent has a different value, based on expiration date as well as usefulness.  if you are right, why have they not been able to monetize, also are these patents exclusive, or are some already covered in a licensing agreement.  

also the patent prices you stated in the above, have the buyers been able to get the ROC with the patent purchase?"

Completely ridiculous to assume these patents are worth the same as other companies patents because of... Abosultely nothing? The vast majority of these patents are probably worthless unviable garbage. There might be a few hundred high value patents in there. Anyway, patents are an asset to a business, and asset value will be on a balance sheet"

2021-04-23 02:28:23,wallstreetbets,"And in tech, a patent that's close to expiration is often already worthless as it's extremely outdated tech.  Patents are good for about ~~15~~ 20 years, meaning any expiring this year received their patent in ~~2006~~ 2001, and the underlying tech would have been developed in the preceding years.

I don't anticipate Biden/Dems being out in 4 years either, so this company that was favored by the Obama administration, now has friends in high places again, working out infrastructure for the next 8-10 years.

2021-04-23 02:50:48,wallstreetbets,This. Patents are already priced in and captured in their balance sheet under intangible assets. Selling them won’t increase the total asset for the company. They may want to sell patents that are no longer relevant to raise additional cash to fund other R&Ds and software developments.

2021-04-23 08:36:10,wallstreetbets,"You went with an average based on other patent sales for other companies and inferred that was what they would get on the sale of their patents. That’s like picking up 5 objects from in your home and saying that the average Facebook market sale value is $100, therefore your portfolio of items from in your house is worth $500. So if you picked up a broom, a garbage can and 3 apple cores, you might have a bit of a hard time selling for $500.

Similarly, with patents, not all of them are valuable and you can’t take an average and assume that would apply to each individual one.

Also, if you believe markets are efficient, then the current market value of the patent is embedded into the stock price and likely it would be the delta between what was embedded vs. the sale price."
2021-04-23 10:04:02,wallstreetbets,"Your post had a very compelling title. But if you’re going to say something so grand as “overnight to $40”, you had better back it up with some substance.

Valuation of a company is a much more complicated issue than taking the market value of possibly similar patents and applying to all the patents BB owns. It’s possible (Pareto principle) that only 20 of these patents hold ANY market value, let alone your $500k valuation."

2021-04-23 15:06:38,wallstreetbets,"I mean my first response would be, what moment did BB get under Obama? The share price peaked before Obama was President, never recovered, and was trading at current prices when he left? Unless you believe Biden for some reason has some raging hard-on for BB that doesn't breach any conflict of interest or doesn't damage his reputation, I can't see why a Biden administration would favour BB massively. I also don't really see how BB would have friends in high places - where? John Chen's only been CEO since 2013, so for half the Obama presidency (and after BBs peak relevancy). And how would those friends in high places be any different to the friends any powerful CEO would have? I imagine Bill Gates/Satya Nadella and the rest of Microsoft could sway the US government far more effectively.

I know Obama used to use a BB phone, but he switched during his presidency, and I can't find what phone Biden uses. Additionally BB doesn't really make phones anymore so I can't see how it'd be too helpful. Might benefit TCL if the licensed BB phones are still in use. So I don't think there's even a serious reputational bonus for BB in the US government.

I mean obviously it's pure speculation talking about FB/Google etc, but until we start seeing serious repercussions for data leaks does it really matter? The whole cambridge analytica scandal cost FB $5bn, nothing. Data leak the other day affected over 500mn people and there's not much talk of serious repercussions. They can get grilled all they want they won't stop until there is serious consequences, and tbh I don't see Biden delivering that.

Talking of SolarWinds - you know the US government hasn't even announced they'll stop using SolarWinds, let alone the myriad of other suppliers like VMware, Cisco, Crowdstrike, Microsoft, GrammaTech, etc etc? I'd stake a bet that BB might be able to take advantage in a small way and get some more security contracts, but until I see that the US government is seriously thinking of shifting its cybersecurity outsourcing to BB I'm not going to believe it."

I think many of the large tech companies made their software adapting from BB's, and I think that's where the grilling and patents are going to intersect, especially when it comes to the amount of data collection and mishandling.  This is where I think they are going to have another moment and make some kind of resurgence.  It might all go nowhere, but they've a good track record when it comes to security, and that's valuable these days."

2021-04-23 09:37:36,wallstreetbets,"Yup, it is rare for patents so close to expiration to be massively infringed. Not impossible, but definitely rare.

In my experience, the best window for licensing, litigating, or selling tech patents is around 8 or so years after filling. You still have 12ish years of life left so there can be significant damages, and if the tech is worth something the industry will have advanced and adopted it over those 8 years"
2021-04-23 14:39:48,wallstreetbets,In terms of tech like this as well honestly patents are just less valuable upon creation due to the speed in tech over time.
2021-04-23 15:50:02,wallstreetbets,"I don't really get what you're on about. Yes at one point in time the US government quite frequently used blackberry phones. But so did most of the world, and then blackberry phones became irrelevant. And that was in the early Obama presidency? Why wouldn't the moment have happened when blackberry was actually popular in the government 10 years ago rather than now? It seems like a massive stretch to think a resurgence would happen because phones were used 10 years ago, especially when BB doesn't produce phones anymore.

Patents are largely being sold off, so I don't really see how they're relevant either.

And honestly, you're far more optimistic than I if you think some grilling by congress towards huge tech companies is going to change anything. It's been happening for years and nothing has changed. Why would you assume after Cambridge Analytica, or Solar Winds, or any of the many many huge cyber and data breaches in the last few years that anything will change?

Truthfully as well, a lot of BBs cybersecurity suite isn't massively innovative. For instance, Spark is a decent UEM, sure, but Microsoft/VMware/Cisco all have larger and better competitors."

2021-04-23 16:11:19,wallstreetbets,">Why would you assume after Cambridge Analytica, or Solar Winds, or any of the many many huge cyber and data breaches in the last few years that anything will change?

Because the last 4 years were in direct correlation to unfettered cyber attacks, misinformation campaigns, and stripping and deregulating securities.

Patents are being sold off, have we even heard for how much yet?  I imagine when whales like FB buy it they pay big moneys.  And if some whales are found to have infringed upon patents when developing their platforms, I'd think restitutions might be in order, and I think there are these cases.

So why a resurgence?  Well, all this traction and spotlighting helping hype the launching of IVY."

2021-04-23 16:57:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the last 4 years has been rife with cyber attacks, deregulation, misinformation, unethical data stealing. But what is actually changing? As far as I'm aware FB hasn't been broken up or punished by Biden. Or punished by consumers.

Patents are worth under $1.8bn  according to the latest BB balance sheet, under non-current assets. There's usually a price premium on these sorts of things but it's not at all going to be big money in the grand scheme of things. A very optimistic guess would be 3bn I'd say, more realistic is 2-2.5bn.

Patent infringement from FB/Snap was settled in January, restitutions probably would've appeared in the end of feb accounts, so again, not going to be a lot. 

I mean, I don't really see much more of a hype around IVY. Institutional investors don't seem impressed yet and no offense but 99% of BB fans on WSB spout the same bullshit over and over again. There's really not much traction that I see - like I said, BB phones were relevant in the US government 10 years ago, things have moved on. Until IVY (or any other product) starts showing serious results I don't see why there'd be any upswing."

2021-04-23 18:35:14,wallstreetbets,"What is actually changing.... I get the sense a lot is changing come 5g.  I don't see the world interested in letting FB and the like off with light slaps on the wrist either, too much evidence that has been the cost of business isn't actually serving as a deterrent, and it's got the general public in a mood demanding transparency and accountability (which might just lead to patent infringements).  I think with the post pandemic world shaping up, BB has many optional roles they'll be able to take advantage of and have a name in good favor.  I wonder if their price has been depressed for a long time, given how much others generated from BB's intellectual property, and IF there are possible catalysts on the horizon like restitutions or new ventures.  I know people have the 'show me' approach before investing, and I suspect that's how you are with IVY, smart and respectable, however this is a Wendy's, and here we also buy the rumor and sell the news, so >$9 for the IVY rumors seems like a decent bottom. It may fall lower too, but I do predict by the time IVY news is actually flowing $9 will have been a value."

2021-04-23 19:36:31,wallstreetbets,"Eh, I think people have argued that the public will get fed up with data breaches and big tech for years, and yet there's not been any significant decline in usage of Apple/FB/Insta/Snap/Twitter/Google whatever. I think the significant luxury benefit of having these things will always outweigh the vague threat of what big tech can and will do to your data.

As far as BB patent revenue goes - they do actually license them out. It pulls in I think roughly $350mn a year? It's an okay revenue driver, but honestly not anything significant. They're also looking to sell a lot of these patents, and realistically there's a price cap on these - there's no way BB can make more than $4bn or so, any higher and it'd be easier for the purchasing party to just acquire the company and take the patents. Even $4bn isn't a lot of money, it's like two weeks of revenue for FB, one and a bit weeks for Google. Restitutions are already likely paid out, and revenue will drop after patents are sold as BB won't be able to license. Could easily see a share price dip after that.

I think IVY is the shining star in BBs portfolio, but tbh it's nothing new - connected car systems/vehicle data platforms are owned by other company from big tech like Google/Microsoft to startups like Otonomo. IVY has an advantage in that currently QNX is a big OS in the automotive industry, but with companies like Tesla/VW (biggest future EV players) either running or planning to run their own OS, there's not a load of incentive to choose IVY over other platforms. Cars with IVY embedded won't ship until 2023 though, so I think I'll have a lot of time at roughly this price point to consider a buy in. Possibly a LEAP for 2023."

Or you’re just retarded and in that case you need to go get checked for that too. I literally brought up the fact they don’t use that shit anymore and still use IE and you said they still did lol
2021-04-23 08:21:46,wallstreetbets,"Saying every officer is issued a BB and nothing else has been wrong for the last 9 years.

Your original statement, fair enough, that was right. But saying that the military only gets issued BB phones now is just wrong."

2021-04-23 01:57:20,wallstreetbets,SKLZ ? I’m still trying to wrap my head around there being more than 2 stocks on the market besides gme and amc.... is this really true or just a rumor
2021-04-23 03:31:02,wallstreetbets,Still on gme
2021-04-23 02:54:32,wallstreetbets,To be fair Skillz had the highest trade volume on US exchanges but also to be fair when Nio was exploding from $3 to $40s and was the top traded stock in volume on US exchanges over weeks CNBC refused to even put the company’s name on the screen.
2021-04-23 01:17:56,wallstreetbets,"CNBC in kahoots with a big tech firm to drive our value down for certain 

smh"
2021-04-23 02:39:36,wallstreetbets,What the fuck are these guys talking about.
2021-04-23 01:36:15,wallstreetbets,MVIS is the Tesla of little tiny laser scanners

2021-04-23 14:56:22,wallstreetbets,"So, I bought some shares in $MVIS. I already own $SKLZ. Let's get these two to the moon."
2021-04-23 01:28:32,wallstreetbets,"They pushed the same lies with silver back when gme initially took off. And look at these bozos they're interviewing. This is DD according to cnbc? _Duhhh uhh volume high, deep end, chart go up!_"

Still poor but rich for me. Thanks redit!"
2021-04-23 02:23:52,wallstreetbets,SKLZ sounds just like another silver push 👎
2021-04-23 02:22:00,wallstreetbets,Haven't heard about this one. Fuck i hate the media.
2021-04-23 01:40:18,wallstreetbets,Well but I need MIcrovision for my micropenis so I invested in it 😁
2021-04-23 08:41:29,wallstreetbets,Some communities are involved in this though I'd say it's more a mix of retail in general and cathie but who knows other institutes may be involved. I've also certainly seen SKLZ mentioned on here yesterday as it ran up.
2021-04-23 09:42:52,wallstreetbets,I just hope CNBC picks this up so we get CNBC covering WSB covering CNBC covering WSB
2021-04-23 09:57:12,wallstreetbets,If you are listening to CNBC for stock advice.. you have a serious problem.
2021-04-23 11:55:43,wallstreetbets,Bought SKLZ a month ago. It's been a struggle but nice to see the high volume and a couple green days.
2021-04-23 10:35:09,wallstreetbets,"No, they didn't claim we were talking about Skillz.  You really need to work on comprehension.  They're being slippery, yes, but that's just how the media rolls and has for awhile now.  They are proposing Skillz as something they believe is a possible 'next target' for WSB.  They are assuming that they have identified what WSB likes in a stock and trying to get ahead of the subreddit.  They will, of course, fail spectacularly, as we all pivot into fursuit futures."
2021-04-23 11:16:26,wallstreetbets,SKLZ is on fire!
2021-04-23 12:13:07,wallstreetbets,The squeeze is on.
2021-04-23 19:52:32,wallstreetbets,They’re just trying to steer us away from MVIS since their last attempt with Cramer backfired lol

2021-04-23 11:14:02,wallstreetbets,... people on reddit can talk about multiple things simultaneously.  plenty of talk about sklz in the last few days.
2021-04-23 16:28:58,wallstreetbets,I glanced at this headline and bought 106 shares of MVIS. Was that the right one to buy? Or is it skillz?
2021-04-23 10:32:06,wallstreetbets,MVIS to the 🌙
2021-04-23 06:53:38,wallstreetbets,What the flyin fuck is SKLZ?
2021-04-23 09:55:04,wallstreetbets,Go go go SKLZ
2021-04-23 03:20:44,wallstreetbets,MVIS is only talked about here mate.
2021-04-23 18:46:59,wallstreetbets,I’m in on both MVIS and SKLZ
2021-04-23 05:41:18,wallstreetbets,It takes no skillz to lie.
2021-04-23 10:21:51,wallstreetbets,Why do people still watch the news... i mean propaganda lie factory
2021-04-23 11:55:45,wallstreetbets,They seem so depressed that young people have figured out how to stick it to the man!  They keep shorting we keep squeezing fuck em all
2021-04-23 14:46:28,wallstreetbets,I wonder what TD Ameritrade would think of how their sponsor dollars are being spent.
2021-04-23 15:23:32,wallstreetbets,$sklz When we say to the moon...whats the target price point??

2021-04-23 18:05:48,wallstreetbets,Karen is packing. I had no idea. Must be why they always show her from the neck up

It's moving up because cathie wood bought it.

But OK... Literally everything is a ""reddit short squeeze now""

Other than cathie wood being long, and the NFL deal, which doesn't look fucking solid, I don't see anything in this company, and it has slowing growth.

If it shoots up, good put play. This shit should be a $3B stock at best. Not $7B."
2021-04-23 02:19:49,wallstreetbets,"Look at their fake smiles. Lol when we say MVIS will moon, what range are we looking at.

I want to roll 2K into this in the AM? Can someone suggest a play (shares and a few calls)?"
2021-04-23 06:03:06,wallstreetbets,"We are in MVIS, silly boomers lulz"
2021-04-23 06:48:56,wallstreetbets,I don’t like this stock.
2021-04-23 09:31:01,wallstreetbets,SKLZ 🚀
2021-04-23 10:04:41,wallstreetbets,Probably the best campaign yet to get us off GME and AMC.
2021-04-23 10:13:35,wallstreetbets,"Just for fun, bought 100 shares early today. There was a lot of crazy price movements. So after about 15 minutes sold it for $56 profit. Now, I can afford to buy my wife's boyfriend a cup of coffee. (I hope he chokes on it.)"
2021-04-23 12:02:35,wallstreetbets,"Why not short squeeze sklz? If there is a heggie to fuck, I'm in."
2021-04-23 12:08:37,wallstreetbets,I own shares in skillz. Let's do it.
2021-04-23 12:13:43,wallstreetbets,This isn't GME VS SKLZ is it?  This is us Vs them. No need to shit on SKLZ. If it's primed to squeeze let it be so. Make $ on it to buy more GME - AMC. Food for thought.
2021-04-23 01:22:30,wallstreetbets,"Hmm . I just looked it up , MVIS has a short interest ratio of 23 percent while SKLZ has a short interest of 28 percent . Volume in SKLZ Is like 3.5 times higher too . I didn’t know about this , I only have positions in MVIS."
2021-04-23 08:06:45,wallstreetbets,Gme all day
2021-04-23 03:28:13,wallstreetbets,$SKLZ. There is a big game with this stock. Look the volume
2021-04-23 02:46:10,wallstreetbets,They're trying anything to get the attention away from AMC/GME. They should know by now that shyt don't work no more!
2021-04-23 03:11:00,wallstreetbets,Gme only
2021-04-23 02:37:42,wallstreetbets,"SLVR - RKT - MVIS. All the same shit. People getting messages from these “marketing firms” about getting paid to post. And boom, all of a sudden these sellouts make these “amazing stocks” the hot topic. 

The magic actually happens somewhere else while you’re being distracted by something else."
2021-04-23 07:55:52,wallstreetbets,It amazes me how they can act like professionals and be so stupid. They've apparently done zero research on the stock beforehand. I was in SKLZ before this move and it is definitely undervalued with a lot of short attacks recently. This push up is totally justified with or without reddit traders.
2021-04-23 17:07:33,wallstreetbets,GME was fun while it lasted. Great short term play on the gamma squeeze but it has zero catalyst. MVIS has a shit ton of catalyst through the rest of the year. We cud literally gamma squeeze this until the company gets bought out. It has a strong base of OG’s and the tech is disruptive. THIS IS THE WAY!!
2021-04-23 14:56:30,wallstreetbets,"MVIS the next GME . 28,000,000  short shares ! That’s right 28 million shares being shorted right now ! Massive squeeze has begun !"
2021-04-23 02:35:01,wallstreetbets,People only talking about MV IS because they’re being paid to and sent a script about it all
2021-04-23 10:08:50,wallstreetbets,Why you guys act like you forgot about GME
2021-04-23 01:34:59,wallstreetbets,"I put $9.4 trillion in SKLZ, no really, like f’real yo, maw fo show 🤫

Edit 😉"
2021-04-23 03:10:54,wallstreetbets,Literally everyone? Are you literally retarded?
2021-04-23 07:55:40,wallstreetbets,$Sklz is salty because they had a run up on their deal with the NFL then you find out the company is actually crap. Price drops and now they’re trying to find new momentum. 🙄
2021-04-23 09:34:29,wallstreetbets,"They’re trying to distract the idiots from MVIS lol it isn’t working. Let’s talk about the facts. The great news is on its way. The offers are on the table. The earnings report will be first positive ever. No insiders selling. You do the math. And if every short position gets covered 100%, the stock will be above $50-75 per share. MVIS Gang!

Honestly do the math yourself before you judge me, do your OWN DD. This company is fucking valuableable if, you can’t see it- go to an ophthalmologist. I’m not a financial advisor and I can’t support anyone if they go broke yoloing into this stock. I own 2,200 shares of this bad boy"
2021-04-23 10:04:34,wallstreetbets,I hope MVIS breaks 20 instead os SKILLZ

Even better - it was when silver deliveries were at their absolute highest meaning shorting silver was a 99.9999% chance of losing money.

2021-04-23 06:35:20,wallstreetbets,bs? The value is there. Young generation definitely doesn’t want to buy mortgages through in-office consultation with boomers. They want to open their iPhone and do it in 5 mins from their home.

2021-04-23 10:43:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's sad when people just straight up fall for the D-class manipulation the media pulls.  Hard to be on the side of the public when they just lean into their intuition and never examine anything for what it actually is.  CNBC either thinks they have identified 'what Reddit likes' or, perhaps, thinks they can drive it.  In either case, they're full of garbage, and people who watch it thinking 'this is what Reddit is going for now' or 'look at what they are saying Reddit is going for now' are all falling for their low-rent manipulation.  It's just insulting on all fronts."

MSFT buyout will focus on AR, which will discount value of car sensors. LIDAR isn't the dominant tech for cars due to limitations, so will be used in conjunction with other tech. It's also used in OEM fashion, so manufacturers won't pay full cost. Most DD says 4 sensors at 1000, it's really like 1 at 250.

AR buyout on normal buyout metrics puts it at like $1B. Value to MSFT puts it at about $2B. Stand alone company also leaves it at about $1B.

$10 a share says MSFT is likely buying the company for $12-14 a share. $14 a share says a bunch of people FOMOd in on DD with crazy valuation."

I tried to refinance with them early 2020.. it all look good. Rates were cool... very fast closing times. The one thing that turned me off was their closing costs. They wanted to add another 13,000 on my loan balance-- that's not including title & escrow fees, prepaid taxes, interest, credit report fee, appraisal fee, etc. I asked them why we would get charged so much? We had credit scores above 800, plenty of income and assets, steady employment-- although our LTV was 85%, I didn't see how a $13,000 charge was justified. I pointed that out to them and asked them if we could waive the points being charged, they said, ""No."" I kindly declined. 2 months later, I refinanced with another broker where I paid a total of $1500 in closing costs, no appraisal needed-- and we got a better rate.

Expected to beat all metrics according to CEO. He said in CC last month ""There is no Competition"". Ususally pushing forward earnings date is sign of good news.  they cant wait to tell?

Looking at the Lidar field overall we see that Luminar is currently in the lead with a Market Cap of 6.5B. If MVIS Lidar meets expectations(which we have seen no indication otherwise). Then I would expect this to push us a lot closer to or over Luminar Market cap. PPS target about $42. So even if it falls short off of initial news we should be in $35 range. once any announcements of deals come out then I would expect the rise to continue.

Besides this there are other Verticles to consider. NED (near eye display) Engine used in Microsofts Hololense 2 is MVIS tech which we receive royalties from. The NED contract does not have exclusivity and could see others utilizing our tech. (speculated that upcoming Niantic VR glasses use our NED).

Rate/Risk management is the true concern.  

Do you have to put your SSN in there and a credit check?  Do you need an appraisal on the property?  Do you still need proof of income?   

If that's still in there and the risk management is properly managed in the back of house, then this shouldn't be a concern.   What's the average credit rating of the loans?   Default rates?  

If they are doing it right, a shitty borrower gets a higher rate to offset the risk on the loan and taken as an aggregate that can be a reward in profits.  Those loans also need to be offset with quality, to maintain the underlying business if the wendy's employees default.  Having an easy button for a mortgage doesn't imply that everyone gets approved, or that the quality isn't there.

The Four-Pillar Strategy to Deliver Long-Term Profitable Growth

Our long-term corporate strategy rests on four pillars:

1. Optimize the Core: Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization, including cost restructuring, inventory management optimization, adding and growing high margin product categories, and rationalizing the global store base.

2. Become the Social / Cultural Hub for Gaming: Create the social and cultural hub of gaming across the GameStop platform and offerings.

3. Build a Frictionless Digital Ecosystem: Develop and deploy a frictionless consumer facing digital omnichannel environment, including the recent relaunch of [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com), to reach customers more broadly across all channels and provide them the full spectrum of content and access to products they desire, anytime, anywhere.

4. Transform Vendor Partnerships: Transform our vendor and partner relationships to unlock additional high margin revenue streams and optimize the lifetime value of every customer."

2021-04-23 18:32:03,wallstreetbets,"This is clearly a personal opinion, but in general RKT serves low information mortgage customers and takes advantage of those people. There really is no such thing as a “instant” mortgage like they claim. They don’t have their customers best interests at heart, and do not provide any of the consultation services that many good mortgage brokers provide. It’s a much more nuanced business than people think and represents the single most important financial investment that an individual can make.. RKT doesn’t provide the nuance for people in any way shape or form. Peoples debts scenario’s can be quite fluid and varied, if you want bespoke and true customer service, NEVER USE RKT. Now as a stock, the story is different in regards to mass, if inefficient and boiler plate service, but large sales numbers. Do pay close attention to the rates though.. There was a refi rate boom in 2020 and in many places they have ground to halt with the new administration and bond yields. Purchases are the name of the game now, but there is no inventory in a lot of places. Some relatively small towns that would have hundreds of offerings on the market are now down to 50 listings or less. Everything sells that quickly, which if you are a RKT client that’s great, but the competition between realtors for purchase is skyrocketing and someone will definitely be left behind."

Hi, dear wsbros,

This is my first WSB post, and I wanted to share my analysis regarding every man’s best friend, Viatris. You know, that company makes that erection pill. Viatris is a roll-off/merge of Pfizer and Mylan. I owned this stock since day one because I have been holding PFE since the pandemic (a pretty lucky bet, nobody knew they would develop the best vaccine at that time).

I was legit like, “Hey, get-hard pill, I guess I will hold it so I can buy them pills with the dividends,” but since the last crash in late February (around 28%), I have been paying extra attention. I’ve put my eyes on it since then, and I think right now is a great time to purchase with very low risk.

# Fundamentals

All my friends call me a boomer for a reason; I always look at the fundamentals first (Warren Buffet is my daddy). I am sure you guys have your way to do more research, so I will provide a guideline to stimulate your ape brain.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6xnbxzsovuu61.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e30fe4232ed3cf11d3bbd34ccf3a19798ff48dd

PFE has created VTRS for a very clear purpose: a total package from Pfizer’s already-lost-exclusivity drugs. Therefore, it’s not supposed to be a growth stock but rather a cash cow waiting to be milked till its death. PFE’s current dividend yield is 4.04%, and it’s not hard to expect that VTRS will have a similar dividend yield once it settles down all the aftermath of M&A and operation optimization. It is expected to generate dividends as early as mid-2022. Buying VTRS now is like buying Coca-Cola 30 years ago (yes, again, Warren Buffet is my daddy). And every man eventually needs a little bit of help.

The current valuation is extremely undervalued. You should be able to read it yourself from your favorite website. Several KPIs

* Estimated P/E: 3.74 (the industry average is 53.13)
* Gross Margin: 57.87% (the industry average is 38.83%)
* Total Debt/Equity: 109.13% (the industry average is 148.33%)

So again, it’s undervalued, high quality, financially healthy, but not much growth potential. It’s criminally undervalued, and it’s fair to say that this can be your 401k/piggy bank when you retire (if you ever want to, or capitalism still stands).

# Technicals

* It went above the previous support level ($13.32) today (currently priced at $13.36).
* It crossed above the 20 SMA during the day.
* RSI went below 30 10 days ago, but now it’s above 40.
* It has been oversold, according to RSI, basically since late February.

# Cost

Because of its recent oversold rally, it’s very cheap to make ITM calls. I made a LEAPS call today.

I paid $3.60 for VTRS $10 17 DEC 21 Call 100. Therefore, my IV is less than 27%, with a Delta of .9260 and a Theta of -.0010.

It was an unreal experience. I purchased the LEAPS calls (10 contracts), and I made around 20% within 7 minutes. Today, I ended up making 26.39% with $950.

# Conclusion

I am a very conservative investor. I only allocated less than 10% of the portfolio into the VTRS calls and also owned the stock. In the world of meme stock and growth stocks, we sometimes overlook the more conservative picks; but who cares, right? It makes us them tendies. I am planning to purchase next week once I liquidate some of my assets. Thank you for reading! I will try my best to answer any questions if you guys are interested.

# Edit Update (4/23/2021)
Hi folks, I wrote this post half asleep last night, and I did not expect to get this much response for my very first post. I really appreciate it except you ape trolls but still love ya. I got several similar questions, so I am going to write a quick summary:
* I do own a significant amount of shares of VTRS. I’ve had PFE since a year ago (I bought PFE only because I thought it was better than buying a treasury note lol. Nobody knew PFE would develop the Covid vaccine back then!). Therefore, I actually have owned VTRS since its birth.
* I have been slowly buying up more and more VTRS over time. According to my WeBull, around 14% of my portfolio is in VTRS. I am very long in this stock for a very clear cash generating purpose.
* The reason why I bought this LEAPS call is because the moment hit the bottom and cost was very cheap to purchase the LEAPS call. IV of 27%, Delta of .9260... you get the idea.
* VERY IMPORTANT: the spin-off completed in November 16th, 2020. This should be the start date for you to looking into all fundamental and technical information. If you do this, you may understand my perspective a bit better.

This is basically my very first reddit post, and I apologize if my post was not up to your standard. I will try to do better! If anyone is interested, I can probably make an update every month regarding my VTRS position. Thank you! Happy Friday!"

2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DISCA - The shorts are dancing at the discA The not so talked about high SI digital growth stonk of the week: DISCA

40% SI (58m shares) last reported on 3/31, averaged 45-55M shares short through 2020. No clue what it is today.

$25 to $77 to $35/share fall-out from the fallen ex-billionaire ape Bill Hwang.

**DISCA**  
18B Valuation @ $38  
Forward P/E 13-15x  
Growing subscriber base of Discovery+ as of 1/2021  
Major Peers:  
Hulu sub base growing  
AT&T HBO Max sub base growing  
Paramount+ sub base growing  
Netflix 200m+ subscribers that need more content

Discovery+ released in Jan and is already in the top 150 apps in the app store on iOS

Call/Put Ratio for 5/21 - 66/37k as of 4/22 (0.56), Low IV  
Earnings 4/28

SI aside - DISCA, VIAC and T will continue to reap ad revenue rewards of going strong with digital content offerings following NFLX, Disney+, Prime Video and Hulu and providing content for years to come. I personally believe that Discovery has the best content out of all the offerings and could become the tertiary offering alongside NFLX and Disney+. With it's attractive valuation as it relates to its peers in the content space, this makes me bullish on the outsized up-side potential for discovery against its peers.

2021-04-22 22:24:55,wallstreetbets,About dilution?
2021-04-22 22:43:31,wallstreetbets,Unloaded it yesterday. Made about 10%. Can’t complain hoping for a winner here

If they do we can sue for defrauding the investor. So I honestly don’t see how having a big float that retail owns a majority of is a problem. Especially with utilization rate at 100 percent, borrow fee has been high, literally no shares available to short all day, and the share vote should have a share recount done before or after. So please do explain because I’m pretty retarded, don’t just refer back to the post."

2021-04-22 22:39:44,wallstreetbets,"Technically I was agreeing with and commenting to the OP, about an earlier time. That's why I referred you to the OP.
It wasn't all that shorted then, I think it was something like 8% and not only were they in debt they were handing out massive bonuses and diluting the shares. That's it. 
Short intrest, now is 31.68% in case anyone is curious."
2021-04-22 22:31:34,wallstreetbets,Fair points. Doesn’t change the fact that it’s over valued. It sure might keep climbing and climbing with the hype. It’s just extremely irrational. CNK is solid
2021-04-22 22:50:24,wallstreetbets,"Nah, not true at all. YOLOs are expected to be followed up after so we see the success. When you see a YOLO *and* a gain it brings it full circle."
2021-04-23 02:26:19,wallstreetbets,"Not OP, but you are actually a moron. He's not lying, they really did dilute by x4. The current market cap is higher than its ATH.


In the short term, they're not making money operating locations at 60% capacity and their debt literally piles up monthly; there is no end in sight. Even worse, business was on the decline for the last 4 years, the pandemic didn't put AMC in this position so reopening and resuming business as usual isn't enough to recover from this. The best way to fundraise(to handle the growing debt issue) is to sell more shares at it's current overinflated price(again), which is why they are voting to do exactly that.


As you say, Adam Aaron is a professional and probably has a good idea of what he's doing...you are not. It's very clear that you don't have experience with investing, which is why you're going to lose your money when the rug is pulled from under you and this stock is trading in the 1-2 dollar range. 


I just hope you post the loss porn when the time comes."

2021-04-22 22:53:51,wallstreetbets,fair enough. I’ll drop a comment
2021-04-23 10:59:04,wallstreetbets,\^This. It also doesn't help that they chose to pay the c-suite big money in this situation. Pretty much took advantage of the retail support the stock got. Also looking out for further intention to dilute--it was part of the shareholder vote (let's see if they decide to move on it).

I saw [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtsly8/options_chain_at_a_glance_for_spy_qqq_and_vxx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on here by u/Darth_Chef, analyzing the Option Chain for SPY, QQQ and VXX, and they brought up how options are priced initially using quant models – there’s some underlying expectation of asset prices in the future and calculations happen from there.

# What Does that mean?

Really simply, if you have a function `Pr(x)` that give the probability that the stock will be price x at some point before expiry  `∫ {min(0, x-k) \* Pr(x) } dx` will get you the mark price for a call with strike price `k`

# What am I Doing?

For fun and glory, I tried to take the existing option chain and work out the best model that would give the same result.

For the meme, the specific chain that I’m looking at is the 2023/01/20 of `the ticker that shall Not be Named`.

Trying to brute force the specific Probabilities (to say find all Y for  the chance of price being X is Y for each value of X) was too big - don’t try to optimize something with 500 independent variables, that are **very** dependent on one another. Instead I am looking at linear combinations of distributions

`Pr ~ ∑_i {w_i * N(mu_i,sigma_i) }` s.t. `∑_i {w_i} =1`

All models are Normal Distributions, fight me, yes it should be LogNormal Growth factors but using Normal get the Price Directly then I don’t have to worry about shape parameter or anything.

I'm optimizing based on the error weighted by the log of the open interest for the option, to give bigger emphasis to the more quantified options

# Conclusion

I would trust the Models with 3 or 4 Distributions, before that and they don't model the curves well, and after that and it's too close an approximation IMHO.

How I read the distributions in order of appearance:

1. New Normality, if a little down - 30-50% Weight
2. Bankruptcy -  17-22% Weight
3. Moon (quite a wide distribution) -  8-9% Weight
4. Febuary's Normal (Post spike 1, pre spike 2)
5. The Old Normal (Pre spike 1)

If the CV's were very small on all of these would it be justified to say 40% chance to be around 150,   9% chance to MOON, etc? yeah, but that's not my claim, they are *not* point estimates.

2021-04-23 02:42:00,wallstreetbets,I would say sell it and keep an eye on the stock. To me it looks like it might breakdown. If it does load up on weekly puts. Or if it goes up on a strong day buy calls make your 20-30% and get out the same day. The market is crazy if it drops NIOs support is like in the 20s.

2021-04-23 12:49:07,wallstreetbets,Long time lurker here. Bought 18 shares. First time I have ever bought shares. Feels good. Looking forward to getting carried away and losing all my money.
2021-04-22 22:32:03,wallstreetbets,holy fuck we found the DFV of MVIS
2021-04-23 12:53:51,wallstreetbets,Last week I traded according to what I learned in textbooks and lost like 40%. This week I sold everything and bought some random stock on WSB and I’m up 40%.
2021-04-23 04:54:12,wallstreetbets,"**STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES.** Microvision holds the key to the revolution that we as investors can only speculate about. Meanwhile, the 800,000-pound gorilla(s) and The Sharmanator + Best In Class BOD have ALL the resources needed to realize the MVIS potential. I have zero doubt that HERO Sharma fully grasps the potential and is more than capable of painting a genuine picture of where this ship is going. 

Here's a question. If one tech giant purchased a world-changing company like Microvision, would you or anyone consider that a monopoly? 

Lastly, Judy Curran Moderated the ""Digitization of Product Development"" panel today. If you watch/listen, you would have noticed overwhelming support for teamwork makes the dreamwork sensibility. You also would have seen that our dear Judy Curran wasn't on the panel but instead was the HMFIC.

Forget the buyout predictions. Get your tinfoil hat out and ask yourself how the stock price would react if Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Ford, and Amazon announced their ""strategic partnership"" with our very own, MF'ing Microvision!? I don't know about you, but that event would trigger the ""right value"" for me.  

Good luck sleeping tonight, everyone. The world is about to change, and we have a front-row seat. Imagine riding in an autonomous vehicle with your Hololens 10 on telling your family and friends about the time you were there, the dawn of the greatest YOLO the world has ever seen. The LEGENDS of the GME short squeeze and BEST IN CLASS longs of MVIS came together in UNITYYYYYYYYY

In conclusion, I'm not a financial adviser. Trading does carry risk, ESPECIALLY if you bet against the unicorn of our generation, MICROVISION, ticker symbol MVIS. In Sumit Sharma, we trust!

2021-04-23 11:46:18,wallstreetbets,Honestly im felling good by only having 90 shares @ 12.14 thinking about buying more cause the possibility of this blowing up to 100 with all the hype is bigger then kong's asshole
2021-04-22 21:14:11,wallstreetbets,"I first got in at 1.30. Not as many shares. Still, my profit is almost 100k at the moment. This is life changing for a 23 years still studying. No need to worry about money for the rest of my education."

2021-04-23 09:02:46,wallstreetbets,"I am truly vexed at the dichotomy between buying 200000 shares of a penny stock like a true autist with cash to throw around and buying 17 shares of GME at the top (which resembles most of my portfolio).

You do the math. And if every short position gets covered 100%, the stock will be above $50-75 per share. MVIS Gang!

Honestly do the math yourself before you judge me, do your OWN DD. This company is fucking valuableable if, you can’t see it- go to an ophthalmologist. I’m not a financial advisor and I can’t support anyone if they go broke yoloing into this stock. I own 2,200 shares of this bad boy"
2021-04-22 20:38:40,wallstreetbets,"hell yeah! my first purchase was at 2.50, and then it dipped after fall ER call. snagged more in the 1.80s and have been buying since. congrats!"

Mid 2020 that finally happened, so I went full 🧻👐 like a bitch! Le sigh. I've learned so much since then.. I could have 10x ($1250 what I put in and had some to spare.  I know I know weak ass money. Don't worry, nowadays I put every paycheck into the stock market."

Also it's insane how much even a small 10 percent gain of 2 mill can legit pay for the life style of any upper class person. Lol"
2021-04-23 03:44:59,wallstreetbets,"Holy crap, how does anyone have more then a few k laying around let alone a couple million?🤔"

2021-04-23 08:25:33,wallstreetbets,"Okay, so newish here and most probably an ape. Let’s say that’s enough for me to not work again. How do I ensure that I don’t lose that money after a stock like that inevitably crashes at least a bit without selling and enacting short term capital gains tax?"
2021-04-23 08:53:33,wallstreetbets,"O.k, very nice work, but why haven't you averaged down on gme?"
2021-04-23 09:45:45,wallstreetbets,Biden: that will be 43% tax for you sir
2021-04-23 09:50:31,wallstreetbets,"A WSB reco that actually pans out. Who would have thought? And I, being a full retard, am out. I only buy the ones that crash. Come to think of it, maybe this is why MVIS is mooning..."

2021-04-22 23:47:40,wallstreetbets,I call bs
2021-04-23 06:16:37,wallstreetbets,Calling bullshit here. You've only got 2500ish on a play that could be one of the biggest in history but you come on and drop over 2m on some none starter.

2021-04-22 22:36:32,wallstreetbets,Never was
2021-04-23 04:35:09,wallstreetbets,Tell a noob why everybody is so hyped about MVIS this days ?
2021-04-23 06:06:30,wallstreetbets,"I sold it other day when I didn’t make $ and it was sitting around ten. The next day it hit 13 lol. I got back in with just 5 shares at 13.07 and I’m making money. Nothing insane. But I went light on a company I know nothing about just following hype and stuff.   AMC is my true follow. I had it at $5 post squeeze seeing pre-Covid bad CEO and in debt stock pricing. The short squeeze gave them surplus cash vaccines, good movies. I invest in what I know.  That 5.91 a pop (200 of them) is looking beautiful now.

I got some MVIS

5 GameStop 


I have faith in the two of them.   Time and patience."

2021-04-23 10:01:38,wallstreetbets,Too late now.
2021-04-23 07:11:48,wallstreetbets,Wonder how easy it is to fake a picture like this 🧐
2021-04-23 09:29:26,wallstreetbets,what app is this? sorry for ignorance
2021-04-23 09:33:46,wallstreetbets,TD tho 🤤
2021-04-23 10:33:09,wallstreetbets,Nioooo up

2021-04-23 17:08:59,wallstreetbets,You're not all in. You have GME.
2021-04-23 18:41:54,wallstreetbets,"Hey, today is my birthday, mind if I have a grand or two?😅😅"
2021-04-22 21:28:15,wallstreetbets,Honestly I think it takes even bigger balls to put that much money in a stock priced at a dollar in the first place. And then a third nut to stay with it along the way.
2021-04-22 22:25:02,wallstreetbets,Not enough money to retire if you need to polish those massive steel balls every day.
2021-04-23 05:47:41,wallstreetbets,"you realize that OP initially invested 250k and not 2M

i dont think you retire with 250k"
2021-04-23 06:51:47,wallstreetbets,Something tells me this isn’t all of OP’s money
2021-04-23 08:23:37,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that the dream here? We yolo everything and either die or hit $5mm and then quit our jobs and live off of 7% a year.
2021-04-22 22:57:56,wallstreetbets,At least $MOON.
2021-04-23 08:19:08,wallstreetbets,"Excuse my ignorance here but what’s the deal with gamestop? Aren’t they a small retailer who sells pre-owned games and game consoles? Or is it digital game rental? Either way - I rarely watch the news these days (for reasons better left for a different thread) and have no idea why GameStop is such a hot ticket right now! 
Fundamentals or Technicals?"
2021-04-23 09:00:16,wallstreetbets,Share price will easily double from here on. Why settle for a 30 foot yacht when he can end up with a 50 foot yacht?
2021-04-23 09:52:57,wallstreetbets,$2.5M is not enough to retire on unless you’re already like 65
2021-04-23 11:23:36,wallstreetbets,"2m? With how theze mfqrs b pushing inflation, we all gonna need $250m minimum. Cocaine done doubled in price in like the last 6mo, that 2m aint nothin but a lifestyle weekend."
2021-04-23 05:52:39,wallstreetbets,Holy Molly guacamole
2021-04-23 07:42:07,wallstreetbets,You have no idea what yachts cost do you?
2021-04-23 08:45:50,wallstreetbets,That would be titanium. The steel would have never held up under the stress many of us endured to get to the promise land.
2021-04-23 10:26:22,wallstreetbets,Ever heard of paper money? It's really easy to go all in when it's not really your money.
2021-04-23 10:29:59,wallstreetbets,You know you can make fake money profiles right? You really think someone put $200k of real money into a $1 stock?
2021-04-23 10:45:02,wallstreetbets,Exactly
2021-04-23 12:20:43,wallstreetbets,It's either retiring on food stamps or a yacht. There is no in between.
2021-04-23 12:43:55,wallstreetbets,Imagine how much he has made after todays 35% gain
2021-04-23 13:42:55,wallstreetbets,YOLOOOO!!!!!!
2021-04-23 14:49:30,wallstreetbets,i mean if he has the money to throw 200k into a stock i feel like hes pretty well off lol

2021-04-23 01:08:26,wallstreetbets,"Wrong sub, put all that into some 20$ calls expiring next month and go buy a moon."

Also ""Covered call"" WTF. Even if you aint goin full Retard you should be selling puts."
2021-04-22 22:50:02,wallstreetbets,"Dude you'll get gradually more savvy until you're this guy. Honestly, my first 8 plays I was way behind, but you learn slightly more and more about how to withstand shorts and truly invest, and you get the balls to be this guy. 

I'll make significant 6 figures on MVIS only because I got wise halfway through. My original PPS was like 1.86.

Next time I'll accumulate huge share counts at that price when I see the signs."

2021-04-23 14:47:34,wallstreetbets,"Depends. I was in at $10.20 with 3000 shares and a bunch of calls. I sold out of it all around $17.80 today.

I’ve been learning I need to take profits when I have them, especially when it’s already guaranteed. However, MVIS could really scream higher still from here, depending on some the of PR news we are hoping for next week along with earnings. Could also really take off if they get bought out soon like a lot of people including me think they will. However, today was likely the majority of the short squeeze so you did probably miss that part of it. But I never really even bought in for the short squeeze potential anyways, it just sort of happened. TL/DR, you likely missed the short squeeze, but could still have money on the table due to the other reasons like PR announcements on their sample A lidar and potential buying for much higher than current share price of it happens.

I’m for sure going to buy right back in if it sells off a little before earnings next week."

2021-04-23 10:03:35,wallstreetbets,"$30 minimum, mid range estimate for buyout / strategic partnership is around $65-70, some speculate as high as $130 based on the revenue this company can unlock for OEMs and the big tech company. $30 is a safe floor though"
2021-04-23 10:06:05,wallstreetbets,"If a buyout or strategic partnership is announced then this stock will be $50-$65 easily. Chances of that happening is very high. 

that's what my guess is and I'm not a financial advisor"

2021-04-23 03:53:46,wallstreetbets,"Elon talks about mechanical Lidar, which is really not the same thing. It's big, has lots of moving parts that can fail, and costs several tens of thousands of dollars.

MVIS is making a new generation of Lidar the size of a VHS at a <1000$ price point. The only moving part is a very tiny mirror that's made to wobble really fast through an electromagnetic field.

It's called MEMS. Btw, MEMS is also one of the technologies you can use to make AR 'displays'. That's why this company that has been doing R&D and burning cash for 20 years on MEMS AR 'displays' is now coming out with best in class Lidar tech."
2021-04-23 09:53:19,wallstreetbets,Wait for buyout.
2021-04-23 09:06:54,wallstreetbets,"wow, bitter much? ANYBODY who buys stocks is trying to make money. The difference though is that we do not have all of the dirty tactics and/or info that the ""wallstreet scum"" does at our disposal, which makes what he's done even more impressive; so STFU.

The only thing I want to know is why the hell he hasn't averaged down on gme"

It’s probably slipped but at it’s $24 peak and on the way down it was literally the largest 52 week gain of any stock, it’s currently up 5000% from last year and could go 5-10x higher from here.... safer/more consistent ways to make money with that kind of capital?

2021-04-23 00:51:18,wallstreetbets,"It wasn’t that long ago that one brave retard forked up thousands of dollars to buy a pair of the hololense just to tear them apart and prove MVIS was making the chips that power them. 

I’m sure it’s already priced in, but the fact is that relationship still hasn’t even been formally announced, and hololense is getting big government money.

MVIS is an easy hold"
2021-04-23 01:39:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I mean it hit $24 at one point. Why he didn't post then, I have no idea. I've been riding 50-75 shares ever since it first hit $9 all the way up to $24 and back down again. Lately I keep buying at lows and selling for profit at current rangebound highs. MVIS has treated me well."

2021-04-22 22:44:55,wallstreetbets,It was when it hit 24....

2021-04-23 14:37:18,wallstreetbets,Uh at 3 or 4%? Easy. Especially because you can live in buttfuck nowhere so long as it has cellular internet service.

2021-04-22 22:46:37,wallstreetbets,"??? 

A conservative 4% annual gains comes out to 112k per year... and you have the freedom to move to a low cost of living city if you want your dollar to go further.. or live like a king in Costa Rica or something."
2021-04-23 05:06:43,wallstreetbets,"The rich get richer. Having $20 dollars in your pocket and no debt makes you richer than most, and having anything more than $100 dollars to yolo away makes you much more fortunate than most. I can invest 2k per month, but thats only because I have low expenses and would have spent it on booze and gambling anyway, so investing is just a better way to throw away money without felling guilty."

2021-04-23 01:12:09,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-23 08:36:09,wallstreetbets,Perfect time to sell.
2021-04-23 10:50:56,wallstreetbets,"When you own shares in blocks of 100, you can sell options rather than buying them. All it means is you agree to sell your shares at the strike price, which would be profitable for you anyhow. You give up your unlimited upside potential for cash now. If it doesn't reach that price by that date you keep all the premium. If it goes above the option will be exercised, you still keep the premium and sell your shares. In this example if it went to $30 he would miss out on the gains between $20 and $30, because that belongs to the option buyer."
2021-04-23 10:56:31,wallstreetbets,"I think not, you do have tendies here do you not? I see some right behind you..."
2021-04-23 11:27:52,wallstreetbets,"Sure it's spiking right now but he still would walk away very profitable still. Don't be mad about lost profit, be mad about losses."
2021-04-23 12:07:21,wallstreetbets,You're holding shares either way. If it goes down you profit from the options and can close the options for profit faster. You won't profit from the calls as much as it drops but you'll profit some.
2021-04-23 17:27:18,wallstreetbets,"When the premium is equal to my initial investment, making the shares I bought free, it's worth to do it at least up until that point. OP could have done this fairly safely on one of the many downfalls MVIS has taken over the past few weeks."
2021-04-22 23:45:57,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-23 01:45:41,wallstreetbets,"Hear hear! I spent 4 months 50% underwater in gme and got rewarded with the millionaire status. Also had the fortitude to hold when it dropped from 120 to 60. Never before in my life had I seen a +500k daily profit nor a -350k drop.

Withstanding shorts, doing your own DD, and having the strength and patience to wait it out is key. 

Selling at the first sight of green is what will end you."
2021-04-23 00:01:20,wallstreetbets,"Seriously how do you guys find these so far in advance, and have enough confidence in the dd to drop so much on it?"

I had planned to unload 1/4 of them on Monday morning (order placed after hours today) to make 2x my initial investment and let the other 3/4 ride till later in the contract. Would you let all the contracts ride with an anticipated spike or is what I'm currently planning the smartest strategy
2021-04-23 09:25:42,wallstreetbets,Because apparently then it wasn't cool so he had nothing to say.
2021-04-23 12:53:28,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong w that.
2021-04-23 00:03:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think it’s only two buttons
2021-04-23 10:34:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but to do it 141,000 times..."
2021-04-23 09:40:28,wallstreetbets,Ive won and lost
2021-04-23 13:50:12,wallstreetbets,"Not when you place 250,000 bets on that pony."
2021-04-23 05:54:33,wallstreetbets,"I mean our dude isn't hurting for money.

Who's to say he didn't take some profit at $20+.

(Although bro held thru when it broke under $1 and was -250k once so base on that alone he probably didn't sell any heh.)"
2021-04-23 07:51:39,wallstreetbets,Wow finally I'm rich
2021-04-23 08:26:45,wallstreetbets,"But you still mix in booze, blow, gambling, and hookers sometimes right?  Otherwise why bother?"
2021-04-23 08:59:14,wallstreetbets,I can invest $4.5K monthly outside of maxing my ira and Roth 401K but I don’t know what to put it in.  Wish I could figure out what to put it in!
2021-04-23 10:29:06,wallstreetbets,Let's be honest. Most people have plenty of money to invest if they wanted to. But delaying gratification isnt as nice as going to the bar and spending a few hundred on drinks
2021-04-23 09:20:51,wallstreetbets,“Investing” lol
2021-04-23 09:50:32,wallstreetbets,Stonks only go up though.
2021-04-23 10:52:45,wallstreetbets,I mean this here is the gambling fix anyways
2021-04-23 12:51:43,wallstreetbets,first time anyone’s called me rich
2021-04-23 11:51:11,wallstreetbets,"What's the rumor, what's the news?"
2021-04-23 00:01:03,wallstreetbets,I’m subscribed to investor emails. They sent one out a couple of hours ago saying they moved the date to the 29th
2021-04-23 11:11:38,wallstreetbets,GME of course
2021-04-23 14:41:48,wallstreetbets,Is announces their first-quarter earnings that day.
2021-04-23 10:58:21,wallstreetbets,"Are you suggesting buying items in the 4 for $4 with the profits of the CC and then reselling the items when the deal goes to 4 for $5, undercutting Wendy’s selling 4 for $4.50 securing a +10% profit....because if so Warren buffet would like a word with you...."
2021-04-22 23:49:30,wallstreetbets,Obligatory congrats but no fuck you I respect the balls you have sir I hope one day I can be like you as u/KomraD1917 mentioned.
2021-04-23 07:49:38,wallstreetbets,Been there a few times. From deep underwater into slight green and my finger just stormed out to the sell button. Retarded move.
2021-04-23 03:15:13,wallstreetbets,Sorry but what is DD?
2021-04-23 00:21:14,wallstreetbets,That’s my question. I didn’t know about MVIS until it was at $10 again.
2021-04-23 00:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Ask any PLTR, UWMC, BB, or, to a lesser extent, RKT holder.  Shit, you could've said the same about GME before it became cool to hold.  Steel Gang is pretty confident of their buys.  I think Weed Gang is just high.

It isn't really rocket science.  Find a stock that is fundamentally undervalued with massive upside.  Find a stock that will *inevitably* have catalysts.  These days, massive shorts are considered a catalyst.  Find one of those stocks that can't possibly go tits up (one that is fairly insensitive to the stock price).  Buy it, hold it, love it.  Buy cheap ass LEAPS or shares.  Forget about it.  Come back in a year to massive green dildos whenever it gets enthusasism."
2021-04-23 04:06:16,wallstreetbets,Dude they failed alot and then they hit one and act like a they wrote the book....Stat with us and the theme of the sub please
2021-04-23 00:08:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah - this
2021-04-23 10:29:40,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, first post on WSB, but I have to chime in here. Been in MVIS for almost 16 years now. It's been an unbelievably rough road, but when you've been to the ASMs and seen some of the small miracles that have come out of MVIS it was easier to keep the faith and know this day would come. 

Cathy Woods said, ""in the electronics industry, being ten years early is the same as being wrong."" MVIS was ten years early, but hung onto the edge of the cliff by it's fingernails mostly thanks to some fanatical investors who believed the future would eventually catch up to Microvision.

Holding 76,038 shares at a little under two bucks...and will until the day dawns that sees Microvision become a powerhouse in the market."
2021-04-23 01:07:43,wallstreetbets,Buy.....And hold..  bought this pos at 1.20 a year ago and sold a couple months later cause it was slowly bleeding... Even thought the dd i did was solid af...  Patients my friends.. on to the next.. Fuck the lookin back bullshit..
2021-04-23 10:56:46,wallstreetbets,"I think wallstreetbets gives you a skewed idea of how trading works. There are almost 10 million users, some of them are gonna make big gains, and then post about it. If say 10,000 ppl buy a stock all at different times, at least a few of them are going to time it perfectly."
2021-04-23 06:16:41,wallstreetbets,Luck

2021-04-23 06:58:25,wallstreetbets,"That's part of it, sure, but it's more than just that. It's an emerging sector in a bull market, so the TA I've learned is geared to that.

It's also good tech. Knowing what the next wave of computing will probably look like. Being able to envision the tech applications the way the larger market will eventually recognize"

2021-04-22 21:16:01,wallstreetbets,I found it at $0.88 on stocktwits just jumping board to board. I liked the energy of the people so i did some DD and am 100% in though my average is much higher now 🥴 2108@ $21.46
2021-04-22 21:20:37,wallstreetbets,"Mvis was on Reddit last summer on rumours about an acquisition my Microsoft. Turns out that was a lie and mvis dipped, only to shoot up 1000% later"
2021-04-22 21:11:54,wallstreetbets,Best comment I've read all day
2021-04-22 21:09:37,wallstreetbets,"Nah. I'm an 80s child. Worked a bunch of shit jobs for awhile. Kept my head down, tried to make smart decisions, & just kept going. Doesn't hurt I married up & my wife's boyfriend didn't mind."
2021-04-23 13:20:45,wallstreetbets,"Nice lol. I dipped my tie in this today bought 100 and sold a cc on top, started feeling like it might shift so I closed my call for a -50 and sold the shares for a +100 and then sold 2 $12 21 may 21 puts"
2021-04-23 17:35:56,wallstreetbets,I needed to listen to that at +25% on volatile-ass currency markets in 2 months.  F
2021-04-23 10:15:44,wallstreetbets,"Good for you man. I sure as fuck didn't have $10k laying around in college, and if I had, investing it would have been at the bottom of my priority list"
2021-04-23 13:44:08,wallstreetbets,"That’s true, I can’t imagine what he feel now"
2021-04-23 17:06:12,wallstreetbets,Was talked a lot in the pennystocks forum and also has its own forum. Bought at 0.9 because they were hyping a buyout at earnings and got stopped out at 0.7. Sad.
2021-04-23 15:03:02,wallstreetbets,"Nope, not before earnings at least. Shorts will not short it as aggressively after this spike the same way they have after all the other spikes the past few months due to earnings next week. But it has sold off after EVERY big spike prior to this so maybe there is some pressure next week? I don’t have a specific target price, and I’m going to buy back some form of exposure prior to earnings for sure. I’m just thinking it MAY possibly be cheaper then it’s current price at this moment. I think $12 is out the window for now, UNLESS their announcement along with earnings is a complete let down... so we shall see"
2021-04-23 15:32:33,wallstreetbets,"Edit, I just bought 50% back in at $18 lol. I liked the close today with the consolidation the last hour+"

2021-04-23 09:56:20,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I made 6 figures on GME before the real dummies crawled in. Are you sure you dont need a job?"
2021-04-23 10:48:03,wallstreetbets,Buyout meaning being sold to a higher entity?
2021-04-23 10:24:37,wallstreetbets,Where do I find out if that happena?

Some of us go into market enthusiasm, but you will *always* catch the short bus on the way up you will never catch the bottom and many times holding the bag on the way down (most never sell at the top).  There is money to be made there, but it's mostly a Theta gang deal."

1. born mid 80's
2. go to college and actually prioritize learning
3. get decent paying regular job and try hard
4. save 10% every year on top of maxing out your 401k
5. put money in brokerage account and start learning about investing
6. get raises at your job
7. keep saving
8. have enough foresight to ""buy the dip"" when a giant global pandemic fucks everything
9. profit

2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Fubo Analysis - Why I Own It and Am Bullish Long Term (Cross posted from Fubo’s investor subreddit)

I’ve been meaning to get all of my thoughts into one place and now seems like the perfect time to do so after the stocks been down so much. I think a lot of people have let their emotions get to them and have just been thinking irrationally, as nothing has fundamentally changed.

For context I own 1,142 shares at $24.55 avg cost. My fair value of this stock as of right now is $30 a share but I have a PT of $40 EOY. Anything around this price is an absolute steal.

So why are people bearish on Fubo in the first place? 

- There’s a lot of competition when it comes to live streaming services.

This is definitely true, however a lot of these companies will never be profitable. The costs are plentiful and it takes a lot of subscribers to actually become profitable. I’ll explain why Fubo can become profitable a lot easier than other services later on.

There’s obviously more bear cases, but that is the main one I wanted to talk about.

Now onto some positive points and why I plan to hold Fubo for years.

- 75 million Americans have yet to cut the cord, and 43% said they plan to in the next 12 months.

- Fubo makes more money per user than any other streaming service ($70 per month and growing)

- Fubo’s main demographic is the most profitable when it comes to ad revenue. 

- Fubo plans on eventually making $20 per user per month in ad revenue, already increasing 174% since last quarter.

Now let’s get to what you all want to hear... sports betting.

To put it in perspective of how big sports betting actually is, 140 million Americans placed a bet on some sporting event in 2008! (Yes, 2008. Years ago when not as many states allowed it).
For even more perspective, Draft Kings has 565,000 active monthly users, and brought in $644M in revenue in 2020 (around $1200 per user). Their company is worth $25B. So why will sports betting help Fubo? 

- Sports betting is extremely profitable, especially prop bets etc. (I’ll touch on this a bit later)

- Fubo did a survey amongst its users and said that 22% of their users would put $100 a month into sports betting. Before I go any further, I think it will be around 30-35% as people will join Fubo for the sports book alone, and the convenience of everything.

- Assumimg that Fubo grows as it has been, they would bring in around $300M alone in revenue off the sports book. (Doesn’t include Advertising and Subscription revenue.) This is nearly half of draft kings last year revenue, again, a $25B company. 

- Fubo can place prop bets/betting slips of any game you’re watching. For example, you’re watching a Lakers game and Lebron gets fouled, they can place a betting slip for you to bet instantly that Lebron makes both free throws.

- Fubo can use your data from betting to make ad revenue even more profitable. 

- Fubo is in a much better position than YouTubeTV because of their sports betting addition. Fubo could essentially run their subscription at a loss, and either undercut YTTV’s monthly price, or add back the channels that they lost (Turner Channels specifically). 
From then on it wouldn’t make sense to stay with YTTV, as Fubo has much more channels and RSN’s.

Edit: if you have any concerns/questions just ask, trying to get better at analysis. I’ve studied this company more than any I have before, and am more confident long term than ever."
2021-04-22 20:23:05,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip at $33 🙂
2021-04-22 20:41:38,wallstreetbets,"430 shares @ $20.42 & one 1/20/23 $20c here. 

I lost a few K's on 4/16 calls due to poor timing, but still believe in FUBO.

Thanks for the DD."
2021-04-22 22:05:28,wallstreetbets,TDA news is saying part of the archegos blowup left nomura with 4.7M shares of fubo to dump.  That could be a major reason.  Hopefully it's over now and it can go back up a bit.
2021-04-22 21:50:48,wallstreetbets,"avg here at 21 with 1000 shares, I believe in the company for a few reasons. 1. ad revenue is ""easy"" to grow vs other revenue 2. their subscription growth is fast 3. worldwide market 4. big sporting events coming up, especially the olymics and world cup 5. sports betting can be massive for them.

&#x200B;

with all that being said I don't think your due diligence is as good as it seems as you are brushing over quite a bit. the biggest issue its facing is cash burn, they are losing roughly 40 million dollars per quarter. It literally costs them more to get all the channels than how much they are currently selling them for. you can see that because their subscription expenses are higher than subscription revenue. They only have 130m cash on hand because they raised 200m not too long ago but they are going to have to raise more money again soon. I think its pretty ignorant to act like anything around 30-40 is an absolute steal.

&#x200B;

yes I believe in the company, there is a reason I am invested, those are listed above. however if you are investing in this please understand that this is a gamble, its a race between profitability and positive cash flow. good luck to all"
2021-04-22 23:23:24,wallstreetbets,Filled my bags today. FUBO is a good company. This can easily 2-3x short term at it current price
2021-04-22 20:10:43,wallstreetbets,Great DD. I’m on board.
2021-04-22 20:22:14,wallstreetbets,Only thing I’m concerned about is the dish + draft kings partnership which gives them access to a far bigger user base to work off of and an already established brand. Holding long term though
2021-04-22 20:57:48,wallstreetbets,"I’m bullish long term (2-5 yrs), but short term performance and volatility are putting me off going in for shares of leaps. (More profitable, less risky plays doing PMCCs).

Maybe this is bottoming out after the initial early hype, definitely keeping an eye out.

Hopefully the constant tea-bagging by the bond market eases off soon."
2021-04-22 22:17:52,wallstreetbets,"Here’s my issue. Live sports betting on a streaming service won’t work until the huge streaming delay is cut down. Granted I use YouTubeTV but I’m well behind live.l and assume other streaming services are too. This means if a bet pops up, the result is likely already known or at least actual odds aren’t what is shown. So what’s the point then? No way they can stand behind odds that someone watching OTA (or even via mobile at the event!) could know the outcome for sometimes a minute ahead of time. 

Fubo seems to be a good sports streamer and I’ve been watching them for a few months but I just can’t get past that. Also don’t like the massive reverse splits they’ve done."
2021-04-22 21:15:42,wallstreetbets,I’m all in!
2021-04-22 21:16:03,wallstreetbets,Nice DD BTW :)

2021-04-22 23:22:41,wallstreetbets,"I bought the dip at $37 and watched keep dipping.   My avg is now $32, just gotta keep lowering it every paycheck."
2021-04-23 00:23:37,wallstreetbets,"2 things. the APP sucks compared to other streaming apps. The interface is just terrible. 

BUTT (and it’s a big one) they are one of the ONLY streaming services that still offers regional sports (hockey, baseball). Hulu doesn’t. YouTube TV doesn’t. I’d go back to YouTube TV in a second if they offered regional sports because their app and service is great. But we watch a lot of hockey so FUBO it is

I think that reason alone is a good one to be bullish"

&#x200B;

FUBO PLS FLY AGAIN"
2021-04-23 04:01:38,wallstreetbets,"FuboTV is a pretty good service, but WAY too expensive IMHO. You can get Discovery+, Disney+, Netflix AND Paramount+, all for less than half the cost of FuboTV.

I don't watch a ton of tv, and have only one of these services, Discovery+, which is surprisingly good for $5.99 per month. The FuboTV packages start at $65 per month and up from there."

2021-04-23 05:59:32,wallstreetbets,"I think you should also mention that even though they have a high revenue per sub, they pay I high price for the content on a sub. I think they are pretty much just breaking even from a per sub basis excluding advertisment. 

The thing about the sport´s betting which makes it so important, is that they get a higher profit out of each sub, therefore getting closer to being profitable.

Without this addition, they would struggel, no matter how many subs they get."

2021-04-22 22:59:47,wallstreetbets,"You need to sell 10 of those shares, or you're just not doing it right."
2021-04-22 22:20:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it was part of that blowup. I think it’s now oversold"
2021-04-22 22:00:22,wallstreetbets,"And in all honesty I don’t think profitability is too far away. I truly believe that they will have 1 million subscribers by the end of the year, and if they get to their goal of $20 per user per month then they’ll be profitable off that alone."
2021-04-22 21:54:03,wallstreetbets,"This was never a post meant to be a DD honestly. It was a post I put on Fubo’s investor subreddit because the stock was down so muc. and I think people forgot why they were holding in the first place. That’s why I focused so much on bullish points and ignored some bearish points, because there obviously are some. I don’t think 30-40 is a steal, I think it’s worth $30 fundamentally as of now. I think anything around $20 is a steal though."
2021-04-22 20:27:17,wallstreetbets,"Dish isn’t able to target betting slips towards its audience due to data and regulatory issues between two companies. Since Fubo owns the sports book, they can implement betting slips for games that their customers are watching, while also potentially adding betting slips on specific plays. I’m sure their sports book will have some success no doubt, but it’s definitely not the same experience as Fubo."
2021-04-22 22:22:20,wallstreetbets,"Could definitely see where that is a potential issue, however being “behind” could be based on the actual channel you’re on, and if Fubo was to implement bets on live, individual plays I’m sure they’d figure out a way to be on time.

And I don’t know what you mean by stock splits, if you’re looking at it through cashapp it shows a graph that looks like it went through stock splits but it never has. It IPO’d in September or October."
2021-04-23 09:16:02,wallstreetbets,"Honestly the app surprised me, I thought it was pretty good. Not sure what you don’t like about it, because the quality on channels is great, at least from what I’ve seen."
2021-04-23 08:07:25,wallstreetbets,Different audiences. Fubo targets sports. Most people buying Fubo likely aren’t comparing it in cost to Disney+
2021-04-22 20:33:21,wallstreetbets,"I've thought about averaging down but don't want to tie up anymore $$ in it, many other stonks I can lose $$ on 🥲
Been selling CCs to being my cost down  though"
2021-04-23 00:06:13,wallstreetbets,5/21 17.5c is 4.20 right now
2021-04-22 20:35:05,wallstreetbets,What do you mean target betting slips?
2021-04-23 13:09:43,wallstreetbets,"I find it to be bogged down with menus and submenus and sometimes struggle more to find what i'm looking for I guess. I suppose it could just be the differences from Youtube TV because I was more accustomed to it, but I find myself spending more time scrolling and looking for my local sports teams (Bruins, Revs, BoSox) when they are on. On Youtube TV they are always the first things on the screen as it recognizes that I'm probably wanting to watch those."
2021-04-22 20:37:54,wallstreetbets,"The farthest Dish can go in implementing a sports book is adding it to a tab or separate from the actual games. Fubo can add betting slips to the screen as you’re watching, as well as on to your phone. It may not seem like a big deal, but as someone who rarely bets on sports (only on big games), I’m much more likely to make a bet when I’m exposed to a betting slip right in front of me."
2021-04-22 20:41:42,wallstreetbets,"Ah. What about the low margins? How are you seeing them go about lowering costs etc to make money as they scale? TNT is a big loss imo for sports, a lot of NBA games are on that network only"
2021-04-22 20:44:38,wallstreetbets,I like this.
2021-04-22 20:45:49,wallstreetbets,"That brings me to a bear point I actually didn’t bring up, because in a way you’re right. The right to live sports is expensive obviously, but ad revenue is more profitable. If they get to theyre goal of $20 per user per month in ad revenue, they’ll make more than enough profit, anything that has to do with the sports book is just icing on the cake and can help them scale internationally. A big reason why I’m such a bull on Fubo is because they’ve been finding ways to make profits in an industry that’s known for low margins. They’ve talked about also partnering with DoorDash, delivering food to your house from your TV. There’s a lot more they can’t talk about though, because of that bull shit lawsuit from earlier this year."
2021-04-23 01:46:04,wallstreetbets,I've been wanting to get into FUBO ever since it fell below $30 but my main concern is the margins. I'd really love to value this company as a NFLX or other software/tech company and give it that sweet tech co. multiple but with margins barely in the double digits I've been holding back till I see some improvements. Maybe you can add a section on analyzing potential ad revenue. Def would like to learn more about this company's potential

Back in 2012, just after Facebook IPO, a significant concern emerged among investors. Consumers were increasingly using their mobile devices to access Facebook. Since the screen sizes of mobile devices were small, investors were worried about the monetization potential of Facebook's mobile users. As a result, the stock dipped to below $20 from the highs of $40 plus just after its IPO. Mark Zuckerberg noted that users are spending more time while accessing Facebook on Mobile versus desktop and it should benefit Facebook but investors weren't convinced. Facebook introduced News Feed advertising around the same time which coupled with users spending more time on Facebook resulted in better monetization and higher revenues for Facebook. The moral of the story is if you give consumers what they want and how they want it, it will likely lead to them consuming more of your content resulting in better monetization and higher revenues.

A similar transition is happening at Discovery with its recently launched Discover plus app. For the last several years Discovery was lacking a good OTT or Direct to Consumer (DTC) offering. Many consumers prefer their digital devices to access content rather than linear television. They also like to access the content library at their will to see what interests them at a particular time and not what is being shown on television at that time. Television viewership is in decline and Discovery not having an attractive product for cord-cutters was a big headwind for the company. This changed with discovery plus launch in January this year.

&#x200B;

**Higher Domestic ARPUs**

While it is just initial few days, management noted that consumers are already spending more time when they watch content on the Discovery plus app versus linear television. This coupled with the ability to provide more targeted advertising on mobile bodes well for content monetization in the long term. In its December presentation, management noted that the company generated an ARPU of \~$7 on linear television in the United States. In the U.S. ARPU on Discovery Plus app is matching linear initially on the ad-free offering with a potential to move higher over the next few years. On the ad lite offering the ARPUs are expected to be higher than linear at the launch with further upside potential as the company is able to deliver more targeted advertising.

&#x200B;

**Much Higher International ARPUs**

The swing in the international market is expected to be much higher with pricing on the Discovery plus app being 3x to 4x in many of these markets. Discovery's U.S. Networks generated revenues of $6.9 billion and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (Adjusted OIBDA) of $4.0 billion during 2020, while its International Networks generated revenues of $3.7 billion and Adjusted OIBDA of just $723 million in the same period. This despite much higher viewership in international markets. For example, Discovery Channel had approximately 86 million subscribers in the U.S. as of December 31, 2020, while Discovery Channel and the Discovery HD Showcase brand had approximately 277 million cumulative subscribers and viewers in international markets. TLC had approximately 85 million subscribers in the U.S. and 5 million subscribers in Canada that are included in the U.S. Networks segment as of December 31, 2020, while TLC content had approximately 356 million cumulative subscribers and viewers in international markets.

If the company is able to monetize international subscribers better on the discovery plus app, it can be a game-changer for the company.

Initial Discovery plus pricing is a step in the right direction. The company first experimented with the discovery plus app in India last year. India is an example where Discovery's content is very poorly monetized. For linear TV you can get a discovery subscription starting around INR 8.26 per month or \~$1.32 per annum. The company's heavily discounted annual discovery plus app subscription for one screen is priced at INR 299 per annum or slightly more than $4 per year which is more than 3x linear. The monthly subscription is currently at INR 99 per month or $1.32 per month (which is equal to the annual subscription they charge on linear TV). Still, it has seen 4.5\* review on Google Play with most of the consumers loving what they are paying for the content and criticism mostly around technical issues like download feature not available, etc. It is not a meaningful market in terms of economics right now but nonetheless, it illustrates what the company is doing to improve monetization in international markets and they clearly are heading in the right direction.

So, transitioning from a linear to a digital world is likely to lead to higher ARPUs both in the U.S. and abroad.

&#x200B;

**Lower Breakeven**

One thing which differentiates Discovery from other players is its leadership position in non-scripted content which has higher margins. The company's library of high-quality owned content gives it a competitive edge in its niche compared to other OTT platforms. This will enable Discovery plus to break even earlier than most of its peers and have better margins than them.

The math here is simple. In FY2020, the company's next-generation revenues were \~$850 mn and the net impact of next-generation investments (expense minus revenues) was \~$500 mn. So, the company's expense on the next-generation initiative was \~$1,350 mn in FY 2020.

In Q1 the company's next generation revenues were trending up 50% yoy. If management was using this 50% as the annual revenue growth number (50% of FY2020 revenue (850 mn) = $425 mn incremental revenues in FY2021) while giving guidance for incremental $200 mn to $300 mn in headwinds from next-generation investments, the total incremental expense for next-generation initiatives in FY2021 would likely be in $625 mn (= $425 mn + $200 mn) to $725 mn (= $425 mn + $300 mn) range.

If we add it to last year's expense of \~$1,350 mn, we have total expense attributable to next generation initiatives in $1,975 (= $1350 mn + $625 mn) to $2,075 mn (= $1350 mn + $725 mn) range or $2,025 mn at the midpoint for the current year.

If the company is able to get $7 per month in ARPU, the company can breakeven at \~24 mn subscribers with this cost structure \[Calculation: 24 mn users \* $7 in ARPU per month \*12 = $2,016 mn in annual revenue vs $2,025 mn expense calculated above\]. I don't think 24 mn subscribers is that distant a dream given the catalysts like the upcoming Tokyo Olympics and Beijing Winter Olympics, and several new launches scheduled for the back half of this year.

My calculation above considers management expectations before Discovery plus got solid traction. It is entirely possible that management decides to invest more to accelerate further the solid traction Discovery plus is gaining. They are managing the next-generation business for long-term growth rather than just breakeven. But I won't be surprised if this business starts contributing $1 bn plus to the bottom-line and free cash flow as subscriber count grows to 40 mn plus over the next couple of years.

Management had initially provided OIBDA margin guidance of discovery plus as at least 20%. However, on its last earnings call and a Deutsche Bank conference in March, CFO indicated that there was a lot of conservatism build in that number. I believe discovery plus can easily see an OIBDA margin in the 30% to 40% range as it scales over the next couple of years.

&#x200B;

**Low Valuation**

Before Discovery plus launch analysts and investors were characterizing Discovery as a company in secular decline with linear Television subscribers cutting cords and moving to OTT platforms.

They were skeptical of the company's ability to attract subscribers on its DTC platform and were questioning whether customers will pay for Discovery's content versus the already existing players like Netflix.

The successful launch of Discovery plus has proved the bear thesis wrong. The company gained \~7 mn new DTC paid subscribers in January and February. While the skeptics may continue to question whether consumers will use online streaming apps other than Netflix, consumers have already spoken - they are using multiple apps. Netflix's net new users' count fell significantly short of analysts' estimates last quarter while other players gained traction. I believe Netflix is a good company with a significant potential to increase its ARPU, but there is no denying that there will be other providers which will co-exist. This is the same as multiple content providers on linear television.

Skeptics are ignoring Discovery's leadership position in non-scripted content which has higher margins. With Discovery plus, the company has the potential to significantly grow its revenue and profitability in the short, medium, and long term. So, the company deserves a much better valuation.

The company has generated \~$3.1 bn in annual free cash flow in FY2019. If we exclude \~$300 mn of net investments (expense - revenues) in new DTC investments, free cash flow from the legacy linear business was \~$3.4 bn. Last year, due to Covid-19 related headwinds and \~$500 mn in DTC investments, the company posted \~$2.3 bn in free cash flow. Excluding DTC investments, the free cash flow from the legacy business was \~$2.8 bn. I believe in a normalized environment, it is a reasonable assumption that the company's linear business can generate free cash flow over $3 bn. While this year the company's FCF is likely to be impacted by further investment in DTC given the strong traction discovery plus is gaining, I expect FCF to grow substantially above $3bn in the medium term as it sees better monetization and margins from Discovery plus.

The company's current market cap is less than $16 bn or \~5x its legacy linear business free cash flows. This implies investors are expecting the company's business to continue declining and it is failing completely in its DTC strategy. It makes no sense as the company is doing well in terms of its DTC performance.

I believe the company can easily reach $4 bn to $5 bn in free cash flow over the next few years with the pivot to DTC at higher ARPUs adding a billion or two to legacy linear business FCF. If we assign a P/FCF multiple of 10x, the market cap should reach $40 bn to $50 bn versus currently less than $16 bn. So, there is a potential for its stock to triple from the current levels.

Class wise Discovery A shares and C shares are certainly cheap. I am preferring A shares as I am exploring the potential of ""retail activism"" (discussed in the next section) and A shares have voting rights while C shares don't. B shares carry much higher voting rights but are trading at a significant premium. If Discovery plus continues to gain traction, I believe even B shares can go higher but the risk-reward scenario appears much more favorable for A shares.

I don't like to sound like promoting Bill Hwang's bull thesis here but frankly, I believe there is no bear thesis for short selling at this price other than scaring smaller investors.

&#x200B;

**High Short-Float**

By now everyone knows about Archegos implosion and how it impacted Viacom and Discovery's stock where the fund had a disproportionately large stake. However, there is more to the story. In addition to Archegos fallout, one of the reasons behind the recent correction in Discovery's share price is heavy shorting by short-sellers post-Archegos fallout.

The number of shares short for Discovery class A increased 13.43 mn from February 25th to March 30th. As of March 30th 58.98 million of Discovery class A shares were short representing 42.59% of the float. In the same period, 17.84 mn shares of Discovery C class were sold short. A similar attempt to short Discovery B class shares resulted in a short squeeze due to low float.

Given the initial success of Discovery plus, I don't think there is a fundamental case to short Discovery at these levels. However, we have started seeing articles in media which are trying to portray the company in a negative light. There have also been selective leaks in media which have led to panic among small investors and caused a sharp drop. This seems to be the routine playbook of shorts to scare retail investors.

I believe Discovery A shares can be a good potential target given the high short interest, low valuations, strong cash flow generation profile, and somewhat of a hubris among short-sellers that it is ok to short a company that has incredibly good free cash flows and is successfully pivoting to DTC business which has higher growth potential and better ARPUs. Discovery has an offering that most of the investors themselves use and understand.

There is a significant risk to short-sellers if smaller investors chose not to panic and hold the stock as the company executes its DTC strategy.

NOT MY DD, from GS Analytics"
2021-04-23 04:08:20,wallstreetbets,Thank you for sharing this DD.  Now I feel even better about my position in DISCA shares.   The free cash flow is unbelievable and with adding DTC it should improve as mentioned in the DD.   For me this is a buy and hold stock.   Love the FB comparison for sure.
2021-04-23 09:54:12,wallstreetbets,"I invested very heavily in DISCA right before the crash based on the strong fundamentals (and because I was selling CC's due to the high IV). I've only sold a portion of my shares due to a margin call but am holding almost all of my position happily. My ideas were mostly similar to this analyst: margin, market niche, FCF. 

This report considers 40mn subs in the ""next few years,"" but they got to 12 mn in the first two months. Discovery+ could easily exceed 40mn in just the first year. If earnings next thursday have unexpectedly good subscriber numbers this stock should go nuts."
2021-04-23 06:10:50,wallstreetbets,"I loaded up A shares the other day. I don’t watch much TV but when I do it seems to be shows on discovery channel. The share price had dropped significantly and now seems reasonable. The price has been moving up as well. If it’s heavily shorted, they better cover. I’m up for a good short squeeze."

2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"U.S Steel short position. Never thought I would ask for advice here but this is what I found.

On 4/22/21 at 13:06:12,  a single order for 27,000 put contracts  were placed for X (U.S steel) to expire on 7/16/21 @ the strike price of  $18 for a premium of .78 cents per contract.  Total of 2.1 million in premium.

I believe this is an open long put because the open interest was only 1921, while the volume for the day was 32,184.  They could have unloading some contracts later on during the day but very unlikely.

Another reason I believe this was a long put because right after the purchase went through, the price took a steep dive, which indicated the market maker had started to sell shares due to the large volume of the put contract.

X (U.S steel) average volume is close to 21 million per day over the last 50 days. Which puts this order at around 13% of the average volume in the last 50 days if this was to expire in the money.  (Mostly likely to be closed before that happens but who knows. Also  27,000X100 shares = 2.7 million shares)

Since the strike price is $18 and the premium paid is .78 cents, we subtract the premium from the strike price since this is long put. Giving us a breakeven of $17.22. With the current price being 22.27, the stock price would have to drop more than $5 in the next 3 months. Which is close to 23% move in price.

Based on these assumption, I can assume that the premium of $2.1 million was paid and not collected in this situation. Sooooo now the question is should I follow the same position? Does anyone know why U.S steel would be down in the coming months?

Thank you everyone for your input. I think I’m gonna do this before I place trades from now on. This is perfect since everyone has their own thoughts and theory based on the same information given."
2021-04-23 07:43:35,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why it would go down 23%, removing of foreign steel tariffs wouldn't necessarily do this mainly because the majority of projects requiring large amounts of structural steel will not allow you to use steel produced in other countries due to quality concerns.  That may be slightly relaxed in the private sector, but most design engineers that are US based require US steel for the same reason.  Prices are already pretty high across the board for all construction materials I do not see that changing in the next few months, but there might be a sudden reduction due to Biden's corporate tax hike if that goes through.  Large projects and small will all take a pause in my opinion as they make an effort to decide where to price in the new level of oppression."
2021-04-23 02:30:06,wallstreetbets,"I think you have it backwards higher volume vs OI means they were likely sold to open.

Company is about to earn 8-14 per share this year and is sitting on equity of 10 already.

Nobody is betting it to go cheaper lol."
2021-04-23 07:39:38,wallstreetbets,"This maybe a true hedge, not an all in bet of a price drop.  Someone may have built a large position in an institution and has to cover it from a bad Biden tax plan outcome.  Timing of purchase with Biden announcement supports that possibility.

It could also be a real bet, but remember with options you only see the option part of the play.  You don’t know if its a piece of a more complex move, or an entire portfolio hedge against portfolio beta."
2021-04-23 08:30:07,wallstreetbets,The steel plants are all shutting down at exactly the same time to do repairs and maintenance. (This based off of my own steel suppliers telling me they will not be able to commit to filling my orders after May. Not knowing when operations will be back up.) Which will leave no sales on the books for that time period.
2021-04-23 07:39:09,wallstreetbets,"Check out r/vitards. There’s a whole subreddit devoted to steel stocks, and nobody there thinks it’s gonna go down. Lots of good info over there"

2021-04-23 08:25:19,wallstreetbets,"Steel was forced to short supply to raise price by The mills themselves . 2020 steel actually decreased in price due to supply. Since December there has been a compounding 10% interest on products I procure in the concrete industry (infrastructure). While scrap is going down supply is still short. We are being told after June the price will March the scrap, which basically means the mills will release stock to set a new baseline.  Collusion happens frequently in these markets, even multi continental.  Guess who’s price didn’t raise? Asia"
2021-04-23 02:49:10,wallstreetbets,But why now??
2021-04-23 02:52:49,wallstreetbets,So if there’s less supply and more demand wouldn’t the price go up??
2021-04-23 02:41:08,wallstreetbets,"The open interest is how many contracts are still active before the start of the trading day. The volume is how many contracts were traded throughout the day. It could be contracts that were open or closed. 

Since the open interest was only 1921, it’s impossible to close the single transaction of 27,000 contract. This means that it was an open order. It could have been a long or short order but, since the price drastically dropped after the order was made, it’s more likely the put option  was bought rather than sold."
2021-04-23 08:25:25,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. A true hedge in this situation makes more sense. 

A firm wanting to protect their holdings due to the proposed tax plan. So let’s say that’s the plan here, why till July? And does this mean they will continue to buy premium after July ?"
2021-04-23 08:36:25,wallstreetbets,"This is interesting, why would they all have to shut down in order to repair and maintenance.

2021-04-23 08:11:17,wallstreetbets,"Just guessing here, but there's been a massive short supply of steel following the pandemic shutdowns. If Biden wants his infrastructure plan, we're going to need to import a lot of steel...domestic supply simply won't be enough. Not to mention China has been buying up tons of steel, further reducing the supply, and prices for steel have mooned. Decreasing tariffs on imported steel is likely easier than asking for more money in his infrastructure bill."
2021-04-23 09:16:32,wallstreetbets,"Prices have risen in my industry around 25% this year, steel and basically all building materials are absolutely fucked right now.  It's not good for anyone except for steel producers."

2021-04-23 09:10:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the price has been increasing drastically over the past 6 months. I’m not sure how this play, of buying puts fits in to what’s been going on unless the investor knows something that isn’t common knowledge yet. 

Steel quotes used to be good for at least a day, sometimes a few, now I’m hearing some companies are forcing expiration after 20-30 minutes..."
2021-04-23 02:43:32,wallstreetbets,"The price dropped dramatically because of bidens tax proposal.

Your logic doesn't compute lol"
2021-04-23 08:46:37,wallstreetbets,"Assuming that’s it, and that’s conjecture, if the proposal is announced officially next week, July gets them past the point of most of the negotiations on this based on the time stimulus took.  If might not be passed or even fully written.  The likely version that has a shot at passing, good or bad, will at least be better understood.  

During that time, a fund or institution could then maneuver in or out of other positions with a reasonable backstop against Biden getting everything he wants fast by cutting a great deal with the business friendly Democrats before they can move.   

There are a lot of other possibilities. This is just the one that came to mind when I saw your post.  Again, not a lot of information here other than the timing says this isn’t unrelated to the Cap Gain plan leak."
2021-04-23 09:18:17,wallstreetbets,It is my understanding that only three companies own all steel smelts in the US. We were a little confused also as to how no company would want to make money while the others were down. Instead everyone is going down at the same time.

An annual 10% increase for large volume producers would be a lot... this increase in frankly untenable for most of us in the market."

2021-04-23 12:36:41,wallstreetbets,"Good luck friend, but know that there is a subreddit full of steel investors who are not seeing the HRC prices drop until 2022."
2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Oscar Health Insurance [OSCR] Great stock with long and squeeze potential. EDIT: WRONG FLOAT ...


DISREGARD 


**Oscar Health Insurance \[$OSCR\]** is a technology-driven health insurance company founded in 2012

As of the time of writing, the **current share price is $22.75 - April 22nd, 2021**

IPO price on **March 3rd, 2021 was $39**.

It got beat down just like the rest of the market; due to investors feeling it was overvalued. Probably was, then.

Truth of the matter is OSCR is a great health insurance company with lots of upside and I'll tell you why.

It has [close to a billion dollars cash on hand](https://imgur.com/ywOXUys), with a current market cap of **4.62 billion**. ¼ of market cap in cash? Is this Apple? Lol

The main reason this company is not yet profitable is because **they have to pay out the premiums they collect from its customers**.

To whom you may ask?

To these entities called **re-insurance companies**. These companies insure the insurer in case of catastrophe. This is to avoid bankruptcy in a disaster. For companies newer in the game like Oscar, this is risk management and investment in the long-term. As the company grows they’ll no longer need it. Not to mention plenty reinvestment of the company. And it will grow. Its customers have a very high rate of satisfaction. It has a full stack, with an app that gets you 24/7 virtual doctor access. Free birth control and a whole bunch of stuff Americans need. A great thing about companies like these is that they invest in keeping its customers healthy. I live in Canada with OHIP and I’d still pay for that shit.

**NOW FOR THE BEST PART - THE SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. EVERYONE LOVES THAT SHIT.**

\- I’ll repeat. As of writing\*\*, the current share price is $22.75, and its IPO price on March 3rd, was $39.\*\* This stock got absolutely hammered by shorts. How hammered? Check it out.

\- **There are 168 million shares outstanding.**

\- **However, only 15 million shares are public float.**

**- 42% of that float is shorted**

By who? I don't care. [Proof here](https://imgur.com/IiygNhW). If anyone can figure out exactly who is, we know who we're burning

\- The stock price is bottoming in its current price range.

Want to how I know?

\- **There aren’t many shares left to short**. At the time of this writing, [there are only 60k shares available to short via iBorrow desk, at low interest too](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/OSCR), attracting the silly shorts, as opposed to it’s IPO when the cost to borrow was very high. 34% short volume ratio on the 21st alone which drove it down as far is it could go and brought it to my attention.

**Catalysts:**

Earnings is May 19th.

The next catalysts is our smart asses.

Calls are cheap! Even the $25 dollar ones expiring May 21st. This is great!

Let me know how you guys feel – fact check all this stuff, I'll update as we go along.

This is not financial advice, but I just LOVE the stock. I'm YOLO all I have, which is not much, I've been getting nuked - over 4k in losses in GME after doubling my small investment account. The comeback begins!

Peace, love, and happy investing!"
2021-04-23 02:03:16,wallstreetbets,"Their health insurance fucking sucks and I’d never recommend them to anyone. Fuck them.

Source: had them. never again. The number of health care providers that had never heard of them was impressive. 

Edit: also they have a connection to the Kushner family so most major cities will avoid them."
2021-04-23 01:48:47,wallstreetbets,Oscar will get crushed by Clov.

2021-04-23 09:01:32,wallstreetbets,Eh everyone has bad experiences with every health insurance company. Oscar isn’t too bad as far as insurance companies go. And they are huge on the exchange. Their provider network isn’t that small either. Don’t take one persons opinion as fact. There are far far worse carriers on the exchange. Molina and Moda for instance are terrible.
2021-04-23 04:47:53,wallstreetbets,I’ve already invested in CLOV

2021-04-23 16:45:49,wallstreetbets,Shit.... and here I was feeling good about turning 3k into 7k in my first year trading. Didn’t have the balls to go higher since I am a noob.
2021-04-23 16:51:10,wallstreetbets,"No no.. you have 1.7 mil , remember Bidens 40% capital gains tax"
2021-04-23 16:58:28,wallstreetbets,Damn it
2021-04-23 16:59:36,wallstreetbets,At least put half of that in a real investment stock and yolo the rest on a meme if you have to get that rush. Unless you were already wealthy then fk it throw it all into NAKD.
2021-04-23 17:19:47,wallstreetbets,Y’all make it sound so casual. I’ve been YOLOing for sometime but got a ass whopping. Y’all’s are smart but make it sound like it’s luck. It ain’t luck. It’s DD.
2021-04-23 18:20:33,wallstreetbets,Give this guy a well deserved vacation
2021-04-23 18:24:04,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-04-23 19:23:12,wallstreetbets,If you turn this upside down and red it's great loss porn. You can see where he started reading WSB in November.
2021-04-23 19:23:48,wallstreetbets,The fastest way to have a million dollars is to start with five million and lose four million.
2021-04-23 19:43:54,wallstreetbets,What did you yolo on
2021-04-23 01:20:13,wallstreetbets,why do people brag so much about their wealth on here.. its almost a huge slap in the face to everyone who works for a standard pay check
2021-04-22 21:32:11,wallstreetbets,🤔
2021-04-22 22:57:55,wallstreetbets,Noise and distraction for GME classic
2021-04-22 23:00:55,wallstreetbets,Dang can I get like $50k? My business needs new equipment!

2021-04-23 18:55:04,wallstreetbets,"WTF 😳!!!🦍🥰🥰🥰

Rake out 1/3 now 

- don’t even think about giving it back 

- with 1/3 in cash you’ll still be up %%% and play with the market money 

- maybe put in cash 2/3 and still have a $1m trading account.

Cash out 2 million while you can - do it now - 

Do it now and decide later 

- you will have 2 mil in cash and the market can do what it wants 

- and you can do what you want

- just do it 

- it’s your money and if you can’t build up another few mil on a one mil start, then at least you have a cash cushion to stay present in life

- just do it and BIG congratulations"
2021-04-23 19:05:58,wallstreetbets,Perfect timing for the govt to take 39% of it on a capital gain hike.
2021-04-22 20:03:14,wallstreetbets,Working on it
2021-04-22 20:53:32,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-23 01:11:10,wallstreetbets,I know someone who can turn all that in 30$

2021-04-23 01:15:50,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, I'm there but no way do I have the balls to take the risks OP did to take it to over 3 mill. That shit isn't easy at all."

2021-04-23 10:45:47,wallstreetbets,Ask the wife’s boyfriend for a loan while he’s finishing.
2021-04-22 23:56:01,wallstreetbets,"That part is easy! Just do what this guy did, starting with 8k. Math!"
2021-04-23 01:08:59,wallstreetbets,Just get a small loan from your dad. Easy. Or make more money. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
2021-04-23 12:04:21,wallstreetbets,"I mean $160 would be $3,201 if you subscribed to their newsletter."

2021-04-22 20:08:03,wallstreetbets,100 dolla sucky?
2021-04-23 00:46:35,wallstreetbets,I fucking feel this way too much.
2021-04-23 01:44:48,wallstreetbets,"You can suck 1,000 of them for $100 each, or you can suck 100 of them for $1,000 each. Simple math, even for a retard."
2021-04-23 02:37:24,wallstreetbets,What's your principal?
2021-04-23 09:04:30,wallstreetbets,You are smart.
2021-04-22 21:12:21,wallstreetbets,I turned 20k to 300k on GME. Wait what do you mean it doesn’t count if i never sold??? :(
2021-04-22 21:00:51,wallstreetbets,"Those are rookie numbers sun. Turn that 15k into $1,500 and report your chart"
2021-04-22 21:48:04,wallstreetbets,Dang boi. Down to $11. That's some loss porn right there.
2021-04-23 08:46:09,wallstreetbets,"No, you’re doing it right"
2021-04-23 09:02:58,wallstreetbets,"3k -> 1.6k, I'm great at this 😂"
2021-04-23 18:16:02,wallstreetbets,I'm down from like 100 to 5
2021-04-23 18:42:31,wallstreetbets,I'm legit not sure if you mean 11k or 11 lol
2021-04-23 19:26:41,wallstreetbets,"Lmao same. On the bright side, this is the era of dumb money so by losing money you might actually be too smart for the current meta. 

BB 🚀🚀🚀

DID SOMEONE SAY JARVIS DOD CONTRACT? 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-22 22:26:12,wallstreetbets,Not sure he has paid the taxes on these gains yet
2021-04-23 12:13:48,wallstreetbets,I second this.
2021-04-22 21:01:08,wallstreetbets,Mostly true - once you realize the position is going south you cut it early enough so it doesn’t wipe you out (and finding the right balance between cutting a loser and not selling at the low ... and that’s where luck comes in)
2021-04-22 22:59:30,wallstreetbets,The problem is that most people are too lazy to do the DD which is also why they panic sell a good stock. You have to have faith in what you buy so you can diamond hand the good ones.
2021-04-22 21:14:21,wallstreetbets,maybe... who's asking??
2021-04-22 20:01:43,wallstreetbets,You could probably still swing an early retirement even if you do minimal from here on. Depending on ur age I guess.
2021-04-22 22:17:31,wallstreetbets,gme got me from 7k to 60k to 0
2021-04-22 20:57:05,wallstreetbets,Put it back into gme. Easy as that
2021-04-22 23:44:18,wallstreetbets,Lottery winners end up broke because they chase the same thing and convince themselves luck was skill.
2021-04-23 12:58:07,wallstreetbets,If you follow this sub's advice you can do it. You can turn that 200 to 0.
2021-04-22 22:57:45,wallstreetbets,Best advice... You get more runs hitting singles than you do hitting home runs.
2021-04-23 09:22:56,wallstreetbets,"let me give you advice...""trusting the process"" on WSB is a good way to run the rest of your savings into the ground. turn your life around by learning a skill that can consistently make you money without risk"

2021-04-23 04:50:51,wallstreetbets,It goes the other way too. Can get stressful
2021-04-22 23:50:36,wallstreetbets,It will be more stressful when he has to pay taxes and uncle same takes another million dollar bite.
2021-04-23 08:34:41,wallstreetbets,You want to put that much money in higher dividend paying equities.
2021-04-22 22:44:27,wallstreetbets,Imagine we pay 57% for anything about 8k profit ish (pr year). 28 for less than that.
2021-04-23 10:20:12,wallstreetbets,Literal insanity.
2021-04-22 21:37:12,wallstreetbets,VIAC. Then again I just bought some calls so that likely means it will go down.

2021-04-22 21:02:15,wallstreetbets,How do you pick your winners and decide when to take the loss? Do you read other peoples opinions or only do your own DD?
2021-04-23 00:37:58,wallstreetbets,Flower your plants and pull your weeds
2021-04-23 08:27:50,wallstreetbets,The thing is there is so much DD and opinions that how do you decide what actually matters? Fundamental analysis is limited in todays market - majority of companies have minimal revenues and you are trying to predict what will happen 5-10 years down the line... How can anyone do that with any sense of conviction?
2021-04-22 21:16:51,wallstreetbets,Ameritrade won't let me sell COVERED CALLS on my GME shares all by myself (they are looking out for me) - i have to go thru broker to place them - great way to manage options when you have to wait every time you need to place/adjust the order except to sell...

Unfortunately if you 'won' your money like that (by PURE LUCK - I donno why OP is giving recommendations for), it's pretty inevitable that you'll lose a big chunk like that too (hopefully not 100%+ but it can happen).

2021-04-23 13:34:31,wallstreetbets,More like 999/1000. 9/10 implies a 10% chance of success 😂
2021-04-23 11:18:00,wallstreetbets,That sounds like a ridiculously unsafe investment strategy
2021-04-23 11:30:20,wallstreetbets,seriously if i had found out about stonks when i was suicidal i wouldve threw it all in

2021-04-23 08:35:17,wallstreetbets,"This is the difficult part. For me, I look at a few factors. First, I look where they are in their 52 week cycle. I want companies trading near their 52 week low. Then I find out why they are trading that low. If I am fine with it, I research further. I then look for sentiment. I want to see a dedicated base of longs talking about it. I then deep dive their technologies, what makes them unique, financials, etc. By the time I am done if I feel like something is off, I avoid it. If it feels good, I dive in."
2021-04-23 12:10:25,wallstreetbets,"Opinions of other people can be read, but I don't think they are worth anything. 

DD isn't something you get from someone else, unless you paid them and you trust them. DD is something you have to do. 

If you want to learn valuation, just start doing them. Pick 10 random companies you don't know, have someone remove the market cap from the materials for you and read everything. Do a discounted cash flow and put a number to it and compare it to current market value.

Or much simpler, try to evaluate how much you would be willing to pay for a random business in your town.

WSB is not a good place to learn about valuation. It's a good place to learn about options, but options are like crack. 

Valuation for me is an obsession."

2021-04-22 23:12:15,wallstreetbets,That’s a 72% gain per year not compounded lol good luck with that.
2021-04-23 00:46:28,wallstreetbets,What are you trading to make 6k a month per $100k with CC and CSP? I get that it’s a goal and you won’t always get it but that seems high unless it’s high IV stocks. I’m just asking to learn more as a strategy to use.

2021-04-22 21:43:57,wallstreetbets,That also does not sound correct lol. You think they own 90% of their shares?
2021-04-23 11:16:57,wallstreetbets,Ignore your sunk costs and reevaluate the value of the stock. If it's not moving then you are losing money letting it sit there and hope.
2021-04-23 11:07:33,wallstreetbets,"That's for you to decide for yourself after you consider the reasons for the drop. If after analysis you conclude it is just an outlier and this is a discount, buy more.  If you feel this is an indication the company is suffering then sell. You need to put some framework around the loss percentage and actions you take. For example 10% you ignore. 15% you watch and begin analysis. 20% you cut it."
2021-04-23 08:23:52,wallstreetbets,"I have level 2 options trading and 300+ shares of GME. If I want to sell CCs I have to call in and do it through a broker and pay the $25 fee. I’m not sure why TD is being this way, but the restriction is only with GME. I am able to buy calls / puts though."
2021-04-23 13:07:37,wallstreetbets,Does it show up online similar to if you sold other CC?  Can I buy to close?
2021-04-22 23:41:08,wallstreetbets,He’ll find that the covered call strategy has no premium when the stock is put to him and drops 40% - but hey 72k in income on 100k seems totally doable and easy to replicate long term.  I mean those professional investing clowns that are billionaires and only compound in the high teens or low 20s have never heard of covered calls...
2021-04-22 23:17:42,wallstreetbets,Goals and reality are not always the same. Not going to hit it every month but that's what I push for. The massive market increases over the last year have helped.
2021-04-23 07:25:29,wallstreetbets,"RIDE has been solid lately. I have 10k shares of that currently which is about $100k so it works for this example perfectly. I don't worry about price. I focus on premium income. If it rises above my CC I still profit but don't worry as much about any lost upside unless I know a catalyst is in the near future. Currently I have $11 CCs because the borrowing rate is high and there are low available shares so it could run a bit but normally I do closer to the money. With that said at the current $21/weekly I do 100 covered calls. I will make $2100/week. Multiple by four and I make $8400 in a month off the covered calls. Since RIDE is near it's all time low, the downside risk is lower, but not gone. If it runs, I have a cost average right at $10 so I would also profit $1/share. I also do this with ROOT, UWMC, AMC, and a few others. Rarely do my covered calls get hit. Then after the price runs, I sell puts. In this example I would sell $10 puts... A price I wouldn't mind owning the shares at again. They pay $81 currently. I would buy 100 of them. That locks up my $100k for a week just like shares would. I then profit $8100 OR I end up with the shares again with a cost basis of $9.19. If the don't get executed I keep selling puts until I get the shares. That makes me potentially $32k in a month. So... My strategy is VERY doable with a real example that has played out nicely for a month. Will likely continue. When it stops, I move on. With this strategy I have taken far fewer losses and have had better annual gains. Not financial advice, just a guy who survived ten years as a trader."

2021-04-23 02:07:49,wallstreetbets,Everyone knows you only wheel the fun money. The rest goes into the indices. Or you could yolo and win/lose big
2021-04-23 07:09:19,wallstreetbets,Didn't Warren say he could make 100% yearly if he had to manage small amounts of money? Its totally doable. Realistic is an other question
2021-04-23 08:45:55,wallstreetbets,"@Pondssolo thanks for the detailed explanation, you are great at teaching. I bet your process could be multiplied by others with mentoring. I’m open for entering into a test case, might be fun to teach others who are serious about learning little known ways to bring them closer to financial freedom.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)"
2021-04-23 18:11:54,wallstreetbets,"Do you sell the calls on Monday for the week, or on a Friday for the next week? Or only on green days?

Please teach us Yoda!"
2021-04-23 09:47:43,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-22 21:42:35,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-23 11:25:16,wallstreetbets,You said it in a way that makes it sound like every cent you OWN is going into the market.
2021-04-23 11:27:10,wallstreetbets,"Because it would mean you have no liquid savings for emergencies, job loss etc..."
2021-04-23 14:07:52,wallstreetbets,Nope you can spread them out through an evening.

2021-04-23 12:03:46,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I turned $2 into $110m when I won the power all. I always viewed it as buying an out of the money call with a low probability of payoff, but huge if it hits.  Am I smart or lucky?  Buffett managed small amounts of money in Buffett partners Ltd. he did not have 72% compounded annual returns.  Also, this guy on Reddit is no Warren Buffett."
2021-04-23 08:54:13,wallstreetbets,"It isn't a hard strategy at all. The reason why people have a hard time making money is because they want home runs on every play. Sometimes the better move is to go for the singles. With this strategy you don't have as much anxiety over price because you make money whether the stock is up, down, or sideways with some slight tweaks. Works best with weekly options so you can adjust based on upcoming catalysts otherwise you may have to roll your calls to dodge them."
2021-04-23 18:17:27,wallstreetbets,It depends. Normally I roll the calls from the current week into the next week on Thursday or Friday. If I expect the premium to increase I may wait until Monday to take advantage of higher premiums. Sometimes I will buy the calls back on a dip and wait a few days to sell the new ones. You have to pay attention to premiums and be flexible to maximize profits.

2021-04-23 11:29:44,wallstreetbets,I mean... of course not? I didn't realize I had to qualify stuff like that but yes. Not EVERY cent. But to reiterate. I have no money in my savings or checking besides whats required.
2021-04-23 11:33:42,wallstreetbets,Yup I don't believe in any of that... Besides the HSA I do have one of those.
2021-04-22 21:38:51,wallstreetbets,I heard DFV is actually Tim Apple
2021-04-23 18:32:30,wallstreetbets,do you use yahoo finances or something similar to find out about catalysts or whether a stock could be interesting to be checked out?

2021-04-23 11:36:21,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, some people yolo it all away. Nothing can be assumed when idiocy is so widely available on the internet. Glad to hear you’re keeping what you need to survive"
2021-04-23 13:02:10,wallstreetbets,"Dude, there are literally people who have leveraged credit cards and skipped rent to yolo a play. So you can't say something like that and say ""of course not""... We don't know you or how retarded you might be."
2021-04-23 19:26:16,wallstreetbets,"I look for stocks that are at or near bottom first. If you pick stocks at the top theoretically they have further to fall. I like stable companies that are due for a turnaround, which is why I like ride, root, uwmc, mvis (before it ran), even bigger plays like Ford or GE just to name a few. You want a company that has lots of volume and could move quickly on news but not one that is barely surviving. I also prefer weekly options but undervalued stocks like UWMC and ROOT I make exceptions. 

I then look at sentiment. That means making sure there are enough people long and excited about it that there is a community on reddit, Facebook, wherever. I want a stock people are passionate about. They tend to have good volatility and good premiums... Like RIDE. The longs are crazy passionate. After that I narrow it down with financials, product research, and really deep diving the company to find reasons I don't want to be in it. If it passes all that it goes on the watch list where I watch it for a few weeks. I want to see how it trades. Does it dip in the morning does it rise at night. Do I see accumulation or ladder attacks. Is there anything unusual. I want to know what I am up against so I can figure out when to buy in. I usually do my first purchase by selling ITM puts or slightly OTM puts. Gives me my shares at a considerable discount OR I make premium while waiting. This is why I tend to scout well before another play is done. I want to really understand it and it takes time to get in position. 

With all that said... You need to not be a paper handed bitch! The share price doesn't matter if you are in a stable company. GE isn't going out of business. Don't trade it like it will. The price could drop in half... Doesn't matter... You are making money on the covered calls, you just adjust accordingly. The more premium you bring in, the better your cost basis and the more aggressive you can be with the covered calls. Again, I don't worry about upside because that isn't a guarantee but the premium is. If it runs, great I take premium plus the profits and do it over again selling puts. Most importantly... Remember that these trades are usually longer. They aren't quick flips. Sometimes a run happens but I don't focus on that because I make more as my cost basis gets lower and lower with each expiration."
2021-04-23 11:56:02,wallstreetbets,Alright alright thats fair.
2021-04-23 13:41:41,wallstreetbets,Imagine arguing what quantifies as going all in. Holy shit you're stupid.
2021-04-23 13:51:04,wallstreetbets,How TF do you get riding margin and maxing out CC out of what I said?
2021-04-23 14:29:51,wallstreetbets,"All I'm saying is the guy was right, we don't know what ""every cent"" means because it varies from person to person"
2021-04-23 14:56:27,wallstreetbets,When I'm talking about my money I mean MY money. I never once hinted that I was riding on credit. If anyone took that away from my comment then that's their problem. I shouldn't be called out over assumptions. That's rediclus.
2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Peloton (PTON) Sued Over Tread+ Child Safety 
2021-04-22 21:05:24,wallstreetbets,"there were 22,500 treadmill injuries in 2019.  2,000 of which were kids under 8 years old.  

17 deaths between 2018-2020"
2021-04-23 09:04:13,wallstreetbets,I'm still trying to get my head around why someone would want to pay 4K for a treadmill in the first place.
2021-04-23 10:55:10,wallstreetbets,What’s the actual bull case for PTON? They sell expensive treadmills?
2021-04-22 21:32:48,wallstreetbets,I'm guessing the kid walks in while the parent is using it with maybe headphones on. If you've ever tried to workout with a kid in the house this is frequent. I can maybe do 3 pushups before the leaches are on me.  Kid probably got sucked under when approaching from rear? Seems like there should just be a rear guard for this? Not sure never used one.
2021-04-23 01:59:01,wallstreetbets,God this makes me angry. Put your fucking children outside or in their crate and make sure your animals are in their pack and play.
2021-04-22 23:31:45,wallstreetbets,"Lame.  Same risk as all other treadmills, pay attention to your kids."
2021-04-22 23:20:41,wallstreetbets,Ofc adults abuse and don’t use correctly Peloton tread but i dont understand why pton dont put or even don’t admit that they planing toput at least software fix it is easy as fuck to do it. It is one day of dev and qa work but it is better to claim it is against terms of use ... blablabla. With increasing peloton tread numbers it is matter of time to have similar accident.
2021-04-22 20:03:01,wallstreetbets,What do you expect from a woman who's husband buys her what is basically a 5 thousand dollar hampster wheel?
2021-04-22 21:49:02,wallstreetbets,"Canoo GOEV has a class action for fraud, but mods deleted my post on it. Good to be able to see some news posts get approved."
2021-04-22 22:32:19,wallstreetbets,"Totally, and completely fucking ridiculous.  

Seems like it's the parent's fault to me.  And, in fact. It IS THEIR, THE PARENTS, FAULT, NOT PTON.

So fucking sick of this fraudulent ""projection"" from mentally SICK people.  Fuck these useless idiot morons. 

Doubling down tomorrow.  We LOVE OUR Pelaton as LONG time fitness freaks.  Somehow our dogs and grandchildren NEVER get hurt on ours.  

I may buy another one, cause sometimes the wife and I want to ride together. In fact, our 4 year old Granddaughter loves to ride too.  

Fuck these mentally ill losers.

Rant <end>."
2021-04-22 20:10:36,wallstreetbets,Ah yes... who didn’t realize treadmills weren’t actually giant toys for kids to play on
2021-04-22 22:39:10,wallstreetbets,"Wow, I’d pay money to see the moment that retarded kid realizes, years from now, that his mommy sued a company because they were too fucking stupid to not kill themselves. Also, epic burn from mommy, outs her own kid as an idiot in the legal sense of the word. 

But in mommy’s defense, she has to hustle up some retirement money because we all know that little dimwit ain’t gonna take care of her when she gets old."
2021-04-23 03:53:11,wallstreetbets,This will hardly have any impact on the stock price

2021-04-22 23:30:34,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I was looking at the chart thinking it was going to bounce twice and bottom and try the top again. Then again as a company I don't know if there are many catalysts to look forward to."
2021-04-23 13:25:51,wallstreetbets,"Going to guess they don’t feel safe walking in their area.

My home area is considered high crime barring the exact location of where I live (by the police department). There are no sidewalks at all and we’re framed in by highways. I could see someone dropping money on one here.

Then there are disabled people who need to walk but can’t risk not being able to make it back. I knew a guy who got a stair-stepper for his wife when she was recovering from her hospital stay. About 30 minutes every morning and no worry about her plummeting down an actual set of stairs."
2021-04-23 19:18:01,wallstreetbets,"It's the best treadmill I've ever run on.

Love handles are still there. But then again so are my option losses and I still do those."
2021-04-23 11:11:56,wallstreetbets,The bull case is that people with a lot of money are dumb as hell and will drop insane amounts of cash on prestige garbage that functions in the exact same way as something 1/3rd the price. To be fair it’s a strong case
2021-04-23 12:17:27,wallstreetbets,"No, their bikes are the more popular item. They sell a subscription service where you can workout along with a instructor and other people. It's not like a traditional excerise machine where it's a one and done deal where the profit is from the machine itself."
2021-04-23 14:11:21,wallstreetbets,They sell software subscriptions like every company. $15-$40/month.
2021-04-23 15:00:36,wallstreetbets,"I'm not investing in PTON rn but this lawsuit will not harm their bottom line other than via perception. I believe they have a safety key like every other treadmill and warnings about leaving it active with unattended children 

I feel bad for the family but I don't see much legal responsibility from the company. Maybe they'll pay out a small settlement to avoid sensational news"
2021-04-22 22:34:11,wallstreetbets,And OBVIOUSLY this IDIOT woman isn't an adult. I hate losers.

2021-04-23 05:43:14,wallstreetbets,Lol wtf
2021-04-23 15:58:10,wallstreetbets,Great treadmills though.👍
2021-04-23 15:30:07,wallstreetbets,Yeah but you can look on Craigslist and people are practically giving away treadmills. They buy them then use them to hang clothes on
2021-04-23 00:23:52,wallstreetbets,"It's actually really easy with the Peloton. There is literally a safety key which, when removed, disables it."
2021-04-22 22:59:13,wallstreetbets,More like a flat deck. Maybe just underneath? Dunno treadmills seem dangerous with kids for sure. Kids are dumb. Hair getting sucked in seems easy.  Probably shouldn't be in the room.
2021-04-22 23:00:18,wallstreetbets,The issue is the kids being pulled underneath though right? So a bar underneath would do nothing to impede the range of motion of the foot while preventing things from being pulled under.
2021-04-22 20:02:49,wallstreetbets,"I mean, my kid crawls in the washing machine all the time. As a parent, I don’t turn it on."

2021-04-23 07:32:01,wallstreetbets,"That's your choice.  I said I have a Pelaton, didn't say I own their stock. Pelaton is a very good product and I love mine.  As I said, due to this fraudulent ""case"", which is expected in the mindlessly ignorant litigious society we live in today, where everything is always someone else's fault, I plan on buying another one, AND I will buy their stock today. 

This reminds me of that idiot who spilled McD's coffee on herself, and sued McDonald's for her own stupidity. LOL.  Saddest part was the other idiots on court allowing that baseless case in to court, and the blatantly ignorant juror pool awarding anything at all.  

I bought their stock theme day of the ""verdict""..."

2021-04-22 20:08:37,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-22 20:31:50,wallstreetbets,Or pton can literally put the safety piece on that every other manufacturer does. If a car manufacturer made a car with no seatbelts would you say they should just drive safer?
2021-04-22 23:07:39,wallstreetbets,"Oh right, was thinking something that sticks up, not down to prevent child eating treadmill from devouring another toddler."
2021-04-22 23:08:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah wasn't thinking about something that points down. Was thinking something that points up like the back of a pickup truck.
2021-04-22 20:05:09,wallstreetbets,"If they touch it while it's running, does it suck them in?"
2021-04-23 10:47:13,wallstreetbets,"That was easily one of the most manipulated events I've witnessed. McDonalds actually had dozens of burn victims before her, and in fact should have been aware that yeah, their fucking coffee was too hot. Not only this, the woman just wanted them to pay for the 3RD DEGREE BURN and they made it seem like it was some dumb greedy moron - woman was totally in the right, and mcds had ample opportunity to fix their shit before getting sued. Instead of paying for the treatment, they decided to make her public enemy no. 1 and ate shit."

2021-04-22 21:24:31,wallstreetbets,Somehow we keep kids out of ovens... most of the time.
2021-04-23 00:47:32,wallstreetbets,Then dont blame someone else for being lazy and not removing the key.
2021-04-22 21:14:09,wallstreetbets,they're doing yoga in the commercial...they're not running on a treadmill together....
2021-04-22 20:13:34,wallstreetbets,Yes exactly...the parent is in the same god damn room to supervise her child.
2021-04-22 21:00:46,wallstreetbets,peloton has a safety key.  they are also building out software protection.  do you want them to raise your kids too?
2021-04-22 21:29:58,wallstreetbets,"can you send links to this safety piece that ""every other manufacturer"" puts on?

from what i've googled, sounds like you're just making up nonsense"
2021-04-22 20:12:43,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, haven’t let them find out. That’s called parenting. But I do know I don’t let them stick their head in it when it’s running. There happens to be a bit of responsibility that comes with being a parent. Unfortunately, that means taking accountability when our children do something they shouldn’t, especially when it can be avoided in multiple ways. 

Truly don’t want to come off as ignorant to a young life being lost, I’d be devastated if something happened to one of mine and I feel terrible for that family, but this isn’t the forum for that. PTON will be back above $140 by year end."
2021-04-23 11:00:32,wallstreetbets,"You have it exactly.......in reverse, and because that's what your TV told you.  I spill coffee on myself, that's my fault, the temp is irrelevant.  That's the point you clearly missed. 

And your TV blew it up on McD's just like they are doing now, somehow accusing PTON over a negligent mother or father.  

Inverse the ""media"" always."
2021-04-22 21:05:15,wallstreetbets,I'd like them to put the guard on the back like everyone else so shit doesn't get sucked under
2021-04-22 20:18:06,wallstreetbets,You watch your kids so closely they aren't allowed to go in the laundry room? Yeah right.
2021-04-22 21:12:00,wallstreetbets,Everyone else doesn't even have the guard so I don’t understand your argument. Why aren’t you attacking other companies

Honestly do the math yourself before you judge me, do your OWN DD. This company is fucking valuableable if, you can’t see it- go to an ophthalmologist. I’m not a financial advisor and I can’t support anyone if they go broke yoloing into this stock. I own 2,200 shares of this bad boy"

2021-04-23 00:00:26,wallstreetbets,So not one of you MVIS bulls has read the 10-K and noticed that MVIS essentially had 0 revenue last year meaning it’s highly highly highly unlikely they make money from MSFT hololens?
2021-04-23 17:09:08,wallstreetbets,GME was fun while it lasted. Great short term play on the gamma squeeze but it has zero catalyst. MVIS has a shit ton of catalyst through the rest of the year. We cud literally gamma squeeze this until the company gets bought out. It has a strong base of OG’s and the tech is disruptive. THIS IS THE WAY!!

2021-04-23 01:13:38,wallstreetbets,"Any idea if this contract will affect Q1 earnings?

I don't know how big business dealings work so I guess I'm just wondering if Microsoft landing that contract automatically meant Q1 earnings for MicroVision? 

The contract is for something like five years with possibly another five, right? That leads me to believe the entire cash amount isn't paid out initially, but over time.

I get that it's MVIS tech in the Microsoft Hololens, I'm just wondering how/if that contract would be reflected in MVIS Q1 earnings?"
2021-04-23 07:49:16,wallstreetbets,The biggest news everyone is waiting for on that date is the lidar they have a result on that and when they say “it’s exceeded expectations” Cramer will see our rocket ship on the moon.

The decrease in contract revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was attributed to decreased contract activity because the contract with our April 2017 customer was completed in 2019.

2021-04-23 00:50:55,wallstreetbets,"Microsoft put down some sort of prepayment in 2017. They call the their “2017 Customer”. They make royalties on the unit but it’s not super significant. The main play here is lidar, the Hololense part comes from a separate product vertical"

2021-04-23 03:58:57,wallstreetbets,"> Any idea if this contract will affect Q1 earnings?

Probably not. Too soon.

What is most expected as a catalyst is some sort of update about how the testing of the Lidar preproduction samples (A-Samples) is going. They have been demoing it beind closed doors for the month of April. Ofc they will not be able to say much because of NDAs, but some update to shareholders will probably be given."

2021-04-23 07:25:31,wallstreetbets,"There’s a subreddit called mvis. It’s a bunch of mvis shareholders spreading articles that give them confirmational bias. He just got the info from there. 

Not gunna lie. I had mvis shares ans reading that subreddit makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. But I sold at 14$. Sick and tired of not selling things in my portfolio that are green and end up bagholding. So I said listen up. 40% profit in a few days is a great fucking return. Be happy with it and next time buy calls pussy."
2021-04-23 06:33:51,wallstreetbets,Completely genuine. If their earnings are April 29th and the earliest call expiration for MVIS is May 21st that’s probably the best play. As of now it’s a pretty low volume stock so there might not be enough volume to spark interest for the June calls as of yet but that could change if it picks up more momentum into May and June. Sort of tells you that it’s low volume too since their expirations are like once a month(usually there every other week). I’m also retarded too so take it for what it is.
2021-04-23 01:07:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they’re 100% guaranteed to not go tits up. Basically free money. 0 risk if you go *deeeeeeeep* OTM. 

That or it’s the soonest expiry for options🤷🏻"
2021-04-23 14:39:31,wallstreetbets,My MVIS order never went through either 🥺 stupid premarket skullduggery. Now I need a new DD.
2021-04-22 20:57:39,wallstreetbets,True ! I am being conservative so I am extra happy when it happens.
2021-04-22 22:27:58,wallstreetbets,I would. $30 would be just fine with me
2021-04-23 11:13:55,wallstreetbets,"Yes indeed my entry was first very high as I bought it years ago at $40 (due to reverse split, it was $5 before). Then last year once it was confirmed they are in Microsoft Hololens I sold almost every other stock I had and went heavy with average of 2.80.  I’m holding until buyout which I believe is going to happen by end of July for around $30. But now that the apes are United, we can go way higher :)"
2021-04-23 06:45:16,wallstreetbets,"Well half the “DD” I see claims that MSFT or FB will buy them for $10B for their AR technology.  They received $1.7M total in 2020 in royalties. 

Also - The decrease in contract revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was attributed to decreased contract activity because the contract with our April 2017 customer was completed in 2019. Our contract backlog, including orders for prototype units and evaluation kits, at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was zero


IF MSFT is the 2017 customer they no longer have a contract with MSFT."
2021-04-23 14:27:09,wallstreetbets,"The 36% increase today could be that pricing in.  It could be a buy the rumor, sell the news type deal.  Long term I'm bullish on the company.  Short term I'm just a dumb ape."
2021-04-23 16:38:11,wallstreetbets,"This was exactly what I was thinking, thanks for the confirmation bias!"
2021-04-23 16:38:28,wallstreetbets,"This is wonderful clarification, thank you!"
2021-04-23 11:42:00,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna lie, I was kinda sweating bullets when I typed it but hubris wouldn't allow me to google if the context was correct. You're awesome for this comment 🤣"
2021-04-23 13:08:38,wallstreetbets,I think it was like $50m or something. It was mentioned explicitly in the last earnings.
2021-04-23 11:46:27,wallstreetbets,Been wearing it since I was 3

2021-04-23 08:23:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I’m not believing it personally. But I’d wager it’ll end up around $40 maybe $50 (assuming a buyout happens)"
2021-04-23 07:38:09,wallstreetbets,"I did the same, $10 2 days ago and sold for $13.60 yesterday. 

This move came sooner than expected! I thought we would see some red before the May announcement but i'll take 30%!"
2021-04-23 08:08:13,wallstreetbets,"I respect your decision.  We all have an ""out"" so to speak. But short rate percentage being what it is and 0 short shares available on fintel? That's not a ""I need to sell time"" for me. That's a ""go into a coma and wake up rich"" sign for me."
2021-04-23 08:25:44,wallstreetbets,"You sold at $14?? Why? It’s not a question of if it’ll go above that. It’s a question of by how much.

Yeah, I understand just not wanting to deal with the stress. But you could easily waited to at least $20"
2021-04-23 01:26:26,wallstreetbets,"May 21st is the earliest you can buy calls.  

Premium would be the cheapest compared to June."
2021-04-23 17:56:12,wallstreetbets,"Ugh, that sucks. Hopefully you get a chance to buy in before it flies much farther."
2021-04-23 07:18:22,wallstreetbets,"So when the military wants new Hololens devices, and Microsoft runs out of ones that have the chip that MVIS provides, what will happen then? The chip is patented, it's not like MSFT can get it elsewhere.

That's why people believe that MSFT will buy out MVIS, due to it being a lot more streamlined to just be able to build it themselves rather than pay contracts and royalties"
2021-04-23 09:20:59,wallstreetbets,The $22 billion contract Microsoft just got with the US army uses MVIS tech in the Hololens which hasn't kicked in yet. Not to mention what other contracts Microsoft will win in the near future with such a flagship customer.
2021-04-23 14:33:59,wallstreetbets,"If I had money spare I'd spend it on mvis calls, good luck bro"

I will set my expectations low, but be happy with whatever I get."
2021-04-23 13:57:03,wallstreetbets,I value it at 5 to 10b and that is still a 2x to 4x of the current price
2021-04-23 01:28:39,wallstreetbets,Yea I'm an mvis bull but that's fucking dumb as hell lol
2021-04-23 03:17:55,wallstreetbets,What does this mean for retards
2021-04-23 08:39:22,wallstreetbets,"Well, I'm no future reader, but I can say what I do know - the people who bought at 10 and sold at 13 yesterday are going to be very depressed next Thursday."
2021-04-23 07:43:10,wallstreetbets,Now we sit back and watch as it goes to 40 per share since we sold. Fml. If we didn’t sell it would be 5$ by now.
2021-04-23 09:21:19,wallstreetbets,There is no guarantee it’ll go to 20. It may. It may not. If it was guaranteed then it would be at 20 already. I’ll buy back if it dips back to 11 or under and repeat hopefully.
2021-04-22 22:23:24,wallstreetbets,Explain the MVIS jump in January/February then genius.
2021-04-22 20:36:00,wallstreetbets,Anything is a suppository with enough cottage cheese and willpower
2021-04-23 01:29:07,wallstreetbets,I’m sorry I was joking
2021-04-23 09:34:24,wallstreetbets,Er MSFT clearly isn’t using MVIS technology  in their hololens. MVIS literally said so in the filing. Read it.
2021-04-23 09:32:32,wallstreetbets,No it doesn’t. MSFT produces hololenses now. They are not using a MVIS component. We know this because MVIS said so in their filing
2021-04-22 20:37:18,wallstreetbets,I would like to cordially invite you to lick my ass
2021-04-23 03:51:01,wallstreetbets,You don't know what confirmation bias is? We have such a low bar of entry nowadays. I bet you leave the basement and have a healthy relationship with your wife's boyfriend.
2021-04-23 14:18:07,wallstreetbets,It went to 18 today. There’s a good chance of it reaching $20 by earnings report
2021-04-23 16:25:49,wallstreetbets,"It’s insane that you don’t think its a guarantee it’ll get to $20.

I’m much less sure it’ll go that low again. It might. But it will DEF get to $20. Prob next week of not today."

2021-04-23 16:38:38,wallstreetbets,I mean obviously in hindsight it sucks. But you’re delusional on what your concept of a guarantee is. If it was guaranteed it would be $20 months ago. Or even today. Yet it’s not. I wish I would’ve sold high but
2021-04-23 01:43:22,wallstreetbets,lmao
2021-04-23 09:48:23,wallstreetbets,"Explain this from the company.

2021-04-23 03:55:20,wallstreetbets,It's a number
2021-04-23 10:21:56,wallstreetbets,"2019 wasn't zero. You left part of the quote out.""Product revenue backlog at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was zero and $6.7 million, respectively.""

Continuation of the deal after 2019 (dated March 2020) :[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/31/2009578/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-Agreement-to-Transfer-Component-Production-to-its-April-2017-Customer.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/31/2009578/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-Agreement-to-Transfer-Component-Production-to-its-April-2017-Customer.html)

I've been browsing but can't seem to find it as it was a question on a shareholder call IIRC, but the above should again give you further evidence that the deal didn't end in 2019, just the initial contract did.

That's enough proof methinks, if you still wanna double down on what you said before then it's pointless I waste any more time."

2021-04-23 17:08:04,wallstreetbets,GME was fun while it lasted. Great short term play on the gamma squeeze but it has zero catalyst. MVIS has a shit ton of catalyst through the rest of the year. We cud literally gamma squeeze this until the company gets bought out. It has a strong base of OG’s and the tech is disruptive. THIS IS THE WAY!!

2021-04-22 22:28:17,wallstreetbets,It could be either cash or share swap or a mix of the two. For every $1B MVIS sells for we get ~$6.50 per share. So a 10B buyout would be ~$65 per share payout

>""It's good to be a bull during a bull market, but nothing compares to being a bear during a bear market"" — Warren Buffett

  
Greetings, honorable WSB citizens. I've been playing with SPY and indexes recently, and it led me to formulate an interesting outlook on the current state of the market. I am really curious about what [noble WSB gentlemen](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/) have to say on all these findings, so feel welcomed to engage in the discussion upon reading the post.

Compulsory, this is not a financial advice, and I am not an advisor - more than that, I am almost confident that I don't even know what I'm doing.

&#x200B;

P.S. Commenting ""Stonks only go up"" as a counter-thesis is perma 🌈🐃  


# I. The Abstract

&#x200B;

The main purpose of this work is to provide a technical counter-thesis to the current market craze, and to spark a constructive discussion. As it was mentioned in the post title, the tools that were used for creating this TA on SPY include: market cycles analysis, for setting a suitable framework; Elliot waves theory as a method of ordering major market movements; Fibonacci retracement for identifying the key, magnetic support and resistance levels; and a sweet 150 moving average to predict the potential bottom of the bear market. These tools will also be given a deeper explanation in the beginning of the discussion, for a bigger circle of WSB participants to wrap their brains around the technical factors at play. If you consider yourself to be a trader with sufficient technical knowledge and skills, feel free to skip the part II. The third part will be focused on the technical data accumulation, based on the historical examples from different time periods, and for different markets types. Part IV is the juiciest, as it incorporates the thesis formation through the application of all the data accumulated in the process of the analysis. V is a bonus part. Without further ado, let's get started.

&#x200B;

# II. The Technical Core

&#x200B;

1. **Market Cycles**

[S&P 500 example is used to illustrate market cycles: orange rectangle highlights accumulation phase, blue - mark-up, turquoise - distribution, and red stands for the mark-down](https://preview.redd.it/8hqda630diu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0c94fecc97785e480b47ef1a6a36448edf7edf8)

Cycles appear in many aspects of life; ranging from the very short-term, e.g. the life cycle of a June bug, which lives only a few days (like an average WSB participant's portfolio), to the life cycles of planets and galaxies, which take billions of years.

No matter what market the reference is being made to, the phases are usually not too difficult to identify, and these are cyclical: rise, peak, dip, and then bottom out (and not rise, rise, rise, and rise as many financial experts here strongly believe). As the consequence of the cyclical nature, when one market cycle is finished, the next one begins.

To see how this works on the financial markets, check the SPY cyclicality on the chart provided above (and for a deeper explanation of each phase, just duckduckgo 'market cycles' and click the first link - this should do well).

&#x200B;

2. **Elliot wave principle**

[Impulsive 1-2-3-4-5 \(purple\) and corrective A-B-C \(burgundy\) Elliot waves applied to the Silver 2019 bull rally and the subsequent correction, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/3159lojsciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6325a7df3af7ffa1a9f4e9d92c045e19cec5517)

Good old Elliot! The smart accountant guy, cherished by many technical traders, created his analytical tools as far back as in the 1930s. He discovered and developed the principle that a market moves according to collective investor or 'crowd' psychology, swinging between optimism and pessimism in natural sequences (which can be analyzed with the application of structural wave patterns). Such sentiment swings result in patterns evidenced in the price movements of markets at every degree of trend or time scale (akin fractals). 

The wave theory is a complex subject in itself, with many advancements and different wave structures. For the purposes of this analysis only the core principles of impulsive and corrective waves patterns will be used, in order to not over-complicate the process. The fundamental idea behind the Elliot principle is fairly simple, follow Wiki explanation, applying it to the example chart above (Silver):  


>In Elliott's model, market prices alternate between an impulsive, or motive phase, and a corrective phase on all time scales of trend. Impulses are always subdivided into a set of 5 lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of waves 1 and 3. Corrective waves subdivide into 3 smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. Motive waves always move with the trend, while corrective waves move against it.

Furthermore, each wave has its own additional rules and guidelines, which will be mentioned later in the analysis. What should also be noted at this point, is that Mr. Elliot was careful to specify that these patterns do not provide any kind of certainty about future price movement, but rather, serve in helping to order the probabilities for future market action.

&#x200B;

3. **Fibonacci retracement**

[Fibo application, NASDAQ weekly chart: pay attention to how the price action plays nicely with the Fibonacci levels](https://preview.redd.it/0ur1l80kciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1f45c8fab9bf03f9daebaf9054b2952f9571ee7)

Leonardo Bonacci is another important name for any technical trader. It is no wonder, because Fibonacci retracement, as a method of technical analysis, is considered to be one of the most popular techniques for determining support and resistance levels. The Fibonacci retracement tool plots percentage retracement lines based upon the mathematical relationship within the Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci retracement is based on a core idea that markets will retrace a predictable portion of a move, after which they will continue to move in the original direction. Again, follow Wiki explanation, checking out the NASDAQ chart above:   


>Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points on a chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios. 0.0% is considered to be the start of the retracement, while 100.0% is a complete reversal to the original part of the move. Once these levels are identified, horizontal lines are drawn and used to identify possible support and resistance levels. The significance of such levels, however, could not be confirmed by examining the data. Arthur Merrill in Filtered Waves determined there is no reliably standard retracement: not 50%, 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, nor any other.

  
And that is the case! From my own experience, there is no ultimate, universal, favorable to the market Fibo correction level, applicable to all the charts and time-frames. However, as it will be observed and discussed later, many of the cycles' examples addressed will point at 61.8% and 78.6% levels, that is worth keeping in mind.

&#x200B;

4. **150 Simple Moving Average**

[The same chart as in the Fibo example, but here the 150 MA is applied; as it can be seen, the correction bounces off it](https://preview.redd.it/dnjkrx9eciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b819b20afea7aef8363cc6ce06e5f8a3e773a33b)

The simple moving average (SMA) is a straightforward technical indicator that is obtained by summing the recent data points in a given set and dividing the total by the number of time periods. In trading, the moving averages are used to identify the direction of a trend, as well as potential support and resistance levels (and that's how it will actually be utilized in the thesis). It can be computed for different types of prices, i.e., low, high, close or open - and personally, I usually work with the close price.

Moving averages are a matter of personal taste and preference. For example, for the short term trades and analysis I use 21 moving average, and it works like a charm. The MA that is of an interest for this technical thesis - is the 150 close simple MA. As for the long term trends, it seems to work as a strong correction magnet for the bears' run, as well as an ultimate support for the long term uptrend, as you should see yourselves in the examples that follow.

&#x200B;

# III. The Historical Examples

&#x200B;

Allrighty, now lets play with some of the major market cycles examples, applying the TA techniques described above in order to identify potential parallels, similarities/differences and to accumulate some data before jumping to the current SPY cycle. All of the charts in III are monthly charts.

&#x200B;

1. **Dow Jones 1994-2003**

https://preview.redd.it/eiw0sae6ciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad8f837d4135ce4d2caf2f24bcdd3052fae477d0

Starting with the cycles, the pattern is fairly obvious: accumulation (always highlighted orange) in 1994; followed by the upward trend (that is the mark-up stage) 1995-1999; what should really draw your attention here, is this fat and long distribution phase, in turquoise, lasting for about two years (this is exceptionally long, as will be seen with other comparisons); the cycle is closed with the year and a half long bear market, that is the mark down phase.

Then, take a closer look at this beautiful motive phrase wave that resembles a perfect TA book example. For the purple impulsive 1-2-3-4-5 wave there are, always, three cornerstone parameters, that have to be confirmed in order for the wave analysis to work out properly:

&#x200B;

* Wave 2 never retraces more than 100% of wave 1 (✅)
* Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three impulse waves, namely waves 1, 3 and 5 (fat ✅, 3 is fucking huge here)
* Wave 4 does not overlap with the price territory of wave 1 (✅✅)  


Then, the most interesting piece, the bear market. Several observations to be made here: A-B-C corrective wave looks fairly ordinarily, though, typically C wave exceeds A wave to a good proportion, and in the current scenario A and C look almost like twins; the due attention should be paid to 150 MA, which acted as a strong support in this case, creating the foothold for the next accumulation phase and subsequently turning the bearish market into a bullish one. The MA acts together with the 61.8% Fibo retracement - another strong supportive factor.

*Overall, a good example of a balanced market cycle with the exceptional distribution phase + interesting Fibo 61.8% and 150 MA tandem support play for the bear market bottom.*  


Now, starting from the next chart, I will only concentrate on the crucial points. Which means, that you should do your wrinkle-less brain a favor and go through the following checklist off your own bat: identify and analyze the cycles; come back to the DJ 1-2-3-4-5 wave criteria if necessary and practice applying it to the other charts; check the Fibonacci retracement, how it fits and how the waves play with it - many interesting discoveries to be made in that relation. And finally, pay a lot of attention to bear markets: how these start, the steepness, A-B-Cs development, and how Fibo and/or MA save the day. It is also a good idea to apply your own technical outlook spidey senses and compare the charts provided. Feel free to share the findings!

2. **DAX 2003-2009**

https://preview.redd.it/0q3k1608diu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c19967cfe7e52d271716ab4190ad7fc1db41205

Going further, lets take a look at DAX 2003-2009 cycle. Remember the checklist, run through that quickly yourself: cycles stages, waves, Fibo and MA.

When analyzing the growth stage manifested by 1-2-3-4-5, *take a note of the first wave, that kicks 78.6% Fibo, and is temporarily held by it - this happens often, and is easily identifiable on many of the exemplary charts. Pay closer attention to the play and the structure of wave 1 here, as it really is a good example of how it should look*. Checking 3 and 5 then - these are big, fat and extensive, and the muscular bulls are to be given credit for that.

What I also feel like pointing at, is the demolishing A-B-C correction, orchestrated by such as muscular bears. The impulse itself is extremely steep, and the full structure resembles a cutthroat dagger - literally, figuratively, visually and even in fucking vibes. Wave A almost touches 38.2% support, B wave bounces from it with a Jedi flick, and is reversed by 23.6% (*take a note of A💛38.2%, B🧡23.6%*) into a dagger blade C wave. The bears are so powerful at this impulsive C wave correction stage, so they are able to crush through 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 150MA altogether, only to be stopped by the support of a last resort (not without a fight), that is 78.6%. Next, the eight month consolidation (re-accumulation) was happening under 150MA and in between 61.8% and 78.6%, just to powerfully revert the price action back to the bullish trend, and the next bull run started. *It can be said that the 150MA, 61.8% and 78.6% played as a delicious bait for bears, for which the three were almost torn to shreds, but hedl.*

One more thing here. Comparing the current example with the A-B-C wave from the DJI example above, the following point has to be mentioned. If you may recall, A and C in DJ were almost identical. With DAX, C is how I like it. *Remember, C is typically at least as large as wave A and very often extends to 1.618 times wave A or beyond* \- which is the current case.

*Important Waves TL;DR: 1💙 78.6% Fibo, while A💛38.2%, and B🧡23.6%. C🗡*23.6%/38.2%/50%/61.8%/150 MA while 💙*78.6% (check the other charts for these points).* 

&#x200B;

3. **GOLD 2005-2016**

https://preview.redd.it/xdf6ducxziu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb241f0f72a2d1fc6038a25e40dceceba552ab85

The next chart to look at is a famous gold rally. Another important parameter of 1-2-3-4-5 is worth mentioning at this point: *2 and 4 usually have the following interdependence - if the second, corrective wave is flat, the fourth wave tends to have a sharper structure and vice versa*. This principle is illustrated and supported by the chart above. Furthermore, take a look at 3 and 5, which are massive again. This indicates that the bulls are really powerful in this cycle.

Talking about the A-B-C correction, it can observed that again A💛38.2% Fibo. Moreover, this time the retrace level magnetizes the price action firmly, so that the subsequent B wave and a substantial part of C wrap around 38.2% level. The three year correction phase morphs into the accumulation, which is supported by the 50% retracement. Interestingly enough, the lows occurring during this consolidation follow the slope of 150 MA, signalling its supporting power.

*Overall, we see a powerful bullish trend, followed by a relatively lengthy distribution phase, followed by a mild correction to 50% retracement, which proves bulls to be fundamentally strong in this market. Even though 150 MA seems to act as an invitation to bears initially, at the end of the day it is on the bulls side, protecting 61.8% and 78.6% from the bothersome honey lovers, and making them scared just by its look alone. And yeah, almost forgot, 1💙 78.6% Fibo.*

&#x200B;

4. **WTI 2002-2009**

https://preview.redd.it/la6h991b0ju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80537e5a774b8bc3814b19a36565d388f4aa994d

Ooh, the fifth wave looks just crazy on this chart, and that is in the nature of volatile markets such as WTI. There are several points of interest for the reader in this example. The noticeable one, is that there is no obvious distribution phase on the chart above. That is, again, the nature of volatility - *sometimes some of the markets are moving too fast, not leaving investors a chance to unhurriedly close their positions (or giving a very short window). There is a chance for the thesis to play out similarly, so let’s take a note here*.

A-B-C here is pure art, so hardcore that there are no green candles (on 1M chart). It is difficult to imagine how fun it was to be a bear throughout this correction. As a result of such an intensive move, it is difficult to identify and separate the waves here, but not impossible. Analysing A-B-C: A💛38.2 again, whereas B is almost nonexistent, which probably should also be attributed to the volatility. C, in its turn, is a masterpiece of a bear creation: it pierces 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6% and the 150 MA altogether (*the latter two again act as a sweet spot for the bears to touch down throughout the whole correction phase*) with a sequence of three lethal red candles. Brutal.

*Yet again, 78.6% Fibo and 150 MA save the bulls’ asses and reverse the bearish trend. And how about this observation: if A💛38.2, then it is fair to say C💙61.8%/78.6%💜150 MA - again, check the other charts for that assertion.*

&#x200B;

5. **HANG SENG 2003-2009**

https://preview.redd.it/jpnskc4k0ju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16732da18c67e65b3ddf59048c95a188a231561d

Hang Seng, Konnichi wa! Interesting chart of another volatile market, with several major similarities to the previous example: powerful 3 and 5, microscopic distribution phase, A wave piercing 38.2%, C behaving almost identically as WTI C in relation to 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6% and the 150 MA.

Additionally: 1💙78.6%; B🧡23.6% - never forget!

*Also, what I noticed to be a common characteristic for the majority of examples here: the tougher 3 and 5 are, the more severe correction follows. Check this point out on the other charts!*

&#x200B;

6. And finally, the thesis's grandfather **S&P 500 1995-2003**

https://preview.redd.it/jidh8gfq4ju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=201f78a3a268c62c8bd52d758dd569d58b2c257b

This is the last one before SPY thesis explanation, I promise! Also, this historical example has the biggest weight among all of the discussed here, because this is the direct predecessor of the current cycle.

To begin with, 1💙78.6%. You may find it funny, or mocky that I refer to that often, but this one is a crucial point to help with the Fibo application for the thesis later. Next, 1-2-3-4-5 checklist ✅ (refer to DJI for that matter). Solid wave 3 and wave 5, which also tend to correlate with the severity of the bear phase - and again the correlation is confirmed in this cycle.

The distribution phase lasts for about 7 months, allowing plenty of time for investors to fix their profits, before the powerful A-B-C correction starts (looks a bit like DAX dagger). You may notice that A💛38.2%, and B🧡23.6% again, and these prevailing patterns will also be among the cornerstones for building the thesis. C wave, in its turn, while breaking through 61.8% Fibo retracement, gently touches 150 MA to complete the mark-down phase. 150 MA subsequently acts as a sound support for the next accumulation phase, after which the market reverts back to the bullish consensus. 

The price action elaborated in the second part of the previous paragraph yet again serves as a strong support for the proposition that *a) during a bear market 150 MA coupled with 61.8% or 78.6% plays as a reference point for the bears to aim to; and b) 150 MA + 61.8%/78.6% never (at least in the examples provided) let the bulls down in the long term*.

# IV. Dr. Bearlove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bear Market

&#x200B;

Hooray! If you've read the whole thing and came this far, you are an exceptional WSB citizen of focus, commitment and sheer fucking will. If you just jumped here for the most juicy part, I should strongly encourage you to at least check several examples from III, as these are helpful in understanding what tf is going on here (I hope so).

Diving deeper now, I decided to separate the thesis into four parts: applying the core analysis and the data accumulated to 1-2-3-4-5, as the first (1) step; (2) explaining the A-B-C wave parameters of the thesis based on the historical data accumulated; and then (3) providing additional context to back up and explain the starting point of the mark-up phase (the orange triangle's nose, on the chart below) - please take it take for granted for now; while the last piece of puzzle incorporates the elaboration of the distribution's and A-B-C's duration (4).  


[The Thesis Restated](https://preview.redd.it/3zyw4s3tsju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58a0b02a76265ae06da11d0225cfe16e19bbcd40)

1. **Fucking Finally**

Remember 1💙78.6% (and DAX wave 1 explanation)? This is what originally gave me a hint of where to start looking for the proper 1-2-3-4-5 application. Before identifying this structure, I attempted to apply waves and Fibo to Mar 2009, or Oct 2011 as to the starting points, and these just didn't fit. Several mindfucks later I noticed that June 2013 \[elaborated upon later in ⬇️(3) in a very great detail, I promise!\] is the actual 1-2-3-4-5 initiation point, and it all started rollin'...

Fibonacci retracement coupled with the Elliot wave theory, when applied properly, may well be used as a beacon shining the light on the timeliness and the necessity of a correction. In my opinion, the thesis illustrates that metaphor incredibly well, just by showing how precisely the technical framework fucking fits this SPY lab 🐁. Take a look how adherent the price action is in its interaction with the Fibo levels (e.g. the lengthy consolidations below 78.6% and in between 50% and 61.8%, or 23.6% clearly acting as a resistance during 4). But most importantly, check out this gorgeous Elliot waves 1-2-3-4-5 pattern, which is either completed already (my bet), or will be done in the not so distant future. Let me elaborate on all of that.

Staring from Fibo and wave one, this time the price action surrounding apex of wave 1, wave 2 and the beginning of 3 💙78.6% for about 2 years! If this is not a true love, then I don’t know what is. Wave 1, in this case, is a very solid incarnation of the traditional 1 structure: soft, relaxed and unhurried. Additionally to that, 1 looks similar to four other examples in III, particularly DAX, Gold, WTI and Hang Seng.

Next, let’s recall an important principle regarding 1-2-3-4-5, discussed in III:3 (Gold), namely: the structures for the second and the fourth wave usually alternate in the following interdependence - if the second wave is a flat correction, wave four tends to have a sharper structure and vice versa. Take a look at the thesis chart again: like in a fucking Raffaello slogan - more than a thousand words.

The final step to do is to go through the 1-2-3-4-5 golden checklist, introduced in III:1 (DJI):  


* Wave 2 never retraces more than 100% of wave 1 (just ✅)
* Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three impulse waves, namely waves 1, 3 and 5 (✅)
* Wave 4 does not overlap with the price territory of wave 1 (✅, however, with a minor remark: vertical 4 was really close to breaking the rule in this case, but... Elliot \[or JPOW, if you are a fundamentals guy\] intervened just in time for the bulls)

Is it fair to say that the confirmations provided above ere enough to support the thesis in relation to 1-2-3-4-5 and Fibo? I would say yes, but what do I know? What is your opinion, fellow expert?

&#x200B;

2. **Stonks Only Go Up, (Except for Retracements)**

[One more time, for the sake of convenience](https://preview.redd.it/ax2isvnikru61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12e75efe538cee76f0fa852f89ff85417099cfa7)

Now, let's discuss the most ungrateful part. Ungrateful, because the chances are, well, that markets will shit on your TA and forecasts, even if a lot of effort was put into it. So what, I am not a fucking pussy to stop trying and learning.

Anyway, this is how I got the A-B-C projection parameters. Again, based purely on the historical data accumulated. First things first, A💛38.2%, and at this point it is an understatement. Please, refer to III and check the charts. Seriously, do not be lazy, it is worth it. Because you will notice that A wave gravitates to 38.2% on all of the examples analyzed, to a great extent. Especially, check the grandfather (III:6), which weights at least twice as much for the thesis, compared to others (perks of being relatives). B wave, in its turn, retraces to 23.6% or above in 4 cases out of 6: DJI, DAX, Hang Seng and the grandfather - which is sufficient to assume that B🧡23.6%, imho.

Oh yeah, wave C. It was stopped by 50% Fibo once (Gold), twice by 61.8% (grandfather and DJI) and three times by 78.6% in DAX, WTI and Hang Seng. Also, it has been evident through all of the examples, that C has a fetish for 150 MA, and it is mutual. These factors, after being summed up, weighted, and distilled - point at the zone between 61.8% and 78.6% Fibo. And guess what? The grandfather's C landed just there. Noice.

&#x200B;

3. **Fat, Ugly Cup Konsolidation**

[The chart above represents a longer term outlook on SP 500. The price level of 155 played as a holding back factor, before being broken through in the middle of 2013, which resulted in the current bull run.](https://preview.redd.it/z7lvx4trlku61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=642d73ee2883b1b1c2fbee13c493df4c171d0edb)

As it has been mentioned, it was difficult for me to identify where to start the wave count for the thesis. Before I zoomed out, and saw this ⬆️. F.U.C.K is how I named it.

Fuk, I just wanna go sleep, so take this short explanation. Based on the previous cycles and mark up to mark down historical proportions: 63/22≈2.86; 48/15=3.2; (3.2+2.86)/2=3.03.

2021-04-23 00:30:57,wallstreetbets,"I am not well-versed in technical analysis, so apologies if these questions are stupid.  First, how do you account for the fact that the S&P500 both changes composition and is also not a randomly selected sample?  Whatever is observed is, by definition, not cycles that exist in a given selection of securities, but in different securities packaged based upon factors which would absolutely be expected to be strongly correllated with the observations you're trying to make.

Once that is accounted for, presuming it is, how do you factor in the fact that this is a market whose largest participants are very likely to be causing exactly the movements being observed, observing these movements, and responding to them, causing further movements, and both the visibility, the movements possible (or just plausible), and other factors have changed dramatically over the time periods being examined?  (Think moving from physical ticker tapes to nearly instantaneous price numbers, are the patterns very clearly simply scaled to shorter timeframe given that the reactions must necessarily be?)

>The same chart as in the Fibo example, but here the 150 MA is applied; as it can be seen, the correction bounces off it

And if you doubled the width of the time period?  You can trivially make it look like a moving average is 'bouncing off' a correct by just picking your time period, especially if you're not even centering the period around the inflection point.  How was the time period chosen?  What does it look like if you take the 150 data points with 75 on each side of that 'bounce'?  Does it still look like a bounce?

Also, if you roll back the exact same methodology, say, 50 years, and move forward with it, how accurate is it?  What would your analysis have said 6 months ago?"

So yeah, the market is on thin ice and so is the american economy, I think trying to print more money to stop the next crash will lead to hyperinflation of the us dollar, they should probably just let it crash. 

Thing is, most crashes need a catalyst not sure about dot com, but 08 definitely had a catalyst, the only thing I can currently see as a catalyst is either joe implementing stricter taxes on wallstreet or something that causes some rich mfs to pull out, causing a snowball. Or something public happening in the current america-china cold war. Who knows, I do hope the market is allowed to crash a fair bit before the US says they'll step in though, we're basically caught between a rock and a hard place, if the next crash is eased, hyperinflation is likely, if it's not another great depression might happened.

2021-04-23 08:59:55,wallstreetbets,"Obligatory  🌈🐻 emoji. Great now that that's out of the way I may have figured out the catalyst for the drop or maybe the reason why stonks are going to fluctuate in a channel near the top before dropping...either that or I'm clinically proven to be retarded.

So the Biden tax plan for raising CGT on the rich is the catalyst. Why?

I looked at some Fed data + a few research papers on wealth distribution and investing habits and the result was that the top 1% (who would be fucked by that tax) hold roughly 38.6T $ in assets. It's estimated roughly 25-38% is in the stock market (I assume the rest is either in some boring shit like bonds or something illiquid like land/real estate) and 75% of it is in taxable accounts (if you earn like 2m+/year there's only so much you can dump in retirement accounts).

So that brings us to a total of 9.65T-14.6T of US stocks held by those in the top 1%.

Now the question is wtf would you do in preparation of a tax jump after a 12 year raging bull market if you were rich, succesful greedy? I would personally sell at least a part of my holdings to take advantage of the lower taxes and whatever is left in my brokerage account at the end I would keep as unrealized gains until either someone lowers CGT again or I lobby someone to lower CGT. There's no way I would sell any investments once the higher tax rate kicks in and I think this is why we'll have another bull market straight after the drop.

Which brings me to the final point. The $ amount of daily volume across all US exchanges is 10T and when buy & sell side volume is the same that's where stonks don't move. How much would you need to move it by 1%? Well only 1% extra pressure from the sell side assuming buying is at normal levels so you'd need to sell 0.1T in one day.

Bringing me all of this back to my initial point. That 9.65T (which is actually the lower estimate) is very fucking illiquid and the more people panic the more illiquid it becomes. If you wanted to only sell 1% of your holdings you would have to do it in 30days+ to not raise any suspicion (you'd only be 0.2% of daily vol), to sell 5% you'd need to do it in about 60days. 

Obviously this means everyone else is going to cooperate and only sell small amounts of their holdings daily, right?

Well I doubt it. We all know finance is one giant shark tank. It's just a matter of whether all the big boys affected by the new taxes are going to think the same and whether their timing is going to overlap. That's probably also the moment all the 🌈hedge funds start to smell blood in the water and short.

When is it? I don't know, sometime this year. I need to do more math to figure out how many days you'd need to sell 10-25% of that amount. Would you sell now if you were rich? What proportion of your holdings would you sell? Do you think I'm overthinking this and the rich are going to shrug this off?"

Btw none of the Citadel subsidiaries has more than a quarter per cent of their holdings in short GME positions. Idk about other IBs but probs similar holdings. So how the hell does a position so small affect the market? It doesn't.   
Ik this is gonna get downvoted cuz it goes against the narrative that GME is the centre of the stock universe but pls tell me why I'm wrong in replies"
2021-04-23 09:34:46,wallstreetbets,">I mean everybody has been thinking that the negative beta of GME means that it does better when the market does worse

...that’s what beta means 

 >but I am convinced that the rest of the market does worse when it does better because the shorts have to pay more interest and thus have to liquidate their other positions (i.e. GME's price has a direct effect on the market at large due to linkage by Shitadel and friends).  I am expecting a really nice discount on other stocks that I plan to buy when GME moons.

2021-04-23 00:27:16,wallstreetbets,"The closest analogue to what we are seeing today is the dot-com bubble.

Lots of new tech where ""old"" rules of valuation supposedly no longer apply, combined with lots of liquidity, and lots of cash still on the side.  That bubble didn't crash all at once, it took a few years to unwind.  So I agree, this won't be 07-08 where all of a sudden the sky will be falling.  Like you said lots of dips, dead cat bounces / fake recoveries, violent sideways action.  The whole thing took almost 3 years top to bottom.  I actually wonder if it's already started or will start soon and we won't even know that we've peaked.

It will be much harder to be like Burry this time, where you just wait for a sign of things cracking and take one giant bet and print on the way down."

I have a problem with the entire premise because the entire market crash and recovery was completely artificial. The crash last February was caused by a preemptive shutdown of the economy, not by destruction or overheating of fundamentals. The recovery was fueled by JPow's printer, but again, there was no fundamental problem with the economy that needed to be fixed. The artificial solution of printing was for the artificial problem of the shutdown. The engine of the economy was turned off and is being turned back on again. All the analysis OP shared I consider fascinating and educational, but I just don't see how it applies to today's market. Unless something happens to interrupt some of the many macroeconomic tailwinds we've enjoyed for the last decade (and a pandemic only caused a blip), I don't see the bull market ending anytime soon."

You are paying $30 per $1 of earnings.  If for any reason, income ever ends up flat and doesn't keep growing (yes it does happen, in fact companies sometimes lose money or earnings shrink), you're basically getting a return on capital of ~3%.  When high quality bonds begin to rise to 5%, what rational investors would take these prices?"

2021-04-23 06:50:22,wallstreetbets,"But you're just wrong. Negative beta is exactly that, ""that the negative beta of GME means that it does better when the market does worse"". Positive beta says that the stock prise corelates with market movement, beta of 0 means there is no corelation between market and stock, and negative beta means that the stock has inverse corelation with the market, so if the market is going down, the stock should be going up. You can argue about how acurate the calculated beta is, but there's no arguing what negative beta indicates."

2021-04-22 21:31:37,wallstreetbets,I look at these kind of posts and always wonder if people work full time jobs enough to make these “bets”’ or have they made way more $ investing and are using their gains to buy calls/puts. How can ya afford to lose more than $5 without getting hurt like me ?
2021-04-22 21:21:46,wallstreetbets,You'll get some of this back on open.

2021-04-22 23:49:52,wallstreetbets,It means they're down 69%
2021-04-23 07:59:15,wallstreetbets,That is the price of the contract x $100.  So $120 per for the 755 Calls and $528 for the 730 calls.  He bought 19 @$120 and 11 @ $528.

2021-04-22 21:48:20,wallstreetbets,I wish you massive luck and good fortune. I’m also bullish on TSLA and hope it hits over 800$ like a few months ago. Scared money don’t make money but losing 8k would give me anxiety and want to kill a 5th of Henny to drown the pain.
2021-04-23 12:31:05,wallstreetbets,What price would he have needed to see to at least break even
2021-04-23 00:13:20,wallstreetbets,Sometimes you buy the dip... and... well... sometimes the dip buys you dude
2021-04-23 18:30:30,wallstreetbets,Lol it’s true though! I have a whole watchlist called “Big Ticket End of Week Movers” that I only start looking at around then.
2021-04-23 12:43:33,wallstreetbets,He actually lost $18k 🤣
2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,PSFE looks relatively undervalued. Guess I’ll throw some dollars at it

2021-04-22 20:16:28,wallstreetbets,Love this bet
2021-04-22 20:25:56,wallstreetbets,Show me some PSFE earnings and I'm in!

2021-04-23 00:20:25,wallstreetbets,i got 10k on this. if it hits 5$ i will drop another 20-30k
2021-04-23 12:03:46,wallstreetbets,Dude the down trend is real. Look at the charts
2021-04-23 00:08:35,wallstreetbets,Honestly I agree it will be much higher at the end of the year. But I'm bearish (though I hold 1.7k shares at 13.50) due to the lockup expiry that will execute on June/July. Blackstone and cvc own 46% of the shares. They'll sell most of it and it will tank so buy at the dip and then hold. Right now I'm buying puts at 12.5 and 10 since the selloff will be huge. Not saying it's not undervalued but the short term private equities will rip in the short term.
2021-04-23 11:33:31,wallstreetbets,My puts gonna pay off 😊
2021-04-22 22:12:02,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-04-22 20:56:56,wallstreetbets,"I'm trying to figure out the mechanics of buying warrants. Which platform do you use? 

Google has me chasing my tail just providing a definition. Ugh"
2021-04-22 21:53:33,wallstreetbets,"I’ve traded warrants for awhile during the big SPAC craze. Had nice returns, but I like these a bit more."
2021-04-22 20:53:23,wallstreetbets,"I’m in PSFE with shares and calls.  The story with PSFE is that it is undervalued when compared to fintech peers.  

It’s taken down with the other SPACs, but there is reason to believe this is one of the few legit SPACs. 

Conservative valuation compared to peers is $18-20 but others are looking for upside to 40’s.   It’s not a get rich quick play.  They are going to have to hit earnings a couple of times to get the SPAC stink off of them."
2021-04-23 00:19:51,wallstreetbets,all spacs tanked
2021-04-22 21:58:25,wallstreetbets,Hope we make some money!
2021-04-23 12:07:54,wallstreetbets,"I have and I think the company is undervalued. I make investments based on my own research. If I’m wrong, that’s fine."
2021-04-23 19:51:14,wallstreetbets,"bruh wtf??? buy low sell high, Be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy you looking to buy at a high price you gonna play with the price is low are you stupid"

2021-04-22 21:20:24,wallstreetbets,Fidelity has them. Definition is way more difficult than necessary on warrants
2021-04-22 21:39:38,wallstreetbets,"PSFEWS on fidelity. PSFE+ on others. PSFE.WT on yahoo finance and other brokers. You buy Just like buying shares on your brokerage platform, just use the warrant ticker. Treat them as long term options without theta and IV decay. Although they will almost certainly be redeemed by the company prior to their 5 year expiration (stock must trade above $18 for 20/30 trading days before they can be called). Research warrants and read the S1 if you are curious how they work. Warrants are an amazing play here. I’m jacked to the tits on them."
2021-04-22 22:01:26,wallstreetbets,"I’m not too concerned about earnings. This is a longer value play. Depending on how it goes, I’ll trim or add. Hope we make some money!"
2021-04-22 20:45:48,wallstreetbets,"A bit undervalued?  For your options to even break even, let alone make you any money, it will have to go up over 100% in 6 months...  a “bit”?"
2021-04-22 21:55:22,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I agree. I just felt this was a great entry point for these contracts so took a swing at it. Not an earnings play, but depending on how it goes I’ll trim or add. Eyeing another 250-500 more."
2021-04-23 12:12:41,wallstreetbets,I like the company too. Just not undervalued just yet. Trying to time this would be catching the falling knife.
2021-04-23 14:11:07,wallstreetbets,"To be fair I hope it’s you, I have $10 at risk and you have a lot more. I just shit posted before"

Looks like I have a lot of researching/reading to do. This sounds like a great addition to my trading toolbox.

First few years were rocky, but as long as you are learning from your mistakes, you eventually become a better trader! I like to stick to my research and decide when I sell for gain or loss before I enter a position. Can’t be right all the time, but I do like being right."

2021-04-22 21:23:57,wallstreetbets,Some wealthy dudes get a few million dollars and IPO right away for the purpose of doing a reverse merger with an existing company
2021-04-23 12:14:55,wallstreetbets,Hey it’s the nature of the game. One person sees it as undervalued now while another sees it as overvalued. Guess we will see! Hence why I went with October calls. Gives me plenty of time to reassess my position if needed.
2021-04-22 21:51:55,wallstreetbets,Would be real nice if I’m right! God speed to the both of us!
2021-04-22 22:08:44,wallstreetbets,"yea a plan is key...and when that doesnt work, theres always stop losses"
2021-04-22 22:02:09,wallstreetbets,"Today...

If it trades flat, or down tomorrow, he’ll already be negative on both.

If held to expiration, his $20 calls will lose 100% of his investment if it doesn’t go up over 50%.  It needs to hit 55% just for him to break even, and not gain or lose anything.

For his $30 call lol.  That’s the worst.  Over 130% is what the stock has to go up for that contract not to expire worthless.

If this stock is flat by June, he’ll have lost 50% of his money lol.

I don’t know about you, but if I was that confident in the stock, I’d put $20k in shares or $20k in options that are already in the money.

He’s risking $20k hoping it goes up over 60% just to break even at expiry.  Insane."
2021-04-22 21:28:17,wallstreetbets,My ape brain can’t comprehend that basic explanation I’ll check it on YouTube 😂
2021-04-23 12:57:15,wallstreetbets,"Nice move, rooting for ya!!!"
2021-04-22 20:59:38,wallstreetbets,Words of wisdom
2021-04-22 23:05:20,wallstreetbets,how long out? assuming you got fucked these past two months?
2021-04-22 22:10:21,wallstreetbets,"Yessir. I try to stick to that pretty religiously. GameStop was for fun. I still hold a sizable position because it’s been fun to watch, but it’s not money I can’t afford to lose. Still rooting for us!"
2021-04-22 22:05:15,wallstreetbets,"Bruh,

No one holds til expiration or even close to that unless they’re extra retarded"
2021-04-22 22:27:56,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think you understand how American options work. But hey, not saying I’m going to be right, I just did my own research and felt like it was undervalued. Guess time will tell."
2021-04-22 21:34:08,wallstreetbets,Lol godspeed my dude
2021-04-23 12:57:37,wallstreetbets,Thanks bud!
2021-04-23 00:19:23,wallstreetbets,"6 months,  yea peaked in Feb"
2021-04-22 22:34:30,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, yes people do.

Bruh, his options expire in October, and I just said if the stock is flat by June, which is what, 6 weeks from now, he’ll be down 50%.  The stock has to be up 20% by the end of June just for him to be even.  So if in 6 weeks that stock is up 20%, he STILL will not have made any money.

Is that clear to you, BRUH?"
2021-04-22 22:29:14,wallstreetbets,"LOL fuck you.  I don’t know how options work?  Hold those fuckin options to expiry, and then come talk to me.  The way I explained it is EXACTLY how it fuckin works."
2021-04-23 09:16:24,wallstreetbets,same lol
2021-04-23 03:45:54,wallstreetbets,I think I just peed myself a little
2021-04-23 01:03:08,wallstreetbets,Thank you! Finally calling out the stupid echo chamber/circle jerk that this place has become for careless gambling addicts. People losing real money thinking they’ll hit the lottery with the next paycheck. Get back to your desk job and 401k people.
2021-04-22 22:30:25,wallstreetbets,If I wanted to execute them. I could’ve sold them today for a profit if I wanted to?
2021-04-23 09:17:48,wallstreetbets,You still holding?
2021-04-23 02:06:48,wallstreetbets,"Actually the idiots are people who don't seem to understand implied volatility.

A stock can trade COMPLETELY flat but if IV rises while you are long a position the premium goes up and you can make profit regardless of if a stock moves at all."

Holy fuck you’re retarded 

LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL

Motherfucker did your dumb ass just say I didn’t know how options work, and then you go and say you can execute these right now for a profit????  LOOOOOOOL

If you executed these, you’d be paying $20 and $30 per share for a stock that is currently $13 a share.

How in the fuck do you think that would be profitable???  😂

WOW 🤡"
2021-04-23 16:22:54,wallstreetbets,"yeah with IPOE, bought lower strikes and some of the dip, really fucked me though with the IV drop"
2021-04-23 03:23:24,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand how a stock can trade flat but have rising IV?
2021-04-22 23:16:40,wallstreetbets,U don’t belong here if appears you do not have a smooth brain
2021-04-22 22:38:12,wallstreetbets,🙃
2021-04-23 02:10:00,wallstreetbets,"You obviously don't know much about the market but let me explain. If a stock trades completely flat until his expiration but implied volatility goes up during the first half he will make money regardless. 

IV is a very important factor and I suggest you look into it before looking more ""retarded."" And since were already on a platform for smooth brains what does that make you?"
2021-04-23 10:55:58,wallstreetbets,"well lets say SPY increases in volatility but AAPL trades flat.

The increase in SPY volatility could correlate to increase in AAPL volatility without any movement in AAPL"
2021-04-23 13:03:38,wallstreetbets,"Lol you stupid fuck, you don’t buy options hoping the IV is what goes up, dumb ass."
2021-04-23 13:08:12,wallstreetbets,"You are obviously the dumbass. Trading IV, delta, theta, are all successful long term trading strategies that have been employed since the existence of options trading."
2021-04-23 14:49:17,wallstreetbets,"No shit, dumb ass.  That statement doesn’t have to do with the stupid shit you said.  No one.  Literally nobody — buys an option expecting to make money on simply a elevation in IV.

A stock cannot trade flat, and be profitable with high IV.  It’s not possible.  The Theta would be equally as high, and would result in heavy losses if the stock stays flat.  There’s no such thing as a profitable option on a flat stock with high IV.

Doesn’t fucking exist."
2021-04-23 15:31:35,wallstreetbets,I make a shit load selling premiums using IV. Lol you don't have to just buy options dumbass
2021-04-23 16:31:02,wallstreetbets,"Again, what you just said has zero to do with what I just said.

Yes, you make a shit ton SELLING high IV options.  A person BUYING high IV options is 90% likely to lose a lot of money.  That’s literally my fucking point that you’re arguing for me."

The last time it was talked about here it popped quite a bit. I expect as people hear about it it will again.

The cherry is it makes $ and pays a dividend.

I’m biased - have over $200k in stock, calls and ITM leaps so like the OP I’m pulling for blowout earnings. Currently down around $30k."

2021-04-22 22:50:26,wallstreetbets,Oof. I’m surprised you didn’t get margin called on that one. I’m finally in the green after the constant buy ins at 7.30s and 7.40s
2021-04-22 23:34:08,wallstreetbets,I’m averaging down. Let’s go!

 and bought 200  of UWMC at 9.30  and now it just sets there"
2021-04-23 01:41:29,wallstreetbets,"Unless, it is for rental income, real estate is not great. The costs to maintain are high. Wall Street Journal did a study a long time ago and found that renters over 20 years did better.  If you are going to live in it, it doesn't matter you get your own place but pay for it in a forced savings account really.  What we are facing now is econ 101 demographics, the millennials are a larger generation than the boomers and entering their peak buying years whereas in 2006-2007 ridiculous speculation due to 3year 0% rates.  I bought a house when interest was 8.5% and did a variable, which I refinanced later lower, did a study when rates high can't go wrong on variables."
2021-04-23 09:13:36,wallstreetbets,"Are you betting on mortgages or this company?  I only ask cuz I went with RKT (but not yolo-style, my balls are tiny and I like them)"
2021-04-23 16:20:16,wallstreetbets,"Earnings will be good and will remain strong. People follow housing reports and that does not tell the whole story of UWM. There is no respectable mortgage broker in the country that does not work with UWM.  They are very easy to work with, do not over condition the loans and they are fast.  Mortgage brokers are the fastest growing market in the industry and UWM has 34% of that share.  If interest rates start to go higher, that affects mostly retail offices because they have higher expenses and higher rates for clients.  So, those loan officers either become mortgage brokers or start working for mortgage brokers, in both cases it means more business for UWM.  Currently mortgage brokers have 17% market share.  Before the crash of 2008, they had over 30% market share.  Just imagine what the results will be for UWM if mortgage brokers go to 30% market share of a $1 trillion industry and UWM has 34% of that pie."
2021-04-22 21:57:58,wallstreetbets,Would be nice if tax plan passed and stocks sell while the housing market kept going higher and higher with no peak in sight

2021-04-22 20:53:46,wallstreetbets,"It only reported earnings once since going public,  so limited data so far. It ran up quite a bit in the week prior to earnings and crapped out shortly after even after reporting best quarter ever. So if you're itching to get out,  do it on the next pre earnings run up. I think this company stock is severely undervalued,  and after next earnings release it will become obvious that it is the case. I'm holding out for $10+ per share,  but will sell a bit after 20% gain on my position to diversify."
2021-04-22 20:32:49,wallstreetbets,His one trick is building a huge profitable business with virtually no advertising that's been growing for decades... It's a good trick

2021-04-23 09:43:59,wallstreetbets,"Housing demand is still astronomical, the refinance segment is slowing down.  But new home purchases and new home construction is still very strong"
2021-04-23 11:57:51,wallstreetbets,"Lol... the stock has literally done nothing for several months now.  It teetered at $10 then tanked and stayed there.

I can't think of a single reason to invest in this stock over something like AMC which has much more potential if we're discussing short squeezes."
2021-04-22 20:19:43,wallstreetbets,"Wait, seriously? I’ve been doing this all wrong."
2021-04-22 20:53:00,wallstreetbets,Especially with the respectable 5% dividend.  Better than a savings account at the current prices

2021-04-22 21:48:58,wallstreetbets,True. But has he tried spinning? That’s a good trick too.
2021-04-23 11:34:06,wallstreetbets,Housing demand in my area is very high but its more due to lack of inventory. I don't really see how that helps UWMC
2021-04-23 09:56:24,wallstreetbets,"In markets where there is inventory purchases are strong. Uwmc works off of volume, so that is a problem too."
2021-04-23 11:59:37,wallstreetbets,"We’re not discussing short squeezes.

Not every stock movement is due to short positions."
2021-04-22 21:27:30,wallstreetbets,I have been told it is not the way.
2021-04-22 20:56:57,wallstreetbets,"if you held onto investments pre-2008 through now your returns are staggering. if you panic sold like a retard, then you probably had a bad time"
2021-04-23 12:48:50,wallstreetbets,"While the short interest in UWMC is rather high currently, their underlying fundamentals are the real reason to invest.  AMC was losing money pre pandemic, has had to take on massive debts to stay alive during the pandemic, and likely will have to secure more debt or issue more shares to stay afloat.  AMC is a high risk bet, not a sound investment.  Uwmc with it's 5% dividend, profitable business model, and expanding business all points to a higher stock price.  Value investors have been holding back waiting for stability.  It's been added to index funds which requires funds to buy and hold their stock."
2021-04-22 22:28:37,wallstreetbets,"""Staggering?""  [WTF are you talking about?  If you bought in 2005-2006, in most markets, you're just now starting to see gains over your purchase price, in real dollars.](https://cdn.dqydj.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/historical-home-prices-us-1951-2020.png)  Even in nominal dollars, you're looking at maybe 30% over 15 fucking years.  That's an abysmal return."
2021-04-22 20:51:12,wallstreetbets,"How are you an underwriter and not understand their business?  They are the #2 mortgage lender in the nation.  

UWM is a leading mortgage company. They are #2 by volume in the country, after Rocket Mortgage (RKT). They are #1 in the wholesale segment, which means they rely on a network of independent mortgage brokers to generate leads, while they do the underwriting, origination, and to some extent servicing.

UWM, like RKT, is disrupting the stodgy mortgage business through efficiency created by technology, but UWM seems like they’re doing it better.

UWM does it faster and cheaper than anyone in the business."
2021-04-22 22:31:37,wallstreetbets,"I don't think median home price in the US is a great measure. I own properties in major metropolitan areas only, which I think are a better indicator"

2021-04-22 20:01:13,wallstreetbets,"We have that side of it but completely different. I handle large MF, office and mixed use stuff so far away from SFR (single family residence) side. I work on syndicate and investment grade borrowers with tenants like Lockheed etc. By no means am I bragging just that's a different world. My deals take like months and months to close. Two weeks sounds awesome. So many less headaches."
2021-04-22 22:36:22,wallstreetbets,"So do I.  Lots.  Returns from 2005 to 2020 have been nowhere near ""staggering"".  I have a property in SF (worth $3.5m), another in Florida (worth $860,000, that appraised for $690,000 around 2005), another in Michigan, and about to buy another.

Spend some time looking at ""Price History"" on Trulia, and look at properties that transacted in 2005 or 2006.  You'll see that prices paid then do not make for ""staggering"" returns.

Thankfully I didn't buy any of my properties during that time."
2021-04-23 18:06:49,wallstreetbets,Willing to throw me some resources on learning about properties?
2021-04-22 20:07:42,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha, UWM is all confirming 1-4 family originated through a broker network. I work for a CU in the area and we lost a bunch of employees to them over the last year."
2021-04-22 22:45:16,wallstreetbets,Great! Apparently we have different investment strategies. That's okay!
2021-04-22 23:48:46,wallstreetbets,"I'm convinced, buying calls tomorrow"
2021-04-22 23:05:09,wallstreetbets,You made an incorrect claim.  Has nothing to do with strategy.
2021-04-22 23:11:57,wallstreetbets,It has everything to do with strategy. You and I had different returns over the same horizon and asset class. The delta is strategy.
2021-04-22 23:15:20,wallstreetbets,"No you didn't.

And here's your claim: ""if you held onto investments pre-2008 through now your returns are staggering"".

Not *I*, but the general ""you"", meaning anyone.  When no one who bought in 2005 has experienced staggering returns."

2021-04-22 20:13:40,wallstreetbets,"I've been in this stock since it was trading at $2. it's my main play right now. Yesterday it felt like it would really pop, so I sunk another 12k into options during a dip.

How I found it? I saw people on twitter talking about it when it popped from $0.6 to $2.50. I researched it and it seemed like a good play so I bought in back then. Sold when it hit $18, but I wasn't holding that many shares. When it came back down I decided it would go back up again and I've been increasing my position during dips. It's been a rough play that has tested my diamond hands. I'm planning to hold until 25 or so and then I'll take out my initial investment and ride the rest for a bit."

2021-04-22 20:11:30,wallstreetbets,"They are hoping that the FDA will approve emergency use based on Covaxin phase 3 trials that happened in India.

I don't have the confidence that they do.

NVAX on the other hand just started crossover shots after successful phase 3 trials in the US.  They also had successful phase 3 trials from UK that concluded in January(no EUA yet)"
2021-04-23 01:16:22,wallstreetbets,you also have to consider the fact that the study was done with different variants of the virus and also proven effective against the new double mutants

2021-04-22 20:44:23,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I think that's reasonable skepticism and I share it. I plan to limit my downside exposure after they file but before the results come out (sell shares and deep ITM options, replace with ATM calls)."

2021-04-22 20:57:39,wallstreetbets,"That sounds like a great strategy.

I had some, but sold them for a profit.  We haven't approved NVAX EUA on the UK trials that were completed in January yet, so I can't imagine we will see Ocugen for at least 6 months."
2021-04-23 00:11:39,wallstreetbets,"NVAX can sell their vaccine to the world.  Almost 8 billion people.  Potential profit if they get $7 per vaccine at 20% of the population and don't have to share.  $11.2 Billion

Ocugen is in a partnership with Bharat.  Ocugen can only sell in the US (331 million mostly vaccinated people).   They have share their profits with Bharat.  Potential revenue if 20% (60 million) get their vaccine and they get $5/ea(since they have to share)=$300 million

See the difference?

Ocugen may pump temporarily, but the market will correct itself."
2021-04-23 00:14:19,wallstreetbets,CVAC is a good alternative and it will go even higher. Vaccine stocks always dip after they been released.
2021-04-23 11:45:19,wallstreetbets,I'm not getting married to it. This is a swing play. we can both be right on different timescales :)

Track 3 - **Concrete Goonies** \- Invest in infrastructure.

Track 5 - **G.I. Joe** \- Long RTX, LTM, BA, DFEN, NOC. This is an obvious play you shouldn't need Yachty to elucidate for you.

Track 6 - **Never Did Coke** \- This is a short play on KO. Yachty thinks kids are more health conscious now, but his bearish sentiment on coke long-term confuses me. I think they're well positioned for some CBD beverages and healthy drinks.

Track 8 - **Plastic** \- Long oil. This is a recovery play.

Track 12 - **SB5** \- If you google SB5 you get PROFUTURA. This is a bullish Latina futures play. GPROFUT

Track 13 - **Hybrid** \- He's saying short Tesla, as he prefers a hybrid to a full electric. Yachty is bullish on Detroit automakers. He seems to suggest he's made quite the bag off GM and FORD this year while fucking your little sister.

Overall, Yachty invests like a boomer, which is telling. I agree with some of his observations and will be adjusting my portfolio as needed.

They were selling blue drinks there were straight alcohol and there were high school kids throwing up in the corners with blue tongues. Yachty came out looking like Gordons fisherman in those yellow fishing overalls. I was on two tabs and it was pretty magical watching everyone party to some lullaby trap.

When Migos were about to come on, the crowd got crazy. Beautiful expensive women came out of the woodwork. All ass and tits and lips. Then they started making gunshot noises and the cops showed up and kicked everyone out. Spent the rest of the night on the docks in LI city watching Manhattan breathe in the distance tripping balls. We ran into a little spanish street party, with music and food, right near the water. I can still remember the smell of the carnitas hitting. You rarely get hungry tripping but that shit got me straight aroused.

STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES. Microvision holds the key to the revolution that we as investors can only speculate about. Meanwhile, the 800,000-pound gorilla(s) and The Sharmanator + Best In Class BOD have ALL the resources needed to realize the MVIS potential. I have zero doubt that HERO Sharma fully grasps the potential and is more than capable of painting a genuine picture of where this ship is going. 

Here's a question. If one tech giant purchased a world-changing company like Microvision, would you or anyone consider that a monopoly? 

Lastly, Judy Curran Moderated the ""Digitization of Product Development"" panel today. If you watch/listen, you would have noticed overwhelming support for teamwork makes the dreamwork sensibility. You also would have seen that our dear Judy Curran wasn't on the panel but instead was the HMFIC.

Forget the buyout predictions. Get your tinfoil hat out and ask yourself how the stock price would react if Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Ford, and Amazon announced their ""strategic partnership"" with our very own, MF'ing Microvision!? I don't know about you, but that event would trigger the ""right value"" for me.  

Good luck sleeping tonight, everyone. The world is about to change, and we have a front-row seat. Imagine riding in an autonomous vehicle with your Hololens 10 on telling your family and friends about the time you were there, the dawn of the greatest YOLO the world has ever seen. The LEGENDS of the GME short squeeze and BEST IN CLASS longs of MVIS came together in UNITYYYYYYYYY

In conclusion, I'm not a financial adviser. Trading does carry risk, ESPECIALLY if you bet against the unicorn of our generation, MICROVISION, ticker symbol MVIS. In Sumit Sharma, we trust!

There are 4 million too few homes to meet demand per Freddie Mac. That’s up 50% since 2018*. Estimates show that even with this past year’s price inflation, homes are only about 5.5% overvalued, most of that number coming from large metro areas. The frothiness is likely to continue and get a lot higher. I think construction stonks will continue to do well; however, supply issues in lumber and other building materials may become worse before they get much better.

I was sitting by the pool reading a book when a tall, very pretty girl (about 20) wearing a bikini laid down on a chaise lounge next to me and began smoothing suntan oil onto her body.

And I watched as she applied the lotion to her arms, her neck, her shoulders, her stomach, her calves, and her thighs. 
She had reddish brown hair that I could almost smell it’s fragrance and I felt as though I was swooning into her when I realized I was becoming so aroused that I had to throw a beach towel over my swim suit.

Now, I don’t know if she noticed this, but after a minute or so she leaned over and told me her name was Donna.

He also thinks that real correction will happen sometime in July. He expects a 1 to 3 year long stock market crash (apparently 2020 crash isn't the real one) once the final melt up phase of the bull market ends.    Not sure yet if July will the the catalyst that will trigger the real crash of if it will come later. So we just have to buy calls in the right stock during every dip through may and june and cash out the profit before July.   Which early play is good for next week? I think PHM is going to do good through May after the earning. Need to figure out a good entry point for strike and expiry.

Last Thursday they announced that the stockholders approved an increase of 95m  to shares. As a result, all of the shares available to short were taken out.

Now, due to efficacy results and impending fda filing, it's increased nearly 100% and the additional shares likely won't be introduced in bulk or in the near term. 

Yet, https://fintel.io/ss/us/ocgn it appears that all shares available for shorting are still shorted and it's a short volume ratio of 35%. I'm not clear on what that really means, as I've not focused on shorting before."

2021-04-23 16:25:28,wallstreetbets,It's probably the best company but worst app.  Fidelity.  Fidelity active trader pro is a great desktop app though.

2021-04-23 02:33:41,wallstreetbets,"This will likely depend on which country you live in, and your best bet would be asking someone within your country who trades stocks how to get set up (primarily suggested brokers). As for not losing it all, only use amounts you're comfortable losing. You can do risky yolo plays that could pay off, but there's tons of loss porn showing how that frequently goes. You could always practice with paper trading accounts first. Good luck."

Or be an ape and gamble money betting ramen or steak."
2021-04-23 02:31:35,wallstreetbets,"Don't spend anything you can't lose. Take patient and small gains at the start to build your base. This way if you lose, you lose small. When you have the hang of it, commit some more money on trades.
Once you feel that you have a good handle on it, learn about options trading 
Best way to lose your shirt is to try and bet too hard, too quickly. Stay off the high stakes table.until you're good at poker."

Just as a comparison and it’s from a similar blood clout issue, so I wouldn’t take Advil if you’re worried about the vaccine. 

That said if you’re worried about dying from a statistical anomaly... Then I wouldn’t get in a car. 1.35 million people die every year in cars worldwide, another 3 million people died of alcohol poisoning as well last year. 

But to answer your question it was AstraZeneca causing blood clouts, but again only 32 people out of the close to 22 Million people that have gotten the first vaccine have died. So you would have a 1-in-687,500 chance of dying from taking the Vaccine. Those odds are like winning a smaller lottery. If you hit on those odds, your ticket was likely up anyway, RIP Bro."

Anyway, at that level you need to try to bulk your abs. Yes I’m talking bulk like you’d bulk your other muscles by doing low rep high weight workouts. This is the key for your six pack to shine through. When your ab muscles literally get bigger, that last bit of belly fat will be more spread out and less noticeable over bigger abs. No more 50 sit-ups in a row. Grab an overhead weight and do decline sit ups such that you can only really do 8 at a time. Also hold a 5 pound dumbbell between your feet and do hanging leg raises. That 5 pounds becomes a killer. Start raising that to 10 or even 15lbs but just whatever it is that only lets you do low reps."

1. This is a proposal, not a bill. It has not been codified into an established position yet. He says 43% now, but like a used car salesman the democrats will cut it down to 33% before it even gets to the floor. 

2. It probably won't pass. Even though taxing speculative investment profits is an *extremely* popular platform with American citizens, the politicians (both Democratic and Republican) have their campaigns paid for by Wall Street. They will pressure enough Sinemas and Manchins to keep any meaningful tax reform off the table.

3. A large portion of liquidity in the stock market does not pay capital gains taxes anyway. Retirement funds like a 401k or IRA make up the majority of Americans stock holdings, and they are taxed as income upon disbursement. They are exempt from capital gains tax altogether"

2021-04-23 04:17:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah pretty much this. At the time when NFLX started doing streaming at scale was a stupidly hard problem. Since then CloudFlare/Fastly and AWS (to a degree) have made a lot of the core streaming parts a lot easier (and content delivery in general).

NFLX at it's core is a cutting edge tech company that employs some of the industries very best. Unfortunately tech isn't going to win them the market.

I think they realised a few years ago that the big players aren't going to allow them to middle man and get big IP at decent prices so they started down the original content route. The problem is that has been hit or miss (as expected). If it works it will create a new enduring media company (not tech company importantly), if it doesn't it will probably get swallowed by Disney.

Disney is the 800 pound gorilla that finally entered the chat. Even in it's first innings it's really throwing its weight around and it still has tons of IP to bring to bear.

HBO Max, Hulu, Paramount+ aren't so much dangerous competition the bigger problem is it reduces access to IP for NFLX."

2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD on MSTR - MicroStrategy  

MSTR is a business intelligence company providing analytics and enterprise tools for companies. Their customers in FY 2021 include Pfizer, ABC, VISA, and eBay.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wlq7ycsn0su61.png?width=1879&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a2436c961b84c31b868f205841c31d69167e705

 

Although it may seem like this is another BI company that has a lot of competitors, MSTR has one unique thing going for it… its coin holdings. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/34dh57m40su61.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=d849f18536c85cb517f2bf097bd9b29cc1f0a7ad

They have 90,859 coins and if we multiply that by the est. coin price on 4/27/2021 → 55,000 -- > they have about 4.25 bn worth of assets. What is MSTR’s market cap right now? 6.2bn as of 4/22/2021. If you are bullish on the coin, then MSTR is heavily undervalued. IF the coin jumps to a $70,000 ATH (could be possible within months)... then MSTR’s assets will increase to 6.36 bn. What is their market cap again? That’s right, whenever the coin jumps high then MSTR will surely follow. Essentially, MSTR is a derivative of the coin. But it’s more rewarding to get in on MSTR because the ROI is a lot bigger than the coin. Calls and shares whenever it dips are the play here. 

&#x200B;

If you take a look at the graph of MSTR, you will know what I am talking about,

&#x200B;

[3 month graph of MSTR from Jan 22- Apr 22 \/2021](https://preview.redd.it/rkrasm5s0su61.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=015a81d6717d6c48f24f5ccea8b7001d3581e2cc)

All these dips and rises. They're by $100-300. If you pick a somewhat floor like $600. And if the bull market for coin continues.. then there is no reason it should not be at $800+ again like the past. 

&#x200B;

Risk: I am not the biggest fan of the coin, however I am a fan of the bull market for it. Big institutions have bought in on this ex: Tesla, JP Morgan, Fidelity, PayPal, Visa, etc... the cat's out of the bag. Is the coin the future tho? Maybe on another discussion, but I doubt it. However, derivatives of the coin (where it falls and rises) I do not doubt. Because the market is overall confusing to me and too many factors are in play for me to consider, MSTR is something that is not. They are a derivative of the coin.  

&#x200B;

Plays: Adding in shares here and there (been burned tho.. so I'm taking it easy with calls). And add in calls for July at the $800-1000 strike. 

 

Positions: 2 @ 639.43. Looking to add more shares / acquire a call for either 4/30 or july.

Edited: added an additional share. 3 @ 627.10 now."
2021-04-22 20:17:42,wallstreetbets,"I played this months ago because MSTR would rip up like crazy whenever the forbidden asset would make moves, but lately mstr's moves have been muted whenever forbidden asset goes uppies. I believe what has happened was that MSTR was being used as a proxy for people that couldn't, or wouldn't, buy said forbidden asset but wanted exposure. MARA/RIOT fall in this category too. Think like pension fund managers or whatever. Now that COIN has ipo'd, COIN is clearly the superior proxy. I wouldn't touch MSTR until whatever money that was using it as a proxy has rotated out, should be clear once the price action starts to mirror forbidden asset once more."
2021-04-22 21:20:00,wallstreetbets,I bought 10 at an avg of $150. Interesting thing to note is the small number of shares outstanding. The price can move up quite rapidly.
2021-04-23 19:08:57,wallstreetbets,"As a fellow coin skeptic, it surprises me that you're willing to take this position. I have a DD in my profile detailing why both MSTR and the coin are a house of cards. They are a stagnant company that's barely generating any revenue ($6.5 billion market cap with an EBITDA of $5.92 million in the last quarter. No, really). Which means if coin prices fall below their purchasing average, they won't be able to repay their debts.  

When I wrote the DD back in early March, there were $36.4 billion in magical pretend USD propping up the coin markets. Now there are $49.2 billion. It's all pretend money pulled out of thin air propping up prices, and sooner or later it's going to come crashing down, taking MSTR with it. The company holds so many coins now, I doubt they can even liquidate their position without tanking prices further."
2021-04-22 23:59:02,wallstreetbets,It has micro in the name. Buy!
2021-04-23 14:38:46,wallstreetbets,I work for a company that utilizes their software/computer gizmos. It’s not really that ground breaking
2021-04-23 02:17:30,wallstreetbets,"You are correct, I am one of those switching to $COIN. The option chain on $MSTR was not very liquid or deep, in spite of its high price/share. 
Also worth checking the institutional owners, it used to be called out that Morgan Stanley owned this but it was misdirected because of total return swaps, just not Hwang lol"
2021-04-22 20:10:51,wallstreetbets,Also have this software in our environment. It’s trash. Would not recommend.

There is no grand conspiracy here, it’s just that this is a sub for all types of stocks/plays, and it was being overrun with low quality GME comments/posts. If the stock moves 1-2% a day (let’s face it GME has been a pretty boring stock the last few weeks) - why does it warrant 10k posts a day? Like what is there to talk about?

I have shares in PLTR and Tesla but I wouldn’t expect to see 10k posts about those companies on days when they barely move and there’s no groundbreaking news"

2021-04-23 17:44:25,wallstreetbets,">DFV started here too

DFV started with OPTIONS. And if you actually read any of his comments on GME (literally in his profile just click on it), he consistently doubted a short squeeze was going to happen (but said it was a possibility). Not FUD - literally his own words."
2021-04-23 15:02:13,wallstreetbets,"It's rare that a subreddit's majority is completely overturned by a single event. Right now the subreddit is 1 to 2 million OG members and 8 to 9 million people who only joined for GME and AMC (myself included). So many people think that WSB is reliant on GME, because that's been the only content for a majority of the members.

Banning discussion of GME won't ""kill"" WSB because it was doing great before and it's pretty much in a bubble right now. It had over a million members before January and it would have at least that many if all the GME-only people quit.

Usually I'm againt censorship, but it might be the mods' only way to get the subreddit back to normal since they're outnumbered. There's plenty of offshoot GME-only subreddits and people who only want to talk about GME should move to there."

2021-04-23 08:29:01,wallstreetbets,"/u/GasolinePizza's completely right though. The initial GME play wasn't about taking down Melvin or whoever, they were just an easy target who got caught shorting way more than float

There are market makers and HFers and others on the street who are and were active members of the sub, openly so

All good as long as the rules are applied equally across tickers.

2021-04-23 03:51:03,wallstreetbets,You could have helped.
2021-04-23 08:48:44,wallstreetbets,Isn't that the reason you mods created a filter to prevent GME posts for people who don't want them visible in the first place ?
2021-04-23 06:38:16,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the answer. Wouldn’t you agree that you’re not putting a thread on pedestal unless you pin it and the rest is solely driven by your users? 

I remember being a moderator for a Torrent forum and the mod team would run polls to get insight on its users before making similar decisions. The idea is to serve the users with the content they already like and not prescribe something they may like. 

Legally, of course you are a mod/owner and you get to decide. But fairly, you should have let your users decide (and not a smaller group of users which you deem to declare better than others). 

At the same time, /r/wallstreetbets sells merch and makes money of its users. This is kind of cringe, brotha."

And have you heard of sleep? Didn't notice that 6 hour posting gap in there? So why exactly would I give a single fuck if you're clocking out?

This whole thing started because you flipped out on me for daring to ask for proof. So *now* you're suddenly caring about proof? 🤡

Go ahead and repost this comment on the one where you actually ask for proof of whatever it is.


And LMAO. ""Talking to other people! REEE!"" You say this shit like you didn't do the same damn thing 12 hours ago when you started flinging shit. Do you have zero self-awareness?

2021-04-23 16:32:45,wallstreetbets,"I'm not familiar enough with it but I'd guess the shorters would be hypervigilant to any other short squeeze movements at this point, and the rules that have gone into play from the SEC another GME scenario would be harder to pull off again.

The tech they're involved in would have to be actually market applicable, I'd be researching exactly what kind tech they produce and how exactly it can be implemented in real world scenarios before I'd invest in it.

If the tech is good it could be a good buy long term."
2021-04-23 13:08:02,wallstreetbets,"probably since it serves as a gathering point for the kind of people that accuse us of shit all day, send me unhinged dms, and concoct conspiracy theories about everything, rather than being about trading options.

Seems to me ur just trying to be an activist short seller, people aren’t really investing in what they don’t know here, they know the company, the people in it, they believe in its future and you don’t. But if you were confident in your prediction you wouldn’t feel the need to spread fud on Gamestop, seems to me you’re insecure about your position and prediction for the future of the company, so you try to insult everyone whose against it."

GameStop has a name. Brand recognition. Retail locations already built out and operating. Even if the company’s identity is completely different 24 months from now, it still is going to cost less, be less risky and have the potential to pay off much sooner than starting from scratch and trying to build a company from the bottom."

My bet is when the economy actually hits hard times soon, Gamestop will disappear."
2021-04-23 01:06:25,wallstreetbets,"A house is useful if the state of it is usable. Gamestop is like an old abandoned house where you need to bulldoze everything anyway. So it makes absolutely no sense to pay for the house.

Retail employees of Gamestop have absolutely nothing to offer to the new company. He needs lots of high end software engineers, not people walking shop floors. These employees are actually a major liability since they will need to be paid to do nothing."

The new Gamestop doesn't need these properties, they're a liability, not an asset.

It's almost always easier to find new employees that match the qualifications. This is why all boards get rid of employees when changing the direction of the company."

After being so wrong about something, you don't get to continue pretending like you know what you're talking about with that same thing. All I'll say in response to you now is, if you're so sure it's a terrible investment, please, dear God please, open a short position in GME and keep it open for three years (if you don't get margin called before then), then post the results after those three years. I need loss porn from absolutely retarded plays like that to get off anymore."
2021-04-23 10:51:19,wallstreetbets,"Its not dilapidated, just needs to expose the hardwood and patch the roof a bit. And no not really, they closed about 1000 stores already and plan to do more. They have 37 years of established  notoriety as one of the biggest gaming retailers ever. You can go almost anywhere in the world and people know it. Starting a brand new business would be way more expensive and time consuming (building, hiring, training). Not to mention now you'd have to compete against an established titan of the industry."
2021-04-23 05:53:57,wallstreetbets,"LOL! The digital presence is only a PORTION of what he's doing. Of course they'll have to hire software developers, but he's also looking at e-sports and expanding the business in other ways. Regardless of what they do, they'll still need a mass of people for customer service and whatnot. Boards don't fire everyone when they change the direction of the company. Some will get fired, some will get retrained, and there will be new hires as well. You make it sound like they're moving from a retail company to something with zero overlap, like growing corn. Did it ever occur to you that they turn their properties into e-sports gaming lounges? I don't know what all he has in mind, but it's not going to be an exclusive digital retail company. There will have to be more, that sets them apart from other companies in the digital retail sector -- and offering a unique in-person experience is one way they could."
2021-04-23 04:57:05,wallstreetbets,"That's separates the smart ones from the stupid. Investing or trading is not a cult behavior, there are no permanent teams.

Until more information about whether the company is failing to meet its goals or is fulfilling them, no one can really justify they’re thought process past this point without it just being speculation."
2021-04-23 15:51:14,wallstreetbets,"Almost anywhere in the world? Not even close. North America, Australia and few parts of Europe are not ""the world"". In fact I had never noticed a Gamestop store before and I have been around US, Europe and Asia. I play games on top of that so it would be something I'd remember. Most of my friends and family have never heard of it.

You seem to compare to the likes of Nike, Adidas, IBM or Pepsi and that's laughable.

2021-04-23 04:59:53,wallstreetbets,Float is irrelevant and so is volume in this context. I'm talking about valuation. Besides the price trend is clearly down at this point. There's a triangle formed if you want to get technical.
2021-04-23 15:51:54,wallstreetbets,"At least you admit it, that's a start."
2021-04-23 13:52:30,wallstreetbets,"Wedges are not as useful when analyzing the stock, the sell-offs and rallies are sometimes inorganic, Price trend can be downward but that really says nothing about the future of the company, stock price is reflective of the company not the other way round, and if the stock goes up or down its simply speculation, because there as been no new information pointing towards the future of the company.

2021-04-22 21:13:51,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand this. Every article I read says they're planning to ""double the tax rate to ≈39-40%.""

The short term cap is already at 37%, so I'm assuming the doubling refers to the 20% long-term cap.

So are they increasing short-term percentage too? Because I thought the point of lowering long term capital gains is to incentivize people to hold assets longer and decrease volatility?

I'm not sure doubling long-term capital gains is the solution. Hold longer = pay 2-5% more? People would just sell off before year end."

2021-04-22 22:38:39,wallstreetbets,"Biden didn't say anything about this recently. 

The Yahoo! article links a Bloomberg article, but the Bloomberg article doesn't state that this quote came from The Biden Administration recently. And when questioning them today, they based their quote of Biden raising capital taxes ""based on a Bloomberg report"".

But what was the Bloomberg report based off of?

This is just Bloomberg bringing to light a proposal made in 2019. Why bring it up now?

What's really going on is that the SEC is more seriously enforcing one of their rules which ensures that all large investment institutions have proper collateral for all their positions;

[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/staff-fully-paid-lending](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/staff-fully-paid-lending)

These institutions are liquidating assets to prepare for margin calls and to provide the liquidity required for their positions. That's what actually going on."

DOW down 6%, UNP down 2.4%, AAPL down 1.2%, AMZN 1.5% etc. 

The extreme wealthy will likely take their profits before the tax hike kicks in but they are mostly invested in large cap anyways (RIP SPY). Initial estimates I’ve seen are a 2k-3k hit to the DOW Jones upon confirmation that Biden will go for this and a Dow Jones 20k - 25k if it does pass. 

I think the small caps will be fine by comparison. There aren’t profits to take in stocks like PLTR yet anyways."

>[Under proposals submitted to tax negotiators from 135 countries at the OECD, the Biden plan would force big companies to pay taxes where their revenues are earned, not where the profits can be shifted to. It would also establish a global minimum tax rate, agreed by the world’s biggest economies.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/11/bidens-plans-for-a-global-corporate-tax-rate-could-make-the-world-a-fairer-place)

Unfortunately even if they ended minority rule in the Senate by eliminating the ability of 40% of the chamber to block all but 3 bills every 2 years it would still be a tough fight to make it go from a plan to real policy:

>Much negotiation still remains to be done, not least on the rate at which a global minimum tax would be set. Washington wants 21% but several nations have much lower rates. An agreement among EU nations would not be easy, as rates range from 9% in Hungary and 12.5% in Ireland to 33% in France.

>Might the agreed rate be so low as to make the initiative meaningless? Might there be too many exemptions?

>Possibly, but the hope is that, with the US on board and a warm reception from France and Germany, jurisdictions hosting a large enough slice of global economic activity will sign – effectively forcing compliance. After decades on the road to nowhere, global tax reform may at last be within reach."

2021-04-23 01:20:19,wallstreetbets,"This is a blanket lie. Norway and Denmark are the happiest places in the world with the largest marginal tax rates. They did this by adopting our tax rates from when we were the happiest and greatest country in the world.

America is supposed to be the land of opportunity for EVERYONE not just a few. Taxing the rich more means they invest their money in their communities and their employees to lower their bottom line and pay less to uncle Sam. This creates expansion. They don't actually pay the tax unless they are really unintelligent. The way millionaires thwart ""high taxes"" is investing in their local communities. I worked for a conservative company and they pay like shit, their products are shit, and the employees are unmotivated as hell, the owners are the shittiest people I have ever known who fire cancer patients so they don't have to deal with then missing work. I have since switched to a fortune 500 company in the state with the highest taxes and I get paid for the job I'm doing finally. They believe we should get paid for the work we do.

People who are actually doing work deserve to be paid. The rest are essentially on welfare. I don't care what you call it. My family left Europe 300 years ago to get away from people making so much they think they are lords and shit. 


If I could pay 50% in taxes to a country that has created a system for anyone to prosper I would. The rest of you need to move to fucking Russia."

Takes, literally, 2 minutes to log-in, setup the ACH payment, and sleep better knowing I won't be getting ass-raped on 4/15, 5/15, or 6/15, whatever the date may be.

We used to have a top tier of 70% for people making over $OMGNOWAY.

How about we learn from our own history?

Worked well enough for 40 years."
2021-04-22 20:40:18,wallstreetbets,Oh...so you just aren't bright. Got it. Well keep your armed revolution away from me.
2021-04-22 22:43:09,wallstreetbets,Good thing this proposal would only apply to gains above 1 million per year then
2021-04-22 20:58:55,wallstreetbets,"Wtf, is this a serious question?"
2021-04-22 20:22:09,wallstreetbets,Those goalposts shifted pretty far from where they started. The fact is that more taxes isn't going to trickle down just like how less taxes sure as fuck didn't trickle down either
2021-04-22 23:08:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they are buying and renting them out lol

smh"
2021-04-22 23:10:39,wallstreetbets,"Uhhh... no. You can reinvest the proceeds into new real estate...

Also, on the other point, you need to live in the home two years, not one."
2021-04-22 20:06:56,wallstreetbets,"It will affect those with an income over $1M. Cap gains are based on total income, not just the cap gain amount.

This affect long term cap gains, so of course more money would flow into real estate as a result."
2021-04-22 20:51:34,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind that's 500k of gains too. A 500k investment sold for 600k is only 100k in gains.
2021-04-22 21:58:02,wallstreetbets,"Imagine being such a moron that you don't understand the point of the original topic. 

Using a 1031 exchange is no different than not selling your long term investments since it is just a tax deferral, so when the property is sold, the gains are taxed at the same rate that someone selling a security.

So, why would an institution move money out of the stock market to invest in real estate for the purpose of avoiding taxes since they could just not sell their long term securities which have a higher rate of return than the real estate?

Eventually, when you want to profit off of it, you will be taxed."
2021-04-23 02:28:21,wallstreetbets,Thanks idk much about this stuff. I guess you could have an international shell company and then only report income when you take it as personal pay?
2021-04-22 21:42:36,wallstreetbets,"1 million income people aren't struggling to put bread on the table, before or after the proposed tax plan. It also means money is more likely to stay in the market rather than leaving at the first sign of trouble. You would save more by leaving those gains unrealized and only taking out what you absolutely need."
2021-04-22 22:55:57,wallstreetbets,"You'd have to be a really stupid business owner to not shelter that with other investments. It's like winning the lottery, you don't take the 50% lower upfront payout unless you know you can make more the depreciation baked into the 20 year payout."
2021-04-22 21:59:19,wallstreetbets,"The one thing you need to know is the largest firms have the largest tax departments for a reason. It's far more profitable for them to spend millions on people to find loopholes, than spend hundreds of millions in taxes"
2021-04-22 20:20:02,wallstreetbets,Which is also subject to CGT?
2021-04-22 21:07:34,wallstreetbets,Hahaha there you go
2021-04-23 15:01:20,wallstreetbets,Just the tip is the motto of my anus when it comes to government  😭
2021-04-22 21:28:12,wallstreetbets,"Bruh they pay less than you or I do and I don't see these rich people going to bat for the normal people. You're the first person they fuck over and they lobbied for a system where **you** are the tax base instead of them. They'll outsource you in a second. Why do you feel compelled to lick their heels and be *their* advocate? They own the lobbies and politicians anyway. lmao

May as well start a GoFundMe for Goldman Sachs. I'm sure they'll return the favor for you ;)"
2021-04-22 21:36:49,wallstreetbets,"No one's jealous lol, I'm saying I don't care and don't see a reason to hypothesize about someone who doesn't know you or I exist."
2021-04-23 09:11:08,wallstreetbets,"Dont cherrypick tax code as the sole reason for the happiest countries, there are multitude of reasons why they are the happiest.

I’m not a fanboy of them, call me cynical, i see the world for what it is. The rich runs the society and write the rules, prove me wrong? You can bash me for wanting to be like them, but you can’t say that’s not how it is.

If you think taxes result in those money ending up in the hands of the poor, you are smoking something. The rich doesnt care about the poor for one second, they’ll find creative ways to shift their money, but not to pay their employees better. Why do ppl constantly fight for higher minimum wages? I think you live in some dream world."
2021-04-23 01:37:48,wallstreetbets,"Dude doesn't even make enough to be in this tax category lmao

Hes just lying. Im an accountant and he sounds really dumb."
2021-04-23 14:30:40,wallstreetbets,Looks like i struck a nerve with all you mein kampf loving democrat fucktards.
2021-04-22 20:36:35,wallstreetbets,Put all your money in ARCX and I bet you'll find out
2021-04-22 20:47:04,wallstreetbets,It means that the heggies needs to have the liquidity as a collateral  for their margins.
2021-04-23 02:05:24,wallstreetbets,Did I shit on my dogs face while she was sleeping? You'll never know cause my dog ain't no snitch!

2021-04-23 01:57:17,wallstreetbets,Unless you buy in an opportunity zone
2021-04-22 21:56:13,wallstreetbets,Maybe--depends on if it's residential (+ other factors around residential properties)
2021-04-23 05:06:42,wallstreetbets,"1031c, you can defer taxes until death"
2021-04-23 09:30:27,wallstreetbets,Don’t have to pay taxes if you never sell your assets. You can still collect the sweet sweet rents and leave property to your children to sell and yolo on FUDs
2021-04-23 06:44:22,wallstreetbets,What are you able to write off with real estate? I was never able to write anything off when I bought my house. Are you talking about mortgage interest?
2021-04-23 09:05:42,wallstreetbets,"Not exactly true. Property taxes heavily weigh in favor toward the wealthy. The upper end of the market is often under appraised meaning the wealthy pay less than they should. Ironically, the lower income houses in HCOL areas are often over appraised - meaning they typically sell for less than they are appraised, thus the poor pay more in taxes than they should. 

Btw this isn’t “tax evasion”. That would be illegal. It’s merely leveraging the rules in place to the full extent to lower you tax implications. Nothing wrong with that."
2021-04-22 22:08:50,wallstreetbets,especially because it means all the members of congress would have to pay millions of dollars.
2021-04-23 03:16:36,wallstreetbets,(Honest question) What difference does it make to taxe personal income instead of capital? Isn't most money for the rich coming from some form of capital gain?
2021-04-22 20:07:03,wallstreetbets,"Maybe baby, then again maybe not 😉"
2021-04-22 20:48:40,wallstreetbets,I’m sure you fun at parties
2021-04-22 20:56:31,wallstreetbets,"You literally saw why today, you dimwit!"
2021-04-22 22:59:38,wallstreetbets,Yes. Because the Wendy's employees raking in 20K a year are definitely going to help market fluctuations with their 0.8279 shares in AAPL and meme stocks. /s
2021-04-22 20:23:37,wallstreetbets,Sis. But much appreciated!
2021-04-22 20:12:06,wallstreetbets,Im talking about Brick and mortar businesses Not hedge funds/capital management. The entrepreneurs are making an investment directly in the communities they live in by providing jobs. Im just saying if you don't incentivize business in your community or state then you don't deserve it. I dont think California is an attractive state to run a business for various reasons. But thank you for your informed opinion. Back to stonks.
2021-04-23 02:26:49,wallstreetbets,What? Primary residence is the home you live it.
2021-04-23 03:12:59,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't really matter where the shell is if you're still a citizen of the US. Uncle Sam wants his cut. You can do some fancy tricks which might fall under the umbrella of tax avoidance, but you have to be careful to make sure you aren't actually committing tax evasion."
2021-04-22 20:08:49,wallstreetbets,$1 MM total income the capital tax would apply or does it have to be 1MM of capital gains before the 40% applies? If it’s the latter that probably doesn’t affect too many people too badly.
2021-04-22 21:50:50,wallstreetbets,No but the tax loss harvesting at the end of the year will certainly hit stocks harder. Twice as hard to be exact.
2021-04-22 22:55:18,wallstreetbets,Dumbass. One million isn't that much money. What do you think we are trying to make here on WSB? Enough money so we don't have to work a soul killing job again.
2021-04-23 04:01:07,wallstreetbets,"Well if you can take 1,000,000 in unrealized gains out now and lose 200,000 or do it next year and lose 400,000 why wouldn’t you sell it this year."
2021-04-23 11:55:39,wallstreetbets,When you tax something you will get less of it.  That is basic economics.  There will be less invested in the market for sure and the retail investor be hurt by it.
2021-04-22 23:11:19,wallstreetbets,How exactly can you do that when you sell a startup? It’s a one time liquidation.
2021-04-22 20:54:05,wallstreetbets,Heard there were some tax loopholes on exchange and on principal residences
2021-04-22 22:58:21,wallstreetbets,"That's exactly what this proposal does?

The overwhelming majority of income generated by the top 400 families is cap gains. This is without question the most targeted tax on the  wealthy that is available."
2021-04-22 21:32:02,wallstreetbets,"I mean that’s just patently false. The top 1% pays roughly 40% of all federal tax revenue in any given year. They pay a greater share than the bottom 90% combined. I’m hoping you’re being purposely ignorant for lolz or something. 

https://taxfoundation.org/summary-of-the-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2020-update/"
2021-04-22 20:42:51,wallstreetbets,"I would be taxed up to 50% of my gains if I made money like that, due to federal and state capital gains tax. If the federal government raises it even higher than it already is, I'd be looking at over a 50% tax on income I make. That's fucking insane, and the opposite of what needs to happen with money. 

Growth doesn't come from the government in an economy. It comes from entrepreneurs and businesses doing awesome shit. Taxing these individuals more isn't going to help the economy. It's only going to inflate Congress' paychecks and contractors. No fucking chance this increases the average Americans' standard of living. 

It turns out, if you want to raise your standard of living, the best way to do so is be worth it, by working and marketing yourself for more pay.

You've clearly never paid taxes, or filed then yourself. Or you're in a tax bracket where the standard deductions let you live barely paying any tax."
2021-04-22 22:41:53,wallstreetbets,Glad to hear some common sense on Reddit.
2021-04-23 10:53:54,wallstreetbets,Youre living in a dream world the things im talking about have 80 years of precedent. You are talking about tea party theories.
2021-04-23 01:29:39,wallstreetbets,"You're really dumb because this only affects people making over 1m per YEAR.

Imagine being an RN and making 150k because its in your employers best interest to pay you more. Yet here you are advocating for George Soros, Nancy Pelosi, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerburg."
2021-04-22 20:51:33,wallstreetbets,Yo didn’t you guys riot at the Oklahoma capitol the other day?

2021-04-23 13:44:09,wallstreetbets,"LOL. Little man, it's all about capital. I have $200k in my trading account. I usually make about 50% return on any given year. Do the math."
2021-04-23 13:46:17,wallstreetbets,that is correct. I get hit with short term gains. i just shelled out 5k to the taxman for 2020. That hurt.
2021-04-23 08:45:29,wallstreetbets,Your mom’s in an opportunity zone..
2021-04-23 12:35:15,wallstreetbets,"Rental income is taxed as regular income which would be similar to this increased capital gain at the million+ yearly income bracket.

But that does point to another element in this equation: pass through corporations and shell companies.

Ultra wealthy types tend to run their $$$ through corporations to tax shelter it. And a lot of these tax reform plans fail to address these huge loopholes.

Hence why an upper middle class family pays a much higher tax rate than a billionaire."
2021-04-22 20:57:05,wallstreetbets,Yea...I dont talk about armed insurrections and taxes.
2021-04-22 21:24:26,wallstreetbets,"scuse me youre saying the market will fall? whos the gay bear here, again?"
2021-04-22 23:03:54,wallstreetbets,The same goes for the middle class people you mentioned
2021-04-23 07:54:57,wallstreetbets,you are equating a tax for million dollar plus capital gains to someone’s wage slave decision
2021-04-23 02:49:19,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and the wealthy also buy rental properties..."
2021-04-23 03:25:53,wallstreetbets,Thanks I'm a ways off from those decisions anyways but thanks
2021-04-22 22:12:58,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm, maybe, I’d have to think on it. In theory you have more incentive to go through the bother of tax harvesting, but the tax rate doesn’t affect your gross net gain/loss, so I don’t think there is a scenario where it would be beneficial to tax harvest with the new rates where it wouldn’t also have been beneficial before; it just might be more worth the effort."
2021-04-22 23:03:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah yeah, we’re all temporarily embarrassed millionaires. Ignoring the fact that we’re talking $1M annual income, not total wealth, sure the goal of the apes is to moon it, but you’re more likely gonna need the tax to pay your welfare after you lose it all and move back into your mom’s basement."
2021-04-22 23:21:41,wallstreetbets,"So? It's the same way Amazon pays zero taxes. Your business LLC liquidated it's share of the asset, if you need to sell the name/brand then create a new outside entity you invest all the cash in.  That company buys, who cares what a laundromat in Oklahoma and a bunch of whatever random stable assets. Now you're the manager under that LLC for those at whatever standard income and take the rest of nonstandard income as a 20% distribution which doesn't have anything to do with capital gains."
2021-04-22 20:17:41,wallstreetbets,"As far as predictability and effects on market, not too different"
2021-04-22 20:53:28,wallstreetbets,I did! I even have put call on znga and may IPSI stocks (that one in both accounts)

2021-04-22 23:11:20,wallstreetbets,"so you just tax the top without changing the tax code they use to exploit.  Then use what ever money you do happen to get to help underprivileged people that is defined by the government making the underprivileged dependent upon the state to survive?

yea can't see how high taxes doesn't result in more massive tax fraud.. and communism for the lower class. non of which solves the issue of why a greater share of the pie is going to the top. 

increasing governmental power increases the amount of people that will corrupt it for their own means. 

this is a pair of keys to distract you."
2021-04-22 21:38:02,wallstreetbets,"Proportionally, they pay a much smaller amount per dollar earned of income than middle class taxpayers. Guess what capital gains tax is lol.

Enjoy giving a bigger fraction of your paycheck than they do to the government!"
2021-04-23 12:15:30,wallstreetbets,"Im talking about theories? Ok lol this convo is becoming pointless, have fun."
2021-04-23 01:33:23,wallstreetbets,"This guy is an idiot. Raising rates for the 1% would make doctors and nurses get paid MORE.

Healthcare facilities would be taxed more for PROFITS so they pay MORE to employees or grow their company to lower that which creates jobs."
2021-04-22 20:27:03,wallstreetbets,Have you seen anything provided by the government? You’ll be wishing your employer provided it again after your first yearly check up
2021-04-22 20:49:45,wallstreetbets,"When they get margin called, it would trigger a margin call squeeze or McSqueeze."
2021-04-23 10:26:57,wallstreetbets,Snitches get bitches? Maybe... maybe...
2021-04-23 14:35:47,wallstreetbets,Lol let's see them receipts then big boi
2021-04-23 12:38:57,wallstreetbets,Yeah that comment was poorly stated. In reality if you truly wanted to pay 0 taxes you would have to make no money on the property. So you would reinvest every bit of rental income into upgrades on the property and 1031 exchange the capital gains into another property and repeat 20x until you own hotels and die and leave your assets tax free to your children.
2021-04-22 20:53:34,wallstreetbets,"It's an investment in the future. Not yours, but who you bought them from"
2021-04-22 22:43:23,wallstreetbets,"If you sell any of those things for an appreciated value, you pay taxes.  Found out the fun way when I off-loaded my massive WH40k collection a few years back.  Once you go over X amount of profit on your ""hobby"", it's taxable like any retail business - you pay sales and income taxes.  If you forget or didn't know about the sales taxes you should have collected, they're on you."
2021-04-22 21:12:27,wallstreetbets,"All are subject to cap gains tax. Real estate (rental property) is the absolute worst because you also get hit with absolutely absurd property tax that costs 3 months worth of rent, then insurance that costs another 2 months rent, then any repairs/maintenance etc you have to set aside = another 3 months rent.... then, if you have a mortgage, guess what, there goes pretty much all the rest! In the end, after praying to break even for decades, you’re lucky enough to have you’re asset appreciate in value, and pay off the mortgage, and you sell it guess what, now Uncle Sam will take 40% of that too, not 20%.... stocks are a cakewalk... and you don’t have to babysit them and constantly work on them, and you only pay 1 tax instead of a never ending stream of taxes, fees, headaches etc that just ends in even more taxes. If I hear one more person tell me real estate is some sort of magical tax shelter for the wealthy I’m gonna lose my fucking mind... try it then, it’s a never ending nightmare!"
2021-04-22 21:07:26,wallstreetbets,"Maybe your unfamiliar with the concept of a deterrent I never at any point advocated for insurrection, sedition, secession or any sort of fight against the government. Sometimes it’s just important to remind people that it’s a government for the people and in this case the people are armed. If your anti gun or anti 2nd amendment that’s cool too not really the sub for those discussions, just don’t want for you to take a joke seriously about that kinda stuff"
2021-04-22 21:32:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that's what I've seen exclusively as well. WSB is a bunch of retailers gambling their life savings away. 100k is big gains here. 500k is insanity. You see a million in movement maybe once a week, if that. There's not many people moving millions here, so who tf is throwing a shitfit about these imaginary majority multimillionaires?"
2021-04-22 23:09:11,wallstreetbets,"You mean the one's that I said have the most to lose if something like this were to happen? *Those* middle class people? Cause...yeah. That's literally the problem.

Whether we like it or not, it's the wealthy whales who move the market the most. That's just a fact.. The more they buy, the higher stocks go. Just the same, the more they sell...well, you get it."
2021-04-23 03:42:04,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-23 03:28:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah at that point you'll probably be able to afford an accountant or financial advisor, someone who could handle most of this for you."
2021-04-22 21:09:15,wallstreetbets,"Well, there could be people that are simply tax gain harvesting now to take it all when they are in a lower tax bracket rather than risk a tax hike coming soon. I'd think selling off large amounts of stock and buying back in would be enough to trigger a few selloffs if they are a big enough fish.  They're still in the market, just have a hefty tax bill coming now, and can't buy back every stock they sold because of that."
2021-04-22 20:22:37,wallstreetbets,"Then people who make just over 2 million would scale back to get their gains under that threshold too. Any way you slice it, this disincentives success, and that affects the whole market."
2021-04-23 03:16:58,wallstreetbets,*marginal rate on $ over some threshold. Important to specify when this point comes up since apparently nobody understands how tax brackets actually work.
2021-04-22 22:31:59,wallstreetbets,"I don't know, perhaps by the fucking fact that almost every great invention in the past 100 hundred years has happened here?? Perhaps, i measure my the overwhelming amount of people that want to come here legally/illegally every year. Maybe, i measure by the fact that many, many americans can afford to own 2 homes, where the rest of the world can barely own one. I might also measure by the fact that, the entire world economy is based off of the dollar. Perhaps, it's the greatest country cause of people like my parents who came here in 1972 with 6th grade educations, worked, they shut the fuck up and didn't complain about anything, saved their money. Started a business, and now love a solid retired live of travel and leisure. There are only a few countries in earth that you can accomplish that. This my friend is the best of those. Until, you live a long life, have a couple of kids, raise them, then you know fuck all about life."

That's it. Until you have your own offspring, you will not understand life. I am going to try to make as much of an easy like for my kids asi can. The same way that every other person on earth tries to do. Which means, avoid fucking taxes, generate income, and make savvy investments."

2021-04-23 03:45:59,wallstreetbets,"I'm guessing what they meant is that when you trade one for another, you have to pay capital tax gain as if you converted the first to $ and then bought the 2nd."

With that I bought the call option I have today which is already 70% down from 10% over. I hope it gets a little better tomorrow and I can recover at least 50% of it..."
2021-04-22 20:07:55,wallstreetbets,Vox???😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2021-04-22 22:38:32,wallstreetbets,">What you think it is going to stop at $1 million?

The current bill and it's proposal? Yes. Engaging in hypothetical proposals is just deflecting from the actual proposal at hand. 

>taxing more to pay out more doesn't solve the actual issue. It just creates other industries dependent upon goverment funding to function.

The goal of taxing people making over a million annually isn't to give industries independence from government funding. It's to expand the collectives recourses from wealthier individuals to counter economic and social inequality. 

>Look at what happened to PR. Feds gave them money so Pharma companies would work there. Eventually the goverment pulled the funding and then pharma left resulting in the island getting fucked over.

Pharma went to Puerto Rico for tax breaks. The expiration of the tax breaks is what lead pharmaceutical to leave. They weren't **dependent** on government funding, they were taking advantage of not paying as much in taxes. It wasn't funding that fucked over the island, it was markets who's top priority is to maximize profits that fucked over the island. 

>This will be removed once the republican's get back in control so not only will the goverment funding be expanded but the means to fund it will be very quickly removed.

Very quickly removed huh? Lol. You sound very confident. I'm sure there's no way you could be wrong."
2021-04-22 21:40:44,wallstreetbets,I don’t enjoy giving anything to the government. I wait until the last day every year to file my taxes because I hate giving them my money. They can fuck off. I also have principles though. And one of those is that people shouldn’t be punished for being more successful than me.

2021-04-23 12:47:44,wallstreetbets,"For sure, the wealthy will still have plenty of tools at their disposal to minimize tax burden. These tax initiatives won't really close all of the loopholes that allow an ultra wealthy person to pay a lower percentage than an upper middle class family.

They also don't target large institutions which actually make up the bulk of daily stock moves although those institutions would be indirectly affected.

I optimistically think this millionaire cap gains tax shouldn't hurt the market too bad. But we are also possibly in a massive bubble so who knows."

You need to live in it 2 of the last 5 years to be exempt from cap gains.

Not that it matters. The wealthy aren't buying investment properties to turnaround and sell like a stock next year. They're renting them out, taking deductions, and watching their equity build.

Geez, this sub has gotten dumb."
2021-04-22 21:53:41,wallstreetbets,">  this disincentives success

What?

It incentivizes long term success, rather then entering and exiting  the market with 1m+ every year. If anything, this kinda fucks over shorts and a very small subsection of traders. **Investors** will be even more secure."
2021-04-22 20:29:13,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I’m misunderstanding your response, or maybe I didn’t phrase it clearly, or some other disconnect, but to rephrase:

With marginal tax rates, there is no scenario where an increase in your gross gains results in a decrease in your “take home” gains, so I don’t know why there would be an incentive to stay under any threshold. Now, you could argue there is diminished incentive to make gains beyond the threshold, but that’s very different from a disincentive."

Isn't the US one of the worse rich countries for poor families to stop being poor? I'm pretty sure I read some research on this a decade or two ago, and I was pretty shocked at the result.

Survival over all else, and of course that means that the human will do all it can to protect its own livelihood and its children/family. As I stated, it’s understandable people like yourself are too ignorant to understand that those are detrimental traits when you live in a civilization. Those were critically important evolutionarily speaking, but the best life you’ll have is living in a civilization, and guess what you give up living in that civilization that you currently do: innumerable freedoms. That’s the purpose of civilization. It’s to better everyone’s life, with the acceptance that in order to optimally achieve that, you must not cause great detriment to others. 

The more human beings that aren’t living in poverty, but instead have access to education, the faster humanity advances, and the better the technology you get to utilize in your life."
2021-04-23 13:43:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it's very important because it's how high income earners avoid taxes and more people need to do it if you want to grow wealth. LLCs allow you to avoid most common taxes and write off a large array of expenses, you just have to make sure you show some profit first 3 out if 5 years or it is considered a hobby. Even if it doesn't make sense to switch your main job to corp-to-corp because you've got crazy benefits, sick time, 401k match etc. (you also shouldn't do 1099s, straight payments directly to the LLC only), any side investment or income vehicle goes through the LLC. You pay yourself a ""reasonable"" salary, which is taxed slightly higher than an employee, but then the rest as a 20% distribution. This starts making sense to do of your total income is about 80k or higher, depending on your state. Definitely talk w a tax person if you pursue it, and never ever let your tax person do any money management or LLC management for you, if they offer and they aren't a HUGE worldwide tax firm then it's a red flag."

>Pharma went to Puerto Rico for tax breaks. The expiration of the tax breaks is what lead pharmaceutical to leave. They weren't dependent on government funding, they were taking advantage of not paying as much in taxes. It wasn't funding that fucked over the island, it was markets who's top priority is to maximize profits that fucked over the islan


Soooo.... their reason for moving there was dependent upon the government giving them money and once that ended they moved back were it made the most logical place for them to do business.....

the island couldn't attract the business on their own and no one was willing to build it on an island because it didn't cost flow..... the island fucked it self over. 


I would say the DNC losing the house, senate and the presidency again is very likely. Same shit different decade. They lost it all in the 2010s. It is the reason the crap tax cuts were able to pass 4 years ago when the dems lost all of congress and the presidency.... again not even a full 4 years ago..... they passed it in December of 2017.

no you would probably rather have the 4.6k, whether you invested that in 30 shares or something else you probably wouldn't buy the 0DTE calls for 160 tomorrow.

2021-04-23 03:47:35,wallstreetbets,Its irrelevant. Anything in the millions is ludicrous even if the squeeze hasnt sqoze theory is correct.

2021-04-22 20:02:51,wallstreetbets,"> over time the greeks will drive the price

Nope.  The greeks are a model for how we predict the contract price will change (over time, as underlying price changes, etc.).  And, they're often very good models.  But they never drive the price.  The only thing that ever truly drives the price is what people are willing to pay for the contract.  That's it.  Of course, people can make very good estimates of what a ""fair"" price for a contract would be, based on the greeks, and that's typically what's done.  But it is not really true to say that the greeks drive the price.

I think you and I probably agree but have different opinions on the semantics."
2021-04-22 20:49:43,wallstreetbets,"> the greeks will drive the price

The feckin Greeks? Or is it the Chinese we're after?"
2021-04-23 12:33:27,wallstreetbets,There are no 10-500 baggers on 800C GME when it was riding at 400% IV and \~200 price. You'd be lucky to make a 2-3 bagger dropping $10k on a single contract that has next to no chance of hitting ITM.

2021-04-22 20:09:42,wallstreetbets,"Ok but if algo's are model driven and they do most of the trading volume, don't they have a huge influence on price?

If for example there is a huge discrepancy between two options at the same strike say one 1 year from now and 1 year month from now, an algo would come and try to create a statistical arb play.  Same goes for two deep OTM options at the same expiry, if there is a discrepancy or prices don't react quickly enough to changes in the intrinsic value etc.

I think we do agree though it is semantics at the end of the day.  Whatever the market price pays IS how it is priced."
2021-04-22 21:06:54,wallstreetbets,Like how in hell are they coming up with ‘fair’ prices for COIN options? 🤣😂
2021-04-23 11:11:42,wallstreetbets,"Bruh. I made money on GME because I got in *before* it was 5x fair market value, and because WSB wasn't flooded with 'DD' that boiled down to a conspiracy theory my uncle would come up with. I was wrong about DFV selling, but if you need a public cheerleader for your stock you should follow a sports team, not investing.

2021-04-22 21:00:09,wallstreetbets,"Effectively, it is model driven and largely based on greeks/iv. Market makers set bid/ask using their proprietary model/algo. You as an individual can come in with a better bid/ask. If there’s no other individual interest, it’s the market maker filling you. The market maker relies on the model to determine if they want to fill you or not. If the model says no, you’re not going to get filled. So yeah, price is driven by what the model/algo is willing to pay/receive for contract.  


Put another way, you are willing to pay $5, but the algo thinks it is worth $10. You are not driving the price."

4. [$DGX Quest Diagnostics IV - Earnings Extravaganza](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mudfuw/dgx_quest_diagnostics_iv_earnings_extravaganza/)

**The Good:** 

* Overall Q1 performance 
* Strong recovery in base testing (core business) 
* Improved 2021 guidance for both Revenue and EPS 
* **MASSIVE $1.5 billion ASR to be executed in the ""coming days"". This is HUGE.** 
   * ASRs vary from traditional share repurchases in that ASRs occur almost instantly, while standard repurchases are more gradual 
   * This is in addition to 3.4 million shares that were already repurchased in March. 
   * Their float should be around 128m now. 90%ish of which is institutionally owned. **The ASR will reduce float by another est 11 MILLION shares, or almost 9%.** 
   * The high institutional ownership, as I've noted a dozen times over the past month, makes these massive repurchasing efforts even more impactful since institutional owners, the largest of which is Vanguard, will mostly continue to hold this strong dividend stock. 
      * \^ yes, I am aware of the run on sentence but asphyxia is setting in from the 14 masks I'm wearing 

**The BS:** 

* The earnings call in conjunction will the pre-call press releases were a confusing mess. The majority of the execs on this call may actually be autistic. Which is just another reason to lend them your support. 
   * Most egregiously, COVID testing is literally displayed on their own f'n website as roughly 10.4 million during Q1. Yet they somehow actually reported 9.4 million this morning.
      * This is a big no-no as a publicly traded company 
      * It is also the sole reason my personal forecast of EPS above 4 was incorrect 

**My Outlook: BULLISH** 

* I remain incredibly bullish on this stock. Positions are outlined in previous DDs. 
* Still a relatively safe double up+ opportunity at current levels 
* Also a great dividend stock to own outright

All in all it was a great earnings call though because, as I've said all along, there really wasn't any risk on this trade aside from an overall market downturn. Their base business is recovering and they are flush with $$$. I remain confident the big boys intentionally kept this stock down and continued to accumulate shares little by little as they chased retail out. Heck, another perfect example of this can be seen TODAY. Check the chart. Quick open to 132, then gets buried to sub 129 for 30+ min. Then rockets up past 132. I added to my positions when it fell because it was obviously BS. **Almost mathematically impossible for this stock to trade sub 130 in the long run after the $1.5 billion ASR.** 

**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else. Long live GME. **There should be an ""Earnings"" flair.**"
2021-04-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Telos (TLS) DD  **Trash my DD:** This is my first DD, so by all means trash it, give me pointers, degrade me, etc I'm here to learn! I've seen a couple people a few months back lightly cover this company but without details. So, here's my take.

&#x200B;

***TELOS***

&#x200B;

**What is it?** An I.T. and cyber-security company that serves govt and large enterprise clients and focuses on leveraging cloud technology.

End of 2020, going into ‘21, Telos switched their focus to product development, scaling, and deliveries. They didn’t have any strong advertising or marketing strategies ending 2020, though they plan to drastically change that this year with a planned *300%* increase on revenue from their 2020 advertising/marketing investments.

Their biggest product, Xacta, is used by BIG names: ***CIA, DoD, National Archives, Department of Energy, Amazon, and Microsoft.***

Telos has been flying under the radar for the past few years, being used only by people like the CIA, because they’ve wanted to focus on a niche customer-base and provide quality service, building up their business through hard work and a loyal, federal customer base rather than hype-- another reason you won’t find out too much information on them through typical analyst ratings: they’ve had a completely different customer-niche than usual companies. As they begin to spread into commercial organizations, more data will be released for the public to analyze.

Now, as cyber-security becomes increasingly important, institutions are setting standards that security and I.T. companies have to comply with. These organizations outside of federal agencies are constantly seeking help to comply with these new sets of standards which Telos has mastered with their cybersecurity product, Xacta. Telos is the only player in the game with a product like Xacta. All eyes are turning to them for help with complying to these new standards. Roughly 50% of commercial organizations are set to adopt these standards this year, with Telos’ product Xacta. Commercial companies/organizations everywhere are starting to do their research on who can help operationalize these standards and soon beginning to find out that Telos is the top dog in the game for it.   

The next venture of domination for Telos seems to be the educational sector. Unleash: ***Telos Ghost***. The Ghost product actually aims to completely hide the school’s network and cyber infrastructure from any outside or even internal threats as well as simply unauthorized users. Another goal of Ghost will be to completely prevent cyber bullying and hide the students and their assets, digitally speaking (very interested to see how the prevention of cyber bullying will be implemented into the security framework). Not only will Telos conceal the students and the school’s digital infrastructure with Ghost, working with Telos helps with school audits, making the exhaustive process smoother and within compliance with security standards. As we mentioned before not many products, dareisay…. Any at all… offer full security to organizations within the new set of security standards. Another factor that Telos has is the wifi networks they offer to educational institutions. It offers massive collaborative capabilities to the students and teachers, helping everyone achieve their goals together on the go with peace of mind of any security breaches on mobile networks. 

Looking at Telos as a stock, as of 4/19/21, institutional ownership has risen .1% to 27.6% and insider ownership has risen *16.3%* to 26.6%. They’re closest competitor is CSP Inc. which ended last year on a negative 1.45 million in net revenue, whereas Telos has actually ended 2020 with a net gain of 6.84 million. They only plan to increase their net revenue this year with the marketing and advertising investments they’ve made. The net gain of 6.84 million is up from last year’s negative 2.3 million and up from prior years as a whole, showing healthy signs of growth. Their revenue growth has gone up 20 million consecutively each year the past two years. Towards the end of 2020, Telos also signed a 10 year, 10 Billion dollar plan with TSA and their pre-check system. Coming into 2021, they’ve even managed to go ahead and set up $75 million in deals with customers *so far*. They still have plenty of time to add a couple more deals in. Their revenue for the end of the year is projected to be between 283 million and 295 million, which is over a 50% increase in revenue compared to last fiscal year.  Their earnings are projected to grow over 60% this year-- that’s faster and higher than the u.s. stock market as a whole year to year. The return on equity for the next 3 years is predicted to be almost 30% (29.3%). Telos also has NO debt. The company actually just completed a “Follow-On Offering,” which is a great thing for Telos because all they were doing was simply raising capital shortly after having their IPO-- a completely healthy move, in fact, a very bullish sign (remember, they have no debt, so all it did was give them more money to work with for future projects).


Edit1— positions: 7 shares @ 33.33/share (I plan on amassing more ASAP)

Edit2— this is not financial advice, I just like the stock and feeling more passionate about them the more I find

Edit3— my karma is too low atm to reply back to most people’s I was a lurker for a lil while however I plan on changing that

Edit4— I mentioned a 10 year, $10B plan (I read it wrong, just a multi billion, not a full $10B, thank you to the user that pointed that out to me!)"

More than anything this stock has been manipulated and lied about in the last 3-4 months with the price dropping as a result. It looks to be getting shorted heavier over this time. Most weak investors, onboard because of YouTube, have sold, and the yahoo forum on TTCF is full of long term investors proudly holding overpriced shares. It’s got a hint of GME to it - apart from its genuinely a great company which will pay out in the long run! I’m no expert and that’s just my opinion though"

2021-04-22 23:43:00,wallstreetbets,"Decent products and management, bad branding. Their commercial was really bad too. Just like other hipster stuff this will be hip for a while, before it fizzles out. I never short stocks, but I understand why people would short this one.

They should have gone the other route to brand it as something long lasting instead of hip. From what I can see they have interesting products. To be honest most vegetarians(being one myself) don't like premade vegetarian food. It's really hard to make something good. And I prefer to cook myself or eat at a good veggie restaurant. So if someone manages to come up with a good product its always interesting. However branding doesn't seem serious to me, If I find a good product I would want it to be there in 10 years also."

And the fact we no longer actually have a choice in what they do, means we need to flush them all out and start over, but that's obviously not happening anytime in the near future.

So the way I see it,  if you can't beat em, bet on em."
2021-04-22 23:16:29,wallstreetbets,TTCF actually does private label as well. So some of the “store brand” veggie bowls are actually TTCF product with the generic label.
2021-04-23 00:02:44,wallstreetbets,I owned the SPAC and when they announced they were merging with The Tattooed Chef the first thing I did was Google their product line. Wasn't impressed and sold.
2021-04-23 16:57:07,wallstreetbets,"That's all subjective. I worked in foodservice as a waiter in high end restaurants around Chicago, 99% of all the chefs, especially in the Michelin stared restaurants all have an excessive amount of tattoos, so for me this branding is true to the culture."
2021-04-23 06:38:39,wallstreetbets,"ngl, when i first heard the name i was like wtf? so i hear you.

but the numbers show that the brand is well received so far, and that's without them spending any marketing dollars. [this is a picture from their 8K SEC filing.](https://imgur.com/XAxLIiJ)

you can see that since they launched the brand Tattooed Chef in 2017, revenue growth has been going exponential.

i don't know why. but even if i don't get it or don't identify with it, i will invest if it works. i defer to it being a matter of time before the brand gathers its target, large audience.

one thing i feel more confident about though after reading all these comments is, i bet the audience of r/wsb is definitely not the majority audience of tattooed chef products :P"
2021-04-23 03:01:20,wallstreetbets,"yo the no debt is because of the CEO selling shares to pay it off right?

because i believe on some copy of their balance sheet that recorded the end of 2020 there was like $2m debt or something. and then i think the selling of shares, as noted in the SEC document, was to pay that off."
2021-04-23 04:33:40,wallstreetbets,"Me too. I dgaf about the label or if it’s aimed at hipsters. It’s in a market that’s growing, posting strong numbers, is virtually integrated and is constantly sold out.

2021-04-23 05:26:31,wallstreetbets,"i'm on board with the sense that the stock is misunderstood. i spent hours DDing this, and honestly it's one of the more difficult companies to wrap my head around. i think this is due to both its comprehensive history and lack of information. the highest quality of information is still buried in a 1 hour youtube video with the CEO. very few people watch 1 hour youtube videos :P

so once there are more informative pieces written out on the internet about this, the story will become more clear. i think the 2021 Q1 earnings report will kick that off."

2021-04-23 05:24:44,wallstreetbets,"if imma be honest, the social presence on TTCF is pretty damn low. i'm a social trader and so i've noticed that stocks with more social presence tend to have stronger swings.

tsla is for sure like, one of the best social stock ever.

if you search $TTCF on twitter, there aren't that many hits from high quality accounts. i think that's where the first problem is for the fanbase.

but on twitter, there's the dude who founded GymShark that bought \~$4.3m worth of TTCF shares LOL: [https://twitter.com/LewisMorganUK/status/1384942197729107968](https://twitter.com/LewisMorganUK/status/1384942197729107968)

Do you know what I mean? They're trying too hard to be the cool kids or whatever by fitting in to a somewhat underground culture and it comes off as forced to me."
2021-04-23 07:32:12,wallstreetbets,"I think we're on the same page here. I'm long shares.  

Thing is,  the management team seems like they really know what they're doing.  Their current product offerings and their pipeline projects really show creative innovation and prescience IMO. 

So why would they go with such fucking retarded branding?? Is it supposed to be a funny/ironic joke?? If so, I think a lot of people don't get it.

2021-04-23 19:10:57,wallstreetbets,"Oooh good question. Here’s one thing I’ve noticed from working in grocery: Amy’s is visually stale. 

They’ve maintained the same packaging and (largely) the same variety for over 15 years now. That will attract some devotees, sure. But the longer a product sits, the easier it is for people to just walk past it. And I’ve never seen an Amy’s product sell like I’m seeing the Tattooed products sell. 

Even if Amy’s were better (IMO it isn’t and their packaging/distribution method leads to more water inside the package that waters down the food) it doesn’t matter. Grocery isn’t about what the best item is. It’s about what sells. There’s artisan ketchup that’s 10x better than Heinz, waffles better than Eggo, and butter better than Land O Lakes. No one gives a crap. They buy the brand that gains a following and to do that it needs to blow out like we’re seeing at target right now."

Afterward, look in this thread for male redditors making seemingly-random, almost Tourette-like declarations that they eat meat, especially red meat (the comments never declare they're going to eat swordfish or even chicken; it's always red meat). They don't realize why they do it, but you'll come to notice it in every thread about anything mentioning plant-based eating or veganism."
2021-04-22 21:24:25,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, and thanks for starting a great conversation. We almost all have self-imposed dietary restrictions, but many aren't relevant to people's everyday lives, depending on where they live. For example, you might not eat cats or dogs, but you probably don't find yourself having to check labels for that. I'm very thankful I went vegan, though; I just wish I had done it sooner. The hardest part is just getting oneself to do it. It's all uphill from there in my experience.

I'm with you on sentiment about this company. I've had TTCF on my watchlist for a while now but never bought in because they sell animal products, so I don't want to support it but I also can't be bullish on companies that are wish-washy and misuse the term ""plant-based"". That to me screams: these people don't know what they're doing, not even in the most basic of terms.

Greenspace Brands is another wishwashy brand; it's a penny stock that's at rock bottom while the plant-based market has skyrocketed. The product I see most often are their GoVeggie cheeses. They sell vegan cheese and also mostly lactose-free dairy cheese in almost identical packaging. If you look up this brand on forums or on reddit, it's always ""WTF I bought this and it's not even vegan"". Creating a bad experience for customers trying to do the right thing is a fast way to get cancelled by a core customer base for a brand. That comes down to leadership not knowing their market because they're not a part of it. 

The founder and former CEO of Tofurky, Seth Tibbott, on the other hand, has been vegan since the 70s and his company is going strong to this day with popular, reasonably priced, tasty products that occupy a lot of shelf space in tens of thousands of stores and they have a loyal following. His idea of the original Tofurky has been copied by many other companies (Gardein, Field Roast) and even Trader Joe's does a private-label version every Thanksgiving, which sells out quickly. Tofurky is privately-held, though."

2021-04-23 09:18:05,wallstreetbets,Differentiation is hardly what marketers care about. It’s who gets picked off the shelf the first time. Most people are lazy. They buy something and if they like it they keep buying it. Brand loyalty or whatever you want to call it. Skippy and jif are the same damn thing but people swear by one or the other. Why? Bc it’s the one they buy.

2021-04-23 10:19:46,wallstreetbets,"Lol look at the ingredients. They’re the same. You kinda just proved my point. Almost zero chance in a blind taste test you correctly identify them with any statistical accuracy. There’s tons of research on this stuff. Like how the same ingredients can taste differently based on our visual cues of color or expectations of a flavor. It’s part of why being the first off the shelf is important for marketers. If the product meets the customer satisfaction, every new product now needs to go beyond that satisfaction point be it by price, taste, ease, or some combination of these and more. We are incredibly impressionable beings but have the sense that we are making wholeheartedly rational decisions"

2021-04-23 16:29:13,wallstreetbets,"Simple math here. 10mg more sodium is roughly 25mg of NaCl (salt). A teaspoon of salt is weighs roughly 2300mg. So 10mg of sodium is approximately 1/100 of a teaspoon of salt. Maybe a few granules (google says ~5 granules approximately) in two TABLESPOONS of peanut butter. 5 granules. I appreciate the effort you went through but there’s probably more than enough error from batch preparation and unequal mixing that could result in a larger difference. If you were somehow that sensitive to such a minute difference, might I suggest a career as a sommelier?"

I'm long on RIDE because when you look into the engineering the factors holding the stock down have zero correlation with the product.

All public data (including the Baja race) shows the product performing to specs so far. Obviously it's a risk like any EV startup, but there's some very interesting technical upsides.

Because it's oversold and artificially held down by financial analysts that have zero clue about automotive engineering - if they produce and sell it's going to pop off ridiculously fast.

(Electrical engineering background - my bull thesis is in the technical aspect of their design as it has major upsides in scalability, modularity, maintenance, and computer controlled power distribution as they keep developing.)"

2021-04-23 00:55:28,wallstreetbets,Yeah because she is worried about making someone money on reddit boards buying a few shares based on hype and hoping to make some stupid return in a few months. That is exactly who she is really doing her job for....

2021-04-23 07:17:18,wallstreetbets,"Your focusing so much on the cost of the gym but not the time sink. The commute is what kills especially for people no longer in college etc.. home gyms are much more convenient. You go into your garage and start working out.

Could you tell me who your broker is? Was it hard to be approved for option selling? I can sell puts with Merrill Lynch, but I need to provide 100% collateral in cash, e.g. $200 to sell a $2 option, because I'm only ""Level 3"". On that level I can't even buy a bear put spread, even though it doesn't really need collateral. Could anyone recommend a broker who is more likely to allow that?

Thanks in advance."

Except.... GME changed WSB. Now EVERY DAMN POST is a YOLO or Diamond Hands thing.

I wanna see the REAL loss porn and the REAL gain porn. Read a bit of fucked up DD. Maybe the masses will lose interest and I can go back to enjoying lurking and living vicariously through the autists"
2021-04-22 21:56:06,wallstreetbets,Basically what I've been telling all my friends to stay way form putting their money in this market for now. Regardless of what you believe in GME and how much it will be worth this short selling shit has definitely gotten out of hand. There's going to be some changes with how that's handled in the upcoming months. Hopefully it leads to a more open and fair market but we'll see.

Just call them and explain you don't intend to continue, supposedly they're pretty easygoing about lifting the first restriction for the asking, the second one is possible to get lifted but less likely, supposedly it's legal to give you a third pass in a year but they rarely do. But, yeah, keep your account over $25k in total value and you don't have to worry about it anyway."
2021-04-23 00:31:36,wallstreetbets,"Yea it's normal to keep short options open for long time periods, it's usually sorta the point of selling them"
2021-04-23 11:02:24,wallstreetbets,No hassles from Schwab getting approved for me. I'm approved for options level 2 but I don't do much (if any) over level 1 stuff.
2021-04-22 20:25:40,wallstreetbets,"There are subs dedicated to options, start there or YouTube."

2021-04-22 22:40:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah idk. There is fuckery about, because I've been watching the charts and they keep shorting it to keep certain options from hitting. I don't trust any data, but even if short interest is low, that is shady as well, because it sounds like they are getting a sweetheart deal, but idk. Gamestop has closed on an even number (as in divisible by 5 or 10) like 20 or 30 times since January. I know that's all just conspiracy shit, but also it's obviously manipulated. That's not a normal stock. It got back up to $380 and they fucked it up so the $400 options wouldn't hit. That's what tells me it's all a farce."

- Became the hottest gay bar in Philly

2: have no clue how to trade
3: almost never understand what an option is or how to use them
4: emotional idiots
5: almost always owned fractional shares
6: convinced themselves through conspiracy theories that they were going to be rich

It was one of the most cringeworthy and sad things I'd ever seen in my life. Lots of people lost a lot of money following those idiots advice, while the smart people sold because they bought when the price was <$20"
2021-04-22 22:04:10,wallstreetbets,"You can sell puts with YOUR margin. As in you can borrow cash against shares used as collateral for the loan, up to the normally allowable amount for initially buying those shares with margin. Which can then be used to ""cover"" puts, as long as your physical cash + borrowed cash is 100% of the assignment cost. Selling options with than 100% margin just means your account is large enough that you don't have to immediately put up all of the cash or shares to cover them, and the risk to the broker from that position blowing up is minimal"

It doesn't really seem fair to want the old bar stay in holiday-mode when a new bar dedicated to the new stuff has already opened next door."
2021-04-23 02:29:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the IV is not what it used to be.

I sold a 780c for 7.5K during the second squeeze. Would have made out with 80K if it got that high. Figured it wouldn't but was hoping the volatility would continue long enough for me to sell a few more of those.

Should have sold the 500c, I guess, or just cashed out at 340 and rebought.

Ah well, 250 @ $50 and getting cheaper each week."
2021-04-23 09:23:40,wallstreetbets,"ok now I am really confused, because your table shows multiple trades per day, but you say you hold for a really long time and now are talking like you hold trades for a week..."

2021-04-23 02:23:33,wallstreetbets,"Getting technical.

I think what he's saying is there is a max loss, he has more than enough buying power, and he likes the stock.

In short, he doesn't belong here.

In his mind he has already purchased the stock. Hence the ""good way to use margin without paying interest."" I salute him because he's got more wrinkles than I do. I thought I was just getting paid for my limit orders 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️"
2021-04-23 09:26:10,wallstreetbets,During this period I've had anywhere from 2 to 5 contracts running at a time for different dates.  But pretty much all of them are held for at least a few days.

That's exactly how I found you no-lifer :D:D:D:D

Also: I am still up on GME so you a fool twice"
2021-04-23 07:17:48,wallstreetbets,"That's actually pretty funny. Especially considering I only commented in one GME post yesterday.

""Every single GME post"" 🤡

This is the closest to a diamond in the rough that I have come across in years I truly believe there is nowhere for this one to go but up. I don’t think this is a sudden rise case though just a really solid long term play right here.
2021-04-23 11:47:34,wallstreetbets,"I watched it drop from $14 to $7 a share over months. Recently have seen the sell wall overwhelmed as good news about the stock shows up. I was kind of encouraged by this and went in for 25K as I knew the fundamentals, and was kinda watching it. Not sure the downward movement was not a hedge trying to get cheap stock.

So now that I am in the ranks of having a position of course I want it to go up.  Just thought I would throw in that disclaimer."
2021-04-23 12:20:58,wallstreetbets,SRNE good choice investors place power portfolio had it as a buy for under 8$ (around that price) its back at it again. SRNE has many potential catalysts this year which can send the stock way into double digits. holding 1k shares

2021-04-23 02:29:08,wallstreetbets,"My guy, you could have put 15k into buying 100 shares of GME instead of putting it all on options. Instead of buying calls you could have been selling them and collecting the premium and buying more shares if you truly believed in the company. Smh good luck man"

2021-04-23 06:36:21,wallstreetbets,I’d rather not just write a blank check to theta gang. Low premiums = more contracts. Eventually it’ll hit and it allows me to preserve capital and not tie up enormous amounts on longer dated calls.

2021-04-22 22:12:22,wallstreetbets,"You should be. In January 22, I was down about $12k on some GME weeklies. When the market opened, the 50 and 55c contracts were worth $0.23 and $0.15, respectively. I thought about selling them for a 92% loss, especially after I took a $6k hit on my GME 40c expiring worthless the previous Friday. 

I ended up holding, and walking away with 100k that Friday, on January 22. I reinvested some of that money in more GME shares and calls the following Monday. The rest is history.

Anything can happen."

2021-04-23 08:17:46,wallstreetbets,"good point. share the same view. that's why i believe a) VIAC has a competitive advantage over NFLX, Dis+ and Prime Video because of their existing cable TV users. NFLX still has less than 10% of total TV viewership in US. users switching from linear TV to streaming still want to watch things like sports, news, TV series. NFLX, Dis+, Prime Vid of course produce their own content (high quality too), but dont own the majority of viewership. imo there won't be 1,2 or 3 players - the market is big enough for a wide range of players. what i do see are more mergers and combinations coming up. typical for relatively new markets (streaming), first strong diversification (lots of new companies), then margins shrink and to keep a competitive edge companies start to merge to increase cost efficiencies and deliver better products cheaper. and that's my point b). VIAC trading at 25bn, while NFLX spends 17bn on content per year, makes VIAC a pretty attractive acquisition target at this price level."
2021-04-22 22:07:11,wallstreetbets,"OptionTiming is big on BB for the next catalyst that he is calling will happen soon triggering a market crash. This is one of his 10 tickers. He march crash 2 months in advance and advised to buy NVAX, MRNA, ZM, Shop in late 2020 march after the crash. For the next catalyst he says BB is the NVAX. I bought my self Jan 2022 and Jn 2023 $15 and $20 calls. If i see any sign of this catalyst that he is predicting, then I will load up on BB during the dip. Calls to hold until Jan 2023 are more value at the current premium than buying the stock outright even though it is trading in single digits. I did the same thing NVAX and exercised half the contracts and sold half the contracts in August when it $150...my calls were $20 and $15 Jan 2021 for almost the same premium as what bb is going. Once you exercise the contract and get the stocks, it doesn't matter which way it moves if you write smart stock backed options. Premium is crap now but if it goes off like expected, this stock will make you lot in option premiums."

2021-04-22 23:31:38,wallstreetbets,The patents didn't play a large part in my research they could be worth billions or little until the sale is finilaised. The bigger companies can stay in litigation for decades longer if they want which means the share price could see no material movement if only relying on the pAtEnT sale. This also gives them a lot of leverage during negotiations. But I can see how the patent deal would excite a lot of inexperienced people in the scene.

2021-04-23 01:24:56,wallstreetbets,Did you cash these out or still holding? Good luck bro
2021-04-23 06:15:26,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-04-23 00:08:01,wallstreetbets,So you're telling me GoPro still exists
2021-04-23 02:20:09,wallstreetbets,What's your positions??
2021-04-23 12:31:39,wallstreetbets,The DD is shallow. Fair value today is 20$/share.
2021-04-22 20:36:42,wallstreetbets,"I just bought a max this week because of a couple reasons. The price was $400 with a free 1 year subscription and memory card, and because of the crazy image stabilization. I go on a decent amount of hikes and rides on my onewheel, and not having to frame anything while still getting amazingly stable shots is too good for me.   
I can't say anything for their stock price, but I've never actually been disappointed with any of their products and have gotten my money's worth.

On the flip side, screw their accessory prices, china makes the same ones for pocket change."
2021-04-22 20:47:12,wallstreetbets,"As an everyday user, sure. For professionals, there's a lot of improvements that can still be made. For instance, most cameras have recording limits of about 30 minutes for 4K (GoPro is great when it comes to recording limits, they just keep going until the battery dies). Once those 30 minutes are reached, usually the recording shuts off because the camera needs to cool off.   


4K is also important to use even if you upload in 1080p. If you record in 4K, you can crop in for cinematic reasons, formatting reasons, or even just to get a tighter shot while still retaining a minimum of 1080p. If you record in 1080p, and crops you make will lower the resolution below that. 

I'm a photographer, not a videographer, but I can go on and give you lists of improvements that can and should still be made. They definitely aren't better than ""Anyone"" needs them to be. They are better than the average everyday home-movie maker/vlogger needs them to be."
2021-04-22 20:40:05,wallstreetbets,"As someone who's purchased a couple of those sub-$100 action cams, they aren't the same. The image quality is absolutely horrible. I used to do unboxing reviews of them, and not once did any of them look any better than my 2016 cell phone's camera. They may record 4k, but the bitrate is so bad and the lack of options make them unusable for anything close to professional. Also the sound quality is non-existent."
2021-04-23 14:16:53,wallstreetbets,Sure.   But the number of people needing that level of capability is miniscule compared to the mass market that makes you billions.   Capitalist corporations don't make their money catering to the tails.
2021-04-23 15:15:28,wallstreetbets,"maybe depends on the use,  for me it was for underwater while spearfishing so i cared about fps and honestly the viz is lakes sucks so you cant see further than 5 maybe 10 ft on a good day so, to film that its fine."
2021-04-23 09:49:32,wallstreetbets,I’m in 1100 shares
2021-04-23 09:21:45,wallstreetbets,"Got 9000 at $7.70 and 5000 at $8.58. Clover is a solid company, just now enough market share yet, but a way more advanced process and tech- wise comparing to UHGs and Humanas of the world. Go Clover!"
2021-04-23 14:22:20,wallstreetbets,Curious what the short interest will be once updated data is released Monday.
2021-04-23 18:36:56,wallstreetbets,"93 $9 5/21 calls here...down about 50%. I’ve been in and out of Clov before the reverse merger. Clov is backed by Alphabet and has been before Chamath. The Hindenburg report is based on a loose assumptions and all things that are common when it comes to insurance companies...especially Medicaid companies. Sooner or later, Clov will breakout and get the proper valuation. We can speed up that process....if we all do our part"
2021-04-23 11:46:35,wallstreetbets,Not as much but doing my part - 600 @ $8.57
2021-04-23 08:46:10,wallstreetbets,"Out of curiosity, what is your strategy for the May calls? I’m an idiot and accidentally bought high (placed an order; thought I cancelled; apparently did not).  I averaged them down but still losing a decent chunk of change after yesterday’s drop."
2021-04-22 22:43:45,wallstreetbets,Honestly that long of a call is probably pretty good. I may pickup a couple myself.
2021-04-23 16:27:53,wallstreetbets,Nice 😎
2021-04-23 09:23:50,wallstreetbets,Nice entry’s on a solid value-growth play!
2021-04-23 16:26:28,wallstreetbets,"Not too concerned about the squeeze, I was interested in the fundamentals prior to this. Also, it will likely show lower short interest as I’m sure most or some covered as they seen it holding strong. And too add to that, the short interest rate they show seems to be including the top executives non-tradeable shares so it seems to be lower than it really should be."
2021-04-23 19:53:27,wallstreetbets,100% agreed
2021-04-23 11:48:12,wallstreetbets,We’re on the same journey brotha doesn’t matter how many shares 🚀🚀🚀

2021-04-23 14:57:18,wallstreetbets,"negative, i am balls deep in PLTR. Still doing very well since i bought calls at the 21.50 dip - but nothing compared to MVIS. Nice pick."
2021-04-23 15:03:29,wallstreetbets,I have PLTR as well. My plan is to hold for 2-ish years while selling far OTM cc's on upswings.
2021-04-22 23:00:23,wallstreetbets,"News of a buyout would put the price near the buyout price anyway, so yeah you could sell the news. It's probably the least relevant place you could use this adage I guess."
2021-04-23 14:04:59,wallstreetbets,How can you guess? Did they give some sort of indication? Lol
2021-04-22 22:34:31,wallstreetbets,I’m sorry I just assumed because you were funny you weren’t a girl! 😂
2021-04-22 22:42:03,wallstreetbets,Oh...well...that makes much more sense...I can pretend to be a he if that works better for you. It’s what my parents would have wanted 🤷🏼‍♀️

2021-04-23 09:36:09,wallstreetbets,"Let’s talk about the facts. The great news is on its way. The offers are on the table. The earnings report will be first positive ever. No insiders selling. You do the math. And if every short position gets covered 100%, the stock will be above $50-75 per share. MVIS Gang!

Honestly do the math yourself before you judge me, do your OWN DD. This company is fucking valuableable if, you can’t see it- go to an ophthalmologist. I’m not a financial advisor and I can’t support anyone if they go broke yoloing into this stock. I own 2,200 shares of this bad boy"

2021-04-23 11:31:44,wallstreetbets,"https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html

Use this to calculate the price. A 100% cash buyout price can be anywhere between $67-$150+ pps is what we’re holding for. But I will say Iv lost money holding options for a buyout. So take profits when you can. If news drops and pps shoots up, sell those calls. I made that mistake when the Hololens 2 news dropped"
2021-04-23 11:35:36,wallstreetbets,Hope we get an update today
2021-04-23 13:35:05,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I’ll check that out and appreciate the advice. I sold 1/3 of my contracts this afternoon for the amount i initially paid for all 3"
2021-04-23 01:57:44,wallstreetbets,I’m long MVIS but this is a bad comparison lol.  MVIS is not going to be anything close to apple.  And you still would have made a ton of money on apple before during and after the IPhone came out.  They were already a top notch company prior to the iPhone.  I don’t have the exact numbers but I think apple was at 80B in 2007 and profitable before the iPhone.
2021-04-23 18:25:08,wallstreetbets,You had a good day today huh?
2021-04-23 13:38:01,wallstreetbets,"That’s a good idea. Having a consolidation now. Maybe another push before close today. But look for potential news Monday and earnings call next Thursday. Two potential boomski days for your calls. But your exp date is far out so you can hold for a while

2021-04-22 23:44:21,wallstreetbets,"Remember, GME bottomed a whopping 9 months or so before the squeeze actually happened. I don't expect this to take nearly that long because there is no pandemic throwing a wrench in recovery and the business case is honestly better than GME's was last Spring (probably why it's less shorted).

But it could still take some time. That's why I said I might roll my May call back."

2021-04-23 11:54:45,wallstreetbets,Learn that GME thesis is not wrong. Seeing as you think it’s wrong confirms by bias that it’s right.
2021-04-23 12:02:03,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it's wrong in the long-term, which is why i still hold a solid position, but if you held your entire position through 1/28/21 when the math CLEARLY changed you're a moron.

2021-04-23 12:50:43,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the tip
2021-04-23 17:09:20,wallstreetbets,GME was fun while it lasted. Great short term play on the gamma squeeze but it has zero catalyst. MVIS has a shit ton of catalyst through the rest of the year. We cud literally gamma squeeze this until the company gets bought out. It has a strong base of OG’s and the tech is disruptive. THIS IS THE WAY!!
2021-04-23 07:50:58,wallstreetbets,you have to wait at that price. probably 2 year to break even. Good luck selling at a loss and making it back elsewhere. Safe play is to stick to your guns.
2021-04-23 09:47:28,wallstreetbets,"Safer play would be to sell at a loss, and dump it into MVIS, break even before I finish this bowl of cereal...."

2021-04-22 20:10:37,wallstreetbets,ha ha that is how I feel about NOK. I bought a little bit too high so my money sat there FOREVER. Finally just got out and took a small loss. It is painful
2021-04-22 20:01:10,wallstreetbets,Sometimes buying is the only way to stop the bleeding. Thankfully these past two days have been up on AYX and SKLZ and I'm getting close to green.
2021-04-22 20:00:05,wallstreetbets,"You know, that's not a bad idea. I usually do LIFO to take the gains but was reading an article about doing what you just suggested, and it made total sense. I really never sold in lots/batches, so that was somewhat unfamiliar to me.   
Just to confirm, you are suggesting selling FIFO, taking the loss on those batches and then not buying for 30 days to avoid the wash correct?"
2021-04-22 20:08:09,wallstreetbets,I am here to help
2021-04-22 21:57:15,wallstreetbets,"either lifo or fifo, depending on which works for your positions. i got stupid hammered by ayx and several similar ones. retard consolation that i now i have a veritable plethora of loss harvests. still better to make money and pay taxes if poss."
2021-04-22 20:07:55,wallstreetbets,"This is so hard to answer.... it really depends on the movement of a stock price. There are some very solid companies out there that will have a share price drop significantly on earnings or some kind of rumor. I really won't pick up any company that has a share price higher than it was before the pandemic crash - for example MGM is way higher than it was prior to the crash yet has had so many losses financially. That makes no sense (to me).   


I'm kind of hoping you did buy AYX two days ago because its been up nicely. I think it is a good company and historically held a very high share price."

2021-04-22 23:13:57,wallstreetbets,"I’m no expert it could play out in slightly different ways. Typically the acquiring company would announce over a weekend they’re buying mvis out. You don’t need to worry about them disappearing or anything with a buyout you’ll either get a day or 3 to exercise or sell. The BO will be way above 30. If the bo price per share is less than then strike then you’d be screwed. I’ve never exercised options only sold them, and typically I go for the leaps, the long range options that may be more expensive but usually worth it. I think you’ll be good on those calls probably some big news April 29 with earnings call and shareholder meeting may 26"

2021-04-23 09:12:03,wallstreetbets,"""Strategic alternatives"" (buyout/partnership) is where the company's focus remains according to the CEO. Could that change in the future? Yes. But for now we have to trust what the CEO is telling us is their main focus. 

The CEO also said LiDAR is at a point where consolidation will start happening. MVIS is in a perfect position right now to take advantage of this. He also said that we are only just starting to see the true value (share price) of the work they have been doing in the Augmented Reality and LiDAR verticals."

Home based delivery has found its mark and simple shit is in high demand. The surges have caused a lot of planning headaches. Like dudes coffee, I enjoy my A and W diet. Sometimes its 2 weeks before its back in stock....then the push comes and I TRY to be respectful and stick to my 4 6 packs, but I see those shitbags buying 20 and wonder when it will slow down

I dont think it will.

I think that in the past you had to have it on the road every day to fill demand. Now you just hike it 20% and ship once a week and let the consumers squabble over it. Settle? The 10 people who were there earlier settled and took your 2nd and 3rd choice. No, I think companies are altering their business model to create far easier to manage quarterly reports, with predictable profit margins, all thanks to a virus that kills 40% of the number of people killed in traffic accidents in 2018,while removing 67% of drivers from the road in 2020, and creating entire new ways to do your job at home

THEN the ""teams"" song and dance comes in to play. Sure the math is right, you drop down to .18, but you pull twice the mileage, so it SEEMS like .36, but it's not UNLESS you are a rock and roller. THEN you and your partner ...and let me tell you...its FAR WORSE than any roommate situation...are pulling 6000miles a week.

Then you realize you have no time for anything, 6 to 7 days a week, to make 1200.00 a week, eating pure crap, passing in bottles, in a can that smells like facts and fabreeze, LONGING TO SEE A WALMART so you can ""shop"" for shit food, trying not to kill yourself eating TA diner food every day, just to realize that being poor is more fulfilling than being a long haul monkey.

Its like baseball. 40,000 kids are playing senior year, only about 900 get drafted and only about 30 of those see the majors and then about 3 of those go on to be roster players, and only 1 in 12 end up with a career spanning more than 10 years. 400k+ distilled down to 1 guy who is good enough to last 10 to 20 years because of his skill.

In trucking, to make the cash advertised, you have to break your neck, eat like shit, toe the line with DOT, in order to have a driving record you can take to a niche logistics company like special event outfits that do concerts only, to make 1500+ time bonuses, to pull in 100k a year....or learn the game,save, buy a truck, learn the game, and it is just like high-school and popularity jockeying, to make 150 and up.

Most wash out.

Those that do not, end up diabetic or hyper tensive, but know the games like per diem, entertainment expense manipulation, etc, as well as have an actual accountant, to clear 200k a year.

Want to try something unique? Try it. Want to earn a living and be happy? Find something else because, like baseball, only a few can manage it.

2021-04-22 20:01:26,wallstreetbets,Still tingling??? Lol.
2021-04-23 10:09:20,wallstreetbets,"YES LOL. What are you going to do, ask me at every dip? Specially after giant market dips?

Then I'll answer after every rip."
2021-04-23 19:12:35,wallstreetbets,The problem is they locked people out of their accounts with no explanation. That's the only reason I even know about this. People I know had problems and concerns related to the lockout. They relayed it to me. They should give customers a statement at the time to avoid the confusion and concern they created.
2021-04-22 21:25:59,wallstreetbets,"Not sure where you got the cumulative return numbers. Just running quick calculations on your spreadsheet and assuming you bought one share of each buy recommendation to capture the 1-day increase you'd spend $103,239.55 and make $638.89 or .61% return. Position sizes matter when calculating real returns because losing 10% on a $1,000 ticker isn't the same as losing 10% on a $100 ticker."
2021-04-23 06:34:22,wallstreetbets,"I’m not a day trader, so it sounds like a trade might be to wait a day, short/buy puts on his recommendation, and close the position after about a month...???"
2021-04-23 13:08:30,wallstreetbets,"I did a sample calculation of OP's measurements---he takes the price at close the day Cramer makes the recommendation, then calculates the percent change to the price at close the following day. It's true that buying at open the following day yields a smaller percent increase."

2021-04-23 12:44:39,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for posting, a really interesting strategy, I'm sure it is better than trying to pick winning stocks.  I was reading your past posts and I have a question about box spreads. If your account drops below 100k during a market downturn, I assume you get downgraded to  Reg-T. Does that mean your MM suddenly would go up by the the value of the box spread potentially causing a margin call/liquidation? if so, how do you mitigate that?"
2021-04-23 12:49:04,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you get downgraded from PM. They just stop margin-increasing trades and hit you with surcharges. If you're close to the $100K barrier, I suppose it's worth asking them about it to confirm."
2021-04-23 13:10:57,wallstreetbets,"you're right, found the following with a quick google search "" It should be noted that if your account drops below USD 100,000 you will be restricted from doing any margin-increasing trades. "" also apparently now you need $110k to apply for PM."
2021-04-23 14:55:42,wallstreetbets,"I have another question for you, google wasn't much help here, in the link you provided about selling box spreads, one of the cons listed is "" Portfolio margin traders can suffer margin calls if you have a bad  mark/quote. This is a huge problem at Interactive Brokers. TD Ameritrade  seems to be a lot smarter about this. You need to place a GTC close  order at a very favorable unrealistic price to always quote your box."" if you are placing limit orders how is this possible?"
2021-04-23 15:04:31,wallstreetbets,"How is what possible? Getting a bad mark? Because that sentence suggests that, you’re right, if you have a GTC limit order, you won’t get a bad mark"
2021-04-23 15:19:35,wallstreetbets,"thanks, I'm new to box spreads so I'm being extra cautions, the irony that this is wsb doesn't escape me but i typically come here for the comedy. the reason your post caught my attention was because i remember reading something similar on bogleheads that made a lot of sense but I never got the time to try it out."
2021-04-23 16:28:01,wallstreetbets,"I mean, in many ways, I’ve just copied Steve Reading’s Lifecycle Investing portfolio from Bogleheads if you’re familiar. I’ve just cranked up the leverage for higher long term compound returns but even the same positions, I used what he recommended."
2021-04-23 18:29:22,wallstreetbets,"> Lifecycle Investing portfolio 

that's the one, I've also read the paper by Ayres and Nalebuff, planning to read their book too. this was a couple of months back and i'm trying to actually implement it this time around because i think the logic behind the strategy of taking more risk when you're young and less risk when old makes a lot of sense."

I learned more about the stonk market in the last few months than I’ve learned in my previous 60 years. You are a class act and an excellent teacher/instructor. You exude honesty and integrity.

2021-04-22 22:36:10,wallstreetbets,"#**The LarsTim Recovery GamePlan**

Here’s the idea. Let me know if it’s stupid and pointless. I don’t think it breaks any rules. It’s not an evasion of this site’s or subreddit’s rules, but is an attempt to get in contact with Tim through another website.

I’m going to post a message that essentially tells Tim, if he’s browsing this subreddit, to go and check the unpinned subreddit. We can’t do any direct links, because automod will gat them. Basically, we need people to also do this while I’m asleep from midnightish to 7:30AM ish- just make sure that there is a comment with clear instructions directing him to that subreddit, where there is a link that he can click to get in contact with us. Doesn’t have to be every hour or spammy, but just enough so that it’s not buried where he can’t see it. 

This way we can contact him without him risking a new account and a perma. I think it’s important that we do it while all of this is fresh in case he actually was perma’d. Because if he was IP perma’d, he’s probably going to stop posting altogether. But I’m sure his curiosity will lead to him checking at least one more time tomorrow. We just need to make sure the information that will get him in contact with us is there and available as well.

Any questions or suggestions to how we can do this better?"

I tell her that her body looks incredible and she thanks me, telling me that she's put a lot of effort into it. We go upstairs to work out. She takes a quick pre-workout video for her instagram and has me snap a couple of photos with her phone. She then proceeds to work out hard. Legs, arms, elliptical, bands, weights, she is a machine. She takes a couple of short breaks to update her fans on her workout and point out how sweaty she is. I, being a chivalrous guy, offer to let her use my shower. She gets back on the elliptical. I'm behind her doing bands. And then i see her on tinder swiping right and left. She is literally setting up dates with probably some AMC fanboy while at my house.

[DKNG 12 MONTH](https://imgur.com/a/bHNJVc9)

Few things here: Draft kings recently had a death cross, represented by the red star. 

It’s 12 month channel is showing that it managed to find support after bouncing off of upper channels resistance. Quickly lead to the death cross mentioned above on the 3 month. 3 month & 12 month show support for the current channel (bottom)

It’s in a accumulation zone. 

Bollinger is showing that it will be consolidating very soon, I would like to see it break above its MA resistance ( $60 ) but at the moment we’re seeing some consolidation beneath it in the  $55-$59 range. I’d buy anything close to $55. 

Anything below $50 is bearish & a break of the channel it’s been in for a while. I imagine the overall index movements of the markets will be very important here. Any bearish movement in indexes will bring us down market wide.

Thoughts?"

2021-04-23 14:02:14,wallstreetbets,"😂 fuccc dude thanks for the actual laugh. 😂

But i been there. I dated a high-maintenance model type, low key partially hoping my ex would get jealous. With my luck though the only time i ever ran into her was one night out drinking with all my gay friends 😂. Moral of the story chase your happiness, not someone elses misery. Its healthier if its what you want for you tho! No point wasting any more headspace on her. Thoughts get forgotten all the time."
2021-04-23 14:02:46,wallstreetbets,not sure if healthy but i could say it is valid at least
2021-04-23 17:09:26,wallstreetbets,Sometimes ya gotta be the bad boy

2021-04-22 23:45:45,wallstreetbets,"I know, right! A dog killed the last of our chickens a few weeks ago so the ticks are going to be a nightmare this year"

2021-04-23 15:38:24,wallstreetbets,"85% profit!  Sold my 2 calls, & bought a put to cover the one I sold.  Still have 100 shares I sold a covered call on 😀.  Kids ESA's each had 65 of MVIS, so they got a little bump too.  🦍🚀"
2021-04-23 10:35:22,wallstreetbets,$17s club says hi.

2021-04-23 12:51:19,wallstreetbets,$18.24 says hi. 🌝
2021-04-23 14:08:21,wallstreetbets,"You said bye already ? Now you’re back ? Lol I’m not your enemy , I like when people make money. It’s not like MVIS having an up day affects me negatively or positively it’s just a stock man, I’m not emotionally invested. How much money are ya up so far ? And how long are you planning on holding ?"
2021-04-23 14:52:00,wallstreetbets,"I bought at $18 originally in February, by pure luck at 4:05pm during AH there was positive PR and it soared to $24, sold for $1600 profit and re entered at $20. Averaged down to $17 when it was around $10s 🌝"
2021-04-23 14:54:53,wallstreetbets,"Oh cool so you’re long long, well that’s nice man sounds like it’s working out 🏋️‍♀️ good luck going forward"
