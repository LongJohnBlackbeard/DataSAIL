2021-06-24 18:58:06,stocks,"Lol nothing to do with earnings smash. It's going up because I sold all my Nike shares right before earnings, that's all."
2021-06-24 19:29:38,stocks,very expensive stock. Very strong brand but you can‚Äôt justify their valuation
2021-06-24 18:38:00,stocks,Love my Nike stock
2021-06-24 18:53:11,stocks,What a monster of a quarter Nike had. And y‚Äôall were panicking a couple months ago because a gymnast decided to leave Nike.
2021-06-24 18:50:26,stocks,"Give them stimmy checks and what do they spend it on?  Overpriced sneakers.

No... no, you do not need a special pair of athletic shoes for that new Peloton."
2021-06-24 19:45:23,stocks,I rather buy lulu next nike in the making with a premium in margins üëç
2021-06-24 19:00:20,stocks,Thank you for your sacrifice. Did you buy FedEx before earnings? Is that why the stock is dropping?
2021-06-24 19:00:55,stocks,This is why I never pull out
2021-06-24 19:15:13,stocks,"Earnings is always a coin toss. I believe Nike also beat earnings last quarter, but it went down afterward."
2021-06-24 19:54:20,stocks,Yea I don‚Äôt really understand their valuation even when you factor in their brand name but that‚Äôs just me.
2021-06-24 19:34:06,stocks,Tuff to justify many stocks valuations in this current market
2021-06-24 19:02:28,stocks,Haha I remember that... everyone goes to Nike to buy women‚Äôs gymnastics clothes üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2021-06-24 19:29:54,stocks,Racist who are they
2021-06-24 19:07:47,stocks,"Did not buy the stock, bought calls instead."
2021-06-24 19:18:25,stocks,Not true they missed revenue by 6 percent last earnings
2021-06-24 19:40:19,stocks,but Nike isn‚Äôt even a growth stock but trades like one
2021-06-24 19:40:23,stocks,I don't know why your laughing.  The company does alot of shitty things.
2021-06-24 19:24:13,stocks,"Yeah, revenue missed estimates last quarter, but the earnings beat."
2021-06-24 19:53:40,stocks,I agree.... got your eye on anything in the next few weeks?
2021-06-24 19:51:07,stocks,Who cares so do most company‚Äôs.... I‚Äôm trying to make money
2021-06-24 19:52:53,stocks,"Everyone here is buddy, it is what it is.  But there is no point in laughing at others who chose not to invest based on moral beliefs."
2021-06-24 19:54:29,stocks,What are your moral belief company‚Äôs?
2021-06-24 19:53:55,stocks,ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2021-06-24 19:55:55,stocks,Non I don't invest based on morals but don't laugh at thoughs who do.  Or laugh at abuse scandals.
2021-06-24 19:54:17,stocks,Good old teenage edge lol
2021-06-24 19:57:44,stocks,No one brought up morals until your comment
2021-06-24 18:42:51,stocks,What‚Äôs everyone‚Äòa consensus after the Earnings call? I was ehh about it tbh.
2021-06-24 19:47:38,stocks,"Eh, semi chub. Expected more from the call."
2021-06-24 19:02:23,stocks,It seems to me fairly boilerplate. They‚Äôre restructuring. Losing money but stopping the bleeding and looking to pivot into their core areas like cyber security. I‚Äôm optimistic for the future but think the actual value might take a while to build
2021-06-24 19:37:36,stocks,"My concerns at this point are that the management team has been saying the same exact thing for the last 3 quarters, and continues to kick the can down the road on the earnings calls. 

I'm also concerned that IVY is not going to be as immediately high-grossing and widespread as the investors have been led to believe. This, above all else, will be a major detriment to any short-to-medium-term price action."
2021-06-24 19:46:08,stocks,"They have been selling off assets to pay down debt and put capital towards priorities. They seem to be focusing and moving in the right direction. 


I agree that I‚Äôm not expecting short term or maybe even medium term price action. I think this is a fairly risky play offering a ground floor access to a company looking to reinvent and grow. But it is an attractive space and I think they can execute a nice turnaround"
2021-06-24 17:37:07,stocks,I made my wife open an investment account a couple months ago with money she had sitting in saving. She picked TGT and AMZN. And she‚Äôs happy! So I‚Äôm happy. I personally have no AMZN stock but I think you are right. The only concern I have with them is about regulations breaking them up in the future but I‚Äôm pretty sure Amzn will buy the politicians and will come out ahead. I wish it wasn‚Äôt the case but I see that as the only obstacle to more growth from them.

2021-06-24 19:56:08,stocks,Lol
2021-06-24 19:37:46,stocks,They mean the largest market cap.
2021-06-24 19:41:35,stocks,What are you talking about?
2021-06-24 19:57:39,stocks,"I know that. If Amazons earnings are 3x lower relative to their market cap compared to Apple‚Äòs, it‚Äòs hard to say they are undervalued"
2021-06-24 19:56:04,stocks,[deleted]
2021-06-24 19:51:53,stocks,"Yes, ABCL is going up 43.25% on Wednesday am, next week.  Tomorrow is an excellent time to buy but better to buy tonight."
2021-06-24 19:32:48,stocks,"Make sure you're looking into share dilution. CCL is trading at half it's pre-covid price, but there are twice as many shares outstanding, so it's really trading a the same value despite the price being half as much. I think there's some room to run once they start getting boats in the water, but not as much as it looks like.

u/bp___ is also very much correct about being late to the party on most of these plays. You'd have to find something that isn't an obvious reopening play to get big value at this point. For example, road traffic is going back up, are tire companies depressed or did they float up with everyone else when the market recovered from the crash?"
2021-06-24 19:45:45,stocks,"I played CNK starting in November. Entered at about 15. Exited about 22. Pre-Covid it was around 32, but with so much dilution it seems unlikely that it will return to those levels even by year end. Also cruise lines. There are some opportunities right now, like today 6/25/21. I am targeting 37 for my NCLH (entry at ~27) not sure where CCL will go, but most likely 33 as a max. Again it is about dilution and additional debt. CCL could go higher if they reinstate their dividend, but that doesn‚Äôt seem likely this year."
2021-06-24 18:47:02,stocks,I think you're too late. All these recovery plays have been priced in.
2021-06-24 18:51:38,stocks,"I disagree.  The exact point of the post was to find markets where its not too late.   sure its too late to make a play now in bio-research, big tech, but there are markets right now still heavily affected by the pandemic.  Tourism, Retail, etc.  TY for your effort though..."
2021-06-24 19:26:58,stocks,"The summary is so good . I will
Never miss it"
2021-06-24 19:16:17,stocks,"Thanks, as always."
2021-06-24 18:58:14,stocks,Thank you and hope your day is going good for you.
2021-06-24 19:17:34,stocks,Thank you for another daily recap. Some great calls by you lately üëç
2021-06-24 19:29:45,stocks,"Thank you, really appreciate you saying that, glad you found the recaps useful"
2021-06-24 19:30:32,stocks,"Same to you my friend, have an awesome day"
2021-06-24 19:30:18,stocks,My pleasure!! Thank you glad you have found the recap useful
2021-06-24 19:58:31,stocks,These are awesome. So appreciate what you guys have to say.
2021-06-24 17:10:24,stocks,"I think all of them will pullback within the next couple of weeks, doesn‚Äôt mean you should sell them because I could be wrong. NET and CRWD are two of my favorites for the next decade. The growth of the sectors and the companies (especially crowdstrike) is unreal."
2021-06-24 19:25:17,stocks,"since motley fool recommended NET today, that was my signal to start unloading 50% of my holdings. I'll keep the rest for now."
2021-06-24 19:14:51,stocks,I actually just sold some NET today to realize some profits. I love the company (and the stock) but it is trading at an absolute insane valuation. Moving my profits into QQQ and VOO and holding my remaining shares for a long long time
2021-06-24 18:42:06,stocks,Net is over extended. Sell now and buy back after 30 days to avoid wash sale
2021-06-24 19:43:05,stocks,Crowd is out of this world are they such a good company or what is happening there haha sadly i missed the boat üö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2021-06-24 19:18:41,stocks,"Yeah, I sold some as well. Probably have about 1/4 of my original position in case it pops to $110, but feel the same about the valuation"
2021-06-24 19:12:47,stocks,"A wash sale only applies to a stock you sell at a loss. OP is taking profits, so the rule doesn't apply here."
2021-06-24 18:48:13,stocks,"Really great company but is a bit high atm, sold a third of my holding."
2021-06-24 19:56:42,stocks,I bought the dip to 175 a couple months back and I'm super happy with it so far. What I like is that the company is proving to not only be the best in class end point security company but is willing to expand through acquisitions into new areas.

2021-06-24 16:48:32,stocks,"When done via an exchange, the buying and selling of options is pretty much identical to the buying and selling of stock. You may buy one stock for $1, but no one will care if you try to sell it for $100 unless the market has moved to point where it believes $100 is a price worth paying for it. In a very basic way, trading options works the same way."

2021-06-24 19:28:59,stocks,"The deal is not finalized. This bipartisan bill will pass in the Senate with Republican support - and then the Democrats will use the process of reconciliation to pass additional spending measures on TOP of the bill, which are likely to include additional dollars for EV infrastructure. 

The bipartisan agreement along with the additional reconciliation will then make its way to the House where it will be passed. 

Important to note - if the additional spending in the reconciliation is not passed, Speaker Pelosi said today that the House will **not** hold a vote on the bipartisan bill as a standalone."

Davis-Beacon wages will be applied on non Union infastructure work.  Resulting in higher wages for those parties and for unions.

If you invest in 10 companies - follow those 10 companies.  Then, from a macro standpoint, know when the Fed will talk.  Know when unemployment numbers come out.

If you only watch one thing and don't do any DD you're just as informed as everyone else watching. I play more into the FOMO than what's hot. For months I've been talking about Norwegian because it's going to go up and having it now means I won't miss out but I can sell when it goes up. I just did the same with GMTX because it'll rally quickly on any good news. Even this morning it showed signs. 


Really watching stuff can be good but people are also idiots. Bitcoin isn't going to reach $500,000 any time soon. Tesla is way over priced. GameStop is a joke. All of that is going to come to a head. Best thing to do is play the long game.

Longer answer: absolutely fucking not."
2021-06-24 12:25:17,stocks,"TLDR: you are giving advice she asked YOU for. You are good bro.

She asked for your advice. It is like giving any other advice. It is no different than asking someone about what car to buy and or recommending a car to buy when someone asks. Let her know you aren‚Äôt a financial advisor, these are stocks or an investment strategy that you think would fit what she is looking for. There is risk in investing in stock like any other investment but in your opinion is still a worthwhile investment. If she doesn‚Äôt want to do it, she doesn‚Äôt have to. Confirm that she is ok with it, and if so, carry on. She may/will have her reservations and ask questions but remember, she came to you first so speak honestly. It‚Äôs not like you are stating false claims about how you are the Stonk God, you can guarantee ludicrous returns, and WSB does your bidding. The presented strategy is basically a 401k except better (assuming less fees) lol.

With that said, emphasize the risks of it and this is for the long haul not for a quick buck.

Start small and safe, and build from it. 

MEME stocks 101 according to the curriculum is at 2nd year, not sure if it is 1st or 2nd semester.

With that said, I would not go as far as picking stocks for her. Just guide her, but it will always be her call on which to buy."
2021-06-24 13:47:54,stocks,"My advice is to not ""pick"" any stocks or funds for her. Just inform her to the best of your ability on what each of them do, what kind of growth or trouble they may have, and the dangers if she invests in them.

Picking them for her will quickly cause a problem when/if they lose money. If she makes an informed pick herself, she only has herself to blame. Its much easier to accept/get over a poor choice that we make on our own, than to accept a loss that someone else picked for you (imo).

The important part is that she has all the relevant info to make her own choices. In the end, its helping teach her how to pick her own in the future. You can stay on the sidelines and not get blamed for a loss or badgered to provide another ""win""."

If you don't help her to at least do this, then she might get info elsewhere and do something worse. Financial advisors are usually dumb af. Have her put her money into SPY or something extremely safe like that. It gets risky when you start advising her to buy specific companies. But if we can't advise people to start with something like SPY, then what the fuck are we doing here? If you want her to be even safer than that, have her download Acorns and dump it all in there. It's essentially just VOO and other ultra safe stuff. It's not IDEAL of course for an experienced investor but for a noobie, it's not a bad deal. Besides, the last thing we need is for her to start reading this sub or WSB and making terrible fucking trades.

SPY has decades of data showing it's fine. We can't predict if SPY is going to dump 50% a week after you tell her to buy it. But if that happens, then buy more. I think your idea of placing her on a weekly deposit into SPY is fine. Tell her to also read up on SPY and some very popular books on long term investing so she can be informed."
2021-06-24 13:08:28,stocks,"Not advising but if I were in this situation I would probably go 85% VT and 15% in stocks you guys have faith in. I think you're safe this way. If it were my GF, I would definitely set her up with a safer portfolio than mine and honestly with 85% VT you're going to outperform quite a few active investors (maybe yourself) and hopefully will get a bonus with your 15% stock picks. Even if your stock picks aren't doing that good at least you have that 85% backbone. You've got more than money at risk here lol.

2021-06-24 16:39:09,stocks,"My girlfriend comes from a culture where investing isnt seen as something for them, also looked at with distrust. It took months for me to get her to invest. She had thousands of dollars stashed away in a sock drawer like a drug dealer. It would have probably taken a much shorter amount of time had I not constantly been saying ""I am still learning myself, and I am fully ready to lose a fair amount of my investments if there's a crash. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose"" but it wouldn't be fair to her if I pushed her blindly into investing

Once she finally was ready to invest, I spent a lot of time teaching her how to invest, seeing sales where other people panic and sell, how to use some of the more basic metrics to see value/growth in a company, and also more abstract things like company direction/vision, leadership,, broader context when something happens in short term swings etc.

She actually wound up using all that to invest in PTON on her own. She saw a 15% drop in the stock in response to a recall of a product that makes up 3% of their sales, bought the dip, then continued to buy dips when it had red days. She's up like 20% now and it's the biggest position. 

Just be thorough with your girlfriend, you could just make her park money in an index fund blindly without learning but you risk her panicking and selling for a loss if you don't teach her fundamentals and Mr Market stuff."
2021-06-24 13:16:17,stocks,"I would start of with 90% in ETF‚Äôs and 10% stocks on about 10K of what she has. Now she can see how much risk she can manage mentally and if the stock 
market is something for her. Let her experience ups and downs. Then slowly add money DCA. 

For the 10% stocks she must choose something that she understands and where she feels good about. Does she uses Pinterest? Does she likes it? How does she see it in the future? Maybe she loves videogames? What is het favorite publisher? 

Then check the balance sheets on those stocks and see if there reasonable prized.

If she puts money in stuff she doesn‚Äôt understand, it‚Äôs more like gambling then investing. It will hurt more if it goes down. Her Conviction is key, not yours."

She opened an account, funded it and got the bonus. Then bought some NIO at the top yikes without my guidance. So I keep nudging and giving her tips but so far she just watches them and evaluates how she would have done. Figure in the end she will see. Maybe I could set her up a paper account and invest her money and show her what she is missing out on.

Yes it's her money. no we are not married or co-habiting. so it's none of my business and yes if she lost $ she would blame."
2021-06-24 15:15:23,stocks,Your idea of helping her set up a weekly index fund buy sounds like about the only safe thing for you to do.
2021-06-24 16:49:02,stocks,"The thread seems to cover enough about the actual stock advice, so I'll go for another point. 

I think it's important to inform people about not investing money they'll need in a near future, be it a month, a year, two years, and so on. Stocks don't always go up. If they invest too much and have no emergency fund, and a crash comes, they will most likely exit their positions at a big loss and will likely swear of the market for good.

With some kind of security net, assuming the stocks/indexes or whatever are solid, she can easily just ride it out and let it recover, and even DCA a bit. I find this is the part people have a hard time understanding. The market will likely recover and reach new heights, but we have no idea how long it could take, and if it doesn't... well, we'll probably live in a society where bartering is back on the menu anyway so.

So my advice before you give her stock advice is that you see over that she has a real safety net and this 30K isn't everything she's got to her name and make her understand the risk. Things happen and having to sell things at a loss blows, and that would definitely sour your relationship. Money affects people."

Initially, you'll advise her to buy SPY or some other ETF that the two of you have looked over together. You're doing this to get the money into the market immediately and so it can start working.

From that point on, the two of you will discuss the market together. You'll help her learn the basics, encourage her to go a little further with her questions through research, you'll give your opinion about what she's asking.

As the two of you are sharing knowledge about the market in general, and the current iterations, she can decide how she feels about her positions in the ETFs that she owns.

Does she want to stay with that, or are there things that she is now more interested in and comfortable with?

You've helped her build her initial portfolio, and the two of you have had numerous conversations, and maybe debates, about a subject that you are both interested in, which should be fun. And, the future direction of her portfolio will ultimately be hers.

If you can't talk to her about money now, you won't be able to talk to her about it further along in your relationship, so don't wimp out."

2021-06-24 12:25:54,stocks,"From my experience‚Ä¶ based off of the merger being a cash offer, the price of the shares you own will rise to the buyout share price, usually going a bit higher, once news is announced. It will then fall a little below BO price and then hover right around it until BO occurs. Selling off on that first initial run up will secure gains and close out position. Occasionally a bidding war breaks out and the share price goes higher but that‚Äôs a chance you have to decide whether it‚Äôs worth taking because the opposite to that, is the deal falls through and your investment gets crushed. Also there‚Äôs the possibility of a cash/stock buyout where you get some cash but also stock in the buying company (which you don‚Äôt want) so just have to sell off for profit. Usually once the dust settles. In the same way the company getting bought out gains share value, the buying company usually goes down in share value a little at first before bouncing.

When the program ends these folks aren't going to lose their homes.  And this housing market will be able to absorb whatever homes are foreclosed on (or those that are sold in lieu of foreclosure).  Foreclosure worries, IMO, are overblown."

2021-06-24 15:07:07,stocks,"A ton of Tesla bears simply don't understand the market. Other ICE auto companies are cannibalizing their own ICE sales trying to get EV's. That huge shift won't come without a cost. I think GM's Chevy Bolt was losing $4-8k per vehicle and the CEO came out years ago saying that they won't be profitable until early 2020's. I'm not sure if they are profitable now but I doubt it... CEO's tend to overstate the ability to generate a profit and GM is offering huge discounts on their Bolt's as we speak. Probably trying to get rid of them for the next model but that also speaks of the demand for their Bolt. Getting into EV's won't be as smooth of a transition for others. Haters will point to the regulation credits. The fact that regulation credit revenue continues growing as a source of revenue for Tesla shows that other ICE companies aren't taking the EV push or aren't as prepared as they should be which can only mean that Tesla still has a margin of safety in terms of an advantage.

Their Q1 sales is what? 50% growth yoy? The issue Tesla seems to have will be the supply chain and adoption of more charging. It's not feasible to own a Tesla in many parts of the world and I understand why some are likely very hesitant to switch because of that reason. I can't trust that there will be a supercharger when I'm traveling. Yes, I can install a charger at my home but it's not feasible for the masses to do so, e.g. living in an apartment or rental unit. Supply chain is a huge problem particularly because Tesla's growth depends on it. Not having the chips or a lagging battery production will be problematic but I'm very bullish on their new Berlin factory.

Right now, Tesla is doing fantastic despite having no federal tax credits. If politicians approve the federal tax credit at the range of $7,500 - 12,500, get ready for a mass adoption of new Tesla vehicles particularly if Tesla somehow manages to release their $25,000 'Model 2' edition in time. That vehicle would be a gamechanger. Personally, I'm not sure how to feel about the cybertruck and whether F-150 buyers would switch. I know the new electric F-150 will be more expensive and have a lower performance but I'm not familiar with how pickup truck buyers feel about the cybertruck.

All-in-all, you gotta be really foolish to think Tesla won't be dominant in the future. Everything is pointing towards it. Their margins on vehicle sold is over 25% so they can be more profitable in the future. Right now, I don't see any company having any plans to release a $25,000 sedan with the specs that Tesla will be able to push out within the next few years."

2021-06-24 17:11:40,stocks,"> Other ICE auto companies are cannibalizing their own ICE sales trying to get EV's. That huge shift won't come without a cost. 

I feel like this is something that the Tesla bears who are hyping up F & GM and other automakers just don't understand.

The other automakers won't become more profitable by switching entire lineup to EVs, which is why they've dragged their feet on it for so long. If anything the other automakers will become **LESS** profitable even if they sell the same number of EVs as they are ICE vehicles today,  simply because EV's require less maintenance then ICE vehicles, making them cheaper to own after the initial purchase. This is why dealerships (who make their money on maintenance) don't want to sell EVs either.

And that's not even mentioning other challenges they're likely to face to, including:

* A lot of them have unionized workers who aren't stupid. They know that EVs will require less workers (because there's less moving parts in them, and they're just simpler), which is going to cause issues between them and management.

* When EVs begin catch on with the public the re-sale value of ICE vehicles is going to drop. This will make new ICE vehicles less desirable since people will know that they'll lose resale value faster. The drop in resale value might even put some car loans underwater (i.e. the loan is worth more then the car itself), which is the problem for the bank or loan holder if the borrower defaults on it.

* Once EV's reach price parity in initial purchase price without any government subsidies who in their right mind would buy an ICE vehicle anymore if they're in the market for a brand new vehicle? You'd be paying more money for an inferior product that costs more to refuel and maintain. Unless you have some niche case where EV's still aren't good enough (i.e. certain business cases involving the towing of heavy amounts of cargo) it just doesn't make sense. And if it doesn't make sense what do you think will happen to the sales of new ICE vehicles the automakers are still producing?

The last point is why I think it's inevitable that some of the automakers are going bankrupt if they move too slow at shifting to EVs."

Tesla is objectively overvalued by every financial measure possible. The price is all hype - *and that's okay*, there's many other companies whose stock price is driven by hype and not by product - to pretend otherwise though is absolutely silly. It may still go up, but the business' financials and fundamentals do not support that, and their competitors are catching up VERY quickly.

The entire crux of the Tesla debate is, always has been, and will continue to be: 

""Can Tesla scale up and fix it's production lines and quality control to meet demand before Volkswagen (etc.) figure out how to profitably make an electric car?""

As someone who has a side gig related to City planning let me tell you it's dead in the water. Either we build a station that charges 99% of cars, or one that does only Tesla and we pay a licensing fee for the pleasure. Tesla got greedy and screwed themselves over...adapt or die.



As for the rest it's all nice *ideas and fantasies* but I prefer to invest in actual competitive products. Tesla can't even make a battery if Elons life depends on it, they require Panasonic to do the actual work and then simply license the finished product to Tesla. Tesla doesn't have the factories or knowledge in house to make even the batteries they need today, much less tomorrow.



As for solar, energy storage etc they're one small player surrounded by major institutions, oil companies and actual electrics firms spending every R&D cent on making competitive products. This isn't like EVs where Tesla was unchallenged and got a good head start (that they squandered) this is real competitive markets from day 1 and Tesla has yet to show a product that is cheaper, or so much better the price would be justified."

Sure, they are overvalued by financial measure. You know which companies were all overvalued based on financial measures at one point? FB, Amazon, Netflix, etc., GM and Ford have a much better financial performance than Tesla, relatively speaking. Yet, they couldn't figure out that EV's were going to explode? It took a guy like Musk to change the overall market for them to realize this? See, that lack of innovation from them is why Tesla is steps ahead. 

You say they are catching up VERY quickly. How? You don't elaborate. What do you mean by catching up and based on what measures?  


You bring up P/E but you don't realize that the EV market isn't friendly on P/E precisely because EV's require a vast amount of capital to operate in since it's a relatively new market. I'd like if GM/Ford and other ICE companies that do operate in EV as well publish their financial statements just for their EV segment... I guarantee their financials would look horrible. Right now, those companies are subsidizing their ICE vehicle profit to fund their EV investment.   


So yeah, Tesla is overvalued, financially speaking. But how many people who bought Amazon back in 2015 when people kept saying they were overvalued and can't turn a profit wish they had just bought the damn stock in 2015 instead of crying about it? Tesla ain't going away and once they figure out their supply chain/tax credits get approved, I can realistically see them dominating the market."

I have just shy of a 900,000 estimate for 2021 deliveries in my spreadsheet. With even a slowdown of ramp rate to 45% yoy, you get around 4M by end of 2025.

Biggest risk is macro-economic slowdown, geo-political risk with Shanghai factory, supply chain disruption, or delays in getting Berlin online. I'm interested to see how they ramp factory construction past Berlin/Austin, and how they fund them (equity raise or debt).

2021-06-24 12:31:47,stocks,"I already made profit off TSLA. Bought at 200 pre-split and sold at 750 post-split. I don't see TSLA making 2000% gains again anytime soon, or ever for all of time for that matter.

I sold TSLA when I realized they're a failed business model without government subsidies and credits. Not saying that it's a bad investment because of that, but it's the exact same reason I'll never invest in oil. Not actually profitable, requires government aid in order to even work at all. Requires lots of subsidies and credits for the business model to work. I don't like that idea, as if TSLA ever stops receiving support from government the stock is almost certainly going to crash hard.

I've already made 2000% gains off TSLA and see much better opportunities almost everywhere else in the market. I don't think TSLA is going to 5K in 2 years."
2021-06-24 14:04:35,stocks,"Because the market can remain irrational blah blah blah.


I just won't buy it because i see a lot of risks and not that much upside."
2021-06-24 16:32:33,stocks,"Burry also said Tesla was overvalued before it skyrocketed in price.

Not even Warren Buffett is right about everything."
2021-06-24 16:01:57,stocks,Lmk when Tesla makes a new ath. So far away
2021-06-24 14:42:50,stocks,"Sure they have plans. Good for them.

Let's see if they have battery supply to make them and the demand to sell them. Examples of both of those happening? Ford limited Mach E's 1st year to 50k cars because they don't have the cells. VW's having a very hard time in China because... people don't want to buy them.

And Tesla sells EVs. But they don't compete in the 'EV market'. They compete in the vehicle market. Period. They have plenty of room to growth. And /u/Beneficial_Sense1009 laid out how they're going to do it.   


As Tesla climbs past 5M, as described, they're going to start being on lists like this. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_manufacturers\_by\_motor\_vehicle\_production#2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_manufacturers_by_motor_vehicle_production#2020)

And they'll keep climbing. Because no one else will be able to make as high quality, long range, fast charging vehicles for as little money as they're going to be selling for.  


See: 4680, LFP, and gigapress."
2021-06-24 14:44:08,stocks,Are you actually reading the articles or just linking them? 1million cars by 2025? Like how many do you think Tesla is doing by the?
2021-06-24 13:27:43,stocks,"There is no such thing as ""proof"" that can support a prediction that Tesla will be the largest company by revenue in 10 years."
2021-06-24 16:51:07,stocks,"Kinda of like you saying ""They will be one of, if not, the largest company by revenue"" and ""They have a far better product and will continue to make better products"".  

That also, makes you look uneducated."
2021-06-24 13:31:33,stocks,"Give 1 reason you think TSLA is 'by far still the best investment in the market atm'. You say I sound uneducated but our differences I am providing reasons why they're not and you're just calling me stupid lol. You have no evidence or sustenance, just bias and emotion. And you attack me when you realize I'm right and just call me stupid. You're definitely not fit to invest if it's all emotion for you.

Everything I said is correct, and you haven't really said anything other than 'TSLA moon' lol. Keep dreaming man, I'm the uneducated one. I'm stupid for selling TSLA at 2000% gains months ago at a higher price than it's been at for a while."
2021-06-24 14:00:16,stocks,"You misunderstand, they are currently disrupting them. They are not a part of the list yet. I was implying that Tesla will put them out of business."
2021-06-24 13:05:02,stocks,"I didn‚Äôt even finish reading this nonsense, how do you think they aren‚Äôt profitable? Are you insane? This is hilarious"
2021-06-24 13:50:54,stocks,Failed business model? You sound like you want to see them fail to justify your exit point at $750. I'm willing to bet as the price climbs so too will your negative posts.
2021-06-24 12:52:41,stocks,Which other opportunities do you mean?
2021-06-24 14:08:47,stocks,"That's fine, but if you're going to put a number to it then why not back it up with your dollars? 

I'm completely fine with people disagreeing with projections, market share, timelines etc. In fact that's healthy discourse. But I cannot tell you how often simply incorrect information - again, not opinions, not emotion - is spewed time and time again. It's honestly shocking, the problem is it becomes groupthink wherein enough people believe Tesla is overvalued based on incorrect information that it just becomes accepted as fact and not challenged whatsoever. If you challenge based on facts you're labeled a fan boy or someone who doesn't understand investing, DCF models or how to analyze a business. So in essence I just give up trying to explain it because it's a waste of time. In the end the numbers will prove or disprove fact from fiction so we need to let time play out."
2021-06-24 13:47:51,stocks,"There is proof pointing towards Tesla having catalysts other than bias and emotion is what I was replying to

There is however lots of ‚Äúproof‚Äù that Tesla makes a better product, expands faster, and innovates more than the competition."
2021-06-24 18:53:17,stocks,"Sure the largest by revenue is speculation, but it‚Äôs made based off facts. They do make the best products in the industry, you can‚Äôt deny this. They innovative faster than anyone, also not able to deny this. It is only a matter of time until oil is out and renewables are in, EVs are the future, and Tesla is the only company atm with a real chance of solving level 5 autonomy. Tesla is at the front of the pack and unless a very unfortunate event happens that only effects Tesla and not the industry as a whole they will keep this lead."
2021-06-24 13:55:15,stocks,"The only thing you‚Äôve said is FUD... and no I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre dumb for taking profits I think you‚Äôre dumb for not buying back in. I‚Äôve said multiple things that show why they are the best investment long term. Do you know what sectors are leading the world by revenue? Every sector that Tesla is disrupting and crushing (other than retail). Do you know what they‚Äôre profit margins are per vehicle? Multiples higher than the average of 15% in the industry... if you want facts say shit that deserves an explanation. All you said was that they aren‚Äôt profitable and that I‚Äôm trading off emotion and bias. Which is complete speculation, you have no idea who I am.

Edit: yes just downvote but don‚Äôt even try and argue, non of you bears have anything to say other than bullshit and it‚Äôs a waste of everyone‚Äôs time. If you can‚Äôt open your eyes and see the clear winner it‚Äôs not my fault. Good luck with your Ford investments.. lmao"
2021-06-24 16:14:55,stocks,"Ive no clue, they have the best car manufacturer margins Xd"
2021-06-24 13:28:13,stocks,"So you're close-minded, biased and trading off just pure emotion? Lmao, okay good luck. Already made more on TSLA than you will but keep dreaming"
2021-06-24 13:17:34,stocks,They aren‚Äôt profitable look it up. Tesla survives on energy subsidies.
2021-06-24 13:32:03,stocks,it's nonsense to those who aren't willing to understand reality lmao
2021-06-24 13:40:54,stocks,"Well, I don't like to just give tickers. But, I see opportunities for better investments than Tesla in a lot of spaces right now, including other EV investments, or car makers in general. Also plenty of other sectors. I'm eyeing biotech companies, tech companies, solar, agricultural/climate plays and some boring stuff as well."
2021-06-24 16:38:07,stocks,"Tesla is overvalued because:

1. Their FSD technology is a farce given their approach and the hardware installed on the cars rolling off the line. They simply do not have enough onboard compute for sufficient perception, prediction, planning, and localization.

2. Every OEM has launched or is launching their own EV and none of them are using Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äúcoveted‚Äù battery tech that, according to many around here, was their moat. Moreover, many of these vehicles are equipped with the same level of autonomy as what is being on the Teslas.

3. Tesla has a major servicing issue, it currently takes weeks or months to get your Tesla fixed if something goes wrong. This is a surefire way to build a negative reputation and lose your customer base once the shimmer of the brand wears off."
2021-06-24 15:17:02,stocks,"I‚Äôll tell you exactly why. 

1) Shorts imply time. You have to be right in a certain time frame, or u can‚Äôt be wrong in the mean time even though you‚Äôre right in the long run. If you‚Äôre long, and the stock goes down, nothing happens. There‚Äôs no margin call

2) Because I would never place a bet on the market acting irrational. For example, watch The Big Short. The sub prime market went UP once things started to collapse"
2021-06-24 19:33:40,stocks,"All of those things can be true, and it still wouldn't mean they would be the largest company by revenue.  You sound like you listen to a bunch of Tesla bulls and don't get any other input aside from snarky reddit comments.  

The point is, you post a bunch of speculation, valid or invalid, and then call others uneducated for disagreeing with you and not posting ""proof"", telling people to ""read more"".... it just makes you sound like a Tesla-tard."
2021-06-24 13:50:52,stocks,"Just because a company is not posting profits does not mean they can not be profitable, Tesla could turn a profit at any second they decided to if they were not investing back into themselves. I can understand why you said what you said based off my last comment. But I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have assumed you‚Äôd understand this"
2021-06-24 14:03:42,stocks,"Mirror much? There's plenty of data out there to support a large TAM across several sectors and 50% yearly growth with automotive production. This is based on models and math. You don't have to agree with them and that's fine, but labeling this as some emotionally based investing thesis is put simply, lame and reflexive."
2021-06-24 13:25:17,stocks,"We are aware of this, ever heard of R&D? Innovation ? Investing in themselves, they don‚Äôt need to post profits when their goal is expansion. Not even sure why I need to explain this"

2021-06-24 13:53:39,stocks,You're the one that needs to look it up.  Information is there to those that care enough to think before forming ignorant and incorrect opinions.
2021-06-24 13:57:14,stocks,"I wish you luck in your investing future, it‚Äôs clear we won‚Äôt agree on anything other than us not seeing eye to eye."
2021-06-24 13:42:07,stocks,Which BioTech? I've had beam for a while and just picked up some pavm.
2021-06-24 14:36:53,stocks,If anything what I said tells that I put too much emotion into my reddit replies lol
2021-06-24 15:43:34,stocks,If you think the big dogs of the automotive world can‚Äôt catch up to aspergers boy and Tesla you‚Äôre tripping lol
2021-06-24 13:59:10,stocks,"I know what you're saying, and I typically avoid saying anything either because it's the same people who form lazy opinions without actually doing any DD (and not what you read in paid media headline) that won't be open to reason and logic. 

I've come to the conclusion some people are simply hardwired to only believing what they want and refuse to listen to anything other than confirmation bias fodder.  If you challenge it you'll be called names, told you're a meme stock investor, don't understand how to do a DCF, you name it. They can shelter their ego, I'll pad my portfolio over the coming years. To each their own."
2021-06-24 16:00:45,stocks,Awww Tesla bag holderrrrr madddddd
2021-06-24 13:44:01,stocks,"beam is good, i also like crsp. But there's more as well, I'm looking at ABCL and NVTA and Edit all as well. Just do DD because this space is pretty speculative. Markets for these stocks can move up to 30% a day on a crazy day"
2021-06-24 16:32:10,stocks,"You need to do more research man, Tesla‚Äôs technology is far ahead and gaining more of a lead everyday... they‚Äôve had way to much time to catch up and are still in the dust. VW will do fine, Ford might make it out. The rest will be fighting over scraps and merging, luxury brands like Porsche will stay luxury and not compete against Tesla directly."
2021-06-24 13:53:10,stocks,Yeah tell me about it. Beam is a rollercoaster. I've seen it go up 15 percent at peak and then finish under a percent up.
2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"What‚Äôs the similarity in SPY and VOO, in layman‚Äôs terms? I‚Äôve seen people call them basically the same, with similar input on VTI. 

Can someone please explain why people say they‚Äôre basically the same? I‚Äôve got SPYG, VOO, and VXUS right now. Would it make more since for me to rotate into a different or more diverse ETF?"
2021-06-24 11:13:22,stocks,"voo is lower expense ratio- better for investing

spy is much more liquid- better for trading and options"
2021-06-24 11:08:19,stocks,"They both track the S&P 500.  Their investment results should be identical, so any difference would be from their management expenses."
2021-06-24 15:05:23,stocks,For all intents and purposes you can also consider FNILX for tax-deferred accounts (still mutual fund structure so there are annual distributions). Zero fees (though we are splitting hairs here) and functionally the same as the others (they just don‚Äôt license the S&P 500 index so they can offer it for free)
2021-06-24 11:09:24,stocks,"Both $VOO and $SPY track the top 500 companies. They have SLIGHTLY different weights of each stock, but not by much. $VOO has the lowest fees, which is why Warren Buffett recommends it."
2021-06-24 11:44:34,stocks,I am in $SPY and VT.  SPY lets me sell covered calls.
2021-06-24 13:57:48,stocks,VOO premiums suck! But I am up 71% on it.
2021-06-24 11:09:59,stocks,"SPY and VOO are both cap weighted SP 500.
VOO has a cheaper expense ratio, SPY is more liquid.
They're basically the same for all intensive purposes.
You can buy either."
2021-06-24 11:09:23,stocks,They‚Äôre almost identical funds managed by different brokerages.
2021-06-24 11:09:47,stocks,Or you could just Google this.
2021-06-24 13:36:44,stocks,"You nailed it.  I day trade SPY, but hold about 1/5 of my net worth in VOO."
2021-06-24 16:39:34,stocks,"I used to do that until I decided to put my long-term savings into ETFs instead of mutual funds.  The way I see it, I pay the measly 0.03% expense ratio for the privilege of having the ability to immediately pull everything out if the market suddenly goes tits up.  Can't put a trailing stop loss on a mutual fund."
2021-06-24 11:22:20,stocks,intents and purposes
2021-06-24 14:38:40,stocks,"I could Google, and I did Google, but I liked your 1 sentence explanation better haha"
2021-06-24 15:08:09,stocks,"Excuse my ignorance, but how exactly do you make a profit day trading SPY, a ticker that maybe goes up or down 1% in a week? Even if I put $10k in, that‚Äôd only be a return of $100/week or $20/day. 

Are you catching multiple spikes a day/week or something? Or perhaps you‚Äôre trading with large volumes of money (1% of $1m is $10k; that‚Äôs not bad!)? Or are you day trading options?

Just curious, because I‚Äôve generally only seen people day trade more volatile stocks, which SPY is not. Though I could see that being an advantage when it comes to not risking *losing* money."
2021-06-24 16:55:27,stocks,"Yeah that‚Äôs fair. That‚Äôs why I specified tax deferred accounts. Fully agreed liquidity and tax advantaged status makes ETFs better in non retirement accounts. For retirement accounts, why not save the extra 3bps"
2021-06-24 11:28:18,stocks,TIL lol thanks
2021-06-24 16:10:59,stocks,He probably trades 5-7dte options and sells before the day ends
2021-06-24 15:32:33,stocks,"I don't know if he's serious. I've only been actively investing since the beginning of the pandemic, and I've bought a little of VOO and SPY. They both are up, 41% higher YTD.  Maybe more experience shows a different trend. But just FYI, they've perform about the same, recently."
2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"NVDA: Good time to get in? A split is coming in July 20th which might bring new retail investors in since it would be a more affordable stock. Second, with the whole Crypto boom going down, GPUs are becoming cheaper which will be easily bought by gamers. I myself am one of them and with prices going down, I know lots of gamers will take advantage to buy them."
2021-06-24 11:30:45,stocks,"I looked at it at $250 and decided it was too expensive.

I looked at it at 400 and decided it was too expensive.

Again at $550 and, yep, too expensive.

So, what do I think, today?  I think it's too expensive.

You are welcome!"
2021-06-24 15:17:05,stocks,"I think it's hyped up enough right now to push into the $800 dollar territory before it splits. And once it splits, I think it will get pumped up once more when the price per share becomes more affordable.

I have nothing to back that up other than my gut feeling. That why I picked up ten shares."
2021-06-24 10:57:06,stocks,Maybe AMD is a better buy at current prices.
2021-06-24 10:55:30,stocks,The rally for Nvda already gone‚Ä¶ maybe a bit late‚Ä¶ but who knows ^^
2021-06-24 12:46:40,stocks,I didn't properly understand the split/special dividend and missed my chance to buy by this past Monday. Right now I'm keeping my eye on it but don't plan to make a move until after the split to see how it behaves at the lowered price point.
2021-06-24 11:00:42,stocks,AMD and MU are bargains compared to NVDA. Disclaimer-I‚Äôm long AMD.
2021-06-24 10:55:58,stocks,It‚Äôs my best stock.  Right now may not be the best time to buy.  It‚Äôs at an all time high and the rsi is in overbought territory.  Could wait for a pull back to get in.
2021-06-24 12:00:46,stocks,"I've had a couple shares since NVDA traded at $80.   

We're right next to an ATH. If you want to get in wait until the split happens. This stock is dumb, if it drops 20% it's up 40% by EOY. NVDA still has a lot to give - its' processors are in fucking everything, and its' been quietly pushing into AI tech lately."
2021-06-24 15:46:04,stocks,"Best time was yesterday.  Next best time is today.  NVDA is long term winner.  Also like AMD, TSM and the semi caps LRCX, AMAT, KLAC, ASLM."
2021-06-24 13:45:14,stocks,"I think it's going to go up! Chip shortage is going to last for at least three years, and NVDA has a monopoly. AMD chips are great, but both are targeting different markets!"
2021-06-24 13:53:22,stocks,"I was holding NVDA until this week. Bought in at $562, sold at $750. Sold it to lock in gains, put 90% of profits into VTI and other short term plays, the other 10% just to keep some cash on hand. 

I‚Äôll go back into NVDA once it splits. I believe heavily in the company, just don‚Äôt want any single company to dominate more then 5% of my portfolio."
2021-06-24 12:40:01,stocks,Just look at NVDA‚Äôs P/E ratio compared to competitors and the tech industry as a whole. It‚Äôs about 3x more which typically indicates the current price is overvalued.
2021-06-24 19:34:44,stocks,"Everybody on this sub sucks AMD's cock and looks at NVDA as a threat, even though they both exist and thrive together"
2021-06-24 10:55:41,stocks,"Yes it is a good buy now, should go to 800 eom"
2021-06-24 11:17:46,stocks,It's already shot up a ton u should've gotten in before
2021-06-24 11:37:13,stocks,I wouldn't say so. NVDA could tank if crypto mining gets regulated more heavily. Their homebrewed method of regulating it is just pissing off their customers and isn't sustainable...
2021-06-24 19:01:19,stocks, Bruh intc is the play rn
2021-06-24 16:03:27,stocks,"I own both, though have twice as much money in AMD.

NVDA has been one of my biggest gainers recently."
2021-06-24 15:32:32,stocks,"i think it is close to the max. after split, I think it would drop down like tesla. Now, it is overbought i i think because of split."
2021-06-24 15:22:29,stocks,Chart looks good and has more upside. I think it will go up to $850 before the split. https://i.imgur.com/HcME8J4.png
2021-06-24 18:52:18,stocks,"It has had a good run. Usually AMD follows where NVDA is going... AMD still low.

I think that is a better paly."
2021-06-24 12:53:45,stocks,"i‚Äôd say it‚Äôs too late for nvidia, i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll go higher, but you can‚Äôt afford to buy enough share to be worth the profits, you‚Äôd be better off buying something cheaper."
2021-06-24 15:13:50,stocks,Ask yourself what happened to the price of other companies directly following a split...
2021-06-24 19:13:14,stocks,"If GPU prices are going down, then Nvidia revenue will go... down? How is that a good thing?"
2021-06-24 19:38:41,stocks,If I buy now then do my shares get split on July 20th?
2021-06-24 13:12:33,stocks,Same goes with TSLA...
2021-06-24 13:54:09,stocks,"I own both and AMD is the better option here. NVDA has a bigger moat, but AMD is primed for huge success for the next few years. 50% Revenue growth this year and massive earnings growth. Thanks Intel."
2021-06-24 12:52:21,stocks,true
2021-06-24 11:16:55,stocks,Could go up could go down
2021-06-24 16:32:51,stocks,"In my opinion, if you buy now, you'd be buying at the top of the NVDA craze, meaning I think it will actually start going down soon. I could be wrong, though, and it could continue to go to the moon."
2021-06-24 16:43:11,stocks,I mean I just sold so now it's gonna double.
2021-06-24 13:15:58,stocks,Long on AMD üöÄ
2021-06-24 13:55:34,stocks,"There‚Äôs a lot more to it than that. You have to take into account future / forecasted earnings potential. P/E only gives us insight into where the stock is trading in relation to current earnings. Simply put, you can‚Äôt just compare the P/E of two company‚Äôs and make a decision based on that alone."
2021-06-24 16:20:10,stocks,Glad I didn't sell based on this analysis

2021-06-24 16:05:50,stocks,Wtf?
2021-06-24 19:16:09,stocks,Not how it works
2021-06-24 19:31:23,stocks,Not necessarily. With prices going down I refer to those of GPU scalpers. Nvidia sells its GPU at the usual price but very few people manage to buy GPUs at MSRP
2021-06-24 15:26:15,stocks,I thought tsla was good during that big dip some months ago but i didn't have free cash at the time.
2021-06-24 16:22:07,stocks,TSLA is incredibly overvalued given that so many more EVs are starting to enter the market.
2021-06-24 14:54:50,stocks,I own both as well and I think AMD has a better chance of growth but NVDA is more stable long term.
2021-06-24 16:05:36,stocks,What price would be good to get into?
2021-06-24 12:08:11,stocks,100% it will go right though.
2021-06-24 12:59:36,stocks,You said like a $$$-analyst from fucking old rich bank. For any stock.
2021-06-24 15:45:33,stocks,I got AMAT as a sister stock :)
2021-06-24 16:07:42,stocks,"True, you have to take into account the number of outstanding shares as well when making P/E comparisons. And I absolutely agree, you should look at EPS and projected EPS. But taking all of that into consideration, at the current trading levels, NVDA still looks slightly overvalued. I think the analysis average is somewhere around $737 so the current price is about 4.2% higher than the average. Is that a reasonable margin of error? I think so, but I‚Äôd wait for it to drop a bit and buy. I personally think NVDA is a great company and has a bright future."

Teslas marketshare is shrinking, fast, hence Elon bend sover backwards to please Xi Jinping of ""communist"" China hoping for a golden deal. To be honest I don't know how Tesla managed to fuck up such a great head start, it would be as if people ditched MS office for open office or Windows for a new Linux dist. As for solar batteries (made by Panasonic lol) there are already other successful brands, Tesla don't get a first mover advantage. The stock had a cult following for now, I'd be curious to see where that stands in 5 years if they keep losing marketshare and hence ""wow factor"""

But here‚Äôs the problem, if I sell now, with short term taxes I‚Äôm forced to pay a decent amount to Uncle Sam, considering I‚Äôve held for less than a year. I really want to lock in some of these gains, but I also think it might be better to hold for atleast a year for tax benefits. Anybody in the same situation or have an advice or experience?"

Either way, Uncle Sam will get his cut.

If it's another 8-10 months, do you anticipate the market will decline and you would've been better off paying the higher rate to lock in the gains? Let's say you're in the 24% bracket and selling the unrealized gains pushes those gains into the 32% tax bracket. Do you think your gains are worth the 17% higher taxes as compared to the 15% long-term? You gotta work your own situation out and do what's best for you.

Personally, that‚Äôs how I run my portfolio. I‚Äôm more concerned with generating passive income than gains of selling stocks. If I like the company, I‚Äôll just DRIP my dividend and continue to collect premium. If you do this in an LLC, you have a lot more flexibility with how you show gains. As an individual, you are taxed based on your ordinary income bracket for ST or 0, 10, 15 LT based on that same bracket.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Why I'm So Bullish on $CAT **Caterpillar ($CAT)** is the global leader and largest producer of construction and mining equipment for a reason, and with all the looming infrastructure talks I'm more bullish on Caterpillar than ever. They have set themselves up perfectly to benefit exponentially from the increase in demand in the construction and mining sectors. The $117 billion market capitalization company also provides diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. At the time of writing this they are up 74% YTD.

&#x200B;

**Financials & Growth Prospective:**  Caterpillar has experienced a 74% year-over-year improvement in the first-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share to $1.93, while revenues increased 12% year over year to $11.9 billion. Over the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Caterpillar for fiscal 2021 has increased around 17%. The consensus mark for fiscal 2022 has also been revised upward by 11% over the same time frame. Caterpillar has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 41.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2021 for Caterpillar is currently pegged at $9.60, suggesting year-over-year growth of 46%. For fiscal 2022, the estimate for earnings is at $11.91, indicating year-over-year improvement of 24%.

We can expect that the growth in construction -- not just in the U.S. but worldwide -- will allow Caterpillar to grow earnings-per-share by more than 40% in 2021. This would leave the bottom line still much lower than its pre-pandemic highs, but it would be a very good showing nonetheless. With a new annualized dividend of $4.44 ($1.11/quarter) as of August 20th, 2020, and an expectation for earnings-per-share of $9.20 for 2021, Caterpillar has a projected payout ratio of 48%. This is slightly above the average payout ratio of 45% since 2011. The dividend appears to be well-covered and unlikely to be cut even if earnings-per-share experience another significant decline.

&#x200B;

**In The News:**

* **Collaborative development of zero-emission mining equipment:** $CAT recently entered into a collaboration agreement with Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. to develop, test and produce zero-emission machines for the latter‚Äôs Matawinie graphite mine. Caterpillar expects to become the exclusive supplier of an all-electric mining fleet for the mine by 2028. The Matawinie project, which will provide high-purity graphite concentrate for electric vehicles, is planned to be the first open pit operation in the world that will exclusively use electric equipment. This is an important milestone in the mining industry as it can be used as a launch pad for other miners focused on cutting down their emissions utilizing Caterpillar‚Äôs cutting-edge technologies.
* **Rio Tinto Plc announced it will deploy the world‚Äôs first fully autonomous water truck in partnership with Caterpillar:** This will be located at its $2.6 billion Gudai-Darri iron ore mine in Western Australia‚Äôs Pilbara region. Water spraying is a vital part of mining operations and this new technology will enhance productivity by enabling digital tracking of water consumption, while cutting down water wastage. Rio Tinto intends to make Gudai-Darri one of the world‚Äôs most technologically advanced mines. Cutting down mining sector‚Äôs carbon emissions is the need of the hour. Day by day, more and more mining companies are exploring options to electrify their mines. The switch from diesel to electricity will also cut costs and boost their license to operate. Electrified mines will require less maintenance and human intervention. The use of automation and the Internet of Things (IoT) will increase as drones, autonomous vehicles and remote-controlled operational systems are rolled out more widely across mining operations.

They're waiting to see what the competition does and probably won't have anything concrete to buy before 2025. Meanwhile you can already buy some heavy duty vehicles for Underground operations from both Sandvik and Epiroc. Both of which are good long term plays as well in my opinion."

I saw today this article announcing expansion in Central Asia. I think Wendy‚Äôs has lots of room to expand globally and am excited to see them working to capture market share. Wanted to see what everyone else thinks about the growth prospects over the next 5 years or so

They already removed bacon and tomato on the chicken sandwich option. Their breakfast is actually really good, but it needs more advertising because McDonalds is pushing their breakfast even harder. The Twitter account seems to be losing momentum as well. They did spend money on a disstape, its not terrible. Wendys needs another kick in the pants to get things going.

The most common fast foods in Asia are local favorites like dumplings, noodles, and fried tofu.  You are an ethnocentric American to believe hamburgers define fast food service.

Read the stock section in the newspaper instead of the comics and ""paper traded"" for several years. My favorite stock was Exxon.

When I turned 12, my parents set up a UGMA account for me. I took my birthday gift money i had been saving and bought Toledo Edison stock (became Centerior Energy and is now First Energy). I reinvested everything, and ended up selling most of it in my 30s for $5000 (would be worth $13000 today.) 

Once I had the account set up, all I had to do was call the broker to place any orders. Traded regularly throughout jr high and high school.

If you wanted, they'd mail you physical stock certificates.

And the commission for making a single trade something like $50. Day trading was still a thing then, but traders were basically on the phone all day with various brokers buying and selling.

Regular investors were blind to intraday action and you had to trust that your broker had good traders in the pit who could negotiate your orders and get you a decent price.  

All we knew of stock prices was their end of day print, although financial newspapers would show a column with the low, high, and total volume.   Sometimes a stock's printed numbers would be behind by a day or two.

A big advance was getting quotes that were ""only"" 15 minutes old.

2021-06-24 11:21:53,stocks,I think 110% financing stopped in the 90s. I remember advertisement on how you could buy a house and money for remodeling with the mortgage.
2021-06-24 15:29:52,stocks,"Cost of building: $100,000

Cost of G&A, electricity, water, property taxes for the year: $10,000

Mortgage due on the building: $110,000

Debt remaining on asset / FMV of asset = 110%

If you're to begin a real estate company, and you're financing all of the assets you hold title to with a single loan. What are you going to pay the utility company to keep the lights on or pay your employees until you can start generating cash organically? Hopes and dreams?

Plus, if you're a lender, just financing the cost of the land/commercial property without any liquidity to keep the lights on probably means that the creditor is going to default pretty quickly and the bank will be holding the bag. And it's a greater principal base on which to collect interest. 

Pretty straight forward small business 101."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"CRM shares outstanding increase each year Hi All,

Very new to investing and have a basic question.

Although the stockmarket is at an ATH I want to start investing by DCA'ing into a couple of companies which I plan to hold for at least 10 year

I'm researching CRM and most metrics seem good to my untrained eye.

Revenue is growing strong, although quite a bit of growth is due to acquisition, EBITDA and levered free cash flow both grow annually and debt to equity ratio is declining for the last 5 years and now at 0.60.

The only red flag so to speak is the amount of shares outstanding increases every year.

Is this something to be worried about?"
2021-06-24 08:36:30,stocks,"Share dilution is something to be worried about. It essentially means that every year your ownership in the business is shrinking. Personally, if I see a company a pattern where more shares are issued every year, I would factor that into my valuation models as a conservative approach. 

It‚Äôs hard to tell whether it is necessarily a bad thing. You could look at the per share metrics of revenue, earnings, etc. to see if each share is earning less with the dilution. Some companies issue shares as a means to finance their company when the management believes their share price is overvalued. In a similar fashion, if the management believes their company is undervalued, they might buyback shares."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Doximity IPO Today Let me preface this by saying that I‚Äôm a doctor and I use this app every day. Also, I have bought 250 shares pre-ipo due to using app and having a fidelity account, special pre-ipo they offered healthcare workers. 

Today is the IPO of Doximity. It is an app (saas) that is a mix between telehealth and a social media platform for doctors, nurse practitioners, PAs, dentists, etc. They are one of a kind in that they‚Äôre the only ones with this scope in the industry having the social media platform plus telehealth all in one. 80% (me included) of all doctors in the US use doximity. They also allow you to find jobs in your field and keep you up to date on the latest research. It is going to debut for 26$ and boy is that a deal. 

This business has a market cap around 4 bil and is the market leader in an industry (telehealth, social media for professionals) that is about to drip like the oil boom. According to their S1, this industry is worth ~18 bil and is growing rapidly. That is telehealth. That does not include all the other aspects of this business. Last year alone over 63 million telehealth visits occurred. There are so many implications for this service (seeing patients unable to make it to clinic, counseling, etc). This is just the tip of the ice berg. With the money from the ipo they plan to grow rapidly and may incorporate an electronic medical records with this service eventually, which is fucking huge. It would make my life so much easier lol. 

Within the last year revenue grew 78% from 116.4 mil to 206 mil. They also are already positive with earnings. Their biggest competitor, tdoc, (look at what they ipo at and now) are not profitable. This company is about to fucking boom don‚Äôt miss out. I‚Äôve included a few of my sources.

2021-06-24 16:53:55,stocks,Bought the full reserved shares at $26. Already profited. Funny how all the stock and residency subreddits were shutting on this because of general financial illiteracy.
2021-06-24 09:35:46,stocks,Another physician here buying at IPO. Use their telemedicine app every week and see the value first hand. Anyone who has read their S1 can see that they've made considerable revenue over the last 2 years and have become profitable. The comments by other physicians here shows clearly why we in the medical field are so financially illiterate.
2021-06-24 13:49:12,stocks,"Ugh, wanted to buy today but I can't justify buying in at over $40/share. I'll wait it out on the hope that there's a pull back. Very interested under ~$33/share"
2021-06-24 10:07:30,stocks,"I‚Äôm in, hopefully getting a good price on ipo!"
2021-06-24 11:07:18,stocks,"I'm in. Their financials are juicy and their HIPAA-secure video chat is the best one I have used out of several platforms. They're profitable, they have a solid product, and they have somewhat diversified revenue streams (telehealth, marketing, recruiting). A lot of physicians are not aware of their actual business model, especially those who are not doing a lot of telehealth and only exposure to Doximity is as  linkedin or facebook for doctors."
2021-06-24 09:04:15,stocks,"Ya I wouldnt touch them with a 10 foot pole. Source, also a physician. The only useful thing they have is the app to hide your number to call patients"
2021-06-24 13:25:37,stocks,Can someone explain to me why every bullish post in this thread is from someone with under 2-300 karma? And why OP is literally responding to every single bearish comment like a sleazy salesman trying his darndest to get them to see the light and buy a big bag?
2021-06-24 08:55:42,stocks,Trash company that does literally nothing. Source am a physician
2021-06-24 17:26:26,stocks,No shit lol I‚Äôve been in the market from a young age. My family stressed early on and then medical school came later on. It‚Äôs a great company. The haters can keep hating while I buy a new range
2021-06-24 09:56:47,stocks,They probably don‚Äôt use their telehealth services and/or are surgeons and therefore are irrelevant lol or they‚Äôre Med students
2021-06-24 14:02:56,stocks,This going to 150+ like teledoc did
2021-06-24 10:08:28,stocks,"Only thing to compare it to is tdoc. Major difference between the two: tdoc isn‚Äôt profitable, docs is lol"
2021-06-24 11:41:08,stocks,"Very true. The potential is so massive. Especially if they‚Äôre able to secure an EMR and expand their reach into other specialties (counseling, pharmacy, etc.). The ceo also created epocrates"

2021-06-24 13:57:45,stocks,OP probably bought in pre-IPO and is now trying to get others to fill his bag before he cashes out
2021-06-24 13:37:31,stocks,Us with karma under 200-300 is cause we are docs and work a shit ton and don‚Äôt have time to post memes and shit!
2021-06-24 13:36:28,stocks,Cause I got some free time you bozo
2021-06-24 09:05:42,stocks,What don‚Äôt you like? Lol do you use their service every day like I do?
2021-06-24 13:25:04,stocks,Up 40% on open! Those physicians who turned this down must be kicking themselves right now. There really needs to be more financial education for our peers.
2021-06-24 14:35:52,stocks,"I could see that happening with their margins and revenue growth. But ~$44/share is too rich a valuation even taking into consideration future revenue multiples. Awesome that you were able to get in at the IPO price though! Hoping for the typical drop in the weeks after IPO before takeoff like $RBLX, $ABNB, $SNOW etc.

Also, from my understanding TDOC and DOCS are almost entirely different businesses. I get that DOCS has a telehealth segment that they recently launched but the majority of their revenue comes from pharmaceutical advertising whereas TDOC contracts with health plans and fortune 500 companies for subscription revenue. I think both have amazing potential but I don't really view them as comparable"
2021-06-24 09:09:57,stocks,"I just dont think its going to take off as a ""social media"" platform, and breaking into EMR is very difficult and a huge task that will take billions in capital"
2021-06-24 14:29:31,stocks,Ya seems like it
2021-06-24 13:46:20,stocks,"Oh ok now I got it. After reading your post history and a few replies, you got in at pre-IPO prices and are now on here shilling the shit out of it so that you can cash out near the top."
2021-06-24 09:55:11,stocks,Use their service for what? I just see spam mail every now and then and colleagues answering dumb questions on forums
2021-06-24 15:30:59,stocks,Life comes at you fast
2021-06-24 15:37:54,stocks,Doximity does that with hospitals as well. Our clinic and hospital system are contracted through them. I‚Äôm at a university hospital. The other big Med school/university in my state is also contracted with them. I‚Äôd assume eventually this will be a switching cost moat. Too early to tell tho
2021-06-24 09:14:12,stocks,That‚Äôs one reason they are raising capital
2021-06-24 15:13:19,stocks,"Well, it‚Äôs up 77% right now, on its first day. It seems like following OP‚Äôs advice would have been pretty smart. But hey you‚Äôre the doctor!"
2021-06-24 14:07:04,stocks,"I ain‚Äôt no shill bud. I only post my longs. I don‚Äôt do short positions or options like a bitch. I‚Äôm into making money long term. This is a great deal. If you don‚Äôt want it then move along. Docs who use this daily, me, know the full potential of this company. I‚Äôm also long on VIAC, VST, CE, JMIA, PLTR, AFL, ALL, STWD, CTRE, O, STAG, HMC, CURLF. I‚Äôve posted about those in the past too. Bet you think I‚Äôm shilling on those too but nope. Some of those I‚Äôve had for years. My family has held aapl since ipo. I‚Äôm doing this with docs. So gtfo unless you have something to add lmao. Otherwise be poor."
2021-06-24 14:02:34,stocks,I‚Äôm holding to 150+ dawg
2021-06-24 09:56:01,stocks,My clinic and hospital use it for telehealth
2021-06-24 10:08:49,stocks,I dunno man. I think this is 1 of those situations where you think it‚Äôs a good investment because you use the product when in reality it‚Äôs a pretty meh company. But hoping best for you. We physicians need sone lucky breaks with our investments.
2021-06-24 10:29:15,stocks,What‚Äôs so good about their platform Vs teladoc or zoom
2021-06-24 10:10:05,stocks,Yes we do. I don‚Äôt let my emotions control my investments. I base them off of fundamentals and numbers. This is an extremely good deal but to each there own.

2021-06-24 07:32:02,stocks,"From my understanding, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are basically under government control. The majority of profits they make end up going to the government. The court case yesterday ruled in favor of the government. Essentially, profits will remain going to the government instead of the investor. That's a very watered down version though.

Here's a good breakdown of what they actually do and why they're beneficial to the mortgage market.

https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/fannie-mae-vs-freddie-mac"
2021-06-24 07:51:51,stocks,"I went to Google news and this was the first thing that came up.  It explains why the price dropped significantly.  Has nothing to do with thinking people will start defaulting on mortgages.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fannie-freddie-investors-mixed-ruling-142547287.html"
2021-06-24 09:25:59,stocks,"Due to an agreement following the 2008 financial crisis, the government takes almost all the profits from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. As a result, there is nothing to give to shareholders (previously, these stocks paid nice dividends). 

There was a lawsuit that bag holders from 2008 hoped would free the entities from government control. But the Supreme Court basically rejected most of it. As a result, it seems as if at least one or several of these large bag holders sold, taking profits (these stocks could be had for pennies in years after the crisis), and choosing not to wait until (or if) Fannie and Freddie will be released from control."
2021-06-24 09:36:53,stocks,"Fannie Mae and its relative Freddie Mac are both mortgage purchasers & guarantors. If your parents have a mortgage, there are odds that either Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have bought that mortgage from your lender, and either hold that mortgage in their portfolios or have packaged that mortgage into MBS‚Äôs to sell to investors."
2021-06-24 10:08:03,stocks,"So I won't reiterate what others have said in here that the dive was tied to the SCOTUS decision, but I will say I actually believe people may be a little quick to just assume the current administration will just go right back to sweeping profits and not evaluate the GSEs for the next 3 and a half years (at minimum). 

National Association of Realtors yesterday commented on the SCOTUS decision and reiterated that they believed the best path forward for the GSEs is a utility model. The idea has been tossed around out there for years (starting with Hilary's campaign). Also, advocated by Susan Wachter who was cited as a potential replacement as the FHFA director earlier this year. It's an intriguing idea because you would basically get the best of both worlds, government would be able to maintain a high level of control and regulations on the GSEs. The downside of the current model, if a housing collapse were to replicate itself, taxpayers would get hurt with the burden of it. An infusion of private capital would basically give a layer of protection as they would lose their money first in that scenario, allow the GSEs to be more dynamic, and actually could promote the current administration core objective of affordable housing. The idea of full privatization is likely gone and honestly probably pretty dangerous, but a utility model could allow the government to maintain strict control, allow for an infusion of private capital, and maybe even give current shareholders the win they are desperately looking for (my guess is in this scenario legacy shares would be either built into the capital structure or settled).

I'm not saying the GSEs are a buy, there is still massive risk here with a downside of $0. Just I think it'll be intriguing to see how this plays out here and I think way too many people are just writing off the current administration coming up with a solution that wouldn't end terribly for shareholders."
2021-06-24 13:24:00,stocks,"This is an old WSB favourite.  There was even a user who invested millions in it and at one point went to DC to convince senators to release it from government conservatorship.  The play was eventually the government will release it from their control and the stock would sky rocket.

FNMA is a cash cow for the government.  Its going to be difficult for the government to let it go.  Don't invest in a company where all the profits go to the government and none to the shareholders.  You might as well pay extra on your taxes."
2021-06-24 13:48:47,stocks,"They gambled that investors would receive the profit, the government decided not to do that, so all these similar stocks tanked.  Nothing more than that."

 >A government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) is a type of financial services corporation created by the United States Congress. Their intended function is to enhance the flow of credit to targeted sectors of the economy, to make those segments of the capital market more efficient and transparent, and to reduce the risk to investors and other suppliers of capital. The desired effect of the GSEs is to enhance the availability and reduce the cost of credit to the targeted borrowing sectors primarily by reducing the risk of capital losses to investors: agriculture, home finance and education.

2021-06-24 10:16:00,stocks,"Hey all -- just wanted to say thanks for this community. You all helped get me through the pain of holding with a portfolio that got as bad as -15% after buying so many stocks at Feb ATH's. I held through the tech correction of the past 4.5 months and at long last, my portfolio just entered green for the first time since Feb. I know things can quickly turn negative. But I'm in for the long term. My experience, as short as it has been, just shows you how important it is to not just trust your picks and hold through the ups and down, but also how good it was to see others were going through the same thing. Keep strong everyone!

Some examples:

I saw my 1,200 shares of AAPL go from my 127 buy price in August to 106, up to 144, down to 119, back up to 140, down to 124, and up and down several times, and is now back to Feb levels at 134.

I saw my PYPL shares go from my buy price of 253 to 310, down to 222 and now back up to 290.

I saw my CSTL shares go from 74 to 50 and now back to 75 (its ATH is 106).

I saw TSLA go from 860 to 400, back now to 683 (still a long way to go on this one lol).

I saw AMD go from 88 to 74 to 88 to 74 and now at 86 (almost there).

I bought into some new positions at the lows of the past few months (when I was fearful and pretty beat up with my other stocks), and those are doing well for me.

All in all, I am now at a point where I can hold my jewels and start looking at getting out of some I don't care for.

ALSO gained some valuable lessons, biggest of which is: DON'T FOMO. I fomo'd into stocks I was watching right at the top because they were suddenly on a rip and I was worried I wouldn't get in. Caused me to disregard the price I wanted to enter at. Pretty much all of these stocks dipped either later that day or a few days later to my buy price. Lesson: stick to your plan, don't focus on the literal second-to-second trading.

Another lesson: be leery of buying and selling in pre market. It can be misleading in both directions from the open market. I still struggle with this but more often then not I'll be glad I held off.

Another lesson: there usually is a morning dip at open or a little bit after; or sometimes an afternoon dip. If you're eying a stock, you might be able to catch a better deal on one of those dips.

Final lesson: I'm still working on this. I'm a long-term investor but the Feb ATH still messes with me. Figure out your entry and exit plans for a stock. When PYPL hit 310 I wish I sold because it dropped way down to 228. I'm now going to see what I do if it gets to that point again. Any advice on this for long-term holders?"

2021-06-24 15:38:49,stocks,"SND - Smart Sand Inc.

This will be a short and sweet bullet point bullish analysis and my first one here so please be gentle. I am working on a more in depth DD with my wrinkle brained brother (we predicted the March pop up in a certain gaming stock by analyzing OTM calls and puts [Our prediction post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyfns1/gme_gamma_squoze_has_started/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb) ) but I am jacked to the tits at the possibility here. 

Smart Sand Inc is a company that sells needed sand to oil drilling/fracking companies for operation of wells. They survived covid and although revenues have been down a bit it's mostly from a loss of payment from Wells Inc. See below

BULISH AF because:

- Company paid off debts and reduced operating costs DURING COVID see quarterly report here: [Latest Qtrly Report](https://sec.report/Document/0001529628-21-000133/)

- Expanded their footprint by adding rail lines and acquiring Eagle Materials DURING covid: [Eagle Aquisition ](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/18/2096056/0/en/Smart-Sand-Inc-Completes-Acquisition-of-Eagle-Materials-Inc-Oil-and-Gas-Proppants-Segment.html) 

- Price of oil is going up which *should* lead to higher demand

- SUPER low P/E ratio indicating massively undervalued

- Just WON a lawsuit against Wells Inc. for $54 million dollars that is supposed to be finalized by the ""end of June"" (MAJOR catalyst IMO): [Won MAJOR court case!!!](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/smart-sand-shares-rise-20-after-verdict-against-u-s-well-services-271622827552?mod=mw_quote_news)

2021-06-24 09:51:55,stocks,"To be very fair, it wasn't him saying so, it was more talking about what Larry Williams said and typical seasonality in the second half in June.

The problem that cropped up is the Dow was already crazy oversold and already had lost an important area for the second time in the year (I don't think it touched the 100 in January, but losing 30k can be considered to be significant for emotional purposes, in this case, it had lost its uptrend trendlines) and the S&P got hammered to the point of losing its uptrend trendlines (more important).

If they didn't bounce, there were likely going to be more issues. 

The S&P is back in its uptrend trendlines and if the Dow isn't, it's trying to get back in (it's back in the ""it's consolidation until proven not to be"" area though in my book)."

2021-06-24 10:47:18,stocks,"Who knows. My main point of contention with people saying stocks are overvalued is value is entirely dictated by the market. There are many companies in the same industry performing at virtually the same level, with wildly different price points. So I don‚Äôt necessarily subscribe to the idea that the entire market is ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù. Retail has managed to keep a stock at like 20x it‚Äôs ‚Äúactual‚Äù valuation for 6 months. Even big firms are indicating they just have no way to read the market anymore. 

For the current generation of investors I think future sentiment, forward thinking, and longevity beats out everything.

Diversification is great but don‚Äôt force it - have conviction and a reason in the companies you invest in if you‚Äôre a long term investor."
2021-06-24 10:29:58,stocks,I am in the same boat. I think it is fine if you are a long investor but if you're a trader it's definitely stressful keeping track of all of them each day. I also agree with the comment below -- I am going to focus on this once some of my positions break even -- focus on 5-7 strong convictions and keep adding rather than looking at entering into new positions.
2021-06-24 10:48:57,stocks,"I do and I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm at about 23 or something. What I care is the returns. How are they performing? I keep track of that. One is underperforming, I usually wait about half a year, there‚Äôs no new product on the horizon, no major companies news, or the sector is stagnant, I sell. I like to reinvest in companies I already own. But I don‚Äôt want to limit myself with how many shares I own. There‚Äôs so many amazing companies in so many sectors. Like Ulta. I don‚Äôt know a thing about makeup. I‚Äôm a bald man, so I have no business stepping inside one of their stores, yet it‚Äôs been a good investment so far. So I don‚Äôt set any rules in stone."

That 94 net promoter score and its brand equity are elite. Peloton is the strongest brand to come along in the last decade.

Invest in companies that are absolutely *elite* in one or a few areas.

For example, Shopify has *elite* management, Bilibili has *elite* customer engagement (in same tier as Netflix/Amazon/Zoom in terms of minutes per day), Zoom has *elite* customer engagement, *elite* customer acquisition costs, and *elite* net dollar retention rates. They're the MVP of *elite* advanced company metrics."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Visa to buy Swedish fintech Tink for $2.2 billion Visa Inc said on Thursday it had agreed a 1.8 billion euro ($2.2 billion) takeover of European open banking platform Tink, months after it ditched a planned acquisition of the startup's U.S. rival Plaid.

Founded in 2012, Sweden-based Tink enables banks and other financial firms to access consumer financial data more easily. It is used by more than 3,400 banks and other institutions, as well as over 250 million customers across Europe.

Visa was forced to terminate a planned $5.3 billion deal with U.S. data-sharing platform Plaid in January, following a U.S. government lawsuit aimed at blocking the deal on antitrust grounds.

Visa said the Tink deal was subject to regulatory approvals.

European Union rules on open banking, also adopted by Britain before it left the bloc, require banks to allow access to customer data by registered third party providers to boost competition.

The rollout of the rules has provided fertile ground for fintechs, such as Tink, which provide technology to help third parties and banks to access customer data.

Visa would retain Tink's brand and management team, and its headquarters would stay in Stockholm, the company said.

The Tink takeover included cash and retention incentives, Visa said, adding the deal would have no impact on its previously announced stock buyback or dividend policy.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"AMD - A Diamond in the Rough I‚Äôm struggling to see how such a solid technology company can be trading at less than 9x Price/Sales. 

I mean, even apart from Lisa Su‚Äôs objective awesomeness as an Executive, consistently strong Revenue Growth and Earnings beats, this damn company is promising. Quarter after quarter it‚Äôs eating away at Intel‚Äôs market share, product users are continually impressed, and massive players like Tesla and Google are confident enough to back it. Even AMD wants to buy back it‚Äôs own shares at this price.

And what? Waiting for the XLNX deal has removed the entire speculative aspect of the stock market? A chip shortage, in part, due to an increase in CONSUMER DEMAND during the pandemic? Am I missing something here?

They continuously price their products relative to Intel's based on performance. So having a better product doesnt change this. Furthermore, having a better product does not make a company more profitable. This is one of the biggest logical fallacies I keep seeing in AMD discussions. You can have an inferior product line and still be more profitable than your competitors because you are more efficient, better marketing, etc, etc. The main reason to be bullish on AMD is their steady pace in gaining market share. Also, hopefully FSR will become mainstream and improved on because they desperately need some form of competition against DLSS once shortages level off in the next few years. There is no reason to buy a Radeon when its priced on par with Nvidia in terms of raw performance when Nvidia's cards have superior RTX and a fully functional way of upscaling. Not to mention all the other extras such as noise cancelling, etc. Its similar to comparing two Honda civics for the same price but one is fully loaded and the other is a base model.

I'd advise you to look more into AMD and TSMC's roadmaps as well as Intel's history of delays since 2015. The world has changed and if you're investing based on old assumptions you're going to get hurt."

What you‚Äôre saying is absolutely true - AMD has major manufacturing issues which they cannot even begin to address due to the same shortage worldwide.

AMD had a nice run for a short blip on its history, and they have some great products, but currently it‚Äôs trading at 115B market cap and generated 8B in revenue last year. When you compare that to Intel, who‚Äôs had a ‚Äúbad run‚Äù over the last few years, with a market cap of 230B generating nearly 100B in revenue, it‚Äôs simply not even a fair comparison.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Doximity IPO prices at $26 (above initial range of $20 - $23 a share) (Crossposted and slightly modified due to audience, from r/residents as DOCS was being offered to physicians)

I'm a new here but since I see some posts about it, might as well start with this.

I'm a physician in California, 20 years out from residency.

I've been investing with my Stafford Loan $ since MS I and endured several serious market crashes. I enjoy doing financial analysis and have successfully invested in multiple IPOs in the past, including google, mastercard, visa, interactive brokers, and evercore financial. I still HODL GOOG, MA, and V; sold EVR at a modest profit and roughly broke even on IBKR.

This is completely divorced from what I think about the app or the company (I don't like the fax function, don't usually read its articles, and primarily use it so that when I call patients they can't see my mobile #), I am focusing purely on the financials reported by the company. I would be interested in seeing if anyone else has picked up anything that I have blind spots for and cannot see. Thanks in advance.

**tl;dr**: DOCS hits every thing I want to see in (any) company going public. I committed a full 250 share allotment on Fidelity after I had passed on an opportunity to purchase pre-IPO shares through EquityZen

**First.** The [S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001516513/000162828021011269/doximity-sx1.htm) filing is located here.

**Second,** Their financials. For any company you want to look at:

* Revenue (also called 'top line')
* Operating Expenses
* Profit (also called 'bottom line') which is more or less revenue - expenses
* Cash on hand
* Debt
* Why they are going IPO

You want to see that the company is making money both top line and bottom line, you want to see that their costs are not outstripping their revenue and profit growth. **When you are investing in a stock, you are basically laying an (educated) bet that the company will grow their profits. When they grow, your stock grows.**

For the last bullet, you want to see that they have money so that they won't go bankrupt. Generally for why IPO, if the prospectus says, ""to pay back debt"" or ""the company will not receive any proceeds"" then stay the hell away. You want the company to use the money they raise to fund new ventures or anything that will help them grow.

So, under the hood (and very simplified):

&#x200B;

||2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|85.7mm|116.4mm (+30.7%)|206.9mm (+78%)|
|Expenses|67.9mm|79.3mm (+16.8%)|122.4mm (+54.3%)|
|Profit|7.8mm|23.5mm (+201%)|57.7mm (+145%)|

What do we see:

* Increasing rate of change growth in revenue from 2019 -> 2020, and 2020 -> 2021
* Increasing expenses but rate of change is not as much as rate of change of revenues
* Profit every year. Though 2020 - 2021 growth is not as much as 2019 - 2020, it's still more than doubled

DOCS has 142mm in cash on hand, and the only ""debt"" they have is in the form of convertible preferred stock - i.e. no loans taken out.

Why are they IPOing? They are going to use the funds to support growth and investments in the business, or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets.

**In Summary**.

Solely from a financial perspective, the company grows revenues and profits year over year. Their expenses are growing but not as rapidly - plus if you dive into their S-1 they have a significant portion of those expenses used for research and development, which in my mind is actually not an expense but more of an investment in their future. They have cash on hand and no debt. It's a slam dunk and I am not surprised that the IPO priced 3 dollars above their upper range because everyone with financial know how and the ability to get their hands on the stock wanted it.

Cheers and best wishes.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Maxar Technologies (MAXR) is an undervalued space stock Hi all,

I‚Äôve spent the past month learning what I can about the space industry and the companies involved.¬† **Long story short** ‚Äì Maxar Technologies (MAXR) is the best buy in aerospace right now. 

Maxar is the market leader in both satellite imagery and satellite development for space exploration.¬† Here is an overview:

* Maxar has built over 285 different satellites over the years, for various commercial and government customers or for their own constellations.
* Maxar is a frequent contractor for NASA and is the industry leader in robotic arms and electric propulsion technology.
* For the upcoming Moon mission, Maxar is contracted to build the propulsion and communication module ‚Äì a large and critical part of the spacecraft.¬†
* Maxar provides 90% of the geospatial intelligence used by the U.S. military
* 3.8 billion people use Maxar imagery every day ‚Äì through online maps like Google Maps and through telecommunications companies
* Maxar will be critical to innovation globally going forward ‚Äì every industry and government will increase their use of geospatial technology and Maxar will be the principal company they rely on.¬†

With a market cap of only $2.8 billion (plus 1.5% insider ownership), Maxar is highly undervalued.¬† Wall Street analysts give the stock a price target of $52-$60 which would be a 37% gain from where it is now.¬† I think it is worth a lot more, although I am no expert.

There is a $25 billion pipeline of aerospace contracts over the next five years (a figure being cited by multiple aerospace companies) and Maxar will be in a great position to capitalize on the growing opportunities. ¬†As the market continues to grow, Maxar will become an increasingly bigger player going forward.¬†

Stock history:

The stock started trading in 2004 at around $20/share.¬† It peaked from 2014-2015 at $80/share.¬† Then it crashed from 2016-2018 - hitting a low of $5/share - because of concerns over the amount of debt the company was holding.¬† Since then, Maxar sold off a portion of the company to a Canadian subsidiary and balanced their budget.¬† Since 2019 the stock has shown solid growth, now sitting at around $40.¬†FYI: For some reason the Fidelity and Robinhood charts only show the stock history since 2017.¬† Look on Google for the full chart since 2004."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"How to invest in the future of water I've been looking at these ETFs: 

*  FIW PHO CWW CGW PIO EBLU (in order of preference)

I just put them all into Trading View Charts and noticed FIW doing the best and EBLU the worst. I also used other compare tools, and noticed the same pattern again. FIW always coming out on top and EBLU at the bottom. I noticed PHO had better fundamentals than FIW even though FIW was always the top line in the performance chart? 

FIW seems more international while PHO is mostly USA, so I will probably have to discount PHO, as I want more international exposure in this sub-industry! 

CWW is based in Canada and pays quarterly dividends. 

So far, I'm leaning toward FIW. Or Maybe CWW (as I am in Canada). 

Is there something else I can try to get a more concentre understanding of how to compare ETFs effectively?

EDIT: I'm more interested in water conservation and clean water technologies of the future. As well as water as a form renewable energy. The key phrase is ""future of water"". I don't really want the ETF for its municipal exposure. But because I don't know which stocks are which, I consider the ETF approach. Ideally, I'd like to know the tickers, and forget the ETF. But only companies that are innovative and tech-focused."

2021-06-23 21:54:11,stocks,"I am an engineer in the industrial water space.  I‚Äôve worked for GE (before before it was sold to Suez) and Evoqua (As Siemens and after it was divested as Evoqua).

There was a lot of consolidation in this space back in the early 2000s.  The innovators are all private companies but the better ones tend to be purchased by DuPont.  DuPont and Dow merged and then split with the Water Technologies going to DuPont.  They‚Äôre really best in class membranes.  UF, NF and RO.  They also have best in class resins.  They‚Äôve been making acquisitions for the past year under DuPont leadership but DuPont is a big company and not a direct play on water.  Regardless, I think highly of them.  

Evoqua (AQUA) is expensive and IMO over-valued at the moment.  I won‚Äôt get into that but it‚Äôs a raging buy below $20.  It tends to take some big swings because of management that has a habit of over-promising and under-delivering.  The most profitable division is industrial BUT that it‚Äôs 100% US and tied to cyclical trends in the industries they serve.  That said, they also do service contracts which helps buffer downturns.

I know the least abound Violia.  They were once part of Siemens/Evoqua but I never worked in that division.  They have more international (European) exposure than the others.

Personally, I‚Äôd research the market and buy individual stocks.  A lot of money will be spent on water infrastructure, but muni equipment is very commoditized with lots of companies competing for contracts.  The names I listed above have proprietary equipment/technologies.  That‚Äôs where I‚Äôd invest as scarcity will drive more expensive water treatment solution.  Same with wastewater‚Ä¶ regulations will only get tighter and  the newer technology will be adopted more broadly over time.

Hope this helps.  I currently work for a small start-up backed by a major holding company.  That‚Äôs where the real growth is BUT there‚Äôs no way for retail investors to invest.  That said, if there‚Äôs a decent technology it will be purchased by one of the names above as soon as the company turns a profit."

Thank you, are these tickers? Because I couldn't find them. Is Dupont (DD)?"
2021-06-24 00:14:25,stocks,"Not tickers.

UF = Ultrafiltration
NF = Nanofiltration
RO = Reverse Osmosis

DuPont (DD) manufactures all of those different types membranes.  They‚Äôre industry leaders in that regard.  These membranes the foundation of many advanced water treatment systems and they have to be replaced periodically (3-7 years depending on the application.). There are manufacturers in Asia that make them cheaper but performance is generally lower and lifecycle cost is generally higher.  Other companies manufacturing membranes at scale include Hydranautics, Torray, Tricep, Koch, Pentair and LG.  I‚Äôm sure there are more but DuPont is the 500-lb gorilla in the US.

These are all widely used in industrial applications and trickling into more and more muni.  As water becomes more scarce and refs more stringent; munis will have to adopt.   

Sorry but I‚Äôm a technical guy.  Can‚Äôt speak to a good entry point."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"DD: $WWR, WestWater Resources - Graphite (This goes into EV batteries, approx 70-200lbs per car) So I saw this $WWR ticker a while back, some scam shit $1.5 to $15 back to $5 classic p&d penny stock mining uranium or some shit.  Or so I thought.  Some 10 months later I saw $WWR again, this time I decided to have a look.  As it turns out, this is actually a real company, not some phony research project brought to the OTC's as a ""stock.  It's a small stock, but real.

The reason it had shot up $1.5 to $15 long ago was an executive order by the president to secure supply of things like graphite inside of the US.  Currently 0% of our graphite is produced in this country (we have literally no mining, production, or synthetic production here) and it was seen as a problem since it's important and a bunch comes from China.  Based on my DD, the stock went dormant since then as they were awaiting business moves.

Just yesterday they made a big announcement with the first U.S. graphite production facility, announced by the governor of Alabama to be in the great state of Alabama near what I understand to be the U.S.'s largest graphite deposit (owned by $WWR I believe).  The plant is not a MINE, the mine is coming later, these guys are buying the mined graphite (not ready for use at all in products) and bringing it up to usable purity, then they plan to bring the mine up to self-feed.

These people are the ONLY people inside the united states producing graphite.  Graphite is one of only 2 forms of carbon found in the earth's crust, the other being diamonds.  Synthetic graphite is possible but currently approx 50% more expensive (just released june 4th 3 weeks ago by white house review) and it's made from coke stockfeed from coal or some shit, but these people at $WWR are also approaching that angle which I like, they can work from mined graphite and also pivot to synthetic graphite if it becomes cheaper.  No one else in the U.S. can produce this stuff.  Anything from 70-200 lbs of graphite per typical car up to like 400 lbs for the new ford lightning.

There are a few other companies like NMG trying to produce graphite, they are all about similar size and nascent, caps in the 50-350m range, WWR is at 170m.  $WWR is the only US, major exchange listed (NYSE) company and tbh it seems more stable and legit where as the other ones seem like hedge fund backed yolos that just shut down in 9 months, this company had actually existed.

Battery production is going to grow in the US especially with Biden's whole $170B EV plan where he plans to make the US the EV leader, I think this shit is really important.  $WWR just happens to be the right company at the right time, getting lucky and benefitting from world events and developments of the economy.  I think this really could be a gem.

The stock's lifetime value graph is classic small company goes bankrupt after a while, similar to all the biotech stocks before corona, or like PLUG, or like WKHS, there are many.  It's a concern of course but again I think right time, these $WWR guys are just lucky, as the other names i listed were, and can rebound successfully off of the $1.5 range, still only approx $5.50 range, having seen $15, and push towards $30-40 as the other names have."
2021-06-23 21:31:14,stocks,"Here is what I wrote the last time WWR came up:

This is 100% a scam company.

They have not brought a product to market in over 10 years.

They do not plan to bring a product to market until 2023 (if everything goes well). This would be using other mines graphite.

They do not plan to start mining operations until 2028 at a site that was surveyed by another company in 2016 and sold for pennies on the dollar.

I‚Äôm hoping this thing pumps up. I‚Äôll be waiting with puts in hand when it does."

2021-06-23 21:42:55,stocks,"hm im not sure its a scam, again these small companies, this was like a $20M cap company before, often go dormant and trade sideways for 10 years, it was a small mining company run by people trying to explore different areas uranium, graphite, vanadium, etc. they were just normal people trying to make a business work which is hard.  These people no doubt have no business not being in bankruptcy but again outside factors can save them, right place at the right time and it seems thats exactly whats happening.  Suddenly the US has to secure supply chains, they dumped the uranium business off on another company, selling it for cash i heard because it was just too costly and this company was too small so they sold the site, they couldn't get at it cost effectively because its an old site that's harder to mine now.  Now, IT STILL MIGHT FAIL, im not trying to lead anyone on.  But now they went full graphite and have VERY quickly turned around and the company is starting to look feasible for success.   They are buying graphite because it's approx $1500 per ton in raw form which is useless, it needs refined to battery grade which is a big process, that sells for approx $7500 a ton.  They are not focusing on the mining aspect because that's not as necessary."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"I bought my first stock (PLUG) today at age 31. I have been looking at stock trends without buying for a few months, and I‚Äôve noticed some trends.

The trend that stood out to me most was what I think of as a ‚Äúscoop‚Äù. This is probably very elementary stuff, and I‚Äôm sure there are technical terms that I am unaware of.

When I say scoop, I mean a stock that ramped up at some point then quickly dropped back down. After that, stocks seem to stay low and keep dropping but at a slower and slower rate. Eventually it evens out and starts to climb back up, usually to about 75% of its previous peak.

So my goal has been to find stocks that just finished leveling out and are starting to ‚Äúscoop‚Äù back up to that 75%.

I have been viewing this trend in 3m, 6m, 1yr, and 5yr ranges because I don‚Äôt have an interest in day trading, and I prefer a slower, safer climb.

So I have a few questions:

1. Is this a decent approach?

2. Does it have a name?

3. Are there other good companies out there showing a similar mid-to-long-term trends that I should look into?

Of course, I‚Äôm not asking for or giving financial advice. Thanks!"

2021-06-23 22:25:03,stocks,"when i first started investing i would only jump into stocks i thought i'd be holding 10 years later. so the scoop theory provides a good ""entry point,"" but in the long term doesn't necessarily matter - granted it's nice to get a good entry.

one thing to consider is short term vs. long term capital gains. you can make money swing trading or holding under a year, but the taxes (in the US at least) are much less severe if you hold 1 year or more.

Identify good entry points, from your original comment, based on two methods:

1. Elliot Waves
2. Ichimokou Cloud

Independent of a stonk‚Äôs virtues, Elliot Waves are psychology based.

And Ichi Cloud entry points are metric based. Trailing stop losses after entry have the potential to let you ride gains high and put on the breaks as needed to take profits or stop losses.

I dig this YouTube video about Ichimoku Clouds, you may find it technical and boring which I did the first three months I was trading then came around to it so no rush:

You need to give yourself a solid basis in what makes a company a good investment rather than looking for trading patterns. You can move on to technical analysis later after you can spot which companies are good investments and which are just being pumped and dumped.

2021-06-24 03:42:12,stocks,"The valuation of plug i still too high i think, so it would take a lot of years for the stock to reach a shareprice that is 75% higher than its current peak."
2021-06-24 07:37:45,stocks,"As for me this company is not on my list of investment, the revenue since many years including the last quarter 2021 is almost a joke to compare to the Market Cap. I really hope for you this company will finally find the way to real restart to sell something!"

2021-06-23 21:32:21,stocks,"Instead of chart patterns look at fundamentals. If the company has a P/E ratio of 125 or higher, buy as much as you can get a loan for üòÖ"
2021-06-24 03:21:26,stocks,Happened to me. Got a recommendation from a friend the day it happened to be pumping. Lesson learned.
2021-06-24 06:09:53,stocks,"Agree with this response 100%, but PLUG is actually a fine buy IMHO if you're long.  

Its a volatile market full of pump n dump action, so know what you're buying and why."
2021-06-23 22:47:43,stocks,"Thanks for the caution! Since I‚Äôm looking into long-term trends of this type (and admittedly PLUG is a lot shorter-term than I had hoped), I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic that I shouldn‚Äôt run into that issue.

But if I do, it‚Äôll be a great learning experience."
2021-06-23 20:49:37,stocks,Thanks! I‚Äôll do some research on that terminology

2021-06-23 22:03:50,stocks,Thanks for the research material!
2021-06-24 13:29:49,stocks,"Yup this is really basic Wyckoff, vaguely similar to my own strategy"
2021-06-23 22:48:42,stocks,I see! Thanks for the insight. I‚Äôll see how it goes
2021-06-23 22:38:31,stocks,"Thank you for that advice! Yeah, I‚Äôm concerned about taxes.

Say I put in $10,000 in a year, and by the end of the year lets say I‚Äôve quit with stocks and pulled out all my money at $13,000. I‚Äôm wondering if I get taxed on the $13,000 or the $3,000... I have no idea what to expect.

I will be diversifying and I‚Äôm aiming to have a few 3mo, a few 6mo, a few 1yr, and a few 5yr stocks. Just wanted to start off using my speculations."
2021-06-23 22:07:30,stocks,"Thanks!

I didn‚Äôt even check 5 days or less. My comparison is from January 4th, 2021 until today. The pattern looks promising to me, and at least I support the idea they are going for... but you are right they seem to have their flaws.

I‚Äôll see how it goes! I have some faith in them for now"

2021-06-24 07:29:51,stocks,Oh no. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a somewhat common experience though
2021-06-24 09:12:58,stocks,"Yo, amazing comment! I‚Äôll be sure to do research into these methods and check out the vid you shared"
2021-06-23 20:52:48,stocks,"I‚Äôm aware they are a shitshow haha. I didn‚Äôt put too much money in them, I just couldn‚Äôt find another company at the start of a scoop ‚Äî or in the trend I was looking for.

I kind of think they could get their stuff together though, and if they do, I think it‚Äôd be very promising."
2021-06-23 23:11:29,stocks,100 percent it's an absolute disaster

2021-06-23 21:48:05,stocks,"Bag holding is not letting go of a stock even when it‚Äôs starting to decline (or is sure to decline), right?

I will not be holding if I believe it‚Äôs going down."
2021-06-23 23:12:51,stocks,100 percent agreed
2021-06-23 21:46:47,stocks,Nobody told me. I just browsed through about 50 stocks looking for a pattern and this matched what I was looking for.
2021-06-24 07:25:51,stocks,"Haha awesome! The stock moves pretty slowly, so it feels like a comfortable choice for starting out"
2021-06-23 22:43:34,stocks,"So many mixed responses about PLUG it seems. Some people really hate them, and others have made bank off of it.

For me, it‚Äôs just a test. I mean, it‚Äôs not like I put my whole life‚Äôs savings into it. Just some side cash, and I‚Äôll see how it goes. It looks like it has a promising few months."
2021-06-23 21:16:00,stocks,"Sweet! It‚Äôs nice to hear about others in the same stock. I do think if they can organize themselves a bit better, they could really do well. For now though, it looks like a steady climb for at least a month or two (from my completely noobish perspective).

New or not, the speculation around stocks is really enticing."
2021-06-23 22:10:03,stocks,Who would you recommend that I check out next?
2021-06-24 07:50:08,stocks,Thanks for sharing. I could imagine myself going in on Microsoft down the road
2021-06-24 17:24:26,stocks,"Yeah, I‚Äôd be fine with it plummeting. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt, but if it does I wont really be phased. $33 is where I‚Äôm holding. I‚Äôll hold it unless it drops below $20"
2021-06-24 19:06:50,stocks,"Thanks! Nah, I‚Äôm not planning to hold PLUG for years. I was aiming for 2-3 months, or until it drops to $20. It‚Äôs just for fun and just a test.

But I do agree learning more fundamentals would be useful, so thank you!"
2021-06-24 19:13:50,stocks,"Sounds like a good time, count me in!"
2021-06-24 19:18:31,stocks,"Totally comfortable losing 100% of the money I put into stock, if I wasn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd not put it in. I‚Äôm playing it safe with my personal finances. This is just side cash"
2021-06-24 19:19:42,stocks,"Thank you! If you‚Äôre into organic companies, I‚Äôm definitely going to put some money there as well."
2021-06-24 19:22:25,stocks,"It‚Äôs totally possible. I think that method is a bit different, from what I have searched, but kind of similar I suppose"
2021-06-24 19:23:13,stocks,"I think many people in this post did, so no worries! Haha. Goodluck :)"
2021-06-23 22:41:51,stocks,"Well, I couldn‚Äôt answer that for any stock.

I‚Äôm giving it a try though, so if I lose money I‚Äôll have something new to learn, which is a great thing. I expect to earn money though. Either way, I‚Äôll leave with more money or more knowledge and I‚Äôm fine with that."
2021-06-23 20:50:24,stocks,"Thank you! I‚Äôm somewhat nervous I‚Äôll make a rookie mistake haha, but I think I can be good at this..."

2021-06-23 22:49:55,stocks,Nice! How‚Äôs it been going for you?
2021-06-24 07:29:23,stocks,"I‚Äôve done paper trading already, and it‚Äôs been working out. I‚Äôll never put in more money than I can comfortably lose, so for now I‚Äôm just throwing money in to get started and get experience. If I lose all the money I put in, I won‚Äôt really care. I‚Äôll just learn from it.

I‚Äôll probably test paper trading on some risky choices down the road as well"
2021-06-24 08:33:43,stocks,I plan to do research more research. I just figured I‚Äôd also get started investing as well. Thanks for the suggestions!
2021-06-24 08:48:40,stocks,You‚Äôre probably more right than I am. We‚Äôll see how it goes!
2021-06-24 08:47:25,stocks,Yes. I‚Äôm investing in butt plugs.
2021-06-24 19:09:59,stocks,Interesting. Do you know why they dropped from $200+ to nearly 0 for years? It does look like it might have potential.
2021-06-23 21:40:10,stocks,"Please tell me your joking, p/e above 125 is kind of crazy. Also margin loans are bad idea for almost anyone."
2021-06-24 12:03:22,stocks,"I don‚Äôt know. It has ran up so much since beginning of 2020 based mostly on the EV craze. Not to mention after their revised 2020 financial statements they reported net loss of $93M and -$1.69/share.

This company is still overpriced."
2021-06-24 09:00:24,stocks,PLUG is a good investment if you believe in renewable energy. Definitely a long hold but renewables are the future.
2021-06-24 02:54:19,stocks,"So you think PLUG price will increase roughly 65% from now, to reach 3/4 of its January‚Äôs peak?"
2021-06-23 22:44:43,stocks,Learn what a cup with handle really is and stick to those stocks.  Leave your scoops for ice cream.
2021-06-24 04:11:37,stocks,"You‚Äôd pay taxes only on the realized gains, minus any losses. A realized gain is one where the position has been closed.  (You sold the stock)

If you have a net loss you report it.  The tax deduction can be rolled forward to offset future gains. 

Your strategy is actually pretty decent for long term investing. The idea to to buy into a good trend early. 

I would suggest diversifying both across stocks and industries. ETFs can help with this if you don‚Äôt want to open many positions. 

Often a sector will rise or fall together. Earlier this year growth dropped while value rose. 

This will water down your winnings, but also reduce your losses."
2021-06-23 22:53:59,stocks,"you are taxed on the gains ($3k in your example) and the rate varies by tax bracket. def do some general research üëç

edited out some shitty info"
2021-06-24 07:38:31,stocks,"All data regarding this trend is heavily skewed by the end of january to february runup in so many speculative stocks that wasn't justified by any fundamentals but rather by hype hype and more hype. If you want to be someone trading on the expectation of hype that's completely fine but be prepared to underperform and be left holding the bag. 
Just a small list of stocks that had huge peaks in January to February that I don't see getting to that level anytime soon:

OPEN, PLUG, SSYS, FUBO, B N GO (apparently I can't post this ticker lol) and then there is plenty of memestock fueled runups like BB, TLRY, SNDL and hell even AMC & GME that are what you can consider unsustainable runups.

I prefer investing in fundamentals. That doesn't mean that you can't hold any speculative stocks in your portfolio (I mean I had some BB at 8 dollars which I sold at 18 since I figured a runup on no news of like 125 percent in 4 days was a good point to take profits). 

The problem with the whole scoop strategy is you just look at a pattern rather than the company itself. Personally I think from a fundamental standpoint PLUG is an absolutely garbage company that isn't going to give you any ROI based on fundamentals anytime soon. That's why I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole."
2021-06-24 19:34:54,stocks,Sorry I missed the Casino part
2021-06-23 21:24:24,stocks,"A lot of solar stocks are in that same formation (and have better financials and leadership). they're recovering from a pretty steep bubble that built up and burst from the end of 2020-early 2021

A couple of my favorites are $SPWR and $MAXN. These are just off the top of my head because I own them but there are others. Hell, even renewable etfs like $ICLN are in a similar trend."
2021-06-23 21:52:16,stocks,"Yeah you'd be surprised how people  rationalize a losing position, plug just sets off too many red flags to me I wouldn't touch it personally"
2021-06-24 03:01:17,stocks,">	I will not be holding if I believe it‚Äôs going down.

‚ÄúBelieving‚Äù will easily make you a bag holder, if you watch it drop but don‚Äôt sell because the past patterns tell you it will rocket any moment now!

So could any large gap down, which are always a possible surprise with these speculative stocks.

Here is a scenario: one day it opens 10% down for no reason, putting you in the red, the chart tells you it will recover, what will you do?"
2021-06-23 23:59:34,stocks,Blackberry!!
2021-06-23 21:55:53,stocks,"Plug is a terrible company/stock. Sure you may get lucky a few times, but as a new investor; looking for stocks that skyrocket up (hype / meme) and then crashing back down is not really something you want to be apart of. IMO, like I said you may hit a couple but you‚Äôll likely lose more then you make. You‚Äôre better off investing in good fundamentals and more stable companies. Slow and steady wins this long term race."
2021-06-24 01:25:15,stocks,Did you look into WHY that stock went down?  Some shady shit coming from Plug.
2021-06-23 22:56:34,stocks,"No worries i just despise this company because i know how many poor retail investors will hold the bag with this one ,did you also considered to buy some index funds ?"
2021-06-23 23:24:24,stocks,">others have made bank

Made, not making. Past tense"
2021-06-23 23:04:20,stocks,What makes you think they can organize themselves and become profitable? Why did you invest in the company? Aside from the chart going up then down.
2021-06-23 21:27:55,stocks,"Just for further comparison, read up FCEL and BE. Seems like every time I hear about PLUG, FCEL is the rival, and BE gets a mention is in that mix as well."
2021-06-23 23:10:48,stocks,">FCX!!! Green revolution needs electricity, electricity needs copper."
2021-06-23 22:53:15,stocks,"Well, there are fundamentals to back up every security you buy. Or there should be, in theory. You're paying for the company's future returns as a business.

Here is the finviz page for AAPL: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl&ty=c&ta=0&p=w

It lays out a bunch of metrics. Read up on those and what they mean. Also read up on what exactly the company does and the industry it's in. 

I talk about a bunch of tickers in my post history that I think are winners going forward. They all have in common excellent fundamentals -- mainly growth. Is PLUG a good growth stock? I don't know. Hydrogen is a hard subject to wrap your head around. 

Look at STEM if you want a renewable energy stock that's similarly a bit speculative but with a more proven product and business."
2021-06-23 22:10:03,stocks,That's what everyone says before they know what's going on! ;)
2021-06-23 22:12:01,stocks,Time in the market beats timing the market a nice approach really almost the same as mine. I usually buy 10 of a stock I want to watch and study find the lows and highs of about 3 months find all the dips and peaks in my mind then when one hits a marker I'm comfortable with go pretty deep in it normally takes off. Can't go wrong with plug ino I have made a killing off them thus past yr
2021-06-23 23:10:43,stocks,"Meh... mixed feelings. Mostly doing well, some went up 15-20% since January when I started (and I regret not putting more in them - I believed in them but was/am new to the systems and didn't want to learn with high values). Some went down even 50% but I knew that could happen (it was really a bet) and put very little in them. Most of my money is still in fixed interest (again, still learning). So in the end, despite some good returns the total return is still low. But I'd rather earn little than lose a lot because of a beginner's mistake. 
   
If what I calculated yesterday is correct, i earned less than what I would had i just left it all in fixed interest (that wasn't the plan). But on the other hand I've been learning an awful lot, and in the long run I should be fine. I'm really happy that at the start of 2020 I took the step to learn things. It's not easy, there are plenty of traps, but I'm glad I learned so much since then. 
  
Currently thinking of next moves but also figuring out my spreadsheet to get everything organized and correctly calculate actual earnings, especially considering taxes and stuff. I really need to get control of my numbers to get a correct understanding of where I actually am. And selecting the right moves takes time (which TBH i don't have much of right now).
  
For context, I live in Brazil so there's inflation, taxes, politics and currency exchange. I've began investing in the US as well but the currency exchange and transfer taxes can be a bit tricky. USDBRL went down some 10% but I've been doing DCA and expectations are that it will up and beyond in the next year or so. 
  
I wasn't planning to write such a long  (and convoluted) response, but it's kind of complex."
2021-06-24 09:20:21,stocks,"Haha yeah it wouldn‚Äôt be my pick atm, although i like the potential that hydrogen has as an energy fuel. But those hydrogen stocks have skyrocketed so much back in march, that the valuations became absolutely absurd. Guess you can say they have dropped a significant amount, but i still think there is more to come."
2021-06-24 19:14:28,stocks,They didn‚Äôt have the projects up and running and share dilution in the past .. now things are ready to go
2021-06-23 22:02:40,stocks,"I like my patterns, so I‚Äôm sticking to my strat anyway. But what‚Äôs p/e?"
2021-06-24 16:27:51,stocks,Plug is also the king of diluting shareholder equity. And I don't know if it's them or FCEL but they sell their product at a loss.
2021-06-24 17:33:21,stocks,I like the way you think
2021-06-24 08:38:19,stocks,"I think that around the middle of August, PLUG will be about $50. I fully accept that I could be wrong :)"
2021-06-23 22:49:33,stocks,"Yes, sir!"
2021-06-24 11:19:12,stocks,"Awesome advice! Thank you, and thank you for the clear definition of a ‚Äúrealized gain‚Äù. I‚Äôve learned quite a bit in the last 24 hours.

I will definitely be diversifying in stocks and markets. Probably buying my second stock today.

I plan to also diversify by having short-term, mid-term, and long-term stocks. I‚Äôm not sure what an ETF is yet, but I don‚Äôt mind having lots of positions open. I‚Äôll still probably get into ETFs if it‚Äôs a slow, safer climb."
2021-06-24 08:19:11,stocks,"This isn‚Äôt true, u will make some and loose some, but at the end of the tax year you are only taxed on your total realized capital gains! Losers offset winners ect. And if you have a capital loss u can use it to offset your other taxable income??"
2021-06-24 17:31:17,stocks,"I definitely left out any details of the research I did (which admittedly wasn‚Äôt much, but probably more than people assume).

Thanks for that insight! I didn‚Äôt know PLUG had some hype behind it. A few random details and what I‚Äôm speculating could be a small, 2-3 month climb before dropping again.

Anyway, I seriously cannot learn well without doing something. I spent a good few months listening and reading people talk about technical analysis and none of it stuck because that‚Äôs just not how I learn. So I said screw it and got involved. I‚Äôve learned more in 24 hours than the previous rest of 2021."
2021-06-23 22:56:03,stocks,"I really like ARRY, too. Beat down like heck but very affordable growth story now."
2021-06-23 21:30:42,stocks,"SPWR is interesting but is solar really a great idea when oil is this hot?

Not that I'm jumping into oil lol, I just don't know what to make of energy stocks right now. I'm out of that."
2021-06-23 21:54:45,stocks,"This is perfect! Thank you. I‚Äôm going to stick to $PLUG for a while to see how it goes, but I‚Äôll be doing some DD on $SPWR. That‚Äôs basically a perfect target for me.

I‚Äôll likely invest in it by the end of the day and the continue my research.

I plan to buy lots of stocks in various fields that I trust. Keeping things diversified."
2021-06-23 23:36:35,stocks,I made a decent return on Plug a year or two ago. But i sold it at the right time. I agree though. There are a lot of weird things going on with them.
2021-06-23 22:08:14,stocks,Gotcha! What stocks would you recommend that I look into?
2021-06-24 08:40:21,stocks,I‚Äôd probably see how it goes. I wouldn‚Äôt take out an investment because of one bad day. If there was truly ‚Äúno reason‚Äù. In reality I‚Äôd do some research to see why it fell
2021-06-24 08:47:54,stocks,So everybody is pretty much telling you to set a stop loss and stick to it. We have all been there where we really believe in a stock and ignore our stop loss because we believe and then suddenly the stock is worthless.
2021-06-23 22:09:31,stocks,Which stocks would you recommend me checking out?
2021-06-24 08:31:48,stocks,"From what I understand, they had some reporting errors. Feel free to share if I‚Äôve missed something"
2021-06-24 06:59:37,stocks,"I‚Äôll have to do some research on the topic, because unfortunately I‚Äôm just now learning. But it sounds like a safe, longterm investment, so I will most likely get involved"
2021-06-24 07:26:37,stocks,I don‚Äôt really plan to make bank from it anyway. Just testing a theory and having fun with side cash
2021-06-23 22:01:44,stocks,"Wow that history on FCEL is insane. $7k for a single stock, down to $20. Goodness. Seems like good potential there if they started to trend up over several months.

Thanks for the info. I definitely like PLUG more from what I‚Äôm seeing, but this was still insightful!"
2021-06-24 07:19:44,stocks,Looks like a solid stock! I‚Äôm going to add it to my watch list and investigate the company. Thanks for the suggestion
2021-06-23 22:13:26,stocks,Awesome! I‚Äôm glad to hear that
2021-06-24 07:18:05,stocks,"Thanks for sharing. I agree with you that you should be happy you‚Äôre in the green overall. That‚Äôs probably not always the case for beginners.

What I‚Äôve learned in my one day of investing so far is to take what people on the internet say with a large dose of salt. There have been some really kind, helpful investors in this thread, and also toxic people who seem to be trying to get me involved with dying stocks. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs an advantage to that for them.

There may also be some genuinely good intentions behind what look like really horrible stock suggestions, but I‚Äôm going to follow my limited knowledge and learn by my faults and experiences.

Best of luck! And stay positive :)"
2021-06-23 23:22:48,stocks,Its appreciated
2021-06-24 19:25:28,stocks,I‚Äôll look more into the company and the details to see what‚Äôs up. Thanks for the suggestion!
2021-06-24 00:01:58,stocks,"You should really learn some of these things before or while you are investing if you truly value your money. You're putting a lot of faith in reading charts but even then you aren't reading a chart, you're just making up your own ""strategy"" using confirmation bias to only see the winners of the ""scoop"". Without learning how to find out if a company is valuable or profitable your chart reading is unreliable at best and useless at worst. 

I don't mean this to insult you, I only started investing this year and I was the most square one as square one could be when I started. I just can't imagine even at the beginning feeling so loose with my money that I would invest before learning the most basic basic things like P/E, market cap, short float, gross vs net, profit margins. Best of luck investing, investopedia and finviz are your friends. Webull also has a ton of information if you do your research on a mobile device like I often do."
2021-06-23 22:30:57,stocks,"Sure you do, my comment was more about p/e ratios comment above which is the ratio of the share price to earnings per share. In the above example, 152 p/e would be the share price would indicate that say the share price is 152 but the earnings per share is 1 dollar. It *can be* an indicator that a stock is overbought for what it really worth, but it's a little more complicated than that.  As a general rule of thumb, anything over 80 is a good indicator it's overbought, but you then need to look at the future pipeline and other fundamentals to assess if it's worth it. Take Amazon, for example, it trades at a fairly high p/e ratio but it is still considered a good buy because they reinvest their profits into r and d, to keep growing and expanding into new markets/areas.

In this case, you don't need to worry about that since PLUG has never had positive earnings per share."
2021-06-24 16:51:06,stocks,Oof. I didn‚Äôt even know about that. After their little financial shenanigans I sold everything and haven‚Äôt looked back. Three years of improper accounting/bookkeeping? No thanks.
2021-06-24 09:37:56,stocks,"The problem with these forums is that they mix people in vastly different situations, those who seek to gamble with relatively easily replaceable money, and those who manage their life savings.

You are aiming for a 50% upside in two months, but you could just as easily be down as much or more in the same time. Basically you are looking for a lottery ticket, and I assume you aren‚Äôt buying a very expensive one.

However it goes, it would be best to lose the gambling attitude before you oversee serious amounts of cash. It‚Äôs very easy to let a lucky gamble go to your head, take more big risks and ultimately lose everything."

2021-06-24 14:28:34,stocks,"Electronically Traded Fund. It‚Äôs a managed fund of stocks and assets. The manager has a set goal. 

The goal could be a theme like high growth.  Sometimes it‚Äôs meant to index a market or market segment. 

When you buy shares of an ETF you own a piece of the fund. The fund‚Äôs price is relative to but not controlled by, the assets it holds. 

There is a small management fee. 

The advantage is you get a piece of many stocks, and a manager to balance the portfolio. 

Let‚Äôs say you think 3D printing is going to be great, but you don‚Äôt know which companies are best. You could buy PRNT instead and let the manager choose."

However, my understanding of everything is increasing as well which is why I am also doing a lot better now than when I first started. Either way I can definitely recommend to read into some books there is plenty of knowledge out there that will actually improve your understanding of investing greatly. I also started looking into financial accounting recently which really helps when looking at balance sheets and helps you appropiately assess investments. There's so many aspects to properly assessing investments that it's really only something you should do if you actually plan on picking your own investments rather than throwing everything into an ETF. I've decided to have a balance between ETFs and indivodual picks of 60/40 as of right now and I plan to shift that towards individual picks as I learn more about this. I wish u luck with investing and hope you can attain the knowledge and sucess u desire. Cheers."

If the stock hits $20, I‚Äôll sell. If the stock goes up to $50 but then drops down to $40, I‚Äôll sell at least what I initially put in ($33/share). If the stock goes up to $100 over 5 years, Then trends back down to $80, I‚Äôll sell most but probably keep some in so that I‚Äôve made profit and don‚Äôt care what happens to the rest.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"The DOW is price weighted, should that mean that United health and other higher priced stocks potentially could split? So, I was doing some research on the Dow and how it functions. I know it is price weighted, therefore higher priced stocks have a greater impact on the Dow‚Äôs value than lower priced stocks. 

I began to look through the different companies within the Dow and came across UnitedHealth ($UNH). They are currently trading at $396 per share, which is far and above the rest of the pack. 

Goldman at 360 and Home Depot at 312.. after that it falls off to Microsoft at 265. 

So with UnitedHealth having such a heavy weight over everything else, what‚Äôs the chance we see some sort of stock split news out of them. They are trading around the same price of apple when they announced their stock split.

Love to have some opinions on the idea. Thanks."

2021-06-24 08:35:50,stocks,"Yes. If their price gets too high they will split because as you said, the Dow is price weighted. 

Tesla doing a 5:1 split earlier this year indicates that they‚Äôre aiming for Dow inclusion sometime in the future.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average currently has no automakers on it and the number of actual manufacturing companies has shrunk over the years, which is crazy for an ‚Äúindustrial‚Äù index."
2021-06-23 21:41:22,stocks,"I get that, but you‚Äôre not going to have a stock like amazon in the Dow at a price of 3500 where one fluctuation would shift the entire index.

My question is more towards the historicals of the Dow. Do companies that are in the Dow let their stock price run / does the Dow let their stock price run where they have a larger impact then. 

Is there an unwritten law that if you‚Äôre in the Dow you don‚Äôt let your stock have that much weight. 

If the answer to all that is no, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking."

Tellurian (TELL) is an LNG company looking to build a pipeline and export facility to sell natural gas from LNG wells they also own. TELL has enjoyed a nice run up the last month due in part to the signing of 2 contracts worth $24 Billion. 

This news from a press release Tuesday puts them in an excellent position  to stay competitive with other green energy companies.

As part of the design, Driftwood Pipeline is proposing to deploy Baker Hughes-supplied electric-driven compression, thereby reducing the pipeline‚Äôs carbon dioxide emissions by more than 99%. The proposed pipeline project, coupled with other strategic steps Tellurian is taking, will lead to nearly a one million tonne reduction per year in direct greenhouse gas emissions (a 14% overall reduction)."

Other than that, incredible deals already written and more on the way, love the management and Charif Souki is a legend in the LNG industry. Disclosure: I own a ton of shares, personally PT is 80 and I think it gets there in around 6-7 years, though I probably won‚Äôt sell it at that point due to possible buybacks/dividends and rising LNG prices."
2021-06-24 12:18:24,stocks,"High insider ownership with the best executive dream team in the industry. The likelihood of Driftwood happening is too good, making this an opportunity of a lifetime stock. 

The conviction and certainty of project approval mean you can continually invest in this baby over the next 5 years till Driftwood is complete with pre-determined share valuations. 

You can for sure pump into it till $40 but $80 is also on the table. Just look at Souki's first company, LNG. 

I like the commodity aspect too when there's fear of inflation. 

Plus signing countries in to multi-year contracts like they've been doing to keep the power running makes me feel safer than speculative tech. Risk is there but my first sentence gives me conviction this is happening as we bridge to renewables."

Definitely risk here, thats why it‚Äôs hanging in the $4 dollar range. I love PR that has  been coming out, and I am really optimistic that TELLs team will pull this off.

The government came and bailed these huge lenders with 190 billion dollars. In exchange they were to give 10% dividends annually as well as warrants to own 80% of the company. It is estimated that these companies have paid over 300 billion....paying the loan back and then some. The ownership is still mainly federal. Under the Trump Admin the idea was these were to go their own ways once again around the year 2024.

Today, in court there was a ruling that shareholders who wanted some of the dividends paid back was dismissed. Also, Biden has other plans for these 2.

My question is, these both are down nearly 50% last couple of weeks. Is it a good idea to buy small lots now? Wait it out? Or don't even touch it?

At this point, there is not much indication that the Biden admin has any intention of looking into a privatization structure for the GSEs. With that said, there is still a sliver of hope for potential upside but it really depends on what happens from here...

The SCOTUS decision today is going to give almost all of the leverage going forward back to the government and treasury (there are still claims in lower courts and SCOTUS did grant shareholders pursuit of constitutional claim, but I wouldn't hold my breath for much amounting from the other cases). The first domino to fall is going to be who will be the new FHFA Director. One name that popped up earlier was Susan Wachter. Why this is a little intriguing for shareholders is Wachter had previously supported moving the GSEs to a utility model which would be a semi-hybrid version of partially privatizing the companies but maintaining a level of government control. 

The idea of full privatization is likely a distant thought, if not forever gone. The amendments from the prior administration that outlined a path to full privatization are likely going to be unwound and the GSEs could potentially have their profits fully swept again and this administration is going to place a priority on using the GSEs as vehicles for affordable housing more than anything else.

I don't know if I'd label it ""doom and gloom"" yet because I don't think we really have a definitive yet on what this administration intends to do. People could be overreacting today to a scenario that doesn't turn out terrible for them or people would be holding shares that are literally worthless.

2021-06-24 12:10:37,stocks,Risk/opportunity was already priced into this for months awaiting the court decision.  The drop wasn't just a reaction to the court decision surprising people - it was those hoping for a quick buck from a favorable court decision seeing they lost that bet.  Those buyers and drivers of the past months volume/price aren't coming back.  It's anyone's guess where this government influenced wave pattern goes from here.  There's plenty of other good opportunities with far more upside and less risk than this.

Do we see a pull back during this time of uncertainty? FEDs are rocking the market, and some people are heading back into tech, but I think it‚Äôs temporary.

You're trying to day trade volatility.  That isn't something that people are known for getting rich doing.   If market sentiment stays strong on growth, they have a lot of room to run. May be that they level off and trade sideways before breaking one way or another too.  

Growth technicals are bullish AF right now with many 20 day MAs crossing over 50 days.  Doesn't mean they'll run forever, and that hyperbole shows a lack of understanding of the market, imo.

If you keep guessing that next week we'll see a pullback, you'll eventually be right.  Question is how much will you have missed out on (or lost if you're shorting) before then?"

2021-06-23 21:37:29,stocks,"You're looking at the wrong news, their news in the entire past year has been incredible. You're just biased against growth instead of even reading DD. 

Instead of defending Roku, because it's up to you to search this sub for some of the great DD, I'm going to counter that growth is running too hot. Growth got crushed for four months due to overspeculation of inflation fears (overblown for ten years and counting, btw). Growth has been running extra hot due to low Federal Interest Rates, but all the speculation was doubting what Powell has said over and over and over, that he would raise the rates extremely early. Now it sounds like they might raise a quarter early, and not a concern regardless. So their rise isn't based on news, it's based on the market finally accepting Powell's word and how oversold Roku was the past four months.

If you want to short Roku for like one day you might get lucky, because there will certainly be volatility, but Roku is absolutely going to hit a new All Time High this year. Unless you want to be the person who keeps doubting Powell, which never should have even happened in the first place."

2021-06-24 03:47:37,stocks,"VTI + VXUS will give you exposure to both US and international markets. It also allows you to decide how much exposure you want of US vs Int'l. 

Or you could go with just VT which is the entire world market in a single etf. Only downside is, unlike VTI + VXUS, you can't choose what % you want of US vs Int'l.

Outside of this, you don't really need anything else, though you can definitely supplement your portfolio with other ETFs/stocks if you believe in them and want to tilt your portfolio in the direction. VUG, for example, adds a growth tilt. I think a good thing to do is decide how you want to allocate your portfolio. In my opinion, it's best to have the majority of your funds in a total US market index fund, but I'm also a big believer in the Three-fund Portfolio.

Here's my personal portfolio breakdown:

60% - Total US market index fund

20% - Total Int'l market index fund

15% - Supplementary ETFs/Individual stocks

5% - Bonds

The others are very unlikely to be available to you if you are leaving. The 47 options will likely have a strike price (unless they are RSU‚Äôs) - this is the amount you have to pay to acquire the shares, worth doing if the current share price in the market exceeds that amount. There are various tax implications depending on the type of options and how long you hold, you will likely loose the right to buy them after a small period of time of leaving, and I‚Äôve assumed the company you work for is currently a publicly traded company so definitely check in with HR."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Is anyone buying right now at indices tops? Hello, I'm just wondering what sector or stocks people are buying right now that indexes are at ATH?

I'm still suffering from PTSD from March, Apr and May pull backs when I bought growth stocks near ATH and bought dips and ran out of dry powder when it became a 7 layer dip.

Now from the recent rallys I'm able to go mostly cash but I'm feeling the fomo when everyday is green. I know as soon as I buy the market will crash again, just like when I sold July 2 tqqq 100 CC end of May the market exploded lol.

2021-06-24 00:39:22,stocks,"I hear you. I could have written this post. I got ""burnt"" by the tech sell-offs. I've seen a post today by someone saying that the first trading experiences can be bad longterm if they are overwhelmingly positive because the investor/trader doesn't learn to manage risk/loss - and I get that, I do.

But the other side of the coin isn't much better. It can also be VERY difficult when you experience dramatic drops quickly and lose up to 25 percent of your own hard-earned capital in the first few months of investing. The job that allowed me to invest some extra funds into the market was very exhausting and seeing that money evaporating was very uncomfortable.

I did not sell anything during the worst tech dips. I even bought the dips that I could. To be clear, I did not buy highly speculative stocks. For example, I was a thousand dollars down on a company like Apple. (My Disney is still red, btw, because I bought them low a while ago, but also high in February.)

The consequences of all this for me have been that I sold some of my stocks as soon as they broke even, and now I'm looking at them 20-25 percent higher than they were. But I can accept that because in March I was dreaming of just getting out of those positions without a loss.

Another consequence of the bearish/sideways tech spring is that I am NOT buying now at all time highs during these massive rallies. I might lose out on many gains - I already AM losing - but these rallies scare me. I would be comfortable buying on a 10-20 percent dip, even though I'm aware it might not make sense financially or logically, and I might wait for it longer than I expect.

This is why paper trading (not that people shouldn't practice) doesn't fully prepare a person to trade/invest in my opinion. The pain of seeing your hard-earned paycheck dwindle every day and week or the joy of actually having a profit are the experiences that eventually - and hopefully - make us all better investors and traders (depending on our goals).

PS. I'm also not buying banks etc., but that's simply because I'm not knowledgeable about that sector. For that, I simply hold a High Dividend Fund on Vanguard, and it has all the bank, oil, and other stuff I wouldn't buy on my own. (To be clear, I hold this fund because its stocks fluctuate as well, not because it gives a dividend.)"

A gold company that has dropped quite a bit this last month and pays somewhat decent dividends

$ENB
An energy company with pretty high dividend payout.

$CGX
Hoping to grow with everything in Canada reopening.

Am I leaning towards the right direction? Or are there other companies I should look into?

Thanks for any advice!"

Why not just keep it in savings and add to it by working more hours or getting a side hustle? If you both work and try to make an extra $5k in a year you can have a pretty legit wedding for 10k, especially if you keep the guest count low (under 30) and find an affordable location/venu; dj with your iPhone, hire an inexpensive caterer (my bro did tacos it was awesome)."
2021-06-24 10:56:51,stocks,"1.5 years is a very shot time frame for single stocks. At 1.5 years remaining to my planned purchase I would've been looking for an exit point. Not an entry.

If you really really wanted to be risky biscuit then I'd go with 10% stock 25% etf and 65% high interest savings/gic. But chances are you won't make enough to cover commissions unless ibkr.

Your plan of 1000 a month means it turns into 988 or less if you're using the big brokers unless it's ibkr or wst That's like a 1.2% loss right away.

Some brokers give free etf buying and only commissions on selling so that would give you some advantage.

And finally what would you do if its 4 weeks before your wedding, deposits are due, and your portfolio is down 30% because someone announced an inflation of 12% (100% plausible by the way, happened in 1980) . Or maybe someone said there's a sth sth about your specific stock?

Again just imagine 15 months away you will need to make a withdrawal. You put in 20k total but you see the P/L and it says 5k unrealized loss. 25% down. If you withdraw you lose 5k AND screw up the limit on your tfsa permanently. Would you still have enough money for your wedding? Would you be willing to take the loss? If you would've taken the hisa you prob would be up a hundred bucks or so rather than down 5000.

On the other hand you might get lucky and get your 6%(average s&p gains over 10 years) or something like that  which would be around 800 bucks.

The decision to oust Calabria came after the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the housing agency should be more accountable to the Oval Office.

Background:

Roper Technologies has been growing for years.  They joined the Russell 1000 in 2004 and then the S&P 500 in 2009.

They keep buying up smaller companies and expanding their reach throughout a variety of market sectors.  


Sector: Industrials

Industry: Industrial Conglomerates



Stats:

Market Cap: $48.41 billion

P/E (12 mos): 48.78 (75th percentile in the industry)

P/E (5-yr avg): 30.27 (89th percentile in the industry)

EPS growth (year to year quarter compare): +19.74% (55th percentile in the industry)

Revenue % change (year to year quarter compare): +13.17% (85th percentile in the industry)

Free Cash Flow: $1.69 BILLION (62nd percentile in the industry)

Gross margin: 75.57% (Good Lord!... **100th percentile in the industry!**)

EBITD Margin: 36.17% (These are not typos... **100th percentile in the industry!**)

Profit Margin (last qtr): 18.91% (**100th percentile in the industry!**  Are you seeing a pattern here??)


Earnings:

They have consistently beaten earnings expectations... the last time they didn't was q2 2016! 



Analysis:

For analyst opinions, out of the 13 firms with opinions, here is the breakdown:

Outperform - 3

Buy - 3

Neutral - 6

Sell - 1




The vast majority of the stock is institutionally owned...

Shares outstanding:  105,239,000

Institutional ownership: 90.5%

Top owners?  T.Rowe Price, Vanguard, and Blackrock.  Combined these 3 own over 13 billion dollars worth of $ROP.



Volume is very low: 90-day average volume is only 516,949 and IV is relatively low.  If you like bollinger bands and TA, take a look at the past few months... Bullish.


I am going long with shares and LEAPS.


**TL;DR:**

$ROP is a growing company with great financial stats.


Cheers!

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"What if you invested in the Linkedin Top 10 Companies to work for each year? I looked into it For 5 years now (They skipped 2020/Covid) LinkedIn has produced a list of top companies to work for (called various things through the years).  I wanted to see what the (basic) results would be if one invested in the top ten companies.  However, not all of the companies are public or were at the time of the list.  So I skipped those and continued on the list till I had the top 10 public companies.  Also, the formatting is hard so I just included total results for each period and the total for all 5 periods.  I did not include dividends.  

This is not perfect, but just for fun.  I based the results on the begining and ending share price.  It's not weighted in any way, just percent gain (or loss) for each company during that period.  Same for SPY.

Disclaimer: Bought 100 shares at $2.25.

You needed to have the share by Thursday to get the special dividend and hold it until the merger is complete (which is Friday, I think). To receive a special dividend of whatever the price of Trch ""land"" is. It can be $1 or $5 per share but nobody knows. But today is Wednesday, why the dump? Because of the T-2 rule.

If I knew that they will dump so hard, i would have sold CC. But I was too greedy. Sigh.

You also receive another dividend if you held but there is no date for that yet."

But, I went in knowing that they said something to the effect of, we don't know the value of our holdings right now. Which I interpreted as we're worthless there's no oil here. 

I also assumed there would be a bunch of hype because of the special dividend. Basically pump and dump made by the CEO. 

Got in held for 2 days got out, made 15% I think. Honestly I would leave this one alone everything here screams stay away unless you try to play the pump and dump which already happened.. this company should not be a long term play..

Looks to me like the CEO is trying to milk as much out of it as he can before it all comes down. Probably start another company and try to do the same thing hopefully he finds oil this time.."

2021-06-24 06:29:24,stocks,"I‚Äôm talking real big picture here, like buy the S&P 500 and check your balance 1x every 6 months; but long story short what really matters is when 2yr treasuries are yielding more than 10yr treasuries. 

That basically means the bond market expects the Fed cut rates within two years... because of a recession.  That‚Äôs an inverted yield curve, which is basically the bond markets recession early warning system.  When that FRED chart goes below zero the curve is inverted; that has 100% of the time resulted in a recession .6-2yrs later.

When the yield curve is going up, it‚Äôs steepening... going down it‚Äôs flattening.  It‚Äôs currently steepening (taking a little break right now), which -big picture- indicates multiple years of economic growth in US economy.

If you look at the last curve cycle 2009-2019, clearly 10 years of economic growth, BUT there were a number of bumps along the way, as there will be this time.

2021-06-23 22:02:59,stocks,That's your job buddy
2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"People start talking about managing risk and dealing with emotion after they crushed. Please, don't make this mistake. In the beginning I shared one of the most dangerous bias of a young trader ‚Äì I came to make money, not to lose it. This is fundamentally wrong. I spoke with many folks about it and they all seemed to have this bias. In fact taking small losses does not equal to losing money. There‚Äôs no way you can become a profitable trader if you are not ready to be wrong anytime you make a bet.

The key is how fast you understand your emotional trap and find a system to stick to it as much as you can. Self control is like a muscle you‚Äôll develop it with time. It‚Äôs easier said than done. I continuously made errors on the market before I began to simply put stop loss and take profit. But this is simple enough to start. I followed recommendations from the traders I've found on this qooore app and set up everything without checking it try minute. This is good for beginners, before you start digging deeper into the books. I gradually changed my perspective and traded weeks after weeks sticking to the plan training my discipline. My personal book recommendations are: Beginner Trader Psychology Mastery Guidebook By Joseph Lira; The Psychology of Trading: Tools and Techniques for Minding the Market by Brett Steenbarger and Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets by Taleb

Now I took all guesswork out of my stock trading ‚Äì¬†I keep diversified portfolio and dollar-cost averaging is a strategy investing equal sum at a regular, predetermined intervals. My emotions are not attached with the real money trading.

I really hope this advice connects with some of you :)"
2021-06-23 21:17:16,stocks,"All true. I know not to sell a stock on a dip I believe in fundamentally. Still though, just yesterday I was hovering over the sell button after a 7% pullback on my number 1 pick. The thing had rallied 40% in a week, my cost basis is low, and my target exit hasn't been hit. Even with all that I was a click away from letting emotions get the best of me. 

All that doubt hits you hard in seconds when stock drops hard. Every stupid little comment on reddit comes to mind. What helped me was looking at the monthly chart instead of the day. I just had to zoom out to regain my composure. Seriously though, the worst thing you can do is assume you're immune to emotional trading. The more you can stay self aware, the better."
2021-06-23 20:33:20,stocks,"You HAVE to lose some money to be the most competent investor. Here's an example:

You own A but it's down $5 and will stay that way for 6 months

You see a trend in B and it's slated to go up $10 in the next 2 months

If you hold A you'll be losing $10. The correct move is to exit from A and move to B. So you have to accept the loss in your current position in order to get to a better one.

This is a simple example but it shows a couple of important maxims:

1. You have no power over the past or the future, only the present. Because you are making predictions, you are bound to be wrong a fair deal. In fact, it would be insane to expect to never make a wrong move, or catch bad luck, have the market fall underneath you, etc. All of these things should be naturally expected. If you stay in the game long enough you'll hit them all, and plenty.
2. What your money is doing RIGHT NOW should be judged against the other many things it could be doing RIGHT NOW. Not maybe 6 months from now while you wait for a loss to maybe rebound. 

So your job is to try to make the least amount of forced errors. Try to constantly get better at your predictions, knowing that without a crystal ball you are just a mortal like everyone else. And don't fall for emotions and stay in a losing position when your money could be doing something much better right now.

This is why you play in a landscape of reasonable investments. Because you are going to win some and lose some. But you can apply dedication, research and perseverance to beat the odds. So instead of winning 50% and losing 50% (random odds), maybe you win 60% and lose 40% thanks to your dedication. And that's enough to be successful long term, unless you are being stupid and YOLOing your way through life so that a couple bad moves tap you out.

This is why ""the house always wins"". Casino game odds are designed just a hair in favor of the house. If you played them steady and reasonable you couldn't lose much. They are betting on people going YOLO, making a couple bad moves in a row and gifting them their hard earned money. 

Remember that casino dynamic when you decide if you want to be a serious, organized, reasonable long term trader, or a YOLO type of creature.

Investing is not about trying to nail a couple of great moves in a row without taking any losses. Investing is about building a steady landscape for yourself, and beating the 50/50 odds just good enough to come out on top consistently and long term. Losing is part of the deal, as long as it happens less often than winning."

2021-06-23 22:02:15,stocks,">In the beginning I shared one of the most dangerous bias of a young trader ‚Äì I came to make money, not to lose it. This is fundamentally wrong. I spoke with many folks about it and they all seemed to have this bias. In fact taking small losses does not equal to losing money. There‚Äôs no way you can become a profitable trader if you are not ready to be wrong anytime you make a bet.

of course, that doesn't necessarily mean that anytime a stock goes down that  someone was wrong. when a stock goes down, someone needs to objectively look and say ""why did i buy this to begin with, and do i still believe this stock will end up going where i expected it to in the long term"".

look at all the people who were buying XOM for $40-$45/share last year, then watched it crater to around $30/share. those who still believed and held on have shares that are over $60 now. same can be said for moderna. i remember all the ""i'm down so much, i bought at $80 and now it's tanking"" posts last summer. 

there's a big difference between acknowledging that the analysis that lead someone to purchase a stock may have been flawed and selling for a loss versus simply seeing red and panicking, pulling the money out as a kneejerk reaction.

the most important question someone can ask themselves when they see red is ""has something changed from my initial analysis of the company"". i've definitely sold stuff where  the answer to that question was yes (for example when dave and busters was on the verge of bankruptcy, and that risk was WAY higher  than when i purchased, and the executives were putting out insane  ideas like some stupid radio station as a way to right the ship). ended up selling at break even, so fortunately not a loss, but easily could have been (and would have been if i waited a little longer to sell)"

- On technicals alone, it looks like $TSLA broke out of an intraday bull pennant at close. This happened after basing all day after the early market run up
- Bull pennant break is typically the distance of the flag pole from the breakout point 

So if you are playing the breakout:

- Entry: $656 (Today‚Äôs close)
- Stop loss: $647 (Pennant low. Likely signals a breakdown is underway)
- Target: $685 (length of the pole)

Upside: 4.4%

Now those numbers aren‚Äôt much, but $TSLA options trade with a significant premium. I‚Äôd also anticipate we‚Äôd make this move by the end of the week given the breakout. If I really felt good about this move, I could opt for weekly options vs. stock, adhering to my levels to minimize my loss.

Selling off WarnerMedia sounded good at first, but I missed the part initially where they're planning to slash the dividend. Which was kind of the point of my buying in in the first place. 

I was thinking of selling off my position and puting it into something different. VZ, AMD, MSFT or something else.

I saw how much they dropped during the pandemic and never recovered plus they paid that nice dividend.

After the deal they are now cutting the dividend and separated their streaming and TV network into one which I hated. For me they are no different from Verizon at this point.

2021-06-24 15:27:42,stocks,"T has been dead money since 2000. However this change they are proposing is fairly radical, they are attempting to pay down debt and give the company more financial flexibility. T went from a predictable path of paying 7% bond proxy to... something else? Doesn't appear to be a growth stock, they are no longer dividend oriented, so what are they?"
2021-06-24 00:57:47,stocks,"I believe it will go up once everyone who is only in it for the dividends sells. Very telling that many people are getting out because of the dividend cut, but yet the stock has not exactly tanked. Most, if not all, articles I have read have the combined post merger valuation around $29 to $40 as a conservative estimate. 

There are good reasons why the post merger companies will see better value. With less better balance sheet due to reduced debt and dividend, as well as and a focus on their core business. T's multiple should increase. The NewCo's valuation may also command a higher multiple more inline with other streaming companies.

I am buying based on:

* Currently price then $29, the minimum estimate of the combined post merger stocks.
* Should be 4 more 7% dividends before the merger.
* Good chance at a $40 post merger valuation for the combined stocks. Personally, I think it will be higher, especially after we remove the final dividend holders that sell off post merger.
* I think T will try to reassert itself as a dividend aristocrat after it cuts the dividend.
* Growth is single digits for T, but I believe they will be in a good position moving forwards.
* The NewCo has tremendous growth potential.

Frankly, I am tempted to buy DISCA as well, but am going to stick with T for now since I will be getting a large chunk of the NewCo anyway.

I hope it stays low for a while though, I plan on buying up T every month until the merger."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 23, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 23, 2021** 

Stocks rose again today, as inflationary concerns continue to abate, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) powering to a new fresh intraday high driven by the continued rallies in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) The S&P 500 (SPY) continues to hover 2-3 points below its record high while the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover after suffering its worst performance since October 2020 last week. 

In a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, ‚ÄúWe will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.‚Äù He went on to further say recent price increases ‚Äúdon‚Äôt speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates‚Äù but come from factors ‚Äúdirectly affected by the reopening‚Äù. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a ‚Äúbroad set of labor market statistics‚Äù before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said ‚ÄúWe will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures‚Ä¶. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared‚Äù. 

As expected, response by lawmakers to Powell‚Äôs testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. 

Looking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings, with analysts expecting a repeat of Q1 record setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand by savings-laden consumers as the US economy is finally open to begin broadly reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine.  So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data ‚Äì an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

Moreover, tomorrow Thursday  the Fed is set to release the results of its ‚Äústress test‚Äù on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

**Highlights**

* Southwest Airlines (LUV) CEO Gary Kelly announced he would be stepping down and transitioning to becoming Executive Chairman of the Board. 
* New home sales fell unexpectedly for the second straight Month in May, according to the Commerce Department. This shows a slow down in market activity after the frenzy experienced in the beginning of this year. New home sales were down 5.9% in May over April, compared to a rise of 0.2% that was expected. 
* Amazon (AMZN) prime day was very strong despite supply chain challenges. Analyst are expecting Prime Day sales of $9.5 - $12 billion. AMZN stock currently hovers a few percentage points from its record high.
* Microsoft (MSFT) became the second company, after Apple (AAPL) to reach the $2 trillion market cap milestone. Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, briefly had a $2t market cap a while ago but has since lost it.

But if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer closed it's door tomorrow, the world would go into a decade long recession because new chips from other factories would be inferior to TSMC made. Car makers would have to halt production or make worse than previous generation vehicles, tech would stop improving. It's known that China is throwing money at this problem but it will take them years of poaching workforce from Taiwan and perfecting the tech to become what TSMC is today!

Also, remember some missteps. They have a dog of a process at 20nm. On 14nm, they were 3-5 years behind INTC.  

Bleeding edge chip manufacturing is hard sh**. Their price reflects that."
2021-06-24 04:43:37,stocks,"For one thing, TSMC is supplied its machines by ASML, which is actually the Abraham of the chip industry. Since ASML is close to being a monopoly, it can easily eat into TSMCs profits by asking for more money for their machines.

ASML on the other hand has huge, and often risky, R&D expenditures. To get to 7nm you need massive research in different directions, only one of which pays off."
2021-06-24 11:55:04,stocks,"What kind of question is this? In order for TSMC to make its chips, the workers need food and water. Therefore, how aren't Pepsi and Nestle the largest companies in the world?"
2021-06-24 12:01:39,stocks,">When you think about it, the economy of modern civilization is dependent on TSMC and chips only they have the tech and knowhow to make.

Samsung, Global Founderies, Intel, and many others exist.

TSMC's value is way up the past year due to semiconductor shortages. The problem is it's a very competitive industry with very high costs. So the margins and profit just don't compare to some larger companies. Their PE is trading at 31, in line with some of the largest companies like Apple or Microsoft."

2021-06-24 03:30:23,stocks,"That, and risk.

They might be top dog now, but you cannot dismiss Samsung and Intel. The US, China and Europe are also investing to create or strengthen national players. China, specifically, seems to lure away TSMC employees with higher salaries quite successfully.

Yes, TSMC has good longterm prospects. But there are no guarantees in this business."
2021-06-24 08:37:53,stocks,"I dont like this answer
tsmc has a very good profit margin, saying the problem is spending implies the revenue is huuuuge but the margin is low, this is very much not the case for tsmc so R&D spending is under control"

2021-06-24 12:52:34,stocks,Which fundamentals are you referring to?  I see similar TTM earnings and revenue growth. All with >20% ROE and ROI. But ASML since 2019 has expanding margins. Gross from 43 to 51 and operating from 21-32. While AMAT and LRCX margins are mostly flat. ASML improved margins due to pricing power due to its monopoly and charging more for its new EUV systems.

fabs are about production

2021-06-24 08:58:16,stocks,"yes, what I meant to say was CAPEX spending not R&D. Someone else pointed this out and I acknowledged that I got it wrong. Make sense?"
2021-06-24 14:24:41,stocks,Those help tell you whether you should buy at the current price. But not which company is the strongest. ASML currently deserves the higher PE multiple due to expanding margins and it‚Äôs earned monopoly position
2021-06-24 13:11:07,stocks,"asml is more niche in the semi conductor manufacturing chain no?  I' didn't mean they are competing against one another - just that there are steps in the semi manufacturing process and tsm isn't the only way to invest in the current shortage

There are steps in the semi manufacturing process that are just as vital or moreso than tsm.  I rather buy companies that have smaller market caps but I do own a bit of tsm as well.  Do not own asml."

-steps down from Microsoft

-sells his stocks and invested defensively in waste management, cnrail, agriculture etc

-becomes worlds largest farmer

-divorces wife and splits fortune

-his bff Buffet leaves his foundation

-predicts pandemic and pushed vaccines

-is connected to Epstein which his wife says adds to the reason for divorce

This can lead us to believe that Gates is more connected to Epstein than we know and is under pressure. We will see in Maxwell's case this November, but if he is connected to sex trafficking or engagement in pedophilic behaviour, this could explain his choices. There is no way his wife did not know of Bill's lifestyle, and she was most likely a partner rather than spouse, just as Hilary is to Bill Clinton, another elite deeply connected to the pedophile rings.

Another possibility is that Bill foresees an economic collapse. Bill has stated that global warming and bioterrorism is his greatest concerns currently. From a person who predicted a pandemic, it is possible that he is anticipating the crisis that will develop after a market crash, biological warfare with China, or devastation from climate change. 

Either way, I expect an answer to these questions to be coming in the fourth quarter this year."

They live being jealous of the love of a complete family, hating themselves and their families, contemplating suicide day by day, just wanting to give up everything because of how they feel. It‚Äôs very sad. I know some foster children are entitled to a paid for college expenses full ride but having a car can help them to and from work, visit family and not have to take the public transportation or have to feel like they are having to depend on others their whole life.

2021-06-24 08:52:02,stocks,"That's the million dollar question. If inflation get higher but otherwise remains under control, then corporate earnings will grow as consumers spend more and more on the same items that they would have otherwise purchased. If inflation gets too high, then the things like energy, consumer staples will all probably do well, as consumers continue to NEED to purchase them. Discretionary spending, though, could be negatively impacted, as there would be less left over for those purchases.

That's just my wild guess. I'm not an economist, I'm a Redditor!

But I'm not sure what you're getting at with the Foundation. The charity he's giving the majority of his wealth to is the Gates Foundation. He already wrote/spoke about it - he decided he likes their mission, they already have expertise in executing it and in managing billions and billions worth of investments, there wasn't a point in creating his own foundation just to have his name on it after he goes.

If he was still trying to run up his wealth score card at this point, he would have pledged his shares after death, not give it away while he was alive. So really, I have no idea what you're getting at in the second part of your reply. As he said, as far as he's concerned, his game (lifetime) has reached extra innings. He knows full well that any day could be his last, he's not trying to run up his wealth at this point, at least not any more than however well Berkshire stock performs for the remainder of his lifetime."

I don‚Äôt care that a person wants to control their own money but he is trying to act like he is above the money and has separated himself from it which he hasn‚Äôt. It is really good that he lives a modest life in some of the outward respects but that is his business.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,stocks,"CLNE - A very promising long term stock Hello people of r/stocks! Recently there has been a push to promote CLNE on WSB but I think the members of this community should be our target audience. I‚Äôve been seeing so many people say CLNE ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù or stress about one bad day of trading and if you‚Äôre looking for the ‚Äúnext‚Äù AMC you‚Äôre not being realistic by buying into CLNE. This is a company that is still trying to build its infrastructure, and major changes like converting freight from diesel to RNG will take time. I am very optimistic about this stock though due to the Amazon warrant and previous stocks that had warrants executed under this circumstance.


I‚Äôm a certified idiot so take all of this information with that in mind but three companies that Amazon previously executed warrants for make me believe the growth potential for this could be very enticing in the long term.


KRNT had a warrant price of $13.03 and it‚Äôs value as I type this is $119

PLUG had a $1.20 warrant and at the time of execution it was valued at $60(now at $34.25)

ATSG had a warrant for $9.73 and at the time of execution it was at $30(now at $23.24)


With CLNE‚Äôs warrant being at $13.49 and Amazon‚Äôs investment track record I‚Äôm feeling very comfortable just buying and holding as the company continues to develop it‚Äôs infrastructure and I think anyone that is looking for long term gains should do some research into this stock.

TLDR: CLNE is an undervalued stock that in my opinion is a buy and HODL. It has been making big pushes to solidify its infrastructure and has added valuable partners in Amazon and BP.


I am not a financial adviser and take this post with that discretion in mind. 

From what I saw in the rules I need to add this? Currently holding 527 shares of CLNE as well as some options(07/16 and 12/17)"
2021-06-24 14:00:02,stocks,"I‚Äôd you are investing in CLNE, you need to understand that the economic driver is the Renewable Fuel Standard and Biden may give big oil a reprieve.

2021-06-23 22:36:54,stocks,There is no company on Earth that knows how to make money better than Disney. IMO it should be a cornerstone of a portfolio. I believe they‚Äôre unfairly getting beat up on the stock solely from their Disney+ subscription numbers. Keep in mind they hit their 5 year goal in under 6 months. They have strong leadership and a great business model.
2021-06-24 01:01:36,stocks,"It's one of my rare individual holdings that is still red, and I'm not happy about it, but I do fully believe that it will grow.

My 65 year old mom born in Yugoslavia: loved Disney her whole childhood - and to this dayMy students from China: all girls want to be Elsa from Frozen; they buy merch, etc.

My four-year-old here in the US wants to go to Disneyland. My cousins' kids in Europe want to go to Disneyland.

This is as anecdotal as Peter Lynch's wife stockings (that made him money in the market), but when I see people from three different generations on three different continents loving a company - I just don't see it going anywhere but up."

2021-06-23 23:51:35,stocks,"Ok, so there‚Äôs some good answers here and some really bad answers here.  Here‚Äôs what happens with a stock split: any shares are split 4 new shares per each share.  The 6/21 date doesn‚Äôt really matter to you unless you‚Äôre a broker.  You can ignore that.  

So what does this mean for you?  If you bought Nvidia tomorrow at open, you would still get the split of 4 shares for each share you held.  Doesn‚Äôt matter the date you bought, the record date is for the brokers.  I bought Tesla and Apple after the record dates, they still split.  This will too.  Otherwise it would be a mess to have some shares worth more than others, or it‚Äôd be really bad for investor relations for any shares bought for a month to just go down 75% in value."
2021-06-24 02:24:37,stocks,"Just buy as much NVDA as you possibly can.

\*Not financial advice\*

\*\*Just kidding, get rich\*\*"
2021-06-23 21:03:07,stocks,True. You must have held the stick on June 21. Any purchase after is not eligible for the split. I held both Apple and Telsa before split. You just get more stock. The price is also split. So no gain.
2021-06-23 20:29:20,stocks,LOL
2021-06-23 23:41:09,stocks,"But it didn't rally? They both sold off after the split, the news was priced in as in the stock moved up already pre-split. Same as what NVDA is doing now."
2021-06-23 23:53:37,stocks,"6/21 is the *record date.* When the 3 dividend shares are distributed on 7/20 they will be sent to the brokers of the owners as of 6/21. Those brokers are then responsible for forwarding them to whoever has the actual shares if they've been sold.

In reality, the ""sent"" only affects paper shares. 99.9% of the split distribution will happen in a few seconds in the computers of the DTCC, as they simply multiply all the holding numbers by 4.

If you buy 100 shares at $800 on 7/19, on the morning of 7/20 you'll have 400 shares in your account and the MMs will be setting opening prices around $200."
2021-06-24 00:53:06,stocks,"You know AAPL announced that it was splitting at the end of july right? And TSLA was mid august.

Might want to look at those charts again if you think they ""sold off after the split."""
2021-06-23 23:52:28,stocks,"The record date only matters to the brokers, not the retail investors.  You buy tomorrow, you get the split still."
2021-06-24 02:41:42,stocks,"> AAPL and TSLA skyrocketed *when* they split because their prices were more appealing


You‚Äôre point was it rallied *when* they split. Because the price is lower and more appealing. Not when they *announced* the split."
2021-06-24 04:22:32,stocks,"Maybe you should look at the chart? I'm not quite sure what you're looking at. AAPL announced it was splitting end of July, massive rally on the news and it split as of August 30. Sells off from a high of 137 down to 103 in a matter of 7-8 trading days. It literally sold off $7 per day the first TWO days after it starts trading post split."
2021-06-24 04:26:55,stocks,"Same with TSLA. Which split like a day after AAPL did, sells off even harder. Drops from 500 to 330 in 5 trading days after the day it started trading post split. Its literally like ER IV crush except far steeper. Rallies post split announcement and moves up until the date of the split and then sells off after. The notion that it's more attractive to own because its cheaper is false because literally every broker allows fractional shares."
2021-06-23 21:13:10,stocks,I think you found the information everyone is looking for.
2021-06-24 02:59:19,stocks,You caught me. They rallied hard when it was announcing that they were going to split. Does it have to go up in a straight line for the split to have positively impacted the stock?
2021-06-23 22:09:11,stocks,"The right to split shares is transferred with purchase. If you buy after, you are buying from someone who owned before June 21 and so you will have the rights to split shares as well. Its just a legal wya of phrasing. You get split shares no matter when you buy them."

2021-06-24 08:52:31,stocks,So you wait until the market crashes to get in. Then you won't get in because the market is going down. You'll be sitting on the sidelines again. There is always a reason not to get in.
2021-06-23 23:14:07,stocks,"1. I haven‚Äôt insulted anyone, just people‚Äôs dumb ideas, and if you think ‚Äúturkey‚Äù is a dog whistle you need to wear a helmet and never leave home. You really are a special kind of weak. And scouring people‚Äôs comment history for some way to use it against them is pretty fucking pathetic. I‚Äôm sorry it didn‚Äôt work out for you.

2. You don‚Äôt need proof to be skeptical. You need proof to not be skeptical. This should be obvious to those who think.

The stock market *has gone up* over time. That is not proof that it will always do so. To think otherwise makes you a turkey. A turkey thinks that just because it‚Äôs been fed every day, it is a proven fact that it will always be fed every day. Every day that it‚Äôs fed bolsters its confidence that the trend is permanent. Then one day it gets slaughtered. You‚Äôre a turkey and you‚Äôll lose everything."

2021-06-24 01:14:01,stocks,"Generally speaking ADR's convey legal ownership of shares but definitely do your research about the country you are investing in. For example, South Korea does not allow foreign ownership of their aviation, broadcast and communication companies but everything else is ok.

China doesnt allow any foreign ownership of any stock. I dont think you can buy real estate there either unless you work there or go to school there for a year. Which is why I think the USA should block their ownership here in the USA. It needs to be a two way street."
2021-06-24 00:52:43,stocks,"I agree. I do feel like Elon's backtracking on the Coin (I do not own crypto, so this isn't about that) might have been more connected to the fact that he was pretty much summoned to a meeting in China after endorsing it rather than the environmental concerns that he had to be well aware off."

Don't get trapped in the oil play thinking prices will reach 2018 levels on the stocks themselves, it's not going to happen. I still think these have a little bit more to run but I trimmed 2/3rds of my positions when we hit $70 and I'm selling out when we hit $75."

Their medications are the mainstays of therapy for patients suffering from CF. The company's cystic fibrosis products are in a more mature stage of growth in the United States where sales grew 6% Y/Y to $1.25 billion but 43% Y/Y growth in Europe boosted the growth rate. The trial failure points to a larger problem of them having success outside of CF. They are working with CRISPR therapeutics to develop a drug for beta-thalassemia and Sickle Cell disease, however, this is a gene editing therapy that is a one-time treatment costing ~$1 million per patient representing a total market opportunity of $35 billion.

Most of my dabbling the past five/six years has been buying things I am certain will grow over the long run, and holding on to them. I got Netflix at $150 for example back in 2015. Still have it. I've been considering doing something faster where I buy at a lower price and sell after a certain amount of gain in only a few days, but wouldn't the taxes kill off most gains?

Meanwhile Peloton‚Äôs biggest pain point historically has been supply chain, and Apple has the best supply chain in the world behind Amazon. They could acquire PTON and turn it into an instant money-maker by expediting orders that have been delayed and lowering manufacturing costs.

The two brands just have remarkable affinity. I‚Äôd be willing to bet that 90% of Peloton users have iPhones. Even if Apple did decide to make their own bike, do they really want to compete with a brand that shares their demo and is beloved by its users? I don‚Äôt see many Peloton users selling their $3,000 bike or leaving their favorite trainer just because Apple enters the market.

2021-06-23 23:20:49,stocks,"I dug it up. It's a mess.

https://www.hotelbusiness.com/blackstone-starwood-capital-complete-acquisition-of-extended-stay-america/

Extended Stay was doing business as two companies with one ""paired"" ticker.

Blackrock and Starwood then bought the whole thing to take it private. That's why the ticker vanished. It's no longer tradeable.

The dividend was announced and apparently paid at the same time the sale was approved and completed, which was 6/15.

It's unclear if you would get a check for the $1.75 dividend or for the full $20.50 purchase price, and if you get to keep either one or have to ship it to the person you sold or bought from. It's also unclear if the shares even existed at the moment you sold them.

The brokers are going to have to sort this out."

Keep asking your broker what's going on with it. And if it turns out you were misled, and it was a lot of money, start contacting securities class-action law firms to be a lead plaintiffs. If not, just keep searching for news about the company the and you'll see the law firms press releases start to pop up like weeds. You can contact one to get on a list to be informed what you get when it's all over. Usually pennies compared to what you were swindled for."

2021-06-23 21:52:27,stocks,"It‚Äôs a lesson that a lot of people have to learn. A ton more people learned it last year. I can‚Äôt tell you how many people on r/investing told me I was an idiot and that they were cashing out. They will never recover from that, literally ever. It‚Äôs not possible. They‚Äôll still grow their money when they get back in but the difference that missing last year‚Äôs recovery bull run makes over long term compound investing is absolutely massive. It‚Äôs similar to how missing the ten biggest days in the market over a twenty year period‚Äîthe difference is literally like 30% compounded. 

Hmm I‚Äôm not sure where I mentioned that I had 80-90% in stocks. I have 100% in the market, however not all of it is in stocks because I use it to put up collateral for cash secured puts. When you get more knowledgeable about the market there are some great options strategies that are very lucrative‚Äîand have nothing to do with $GME calls (though I did do pretty well on those lol). They‚Äôre safer strategies in which you‚Äôre writing options contracts to generate premium. Essentially you get to act as an insurance company. I suggest learning the basics first but conservative short options strategies have made me incredible returns at times. 

(For example, at this point I‚Äôd much rather sell a put on GME than buy shares or calls. I just made almost $2,000 writing a 207.5 strike put on GME that expires on July 2. Meaning, I‚Äôm selling to someone else the right to sell GME at 207.5 no matter how low it drops. If it doesn‚Äôt drop below 207.5, we‚Äôll, then they‚Äôre shit out of luck and I keep my $2,000. If it does drop below 207.5, I have to buy the shares from them at 207.5 no matter how far it drops. I‚Äôll take that bet for a lot of reasons, but I‚Äôm just giving an example of how lucrative these conservative options strategies can be.)"

2021-06-24 00:43:36,stocks,"You won't be at a loss.

The stock is 3.70, and you've collected a .30 premium (if that was what the option paid).

If the option is exercised you'll give up the stock but collect 5.00 in proceeds. That plus your .30 premium is 5.30.

You paid 4.70, so your profit is .60.

Even if the stock is $20 when it's called, you get 5.00 and make the same .60 profit. That other $15 is lost opportunity, not money out of your pocket.

But nobody exercises OTM options, so if the price doesn't go above 5.00 before expiry, they'll expire and you'll have the .30 and the shares at whatever price they're at."
2021-06-24 00:28:01,stocks,"Look up XIV.

Leveraged funds use derivatives to achieve the leverage. Derivatives are their own market and that market can go illiquid, forcing the fund to trade at unreasonable prices to meet the contractual daily rebalancing. That can make the fund insolvent. Usually they have a trigger point (a maximum change per day) at which they simply cease operating to avoid insolvency. That means if the change is transitory, you don't get the benefit of the retracement. You just get locked into the loss.

The risk on leveraged funds is therefore much higher than just the leverage times the volatility of the thing they track."

>Any new production capacity is met with new capital expenditure thus making that new production initially cost more than existing production. Lower prices makes this worse. That‚Äôs why in the Oil sector, rig counts fall as prices fall

That happens because producers know the oil they own is finite and they don't want to waste it in a cheap market. They'd rather store it in the ground and wait for a more profitable future.

Gold producers do the same thing, but less, because gold has been ridiculously overvalued for 40 years."

Say I had $1.01 and I wanted to compound it by 11% over 211 years. Can you actually show me the formula for this? I mean... surely a smart fellow like you can show his work right?

2021-06-24 01:38:32,stocks,"Passive index investing always delivers average returns (8-10%/y historical), so there is a motivation (greed) and reasonable necessity (to individually invest in undervalued assets) to find better deals and get better returns by both institutions and individual investors. One reason mutual funds and other financial vehicles are pushed by active managers is that the livelihood of managers and analysts is dependent on fees from these funds. For individual investors, choosing a mutual fund over an index fund can be very wise if the market in general is considered to be overvalued/risky (e.g. precisely because of massive money inflow from index funds) and one needs an expert to pick singular undervalued companies. But in this case, before investing, the history of the active manager should be kept into consideration. (how did the manager's funds perform in bad economic conditions?)

Index investing seems to only work stably in the USA because the collective underlying companies have always grown in value overtime (compare japan's Nikkei 225 index which do not deliver such returns annual on average.) So index investing is a free lunch on the back of US economy and active investors that study and trade companies everyday. If the whole market only invested via index funds, we would get massive bubbles in concentrated companies (which would make these companies very risky and the ignored companies outside index funds immediately more attractive). Every strategy become a losing strategy at one point, making the other one the winning ticket.

It is the consensus among successful investors that there will be a day in the future when passive index investing will not work. (e.g. the day US economy becomes a senior citizen like Japan's, or when machine learning enables perfect stock picking and timing - which will kill human selection (active management))"
