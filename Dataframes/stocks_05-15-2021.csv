2021-05-15 19:57:57,stocks,"Yeah she runs thematic etf’s. Want her to own more MSFT? Why buy her thematic etf then? Thousands of other etf’s and mutual funds hold the obvious stuff.

Valid criticism: she’s buying up way too high of a % stake in many illiquid names, and will throw the kitchen sink at propping up underperforming names in her portfolio (selling more of a good performing, liquid name, to sink further into an underperforming, illiquid name).

Edit: I don’t hold any ark funds. In fact, I’ve been profitably shorting it. But that’s purely because I have been shorting the ultra growth theme lately, not that I think Cathie is a turd or some shit."
2021-05-15 19:57:18,stocks,A lot of the Robinhood crowd who jumped on her momentum didn’t do enough research to didn’t care to understand the risks involved with the companies in the fund. Now they are all made they have lost money. I don’t think she did anything wrong.
2021-05-15 17:35:55,stocks,your 401k should have a positions page
2021-05-15 17:41:40,stocks,What ston said.   There should be a page with what the holdings are.   Be aware that some funds may be for institutional only.   But others have both such.   Like BARAX vs BARIX.  One is retail investor and one institution.
2021-05-15 17:45:40,stocks,Why do you want to do this? Why spend after tax money to duplicate pre tax holdings?
2021-05-15 18:20:46,stocks,The “target retirement 20XX” - these are mutual funds that cater to 401K's and IRA's so it sounds like that is where your 401K money is.

2021-05-15 17:53:37,stocks,Exactly. Why not just contribute more to your 401K?
2021-05-15 18:39:21,stocks,I’m not going to touch my 401k…I’ve had some bad luck with stocks personally while my 401k has gone up 20% in the last year.

2021-05-15 16:34:50,stocks,"All good choices. Pretty in line with what I usually reply to these “what can I get into besides tech”. My answer is always:

WFC should up their dividend soon when the Fed allows them to.

DIS is a long term winner - and I think it’s a good entry point now with its recent 30 point pullback in the last 2 months.

LOW/HD - home improvement isn’t going away and a lot of what they offer can’t be replaced by online retail.

TGT/WMT - again retail, but both have upped their online presence with same day/next day delivery locally. I prefer TGT - I think they have more expansion possibilities. WMT is pretty much what it’ll be (in my opinion).

T/VZ/TMUS - technically some tech aspects - but I wouldn’t lump them with typical tech names.

KO/PEP - I think it’s a personal preference. PEP is more diversified with their addition of Frito-Lay.

Also some good choices in materials: NUE (American steel), DOW, Martin Marietta Materials (construction infrastructure and other stuff), Sherwin Williams (people will always need paint)"

2021-05-15 16:56:10,stocks,"I'm personally bullish on AMC in the short term due to the potential for a squeeze, as well as the influx of demand and big blockbuster movies as Covid restrictions are lifted.  With that said, I'm curious what your rationale for calling it currently undervalued is? The stock is effectively trading at all time highs if you account for the increase in shares. That's obviously not rooted in fundamentals, given the company hasn't had any notable revenue for a year now and had a struggling business model even before Covid. I agree with you AMC could rise quite a bit for the reasons you said in your post, but those are speculative and not an indicator of current value."

Metals are only going to continue to increase, and as these companies grow revenues higher, they'll improve. Sure, the best time to get in was months ago, but there's a lot more room to run than some of the other popular overpriced companies this sub likes to pump, like tech."
2021-05-15 17:27:22,stocks,"I definitely went unconventional, and added a lot of risk that most people aren't comfortable with. I'm currently in USOI for the coupon payments, and snapped up a ton of PBR when it bottomed out after Bolsonaro fired their CEO. My thesis is that USO has hit its floor with oil demand returning to pre covid levels, and the 25% yield is a lower risk investment, although the ETN structure represents more risk than normal investments. For PBR, they're one of the largest oil companies in South America, a region that will be one of the last to cut dependence on oil, and perhaps one of the few oil plays that hasn't recovered from its covid crash. But state run companies bring a lot of volatility.

I've seen positive returns on both, but they're ideally multi year holds, so we'll see how they play out going forward."

2021-05-15 18:28:12,stocks,"I agree if you only look at value in the traditional, fundamental sense, but one thing we can all agree on is that things are happening in the world that most never anticipated which directly impacts investments and the stock market as a whole. I see value, in part, is changing in the market from the traditional fundamentals. I like the turnaround story regarding re-opening from COVID, the 100 year old great American company, and people in the past saying the invention of the TV, VCR, streaming, and hedge funds was going to kill the movie business. It ain't happening. I see any 100 year old business with a CEO like Adam Aron, along with 3.2 million individual investors, owning 80 percent of the company, and who are fanatical about the story, as having tremendous value that many other good companies do not possess. Like any other stock different indicators hold various value levels for the individual investor."

The biggest discount I have seen when looking for rooms was the Intercontinental in Kansas City. The presidential suite was $1,100 a night checking through the IHG app it was $2,500. Way more then I would ever spend but it was greater than 50% off. 

Now if I had some friend that where willing to split the bill that would be a different story. The worst discount I ever saw was at a Candlewood Suites in Houston Texas for $25 off a 2 week stay. Not really a discount but the stay was not that much either. 

I only use the discount when traveling with my wife and kids. Otherwise my company can foot the bill so I can rack up the points."
2021-05-15 18:58:47,stocks,"Supplier pricing when purchasing a new vehicle. So you pay what the dealership pays. It’s kind of a pain to use as you have to call Ford once you find a car. They call the dealership they call you, you call them back the dealership throws a fit since they lose money unless they bought it outright and didn’t finance it. 

But it’s worth the trouble depending on how much profit said dealership you are purchasing from is trying to make. Could be several thousand cheaper or a few thousand cheaper."

Major risk as they pointed out a few months ago is boats can be cyclical, I think there was a boat downturn in 2007-2010. They also have a much higher debt load than Marine Max - the refinancing with Goldman last fall helped a lot and also feel they’ll grow their way out of it. Their CEO selling a bunch of shares last December rattled me but wow, he left a lot of money on the table. 

If you buy and hold you’ll likely do very well, they run tight operations and would buy this any day of the week over Marine Max (or other roll ups like CWH or LAZY). Pretty volatile and feel like the stock gets manipulated on some trading days (eg look at what happened after last earnings)."

2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,going to exodus from FAANG because some outdated T-bill pays .25% higher? Who feels inflation fears should not drop tech stocks ?   Everyone has piled into assets because of inflation fears!   Inflation means asset prices rise!  And FAANG stocks are immune to commodity inflation like lumber and copper.   Fear of rate hikes?  Are people really going to exodus from FAANG because some outdated T-bill pays .25% higher?  That's literally a rounding error when meme stock performance is like 300% a year.
2021-05-15 14:38:14,stocks,"It's not about people choosing Tbills instead of stocks.  It's about discounting your future cashflows.  The price of growth stocks is heavily dependent on cash flows in the distant future.  Those distant future cashflows have to be discounted over a lot of years.  When interest rates are super low like they are now adding a quarter percent to the risk free rate will have a significant effect.

If you are holding less than a year, this is all absolutely a big deal and if you are holding for 5 years who gives a shit. A great company with great numbers is a great company with great numbers.

Second, try running a DCF model with 3% higher rate and see how much it’ll drop the value of all these companies with big revenues stretch out over the next 5-10 years...and you’ll see that their value will indeed be 20-40% lower than at the previous rates.

That’s what the market is worried about.  Given you don’t understand this, and what drives prices...Well, just be careful out there.  You have much to learn about why tech has done well.  Hint, it’s not the tech, it’s the growth prospects vs the current low interest rates."

There is some sentiment that they are too expensive, but consider that they were sporting higher PE and PS ratios a couple of years ago when T-bills and interest rates were higher than today. And there are few signs that they are going to grow slower from here; it's been the opposite actually based on the past earnings reports this year.

They are well-priced now by all historical measures. Why, Coke and McDonald's are sporting higher prices than them and yet not growing as quickly. Some areas of the market are frothy and big tech isn't one of them."

It’s a very big difference with that 3% change(744k vs 558k...or imagine your stock price was 74.40 in this scenario.  It means a 3% interest rate rise would drop it to 55.80, which is a 25% drop).

**VW ID.4 sales have started, Skoda Enyaqs as well, and Audi Etron Q4 is still to come to customers in June. All three cars are based on the MEB platforms and are direct competitors to Tesla's Model Y, which will be delayed by at least half a year in Europe**. Volkswagen is growing at breakneck speed. If they can maintain this pace, they would sell almost 60k EVs per quarter in Europe alone. Volkswagen estimates to sell 500k hybrids and 500k pure electric cars in 2021.

Volkswagen currently has a P/E ratio of 9.5, it is insanely cheap!

Market gains will start to be significant around 2030 at which point there will be a fight for supremacy as fuel car manufacturers try to keep the consumers interested in their product *because of the gas companies*.  Fuel car manufacturers WILL be supported by the major gasoline companies (COP, CVX, XOM, BP, RDS) and they will go all in to affect the market after they feel the heat of less demand, and gasoline refiners will partner with the fuel car manufacturers to change consumer direction and save their own corporations. Expect extreme volatility in the early 2030s, as we watch crazy marketing campaigns attempt to change consumer preference, but by 2040 the proportion of fuel cars on the street to electric cars will have shifted to majority being electric."

2021-05-15 16:57:25,stocks,"What people seem to miss as well is that the profit margin on an EV is considerably worse than on an ICE, so by cannibalising those sales they’re also making less money on them.

That said, watch the automotive makers financial results this year, my prediction is that they’re going to sky rocket, as they all would have squirrelled away provisions for last financial year due to the pandemic, but the used RV’s this year in Europe and the US have been stupidly strong due to reduced supply, so expect to see strong profits when they have to release most of their provisions."
2021-05-15 10:32:19,stocks,There is a transition from ice to EV going on. So VW would slowly loose sales by not selling EVs. So they try to capture a big chunk of the EV market (which they do) to offset the loss and grow even further by a higher EV adoption rate.

1. Battery tech. I don't know enough here to say if it's exclusive but I do know they have a mass manufacturing process for a battery that's more compact and more efficient than what was available and it's coming with the Berlin gigafactory I believe.    
Reducing mass, size and having more energy density and output is what can keep them at the too imo.    
2. Self driving. I don't know where the races are here. Lots of companies doing stuff. I know NIO are doing stuff. Someone bought Ubers? Data recently?    
Self driving is the future. Self driving taxis and trucks is a crazy proposition for profitability in the future. 24 hours of activity for the car or truck (less a few hours for charging). That's saving 400-800 on driver fees per day. The margins are going to be insane for whoever gets in there and does it right."

2021-05-15 19:09:46,stocks,"Yea, the ID3 is a a direct competitor to the Golf for example. Like how the ID4 is to the Tiguan. And the Golf is one of VW’s best selling model. A buyer who bought the ID3 could’ve been a Golf purchaser. 

And keep in mind that we have yet to see whether the ID3 is profitable or not. If it is profitable, what is the margin compared to the Golf? The Golf definitely is profitable as it is already an old platform with little iterations between different generations. The question now would be if the ID3 is already profitable, if not, when will it be? Or is its sole purpose for now is to avoid getting fined for pollution? Remember, VW surpassed the pollution cap last year, despite the massive push for the ID3. 

VW, definitely can’t afford to only sell ICE cars now because of the new pollution standards. So like it or not, they have to add electric vehicles or hybrids in their line-up.

The problem now you see, is platform diversity. Too many platforms in your line-up is expensive to maintain in the long run. Your production line is not optimised and the cost of development of each platform for specific power train increases because of reduced volume. 

So ideally, you’d want to minimise your platform say, by only keeping an EV platform. Now imagine a scenario where VW resort to this. Would they be able to be profitable? Battery cost is really expensive in an EV and Tesla seems to have achieved a good cost to make a profitable EV now. 

If they chose this path, it also raises question on their business in emerging markets where EV are just expensive. How would it impact their profits?"

If it ever happens, it'll be on an open standard approved and enforced by law – and it will probably differ by country. Just like today each country has their own slant on ethical questions like how much to spend on terminally ill medical care, or things like data privacy.

You can't have x amount of companies all running their own proprietary version of what is the correct way of driving – I mean you can, in theory, as long as they uphold traffic laws everything is dandy. That is until somebody dies due to an AI decision – and every public official up for election will wash their hands in the nearest ethical sink.

The Uber accident in 2018 pretty much killed Uber and self driving. No discussion about how self driving might result in fewer traffic deaths overall ( well, none that could be heard over the public outcry and bandwagoning amongst politicians ). You put the decision right in front of humans and they will falter under public scrutiny. We simply don't like making those decisions – and while i believe we will one day accept it, it won't ride in on the back of some single company being allowed to wield a monopoly.

2021-05-15 14:42:21,stocks,"Are you aware that the fastest way to charge a battery is to charge it only up to 50%? After 50%, charging becomes slower and slower. So in all practicality your effective range is really half a battery not a full battery.. unless you are going to charge it overnight.. which works great for small city driving after which u charge your car overnight.. but would be not possible for example for me who makes occasional long drives from Arizona to California. Until batteries can allow thousands of miles of range without charging. Other than that it's not possible to stop for 30 min or 1 hour to charge the battery up to 50% then continue the trip.. please correct me if I'm wrong.

I understand the allure of EV. But for the average user in the United States outside of use within city limits it seems to me they are still very far behind. They need to be able to beat the time of ICE gas refill which is essentially 5 minutes."

In my view however, one benefit of owning an expensive asset such as a motor vehicle is to be reliable and able to transport you anywhere anytime. If i have to hop into my car in the middle of the night and drive because of some unforseen emergency can the EV help me? I know it's one of those rare examples but they are valid concerns for any user and simply an area where ICE still wins. It almost seems like people will need to have a back-up ICE and that EV can't be your only car just yet.

2021-05-15 16:07:07,stocks,"That's a really good point. I personally feel like there's a division in Tesla investors. On the one hand you've got the people that just want to see Tesla shit on the other automakers and don't really care so much about their mission, but more about their status and stock price. On the other hand you've got the people that support Tesla's mission and would love to see competitors help accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, but are disappointed by the legacy automakers' lack of devotion to EVs.

Personally I'm in the second camp, where I'm just dumbfounded and quite honestly frustrated every time I hear a company like BWM or Toyota say that hybrids are the future, or a GM or Ford announce a product to come out 3 years from now with specs that are already pretty bad today at a totally uncompetitive price (I'm looking at you electric Hummer).

VW is one of the exceptions in my opinion, together with Hyundai, Volvo/Polestar and maybe one or two others that are actually trying. Even though their cars still have serious problems (especially VW's), I agree people - including Tesla shareholders - should be commending and encouraging them to push the adoption of EVs.

2021-05-15 14:57:37,stocks,"You are happily wrong. If you are interested I could go into detail. Suffice to say, for a very large segment of consumers EV is ready for adoption right now. Norway for instance is 80% plugin sales. Even in your occassional long haul scenario a model 3 LR would probably work fine.

EV mass adoption on Norwegian levels are probably no more than a couple of years off in most of the west and it is a good thing even if you arent an environment nut."
2021-05-15 16:41:29,stocks,"Here's the low down.  


A)   


Actually, at least on my Model 3, charging up to around 70% is relatively fast. Here's Teslabjörn running a hands on test:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWkyXApmOpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWkyXApmOpQ)

What this means is that you'll charge from around 10% to around 70% in give or take 12-15 minutes. On a Model 3 LR that means roughly 200km range if you have a lead foot like me (\~200wh/km). It means you'll probably stop every 1.5-2 hours. You get much farther on a charge with more reasonable speed (100-110km/h) but Sheepherder don't play like that.  


Most people who get an EV will charge at home, and if you are like me with a fair commute (120km return) you'll use about 30% of your battery on that trip and you'll want to charge nightly. This means that the 95-98% of the time when you aren't doing a road trip you'll never really think about your battery. Plugging in becomes as normal as washing your hands after you take a shit. (As in some people don't, but you really should.)  


B) 

As you can now see, the 30-60 minute stops you're afraid of aren't going to be necessary unless you want to. Ahead of any long trip you'll charge to 90 or 100% depending on how nervous you are about battery degradation, and that will get you around 300km which is way longer than a lot of people will want to drive without a stop.

I've only done one long road trip so far (two days 1500km) but what I can say is it felt very natural to make those frequent stops and the drive was less taxing than it would've normally been.  


At no point did I worry I wouldn't reach a charger in time, and while I spent maybe at a guess 90-120 minutes on charging, much of that time would've been spent on leg stretchers or food breaks in an ICE car anyway. On the morning of the second day for instance I got up a bit early and charged the car while the rest of the group was having breakfast.

In conclusion, what you're worried about is what everyone is worried about before they start really looking at the reality of EV, but once you're past the hurdle of that worry you'll find that you didn't need to worry. 

No, you will not feel a need to charge to full in 5 minutes. I promise you.

No, you will not feel a need to have a thousand miles in the battery. You can take that to the bank.

Will you \*want\* to charge to full in 5 and have a thousand miles in your battery? Absolutely! I'd love to. But the reality is that while charging may be quicker, what is likely to happen is that batteries become cheaper and most people won't want to pay for thousand-mile batteries even when they become available. Knowing what I know now, I would absolutely not want to pay €30 000 more for twice the range, and frankly maybe not even €10k more. The 550-odd WLTP of the Model 3 LR is more than enough.

The real problem right now is not range, it's cost. Additionally, for Scandinavians, it's the lack of towing capability. Both of these issues will be fixed within the next few years. Prices are already dropping and towing capability is increasing.

That said, as you can see from Norwegian and Swedish sales numbers, even with these real hurdles, adoption is coming and as you can see from Norway it's a real snow-ball effect. Anyone buying an ICE-car in Norway today is going to regret it very shortly.

At the end of the day, nothing I've said thus far can really persuade you if you're certain that I'm wrong, but everything can be easily verified by simply taking a rental out on your own.

If you don't believe me, try it and come tell me how wrong I am afterwards. I would advice you start with a test drive of a Model 3. Just be careful with the accelleration. It kicks like a rollercoaster.

Once you've done that, if you're still itching to prove me wrong, rent one for a week and go on a trip with it. I promise you that if you do it with an open mind you'll absolutely find your worries are completely unfounded.

That is to say as long as you live somewhere with super chargers. If you don't, I can certainly understand the hesitation!"
2021-05-15 15:42:25,stocks,"Are you aware that the Model S has a range of 412 miles? If you charge it overnight and then charge it to 50% once during your break, you're at a 618 miles range.

As an example, the average taxi driver in New York drives about 120 miles during a 12-hour working day. They could drive FIVE TIMES their average distance on a single day and still be okay.

Yes, charge times are irrelevant 99% of the times."
2021-05-15 16:15:02,stocks,"True, there are definitely downsides to EVs and even though they may only apply to rare scenarios, they definitely should be considered. That said, I think people are too focused on the downsides of EVs while ignoring the downsides of ICE vehicles because we are used to them.

For example, let's imagine we would've been using EVs all this time and suddenly we had to switch to using ICE cars for some reason. Everyone would be complaining how they had to stop at a fuel station every couple hundred miles, how they had to replace their brakes 10x faster, or how often they had to replace this new clutch thing,  how complex the engine was with its thousands of extra moving parts and all the reliability issues that come with that, how air quality would be getting worse, how expensive the refuelling is, how noisy they are, how uncomfortable the driving with gears and no instant torque is, I could keep going for a while.

Even taking your example, if you suddenly had to hop into your car in the middle of the night and drive because of some unforeseen emergency, you could find yourself to be nearly out of gas and have to take a detour just to refuel your car. Whereas with an EV unless it would happen within 30-60 min from you coming home after a day where you drove 400 miles, it would probably already be sufficiently charged."
2021-05-15 17:03:32,stocks,"Yes (although calling it ""market manipulation"" is a bit ridiculous), but do you also know they lost a substantial amount of profits from selling no Model S/X this quarter, or that they spent 200M on a one-time update of the Model S/X production lines for the refresh, 300M on Musk's stock-based compensation that's coming to an end this year, 100M on loan interests that they could pay off immediately if they wanted to, and have accumulated up to 1.6B in deferred revenue that they have yet to recognize?

2021-05-15 18:58:38,stocks,"Tesla's PE is in the 500s as of right now (in the 100s if you consider forward PE) so you are somewhat exaggerating.

But I think Tesla justifies their PE quite well. They are the only EV manufacturer with an international sales presence (US, EU, and Asia), the only EV manufacturer with plans to move battery production in-house, and the only EV manufacturer dipping into the renewable energy sector with their proprietary solar panels and battery packs. If they are successful (which they will be), then yes, they will have deserved their high PE.

Besides, the PE simply reflects what people are willing to pay for a share of Tesla. The fact that the PE is high means that people and institutions see the potential in what Tesla is doing. A PE of 12 does not indicate much future growth. Like you said they can hold everything the same for 30 years and no one would notice. I am not saying that is bad if what you want is a stable company. But if you want to get excited for the future, Tesla is where the action is. VW, Ford, GM, et al are working on it, but they are so far behind."
2021-05-15 16:48:53,stocks,"The way I see it, their priority seems to be increasing production as much as possible. They seem to sell every car they make, so they are prioritizing investing their profits into new factories, for example, over better quarterly numbers. They produced 500k cars last year and they are on track to increase their production by 50% this year (there is even some speculation that they are aiming for 1 million cars this year). Also, they usually talk about their long term goals (like their goal of producing 20M cars in 2030) and not their quarter to quarter perfomance. We'll just have to wait a couple years and see.

Their valuation is crazy, yes, if you base it on their current business (which is fair). The only way you could justifiy that valuation is if you are pretty confident that they will solve FSD and make a lot money through that."

2021-05-15 19:48:09,stocks,"The problem with that is that solid state batteries are in technological lock-in and will be for at least a decade. It's a better technology in theory, but it will need to get to mass production before it becomes more profitable than li-ion batteries, and getting to mass production will take a while as long as it's more expensive.

You're correct in saying that Tesla isn't very profitable, but the reason is not become EVs are unprofitable, but because Tesla is trying to drive costs down as quickly as possible to increase demand and force other automakers to follow. They sold out all of their Q2 production in the first month, so they could easily be selling their cars for much higher prices and make a higher profit, but that's not their strategy.

The 4680 won't change anything about their strategy. They will always keep cutting prices as they reduce costs. The only way Tesla becomes profitable is if they solve FSD, because cutting prices on that won't accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.

As for Toyota waiting until EVs become more profitable, I think that might indeed be the case. Either that, which won't happen until it's far too late for them to still make the transition, or they're just milking ICE as long as they can while the executives and shareholders secure a nice retirement and they'll let the automotive branch go to shit afterwards. These people are not stupid, they know that making the transition to EVs will cost anywhere between 200B and 1 trillion dollars, and even if they spend that amount of money there's no guarantee they will be successful."
2021-05-15 16:34:30,stocks,"Can't say I've looked into them so far, but recycling is going to be a huge part of our future. I'm very convinced that in about 20 years or so, we will have a (nearly) closed loop for battery production.

It's funny you should mention it actually, but I was just listening to [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEbsojhAiQI) with the CEO of First Cobalt Corp, and he talked quite extensively about the recycling aspect of batteries. You might find that interesting.

As for what you said about your family member, I agree there will always be downsides to EVs. They're never going to be better in all aspects than an ICE vehicle, but they'll be (and quite honestly already are) a net positive."
2021-05-15 16:30:57,stocks,"Could be. Keep in mind that it's really not a big refit. Frames, steering, brakes, interior fittings stay 99% the same. Most EVs keep a 12V battery for that reason. Just to drive standard systems :) (that probably would not take well high-discharge jolts from a giant lipo bank)

Drivetrain is much simpler. It wouldn't cost much to just shut down parts of existing factories.

In my thinking, the reason they don't go full blast producing EVs is because the market couldn't absorb them rather than Nancy in accounting refusing to use a different type of printer.

Sales of SmokeWagens happen is many other places than the civilized and well developed states. Even in those. The infrastructure to support MASSIVE numbers of EVs is lacking. The power grid in some smaller towns probably couldn't even support charging EVs if all cars were suddenly electric.

Right now and for a few years to come at least, teslas and other EVs are just rich boy toys and intra-city commuters at best. Sure, you could use them for anything else, but on that logic you could also drive a heavy tank to the store to do your groceries. Could you do it? Yes. Would it be effective?

2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Risks regarding AMD? I wanted to hear your opinion about AMD. I am considering investing a large portion of my portfolio in AMD and have concerns about two specific risks:

If the mining boom slows down because the bubble has burst or something similar, I fear for the demand for graphics cards. I know it's rather partially dedicated mining cards used to mine, but to a large extent GPUs as well. Won't the used market for graphics cards then be flooded with cheap goods and the demand for new graphics cards collapse?

Also, many tech companies are starting to design their own chips, for example Apple, Microsoft and Amazon (the latter for their server business). And you can see from Apple's example that they are also very good at this.

How do you assess the two risks? Or can you think of other reasons not to buy AMD (or other chip designers)?"
2021-05-15 09:44:45,stocks,"While there is some risks for AMD with Amazon designing chips for AWS, the number of customers for AMD in the cloud and server space is quite large and so there is substantial diversification there. Large number of cloud providers won’t be able to design their own devices and ARM will never be 100% of the server market unlike the smartphone market. AMD is also well diversified into console gaming and IP licensing areas. See for example Samsung’s device using Vega. 

Regarding mining, I don’t think this is significantly material to AMD from downside risk since a bulk of the GPU business is in actual graphics use. This includes high end PC gaming, console gaming and yes also perhaps mobile gaming if Samsung’s plan comes to fruition. 

So overall risks to AMD are just the usual competitive pressures but given that the overall markets they are playing in continue to increase in size, as long as they execute they should be fine. 

Having worked in the chip industry for 25+ years there is not a whole lot of reasons not to buy into semiconductors. Semiconductor content in our lives continue to increase and while the players might change the overall industry is going to be growing and valuable over time. Just look at TI or STM or even INTC who have been around for 50 years and still going strong.

Just don’t bet more than you can afford to lose. AMD and others for that matter have struggled in the past on execution and so the stock might trade sideways or even down for a long time. 

But Dr Su has built a solid team now and hopefully these issues are in the past and won’t repeat again."
2021-05-15 09:48:33,stocks,"I don't think demand would collapse. For one most people clamoring to get a gpu won't want a burnout mining card

Second I don't see mining going anywhere anytime soon

Third amd has been consistent in crushing intel on gaming  and value in CPUs last year ish and probably will for a few more years. 

Fourth amd has been getting closer and closer to matching/beating Nvidia in gpus. 

So even if mining collapses amd still will probably keep taking more market share from Intel and Nvidia."

Source: own 400 shares and accumulating."
2021-05-15 11:36:42,stocks,"Reading other comments - I won’t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. 

Intel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. 

Hence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won’t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. 

Intel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. 

Also the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. 

As I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. 

Is NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. 

Now regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. 

And regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel’s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. 

Full disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them."
2021-05-15 11:02:37,stocks,"Long Intel but also have small position at AMD, both will continue to grow because of chip shortage .  AMD might be trading sideways short term and most like get affected if Fed raise interest rates.  Intel would have a higher payout in 5 years though, currently they are undervalued .  They do both fab and designing , AMD only does designing and rely on TSM for fab.  Intel also has one underrated component in their umbrella which is Mobileye who could eventually win the Lidar race because they get their chip directly with Intel."

2021-05-15 15:00:40,stocks,"AMD, to me, looks like it still has room to grow.

A few main events stood out to me which shouldn’t have been priced in / was unforeseen in the market.

1. Semiconductor Supply/Demand
I mean, there’s always been a high demand for this. But AMD’s stock shot up BEFORE we had a real issue in the supply sector. I remember back in August, we were talking a potential shortage of chips. Now a days, no one can get them. I drove past a dealership lot the other day and they had MAYBE 20% of cars in their lot. The demand won’t decrease anytime soon, and there’s only profit to be made in the sector. Their stock hasn’t necessarily increased all that much since then.

2. Console parts
I remember when the rumor was initially announced; Sony was ordering 50% more parts for their consoles, Microsoft could follow soon. Their stock? No increase. This was around October, when they were sitting around the $80 mark the whole time. This was a huge deal, considering they sold that much more product in the long run (over 4 years or so), but the stock never really fluctuated and only decreased throughout the month leading up to the announcement.

3. Killer earnings
They’ve been destroying earnings quarter after quarter, but their stock price never really reflects this. If they continue to increase at the current rate, I feel the next couple of earnings could be crucial to their valuation.

4. Market share from Intel
I remember just this last month when they posted a large market share increase from Intel within a quarter; this is without their mew Epyc processor line being released soon. I was very impressed with these statistics and could see a large growth in the field in the coming years. Getting people to switch over (from Intel to AMD) is the hardest part; staying with a company is relatively easy and requires little effort. 

5. Ideology of “Cyclical” Stocks
We see the rotation into cyclical stocks form growth stocks to keep with the pace of inflation. I believe we are nearing the age where cyclical stocks aren’t only classic necessities (energy, materials, food, etc), but also technological necessities. In my eyes, semiconductors are the number one technological necessity as we continue to progress into a technological age. Therefore, these semiconductor companies aren’t only a growth stock, but also becoming a cyclical one. The market may be pooling “tech stocks” together, keeping Apple, AMD, Microsoft, and a bunch of other NASDAQ companies, and therefore reduce positions in those companies upon their transition. However, we may come to a realization that semiconductors will function more as a cyclical stock in the near future, and see a rush of investors into the sector. I believe a portion of this has already started (last year), but more will follow."
2021-05-15 16:07:56,stocks,I'd argue their biggest risk if if Intel actually catches back up.
2021-05-15 16:32:34,stocks,Crypto bubble bursted?? We can’t have any GPU and it isn’t stopping..
2021-05-15 18:45:04,stocks,Eth2.0. The days of coin mining are numbered
2021-05-15 10:16:04,stocks,Intel got a new ceo recently who isn't a accountant. And at some point they will hit back hard and I don't want to be invested in amd when that happens
2021-05-15 10:20:00,stocks,You have to remember that due to crypto you cant count on whether they release good products or not. At this point I left anything to due with crypto till it calms down
2021-05-15 11:53:45,stocks,"Let me tell you what happened last time. First off, before the mining boom a couple years ago, everybody was moving to PC gaming because it was cheaper than consoles and had better graphics. There weren’t any price wars (aside from Nvidia dropping), just AMD pricing their performance comparable to Nvidia. People use GPUs for everything and still will now with artificial intelligence and gpu rendering for movies and whatnot. People will be happy to finally get cards MSRP. AMD is currently benefiting either way because of scalpers and people will continue to scalp consoles even if they can’t scalp gpus. When AMD/Nvidia start meeting true demand, scalpers started returning cards so people could upgrade their PCs and build clusters.

The nature of mining and crypto is mostly about decentralization, once gamers get their cards and possibly start dabbling in mining, the coins they mine will increase in value. My guess would be a perpetual boom bust for scalpers, but no change in revenue for anyone."
2021-05-15 12:01:26,stocks,"I would have invested a large chunk of my portfolio at 2-10$, back when it was a fraction of Intels marketcap, but now I think you're playing with fire at over 1/3rd given the limited potential upside.  Companies are stupid, they dont want AMD, if the two chips are priced the same they will buy Intel every time.

I would also be very afraid of cloud services, PaaS and SaaS can easily be made on ARM or RISCV processors.  You have stories of people being hacked and ransomwared every day, meanwhile there are a huge amount of companies running insecure Windows environments all over the globe, the shift will be quick to the cloud given how overwhelmingly terrible the alternative is.

I'd look at perhaps Kingsoft or Alibaba, China will have a large cloud market as well and they really wont want to be using an American company like Microsoft.  The writing is on the wall with that one I think."
2021-05-15 12:51:54,stocks,"Intel has about an 80% market share on the larger micro-processor market and AMD is barely breaking 10% market share and is rapidly growing. (admittedly, this might be semi-dated info)

Yes, a few key large players are designing their own microprocessors for the first time, but they aren't looking to capture the whole market as much as they are to supply their high-end devices under their brand only with limited hardware their brand uses.

This will be a larger issue for Intel, because it isn't cutting into AMD's share of the market, it is cutting into Intel's current market share.

The reason I'm not too concerned with these risks is because I see AMD has ample room to gain market share from Intel. Even if the Intel + AMD market share drops overall, there is still ample room for AMD to increase their individual market share overall.

AMD is profitable they have a P/E ratio in the mid-30s and room to improve over the next several years. This is a very attractive investment in a growth company with moderate risks for that portion of risk/reward of my portfolio.

They've also maintained revenue during short-term manufacturing cutbacks in the chip manufacturing sector, including from Taiwan Semiconductors that they rely on for manufacturing. When this issue is fully fixed, they will have more runway to grow revenue a couple of years out.

I'm long on AMD 340 shares."
2021-05-15 13:44:27,stocks,"> If the mining boom slows down because the bubble has burst or something similar, I fear for the demand for graphics cards. I know it's rather partially dedicated mining cards used to mine, but to a large extent GPUs as well. Won't the used market for graphics cards then be flooded with cheap goods and the demand for new graphics cards collapse?

Probably not, last time crypto collapsed that didn't happen. Graphics cards are prone to wear and tear especially under heavy workloads like crypto mining. Buying a used card is like buying a used car without knowing the car's history. You might get a good deal or you might get garbage. 

> Also, many tech companies are starting to design their own chips, for example Apple, Microsoft and Amazon (the latter for their server business). And you can see from Apple's example that they are also very good at this.

I wouldn't worry about it, the chips these companies are coming up with address a deficiency in the market for a particular product. Apple's chip is interesting and they have been working on it for a while but I don't expect to see it in non-Apple products. 

> How do you assess the two risks? Or can you think of other reasons not to buy AMD (or other chip designers)?

Long term my main concern is competition from Intel and Nvidia. Intel because it is massive and they are making massive investments in R&D. Nvidia because of the ARM acquisition and their position as a market leader in the GPU market."
2021-05-15 11:56:00,stocks,"The good:

1. AMD's growth numbers the last 2 years and forward guidance for this year are fantastic. 50% YoY revenue growth 2021. Margins are increasing.
2. AMD's products are superior to Intel. every single benchmark has AMD ahead, save in laptops, where Intel only breaks ahead by increased power consumption (75w vs 95w), which at some level is a threat to laptop battery life. If the preliminary reports are correct. Where performance matters (everywhere except laptops), sales numbers look good. Laptops dont look BAD, it is just that in a supply shortage AMD is prioritizing the highest margin sales.
3. As mentioned by others, the semiconductor market will continue to grow.
4. AMD is gaining market share in the expanding market. AMD has a large runway, a great deal of room to expand. It is entirely feasible to see AMD double its market share in CPUs in the next 1-3 years.
5. the PE of AMD is the lowest it has been in 3 years.

The risks

1. AMD stock has held at present levels for 10 months now. AMD has traded sideways in growth for up to a year and a half before (2018), but its hard to believe that in face of such sound fundamentals AMD stock does not eventually respond.
2. I agree with other posters that in the short term there might be more pain due to the inflation storyline.
3.  Because of the strained semiconductor market, it is unclear to big investors at revenue levels just how big AMD's edge is over intel. Intel's revenues remain strong because demand is so high. That demand is forecasted to drop, which is one reason why investors are leery of the huge numbers posted this last quarter (stimmy bumps). If AMD has strong numbers relative to intel in the next 2 quarters (6 months) I have to imagine even the most cautious investor has to realize that AMD's edge is enough. Having bought computers for 15 years, I can say with relative confidence that AMD's performance benchmarks are sufficiently good that even previously loyal intel customers are now looking at AMD. I am one of those who has flipped. My opinion is not the market's, and revenues are more important than sentiment. I believe the revenues will come, but for the next 3-6 months maybe intel continues to hold up in the eyes of investors who are used to the story of intel being king.

Why I am optimistic in face of the risks

1. I think the inflation story is overblown. I think inflation numbers are due in large part to supply shortages at all levels due to covid. Shipping costs and time are dramatically higher. raw materials are out of stock and are more expensive to purchase. Semiconductors are in short supply, and companies which would like to be producing in their factories (car manufacturers) are idling plants. People are buying more than there is inventory, not because of stimulus checks but because of global rampdowns last year taking effect. The price increases on basic things is passed down to the consumer, but eventually the market will equilibrate to the new demand.
2. The Economy is growing. In the last month I have been struck by the sheer number of signs advertising that companies are hiring. This says to me that companies expect and are ramping up. I suppose it is true that after this pandemic many workers no longer think fast food and retail jobs are worth super low salaries, but that is not a terrible thing. The outcome will be more dollars in workers pockets, which is only inflation (to me) if: A, worker salaries are a primary cost in the bottom line of these companies, which I doubt, given McDonald's effortless ability to raise their minimum wage; or B, minimum wage workers start having so much extra cash that they stop bargain hunting, which seems unlikely to me. The minimum wage earners I know are delaying health care and car maintenance and other large expenditures because they are struggling to make ends meet. They are not purchasing toys for kids, they are certainly not buying clothes at 25% markups.
3. Crypto will continue to be around in the short term, but even without it computers and gaming consoles are becoming more and more ubiquitous.
4. AMD has the better tech for the next 5 years."

AMD knows design, TSM knows fab, sounds and acts like a great partnership but that doesn't mean they'd be a great company under one set of management. Right now that's Intel's issue and if you're long you better be sure that you believe their management can handle the reorg of both fab and dev.

Buffett diversifies some, but his point has always been that if you see something truly great, don't dabble. Go for it.

Is AMD that good of a company? Tough to say. Its products are beating out Intel, and it appears it will do so for the next 5 years. With regard to nvda, no data so far points to nvda taking serious gains away from the cpu field. On the contrary, amd seems to be making inroads to gpu territory. 

Crypto is a good sector for AMD but even without it more of the world is getting desktops and laptops. And moreso, data centers are hosting content for mobile users. 

Nothing in life is certain. The next 5 years look about as good as one could hope to project however.

A single stock can swing negative faster than the market, but it can also swing very positive. The market will not gain 25% per year for 10 years. Good companies can. Based on pe ratio, growth prospects, products,  and company/leadership reputation I honestly can't think of many surer bers than amd.

Eventually the weight like the intrinsic value will withstand the test of time."
2021-05-15 15:31:43,stocks,"> It is foolish to believe we can predict that an online book store can be the leading cloud provider 20 years later.

I love when people use amazon as the go to example for their counterarguments ignoring things like google, apple, or Microsoft which have remained within their same sectors for their entire existence, been big names throughout, and done insanely well barring microsoft under balmer. But yeah, use the book store argument because it makes things seem ridiculous. If you wanted to make a better counterargument, I recommend intel, GE, or a number of dot com era companies which were on top of the world before stagnating/declining.

As I alluded to, I would never encourage a retail investor concentrate their wealth in a single stock, although 5-10 really good stocks that you regularly keep tabs on and research thoroughly can do wonders. There is a such thing as over diversification."

Any insight would be appreciated! I'd pay to use their services if they are actually usable...

\- HOWEVER, doing some google searching, they do arbitrarily put out reports (very recent). My question is WTF is going on with their website/services. I am pretty much saying ""take my money!"" :) but can't figure out what this company is doing (vis-a-vis their online presence)

January 1999, 60 Minutes interview (https://www.you----.com/watch?v=Yv8MrBBuRqI)

(00:21): “... and where is Amazon’s headquarters? … 1516 Second Avenue… We didn’t see anything that looked vaguely cutting edge… Upstairs, it doesn’t look very high-tech, either. More like a college dorm than a corporate headquarters. And then there’s the boss; you generally hear him before you see him… you can afford a better desk than that… and you don’t need clean carpets.”

(06:08): “Is this investing or this gambling?”

“Right now, with the frenzy we’ve had, to me, it feels much more like gambling.”

“Because it’s crazy?”

“I don’t find it to be rational, to be honest with you.”

“But investors keep flooding in. Why? Amazon snagged almost 2 million new customers at the end of last year. And like other internet companies, it’s growing much faster than those old blue chips.”

Recent interview with Jeff Bezos (https://www.you----.com/watch?v=hwskqpf0E6Y)

“Most of those companies of the dotcom era are out of business. You survived. What was it that made you to survive and virtually the rest of them are gone?”

Jeff: “Well, that whole period is very interesting, because the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock. So, as I watch the stock fall from 113 to 6, I was also watching all of our internal business metrics. Number of customers, profit per unit, umm, you know, everything you could imagine; defects, etc. Every single thing about the business was getting better - and fast.”

===== ===== =====

The biggest change comes with WISH’s increase in logistics revenue (revenue from facilitating delivery of product). Info found in most recent quarterly report, link as above:

Three months ended March 31 (in millions USD: 2020 / 2021):

Logistics revenue: $56 / $245 (increased 337%)

Marketplace revenue: $384 / $527 (increased 37%)

Revenue: $440 / $772 (increased 75.5%)

Overview of Wish Local, which is part of its increase in logistics revenue: https://www.you----.com/watch?v=WBkP2FtSq00

Wish Local might seem like Amazon’s ability to deliver to post offices and other pickup locations, but a key difference is that Wish Local allows the pickup locations (retailers) themselves to sell their wares via the Wish App and to carry popular items from Wish, earning a commission on in-person sales.

Conclusion: I don’t know… what are your thoughts?!

Disclosure: I own 80 shares of $WISH at a cost basis of $16.70 per share (yes, bagholder… am wondering if it’d be worth it to average down? Fuggedaboutit or FUGGEDABOUTIT?)."
2021-05-15 12:10:20,stocks,"$6B market cap with $3.19B revenues on the low side expected for 2021. Trading at less than 2 times 2021 sales with 20-25% annual growth rate for 2022. Super undervalued business. Facebook tried to buy the company early on. Amazon and Alibaba tried to buy Wish after 5 years it was in business. Peter Theil is an investor, executive management team includes Jacqueline Reses (square, alibaba, social capital hedosophia, Pershing square tontine), Rajat Bahri (Kraft, Trimble), Pai Liu (Airbnb), and CEO who worked at Google."
2021-05-15 09:49:11,stocks,"If you believe in the management and the company, average down and hold til next earnings and see if the net profit improves. If you aren’t confident in their ability to grow, dump it."
2021-05-15 13:08:00,stocks,"$wish is an okay company at a dirt cheap price. It’s logistics operations and team give it the potential to turn into a great company in time. 

At less that 2x price to sales I’d buy this hand over first vs an Etsy that was trading recently at 15x. And before the Etsy bulls come out, I think Etsy at present is a better company. It’s just Etsy at a 20bn mcap is just much less appealing than Wish at $6bn. 

My PT is $21."
2021-05-15 08:52:20,stocks,"Thanks for all these numbers.

I am going with ETSY then. At least they have some niche in handcrafted market and doing good.

Wish has niche in cheap Asia-made  knock-offs which takes 3 weeks to arrive, giving you something that u haven't exactly ordered and bad costumer service when time to complain"
2021-05-15 15:03:28,stocks,"You are calculating value/visit but how much profit or even revenue does wish generate per visit? Most clearly way below Amazon or any other portal as they sell cheap stuff basically. How will their profit margins be? 
Very hard call"
2021-05-15 11:00:20,stocks,"IMO it is worth a .25-1% stake of my portfolio. People love cheap stuff, Wish has great ratings, people accept that what they're getting might be dodgy but they're still using the platform. It's worth noting that active user revenue almost doubled year over year, user growth increased y/y, they seem to have management who are experienced in the industry. I think of Wish as dollar store/5 below. They're also mostly outside of the US and at this price point, I think that they're a viable exposure to emerging markets and to US low cost consumer discretionary. Sure they have competition from Ali and Sea, but I own those too, in higher proportions.  I'd like to see them maintain revenue with less advertising spending. Hopefully management is working on user retention and user revenue growth. I'm probably wrong though. No idea how to value them appropriately, as I am retsrded."
2021-05-15 08:49:22,stocks,"if your only dd is ""look wish could be the next amazon"", its a pretty bad dd"
2021-05-15 18:28:28,stocks,"Bad side in 1Q report is the increase of logistic costs. As their shipments are coming mostly from Asia, its caused by overall increase of shipping prices from Asia. When this demand settles down(lackof containers ends) they can even make profit."
2021-05-15 09:45:51,stocks,"wish is SO TRASH ITS UNREAL. Yeah you visit the site perhaps, but if you buy anything from you have to be so so desperate. You dont even have to look at the numbers and see this company is gonna be worth absolutely nothing"
2021-05-15 09:09:22,stocks,Puts...many many puts
2021-05-15 13:15:10,stocks,Compare Wish and Etsy’s their price-to-sales ratio’s
2021-05-15 13:35:17,stocks,Never realized before but I guess Etsy also sells a bunch of junk nobody actually needs just like Wish. I’m just not willing to pay 20 x sales for Etsy when Wish will likely offer better return for shareholders with less risk in the valuation.
2021-05-15 09:19:29,stocks,So does Ali express and alibaba??? People want cheaper versions of a lot of different products. Wish is obviously doing something right if they are increasing their profits.
2021-05-15 12:13:07,stocks,"That is why Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba all tried to buy it out? There is a market and Wish serves it."
2021-05-15 13:35:25,stocks,"Keep in mind, that a large portion of their customer base is outside the United States."
2021-05-15 13:36:27,stocks,"Yes I know. Wish can be good short term flip play. But in a longer term Etsy has more chances of thriving, so can be ok to pay a higher price for a longer term hold."
2021-05-15 15:45:02,stocks,Yeah at least WISH has a diverse bunch of junk catering to a wider range of people than ETSY.
2021-05-15 13:37:55,stocks,Theres a market for crack as well doesnt mean you should invest in it. The company is dogshit their products are shit and sells it like its flowers. That conpany will not last.
2021-05-15 13:44:59,stocks,"!remindme 1 year

I’m guessing you’re not familiar with Wish’s logistics operations their key moat. Look at that related 337% revenue increase in OP’s post. Good luck with the play and all but don’t dismiss $wish because it doesn’t have $etsy’s sexiness. I consider it more interesting both short and long term."
2021-05-15 13:57:18,stocks,"Lol..... Well, I made close to $4300 on the 3200 shares I bought on Thursday and early Friday, so at least shit pays.  I agree with you that a lot of stuff on their site is trash, but there is stuff that's reasonably good as well.  Most people understand that quality is sacrificed for a lower price, and don't expect their $3.50 pair of tennis shoes to last as long as a $60 pair of Nikes.  They're actually doing a much better job weeding out garbage than just a few years ago, but have a ways to go.

Amazon at one point offered 10 billion for the business.  One mans trash is another's treasure, all about perspective my friend."
2021-05-15 14:49:03,stocks,HEy you can make money on any shit company so why not wish. everything is possible. just saying the company is utter trash

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 17th, 2021.

# **Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/earnings-reports-the-fed-will-test-the-market-rally-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead, as major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar.
*****
> The Federal Reserve may also play a role. Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday, and after April’s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation, market pros will watch it closely.
*****
> Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday.
*****
> Stocks have been volatile. The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week’s heavy losses. The defensive consumer staples, financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors. The worst performers were consumer discretionary, off about 3.7% for the week, and tech, which was down 2.2%.
*****
> Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday’s rally, up about 2.1%. Energy was the best performer, up more than 3%.
*****
> “Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s not like the things that spooked us this week, like inflation, are going away...I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive.” He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts.
*****
> But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.
*****
> Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic, like airlines and hotels, are ready to rise off the bottom.
*****
> He is still concerned about the tech sector, which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care.
*****
> # Fed Ahead
> The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting. But that was held before April’s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4.2% year over year.
*****
> That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266,000 payrolls, a quarter of what was expected.
*****
> “I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points. They’re thinking that one data point is not a trend,” said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America.
*****
> But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying. That would be a precursor to slowly ending the $120 billion a month asset purchase program, and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates.
*****
> Hogan said when the weak employment report was released, the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer.
*****
> But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday.
*****
> “We saw hot CPI, hot PPI,” said Hogan, referring to the producer price index. “That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve.”
*****
> The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation, but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market. But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper, down nearly 2% for the week.
*****
> # Retail earnings and housing
> Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week. Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday. Target, TJX and Lowe’s release results Wednesday, and B.J.’s Wholesale and Kohl’s on Thursday.
*****
> Another disappointing data point was Friday’s April’s retail sales, which came in flat with March. But they are still at a high level. Hogan said based on the sales report, retailers should have done well.
*****
> “You’re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming. It used to be Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe’s,” said Hogan. He said now others have joined the list, like TJX and Gap, and should do well.
*****
> Besides earnings, there is housing data. The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday, and housing starts are published Tuesday. Existing home sales will be issued on Friday.
*****
> Hogan said depending on the data, it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week. He noted that D.R. Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week.
*****
> “The home building index is off 5% for the week, even with it being up 1% [Friday]. This is a red-hot sector that has lots of implications,” he said. “What’s good for home sales is good for auto sales. It’s good for Home Depot and Lowe’s.”
*****
> Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday.
*****
> Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3Live.com, said by the end of the week, some of the growth and tech names were trading better, like Facebook and Alphabet.
*****

> # 5 Charts We Are Watching

> Last week’s monthly nonfarm payroll was disappointing, but it usually takes a long time for jobs to come back after a recession, so maybe we shouldn’t have been so surprised. In fact, looking at the 10 previous recessions, it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost. Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time, we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre-COVID-19.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly. “Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break, falling more than 16% into the summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We don’t expect that type of a pullback this time, but after an 89% rally, maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Copper is breaking out to new highs after consolidating for 15 years. The last time it did that it eventually gained more than 150%. Every time is different, but with the global economy soaring back and demand for copper not ending anytime soon, we expect this industrial metal to continue to lead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> We also keep an eye on the presidential cycle. We are now past President Biden’s first 100 days and choppy action with a new President in Office is perfectly normal right about now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> The financial press has discussed the well-known “sell in May and go away” market saying, but did you know it actually starts on May 5th? As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins. The calendar, you could say, isn’t doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is.

> # NASDAQ 100 Finds Support

> Our go to leading market index indicator of late, the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000. Actually, using our wide chisel-tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000-13200 range on the accompanying chart.

> While we still do not expect any major decline here, we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months – the Worst Six Month of the year May-October. We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken, Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week.

> We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical “Reposition in May” period. The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent-up pandemic demand.

> Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November-June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns. Though, we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000.

> If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September/October lows around 12900 and 12750, which would be an 8-9% pullback from the April 16 14041.91 closing Doji candle high. Below that are the March lows 12200-12420 which would be an 11-13% correction.

> In our view all the stimulus, pent-up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft, while seasonals, valuations, technicals, internals, sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall. Please enjoy a more normal summer.

> # Door is Open For Developed International Stocks

> We’ve warmed up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons. For one, the U.S. stock market has staged a tremendous rally—this week notwithstanding—since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren’t pricing in so much optimism. Valuations, though not great timing tools, are more attractive in Europe and Japan. And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non-US stock returns.

> Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks. The developed international equity market (mainly Europe and Japan) is much more value-focused than the U.S. market, based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S&P 500 Index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U.S. In other words, international tends to work when value works.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “Should strong performance by value stocks continue—and we suspect it might—international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance,“ explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials, industrials and natural resources, coupled with tech sector weakness, gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U.S. as those economies fully reopen.”

> We can see how developed international stocks are more value-focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes. As shown in the graphic below, the U.S. equity market (represented by the S&P 500 Index) has a much higher technology sector allocation, making it a more growth-oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities. If digital media (think Google and Facebook, which are categorized as communication services) and e-commerce (think Amazon, which is in consumer discretionary) are included in this sector comparison, the technology gap widens even further. In essence, for international to outperform, U.S. technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value. That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic. As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U.S. is seeing now, those markets may be in an even better position to outperform. Until then, we maintain our slight preference for U.S. stocks over developed international.

> # Bullish Sentiment Down Big

> The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months, and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action. Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill, dropping 7.8 percentage points to 36.5%. Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi-year high at 56.9%, this week's reading was the lowest since the last week of October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull.png))**

> The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22.73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th, 2018. In the table below, we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year. Overall, they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S&P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm. One and three months later have both seen the S&P 500 trade higher 81.8% of the time and a half year to a full-year out has seen the index lower only one time (in 2007). Additionally, each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S&P 500 trading higher across all time frames.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull-Table-b.png))**

> With bullish sentiment lower, bearish sentiment gained 3.9 percentage points. At 27%, it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bear.png))**

> That has resulted in the bull-bear spread dropping 11.7 points to 9.5. That is the first single-digit reading in the spread since the first week of February, but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly, neutral sentiment is flying. After gaining another 4 percentage points this week, neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020. Similar to bullish sentiment, the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years.

> # ""Inflation"" Trends

> You know it's getting bad when inflation starts to trend on Twitter, but that's where we find ourselves this morning with the terms '#GasShortage2021' and '#inflation' both trending on our Twitter feed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-twitter.png))**

> On Google, the frequency of searches for the term inflation looks like it's on its own path straight to the moon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-trends.png))**

> These real-time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the 'official' inflation data this morning as y/y CPI surged to 4.2%, eclipsing the prior post-financial crisis highs. Not only that, but if CPI is unchanged on a m/m basis in May (highly unlikely), the y/y reading will climb to 4.3% given the decline last May. If we assume that May's m/m change is the same as the average so far this year, it would imply a 4.8% y/y change.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-2010.png))**

> Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m/m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point. That's because the rate of increase on a m/m basis has now accelerated for six straight months. Going all the way back to the 1940s there's never been a streak that long. Just for some perspective, if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April, headline CPI will clock in at 5.1%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-InflationStreaks.png))**

> While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post-financial crisis period, from a longer-term perspective, it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty-year range. Based on the pain from prior spikes, let's hope it stays that way.

> # Small Businesses Growingly Concerned About Inflation

> In today's Morning Lineup, we covered some of the details of this morning's release of the NFIB's monthly survey on small business sentiment. The survey showed rising prices, tight labor market conditions, and overall improving demand.

> The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues. For the majority of businesses, cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent. In total, 64% of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem. Meanwhile, the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand. One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from 'big business'. Only 7% of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017. While up 1 percentage point in April, cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade. While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April, inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses. 6% of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013.Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

That advice always bothers me. Historically the May-October months have a much lower gain than November-April. But it's still a gain you'll miss out on if you're in cash all summer.

But watch for signs of a correction, there are usually a couple during the summer and early fall. Be prepared to ride it out if your crystal ball doesn't tell you when to sell/buy."

My LL sold our home of 4 years. Been paying 1350. 

Was hunting for a new rental and every place was getting scooped up fast... I mean fast! Our home sold in 4 or 5 days.... currently in the process of moving. Secured a lease for a shit house that's about 40% smaller, no garage  or any of the cool stuff we have at our current location. And about 500$ more per month.

Every rental had 40+ pending applications. We lucked out and got this place, however, I feel this new LL will be a fun one to deal with. Potential mold problem is a big issue. The Grouting on back splashes are all crumbled and exposing the inside of the walls, bathrooms both have failing caulking on and around the bath tubs. One spot has a 4 cm by 1cm hole into the wall, exposed drywall near the vent.

During the walk through I made notice of these concerns.

Also the place was dirty... cob webs everywhere, can see mudslides through the paint, the hood is over the stove is nasty and filled with grease, blinds are dusty and gross, strong evidence of indoor smoking.

I've also taken video and pics of all of the potential health issues. After 3 weeks I finally heard from maintenance,  who simply said, ""let's meet next week, have a good weekend"". After emailing 3 times about these issues.

Nearly every corner where the ceiling meets the walls are cracked, can see the mud tape in many spots, it's just shit.

I have a feeling I'll eventually be able to break this lease legally w/o repercussion.

2021-05-15 09:54:46,stocks,Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG)
2021-05-15 14:10:45,stocks,"Very sorry about your loss. This pandemic has taken too much away from us. 

I don't know the fraction of your portfolio you intend to apply here, but if it's anything more than a few percent I'd just chuck it into a market fund and call it a day. If you're asking us, you probably shouldn't be touching individual stocks. Don't listen to us maniacs.

But... If I had to choose a single company with growth in mind and personal conviction, I'd probably put it in BJ, which I am long on. Now obviously, in this case, it's not growth if you define that as having a tech element. However, this company has four key attributes that, I believe, set it up like a growth company in the 10-year horizon:

1. A small market capitalization with about 1/4 Costco's market share in stores, 1/10 Costco's bottom-line, and 1/30 Costco's market cap. 

2. A holding company's management that hammers in the motive to expand into new territory (growth) and facilitate online shopping and curbside pickup.

3. A top-heavy, speculative total capitalization structure (i.e., they have a lot of longterm debt). This means as far as investments go, it is risky. They have to pay interest on the debt and that eats into their operating margins, which eats into metrics like EPS. This can actually be a *good* thing, because expenses on these debts are relatively static while operating profits are variable. If they make 1 million this year, owe 500k in interest, then 500k goes to the shares. If the next year they make 1.5 million, they may still owe 500k in interest, but now 1 million goes to the shares. A 50% increase in operating profit, but 100% increase in earnings for common. The fear, obviously, is that they fail to meet obligations and default on their loans. Thus far, they've done well in keeping up payments, and they regularly turn a profit. Still, high risk, especially with interest rates expected to rise soon.

4. Secondary issue nature due to regionality. Growth onto the national scale in, say, 10 years would likely be coincident with a three-fold increase in outlets and, presuming profitability holds, at least a three-fold increase in market capitalization. National-scale recognition could magnify this. Note that the debt in point 3 supports the managements' notions as to expansion.

A final note: I would hesitate buying it at this instant. It has had a strong run-up since last earnings, and the next QR is next week. Price is near alltime high and valuations are touching a little too high IMO. Projections are for EPS shrinkage due to people coming out of pandemic isolation, which could drop the price. Further, their CEO recently died unexpectedly, which throws a wrench in things. And finally, I think there is the potential for a market correction in the coming months. If that happens, the price could plummet. It fell almost 7% earlier this week when we had that inflation selloff. 

Still, just put it in a market fund, bit by bit, over time. For all my ramblings I'm an idiot in the end. Like a casino, the house (market) always wins. Good luck."

\- Genomics/biotech (mix of ARKG holdings and other stocks. I hold some CRSP, PACB, ABCL)

**PLTR** and **ABCL** are pretty high conviction stocks for me.

I'll be honest though, they're not clear value plays in the short run. Valuations are all pretty bloated, though less than in January when I bought most of my stocks. Then again with a 10 year horizon you will see a good return for many of these stocks even at current prices (if you're disciplined enough not to panic sell).

2021-05-15 11:59:13,stocks,"First, look at the top ten holdings for something like vti/voo, they are faang.
Second, consider that the S&P tracks the top stocks, so whatever companies are “disrupted” will drop off of that listing (before going to zero) and be replaced by said disruptors. Tesla is a solid recent example. You might miss out on the massive initial spike in those companies... but you are in a safer investment vehicle that is most likely and historically still going to give decent returns. And it’s not nearly as concentrated or risky.
I don’t necessarily disagree with your take on disruption. Just from an investing standpoint, you have to be quite knowledgeable and IMO frankly quite lucky with your picks to succeed at telling the future essentially. Which one of the million fintech startups will win? Etc etc"

Over the long-term, outperformance comes from being correct about a non-consensus view. There’s nothing more consensus than tech and high expectations are already reflected in tech multiples.

A boring tobacco stock like MO is up over 23% YTD, and I’ll bet that it outperforms the S&P 500 technology sector over the next decade, and certainly ARKK. I would make a similar bet on large cap pharma."
2021-05-15 16:08:19,stocks,"They may be disrupted by the tech but not necessarily the tech companies that currently exist. For example, it's hard to think of a tech more disruptive than computers, but look at how many computer companies from the late 70s/early 80s still exist and are doing well. Another is cars, but look at how many car companies existed when they were coming into fruition that didnt exist 20 years later. Just because a tech is the future doesnt mean the companies currently representing it are. In fact, as a whole, companies who represent cutting edge tech tend to underperform the market. Some companies excel, but many many more underperform and go bankrupt enough the bring the field as a whole down.  

As for myself, I actually underweight S&P companies in my index portfolio, I do 1/3 large cap, 1/3 large cap value, and 1/3 small cap value. Small cap value actually consistently outperforms the S&P by a significant margin in a way that has a theoretical explanation, which is why I overweight it."

Google owns K12 and have not done anything yet to really monetize.

Another great example with Google is Android.  Google continues to offer for free even though there is basically no competition.

So Google could easily add a couple dollar license fee and have a couple of billion in new revenue with basically no expense.

Google is starting to monetize one of their assets starting next month with Google Photos.    Been giving unlimited for free and now will start charging.

So that removes a multi billion dollar expense and will now be adding new cloud revenue.

Google has really been just growing so fast they just have not really need to focus on better monetizing the assets they have.   Last quarter Google for example increased profits by well over 100% YoY.

2021-05-15 16:07:08,stocks,"""It would be easy to beat the market if only you picked the winners"" says captain hindsight.

There's multiple studies against active management. One example is [Why Indexing Works](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2673262). Trying to beat an index by picking specific companies in the index increases chance of underpermance vs that index. 

Really depends on time horizon too as I'm more focused on the super long term. Trying to pick winners vs an index over a 20 year or greater time period is just a bad 'long term financial decision', key phrase in my gripe here. Especially in growth stocks whose prices by definition are held up by speculation and uncompensated risk from surprise news. Betting on unknowns to carry your gains isn't a strong prior probability for a long term investment."

2021-05-15 16:01:12,stocks,"I answered the literal question you posed, so I don't think I missed any point. And at any rate, even if every company somehow morphs into a tech hybrid -- which I seriously doubt -- then it'll be the specific sub industries that guide price movements, rendering a generic statement like ""invest in tech""  borderline meaningless. You're also getting very far away from the actual topic of this thread, which is investing in a *retirement* account. The whole point of investing in a retirement account is minimizing volatility and maximizing compounding returns. That's why SPY over time (actual long term, like 30-40 years) outperforms most all sector plays.  It's fine you're very bullish on tech.  I'm personally bullish on it too. I do recognize the bear case as valid though, which is that tech is currently in a bubble divorced from any rational valuations, but long term I'm bullish. It doesn't really make a difference when talking about this type of investing. Of course the less diversified and more narrow you get, the more potential you have to maximize returns. You also have more potential to maximize losses. That's counter to the goal of a retirement account, and that's counter to the goal of SPY. What you see as ""bad"" stocks holding the SPY back are actually what gives it stability. There's a lot of factors that could tank tech. We just don't know."
2021-05-15 16:18:16,stocks,So you disagree with Cathie?
2021-05-15 16:21:41,stocks,"Cathie herself readily admits her type of investing is risk-loving, built around very specific goals, and should not be copied by everyone. She's also not infallible -- she's had some very strong returns, but the sample size is small and doesn't mean much of anything when talking about a retirement timeline."
2021-05-15 16:23:12,stocks,Well she also says index funding is in a bubble due to the lack of price discovery with people passively just allocating capital to companies that don’t deserve it. Burry says the same.
2021-05-15 16:30:36,stocks,"And that's very possible. The large indexes have crashed before. Doesn't change the fact that on an actual long-term timeline, they tend to win out. It also doesn't change the fact that one could make a very strong argument that almost *every* asset is in a bubble right now. In fact, that's pretty much Burry's thesis. It also doesn't change the fact that speculative tech startups are one of the single largest sources of the very same reckless capital allocation you're referring to in your bear case against indexes. 


In the context of a retirement account, the point isn't to argue about what's going to crash or what's going to rise in the next decade --- you're always going to find very logical arguments on both sides of that. The point is to talk about risk mitigation so that the account can grow over a period of multiple decades. The more diverse your investments, the less risk. That's just a simple mathematical fact, and it'll always hold true."
2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,"is ZM gonna collapse further, now that the stay-at-home period is coming to an end? ZM started at around $100 pre covid.

Went as high as $588, and now sits around $300. I think it will eventually fall back below $150.

What does the company have to prop up these prices?

People are going back to the office soon, and I'm guessing only a fraction of those people will continue to use Zoom. 

Some people might be overestimating how much of the work force will be permanently working from home. Companies are probably not going to suddenly give up their real estate.

Zoom's 2020 growth can't be extrapolated into future years.

Zoom isn't the only video conferencing player out there, so what's so special about it? People were using Cisco and Google Meet or Hangouts before this.

&#x200B;

Motley fools tried to pump ZM on March 16 as it was falling, when it was at $350, and since then it has fallen 23% to $270 the last few days.

Why are you going long, or shorting ZM ?"
2021-05-15 07:29:45,stocks,"While the peak of remote working is behind us for the short term, the trend is definitely in that direction so I wouldn't be so quick to assume that everyone is going back to the office now.

That said, Zoom has zero moat. My company is still working remotely, and we ditched zoom very early on in the lockdowns - first to try Microsoft Teams, and then Google Meet which we stuck with.

My problem with Zoom is the same one I have with Dropbox. Their entire product offering is competing with products that are an add-on to ecosystems which companies likely already use.

If a company is using Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure or any of the numerous Google services, why would they continue to use a separate cloud storage/video conferencing application which does nothing special?

As to your question; long term I would expect Zoom to go down a lot more. But for now we're still in the the free money era, so lofty overvaluations may persist for some time yet."
2021-05-15 04:16:47,stocks,"They are currently a one product company. They need to change that and I believe the management will shift in that direction.

2021-05-15 11:44:05,stocks,the pandemic transformed the industry. i can't remember the last time a recruiter contacted me and didn't pitch 'remote forever'.
2021-05-15 13:59:05,stocks,Zoom's market is limited against a Microsoft Teams based world. Think of Zoom as Netscape Navigator on the 2020s.
2021-05-15 15:27:00,stocks,"I'm going to go against the grain and say that Zoom is here to stay and grow. These are my reasons why.

1. Zoom has a unique (and overlooked) economic moat with a high barrier of entry. <100ms latency during vid conferencing is an impressive technology, and a very expensive one to replicate from competitors. There's a reason why Slack couldn't enter the video conferencing market, or why Microsoft has taken forever in integrating Skype into Teams (and brought subpar results compared to Zoom imo), even though they acquired Skype years ago.
2. They are no longer a 1-product company. Zoom Phone is expanding Zoom's TAM beyond the video communications market to the broader telecommunications market, and they are also offering other solutions such as their App Marketplace to enhance the Zoom experience and ecosystem.
3. Their CAGR over the next 3 years is projected at roughly 30% per year, which is right around the ballpark of some Reddit darling stocks such as CRWD, NET, and PLTR. Zoom actually has the lowest EV/Sales & EV/EBITDA Ratios out of ALL of them right now (disclosure I own all 4).
4. In addition, there's another commonly used metric called ""the Rule of 40"", to evaluate growing SaaS companies. Simply put, the Rule of 40 = Revenue Growth + EBITDA Margin, and if the sum is > 40, it's typically a SaaS company worth investing in. Zoom's is off the charts at 117%  (107% revenue growth + 10% EBITDA margin).
5. Lastly, I don't think WFH is going to go away forever. As much as there are people who are itching to return to work, there are people who want to work remotely as long as they can. We're already seeing big tech companies offer continued remote work, and a I think it's likely that a hybrid of in-office and remote work will become the norm. This is enough for Zoom to continue to grow at the 30% CAGR pace I mentioned above.

&#x200B;

Of course, all of these arguments for the stock price will remain irrelevant if the market continues to decline and multiples contract for growth stocks. But overall, I believe Zoom is a strong company and is often too easily overlooked by many retail investors - and I don't mind adding more when it's sub-$300."
2021-05-15 11:28:45,stocks,"Tech exec here. Zoom is more than just a meeting software that most people aren't aware of. It's instant messaging is simple and easy to use, their hosted phone platform is just as good if not better than Microsoft's, and their integration partner network continues to grow without alienating it's competition. 

I think it comes down but don't count them out, they are capitalizing where they can while they are a household name.

Edit: I have no positions but am a Zoom customer at the enterprise level. Also a Cisco and MS customer."

2021-05-15 10:48:41,stocks,"I want to see them making some serious acquisitions to justify their valuation. They reported amazing earnings but their stock has been tanking since. Investors are realizing all the growth is already priced in and sell the stock. I'm talking about buying Dropbox or something like that.

ZM to the 100s in time"
2021-05-15 12:44:07,stocks,"Yes, regardless if remote work remains, ZM price will continue to drop.  It has no moat.  Numerous large tech companies already offer the same  product for free (Microsoft Teams, Google meet, etc...).

2021-05-15 12:52:12,stocks,"Zoom 2021 revenue is expected to be $3.7-4.5B. It’s at a realistic valuation at its current price, they still expect to grow 20% in 2023. It will probably get added to the S&P 500 by then, after posting profit for 4 consecutive quarters there is nothing stopping it. I hated on Zoom and it’s valuation over the last year but it is probably going to stay. Same criticisms about how it is not a unique product or service and the level of competition can be said about companies like Spotify and Peloton."
2021-05-15 12:56:17,stocks,"Theres a lot of office spaces that are currently empty that I'm not sure will be filled anytime soon. Companies that can work virtually save a ton of money.  Theres housing and land grabs going on but office space is cheap. 100 govt stipend going out for a new tablet, laptop, or computer and a month of internet because theres still a need and rhey recognize that.  

I'm not saying zoom has the same growth rate in front of it and I dont own it personally. But it's not a guaranteed assumption that these companies recoil to precovid production levels either. The world has changed forever, citizen and company needs change with them.  Expecting things to go back to the way they were is the only assumption we can guarantee is wrong."

lots of other companies do the same.  overall companies realized that they didn´t lose the amout of efficiency they were fearing or was projected. instead, they got more satisfied workforces, less costs for office spaces and got motre attractive for new hires. 

no. office space will not come back on the same level as it was before. 

BUT, with MSFT aggressively pushing their Office products (which has a full fledged VideoConferencing software which is way more integrated than any other VC software ever will be) and I do not see any real lofty gals for ZM.

I didn’t see any mention on how zoom is verbiage now though. It sounds trivial, but I think that that speaks volumes of its own. It was so widely used, and in particular, by the middle aged-older adults that it has now become purely associated with any video conferencing. “Hey want to zoom later?”. That’s what I mean. 

I really believe in this company because of that, it’s growth, the Covid catalyst, and I really think it can grow into a big tech player. It just needs to expand to other functionality as other posters have mentioned. Specifically, I want it to integrate task managing and messenger features, similar to Slack.

An awful lot of people find WFH to be better. If 30% would actually *quit*, that tells me that there is going to be considerable pressure to allow for it.

2021-05-15 14:08:49,stocks,"as far as I understand, the whole comms tech under the hood is basically still skype for business. but they overhauled the complete codec package, the UI and their server infrastructure.  

in the old days, to get skype for business working great, you had to have your own on prem server. no all you need is a M365 account. no server needed. modern cloud architecture does the rest. 

we use it, our customers (which are signficantly larger than us) use, my GF´s company (extremely large US Based corporation) uses it. it works. 

and it gets updates almost weekly. Teams is much much more than just a VC software. 

it integrates project oriented workspaces , file storage , all MS office applications and offers ton os plugins to implement all kinds of tools and products directly in the TEams client. 

the main reason teams is much better than ZM is not necessarily the video conferencing tech,. but the integration into a modern workday and the applications needed for it. 

I could work all day in Teams and wouldnt have to open any other application all day. 

I wouldn´t even need anything isntalled on my pc , except a browser."

2021-05-15 08:29:44,stocks,"I saw that article. I'm totally on board with it, but it just feels like we are going back to how it was before covid and acting like it never happend. 

I've been teleworking and going into the office maybe 25% office time a month. It's worked fine, I have a work laptop and all. But the sentiment is that we aren't getting enough work done from home. They brougbt us back full time last month. And it's literally been managers walking around super happy and talking to people not actually getting any work done. I really think this is a battle between people who can't be alone and other who can.

Edit: how else can the people who like to talk about Mondays, hump day, and TGIF if they can't talk to people at an office."
2021-05-15 13:59:59,stocks,"After the unemployment checks run around, those 30% employees will quickly realize that few companies will want to maintain WFH for them alone.

2021-05-15 14:03:06,stocks,Interesting to know the perspective of a manager.
2021-05-15 10:13:29,stocks,"The one factor might worth debating is the ecosystem.  For example, iOS and Android dominate because they have a ecosystem of apps that no other companies can compete against and be new market entrants.

I learned that for Microsoft Teams, they don’t allow it to be embedded inside other apps. Other apps in fact need to be built as an app that runs inside the teams app.

Zoom on the other hand being a niche vendor, allows their app to be embedded in other apps.  No other choice really since they don’t have the clout and dominance of Microsoft.

Any other video conferencing vendor that does not build out an ecosystem will slowly wane out. No one will want a stand-alone video app that only does video conferencing.  But I do believe that this could be a two horse race between Microsoft and Zoom."
2021-05-15 08:39:32,stocks,"The (Fortune 50) company I work for would be to differ. Overall productivity went up in the last 12 months. Some people are itching to get back into the office, but building leases and properties have already been terminated/sold. They are downsizing their office space in anticipation of more remote work. It was common for people to work from home 1 day a week. The expected norm moving forward is the reverse, but there will also be those that are able to work fully remote. This is just one example, and it is completely anecdotal."
2021-05-15 10:33:45,stocks,There are plenty of companies that have that PS ratio. It just depends if zoom can keep its growth up or not. 30 seems excessively low but the downside at the current price seems pretty significant.
2021-05-15 14:39:25,stocks,"I think you’re right. All cloud definitely helped.  I remember some customers running versions of Skype or Lync or whatever they called it.  Some companies were an entire major version behind because corporat IT couldn’t upgrade it. Caused for a pretty bad end user experience. 

You’re confirming that Teams has a good ecosystem, which is what makes it great and beyond just videoconferencing software. 

That said, some IT buyers purposely do not buy everything from the same vendor. A bit of an irony. Buying many different apps from the same vendor gets buyers packaged discounts. But if too many of their apps are from the same vendor and that vendor knows they can’t possibly migrate off without disrupting the lifeline of their business, the customer also lose negotiating leverage when it comes to renewal time. So despite the integrated experience that comes from an single vendor, my experience is that some CIO’s prefer a diverse stack. 

So I still think it will be a 2 horse race and maybe a couple more."
2021-05-15 08:48:26,stocks,"I hadn’t thought of it from that angle, I’m self employed and just assumed it was typical bureaucratic BS. I mean, if half of the US can work from home with the same productivity then a lot of mid level managers have to figure out how to justify the existence of their jobs."
2021-05-15 14:47:28,stocks,"It varies by the organization I imagine. My team found work from home worked out great without any noticable drop in productivity. We're moving to a hybrid model in another month and a half once everyone has had a chance to get the vaccine and wait a few weeks for it to take effect. Basically we work in the office half the time and at home half the time on days we choose, except for Mondays when they want the whole team in."

If a company refuses to allow for it, it’s going to decrease morale, and they’re going to lose people. It’s not hard at all to find multiple remote-based positions for a myriad of roles, and chances are the companies that offer them will be better places to work."

2021-05-15 12:07:51,stocks,"PS of 2.25 is pretty low for a company with 65% gross margins. I suspect their margins to improve.

2021-05-15 11:23:32,stocks,"No growth companies are priced that low.  Zm has been growing revenue more than 300%.  The company would be bought out long before it hits 30$. 

Dont own zm but may buy if it hits the hundreds.  They have zoom phone.  Opportunity for international expansion.  They should go after telehealth.

Im interested in their net retention rates post covid.  Why would a business switch?  Businesses are going to continue using video comm.  Zm benefits by being more accessible and not locking ppl into a walled garden like big tech."
2021-05-15 14:56:39,stocks,"I kinda agree on one level, but overall the new cloud model is so atractive to customers that they happily trade all this for

\- extremely great integration. it all works seamlessly, thus reducing overhad costs of managing your IT.

\- better user experience -> more efficiency -> better profits

\- flexible licensing . thats the real kicker. it really is the proverbial ""pay as you grow"" model. and can also be scaled down if ever needed.

licenses can be switched and traded in the same company. soneone quits and we hire a new person ? sweet. log in, create new adress, transfer licenses. done. takes 5 minutes tops. you can even automate that.

from my personal experience, the days of CIO´s preferring a diversified stack and all that are long gone. new they want an efficient ecosystem with as few moving parts as possible and if possible- even less overhead and hassle. reduce costs for personnel etc.

why do you think cloud soluttions, cliud infrastructure, etc etc are all growing at the rapid pace ? its because finally companies have realized that the more they can concentrate on their core business, the better they are off.

I am sooo bullish on anything cloud. but it has to be integrated, and offer REAL CUSTOMER benefits. not some technical mumbo jumbo thats happening behind the scenes. nobody cares about that anymore.   
think about it this way: 

only a few years ago one major argument for luxury car brands (think Mercedes) was ""our service is top notch in case something´s wrong""

modern customers: ""I pay a boatload for a car that works. not for a car that gets repaired fast.""

and the exact same is happening in IT."

2021-05-15 15:07:29,stocks,"Well yea. Our productivity didn't suffer at all working from home. A study was done during the year also to prove that. But management seemed to just not care. Federal government btw. 

When we had the meeting to come back to work full time, the management used the excuse that how can we justify our department if we aren't at work. I just shook my head. They literally thought it was just everyone on vacation even though we were completing all the same work at home."
2021-05-15 12:02:33,stocks,"As well as delineation between work life and home life. WFH has a ton of benefits, but it also mixes that boundary and leads to even *more* expectation that someone is always available to respond to work-related issues (and this was already an issue even pre-Covid). I think the fact that so much of the work force can never really turn ""off"" anymore is contributing to the depression and substance abuse."
2021-05-15 11:41:04,stocks,It has no moat... the question is why wouldn’t they switch to me... Google and Microsoft have more comprehensive platforms with a moat and zoom like features included in them that they are continuously improving. I think there is about a 0% chance they continue to grow 300p this next year. I think 100-150 is probably a fair price for this stock since it is speculative and may prove everyone wrong. 300 a share is way over valued still.
2021-05-15 15:11:27,stocks,"I agree with many of your points but not the days of the CIO and the diversified stack being over. I’m not talking about choosing best of breed. 

1) having apps all working together seamlessly is what the business wants. If it is all too seamless, CIO lose their budget on the army of integrators and IT teams.  If every single service is outsourced, who is going to report into the CIO?  CIO all want bigger budgets and power. 

2) negotiating time. Business users love SaaS. But every year, it is the same deal. Customer will say they don’t really use this and that despite the data showing users are logging in consistently. That’s what they say in order to get a better deal. And also threaten to leave. Do vendors really give a customer the best discount if they know the customer aren’t likely to go elsewhere?  What chips will a customer have to play poker with if they don’t have more than one vendor to play against each other?

Both of my points are not about the tech but more around politics. Politics will not go away even with the best tech"

2021-05-15 16:38:22,stocks,"I am not disagreeing as you bring up very good points. 

especially with more and more CIO´s coming up being more business oriented than Tech oriented. 

my ""generation"" wanted to have to worry about as little stuff as possible, so they coulc concentrate on stuff they were interested about. most were coming from Tech itself, thus they loved their datacenter, their network. their ERP systems.. or their server virtualisation platform. 

more ""modern"" CIO and tech managers are much more managing orentied. do know  a LOT Less about the actual workings of stuff. but do care a lot about what is mentioned on their business card. 

I agree. it all boils down to politics. 

but : if you are one of the bigger corporations (say .. several thousand people needing MS365 licenses, you only pay a fraction of normal prices anyways. hard to squeeze any more discounts out of that. 

also, most services cannot be switched and replaced during one term. usually - even if theere is no real vendor lock - you are somewhat commited. unless you throw loads of cash and time and effort into making the switch. 

some stuff goes very smooth. but try leaving SAP or even switching a legacy SAP ERP with all kinds of customaziotions, data interfaces, addons etc etc.. even the ""upgrade"" to HANA is an enourmous endeavor. 

and back to MSFT and their business products: there simply is no alternative with a meaningful market share. and there is nothin on the horizon threatening that status that I know of. 

&#x200B;

anyways. this takes a turn towards stuff that had nothing to do with ZM being able to grow or not. which I doubt , unless they are able to ... na. they will end up being a niche product. big spike because of covid and some clever marketing / timing. but why pay extra if something comparable is already priced into what customers are already paying for and is better integrated into their daily working tools.."

teleworking is a dream come true, i already got my family and my friends; i work to get paid.

i struggle to understand the fiscal benefits of working from the office. remote work; enables recorded interaction, which for me in IT is immensely useful for referencing.
also i’m not sure how many offices are on lease over companies owning them but i’d assume it was more leases. then there is all the utilities, people and facilities required to keep a building of people running… WFH is just more economical"

2021-05-15 14:09:14,stocks,"Its just my opinion obviously I shouldn't speak so decisively. I think DCF valuations for netflix are taking into consideration growth I believe they will not likely achieve. This is partly why the stock dropped so much after a decent earnings report. With the competition increasing, margins will decrease, and so will user growth."
2021-05-15 14:17:23,stocks,"Depends where you are looking at growth? Is it just subscriber growth? Do you think they could increase their ARPU? What happens if they take over sports? Audio? Create a YouTube platform? We don’t know if Netflix is going to be streaming forever and always. I think they are good.

They can gain more subscribers and keep ploughing cash in content and there will get to a state where no other streaming service offers as much good content and can then start to hold that back - whilst the subscriber growth and ARPU increases."

Personally I would pair it with Paypal instead of Visa.

Edit:

Israel always fighting - now if israel went to war with iran - big difference - oil gold defense lets go

Another issue is time duration of events - the pipleline - it’ll be down a week or two but its not like the pipeline is gone or destroyed

Same with the texas storm - lasted a week - it was certainly devastating but most businesses schools etc were back open and running the next week and full capacity the week after

2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Huya: severely undervalued. Huya: The most undervalued company in the market.

https://i.imgur.com/dVC4QND.jpg

What is Huya? 

Huya is the largest game streaming platform in all of China, it’s basically the Chinese equivalent of Twitch. 

Esports is absolutely huge in China, bigger than in the west, it’s like a real sport over there. They hold tourneys in giant $900m stadiums and offer substantial cash prizes to winners. This is an industry with strong tailwinds and we know there will only be massive growth for the foreseeable future.

The majority shareholder of Huya is Tencent, which is great news for Huya because they can buy exclusive streaming rights for all Tencent games like League of Legends and Dota2 as well as exclusive broadcast rights for tournaments, which is creating a very nice moat. Add the network effect and you can forget about anyone ever challenging Huya’s dominance in the industry. We all know Google and Microsoft could never even compete with Twitch despite sniping the largest streamers Ninja and Shroud, because the network effect for game streaming is just that strong.

So what makes Huya so undervalued?

Well, just look at these numbers:

Market Cap: $4b

Sales: $1.67b

P/S: 2.4

PE ratio: 28

PEG ratio: 0.3

2020 Revenue growth: 30%

2020 Earnings growth: 89%

5 yr revenue cagr: 20-30%

Cash: $1.6b

Debt: $0

Compare these with a somewhat similar company, Bilibili, the Youtube of China.

Market cap: $37b

Sales: $1.8b

P/S: 20.5

PE ratio: 0

PEG ratio: 0

2020 revenue growth: 50%

2020 earnings growth: -118%

5 yr revenue cagr: 35-45%

Cash: $2b

Debt: $1.29b

But why?

Huya had been hit with the perfect storm of terrible news. We all know tech and growth stocks are crashing right now because of inflation, add the fact that Chinese stocks are getting hammered right now because of the new regulations that threaten to delist some of the shadier Chinese companies out there. But that’s not all, there is something else holding this stock down, a pending merger with their largest competitor Douyu.

This potential merger would basically double Huya revenue instantly, double the cash on the balance sheet, while giving them a new market cap of roughly $7b, and they would instantly capture 80% of all game streaming market share in China. Basically a monopoly in a hyper growth industry. They could also increase margins substantially with no competition and no need to outbid competitors with large contracts to their streamers to keep them on the platform.

Under normal circumstances this potential merger would be the most bullish development of all time, but not today. The CCP really doesn’t like it. They don’t like Tencent buying up smaller companies within an industry, merging them together, and creating a monopoly. These days it seems like there is an article every day about how the Chinese government is really starting to crack down on Tencent and Alibaba. The Huya Douyu deal is at the center of all of that China stock FUD, and there is a real good chance that this merger gets blocked outright within the next month or two.

This is bad for Huya? 

Not really. Whatever happens, it’s good for Huya share price. Right now Huya is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. There are a large number of shorts looking to take advantage of the price difference between Huya and Douyu shares, Arbitrage shorts. They will have to cover either way once the merger decision is reached, leaving Huya to run higher once the merger FUD is over. Over time, Huya will rise to reflect the strong fundaments and growth of the company. 

This stock should be 5x the price it is today at a bare minimum.

If you have a bear case, please share."

Personally I’ve been eyeing Huya because of their growth numbers and balance sheet, unfortunately the cash I delegate to Chinese shares is already tied up in other battered stocks. But I’ll definitely look to move profits over to huya if my companies move up before huya does."

2021-05-15 07:32:23,stocks,"In 1993 (28 years ago) the best games were X-wing, Day of the tentacle, Mortal combat 2, the arcade version, Syndicate and Doom. Most likely you never heard of them. This industry experiences dramatic changes in a few years to the point where whole genres of games rise in popularity and then vanish into obscurity, whole methods ofplay emerge and vanish. For instance have you been to a LAN party lately? Well it was all the rage when Doom 2 was popular, we played a lot in some kids basement by physically transporting our conputers there and connecting them with a cable. Nowadays this seems ridicolously arcane, like playing chess through a telegram.

 In this market betting on that a now popular company with a lucrative business model will exist in twelve years is extremely shaky and probably impossible to say what a now prospering business will earn in 27 years is impossible. 

Remember Interplay for instance? They were hot as hell in the late nineties, yet stock price fell to 1% of what it was worth when Fallout, Baldurs Gate and Planescape Torment were released. It was just 22 years ago, not even 28 and that whole gaming style went out of fashion."
2021-05-14 23:17:40,stocks,"Cannibalizing each others market share and yet growing earnings 89% a year and growing revenues 30%? The merger succeeding or failing is bullish for huya either way imo.

It’s like saying twitch will be worthless because GTA won’t be played anymore. No, people will just watch other games??

Huya has a shit ton of money and has a huge platform to work with, they should be fine"
2021-05-15 08:27:11,stocks,"They are backed by the largest company in China, they have an insane moat where they get exclusive streaming rights to the most popular games in China, and game streaming is here to stay for the long term.

2021-05-15 09:24:27,stocks,"No, I am talking about whole companies and whole technologies. In the nineties LAN parties were the technology to play esports, which were not called like this back then. I highly doubt that streaming will be the technology which will be used even in 2121.

In this industry a PE of 28 is insanely high, simply because the rapid turnover of the underlying technology.

And yes, twitch was founded in 2011. Whole ten years ago. I would not bet my money on it still being in business in 28 years."

Unfortunately a couple of the ones I like are down... about 30%... and have been that way for a couple weeks... cough*AFRM*cough

My idea is to look at it as a time to buy. A flash sale if you will. I like the stocks I chose, so I want them to do well. I should support them by buying right? 

The more realistic/negative side of me is thinking. If it’s been down this long how can I tell if it’s going to stay down for a long time? Or if it will even go back up?

2021-05-14 21:54:45,stocks,"To start, don't look at it as ""supporting"" your picks. This isn't a sport, and there are no teams. Support doesn't mean anything. Taking AFRM as an example, you bought in when they were valued at roughly $21B, right? I would assume you have reason to believe they're worth $25B, or $30B, or whatever value you placed on them. Assuming nothing has changed regarding their financials, performance, whatever, you would still have that target estimate. So anything south of that would be a discount to you, and a decline in share price is irrelevant, because you have reason to believe it's worth $30B.

Determine fair market value for every company you want to invest in, and reevaluate with every quarterly report. Assuming FMV is above current share price, you hold and/or buy more. When it surpasses FMV, you sell."
2021-05-14 21:52:49,stocks,"If the fundamentals of the company have not changed and you still believe in the company, then take advantage of the dip and average down. 1 year is a short time for investment so it’s normal to see large price fluctuations. Buy and hold is my recommendation."

2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Why I Think AMC Will Result In Bagholders Alright, this will be quite unpopular, but I don't buy this AMC will squeeze to the moon thesis for a few reasons.

Let’s look at liquidity:

AMC had $813m in cash as of 3/31/21. Since then they’ve raised $428m in fresh capital through share issuance, bringing up their total to $1.241b. This is good except their current cash burn is \~$300m/qtr which gives them 4 quarters of runway. I do think that as covid goes away completely (possibly by fall) that there’s a chance for this to stabilize. But there are a lot of variables to this such as timeline of opening and attendance rate once we are fully open.

Next there's the valuation:

Forget covid and let’s value them assuming everything returns to normal. Average adj. EBITDA between 2018-2019 was $850.3m. EV today using today’s stock price and 3/31/21 debt numbers is $16.1b, which gives us 18.9x EV/adj. EBITDA multiple. For comparison, the same multiple was 6.9x in 2018. So assuming things return perfectly to normal, AMC is still valued 2.7x what it was in 2018. The highest market cap that AMC had previous to this year was in 2017 when its market cap was $4.0b vs. $5.8b today.

Conclusion:

AMC is massively overvalued (who knew). Of course, everyone will point out this is a short squeeze opportunity like GME. However, there will probably never be another GME which once had 141% short interest at its peak vs. \~20% for AMC now. What that means is GME had a legitimate reason for its stock price to completely decouple from its fundamentals, AMC doesn’t, not to quite the extent of GME. There may be some squeezes here and there, but more players will join the short when they see how overvalued AMC is.

The current buying is predominantly from retail, and the CEO even boasted as much saying retail investors comprise of 80% of the share base. While people think this is a positive, I disagree. There is a reason institutional ownership is low and it means that while the stock price can certainly continue to go up, it will also shoot down just as fast, once everyone begins to exit. With a short interest of 20%, how are 80% of the people going to get out? Who are they going to sell to? In the end, it will just be a shifting of bags amongst the retail.

If I was the CEO of AMC, this would be the best scenario possible. I can continue to dilute the share base and basically salvage my business which was on the verge of bankruptcy. I don’t doubt that AMC will not hesitate to issue new shares within the next year again unless their liquidity situation improves. It’s also why, I think, they would rather do an at-the-market offering rather than a subscribed offering to institutions.

A lot of people are propping this up as something of a fight for the common people against the hedgies, who have done all the wrong. I actually think this can be quite irresponsible it’s driving people to pour into AMC, basically like a Ponzi scheme. Invest safely!"
2021-05-14 21:17:14,stocks,"One point against this, if it’s retail that’s holding now, it’s the same retail that’s probably not looking to sell out any point soon. I don’t know why 80% of holders will want to run for the door if they really believe it’s undervalued and the price was just being pushed down. And if it’s the result of a squeeze, than an eventual price drop is pretty much in the name and anyone who’s still holding for more of a squeeze is just taking excessive risk, and also isn’t likely to be running for the doors if they’re not selling on the growth it’s seen. 

I don’t think the standard metrics really apply to meme stock holders that we’ve seen. I mean there’s always people who’ve taken, and lost on excessive risk, but it seems rather new to see people eat it, for all it’s good and bad. They’re not a crowd who respects institutional metrics or talking head opinions. Fundamentals may matter to some, but they’re needs to be fundamental holders or otherwise the value is really whatever one perceives it to be."
2021-05-14 22:57:17,stocks,But if ur right in a few months and we are all bagholders I'll come back to this post and admit defeat
2021-05-14 21:02:55,stocks,"Hasn't most peoples portfolios been bleeding since march? Tech and growth got slaughtered despite strong earning. Fundamentals are out the window. Look at the nasdaq if you have doubts. With all the media relentlessly attacking these stocks I cant help but notice that these are the only stocks they are bashing. Even stevie wonder can see these stocks being manipulated. Why would that be happening, Do you not think thats strange?"
2021-05-14 20:22:51,stocks,"Right or wrong, I respect your analysis. 

I would like to try and adjust your thinking in one area: lack of institutional ownership in this case is a good thing. Why? Because as institutions get interested, it will only be a positive. And there's LOTS of room for institutions to enter. Just imagine if Fidelity decides to 'take a position'. A purchase of $20 million will move the stock! Then BlackRock increases their holdings, then Goldman, then Putnam, and so on.

JMHO"
2021-05-14 21:12:00,stocks,Institutional ownership isn't as low as of late. Lookup 13F filings that were just released today for Vanguard and Blackrock. Both of them increased their amount of shares like 5 fold!
2021-05-14 21:32:12,stocks,"Funny you make no mention of the insane shorting which is occurring or the cost to borrow which is out of this world. Factor that in with over 85% of the float being owned by over 3.2 million share holders. Then factor in the the amount of shorts surpass the physical limitations with amount of shares available. Margin calls have/are being made and most likely will become public in the near future. If you do some DD beyond ""traditional"" DD even a dumb crayon eating Ape like myself can see that illegal activity is occurring and this whole thing is a powder keg ready to explode. If the AMC's fundamentals were jacking off in an old gym sock at this point it would still squeeze. But yea, fundamentals indicate that there will be bag holders."

Why you care if your not invested in AMC? 

But you convinced all us AMC apes to sell with your wrong numbers, incorrect facts, and your personal opinion on people not going to movies anymore. 

I guess you failed to hear that the last 43 mil shares were sold and AMC has no more to issue. 

On Thursday 2.55 mil shorts shares were covered and we saw a 24% price increase. 

As of Thursday that leaves 85mil shorts left to cover, and that just the shorts that are being reported. 

I have been personally green on AMC since February, up 62% but your shit post just convinced me to sell. 

Thanks shill."

2021-05-14 21:26:14,stocks,"""If I was the CEO of AMC, this would be the best scenario possible. I can continue to dilute the share base and basically salvage my business which was on the verge of bankruptcy. I don’t doubt that AMC will not hesitate to issue new shares within the next year again unless their liquidity situation improves. It’s also why, I think, they would rather do an at-the-market offering rather than a subscribed offering to institutions.""

The counter I would present is that the shareholders \*are\* the customer base and they know this.The report had 3.2 million individual shareholders.

Why would they actively ruin credibility with the core customer base."
2021-05-14 22:18:41,stocks,"I think people are Jonesing for movie. AMC has gain such a massive following and people respect the company more than previous years. That alone will lead to record numbers when everything returns to normal. Fundamentals aside, there is indeed squeeze potential. People are hunkered down.  It also isn't entirely alone in the battle. GME is also eating away at these funds. Eventually there will be a tipping point and margin calls. Causing both to explode. We can wait forever. How long can they?"
2021-05-14 22:52:44,stocks,U miss the point of a squeeze. It has nothing to do with a company's financial condition and everything to do with more people buying than selling. The shorts hold it down by creating sythtic shares to short if the pool dries up and they need to cover due to liquidity or a margin call then the stock will moon.

2021-05-14 21:24:36,stocks,"1) Covid won’t be gone by fall. The number of people refusing the vaccine is staggering. 

2) AMC does do movies at home streaming. It’s another revenue generator. 

3) AMC isn’t GME, but it isn’t a .01 cent stock. They deserve a chance to change, if the board doesn’t shake up, and they just keep taking cash while making no progress while their stock falls and their revenue dries up then fine. But don’t call them dead till they are. 

And last I knew there’s always bag holders in the stock market. 

The whole stock market is a Ponzi scheme. It wasn’t at inception, but it sure is now. The winners are just the ones who know how to make good bets."
2021-05-14 20:02:20,stocks,Buy at 9$. Sell at 14.    Not that I did..but I see it
2021-05-14 20:09:10,stocks,"The stock has actually gone up over 2500% since its low in December 2020. The reason the price hasn't appreciated is because AMC now has 4x more total shares issued than it did in December (100m to 400m shares). 

This means the short squeeze already happened, but AMC was able to issue shares so quickly that they absorbed the squeeze. 

GME didn't issue any shares during their squeeze which is why the price went up so high. But technically, from December to May AMC had a higher gain than GME did during it's peak. It just doesn't show in the graphs because AMC absorbed the incoming money from shareholders by issuing massive amounts of stock every time the price went up.

If AMC had issued 0 shares from December to now, the price of AMC should actually be in the 50's.

TL;DR - AMC shareholders are getting played by the CEO and I would estimate the percent of shareholders who will suffer a loss from AMC to be around 80-90%."

2021-05-14 21:50:19,stocks,"AMC wasn’t going through a squeeze in the way people think. Shorts were in the money (average age was 46 days, shorted at between $13.50 & $15, would’ve need to close about around $16 to put any sort of pressure). What likely happened was that some funds were margin called on the down market and clearing AMC was an easy fix. The volume yesterday and today was more than enough liquidity for any shorts to easily clear and the stock price action never got to the levels needed for an “actual squeeze”."
2021-05-14 22:41:52,stocks,"Fur every $1 AMC goes up I get $23,456. And if I want to play the day trader game with it I can literally make $23,456 several times per day.

Another aspect of AMC's Problems is the rapid rise in consumer prices from 2""x4""'s, cars, food, housing, rent etc, This is sucking up disposable income, leaving EVERYONE with less.

Something your not seeing yet, but will be front page news soon. Is the stopping of land lord's being able to start evictions on none paying renters.There's hundreds of millions of evictions coming very soon. And all those jobs out there going unfilled are shit jobs, working 2 of those jobs will not pay the bills.


This all becomes mute though if the big pop happens, we grab or cash and head out the door. But it's got to happen soon because AMC is burning through it's cash reserves fast."
2021-05-14 22:14:52,stocks,"Oh wow you’re fun at parties aren’t you! First of all.. stop spreading misinformation. Stop trying to talk about something of which you hold less than a base level understanding of. The majority of your points don’t hold water. It doesn’t take a genius level IQ to understand what’s going on. It doesn’t take hours of research. Years of exclusively holding SPY doesn’t make you a market expert.

Secondly.. where on earth are you getting these stats from because some are just flat out incorrect. It’s laughable. Your lack of knowledge & understanding on the subject in general is appallingly obvious.

What even compelled you to write this essay? Letter? Journal entry? And why do you just seem so incredibly bitter about it all? It’s not your money? Why do you care so much? You don’t see anyone in the AMC community going around saying that r/stocks is in essence an online retirement home who’s inhabitants are completely devoted to outdated & old trading methods? As if there’s only one way to make money in the stock market.

And it’s not even about the money for some of these guys either. The whole situation is already giving so many people something they may not have had for a VERY long time.. HOPE. A community. A purpose. FRIENDS even. Get off your high horse. You’re not better than anyone else. Stop being so narrow minded. Open your mind to new ideas and possibilities. Learn a thing or two.

2021-05-14 22:03:09,stocks,"Got to love the lengthy FUD posts where 90% of what they say is complete bollox. 

Evaluating the company's value to say it's market cap is too high is a favourite. Market cap is the total float value. Nothing more nothing less. It's whatever a company's shareholders say it is by their actions and sentiment on the stock. Market cap is also completely irrelevant on a short squeeze play. No one excepts it to just shoot up and stay there. 

The dilution FUD was a good one too. Their current offering is done. They can't issue anymore shares without our approval and they aren't even asking us to anymore. 

They have the most free money on hand they have ever had in their 101 year history relatively speaking which alone will last them until 2023 at which point covid will hopefully be a distant memory. 

They are also currently working on their debt structuring. 

To the mutterings of cinema is dead because streaming. Yeah that must be why Disney and Netflix are bleeding subscribers while Godzilla Vs Kong (a movie that was available for streaming) just crushed it at the cinema. Just because someone doesn't like the cinema doesn't mean their opinion is the majority one. That's just ignorant. 

I love the massively overvalued rubbish too. Based on what? Because you want it to be? Stock is pure sentiment. No one gets to say it can only be this much because fundamentals. If that was the case Tesla wouldn't be over 500 either. Sensible valuations though puts AMCs current stock price at 13 to 16. Given that's where we are just under no one current will be bag holding. 

But.. and more important.. why do you care? 

If you think it's a bad play why are you even taking the time to write this FUD piece? It serves absolutely no purpose other than FUD and you have absolutely nothing to gain from it. Perhaps you're thinking of applying for a job at The Motley Fool and wanted an example article to show them. Who knows. 

However, ultimately you're actually right with your title. Of course an AMC short squeeze will create bag holders when people FOMO into it. Just the same as GME did. 

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion I guess. I just don't get why the need to share it if they have zero investment and nothing to gain. Just makes me wonder what your real motives are 🤔"

2021-05-14 23:20:13,stocks,You scared bro? You scared of new investors profiting on your short selling? This is a squeeze sir please read up on it. There’s no cap on how high a squeeze can go and apes own a majority of the business. Diamond hands absolutely gets you somewhere. Nice try buddy.
2021-05-14 22:37:09,stocks,"Dude this is the worst company analysis I have ever seen. I am so embarrassed for you and can’t believe you’ll actually have some people agree with you.  AMC is not 20% shorted who told you or where did you find that? Lol 
Not going to waste my time. 
I’ll come back after squeeze to show you my gains. ☺️"
2021-05-14 22:56:11,stocks,So for one...please link the info that says short interest is 20% or below. It is literally 12 times that but please show me ur reference and we will go from there. I know as the debater here the proof of burden is on me but the sites that have the correct...as best we know...data require subscriptions from what I know and I also dont know how to create/find/share links on reddit(still a bit of a reddit newbie). Also yes there will be another 500m shares dumped onto the float but the offer is off the table...as it was to be voted on...was voted down...then taken off the table until next year ie after the squeeze...and all of us plan to continue to buy more as we believe if we support the company it will not only survive but thrive and we can make more money post squeeze off of actual stock fluctuation and value after the hedgies are gone. Also they have had record numbers for how many locations they have open and with the capacity requirements there are in place. Within the next month they will be open 100% I'm sure as restaurants are at capacity and as of today the cdc says we dont need to wear masks en masse anymore...driving more ppl to go to the movies. We have already proven movies are here to stay and many ppl not only want to go back out to them but actually miss them and the at least 3.2 m retail shareholders of AMC have been going off the wall renting entire theatres and buying meals at concession and generally supporting the company in every way the company needs them too. They paid off 2 and some change billion of their overall debt this year and also converted I believ another 60pm or so debt for equity with a debt holder...yes there cost of business is 300m a quarter but last quarter...while under capacity restrictions with limited new features and reworking their entire platform...plus opening when the quarter was half over...they made more than 300m so they made cost and then some sobi believe this quarter will be much nicer numbers for bbn us to see. I understand where u are coming from but our community believes inthis...and no to the ppl who are using it as a get rich quick scheme or dumped their life savings into it are not going about it the right way...but most of us our heart is in the right place and i personally have thousands inves th ed but honestly i could lose all that and not care...yes this is about the money a bit and i am hoping to get rich but it's about standing up to market manipulators and hedgies fucking the everyman and no i dont want them to die but i want them to live how we have even if just for awhile whole we are set for the rest of our lives if we play it right. We dont wan td to crash the economy and we dont want to crash the market necessarily but we want things to change and from what we have heard...unofficially...the sec is getting involved...big time. So again u are allowed to have ur opinion and if u do nvm t believe please dont buy in when the getting good as 1 u dont deserve it and 2 u will prolly hurt the rest of us if u paperhand and daytrade the stock. There are a lot of ifs in this movement and nothing is guaranteed but we have a colle five dream and this community is awesome if nothing else. We believe in the dd and info we have and are convinced it's right and I really dont know where ur getting that 20% short interest from because its costing them 250% for their un closed shorts everyday from ortex and I just want to know after this wall of text where ur getting that info from because in my opinion...as I've only read it and do not know for absolute certain as i am not a hedgie work at the office or from ortex and wherever else...but in my opinion u are very wrong. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk

2021-05-14 23:37:34,stocks,"AMC is not a long term play. There is nothing about AMC that signals that it's stock price should be higher now, or in the future, than it was a couple years ago.

GME is making a huge transition to e-commerce and overall being a much larger, more interactive entity in the gaming/entertainment world as a whole.  They have assembled an impressive team to turn the company around in a space that has plenty room for their growth.  GME is a buy whether you believe in a squeeze or not, IMO.  Easy win.

AMC has very little squeeze potential compared to GME as well. If you believe otherwise, you really need to take some time and do some research to try to understand what you are looking at. 

The movement is GME, it always has been. The big brains that are doing AMA's about the short situation are doing it on GME subs, and AMC doesnt get mentioned.  DFV never believed in AMC and most likely still does not have a position in AMC. 

An AMC squeeze is possible, but most hodlers believe it is a distraction away from GME and a way to divide people.  IMO AMC is for people who think they are ""too smart"" to get sucked into GME but think they have stumbled on the new play, and shares are cheaper as well so it's easy to get into.  I do have 30 shares of AMC that I bought from time to time with leftover money in my account, just in case, but it's not even .1% of my portfolio.

I wish the best for everyone and dont want to see AMC believers left holding the bag.  It saddens me, though, to see that so many people have been duped out of the real play here and are so convinced otherwise.  Do your own DD everyone! If you read the DD of others, at least make sure you understand what you are reading and that you verify their information!"

Thanks for your shit DD now crawl under the rock you came from."

I’ve learned my lesson with that shitty stock, it will not get a major run up as they’ve issued so much stock and it gets major resistance at $14. Buying this late in the run up is just stupid."

AMC does not provide that benefit and is overvalued / an absolute distraction due to its float size."

2021-05-15 13:23:25,stocks,Basically every time you have bagholders you have more and more people who refuse to sell “based on fundamentals”. Because a lot of people who bought in late on one pump refuse to accept a loss. Plus the same memestocks keep pumping so people just believe that the same stock will pump again. The reality is for every pump you have lower volume from people who got burnt and moving on and then people who held being more quick to sell the next time. The fact is these meme pumps aren’t going as high each time.
2021-05-14 20:20:21,stocks,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀 so most AMC holders won't get past the title lol

2021-05-14 22:08:19,stocks,"Tech's bleeding is somewhat based on fundamentals. P/e of 40 or higher isn't exactly healthy. Reversion happens all the time in hot sectors.

Main scare was interest rates. Of course that will hurt long duration equity prices no matter how solid earnings were. Think of it like bonds... interest rates and inflationary worries hurt prices when you're paying 40 dollars for a 1 dollar asset so to speak.

People tend to see intention in the wrong places. And of course much of the market is automatically traded by algorithms which just scan headlines and such. It's not some conspiracy.

People got *hooked* on dumb shit thanks to Gamestop (which kind of was a conspiracy I guess). Please take a breath and realize the market isn't always like that."

2021-05-15 09:08:00,stocks,">Fundamentals are out the window.

No. If anything fundamentals matter much more now there is the risk that companies might actually have to pay to keep taking on debt. I have done great YTD and that comes from not buying stocks with a p/e of nil or 1300."

Then, all of that short-squeeze shit happened, and I guess people are still expecting short-squeezes?

Whatever. My reason is really that I'm gambling with money I actually don't mind losing. I think enough people for some reason would rather pay out the ass to go sit in a theater instead of watching movies at home. It's the same reason why people will pay $60 for PPV or something instead of watching the same event for free an hour later."

We didn’t bag hold AMC and never averaged up. Because they were clearly completely different when you looked through the hype fog. There is no ownership leadership to believe in. They are not making a shift in their business model and the short % is not even in the same galaxy. It’s a simple money maker for the shorts. They have no comparison.

2021-05-14 23:34:17,stocks,"It was purchased by a Chinese conglomerate, the Wanda Group, in 2012. They had ZERO experience in running movie theaters. It went public at the end of 2013, with an IPO price of $18. By December 2016 it was up to $35, but in just a year it dropped back down to $14 and has mostly gone downhill since.

Wanda Group promised to spend $500M renovating the theaters, but I don't think that ever really happened. I saw no evidence of it.

I worked for the film festival in Houston and AMC pursued us to sign a 5 year agreement in 2013. Every year our home theater got a little dirtier and more understaffed. We had fewer attendees every year because the theater had become so run down. One year they even had an outbreak of bedbugs! We were desperate to move and we're finally able to in 2019. Then the festival was cancelled in 2020 because of COVID-19. They had it this year but I wouldn't be surprised if it's the last."
2021-05-15 09:56:35,stocks,Except that gme is only at like 20% si. So not much of a moass potential.
2021-05-15 09:54:16,stocks,"Higher float means it's harder to squeeze. Hypothetically, if both stocks were at 90% si, that would leave gme with 5 million shares to buy up before all shares were gone. AMC would have 45 million to buy up before everything was owned. In this example, it's much easier to create a squeeze with gme. But I'm guessing you don't believe the official si report anyway so whatever."

2021-05-14 22:34:50,stocks,Those shares are tabled. Signed and dated. Don’t act like you know. Once again I’m holding enough AMC to buy whatever I want when this is done. And I’m not selling until after the peak. So people holding 1 share can buy your ass.
2021-05-14 22:36:47,stocks,CEO is not authorized to sell anymore shares and would need to be authorized to sell anymore shares. The question was pulled from original proxy and then whole proxy was pulled and meeting is rescheduled for a later time with a new vote.  I believe statement was filled with the SEC that indicates that they will not sell any in 2021.
2021-05-15 14:21:08,stocks,"It’s hard to say what a loss is though. One persons loss is just another’s being in a little too early, and another’s average down though. There’s not really one singular truth other than the current price and the decision to buy or sell from there.

It’s easy to think it’s all bagholders but there’s plenty who are making out on it. They’re holding lofty values despite all odds being against it. Until the values are “reasonable”, I don’t think anyone could really speak as if it’s over or dying out, when they still have days where they routinely move 20%. There could be various reasons they’re not going as high, I mean anything that did extremely well the past year has had a Rocky few months. 

The people feeling burnt and moving on aren’t really the ones I’m speaking about. Those are just the new type of gamblers going on on popular stocks, I’m referring to the people who are actually out to hold them. People who hold through all ups and downs because they’re seeing far and don’t sweat the near, who don’t care about the short term price. The type that won’t feel like they’re bagholders for a long while to come."
2021-05-14 21:47:00,stocks,Water is actually not wet. It only makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the ability of a liquid to adhere to the surface of a solid. So if you say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the surface of the object.
2021-05-14 21:35:37,stocks,"You're wrong in a variety of ways including Disney giving AMC a 45 day privilege of movies before release on streaming. If you think movies are done restaurants might as well be done too, besides restaurants, going to the  movies is the #2 thing people do for entertainment. Not sitting at home in their living room to which they've been confined for over a year. Have fun being alone in your living room?"
2021-05-14 20:16:41,stocks,I don’t think intelligence has anything to do with it. Seeing a good movie in the theater is the shit.

Maybe for people like you who don't like to socialize or have a life, then yeah. But the movies offer an experience that can't be gained sitting at home. AMC is also investing heavily in their streaming service as an additional source of revenue."
2021-05-14 23:11:54,stocks,Have u read anything since the theatres opened...the only streaming service that is making any money is HBO and more ppl are going to see these movies at a theater than renting them...just cause u personally have a wet dream about never leaving ur house again doesnt mean the average person doesnt. Like I said above with half a financial quarter gone before they opened at half or even 25% capacity and they still met there operations costs and made some profit. Ppl want to go to the movies and when they go to 100% capacity ppl didnt realize what they had until the pandemic took bbn it all away...theatres are doing record numbers even compared to before the pandemic...which makes me ask again...are u hiding under a rock or so.ething or just a FUD stomping shill. The o ly point op had was the market cap arguement and as I said earlier fundamentals dont work with meme stocks...market cap...ebita...all that stuff means nothing with GME or AMC the are completely broken away from fundamentals as we know them
2021-05-14 23:50:34,stocks,Ifbu did ur dd on AMC ur thinking would be different...I'm so exhausted arguing on this post now. If u dont want to learn that's one u not us and if we are wrong we are adults and it's our money to lose if we want. Contrary to popular belief 99% are here of our own accord and understand that this is a tricky play and it may not work out. But we believe it will and understand the risks...so for those saying its immoral spreading fomo and taking advantage of poor unsuspecting newbies and whatnot...within a day or 2 everyone who is new ultimately understands what's going on by reading the dd available and has made an informed choice to be here. We are not pumping and dumping...we are not taking advantage of anyone...and we are def not stupid or cultish. The info we have makes sense even in layman's terms and just because u havent seen it or even have just dont believe it...that's on u not any of us and we have nothing to apologize for...yet...I may apologize when I'm a millionaire and I forget to file ur paycheck when u are working for me

2021-05-14 22:14:31,stocks,"Stocks with high retail ownership are usually higher risk vehicles designed for them. BDCs, CEFs.

2021-05-14 23:17:21,stocks,Are you just unaware of the simple DD you can do to find how many institutions have bought into AMC lately...
2021-05-15 00:20:49,stocks,(it was just an example)
2021-05-14 22:10:04,stocks,They did a shelf offering of 43 million shares all of which have been purchased. The CEO confirmed this. Those shares ore not available to short and are owned by investors or institutions going long. Earnings from this totaled half a billion dollars ensuring their viability until the end of 2022 even if they had zero revenue for some ungodly reason. There was a 500 million share proposal which was withdrawn and taken off of the table. A share count is being conducted and will be released on June 2nd and the amount of naked shorting and synthetic shares that are being used to manipulate the stock price that will be exposed will be ungodly. The days are getting shorter for Hedge Funds and they won't be able to manipulate the price much longer. How else do you explain 85% buys vs 15% sells and the stock price barcodes or drops?  AMC is more primed to squeeze than any stock in the market.
2021-05-14 22:09:12,stocks,"some covering yes, a little less than a million if im not mistaken, certainly no more than 1.5 million. AMC is the most heavily shorted stock in the world and the amount of shares available wouldn't allow this. Simple numbers my friend. Do some DD see the manipulation and get on board."
2021-05-15 00:09:28,stocks,Nobits still that high and the shares added were completed over two weeks and gobbled up quick
2021-05-15 00:18:49,stocks,"A metric fuck ton.

Institutional investors do the same thing over the dinner table, collude to see which stocks to pump up next. it’s just retail is dumber and they’re an easy scapegoat. At the end of the day value and worth is subjective."
2021-05-14 22:15:24,stocks,See my response to your top comment. I agree with your thesis. AMC will be nothing compared to other small cap squeezes with very small available float
2021-05-14 23:34:00,stocks,Thank you my point exactly
2021-05-15 00:05:33,stocks,Worth noting that those numbers aren't comparable because the number of shares has increased 4x since Covid started.
2021-05-14 22:14:32,stocks,"Right. I started buying AMC before I heard about a squeeze potential. Just thought it was insanely low priced compared to a smaller theater chain. I’ve lost money in very stock purchase except AMC and been holding and buying since beginning of the year, averaging up. When the entire market is red, AMC stayed green this week. 

AMC is highly undervalued. Those who don’t believe that don’t need to worry. They don’t have to buy into it. But it does make me question why they take it upon themselves to post about it. Like what’s the purpose? Why does it matter to them if they have no hidden motives? 

AMC stock is the safest place to keep my money and nobody can tell me anything different!"
2021-05-14 21:43:12,stocks,"Yea, I get the whole corrupt executives thing, I understand the sheer amount of shares vs other stocks means price dilution, but you can't be corrupt executives if you piss on your customer base and your company fails. I mean you can, but its less lucrative.

You have a base of fanboys that love movies and, at least in my experience, grew up on movie theaters. They are engaged. They have friends (allegedly). All it takes is one person to say ""hey lets go see XXX in theaters"" and you have an event.

All they need to be in activated. Not advice. I'm an idiot. These are my internal musings."
2021-05-15 00:01:14,stocks,Gme isnt going to do anything like AMC will. I'm sry bro but u missed the gme squeeze if u didnt sell at 500...not gonna happen again prolly but AMC is just starting
2021-05-14 21:01:09,stocks,You've never been on r/superstonks I see.
2021-05-14 21:55:05,stocks,"The head of IBKR has [stated](https://youtu.be/_TPYuIRVfew?t=118) that if brokers hadn't shut down trading in January the price would have gone into the thousands. Gabe Plotkin [stated](https://youtu.be/D7N4S_FKMq4?t=17522) that he believed that the highs in January were from retail pressure and a gamma squeeze rather than from shorts covering (he also implied that shorts could have covered before this, but imo he worded himself very carefully during the hearing to avoid stating this for certain).

The thesis amongst the GME folk (myself included) is that the true short interest since January has been obfuscated via a mix of failure to delivers, options strategies (such as using the purchase of far otm puts from market makers allowing those market makers to legally sell synthetic shares on the market, and hence naked short without technically breaking the law) and via shorting ETF's containing GME, and that the true short interest may now be even higher as they've continued to try and suppress the price.

Since January, GME holders have become more angry, understood the situation better (including how the price is set by whatever the collective can hold to) and have subsequently raised their price targets. If we're right, and the short interest is still crazy high, then $1000 is just a small stepping stone on our way to the moon."

However my American countrymen continually surprise me with how inane their lives are and what they think is fun to do and spend money on.

Restaurants are much different- and the equivalency would be what making food at home yourself instead or take out? I cant cook like a pro and most cant and take out food doesn't hold up as well vs. fresh most of the time depending on the type of food."

2021-05-14 21:36:42,stocks,"Agreed. Normally low institutional ownership is a bad sign, but as ownership levels change it can be outstanding. Huge purchases can help with true short squeezes and major price runs.

I would personally be more bought into the naked shorting argument if AMC was still on the NYSE Threshold Securities list. It doesn't appear there have been many failures-to-deliver in AMC recently, that's why I'm skeptical of the naked manipulation argument.

Thank you for the offering information though. I'll definitely keep an eye on AMC going forward. Check out UWMC, been on the threshold securities list for 12 days straight now and Ortex is showing an outrageous 300%+ average borrow fee, even higher than AMC's at it's peak. CEO just announced a fat 300mil dollar buyback as well and the float is already very tight. Dividend upcoming as well. Cheers."

2021-05-14 23:43:50,stocks,"Some shares have been returned the past few days. Those becoming available again makes the borrow fee go down. 

As far as short numbers, short volume has been typically between 35% and 65% of AMC's daily volume, despite having 100% utilization and being hard to borrow. It is hard for me to imagine that there aren't many naked shorts and synthetic shares floating around, similar to GME."
2021-05-15 00:37:14,stocks,"That's hard to know. Based on the price action we have seen in the past (and hopefully some diamond encrusted hands), I think it is reasonable to expect triple digits based on the documented amount of short shares alone."

Lmfao if you really think hedgefunds weren't hedged for the increase in price this week for a couple of dollars, you really have no idea what is going on.

What happened to GME in January was that the price of GME reached highest call option, which would be the AMC $29c for this week. GME ran up to the highest weekly call option on two back to back weeks, which led to the gamma squeeze.

First the price started at $40 one week and the highest call option for that week was the $60c and gme ended at $75 that week. Next Monday GME opened at around $120ish, he highest call option was $200 for that week and GME ended at $225ish. Next Monday GME opened at around $300, the highest call option for that week was the $800c and it was well on it's way to hitting it before it got murdered by Vlad the Stock Impaler 🤬

Going up a couple of dollars is not gonna cause a gamma squeeze you complete buffoon 😂"

I don't believe fintel or any of these other companies reporting because they are literally beholden to citadel and institutional investors.

How can you say it wasn't valuable at $15? $45? $90? It kept going up. There was lots of sound DD about how much cash they had on hand and how the price didn't match the level of bleakness of their guidance. Retailers, the market and all the variables at play decided the value, fundamentals don't really matter with these situations. The value is what people will pay for it.

I understand why you lol'd, but fundamentals are always only one side of the story and they increasingly don't seem to matter anymore. I would say non-financial variables are almost *more* important in today's market. Optics, hype, etc. go a long way. 

It's valuable because people like it and because people believe it has a future. There are tons of examples of this. Good luck telling TSLA holders to dump all their shares just because the market cap doesn't match the fundamentals."

The shorts have been recycled since the first move up to $20, they’re only adding to their short positions and hiding the short interest through puts and synthetic shares. The margin calls are coming, whether you believe it or not."

I understand it should be apes help apes but I havent met a single gme ape who was a wsb knockoff loser who has horse blinders for anything but GME. It's a dead cat bro get over it

2021-05-14 22:46:55,stocks,dude let go of the dinner thing it has to relevance here also I worded shit pretty clearly as my opinion and I have no puts or calls or shares so I don't feel confident enough to bet on it- these are thoughts - its ok to disagree however to bring in some things that are not at play is pointless. And saying Disney is a juggernaut does not refute the fact that they only had a 11.5% market share of the movie industry...
2021-05-14 23:32:48,stocks,"I said I could be wrong from the start- 

please look at every title in the theater right now and in years past think if you could in good faith defend them as being smart or illuminating. 

Most movies are dumb- to really believe otherwise is proving my point."
2021-05-14 21:40:37,stocks,Hard to know where the line is however if you like a lot of dumb shit you may be dumb.
2021-05-14 23:14:09,stocks,Also what does intelligence Hve to do with enjoying a movie at a theatre...u never answered that question just made another snarky nonsensical comment

2021-05-15 01:19:17,stocks,"There are shares available to borrow... Jumped into the hundreds of thousands a couple days ago on IBKR when the price popped. That's only one source, but that could imply that there are even more available on other brokers. If you want to say the shares that got released to borrow got re-borrowed, well yes that might be true but you would expect that on a sharp price increase. Some shorts cover, some people open new short positions.

Check out UWMC. 300% short fees on Ortex (higher than AMC has ever been), and IBKR lists 100 shares available to borrow.

Not saying AMC isn't heavily shorted, obviously it is, but ""most shorted in the world"" might be going a bit far. It also has quite a large float compared to some others which has been recently diluted..."

2021-05-14 21:19:53,stocks,"Ahahahaha i have been investing since March 2020, only 25 years old, and have very very quickly learned to not talk about my investments to other people. If it goes well, they always want more information without putting in any of the work and if it goes poorly, they end up very mad at you.

Now i just make shit posts on reddit 🤷 I'm just very happy I'm not one of those people who legit think AMC will explode. 

Currently more in the GME play myself, but I'm holding a couple hundred shares with a cost base average of $50ish so I'm not too concerned and have way more leeway. Currently up around 200% so i really can't complain. After all, investing is all about making profit... Doesn't really matter how one does it 😎"
2021-05-14 21:56:47,stocks,"I mean I've been fully in GME since early January. I just honestly do not get the AMC play what so ever. I'm extremely confident that the GME play will work out, have spent plenty of time looking into it and i don't give a shit about the noise.

At the end of the day, everybody here is an individual investor and can do whatever their little heart desires. You think AMC is the play, fucking stop getting so defensive when confronted about it."
2021-05-14 22:58:25,stocks,SORRRY I'm from the future and AMC has gone TO THE MOON
2021-05-15 01:37:15,stocks,"The AMCstock sub has a floor of 100k. I think that part of the point of the insane price targets is to inspire people to hold as long as possible. I'd love to see 100k, and I'll hold until it starts to lose steam, but I would be ecstatic for $1500"
2021-05-15 00:41:32,stocks,"I literally don't give a shit about you, and i will laugh my fucking ass off when none of you fucks sell your AMC shares when it spikes to max $100 (and that's being way too generous in my opinion) because you seriously think that stock has a chance to reach a couple thousand or whatever dumb illogical price target you guys have come up with now a days. 

All that subreddits hype about ending above $12.50 doesn't mean jack shit and won't magically cause the price of that stock to keep climbing upwards next week. You're in for a rude awakening Monday morning when literally nothing happens 🤣"

2021-05-14 22:37:10,stocks,"That’s a great explanation of why it was valuable on its way up to the current price. I totally agree.

I also think the lack of fundamental value is going to be the reason this price doesn’t last. Retail excitement won’t last forever. Then it all falls on this hypothetical digital transformation which is still 100% speculation and will almost certainly be underwhelming compared to the current Reddit hype."

2021-05-14 22:50:19,stocks,By what metric do you get 11.5%? total movies? Or popularity? Because if you have Avengers showing vs. a hundred other movies no one has heard if then your point is pointless

At the very least, people will stream it, if they live it go see it on the big screen.  But how many times have you gone to the movies and left unhappy because the movie was not what the trailers sold you?


My point is times change and the ability of pre screening a film before paying $20 for popcorn at a theatre is going to be used."

2021-05-14 23:15:28,stocks,I would have to agree as I have dug a bit further and looked at previous years they have held much larger percentages- So it will be more of an impact than I thought.

2021-05-14 21:44:34,stocks,"Listen, we're not saying the laws are just and that retail investors will have an easy win. But if things were to play out the way they are supposed to, then the hedgefunds are fucked. We know the world is corrupt and they will try every play in the book to not cover their positions, but guess what, as long as that is a possibility, I am not selling a single share. I also believe in gamestop in the long term. So either way, im happy with buying more shares when I can."
2021-05-15 08:21:32,stocks,"Thats ACTUALLY funny. Can you explain even remotely how it's ""the wrong stock""? pretty sure I'm up over double on my initial investment in a fairly short amount of time. How is that with wrong stock by any metric? Not only am I up but AMC is primed to squeeze while the traditional ""boomer"" investors play it safe and sound with AAPL and AMZN. Traditional fundamentals aren't applicable here and guess what, it's working."
2021-05-15 00:13:35,stocks,"Hey, I appreciate your candor. And I hope I bump into you at the movies! Be one of us, worst comes to worst we go back to pre-pandemic levels and you double your investment. Best case scenario, we squeeze and you are rich."

NET might be looking overpriced at 40x but it has a bright future as technology. Once 5G rolls over, IoTs get smarter, and technology advances, it will have massive growth in coming years. Not just technology, I like their strategy as well, not a surprise to see 40x.

My only problem with NET is the valuation.

As an engineering focused company, they're still driven by ""if you build it, they will come"" mentality.  e.g. I start using their services and I don't get email drip campaigns, and they have (to my knowledge) very limited enterprise sales force.

This says good things about their ability to acquire customers cheaply, but they are at a stage where they could add fuel to the fire with a sales pipeline."

2021-05-14 23:41:34,stocks,"> they have (to my knowledge) very limited enterprise sales force.

Is it? Sales and marketing is still consuming 46% of their revenue, which is the largest piece of the pie by far.

It could be they are spending disproportionately on marketing, and don't have a big sales force but it doesn't seem that way."

2021-05-15 11:00:24,stocks,In what way are they better? Comparing cloudflare and fastly is a lot like comparing home depot to Walmart. they're not even competing in the same customer space and this is stated by Matthew Prince himself.
2021-05-15 00:17:16,stocks,"They spend on top of funnel, e.g. sponsoring events and podcasts, but not too much to close and build long term relationships.

Slide 18 there shows they aim to add sales reps after a given market is established, so they're probably in line with what I'm saying. The opportunity is there, but their process is to build up critical mass first. That said, I think they could still be more aggressive with self-service upselling too."

2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Financial Institution Price Targets I understand that price targets are essentially advertisements for individual stocks that some financial institutions may be holding and are mostly worthless well-wishing, but as an example, if an institution releases a hypothetical price target of $130 for a stock that is currently priced at $70, does this mean that the institution is averaging down on their shares? Or are they hoping to just attract more interest to buoy the shares they currently hold? 

What I take from price targets is simply bullish sentiment (when it's marked as a ""buy"" or the price target is above the current share price), but is that all that I should be taking away from it?

Thank you for any help and expertise you can provide!"

Is there still room to run in these trades and are they sustainable at the levels there at?

Just as a lot of the high flying no earnings tech names crashed to reality, are there similar reopening trades?

I heard that a good deal of the value cyclicals have no earnings or low earnings behind them also.

I mean everyone has poured there money into JPM BRK.B etc, and for years financials have underperformed the market.

What about Cruise Lines, casinos, and the materials sector?

What if cruises don't do that well this summer ? Or casinos?

Are these more or less short term trades?

I mean even value has historically underperformed the market.

Is value going to suddenly outperform for years now or just in the short term?"

I don't think you can go wrong with 30 to 40% portfolio in the FANMAGs.

2021-05-14 20:01:07,stocks,"CCL also sold 18 of its ships, aging demographics, has done multiple stock offerings, loads of debt, brought in almost no revenue last year. It took them 11 years to hit pre-2008 highs. Also with gas going up and younger generations not being interested in cruises, I see little growth for CCL. I wish you the best but I have put leaps on CCL."

In my entire life never knew anyone who set a foot on cruise, my assumption is that young generations have way less money to waste.

Many studies shown that next generations are way more conscious on human rights and saving the planet.

Unless they change something drastically and after covid i cant imagine they will be doing well at all"
2021-05-14 20:16:54,stocks,Independent studies have proven 51% of cruise line passengers are over the age of 49. Fun fact 20% of them are white women with a college education. Point is younger people aren't stoked on cruises. As oil/gas prices climb so will the expense of cruises as well. They were already in massive debt pre-covid and then almost an entire year of no revenue that they had to sell ships and do multiple stock offerings. Not my cup of tea. I am sure they will survive for awhile but again I am bearish.
2021-05-15 06:27:30,stocks,"They said the same thing about Oil stocks, the majority of companies recovered after the price of crude dipped below 0 last year. Cruises are in business because they’re profitable otherwise they would’ve shut it down if they didn’t think they could bounce back. The demand is there people from around the world enjoy these vacation trips. If they can’t sail this year they’ll sail soon enough and if the stock price is at $25 with no revenue imagine once they start being profitable again."

Oil has way too much different use.

I do think cruise and airlines are money sink, just because business is not profitable or good, doesn't mean it won't string along for a long time, people work there, get paid etc.

Its the investor money on which they are living on, and personally I don't get it, if i get a feeling company will be living of offerings, investor money, i stay far away"
2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,"I don't understand $TSLA I first began investing in TSLA in mid 2018. I bought some puts thinking that this company was outrageously overpriced; net loss every quarter in 2017, enormous overhead costs that keep growing, ridiculous and practically non-sensible P/E ratio and a CEO whom even back then I'm surprised has not been arrested already. Every fundamental about this company point to it being grossly overvalued yet the stock price just won't go down; it just kept skyrocketing. Eventually around early 2020, I caved in and bought some calls. I thought clearly the market saw something behind this company that I'm not seeing and there appears to be a lot of momentum so I figure I'd just join in on the FOMO. I made tens of thousands (maybe not a whole lot but a non insignificant amount) buying calls and it seemed like TSLA was going to the moon. To this day, I still don't understand why. The best explanation I've found is that people are investing the man himself, despite the Tesla the company being nothing unique even back in 2017-2018 and even less so now. 

  

Fast forward to early 2021. I still had 200 calls at $790 and TLSA suddenly began to crash. This company which showed unrelenting momentum suddenly started plummeting, costing me all my gains from before and then some. From what I read, it seems to be due to increased competition, slowdown of sales particularly in China and \[potentially\] manipulating earnings via BTC trades. Essentially, what I'm interpreting from the TSLA's current bear market is that the fundamentals have caught up, but it still begs the question: why now? Fully electric vehicles are not and have not been unique to Tesla; relying on sales from China is sketchy and incredibly risky especially with US-China relations at an all-time low even before COVID; and the company has had sketchy earnings quarters before but every time, the stock just seemed to bounce back and then some quickly after. The fundamentals that point to Tesla being a shit company were in from of us the whole time and just now the market decides to focus on that instead riding the FOMO? And what was the FOMO even about anyway? Musk may own other companies but do people actually think he's going to invest earnings from those companies into Tesla? At the end of the day, Tesla's business is selling cars and they've been struggling to fill orders.  

  

  

TL;DR what's the deal with TSLA? How can this stock that just kept going up suddenly lose so much momentum despite the underlying fundamentals being largely the same?  

  

  

Secondly, what's the view of TSLA now? I've spent a portion of my remaining funds on 100 puts at $510. If you think that's a wrong move, then I'll back now and just forget about investing altogether since clearly I don't know enough and am not qualified to be investing in the first place."
2021-05-14 23:28:07,stocks,"If you want to read the most Bullish case possible for TSLA, read Cathie Wood’s and ARK Invest’s recent price target valuation paper(available on their website) pricing TSLA at $3000 by 2025.  This is full of future predictions: costs dropping precipitously, manufacturing accelerating, battery technology advancing, self driving, AI, robotaxis, etc.  If you want to read Bearish case, read the subreds and analyst reports critiquing this report ruthlessly.  Very different evaluations and lots of conviction on both sides.  Seems like Bears rely more on the idea that the rate of change in the past can serve as reasonable predictor of future change; whereas Bulls are more likely to embrace idea that we are on path of exponential growth and explosive change."

Its not fully rational, either you believe in the Tesla vision or not."
2021-05-14 21:08:14,stocks,"Though Tesla is insanely overvalued, they most assuredly worth more than other car companies. That should be obvious. Consider margins once they stop capital spending. Tesla will have at least double the margins of old companies by virtue of not needing dealers alone.

Further, Tesla is probably going to dominate the solar landscape as well as the charging landscape and they will be able to leverage solar on their chargers. It is by far, the most vertical company of all the car makers.

I never once cared for beemers. They look old and tired. Mercedes hasnt made a reliable car since the 90s. Porsche never interested me even when I was a teen though I wouldnt mind owning a classic 911 just for historic reasons. VW is a bunch of criminal fraudsters and their cars are unreliable and expensive to fix for no reason. But again, all this is personal experience and my opinion... see what I mean? 

Tesla is fine. They are the premiere car brand now and going forward. Thats what happens when you are the market leader which will also translate to being able to sell at a premium and thus even higher margins.

That said, I am bearish on Tesla. Stock is over valued and a lot of wasted time and effort has been put into self driving that most people dont want and probably wont happen for tech reasons or will be a major legal liability. I dont see robo taxis or semi's ever being human free without designated roads."
2021-05-15 11:57:10,stocks,">Tesla as a car company is nothing super special. Yes, they are currently leaders in EV but for how long? Every major brand is catching up. Also Tesla for me lacks a certain character.

There are 2  logical errors in this reasoning: 

(1)  You're assuming that Tesla's rate of innovation is slow enough that other companies can innovate faster and eventually catch up.  Tesla's pace of innovation is not slowing.  Tesla's willingness to try new manufacturing techniques (such as large castings that nobody else uses) and re-work existing architectures (like electrical systems) is unmatched.  

(2)  Tesla's business is predominantly EV today, but that may not be the case in the future.  Energy storage, energy generation, and grid balancing (Autobidder software) constitutes a small % of Tesla's revenue in 2021, but that could grow substantially if distributed Tesla systems gradually replace peaker plants on electricity grids worldwide.   Also, the Machine Learning training platform (Dojo), could have applications far beyond training the Neural Nets used in self driving cars.  Being able to train a wide variety of robots for different tasks, would open up an enormous source of high margin revenue. 

Amazon started out selling books online.  Nearly 30 years later, Amazon is far more than a bookseller.  It is a mistake to assume that Tesla will stay predominantly an automotive company."

NIO is valued entirely on Hype. The idea that a start up EV company in China is going to be able to waltz into Europe and the US and be a dominant player in the EV market against established legacy auto manufacturers is laughable and 100% speculation/a-gamble.  

The amount of people hyping this company is insane and its funny because I would guess probably 90%+ of them have never seen a NIO car in real life and just regurgitate what they read on other stock boards and seem to think that it makes sense for a start up car company to have currently the 10th (was previously the 6th largest) largest market cap in the auto manufacturing industry. The cult behind EV stocks like Tesla and NIO is insane."

2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 14, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 14, 2021**

Stocks continued yesterday’s momentum, with the S&P 500 (SPY) closing 1.51% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.21% up, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.11% up. The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable, with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday. In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Fed’s commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said all week that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend or is just bouncing.  

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Yesterday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents.

In what seems like an emerging market with tons of potential, a homegrown ""super-app"" with a proven track record seems like a no-brainer. With news that Grab is going public via AGC, I figured the ticker would have exploded by now. But it hasn't.

What am I missing? Even if Grab's performance is only ok in the near term, isn't a price jump nearly guaranteed after the merge is complete? What does anyone have to lose here? Surely the news has gotten around by now; I just read a WSJ article about it."

Just because you tell someone to do something doesn’t mean they have to do it. And if they do, they weren’t coerced against their will. They have the option to not listen to people.

If someone says:”buy amc”

And 1 person does... it’s not manipulation but if 100k people do, it is.

Whose fault is that a certain number of people or not follow the opinions of others.

Why should i be afraid of being sued if I were to tell someone that I think they should buy something. Whats the point of freedom of speech in that case then.

2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Amazon To Hire 75K Fulfillment Workers With Starting Hourly Pay Of $17, Bonuses Up To $1K 'Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) will employ 75,000 logistics and fulfillment workers in North America at an average starting wage of $17 an hour.

Most of the hires will be placed at the company fulfillment locations and network of local delivery centers after positioning its final-mile delivery network at the closest range of the end customers.

Amazon has 409 delivery stations in the U.S., out of which 344 support package deliveries and the rest support heavy, bulky items that are typically non-conveyable.

Amazon plans to build 229 additional delivery stations, out of which 193 are meant for packages. Amazon has 16 delivery stations in Canada, with seven more on the drawing board.

Amazon will offer several new employees a $1,000 signing bonus and an additional $100 to the vaccinated ones. Amazon offers on-site vaccinations at over 250 locations in the U.S. and Canada.

In April, Amazon announced an investment of over $1 billion for a wage hike of over 500,000 hourly employees by between 50 cents and $3 an hour.

Last year Amazon added over 500,000 workers globally, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The hiring comes just before the annual Prime Day shopping event, which was preponed from July to June.

Amazon continues to face employee flak for difficult work conditions in their warehouses including Alabama, and Chicago. The company has refuted the allegations and assured necessary efforts for improved working conditions.'

2021-05-15 02:09:50,stocks,I work in HR. Warehouses and manufacturing are interesting worksite dynamics. I think people work the lower paying customer service type jobs because they like interacting with people. Plus the jobs are usually more flexible. Warehouse and manufacturing is tough and has an interesting group of people to lead. They pay more but certainly demand more.

Half the country is waking up from a slumber of shit sales and layoffs. We are undergoing one of the biggest needs for labor since (I am guessing) a very long time ago.

Get in there before unemployment starts cutting people off then you're *really* screwed.

Put in more effort. If you get denied, politely ask HR if it was the interview that bombed, your work history, you farted, etc. Find out why you got shut down and work on it. 

Probably the easiest time to find a job in the last 20 years. You got this."

Never heard of gloves tracking anyone lol, the device every tracked associate carries does though, not all associate jobs are tracked.

The use of 3p companies is how Amazon is able to say they meet ecological promises and safety %'s. When you see an Amazon van or trailer wreck on the news, that doesn't affect Amazon's safety record. It goes on JB HUNT or Joe Blow Trucking's safety record. All the emissions the vehicles put into atmosphere dont count either except for what the yard trucks produce and the under 1% of freight delivered by Amazon transportation employees . Sneaky but smart.

full disclosure : Amazon transportation employee and shareholder. I've been disciplined for SmartDrive infractions as well. Never for yawning but that is a real infraction, see it on regional monthly reports."

2021-05-15 08:59:43,stocks,"I even thought that $15 an hour was pretty good for most Amazon jobs before. It’s unskilled work that anyone in decent shape can do. That sounds pretty good to me. If they were paying $10 I think it would be a different story. But the fact that I could make $15 an hour over the summer very easily was always a blessing to me. There were not many other jobs that had that sort of flexibility. 

I worked at Whole Food as a shopper so I can’t touch on warehouse conditions, but for my job personally, it was the easiest thing ever for $15 an hour. Obviously the warehouses are probably worse. I know a couple of friends who are fine with it, and one who left because they said they hated it. So the issue really comes down to management and worker conditions, which is a big deal obviously. But I personally just think that there isn’t too much room to complain pay wise."

2021-05-15 08:26:34,stocks,"Yea. I’ve talked to workers, and the diapers thing isn’t a myth. It takes them 5 min to get to the bathroom and back. 

They have 30 min of TOT per day(time off task) if the pass that they get written up and then fired. 

Every second they aren’t scanning is counted against them. So some people wear diapers because they’re afraid to go to the bathroom because it’ll eat up too much of their time. 

They don’t have time to eat their lunches. Their backs and knees hurt. 

Some men do pee in bottles. 

If you’re late to your station they take an hour of unpaid time from you and you don’t get paid the rest of the hour you work. 

Amazon is what the 1930’s and pre unionized labor would have been like."

Because I’ve done all of the above. 

There’s no defense for the indefensible no matter where it happens, and when enough people tell the same story over and over, it’s likely the truth.

2021-05-15 09:02:54,stocks,"TOT is based on the time spent after not scanning something for 5 minutes then is added together at the end of EACH shift and only is counted for that shift. The person with the highest amount for THAT shift has to explain/excuse (I never heard a manager not excuse TOT because of bathroom breaks) the time below 30 minutes or yea you do get written up, which takes 3 to get fired. So either that person is lying or doesn't know what they are talking about. Also its a warehouse job? obviously physical labor can make peoples back and knees hurt. Unpaid time is always for any reason taken in hour intervals so if they have any extra time they can literally put 5 minutes or whatever amount of paid time in from a literal app now and be fine lol I'm not saying they dont have shitty policies and dumb high standards but atleast don't blame shit that I know alot of people have and can manage to keep their job."

If you leave to go to the bathroom the computer monitors your productivity which results in “time-off-task” and “low tak time” which can effect your employment. This is at an Amazon Robotics FC btw. I worked both on the floor and HR. Also 18 month employees make 25 cents more than day one new hires ($15.50) at my building which is a joke.
2021-05-15 02:20:47,stocks,"I don't hate unions. Most their old function has been taken over by government. Union Safety was big and good. OSHA took over. Workplace injuries was a big union issue. Worker's comp took over. Overtime was a big union issue and government took over by mandating 1.5x pay over 40.

My experience so far with unions is they spend 85% of their time defending people who do awful things at work."

if we start paying lazy unskilled folks solid wages, skilled wages will go up in response, as will the cost of living, so the end result would just be inflation vs more buying power for lazy folks.

maybe people should just try literally anything instead of demanding more money for flipping burgers"

2021-05-15 03:33:55,stocks,"A lot of people are shitting on DC - it's not the worst. There are lots of government employees, nurses, analyst/consultant/accountant/tech types, and strong yuppy culture (similar to Palo Alto). For families, lots of focus on getting their kids into good schools and colleges, lots of pressure. For younger professionals, work culture is more East Coast and uptight in general than Silicon Valley or LA.

There isn't that ""fake chill"" vibe I get on LA or SF though. Much fewer of those hustlers with a facade of carefree calm. If someone is scheming, they'll let you know they're scheming. Think Mitch McConnell instead of Adam Neumann. People are either ""I'm struggling to survive,"" ""I'm busting my ass to make it,"" ""I've made it and I'm chilling,"" or ""I've checked out of the rat race and I run a taco truck now.""

Traffic is on par with SF or LA. DMV drivers are generally very competent, but at rush hour it's like everyone took three adderalls before getting in the car and told themselves that if someone passes them today, then they have dishonored their family.

Lots of beautiful forests and flowers, and pollen to match. Hot, humid summers, cold winters. No earthquakes. All in all, it's just another place to live."

We have 3 airports and one 15min from Adam's Morgan  or most close in neighborhoods. 
The city is small and bikable. The traffic is into the city and going to Amazon is a reverse commute from DC.

2021-05-15 09:21:23,stocks,"Well I wouldn’t be so quick to assume that just by the job descriptions, which is why I clarified. Some warehouse positions aren’t much more physically demanding than what I did. They could make the shopper job much worse by increasing the picking rate or by just having terrible managers. On the flip side, warehouse jobs could be better due to better managers and a lower picking rate. 

Obviously I don’t think that’s the case here, but management plays a big role. The point I was really trying to make was that warehouse jobs are probably worse management wise, however I can’t exactly speak on it from personal experience. But for most people it seems like a decent enough temporary job. It’s just not a career since there’s no room for advancement and to some people it kind of sucks."
2021-05-15 11:03:59,stocks,"I worked in the warehouse itself, packing boxes and loading semis. It wasn't that bad. Physically it was a little tiring, but the worst part was how boring it was, and the wage more than made up for it. 4/5 of my friends who worked there disagreed with that assessment though, so take it how you will."

2021-05-15 02:51:00,stocks,"Well it doesn’t sound like you’ve dealt with trade unions at all. People can be fired in the blink of an eye and without cause and sent back to the union hall. I’ve seen it 100x. Very different from teachers union,police, etc. You can also thank Union lobbyists who have pushed prevailing wage laws for your guys high hourly pay, because I guarantee they aren’t making that on a private job. I’m not going to argue against my job which allows me to live comfortably. You can take your whole “mY guYS mAKE teH sAMe aND aRE NoN UNioN” crap and find someone else to have a pissing contest with.

Edit: looking at your post history you work in HR and aren’t even in the trades let alone the field. You probably don’t make shit and are trying to have a pissing contest over money you don’t even make. I think we’re done here. At least you know how to push a pencil though ;)"

I’m more concerned with him paying his share of taxes than him being morally obliged to create a better workspace than his competitors. I certainly would because it would be important to me, but the economy isn’t driven by morals and it never will be as unfortunate as that may be. At the end of the day Amazon is providing thousands of unskilled laborers with jobs and as long as they aren’t being taken advantage of as compared to other similar jobs... there isn’t much to call out here."
2021-05-15 09:38:30,stocks,"For stow which is putting items in the big robotics pod they want you to have an average of 10 seconds to place an item in a pod bin. It seems easy but the pods are rarely empty so good luck if you get 20 totes filled with rice cookers or dog food. Keep in mind you’re doing this for 10 hours and you don’t get music. You’re also assigned a station at the beginning of the shift to limit interaction with work friends.

It’s not fun work but most locations do have full time hours with good benefits for non-contract warehouse workers which can be life changing for associates who may have limited career opportunities. Amazon will also allow you to just get up and leave if you have enough time to cover your absence for the rest of the shift."

2021-05-15 03:50:12,stocks,"Stay west. I lived in DC metro for 13 years and everything everyone is saying here is 100 percent accurate including the down voted comment about the politicians, lobbyists and racism which works any number of ways and in spite of the multi culturalism most people stick to their own cultural/racial cliques. The best part of living there is all the historical and cultural stuff but with the awful logistics it is a challenge."
2021-05-15 09:10:51,stocks,"DC has a very unique culture. It's ""blue"" but the people are actually very conservative in their way of thinking.   
For instance, companies in DC still have yet to adopt the idea that their employees shouldn't have to wear a suit and tie every day. There are a lot of people from close by east coast colleges, or that grew up in the area since people don't often leave, which creates somewhat of a monoculture in certain groups. All the people I left behind there tend to see the ""get married have children"" path as the only real acceptable life path. This is in contrast to the west coast ""liberalism""where it's more of a do what you want, wear what you want culture. If you don't conform in DC it will be very obvious.   
The lobbysts, consultants, lawyers, and want to be politicians dominate the residents, and they are generally not great people. Mostly there's a lot of image, power, and money obsessed people. What the other poster said about people sticking to their own cultural cliques is also true.   
I find that west coast people enjoy the outdoors more, you'll be hard pressed to find anyone in DC that enjoys anything outdoors besides sports. You're also not near any areas of natural beauty, like SF and hawaii have. The primary form of entertainment is crappy generic biergardens and bars.   
 It's hot and crazy humid in the summer, and biting cold (because of the humidity) in the winter. As everyone mentioned the traffic is horrible, and it's not a very well designed city. If you're not living on a metro line and going somewhere else that's on a metro line you'll have to drive, it's a spread out city so walking isn't great.   
Positives:  
There are a lot of NGOs headquartered there, and those people tend to be super cool. The diversity is amazing, if you can make friends outside of your culture/race it's such an awarding experience. The ethnic food is really really good. The cultural opportunities with the museums etc. are really great. The people tend to really value their friendships much more than you would find in SF or Seattle. Once you're friends with somebody, they'll put you first, instead of what activities they are doing.   


Generally, I think for somebody from the west coast who's mostly been living in culturally liberal places like SF and Seattle (not ""democratic"" just culturally liberal) you'll find that DC is a big culture shock."

2021-05-15 09:30:10,stocks,"I was clear. It takes 5 min to get to the break room, time to heat food. A lot of people smoke so they have to go outside past security, and then come back through. 

It takes another 5 min to get back to your station and they want you back early, so even those that don’t smoke at best get 10 min or less to eat if they have to use the bathroom. 

Is that clear enough, and yes I get defensive when it comes to people suffering in a place that purposely causes suffering. 

I would be just as hostile to someone saying the London tower wasn’t that bad of a place, just because they torture you and hang you by your wrists for days on end, or the American slavery called prison isn’t that bad because it’s okay to torture someone who committed a crime. 

I’m pretty equal out in all my policies that humans shouldn’t be tortured. It’s one of the reasons I enjoyed anthropology. Studying human history and evolution gives valuable insight to what cruel labor does to the human body. 

And I am aware Amazon pays people to do PR on social networking platforms and try and keep others from knowing how awful and brutal a job it is.

2021-05-15 12:00:37,stocks,"I think it also depends on your age group. I think it's a much better area for someone who is young and just starting in their career. I'm later mid career and it's rough for singles in my age group because as someone mentioned everyone is into the  get married and have kids lifestyle. I'm now married to someone not from there but dating there is brutal. Lots of dishonesty and people looking for affairs outside bad marriages they stay in for money and status. Again, I'm talking about my age group. 

Totally agree about the dress code for most jobs there but I got lucky with my current company which is really chill when we were in the office but because of COVID we are all now working remote and it will likely stay that way, but we are not the norm. 

Agree about the food. I found there were plenty of interesting cultural things to do in the embassies, museums, theater and music venues but I got lucky and got tuned in by people who had lived there a long time. It's a great area for history buffs. 

I think it does have natural beauty, but it is not my favorite landscape. You have to drive out of the DMV metro area to get to the good places, Shenandoah Valley is lovely and the Chesapeake Bay area is great for sailing and it's very historic. It's not a place for people into extreme sports. I prefer the west coast nature and lifestyle myself but I learned to like what was there. 

Agree about the power and money obsessed types and they are the majority. It can be highly competitive and stressful in the workplace too especially in government related jobs. I moved there from Austin, TX  where most of my family lives, and yes it was a culture shock. But at this point I'll never go back to Austin either, it's ruined as far as I'm concerned.

For me, as a very new investor (I’m only a little over a month in, so take my word with a grain of salt), “best” are the stocks that have shown consistent, steady growth and have been minimally affected by losses. At this time, my four “best” stocks are…

4) Costco (COST) - It’s had a few swings in its price, but it’s never dipped into the red. As of this post, it’s gained 6.25% in a little over a month, and it’s already paid a dividend.

3) Goldman Sachs (GS) - I’ve only held this stock for about two-three weeks, but its growth has been spectacular. In researching, I found out it was still undervalued, and man, has it shown. Even when it tumbled, it hasn’t been a nightmarish fall. 6.5% growth already.

2) AbbVie (ABBV) - I knew nothing about this company and spent three days researching it before I bought its stock, and it’s been one of the best purchased ever. It doesn’t grow as fast, but it hardly ever falls, even when the whole market is tanking. Also, its dividend is huge (4.46%). It’s grown 8.35% in almost four weeks.

1) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) - First stock I ever bought. Outstanding, steady growth. Hardly has a down day. 10.8% growth in over a month. The only drawback? No dividends."

Its performance was horrendous because it was still using ancient hardware, it had no modern software aside from the token adobe stuff and some office stuff (wordperfect? or was it corel? dont remember), and it was most certainly NOT media friendly at all by even the wildest imagination. It was a media and network nightmare actually because it still used appletalk (lol) and had almost no modern compatibilities. If it wasnt for Windows ME it would have sold like all the other prior macs."
2021-05-15 10:21:40,stocks,"Thats is inherent to RISC design philosophy. In theory, a RISC processor can do whatever a CISC can at the time >> IF << you code it right. That was the selling point after all. They also did have SMP by then and dual chip macs... they still sucked.

So it had to start with the OS and then the OS needed to enforce things on 3rd parties or at least promote best practices. But Apples own OS was notoriously inefficient and of course IBM didn't go out of their way to provide many libraries either."

FY97 Apple was bleeding money (-$1B.) FY98, they introduced the iMac, which immediately became the fastest selling Mac yet, and turned a profit ($308M) for the first time in years. Then the iMac alone drove a 25% increase in global total Mac sales in FY99 (also, at the time they estimated that 40% of iMac buyers were new Apple customers, so it wasn't just ""education contracts and a few old Apple aficionados"")

I’ll point out that Windows NT’s PowerPC and MIPS ports had the exact same APIs as on x86 (of course), and Mac OS didn’t change APIs when it was ported from 68k to PPC, nor from PPC to x86, nor x86 to ARM."

Appletalk was still the default protocol you got out of box. Apple was still trying to push their protocols at the time and asking installer to go an buy a Appletalk license for windows machines (lol).

MSFT did learn though. They brought NT up to speed on drivers and such real quick after the ME problems."
2021-05-15 13:48:24,stocks,"There is no confusion. I am simply looking at it from bird eye view.

A OS API's at the time were built on top of whatever language you are provided by the hardware. The OS API then provided 99% of what you need to function within an OS assuming common hardware. So for example, if you want to thread, you do that via API rather than go make your own functions in x86, etc. So at the end of the day you are dependent on the performance of the API and you assume that the OS will maintain their API by bug fixing and improving efficiency.

The APIs were most certainly not exactly the same. I have no idea what you are saying there. Just because they look same to a high level programmer doesnt mean its the same under the hood. Under the hood the libraries are very different. What might be a five liner for a CISC based API might be 500 lines on a RISC based API and performance would be vastly different too even when running the same exact code on top.

This is exactly why RISC struggled back then. It turns out that the extra code complexity bogged down any architectural advantages. Over time we overcame this but also CPUs changed a lot. There is really no such thing as RISC/CISC any more."

She has $50K cash sitting in a low-yield savings account. Her goal is to probably give money to her 3 kids when she dies as she's able to get by from social security and her birth country's pension (dual-citizenship).

Subreddit wikis just talk about pre-retirement portfolios.

Obviously her risk tolerance is low as she's old, so she'd ideally want her portfolio to be conservative, but with yields higher than your average high-yield savings account or CD.

2021-05-14 20:47:32,stocks,"Yeah it kinda seems too good to be true I'd agree but I think it's worth a position, even if not a tremendously big one.

I for one started out by putting in 5k€ when I first read the DD of the dude who put in like 5 million freedom coins.
It seems like free money tbh.
I personally found the states that institutions have taken up to now pretty encouraging.
Furthermore the stock is trading with astarys already being FDA approved + level 4 drug so MUCH uncertainty is already gone but the stock hasn't moved much.

Once sales start happening that is 100%ly going to change!
The question is: will they start happening?
I think they will. The CEO and team have a proven history in this field and a bunch of private equity family offices have already developed huge positions.

The good thing about micro caps is that really big players can't take positions easily, thus making ""efficient market theory"" more difficult to work.
What I mean by that is basically that it's much easier to find an undervalued stock sub 500mill MK just because it's easier for institutions to invest in the bigger once.
They just don't bother doing research for the smaller ones.
Generally retail has the edge here but it's MUCH more risky.

I have expanded my position to about 11k€ and I have more money (5k) being wired to my brokerage ATM for another entry because I am quite bullish.
Would put more in but it's not rational to overweigh a position that theoretically is really speculative.

Financials are sweet with 0 debt and the cash that is being burned each quarter is practically nonexistent (1m).

Furthermore you got 73$million dollars CASH as of 31.3 not counting the 2x10mill that came in milestone payments since then, thus making it just short of a 100mill in cash right now.

You buy a 250mill MK company that has 100mil in cash.
This basically means that their drug portfolio is being priced at about 150mil right now which seems really fucking low to me considering the drugs that are still in pipeline and the ones that have been approved.

Astaryz has the potential to make this thing a buyout candidate or alternatively at least quadruple stock price in my humble opinion. 
1billion mk would not be overpriced for a company that can potentially generate 560m in payments from one drug alone which is being distributed by a very knowledgeable team with a bunch of know how in the field.

All over the internet I see people praising the stock and banks consistently raising their price targets. Currently SQ has a PE ratio of about 250. Net income is expected to grow around 45% a year. Lets say net income consistently increases by 50% each year and the price stays flat at $200. Then it would still take 7 whole years for it to reach a reasonable PE below 20.

&#x200B;

Now I know PE isnt everything, and the market can be irrational. But how is it even possible that this company is valued this high, and according to analysts price targets it still has at least 50% upside? Am I missing something here or is its valuation only kept this high with irrational hope?

&#x200B;

Edit:

Just adding a few other ratios that make it seem overvalued to me:

PEG: 5+

PB: 40

Debt to equity: 162%

I know investing is not as easy as just looking at a few ratios and calling it a day. But what is it I am missing that causes Square to have a nearly 100B valuation?"

Modern problems require modern solutions.

You are welcome"
2021-05-14 21:05:18,stocks,"I think SQ is ahead of itself, but look beyond ratios to truly assess a growth stock. What are they spending on, and what do the margins look like? Their margins will tell you how much of that revenue may flip to earnings more than today’s actual earnings will.

The major concern for me with SQ is that revenue has been pumped with low margin bitcoin trading, but the counter to that is their point of sale should pick back up this year. They will forever be a company/stock I can’t make my mind up whether I love or hate, because I can convince myself that it could crash or 4X from here, so I just stay away."
2021-05-15 01:50:58,stocks,"Your scenario of 50% growth over the next 7 years doesn’t take into account how economics of scale can improve their margins in order to grow earnings much faster than their 50% revenue growth rate.

With a company growing this fast, it’s difficult to value it by traditional P/E. Their gross profit for 2020 was 2.7B, but if you extrapolated their Q4 gross profit across next year assuming no further growth it would be 3.2B.

As a growing company they’re investing in research and development as well as quite a bit in sales. This makes their earnings lower than what it will be when they eventually mature and start returning excess cash to shareholders instead of reinvesting in the business.

Taking the 3.2B in gross profit would yield a fairly reasonable P/E of 31.6. It’s not a perfect estimate since every company will always have some operating expenses, but it gives you some idea of where the company could go especially as they continue to grow and economics of scale come more into play letting their revenue grow quickly relative to their operating expenses.

I’m not super bullish on Square but nevertheless I would not call them extremely overvalued at the current price. Maybe still somewhat overvalued though."
2021-05-15 07:42:54,stocks,"So basically you are paying today what looks like fair value after 7 years (asuming everything goes extremely well)? That not an investment lol. That’s crazyness. The downside is INSANE, future doesn’t always go as expected, in fact it most likely won’t. You want a lower price because of risk and you actually want to pay substantially below what a fair price is expected to be in 5 or 10 year time. In theory, with this example, you will have zero return on your investment for 7 years... all growth stocks slow down eventually, many go out of business, most tech companies that are stars today eventually turn into IBM ..."

2021-05-15 03:52:36,stocks,"SQ has hit its ceiling after the great run.  They didn’t have a lot of fintech competition until recently.  There’s a bunch of fintech coming for them.  I rode SQ from 180 and recently sold them.  Few things have bothered:

120B market cap-  similar to some big banks but way less profitable and overpriced.

Dorsey- hard to do two CEO jobs.  Twitter has suffered.  It’s been the worst performing tech stock since IPO.  How can a tech stock not make anymore the last 5 years?? During one of the greatest bull runs ever.

Bitcoin - I don’t like Bitcoin move.  I feel like the crypto move was just a superficial way to juice earnings.  Same as Tesla.

Tidal- undetermined whether it’s a good move or not."

TWLO is grossly overvalued compared to SQ (P/S of 26 vs 7).

TWLO stock price is due for a lot more pain in the short term IMO."
2021-05-15 01:01:57,stocks,"It's counter-intuitive, but the fact it's a growth stock actually makes it *less* risky.  Since near-term earnings are a relatively small contributor to their valuation, short term economic changes won't affect them as much.  We saw this risk play out during the Covid crash - low P/E value stocks dropped a lot more than growth stocks, because a year's worth of earnings lost is a much bigger deal to a company with 2% earnings growth vs a company with 50% earnings growth where 2020's earnings are almost insignificant.  Since investors demand a bigger reward for taking on more risk, the P/E ratios are lower on riskier value stocks.

The reason this seems so counter-intuitive is that to any of us as an individual investor SQ seems riskier than any value stock because we over-index on stock price.  With SQ there's a chance they don't grow into their P/E whereas with a value stock we can easily see that the P/E makes sense and that they're appropriately valued.  But the market is fully diversified, with a much longer time horizon than us, so it prices purely based on expected outcome.  It doesn't matter to the market if SQ goes bust because the market owns every company and thus they own the company that would take SQ's place.  The market does equally well regardless."
2021-05-15 15:16:48,stocks,I disagree on this digital wallets are just beginning. Square will be a big player in this market than Square is going to have a lot of growth ahead of them. ARKK invest has the digital wallet market at 4.6 T by 2025.

2021-05-15 03:43:46,stocks,"unfortunately, this idea to only apply to the most cream of the crop, the topmost secular winner.

Yeah, if you bought $AMZNfrom 20 years ago, it doesn't matter that much whether you bought it in 1999 at $107 or at $30 in 2000, because in 20 years it has now become a $3000+ stock, you still hold a massive winner even if you bought at the peak bubble.

But unfortunately the same thing can't be said to other stock.

Even other secular winner, like $MSFT if you bought at the top for $50 in 1999. After almost 22 years, it only up to $250 right now. A 8.4% annual return over 22 years for such a huge secular winner.

And let's not talking about another secular winner like INTC or IBM that fare much worse.

The truth is, finding the next $AMZN or $GOOG is very difficult. You might hold a winner, but if it is something like Microsoft then your actual performance still left much to be desired.

The most obvious difference between MSFT and AMZN in 1999 is that MSFT is already a big business with very high market cap, while AMZN is still a small startup.

So your ideas, if anything seems to favor small cap growth stock rather than already large cap growth stock. Seeing that SQ already in the range of $100 Billion market cap, valuation become much more important."
2021-05-15 11:54:03,stocks,"Vine was kept as a slightly separate company after twitter bought them; Vines inability to keep innovating and attracting advertisers is what lead to twitter dropping it.

You can't have a product become the best of the best without adapting  to the needs of the userbase it's gonna start to atrophy to competition.

Shortly after vines launch: Instagram did 15 second videos; there was already snapchat stories and tiktok launched a year before vine ended.

Jack and the rest of twitter can't magically will a competitive business model out of vine if the vine devs (who were kept largely separate) can't manage their own product.It's the same exact thing as skype; MS bought a company that was p.badly mismanaged and had no real ability satisfy the needs of the community.

2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Selling a position before or after 1 year ownership I am hoping someone can tell me if I am thinking about this correctly.

I was pretty new to investing when the market crashed due to covid last year.  I bought a bunch of stocks (eg. CCL, DAL) without too much diligence just because they were down so far and I figured ""hey, this can't last forever!"".  Now as we get into May, most of them are hitting the 1 year point since purchase. 

I am looking to simplify my portfolio and own fewer tickers because I don't feel like I care to be invested in these companies anymore and I can't follow all of them.

Should I try to wait until 1 year after purchase? for instance I have a stock I purchased in June 2020.  If I wait to sell until next month, will I be better off on taxes (understanding that the prices could also move between now and then). My current thinking is if I wait one more month I will save 10% on taxes.

So, this guy claims he never was really the wealthiest guy out there, quite the opposite he was working hard to survive from month to month like most people, saving some small amounts of money to buy himself a car or house over the years. I was actually amazed because everyone knows that at the moment he's a multi-millionaire, so I asked him directly how is this possible that he's a millionaire if he never really got any fortune in his life, and that was the moment he told me   
'son, you're still young, I'll give you the advice I've had got from one of my late old friends back day. Put $100 on stocks every week, that's it. That's not much, you won't even feel it missing, but over the years your money will be stacking, and be growing over the years. That's how I became a millionaire after cashing it a few years ago.'

1) is such a strategy really worth it?  
2) if so what companies are worth putting your money into long term?

2021-05-15 07:26:22,stocks,"I believe AMD is one of the few semi stocks right now, with a growth case that justifies a growth P/E valuation.

I'm not selling what I hold ( did that before and still kicking myself :D ). I am however also not adding atm. Reasons being; 

a) what the ""accepted growth P/E"" for tech is going to be in a higher interest world is still up in the air,

 b) AMD seems rangebound because of the XLINX deal, with limited upside potential, and slightly higher downside potential because of the rotation out of tech, which is still playing out, 

c) downward pressure on the dollar adds currency risk for me as a foreign investor, 

d) statistically and TA-wise, we are more likely to gap-down into the pre-pandemic 50s, than gap-up into the pandemic 90s. Especially as the market already seemed to had priced in the recent blowout quarter ( not just for AMD ). Looks like sentiment rules for now, and not performance or expectations.

P/E contraction sentiment is really what keeps me from adding currently. I don't see the growth case disappearing for AMD in the next few years and financials are constantly improving... stocks may go up, they may go down, good companies , like AMD, will do fine. However, P/E contraction can kill any sector and put you underwater for decades.

So where does the money go when the market turns bearish? Is there any empirical evidence beyond ""Scared money buys gold.""

2021-05-14 23:12:45,stocks,"No its fair. After reading through some good responses, this is making more sense. It's still a trip though. The trick to finally having it click for me is that money never goes into the stock market. The market is just a ledger of transactions that always balances out to 0. 

The thing I'm getting hung up on is trying to understand the significance of the price going up or down in the market and what, if anything, it can tell us about the likelihood of the price going up or down of other investment vehicles. 

Unlike the money supply which can be thought of as a nearly closed system, I'm not confident that overall value is a closed system. At least not such that as it is decreases in one area it must increase in another. If it is a closed system, then I think we get to  place where we need to account for the very real effects related to the velocity of money. 

Someone elsewhere said that the stock market going down meant that people simply lost confidence in the market, but that seems too anthropomorphic. I still think it's a reflection on the decrease in buying pressure which is either made up for in buying pressure elsewhere or the sudden loss to buying pressure (hoarding?). 

Anyway ... I've really enjoyed this thread."
2021-05-14 23:27:06,stocks,"that's a good explanation. thanks!

If we took an even higher perspective where money itself is just an asset that is easily trade-able, we change the question from where does the money go, to where does the value go. This is closer to what I was in-artfully trying to think through. 

To piggy-back on your analogy, if only 2 assets exist in the whole world, does the loss in value of one asset imply an increase in value of the other? With only two cars, does the market's newly found hatred of my Chevy equal their new found love of my Tesla? 

I suspect not, but that's tripping me up too. How does value get destroyed/created? Can it even be destroyed/created or does it just go back to some dark pool without social pricing mechanics (hoarding or just inaction - decrease in the velocity of money?).

Can the decrease in value of the stock market tell us anything about the value in other investment vehicles."

All those people who were happily holding at $100 are suddenly thinking they would be happy to get out at $80 or $70 or maybe just that $60 they paid for the stock last year.  Stockholders hearing the news feel like they have been punched in the gut and are praying, ""Please, Jeebus, let me get out without losing money--or at least not much.""  The stock opens at $50.  Sure there are some trades in the pre-market but the volume of those are insignificant compared to the huge volume from holders desperately trying to get out at the open.  For the vast majority of stockholders the price goes from $100 to $50 with no opportunity to sell at a price in between  

It is not a zero sum game.  If ten billion dollars in market cap was lost when the price gapped down at the open, no one had to sell ten billion dollars of stock.  The $10B did not move anywhere.  It literally disappears as the price potential buyers are willing to pay changes because their assessment of what the company is worth changes, perhaps in an instant."

2021-05-14 23:37:20,stocks,"Enron? 

This is a great explanation. It's amazing how easy it is to not really know the underlying mechanics of the stock market. In this example, at an extreme, am I right to say that the price would stay at $100 until that first person tries to sell it at $100 and can't so they then offer to sell at $99 and can't and so on until someone finally buys it at $50? 

If so ... then technically ... if no one is willing to buy the stock at any price, the stock price is stuck at $100 and yet is simultaneously worthless. It's like Schrodinger's stock?"

2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Opinion on Stock Youtubers So I have been watching stock youtubers for about 2 years now. While I say some are present good information, I believe that some definitely are not teaching good fundamentals and risk management. Especially when I see the thumbnail with 10X stock or some just wanting you to throw your money in any random stock. I believe this will cause the exact opposite of what should happen where you should always do your own research. 

Watching youtubers that have super risky options and stocks creates a confirmation bias to do the same thing as them whereas they have more capital than most of us, and they get paid a lot of money making these YouTube videos via google adworks.
In essence without doing a lot of your OWN research it’s basically gambling and you need to invest more cognitively. 
These youtubers should only be used as a means to get new ideas to look into stocks and not to blindly follow them."

They are more and more pushing their own products, which slightly annoys me. 

They mostly analyse american stocks, which as an european I wish there was something like this for european stocks."
2021-05-15 14:36:23,stocks,"True. If you look at all the subs on each of the hype stock, everything is a screaming buy at every level of price. They cannot all be right. Everythingmoney's premise is you take a lot of risk investing in a high PE ratio for future gains that might never come. If AMZ's growth never materialized, you would have never heard about it from the investors who would have lost money. And for every AMZ who made it, there are 10 Cisco whose value are still below their ATH back in 2000. 

I don't think people on this sub remember how close AMZ were on the verge of bankruptcy from 2000-2004 and Ebay was dominant. Are people seriously thinking that they would have been able to hold AMZ through that period? Gimme a break.

Point is, you can't make investing decision, or any decisions for that matter, based on hindsight. Because, based on hindsight, going all in using margin on GME in Jan 2021 and sell at $500 would have been the best decision ever. Recommending against AMZ was the right decision from a value perspective (and probably is still correct, again, based on value)."

I too have bought into Palantir because i to believe it has huge growth potential. Problem is the market does not agree with me. The stock is almost done 47% since February of this year and down 15% this month. Today it had a rebound but for people has the consensus changed for you. Cathie wood has had a field day loading up in shares. Their March quarter revenue was up 341 million but analysts are still questioning its growth potential.

2021-05-14 22:24:22,stocks,"My 2 cents.  Look at where PLTR was in 2015 from the valuation standpoint and see where it was right before the listing.  https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/23/palantir-has-raised-880-million-at-a-20-billion-valuation/  
 gives you an estimate of how the valuation of PLTR changed from 2015 to  
 the listing.    The valuation change in 5 years before listing(or lack   
thereof) should give us some clues about what is happening now."
2021-05-14 23:11:58,stocks,"I think there are all good points being brought up but we're forgetting one thing: stock price reflects more than just fundamentals. From the looks of it, Karp had built PLTR on a compensation model highly skewed towards stock options and we're seeing the effects of that now. A 600mil exercise out of his billion compensation plan only goes to show the share dilution effects it has. Mind you, I'm all for PLTR and compensation scheme, nothing wrong with employees letting go a little at prices they deem comfortable. Just pointing out an observation."

2021-05-14 23:08:54,stocks,"Still expensive IMO but the outlook is well supported by gov contracts alone. The fundamentals are only questioned because of the insider selling that is mostly driven by exercised options and need to pay taxes. The numbers of shares outstanding is excessive too but sbc will be more of a blessing for this company and IMO well worth the temporary poor stock price. The high this year ($45) was bogus pump and dump shit that a lot on Reddit helped achieve. I think the stock is stabilizing and we’ll see a hard support line around 19-20 for the next few months.

The expansion and revenue increases from the private sector are extremely encouraging. I think they’ll beat their own guidance for ‘25 by ‘24.  I think it’ll trade around 200-250 within the next 10 years."

I'm going to try and keep my convictions through the inevitable ups and downs over the next couple years.

2021-05-14 23:42:48,stocks,Buying stocks is about paying a fair rate for future profits. PLTR is having insane growth. But it is still priced high expecting large future growth. This is fair as I expect the growth to continue. But it is still a little high for my taste even with the growth. In my opinion the fall is less about their growth and more about the market having more realistic expectations about them.

2021-05-15 10:32:47,stocks,I think they are doing very well. They got memed and were overvalued like every other non-FAANG tech stock to boot so naturally they came down. I think they look very good long-term as they themselves have stated and they are aiming for long-term growth. Also do not know why people are shitting on ARK. The shits are up 500% since inception. Whole tech sector was overvalued. Now shit is reset and will go back up. People are nuts.
2021-05-15 12:18:29,stocks,"This is maybe the power of doing your own DD other then reading Reddit posts... The company isn't worth buying over $22 a share. That being said I've bought a healthy amount at 17.20 during the dip and would happily buy more if it goes below $17. 

The evaluation needs to make sense and paying above $22 means you are asking for something nuts like 29 percent year over year growth which is crazy for a company so big."

I’ve been waiting for the right time to add substantially to initial core position. 

I thought anything close to $20 was good enough but sub $20 was such a steal. Absolutely loaded it and feels great to have waited it out.

Meanwhile in this rotation PLTR has been unleashing partnerships and contracts.

2021-05-15 12:02:52,stocks,"You could be right, also consider what they’ll be working on innovating 10 years from now that isn’t even on our radar yet. The long term growth potential of these companies is insane.

It’s not just about hitting targets no one else can hit anymore, it’s about hitting targets no one else can see

Ehang for example has working prototype drone taxis with hundreds of successful passenger flights already, I feel like they’re hitting targets no one even see. Imagine the roads being empty 20 years from now and everyone just gets picked up by a drone whenever they need to get somewhere. It’s all AI controlled airspace so no accidents or collisions, traffic is a thing of the past, solves housing issues and overpopulation since thousands of humans can be stacked vertically in a high rise with no need to for parking space or even roads. This is gonna be a crazy next 20 years"

2021-05-15 11:57:35,stocks,"I think it really depends if the market will accept again high P/S stocks. Due to inflation fear these stocks are being sold off like crazy. While a year ago a P/S of >50 (sometimes over 100) seemed to be no issue at all (everyone screamed valuations don't matter) they definitely started to matter now. A good growing stock with a forward looking 2022 P/S of 20 is now seen as pretty expensive and there are not that many stocks left that have this high of a valuation on forward P/S. Some that come to mind besides PLTR are SNOW and NET amongst a smaller getting list. I really like NET but it's just too expensive for what the market allows at the moment.

So again it comes down to risk appetite for growth stocks and if that picks up again. If growth stock selloff continues I could see PLTR go down to low teens maybe 11-13 which would give it a forward 2020 P/S of around 10.

If we start to party again like its 2020 and valuations don't matter this can easily go back to >30 in no time but I just think these times are over for now.

Just my opinion of course."

2021-05-15 12:26:34,stocks,Pltr has a P/S multiplier of 37 right now based on 2020 revenue of 1 billion and current market cap of 37 bill. Market seems ok with that.
2021-05-14 22:04:45,stocks,"I'm not sure what you're going to gain by doing so, but if you really want to, then go for it."
2021-05-15 09:32:42,stocks,"I'm not denying the irrationality of investors, but Tesla is a growth company and being evaluated as such, Ford is not. Snowflake is a growth company and is being evaluated as such. Palantir is not. Alot of people around here are operating as if Palantir is a growth company, but they've been around for 18 years. Going public was a recent shift. I believe their price is reflective of the fact that Wall Street does not believe they are a high growth company like so many other tech stocks, and I don't think that is going to change without some sustained, highly impressive numbers."
2021-05-14 22:47:19,stocks,"Clearly you didn’t watch their demo day. They’re far far more than a consulting firm. It’s unlikely the US would’ve caught bin laden without palantir. Their programs have so much unrealized potential, uses we can’t even fathom yet"
2021-05-14 22:57:12,stocks,This isnt your field is it? ...
2021-05-15 00:06:21,stocks,So you've got nothing to say
2021-05-15 04:23:48,stocks,someone must’ve bought the 40s and panic sold
2021-05-15 09:39:39,stocks,">Tesla is a growth company and being evaluated as such, Ford is not.

That is reflected in the p/e not the market cap. I 100% understand why their p/e would be nil or very high as they grow but their market cap being 3x the largest car maker in the world makes zero sense. People are paying a growth companies premium on a company that has its next 2 decades prices in."
2021-05-15 03:16:00,stocks,Lmao you probably think Gotham and Foundry are net new technologies rather than reskins
2021-05-15 01:21:29,stocks,"It’s mines. I’m a Systems Engineer with an Accounting degree. Your comment that their SOFTWARE is the same thing on 1970s mainframes shows you’re either just trolling or dumb as a duck.

I say software because algos don’t run on hardware. They run in software. And most software is hardware agnostic. 

That said, PLTR isn’t making magic. They’ve joined a very large industry and need to set themselves apart. What’s holding them back? The lack of commercial contracts. Basically they need a sales team that can hustle and get customers. Lots of customers, to justify the high valuation. 

In the days before TSLAnaires when fundamentals mattered, this would be $10 stock"
2021-05-15 10:44:29,stocks,Can’t believe this out of touch fuck tried to mock me for not working in the industry lmfao. I’ve never heard something as nonsensical as Algorithms being literal hardware in years.
2021-05-15 10:51:57,stocks,"Yea you need to step back.

Mainframes are practically the birthplace of modern big data... /facepalm 

It is when we started to really push, experiment and develop the basis for modern data algos and network algos. What we learned from them allowed us to create the 1st efficient (aka non-bank breaking) microcomputer.

Algos are almost always designed to optimize limitations to hardware. Thats the hard part and where you get major performance boosts in big data. You literally want to design your hardware around a algo to optimize if you can. Or you design your algo entirely around the physics of the hardware... The fluff you do post hardware is nothing. Just basic structures. Freshman stuff and all very well known.

So in other words, Palantir isnt doing anything major aside from implementing well known stuff to create their own libraries. In other words, they are creating yet another set of libraries for data output because we dont already have 10 for every major language and database... Nothing wrong with that, but its a bit of a stretch to think they are innovating. They arent. But they may still get some customers but its a hard sell at this point hence the high cost of acquisition."
2021-05-15 00:00:00,stocks,Will someone explain how averaging up is good for ROI? If I buy a share at $1. It does well and increased to $2. I then buy another share now at $2.50. My cost basis now increased to $1.75. Why is this a good move as an investor? It seems you wouldn’t want to invest again once you’ve already invested.
2021-05-15 10:41:37,stocks,"I bought PENN at $28. It recently went down to $77 after hitting $140. The upside is so high for it and I am extremely confident in the company. Moreover, I do not ever see them going back to $32, so I bought more shares and averaged up to $32. I bought FB at $40 and I am thinking about buying a lot more now at $315. Who cares if I average up to 80 or 100 dollars when it will be at $600 in 4 years. Do the math...the new money I put in will still make more money than if I kept it at the old amount with a lower cost basis. The main thing for you to think about is whether or not you think you are in danger of breaking below your newly intended upsized average and whether or not that danger could be permanent. As for my examples above, I feel almost zero danger and only upside. However, I did not exactly know this when I bought originally because they were newer companies. Now I know and want more. Only time you should average up while teetering on even is if you are straight bullish like never before. I bought HITID at .4 and kept averaging up to .55 and I have been in the red up until Thursday. I do not care because I think the company could 50x in 5-6 years and .4 or .55 or .8 even will be a joke soon. Finally, it is prudent to build a position over time and sometimes the more you read and the more time that goes by, the more bullish you get."
2021-05-15 12:29:54,stocks,"Conviction doesn't care about previous price.

You like a stock, it has room to grow, then buy it, if you think it's capped or too high, don't buy it. Doesn't matter if you got 1 stock at 1 dollar and your next is going to be at 10, if there's room to grow to 20, you'd want to buy it, right?

Averaging down is just a term for people who bought in at a peak and want to sell at a lower point. ""Averaging up"" doesn't exist."

I believe the settlement date is just when the transaction gets settled, for most transactions I think that's 2 to 3 days. It's not that they covered the short, the short transaction itself was just settled.  I could be wrong on all of this. That's how it was explained to me though."

2021-05-15 09:11:32,stocks,"what's with all the angry boomers here?

a few things that make NIO unique and an obvious long term hold:

* cult like following in China (sort of like Tesla in the US)
* innovative battery swap technology
* expansion into Europe
* EV is becoming a sort of space race these days and China will want to have a company that can be mentioned in the same breath as Tesla
* clear industry leader in China when compared to peers like LI and XPEV
* the chip shortage has weighed on the stock recently and it will abate as the supply side of the economy catches up to the demand side
* clean energy is a long term theme that isn't going away anytime soon. EV is a huge part of how China becomes greener

As for slavery, THE GOVERNMENT looked the other way for political and economic reasons, but there were many people who advocated for Abolition as early as the founding of the United States.  As for the Jim Crow era that was not the official policy of the US government, who was attempting to fight Civil War Part 2, and you forget to mention it was Federal troops that ended Jim Crow segregation.  As for killing millions of Native Americans, that’s a centuries old series of wars of conquest.  Americans aren’t the first technologically advanced society to abuse their neighbors who don’t have the logistics to maintain their way of life.  So, no, I’m not ignoring it.  I’m also not retelling a one sided revisionist version of history, the fact you can even make your accusations without fear of repercussions is a political miracle and anomaly.  The fact you can do so on a cellphone or computer is a technological miracle.  Both of those miracles are directly attributable to American innovations in politics and science.

Firstly, it’s simply not true that people can’t object because they themselves have pasts.  Could it be hypocritical?  Sure.  Has that stopped people from time immemorial.  Not a bit.  Secondly, what if the criticism is fair?  Should no one ever try to improve the behavior of their friends, families, or neighbors because they themselves have failed in previous situations?  
Even the prosperity you cite was partially enabled by American trade policy, and Chinese theft of intellectual property.

What I think is that if we want any kind of moral standing to speak out against another country we have to be actively acknowledging and improving on our own shit. For example, what's happening right now in Israel, that's happening with direct US support, both publicly and logistically ( we gave and sold them the weapons, and we cover them from reprisal via the UN or NATO), is as bad as anything that's happening inside China.

What counts as illiquid? Companies that ark has high ownership in?

You know that the average market cap by weight is over 100 billion in Arkk."
2021-05-15 11:56:34,stocks,"Illiquid Investments are securities or assets that cannot be easily sold or exchanged for cash without a substantial loss in value. Illiquid investments cannot be sold quickly, because of a lack of ready and willing investors to purchase the assets or securities. She routinely is selling stuff like Apple so that she can buy more of these holdings, because if she doesn’t then the value plummets and they see heavy outflows. Everyone wondered why she was buying more the the average daily trading volume for these positions,  it’s pretty easy to understand now.

From a quick google search I see NVTA, CGEN, SSYS, XONE, ONVO, SYRS, CERS, PSNL, NTLS, EDIT from back in March and it’s definitely gotten worse since then. She is technically an insider at some of these companies too with a +10% ownership stake. This means her etf has to return any profits to those companies from sale of the stock like less than 6 months after purchase. Pretty much guarantees they won’t ever make money on them.

Their market cap by weight is largely because of Tesla and square. Take those two away and what is their AUM? More importantly, what is the weighted average of investors into ARK within the last year?

2021-05-15 12:38:29,stocks,"You literally just pulled 2% out of your ass, per the article she has a 10% or more stake in 25 companies which makes her an insider. This is text book illiquid.

Ark has a strategy alright, buy up small cap speculative tech stocks above their daily average trading volume and create momentum. It works until momentum goes out and then it’s a rush for the exits.

Do you think her daily investor update is a good strategy too?

In 5 years they won’t be around."
2021-05-15 12:44:21,stocks,"The article is 6 weeks old. The ark funds have been rebalance to higher conviction stocks.

2021-05-15 12:50:06,stocks,"Higher conviction = illiquid. Stop being brainwashed, she can’t ever profit from these stocks. She will always have to sell her cash like positions to keep them trading up. What happens when they run out of cash like positions and have to start selling Tesla, Shopify, square?

The article being 6 weeks old means nothing, their rebalance has been more skewed towards this direction since then. Do you even follow their daily holdings?

I think those companies are grossly overvalued and we’ve seen them start to come back down to their pre covid valuations. What happens to ARK then when their holdings are worth far less?"

2021-05-15 11:41:20,stocks,"Thanks OP, those are some great looking links, I have a question:
What is the relation between lumber futures and the stock price? Is it a direct 1:1  relation?
Any upside to BCC? they have been on the quite a roller coaster, with a stellar EPS  beat this past Thursday."
2021-05-15 12:01:42,stocks,"Good questions. If you look historically, the pure lumber companies (like wfg, canfor and Interfor), their stock price followed the futures price extremely closely. RFP did as well, but had a bit of a buffer (delay) because it historically had a larger part of its income from paper/pulp. LPX even further disconnected from price of lumber because of how much value-added products they now offer. A great way for you to verify yourself is looking at their stock prices vs lumber surge and crash in 2018. 

The problem with 2021 is these companies’s stock prices haven’t climbed in tandem with the rise in cash or futures. Cash and Futures went through the roof the last couple months, these companies rose a bit but not an extra 50%. Infact, except for LPX, all of these companies are stuck at their 2018 high’s or barely above them. Lumber was only 600$ for three weeks in 2018. So futures being down right now doesnt mean these stocks are going to drop like a rock. Except for some skittish investors, The market largely saw this recent increase as a temporary windfall. 

I havent done a deep dive on BCC so I cant comment on their strength’s weaknesses. They had some good margins, but i liked LPX’s numbers better so i gravitated towards them. 

The lumber guys on twitter have called lumber’s top. Keep in mind, those guys said the same shit in January and that proved to be horribly wrong. They maybe right this tome but i wouldn’t treat their many guesses as truth. I think all of these companies have major upsides as long as lumber cash prices stay up above 600/700 into fall. The analysts’ projections (and the market) largely assume lumber crashes to barely above prepandemic levels q3 and q4. If we get to august, and lumber still steady and high, we will see major upward revisions to PT’s and the bear thesis holding back falls apart. Thats when i think these companies’s get their next big boost. But time will tell."
2021-05-15 13:53:54,stocks,"So I am an architect in Texas and we are seeing a record demand for single and multi family housing. I spec a lot of WY and BCC wood products like trusses and LVLs. 
The housing demand has an year of juice because of the time to construct a new home. If an of Biden’s infrastructure bills see the light, demand will be excessive.
Thanks for the DD OP."
2021-05-15 14:38:02,stocks,"Peter lynch always said the retail investor has the advantage because they can see the trends before it shows up in the charts wall street relies on. 

As long  as housing/renovations booming like crazy, these companies will keep making record profits. So if you are seeing crazy demand for new homes and renovations, that’s really 90% the DD you need. These sources are just to make sure other people seeing the same thing you are and avoid confirmation bias."

Now let's say this year there is some sort of big ""inflation fears"" and people start hating on the stock, and it unfortunately drops down to 125$, **but** microsoft actually keeps the exact same earnings as before.


Is the dividend likely going to remain 2.24$, therefore doubling the yield %? In theory the capacity of Microsoft to pay out the shareholders hasn't changed, so i'm guessing the yield % will simply increase if the value is artificially decreased."

2021-05-15 16:55:20,stocks,"Dividends tend to be “sticky”, which means companies hate to reduce dollar amount. Check out dividend aristocrats - they paid and increased dividend for 25+ years. Dividend Kings increased dividend for 50+ years, even through multiple market downturns and recessions. So in most cases you are correct - dollar value will stay the same and yield will increase. 

However in times of crisis, companies may reduce or even suspend dividend. For example, Wells Fargo did that after their horrendous scandal with fake accounts few years back. United also used to pay dividends many years ago - no more. 

So it is possible for a dividend to change, but if you are picking a dividend aristocrat it is extremely unlikely because they will get booted of the list and they would hate that."
2021-05-15 16:55:29,stocks,Good question. You could probably figure this out by seeing how the dividend payments correlates with the stock price and earnings for a given company. I'm sure those studies already exist. I'd like to understand the relationship too.

2021-05-15 10:01:03,stocks,"Ty for your perspective. I just never understood the jest of dividend stock investing.

If you´d compare dividend payments vs stock growth from for example a broad market ETF then dividend stocks are underperforming. 

Next to that, you are paying a higher tax rate compared to capital gains from stock growth. And going further you are carrying higher risk by having less diversification. A company can also lower its dividend payments during bad years. 

I am not judging your choice though! To each their own ofcourse, its just confusing to me."

Here's a tip on sarcasm - what you are saying shouldn't be true"
2021-05-15 10:05:32,stocks,"It also depends on how taxes work in your country, in my country it can actually be better to get dividends over time rather than selling 1 stock 10 years (at a higher price) later because we have “brackets” on capital gains taxes (if that makes sense). I am also in some index/ETF that follows the world index and a small position in S&P 500 ETF these I intend to keep building on. In summary: a combination of dividend/value stocks and ETFs is what I am doing atm. As I learn more I might make changes (started last year) :-) generally my stocks overperform on red days and underperform in green days- I like my portfolio given how much of a pessimist I am lol"
2021-05-15 10:19:35,stocks,"In US long term Capital gains tax is the same as qualified dividend tax. For couples making between $80k and $500k it is 15% for both. 

I am mostly in VTI but have some blue chip dividends as well. First to diversify away from tech - I know, blasphemy :). But top holdings in VTI are so tech heavy that having some more stable companies doesn’t hurt. Additionally, I am bullish on oil.  And those are some crazy dividends along with potential growth. 

Also, I am planning on using these div stocks to eventually supplement my income. So I don’t have to sell and realize capital gains tax when that happens. I will just keep taking my div and start using it."
2021-05-15 01:27:46,stocks,"Read my comment again, slowly. You should pace your reading in tandem with the speed of your brain."
2021-05-15 11:44:23,stocks,"Youre right that selling 1 stock 10 years later might have worse tax implications than dividend stocks. But in those 10 years the expected outcome is also worse than an index fund. What about selling shares every quarter instead of 10 years later? You'd still be paying less tax than dividends

What are the benefits of receiving dividends every quarter compared to selling shares (equal to the value of alternative dividends) of your ETF every quarter?"
2021-05-15 10:46:14,stocks,"But the difference is that you are paying tax on the full amount of received dividends. While for selling shares you'd only pay tax on the proportional amount of gain.

Also VTI is tech heavy because its positions are relative to their individual market cap. It tracks the market. You are effectively taking away diversification by buying 'stable' companies.

Why would you want to supplement your income with dividends over selling shares of a broad market ETF? You are still paying more tax on those dividend stocks"

2021-05-14 23:17:47,stocks,"Once you identify the rotation is beginning/happening, you can buy ATM puts to protect some of your gains by profiting from the drop on your puts. You could then sell your puts for a profit once the price drops. All the while, you still hold your shares, letting the clock run to get to one year. Hopefully, you’ll still be in the green once the one year mark is hit and that portion of gain would be taxed at LTCG rates. The gain on the put would be presumably short term unless your buying LEAP puts and hold those for a year.  Doing this can help protect your overall gain, but it does usually convert some (or all) gain into short term depending how far the underlying drops. You may be able to hold onto your shares long enough for the next cyclical rotation to get going to where your underlying might start going up again."

not sure if this is what you're getting at, but if you want to buy mutual funds (not ETFs) there are still companies that do it all with paper/snail-mail.

Now $MSOS hasn’t been performing all that well since it spiked prematurely back in February but the barrage of daily good news on the legislation front + all the stellar earnings reports have to eventually create positive movement . Biggest problem might be that US companies aren’t allowed to list on US exchanges and that $MSOS isn’t well known enough yet but they are holding very solid companies. Trulieve, Curaleaf, and Green Thumb alone make up over 30% of the ETF and they’re all killing it right now.

- because the stock pays higher dividends than the S&P 500

- because the stock is undervalued 

- because the stock is *not* included in the S&P 500 or VTI, and you want to diversify

- because the stock has low volatility and you want to mitigate risk

- because the company is durable and you believe established firms are more reliable than trendy hot stocks

- because you don't trust Standard and Poor's after they lied about bond ratings and helped crash the economy in 2008

- because you don't trust the construction of index funds, which tend to skew towards hot/trendy stocks and can neglect other types of companies. Robert Shiller of Yale thinks index funds can be pseudoscience that over-emphasizes computer models and neglects to analyze individual companies

It's the dividend aristocrats who will be paying the same dividend they always have. Or if you're doing bond ETFs that's basically like a dividend that gets you more bonds for cheaper."

2021-05-14 20:28:30,stocks,"look up ""Archegos""

VIAC is victim of forced selling because Archegos is too leveraged, meaning the holder doesn't actually want to sell, but it was forced by the margin call.

Unlike many of the name i mention, VIAC is established business (already profitable) that keeps growing.

I feel like you can't make mistake buying it at this price. They also pay dividend $0.96 last year, so about 2.5% dividend yield, not big, but should be enough price to make you wait."

2021-05-14 20:01:50,stocks,"I thought I’d give you a little update on what I did today since you seemed interested in my strategy. I sold the March 2023 $70 LEAP for $5,960, which was a small $60 profit. My goal is to buy a new LEAP with an expiration another 3 months out and a strike 5 points higher. I figured adding another 3 months will allow more time for AAPL to reach its target price so I’m raising the strike a small amount to account for that. I think it will be worth it especially if the stock drops and I can get in at a better deal than where I sold today. 

So at this point I’m hoping to pick up the June 16, 2023 $75 call at a price of $5,500 or better, hopefully next week. I think if I can get in at that price I will have a better option than the one I sold today, all things considered. And I’ll have an extra ~$500 towards buying a third LEAP if we continue to see some lower prices in the future. So if AAPL never again dips below ~127.5 you’ll know I screwed up big today lol."
2021-05-14 23:04:10,stocks,"Thank you, appreciate the update. I was so close to buy the June 2023 $100 LEAP for 32.50 on Wednesday, I got scared of the market and set my buy limit at 32.20. I would have sold it either Thursday or today but the order was not filled. This market is so volatile I would not be surprised to see AAPL dip to lower $120s again. If not, I'd be happy for your other LEAP and maybe I will write a covered call at some point. I'm trying to get out of my DIS LEAPS but the earnings tanked it. AAPL seems to be a much better bet if I get my entry price right. Patience patience, I have to keep reminding myself :)"
2021-05-14 23:43:24,stocks,"Yeah getting in at $32.50 would have been pretty nice. I thought I timed it perfectly on Tuesday morning till Wednesday happened haha. My whole portfolio was down $10k at one point. 

I actually set my limit to sell the $70 strike way earlier in the day today. My plan was to sell it, and then hopefully buy the $75 June 2023 the same day. The sell executed with 5 min left in the trading day and by the time I saw it I had literally 1 minute to place an order so obviously that wasn’t happening. I’m hoping it takes a quick (temporary) dive Monday morning so I can get back in and won’t have to live with the doubts of my decision for much longer lol.  

But as you said, I have enough in Apple that I should be happy either way at this point."
2021-05-15 07:02:54,stocks,"Good luck! Honestly swing trade LEAP maybe a good idea.  be patient, don't fomo, if fomo back, get out with profit quickly. I will try to see if this strategy works :)"
2021-05-14 22:05:19,stocks,What role do you think the federal government played in the housing crisis by mandating financial institutions extend mortgages to people who couldn't afford them?
2021-05-15 08:13:13,stocks,"Let me put it in simpler terms for you:

They may have forced the institutions to essentially become market makers of mortgages.  But they did not force them to bet so much of their portfolio on each order they're obligated to fill.

And unlike market makers, these institutions did not delta hedge with the orders/mortgages they filled, when they should have to *minimize risk*."
2021-05-15 08:47:21,stocks,"You're conflating two different parties here. The lending institutions were forced to give out shit mortgages <---this was the problem. Those financial institutions decided rather than let those shit mortgages destroy them, they would package them up as derivatives and let institutional investors get greedy, thereby relieving them of the risk. 

That was all fine until the homeowners did exactly what the lenders knew would happen - started defaulting on loans. Then the cascade began, causing deleveraging throughout the system. **The seed of the problem was government forcing banks to give mortgages to people who couldn't afford them**. Of course the banks being forced to do that are going to try and minimize their risk, and that is how the mortgage derivatives came about."
2021-05-15 09:27:03,stocks,"Yeah, that's why the banks/lenders got the bailouts; because they ""weren't"" the ones overleveraged to lose all their money on something they'd ""knew would happen"".

Keep deflecting."

I agree with the prevailing sentiment here that all of these types of services face significant regulatory challenges. I doubt that's going to wipe them off the face of the earth in the short to medium term. I think we are still at least a decade or two out from legal autonomous driving.

Time for DASH- clear loser in my opinion. Revenue growth seems to be making a good impression on the street but every other factor is worse than their competition. Recent change to merchant pricing structure in response to COVID complaints adversely impacts the end consumers, who will be flocking to in-person dining over the next few months. Final lock-up for insiders ends beginning of June, plenty of time before the monthly put options expire, which are heavily weighted towards the stock going down.
