2021-06-04 19:33:26,stocks,Partial fill maybe?
2021-06-04 19:45:53,stocks,"As I think of it, if I place buy order for say AAPL at $200, well above current $125, they will execute it at market. If you are unlucky and near send of day and there are no other sellers than say 1 at $190, then you get it at $190. Yikes
I place my limit buy orders below current price hoping to scoop some up on a surprise dip."
2021-06-04 19:46:56,stocks,It’s shows not shoes
2021-06-04 19:42:52,stocks,"“A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock at a specific price or better. A buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower,” 

if it fills lower then that’s fine but it’s saying it filled at the price it never reached. So from what I’ve been reading i shouldn’t have ended up with them"
2021-06-04 19:47:33,stocks,And i believe that was my mistake unknowingly… kinda sucks but it’s a long term thing anyway so it’ll be straight just tryna maximize it rn and not too sure wtf actually happened lol
2021-06-04 19:47:57,stocks,Thanks papa
2021-06-04 19:48:13,stocks,"What was the price of your limit buy order and what price range did the stock trade at today low to high? If the stock traded lower than your buy price at any point during the day, chances are some or all of your order got filled."
2021-06-04 19:50:54,stocks,It seems like i just misunderstood how it worked. Didn’t realize it would fill any point lower than my buy order. Seems to me that it got filled pretty much right after i filled it way higher than i was expecting it to so as it decreased all day i had already screwed myself and i just immediately lost money
2021-06-04 19:53:21,stocks,"You are over thinking.  If your stocks average a 10% return each year it is compounding.  I.e.  your stocks are worth $5,000 this year, go up to $5,500 and the next year you make $550. Etc....

Of course the market never moves in a linear way like that but that is in essence the same thing

As your account value grows you make more money averaging the same % returns."
2021-06-04 19:29:25,stocks,No. You should see if your broker has a dividend reinvestment program such as DRIP for TDA
2021-06-04 19:41:13,stocks,"Compounding is a term often misused. It doesn’t apply to stocks that just increase in value while retaining the same share count. 

Things compound when gains are used to purchase and thereby increase share count, which in turn generates proportionally higher gains, leading to another reinvestment, on and on. Hopefully share value is also simultaneously increasing. 

You need dividend producing equities for true compounding. Otherwise the growth of an equity is just due to price inflation (also good, obviously)."
2021-06-04 19:37:07,stocks,If you are reinvesting dividends you are not selling the stock but are receiving the the dividend and using it to buy more of the same stock. The dividend received is taxable. The stock already held isn't until sold.
2021-06-04 19:59:44,stocks,"Oh god wait a sec.

It’s compounding because it’s expressed in % right? Like stock worth $100, growth 10%, new price is $110,  then next year growth is still 10%, the stock value is $121.

Math :("
2021-06-04 19:40:42,stocks,"Isn’t that about dividends? What about stocks’ value surplus?
I live in Europe, so I don’t think I have those options. I use T212 and it offers “savings” pie investments which I do use, and that should have automatic reinvestment, but for my individual stocks, idk."
2021-06-04 19:53:26,stocks,"Then my compounding, say for example in APPL, wouldn’t be 30% each year of value growth, but only the % equal to div yield. That is if I never sell.

If I were to sell and rebuy, would my compounding be %value growth + %div yield?

I feel quite dumb rn, never looked into it"
2021-06-04 19:47:31,stocks,"I’m extremely confused. Most of my stocks don’t have dividends, am I not going to have compounding?

Also, they always use the S&P as an example which is roughly 8% annual growth. However, isn’t that % relating to the value surplus and not dividend? I’m sure almost no stocks offer 8% dividend"
2021-06-04 19:58:20,stocks,what exactly do you think selling and rebuying does other than get you a tax bill?
2021-06-04 19:35:04,stocks,How did they already complete the year 2021?
2021-06-04 19:08:59,stocks,"Thanks for the DD. I, too, have JOAN, not as much as yours but whatever. I purch b/c I believe in the brand. I have a good friend in the textile arts industry and she mentioned the growth she’s seen even before COVID. That’s all I needed."

2021-06-04 18:58:05,stocks,"The way some of these comments were going I would've thought I was in r/wsb (which I'm subbed to and absolutely love)

Take it for what you'd like

Edit: been diamond handing 130 shares of GME since February so also take my advice as you'd like."
2021-06-04 19:55:44,stocks,"You learned the wrong lesson and you're going to get rolled by the market again.

The lesson you need to learn is: follow your plan.

Greed is only one of the ways you can potentially fuck up. The other is panic and exiting a trade too early. Are you going to learn that lesson the hard way too, then write a reddit post about it? Or are you going to realize that the real lesson is to *stick to your plan*?"
2021-06-04 18:53:44,stocks,You learned not to trade options on a meme stock?
2021-06-04 18:55:10,stocks,"No, I think trading options on a meme stock is fine. As mentioned, the stock performance as I predicted (heavy short term) but I got greedy.

I think the real lesson is in options trading, it might be good to take profits as you don't keep shares if you're wrong. You lose it all."

i dont think you can buy the HK shares with an American brokerage account but might be wrong."
2021-06-04 18:56:53,stocks,"Thanks man. I saw that site in my googling endeavors and that site is discussing the difference between BABA and the HK listed shares called ""9988"". Nothing there lists that BABAF is equivalent to 9988."

2021-06-04 17:18:58,stocks,"EMQQ is close to what you're looking for. It's an ETF focused on internet and e-commerce companies in emerging markets. Just note that nearly 60% of fund is allocated to Chinese companies. You could then pair it with an ETF like VNM which is VanEck Vectors' Vietnam fund.


There is a frontier markets ETF (FM), but 50% of it is financials and real estate, a far cry from technology."
2021-06-04 17:40:08,stocks,"I'd be curious to hear why you think Vietnam and Indonesia are good bets. 

I've traveled to Vietnam. Beautiful country and lovely people."

Edit nvm just saw the tech part"
2021-06-04 17:41:51,stocks,"The VNM is mostly Real Estate too (30%), so that's out. I checked out EMQQ I really like the 60% Chinese focus, but their holdings are similar to what I own already in another ETF (ZGRO.TO) and it's only 6% tech, most of it Consumer Cyclical stocks and Communication services. I guess what I want doesn't really exist as an ETF. I wonder why that is..."
2021-06-04 18:00:53,stocks,"I have a feeling about China's neighbours, that they may sell out to China in the next few years once it becomes more apparent what the Chinese have been up to in the tech sector. I picked Vietnam and Indonesia because of their large, booming populations (and also because they are not immediate US allies)."
2021-06-04 19:43:45,stocks,Thanks anyways :)
2021-06-04 18:05:43,stocks,"> they may sell out to China in the next few years once it becomes more apparent what the Chinese have been up to in the tech sector.

Not sure I understand what you mean"
2021-06-04 18:32:41,stocks,"It is political, but I think China is misleading the entire planet, especially its neighbours. I used to live in mainland China for a year. I learned quite a lot from them, including their language, and business style. In any case, their tech will become desirable, similar to how Turkey's drones are now attractive to countries like Poland, Ukraine (neighbours). Eventually, even Taiwan will sell out to China and begin buying their weapons (instead of the US). Even South Korea and Japan will sell America out in the end. It's still too early to spot, but it's something to look out for. I just want to get ahead of all that, if at all possible. But like I said, it's geo-political stuff."
2021-06-04 18:34:17,stocks,The only way Taiwan buys weapons from China is if China has invaded them first.
2021-06-04 18:40:19,stocks,What you saying is incorrect.
2021-06-04 19:08:09,stocks,"Yea, I agree with moist of what OP is saying except this. China won't sell weapons to TW. They are looking to reunify/invade TW."
2021-06-04 19:08:52,stocks,"China will invade Taiwan. First step, The US will have to be distracted by domestic affairs and that will happen. Once Biden is taken to the hospital and his VP takes over, that stuff will begin to materialize. Now we are in the ""that can't happen"" phase and then it will happen and we will move to ""oh my god"" phase."
2021-06-04 17:12:37,stocks,"Glad that I subscribed to your website a few months back. Thank you for today’s summary, and have a good weekend."

2021-06-04 19:39:23,stocks,"Thank you my friend💪

Have an awesome weekend as well"
2021-06-04 16:52:58,stocks,"There isn't a right answer, because a lot of this comes down to what is your investing strategy. And theres a million strategies, and they can all make you money if you do them right. So there is no right or wrong strategy as long as you're making money. 

You just need to know what strategy you're using, and make sure you understand that from the moment you purchase a stock and carry through with that to the moment you sell it. 

It's even okay to implement multiple strategies in a portfolio. Maybe you have a value stock, maybe you did some technical analysis on one, maybe you bought one for long term growth, maybe your using trend following for another, it doesn't matter as long as you know what you are doing. 

That seems simple, but the reason people struggle so much with selling is quite simple, they have no idea why they actually bought the stock. They have no idea what strategy they actually used, and without that they have no idea how to manage the stock once they own it.

So figure out what strategy you're using to buy a stock first. Then use that strategy to determine if you should sell it."
2021-06-04 17:33:12,stocks,"Beating the market for 1 or 2 years isn't unrealistic especially for Google

2021-06-04 18:35:03,stocks,"You need a system to determine when you think a stock is undervalued or overvalued and base your adding/holding/trimming decisions on that.  Even if you just following a resource you trust.

For example; Morningstar currently considers Google as 16% undervalued and considers Apple as 9% overvalued.  Be careful using random analyst ratings as those can be highly biased."

2021-06-04 19:59:45,stocks,"I look at a lot of ""investors"" and really don't understand how they think. It is very simple when you look at it. You buy Stock A because its cheap compared to what you think price wise will reach. Once it reaches that price or if the upside is very low you sell and buy Stock B that has bigger ROI upside than holding Stock A.

I have a friend who has owned Blackberry for 4 years now. I have made more in 1 year than he has in 4 years.holding BB. When BB surpassed $28 couple months ago he still didn't sell it and now the stock is much lower than at that time"

2021-06-04 18:16:32,stocks,"I agree. I'll admit I don't have an exit strategy, I bought google when it dipped into 1700 something, since I hadn't seen it that low since a while and I had extra cash which I knew would yield 0$ in a checkings account. I thought 10-20% should be easy in a year atleast. But I never buy with a target sell price and that has hurt me before. 
I honestly don't need the money it can stay there, but I was wondering if it could be optimized by diverting into a good, stable, but beat down stock (like AAPL)."
2021-06-04 17:56:25,stocks,Wow seems long haha. Looking forward to it
2021-06-04 17:28:28,stocks,Yup that's why Google has increased $5000/share over the last 5 years.
2021-06-04 18:07:07,stocks,"Sure it will.

That's not realistic.

Having said that, it absolutely could this year. It's basing for the third time now in the last 7 months and with the previous two times it based, it broke out. Got close to breaking out today actually. 

There's no law that says that it can't do what Apple or Amazon did last year. I did think about taking some gains but for now I'm in ""while it's working, don't change it"" mode."

You must have never experienced a bear market."
2021-06-04 18:32:47,stocks,"It sounds like you also don't have an entrance strategy.

Buying something because you think it'll go up is the summary of every investment strategy, but, and this is a big but, what is telling you it'll go up?

Is it a valuation? A trend? A growth? A pattern? Quality? What is telling you the price will go up? 

You need to know that.

Then you need to know over what period of time. A week, a month, a year, a decade, or to be concluded?

That is how you know when to sell. 

You can not, absolutely cannot, have a real exit strategy, if at first you don't have an entrance strategy.

So you said you expected 10-20% return in a year?

Okay....why? What told you that? What metric did you use to reach that conclusion.

That's important to know because now you want to know if you should sell, well you look at that same exact metric....what is it telling you?

If you just threw out a guess, then selling is a guess. Then none of this matters and you're just guessing and why are you even asking for advice? Flip a coin and move on. You have two choices anyway, up or down, heads or tails. 

Nobody can tell you if it's better to sell and buy Apple, because they don't know your strategy, and you can't tell yourself it's it's better to sell and buy Apple because you don't know your strategy."

The city we live in now, our home went from 285 to 480k in 5 years and we don’t really live in a good neighborhood (high crime)..

Now, building a new place is something we have planned but we priced it out and we would end up absolutely screwed. The build cost of the new house went up $125k in the past year or so and the lead time to build is 8-10 months!
It’s just not worth it. Sure, the sale is a win but to buy back in would leave us in debt."
2021-06-04 17:51:54,stocks,Just wait... unsustainable. Home prices will fall...might need to wait a year but it’s foolish to buy a house at these levels.  Houses in my area were $280k last summer now going for $380-$400k.   Wages are not up.....interest rates rising will slow buying...there will a lot of homes being built as construction costs start coming down.   Rent...save cash and buy at the right time.

2021-06-04 17:24:40,stocks,"The housing shortage was a decade in the making.  Post great recession builders were scared to invest and those who wanted to build couldn't get capital to start construction.  What was being built was multiunit (i.e. apartments) in urban centers albeit not at the rate needed to maintain affordability.

With COVID, people abandoned all those new expensive apartments in congested cities and started bidding wars on what few single family homes were available.

There will be more inventory coming online with foreclosures once forbearance ends but it won't be a flood. Just a little relief to slow down the current price appreciation.

As you mentioned, with the cost of raw materials super high and rising wages new homes won't provide relief from current prices.

The one thing that will help is baby boomers dying and only if immigration doesn't pick up. Boomers are expected to start dying in notable numbers towards the end of this decade and into 2040. If immigration picks up, then even estate sales won't provide enough supply to meet demand.

Moonshot is 3D printed homes.  There are a couple projects where the houses are partially printed.  Those cut down on material costs and labor.

Good luck house shopping. If you wait for rates to rise, it's typically a better return if you buy during high inflation than during low rates.  Buyers have more negotiating power when rates are high and when rates go back down you can refinance and ride the wave of home appreciation."
2021-06-04 17:11:31,stocks,"No politician, whether American, British, Australian, Canadian, etc…wants to tackle the soaring rise of housing prices. None of them want to be the ones to push for policies that deflate that bubble because they’d have a huge amount of angry voters. It seems they prefer housing bubbles that punish entrants at the wrong time.

So each one just kicks the can on it, maybe offers tax incentives, etc.

One positive start would be to crack down on the insane number of flippers that gouge the value chain. Does the world need property management companies offering same-day cash to rapid close deals on dated homes? Of course not. Those houses could just as easily be purchased by regular people with the same GCs doing the work, or maybe people would want to just save the money and have laminate countertops.

The problem is, I don’t know how you attack a problem like that from a policy angle. It’s a known weakness within any semi-free market system.

If you don’t believe me, try bidding on any house that’s a little outdated and isn’t a total disaster. You’ll get outbid and outclosed by a flipper or property group."
2021-06-04 17:47:08,stocks,"No. It's a complex market. To call it a bubble, or to simple point to the GFC and say ""same thing"" is certainly a sign of someone who has no idea what is actually happening and is using biases and short cuts in their thinking to form an opinion, just for the sake of having one.

Basically after the GFC they just stopped building houses. Atleast affordable family houses. Most moved into building multi family apartments. It was a business move, because as you can imagine, not a lot of people could actually afford to buy new houses. 

There was also a lot to tightening in Finacial regulations around mortgages and banks, obviously after a crisis of that size. So it became harder to get a loan, which further suppressed the demand. 

Then you add on restrictions placed by cities and municipalities about building, which has frankly gotten crazy. It's a pain in the ass for people to even build, let alone build what they want where they want. 

Also the large number of houses left vacant or simple destroyed after the GFC.

Well demand for houses finally started to pick up, but because of market dynamics, it takes years to bring back the workforce to meet market demand, it takes years to go through the regulatory cycle and get all these permits and legislation figured out in order to build new houses, and then you add on a demand shock like covid, which reduced the amount of houses on the market aswell (fewer people selling during a pandemic if you're wondering), and the natural result in all of this is rising prices as buyers compete over a shrinking supply of older homes. 

This takes time as cities first need to allow people to actually build. Then companies need to attract people back to an industry that was not attractive to work for in over a decade. 

Don't expect the housing market to crash. A lot of people seem to think the market will return to some state of 09-15 for prices and it won't. That wasn't normal, that was an abnormally long bear market for housing. It's important people recognize that. 

Real-estate value has a natural trajectory upward.

However, there will be an eventually catch up of supply to demand and a likely normalization of price appreciation. So the prices may stabilize and begin growing at a slower rate, which is a much more likely scenario, and one that could still take 5 years to play out. 

 But the idea that real estate is just going to plummet again comes from a lot of recency bias. The GFC wasn't a normal event, crashing real estate wasn't a normal event. In fact the reason it happened at all is because of how incredibly reliable and stable real estate was as an asset class that it allowed so much investor confidence to become so incredibly over leveraged to begin with."
2021-06-04 16:39:32,stocks,"I am the unlucky souls who bought a house thinking the right before the last bubble burst and began looking in February after planning a new home purchase for a year. It doesn’t feel right. My last offer before I exited the housing search was for a house priced at 280,000. The asking price, already inflated by the market meant the bank would appraise the house hopefully at 280,000. Someone beat my offer with a 46,000 above ask offer. Meaning whoever bought it paid 40+ thousand over his down payment to purchase. That would while out my entire net worth to do and saving 1% on interest isn’t worth 46,000 to me. Only time will tell what will happen, but for now I am happy investing in the market and signed a lease. I can try again when I can actually look at the houses that come to market"
2021-06-04 17:42:25,stocks,"Hard to comment on what you say since real estate is very local.

You say you see a lot of people buying, so you answered your own question about being able to afford in your locality. 

Big drive up is just lower mortgage rates.  Payments are way less now with 3% and lower loans compared to the 5,6+% mortgages just a few years back. 

To the Texas individual, I mean Texas is hot right now.   Lots of people moving from high value states (CA, etc) so even 400,000 homes aren't considered expensive in their eyes

You won't want my advice, but if you want a house, either you can swing the mortgage payment or not.  If you can then you just gotta cut back and work more to get the down payment.  

With all yhe above said, prices could drop if mortgage rates go up 2 or 3% pretty fast, since the mortgages would be to much then

Best of luck but also, remember that selling the house is expensive, you pay 8 to 10% usually through that whole process as a seller."

 - Price targets themselves are nebulous.   
 - To see if a price target is worth two bits we need to read the corresponding analysis/basis and look at the proponent's track record and or biases.   
 - Therefore pointing to a price target without even saying who made it and reading their arguments is a nothing-burger.   
 - Ultimately everyone has been saying Amazon is underpriced for *months*, but everyone also knows that interest rates and high market instability will hurt it due to its high P/T and how much expectation is already baked in.    
 - So buy/don't buy, but in either case you owe it to yourself to read the PT's actual white paper even if just to understand the timescales and risk involved.    
 - Amazon can be successful **and** you can still lose money when the company is running a 60+ P/E with tens of years baked in. The question is are you going to sit on your hands if they drop 20% during a market event? Are your timescales *actual* in the tens of years?"

2021-06-04 16:06:23,stocks,"The best way to learn accounting principles is through exercises in preparing financial statements - once you’ve gone through trial balance to income statement, balance sheet & CF statements a few times, then from individual accounts to group statements, it all starts to make sense. Just get a basic accounting textbook and work through it.

I would focus on revenue recognition, consolidation principles & preparing cash flow statements - the rest is pretty technical and the kind of stuff even seasoned accountants need to look up

Once you’ve learned the basic principles, the next step is to just read lots of annual reports of different types of companies - the important financial metrics are very industry-specific, so there’s no real substitute to seeing it in action. See what the CFO is focusing on, then cross-reference it back to the financial statements, particularly the cash flow statement. Read a few peer reports and look for common themes."
2021-06-04 16:41:11,stocks,The best book you’ll find are the CFA level 1 curriculum.

I don't have book recommendations here but I've seen it often said on these subreddits that big banks, professional investors, etc have either teams of analysts who are experts in financial metrics, AIs which are able to crunch tons of data, or both. Sure in 1960 you could find a hidden gem combing through financial statements, but as a retail investor it seems less likely today."

However, hardly anyone is focused on the long term. The old trick of investing in large, unpopular companies still works."

You don't need how to all that double-entry bull shit.  Just stick to the basics."

On the institutional side there’s significant cost to trading the biggest one being tax. Small timers don’t think about tax, professionally, your entire portfolio is designed to minimize tax and maximize returns. Every security is purchased to change a portfolios characteristics. 

Idk why people think hedge funds are betting on earnings short term. No professional trades like that lol. That’s just silly, only retail traders do that."

2021-06-04 17:20:46,stocks,"Sure, they aren’t idiots engaging in day-trading - but their definition of long term is not mine. They regularly hold stuff for less than 12 months and even high conviction trades are 4-5 years. They can’t afford to take longer term bets as 2-3 years of under-performance and their investors pull their cash out and they’re done. 

Take this study - average holding period of 17 months, 48 months for high conviction trades - that’s not long term to me.

2021-06-04 18:09:31,stocks,"Long-term capital gains is anything greater than 12 months. 

Anything after 12 months is fair game for the fund. 17 months sounds about right. It is active management after all, need to rebalance. They are looking for high growth. Typical growth doesn’t last too long for companies in this era, especially with very high CAPE ratios."
2021-06-04 18:17:48,stocks,"Exactly. With them focused on the short end of the curve, they leave the field open for those willing to take 10yrs+ bets. If their holding period is less than 5 years, we’re not in competition, so it doesn’t matter if they’re smarter & better resourced than me."

In comparison, TWLO is down 30% from there. 

There isn't much difference, most of the reason the Nasdaq recovered was because of blue chips in April and today the Nasdaq-100 has driven the show (even though other growth names that aren't in it may be performing well), which means it's blue chips again."

2021-06-04 14:19:24,stocks,"So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.  


  
Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.  


  
My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.  


  
How to use it?  


  
1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.  
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).  
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line  
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line  
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line  
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).  


  
You can see example entries here: \[https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/\]([https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/))  


  
This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!  


  
This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:    
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock    
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them  


  
This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).  


  
If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."
2021-06-04 17:27:16,stocks,"You lost Hope in AAPL, because it went down from 127 to 125.😂

It has no momentum at all.  Even on a day like today, it’s done absolutely nothing.  No chance it closes the year above $3500."

Delta will be lower the farther out of the money it is, should be in the ballpark of 0.50 for at the money options, and will approach 1 for deep in the money options.

That said, since you're just going to let it ride to expiration or assignment, I wouldn't pay that much attention to it when writing calls. For your purpose, all it's telling you is how deep in or out of the money you are, which you already know. It would be more useful if you were going to try to buy back the option before it expires or gets assigned, and you need to evaluate relative value changes due to changes in the underlying, time decay, IV, etc."

Container Ships have long-term contracts of two to four years at record-high race locked in unlike crude oil shipping with short-term contracts of 60 to 90 days.

The bill was introduced on Feb 18th and defeated on June 4th.  In this time period, solar stocks have seen dramatic shorted, over 20% of float being short.  I expect a huge jump in share price back to late Feb Early Mar highs."
2021-06-04 13:24:03,stocks,"Eh....that's a simplistic explanation, at best. First of all, the bill wasn't defeated - it's just not advancing this year. It's still a candidate for a two year bill, which means it can advance/pass early 2022 if they find the votes. (For a bit more context: the legislators have been told they need to limit their bill packages to only 12 bills for the remainder of the year. By not advancing right now and moving this bill to the inactive file, they have a chance to resurrect it early next year, rather than trying to advance the bill and having it fail at this point). There were 25 members (out of 80) who took no position on the bill. 

Second, this issue is phenomenally complicated and wasn't explicitly anti-solar. There's a reason the Sierra Club and the NRDC didn't oppose the bill (nor support it). 

Third, this bill was seeking to expedite a process that the California Public Utilities Commission *already has underway*. Most experts agree that the current version of net metering needs to change, and it's a matter of when and forced by whom. Your argument is that this bill being delayed to next year will have solar stocks rebound - but you miss that this was only a gun behind the door to push the process forward slightly faster. In fact, the CPUC is rumored to make a move later this year regardless."

Yea, so one state (sure large state) had a bill that would just take some of the incentives away from Solar, and the bill was always considered a low chance of being passed, and you think this would impact stocks?

Edit: Cause people like to point out GDP of Cali compared to things like India. First the key point was if the bill was never believed to be passed that would have been factored into the price, given the market is forward looking. So saying that the short interest on these companies was a result of this bill, like OP does, really does not make sense. Second please explain how GDP would be a indictor of roof top solar panel demand? GDP is tied to the companies in the state, for roof top solar panel demand you would look at something like single unit owned homes. Which there are approx 8 million of. Still big number. Ok, those three stocks alone that OP lists (which are no where close to the total suppliers of solar panels) have a market cap of $19B. Solar panels have a average life of 25 to 30 years. Average cost to install is $12,500. If ALL 8 MILLION homes said, lets get solar, that would be $4B in revenue a year. (8 million / 25 years \* $12,500)

Look, all I am trying to say is the current valuations of solar panel companies are looking at future global demand, and in that context Cali is a drop in the bucket. I am also not trying to be anti solar here, I own CSIQ stock, and have a ton of the others via a clean energy fund."

>The economy of the State of California is the largest in the United States, boasting a $3.2 trillion gross state product (GSP) as of 2019. If California were a sovereign nation (2019), it would rank as the world's fifth largest economy, ahead of India and behind Germany."
2021-06-04 15:18:20,stocks,">Again, one state, one market

A state that would have the 5th, 6th, or 7th highest GDP in the world if it were its own nation."
2021-06-04 19:57:45,stocks,It probably won't be the last time you buy a dud. I'm bagholding a few things.
2021-06-04 17:40:40,stocks,"Lmao, it's not [bullshit ](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/12/03/solar-panel-recycling-in-the-us-a-looming-issue-that-could-harm-growth-and-reputation/), & I don't have kids, don't see the point in bringing new life into a FUBAR world.  Nice assumptions on your part though.  I do try to avoid plastics whereever possible."
2021-06-04 18:17:08,stocks,Gas turbines dont last  forever either and dont even get started on recycling of nuclear facilities.
2021-06-04 18:31:16,stocks,"That's not a problem with solar, it's a problem with labor. We just finished a multi million dollar facility that had a major pipe leak on an upper floor that flooded the first floor. Do we rip out plumbing? No, we held the contractor responsible and had them refit all the joints"
2021-06-04 19:23:16,stocks,"Seems you're not even looking for a discussion, you're just arguing in bad faith. Solar is a good investment over time and great for the environment, sure if you pick the cheapest workers you get bad results. That doesn't mean solar isn't very profitable because it is even if you don't like it."
2021-06-04 13:48:33,stocks,Your last phrase says it all about your DD
2021-06-04 18:59:30,stocks,"Meme stockers are about supporting company stocks who are being manipulated by hedge funds with large short interest, not based on undervalued businesses and low PE ratios. Its a middle finger to the financial institutions for allowing such predatory behavior with support from the largest institutions including our own government. You need to READ more about meme stocks not WATCH more on the media. R/superstonk has recently released a great correlation article about how specific stocks are being manipulated together by the same party, not random stocks people post about to get rich quick or go super long on. The icing on the cake is that some of these companies like GME and Nokia truly do have potential so its not a bad investment either way"
2021-06-04 17:38:01,stocks,"Satisfying experience? No idea what that even means. You hire a general contractor and they do all the work. All you do is sign a few papers and maybe, if they are good, let you pick inverter and panel efficiency, if you want to. 

The question is cost. How much did you pay?"
2021-06-04 17:51:20,stocks,"The shingle panels are a technical and maintainance disaster and sorry, but they arent aesthetically nicer either. Roof in general, is boring no matter what you do and I think the panels on top actually give it some character. Shingle panels are just more of the same old boring.

But the real problem with those tile panels is 1st, more panels means more things can go wrong. 2nd if something does goes wrong, its a major pain to work with (you have to walk on these things and that is always risky). The electrical wiring for these things is probably a joke. 

I assume these are long strings. How many strings do you get with their inverter and how many tiles per string (this will be ugly). What happens if even one tiny tile gets disconnected? What a pain... first you have to find it (lol that will be fun) and then mess with the wires to replace it, and odds are walking on them will cause even more damage (double lol). And oh yea, if you dont install correctly you can cause water leaks and so on and so on... there is a reason why the big guys dont do this."
2021-06-04 14:20:38,stocks,In a state with a largely eco-conscious attitude as well
2021-06-04 19:44:52,stocks,True the contractor part isn’t solar companies fault I’m just saying this is what people feel. Not that they should.
2021-06-04 19:52:59,stocks,"Oh I’m sorry. I was just discussing it. I didn’t mean to sound like I had those feelings. I probably should have started with people state these factors on why it is bad, but like I said it’s money and regulation that cause these thing.  It is profitable and is getting better every year."
2021-06-04 14:24:17,stocks,"I respect that you think so, but it's undeniable that catching a meme stock before it's a meme stock is probably the best way to come into some serious cheese."
2021-06-04 18:44:25,stocks,"There's a lot more to an end-to-end customer service interaction, and satisfaction with said interaction, than just cost."
2021-06-04 17:58:50,stocks,I went with the Tesla solution which is actually the cheapest out there. $26k.
2021-06-04 18:38:34,stocks,Omg with your last century thinking we'd all still be riding horses
2021-06-04 15:08:31,stocks,And a lot of sunny days.
2021-06-04 15:25:45,stocks,Market cap vs enterprise value is not due diligence nor any explanation towards why the stock is undervalued.
2021-06-04 18:19:19,stocks,"That doesnt sound right. You got 2x Powerwalls? Did they count the incentives into the price? 

I installed several 6kw systems for about $10k the last 4 years and thats before incentives. Those were using expensive micros too. With a central inverter (like Tesla) it would have been around $9k each. The retailers around here charge about $2.25/W so even if I had gone with them (using micros), thats about $13,500k before incentives.

I think each powerwall is about $14k right? So $28k just for those, and only solar was free?"
2021-06-04 15:57:39,stocks,"Thanks for pointing that out. I agree with your point. In this given company's case, I think it's a relevant factor in conjunction with analyst's expected future PE ratio. The industry itself is capital intensive and has high costs of entry. Jinko Solar's enterprise value is indicative of a company that's undervalued. And so is the fact they produce more solar panels than anyone else in the world."
2021-06-04 18:52:52,stocks,Didn’t include the Fed and State incentive in the price above. With Fed tax credit would be about $19k. 2x Powerwall - $17k. Panel cost $9.7k.
2021-06-04 19:01:05,stocks,Is that just the equipment or installation too? I work for solar and thats an extremely weird price. Or maybe they were desperate and eradicated all profit margins on your job

2021-06-04 10:44:28,stocks,"no question theyre going up

only issue is its difficult to profit off it directly in equities. pdbc doesn't really reflect just how much commodities have gone up and its unfortunately the ""best"" etf"
2021-06-04 10:52:03,stocks,"Down hard
Because I invested in the materials etf VAW 
(I think they are going up, but you know how it works)"
2021-06-04 12:33:10,stocks,Up due to COVID and global supply chain issues
2021-06-04 11:15:48,stocks,Up due to inflation
2021-06-04 10:58:09,stocks,"up or down. 

possible flat."
2021-06-04 16:19:56,stocks,"I don’t think it’s difficult to profit directly via equities. I am invested in $UAN, $CF and $YARA (Oslo) where commodity prices (namely urea, ammonia, and gas prices) are the main drivers of company performance."
2021-06-04 15:05:12,stocks,"That's the instrument I use. You can get not terribly deep in the money options for very little premium over their intrinsic value, so I use those to leverage my gains / losses without having to actually use leverage. Only downside is that you lose a bit on the spread. Not too much, though. Maybe $0.20."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,Barkbox potential? Hey guys! So I investing in barkbox the other day and wanted to see how you guys feel about its potential since it’s such a low stock right now. Should I hold it? Should I buy more?? Kinda new to this.
2021-06-04 18:36:02,stocks,BARK looks cheap compared to CHWY with way better gross margins. Should be at least a double from here once analysts start covering the stock.
2021-06-04 16:43:52,stocks,"People here clearly haven’t read the investor presentation. This company is very undervalued, and those claiming they have no moat : I point you to their customer retention. ITS 95 PERCENT! That’s unreal for a subscription box service"
2021-06-04 13:49:29,stocks,"I personally think chewy is a better investment and has a higher potential. 

My family has multiple dogs, a reptile, aquatics, and horses so chewy is pretty awesome. They also have sections for small animals and of course cats. 

They do subscriptions just like barkbox for gift boxes but also food and have other subscribe and save options. My family is subscribed to buy Wellness canned dog food in bulk from chewy and it’s so convenient! I’ve bought a few shares and it’s done really well!"
2021-06-04 17:10:18,stocks,"There are 2 aspects to an equity - first is how it compares to its peers and second is its valuation. If you say Tesla is a good company - is it good at $800 or was it good at $200 pre-split? 

To answer Q1 above : Bark > Chewy when it comes to Customer retention, CAGR and profitability. What that means is if 100 users subscribe to Chewy and Bark, 80 might stay and continue with Bark whereas 70 might stay with Chewy. CAGR being higher than Chewy means it is going to grow faster, profitability higher means it actually earns more per $ of sale than Chewy. Note that CAGR and profitability stack on - so if the rates remain same - due to compounding Bark will have a much significant profitability jump than Chewy in future. Bark also develops its inhouse products - these are listed in upscale store chains in USA - for example: Target and Costco. The consumers here are upper middle class/ upper class Americans - the type who buy brand new Subaru Outbacks - live in suburbia and have money to splurge on dogs. These consumers are definitely the type of crowd you want. Costco - also has a very rigorous selection procedure - you cant buy cheap products in Costco - its usually good quality at good discount. So there is validation that Bark products arent bad. Individual experiences can be hit and miss and one should not invest based on these. (for example I dont do weed but just invested in WeedMaps lol)

On Q2 - Bark just went public through a SPAC. If you know - since March OTC and SPACs have gotten murdered - capital has flown out of these speculative growth stocks. Once trading at $50 some of the big names like STEM got hammered to $16. Just rotation out of growth. BARK is the 2nd major SPAC after SoFi that has de-SPACed and done well, Paysafe and ASTS de-SPACed and tanked. In SPACs - we are seeing companies that actually have revenue and growth being bought after going public and companies like ESG plays with zero revenue getting shorted to $6-7. On valuation - this is a bullish sign for BARK - do your own DD on valuation side. But as a Business - BARK is pretty legit, else big premium retailers like Target and Costco would not be dealing with them. If you are swing trading - I think BARK is not a good short term bet as stigma of being a SPAC is with it, long term it should be very solid. Good luck."
2021-06-04 12:59:25,stocks,Personally subscribed for a while and ended it after about a year. The quality of their products continued to decline and we were getting the same stuff. Potential there but they failed the product test for me
2021-06-04 13:37:06,stocks,"I haven't done a deep DD, but because it doesn't have a moat, I would not invest. Absolutely nothing stopping someone else from doing what they do."
2021-06-04 11:00:01,stocks,Would you use their service?
2021-06-04 13:42:11,stocks,"I know people who use it and enjoy it a bunch. Bark issued at 10 so I'm kind of waiting for it to drop under that before I go too crazy but I did pick up a small position in it just because I like the company and I know it might not. The recent graphs indicate a downward trend but they did also just complete the merger so theres extra stock moving around right now.  Valuation is going to be hard to determine in the short term. I also think their stock price will swing around with their subscription count, similar to these TV channel subs, so I think it gets rocky anytime earnings comes around. Good or bad.  

Goodluck with it, retail opinion seems pretty mixed, which is what I'd expect from their service. Theres going to be a huge chunk that just renew without thinking about it and the rest will be a high turnover rate of people who tried it, liked it at first, but moved on."
2021-06-04 11:45:35,stocks,"https://www.reddit.com/r/hot_stocks?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

If you subscribe to that newsletter you can probably access the last email which has a bit of a DD for you to read. 

Personally I think these subscription services are a waste of money but I guess if people are flush with cash perhaps they'll do well for a while."
2021-06-04 16:49:50,stocks,"That's funny, I work in a package shipping warehouse and we sometimes get bark box products"
2021-06-04 13:59:57,stocks,How can mods justify keeping a post like this up? It's a  ridiculous pump.
2021-06-04 16:24:03,stocks,"They trade at similar revenue multiples, but barkbox has higher margins and growth so I don't see how. Bark is adding Bark Eats as well."
2021-06-04 18:15:27,stocks,"How is chewy the better play? Barkbox has an incredibly loyal customer base and better growth and a better valuation. And they’re expanding into food and other pet offerings will follow soon thereafter. 

This is such a short sighted and anecdotal response without doing any actual DD. 

I’m bullish on Chewy also but Bark has much more growth potential"
2021-06-04 18:08:22,stocks,Chewy is definitely the better play
2021-06-04 18:16:27,stocks,Anecdotal. Look at their customer retention numbers in their investor presentation. They’re stellar
2021-06-04 11:00:51,stocks,I’m actually using it! Just don’t know if people like it as much as I do.
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,Thoughts on NKE? Bought some calls for it but I’m surprised by the price action and why it’s going down so much today. I would think it would go up once things are opening back up and money shifts to value stocks as we see an economic rebound. Is there something I’m missing here?

2021-06-04 10:53:09,stocks,"If you wanted to bet on companies benefiting from opening up the time to do it was 6 months ago. Nike is already up nearly 30% from this time last year (coincidentally it's also up about 30% from it's pre-pandemic high). It makes sense that investors are taking profits. Remember, the market is *forward looking* you have to act well before whatever event you think a stock will benefit from.

If you're jumping in now (or recently) hoping to benefit from reopening, you've missed the boat."

2021-06-04 11:36:35,stocks,That’s a fair point. I’m trying to get better at timing my purchases and sells. How far should I look forward when making an investment usually? Is hedging for inflation already priced in? Should I start to make investment purchases looking beyond that?

2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"What happened with corsair? Corsair just dumped more than 6% at market open. I did my DD some im not worried, just bought a few more even. But i was wondering if I missed some news because it doesnt seem to be market related. Any thoughts?"
2021-06-04 12:31:11,stocks,The dump happened just after market close yesterday. Possible that an insider unloaded.
2021-06-04 10:33:23,stocks,I just added to my position
2021-06-04 10:46:00,stocks,"It goes back and forth for months now. From low thirties rising and the moment it touches 35, it crashes back down.. 35 seems to be the sell target price for a lot of people"
2021-06-04 13:37:27,stocks,"CFO sold some of his stack of warrant options, but not that much. its hit 3 mil volume today and there is talk of a large hedge fund and insider sellers profiting whenever it hits 35. but it might be due to lock-up expiring back a few months, and people believing 35 is a good point to sell for a good company. so it might be a good swing trade in that range for a while.

I believe this company is undervalued. Just have to wait till we get proof that it isn’t a COVID stock, and up we go"
2021-06-04 14:38:33,stocks,It probably just hit the top of a support area where either a lot of people or a big player bought and ended up bagholding and they've decided to break even with a large sell order rather than let the stock run.

2021-06-04 09:46:44,stocks,"I was just wondering myself. Haven’t seen anything, was tempting to pick some up. It dumped a bit in AH it seems on low volume so no buying pressure but not seeing any “reason” behind it."
2021-06-04 11:23:26,stocks,Its because there hasn't been the daily pump in r/stocks yet.
2021-06-04 12:07:19,stocks,Random walks. It's incredibly common

2021-06-04 14:24:01,stocks,"CRSR has been dumping at 34ish to 31ish and staying in that range.

I sold my calls Wed EODand bought puts Thursday morning due to that pattern.

Stop-loss triggered at down 10% (I was working), then of course it cratered AH and I missed it :/

I will rebuy at \~31 to ride it back up to 34 again (hopefully wont miss the next 34-31 run)"
2021-06-04 11:45:33,stocks,There are companies in the gaming realm that are significantly more undervalued than Corsair in my honest opinion. Enthusiast Gaming (EGLX) is a good example. Huya and Douyu are also immensely undervalued because of all the negative hype on China at the moment. I honestly believe they're both gonna be huge.
2021-06-04 15:07:03,stocks,"disclosure: CRSR bagholder. Well I'm basically at break even so the bags aren't very heavy.

But It's an overhyped reddit meme stock. ""bUt gaMiNg wiLl groW"" ok then how come all the people pumping corsair never talk about Razer, Logitech, etc? Because it's probably paid pumpers who are pumping it whereas Razer and LOGI aren't paying for pumpers.

Might dump half my position and put it into LOGI. At least that stock is *actually growing*"
2021-06-04 12:57:47,stocks,"No real moat, bad investment imo. Add to that, that a bulk of peripheral sales occur simultaneously with new pc purchases. Very few new pc’s being purchased rn bc of gpu situation."

2021-06-04 13:04:06,stocks,"Same. 522 shares, I'll buy more if it drops"
2021-06-04 16:44:08,stocks,  this is the news we missed
2021-06-04 14:50:34,stocks,"It's one of the few meme stocks that actually has decent fundamentals. They're profitable, growing and in a great industry."
2021-06-04 11:19:38,stocks,"This may be the answer. I checked the graph and it was pumped a lot two days ago. People complain a 6% drop, but it is just the same price three days ago"
2021-06-04 11:26:54,stocks," It sure why this is being downvoted. I keep an eye on this stock and it does have a correlation with other “meme-ish” stocks. While I personally don’t think it’s a “meme” stock, Corsair is known to be highly favoured in the Reddit community. 

It’s pretty fairly valued at the $31 level. If everything goes according to my projections, my FV estimate at YE is $32 at fairly conservative estimates. The only thing I don’t like about Corsair is their debt levels, but they’ve been reducing debt as they’ve increased their cash flows which is something I also like."
2021-06-04 13:41:12,stocks,"its in my puter, I specifcally went for Corsair, this is not just meme stock. more likely it is seeing the after effects of lock-up expiry on a company that has good value. people will dump into profit points. 35 seems to be it, at the moment."
2021-06-04 12:01:20,stocks,"It's not even pumped by meme investors. It's another wsb pump and dump job (meme investors have abandoned that place ever since it turned into jim cramer).

2021-06-04 19:58:03,stocks,"Yup unfortunately 😕
The company is solid though"
2021-06-04 11:59:47,stocks,"Was there any reason for it to be up? If there's no reason for it to be up, that's the reason it's down."
2021-06-04 09:49:44,stocks,Yeahh seems like thats the case. Maybe eagletree is selling again. Its also only back to where it was around 2 days ago but its just odd to see it pump 10% to immediately fall back to where it was a day later
2021-06-04 12:04:36,stocks,Not even....it's literally been bouncing around that price point for months. The last run up was anticipating earnings which immediately saw a profit taking dump after.
2021-06-04 16:31:16,stocks,You can buy in at $32 and still not worry about the stock going up and down short-term.
2021-06-04 12:28:07,stocks,Volume is really high today (over 2x 10 day average) so you might be right.

China is a bit fubar given US want a war with them"
2021-06-04 16:30:23,stocks,"The comparison to Corsair and Logitech is useless basically. They have like what, three products that compete against? Mouse, keyboards and headsets, that's it"
2021-06-04 16:03:00,stocks,"I'm not sure about it being a meme stock; being favored by the community because of the industry and its popularity doesn't mean being a meme stock like GME or AMC. As far as I know Corsair actually has good financials and has shown a sustained growth over time, despite their debt levels. Personally I think it's a good long term choice."
2021-06-04 13:13:45,stocks,"Do you have data to back up that “bulk of peripheral sales with new pcs”

That hasn't been my experience. When I (and my friends) bought pcs back in the day, we would put all the money into the PC and buy cheap $10 peripherals. Then once we had we had money we would buy nicer peripherals because they are the easiest upgrades. High end peripherals are also the main things I buy as gifts for PC gamer family members. They have the right price range and they it makes way more sense than buying PC fans or CPU coolers.

Anecdotal, but I feel like high end peripherals might be more detached from new PC sales than the market expects. I'm sure that's not as true for Logitech because they have very low and very high end peripherals and focus more on business customers"
2021-06-04 15:43:25,stocks,Actually their high margin revenue (peripherals) is growing at a faster pace.

2021-06-04 13:19:22,stocks,"*a bulk. I don’t really have any specific data to back this up, but it seems extremely obvious. People almost never buy a new pc without also purchasing peripherals. Sure they may upgrade peripherals at some point before pc replacement, but you still lose sales when people aren’t buying pc’s. I’d imagine the sales lose is substantial. And this is anecdotal, but I don’t think it’s very common for most people to buy higher end peripherals more than once or twice a decade per category. A $200 keyboard or headset outlasts most hardware for me and I’ve been at it for a while. But all of this is only a short term impediment. My real issue here is lack of competitive advantage in an increasingly saturated space"

I hope and believe GME will have a bright future, but I also think CRSR is in a good spot and the company's steady growth is a good indicator.
Just giving my two cents."

3) Not spectacular growth. This is just my perception but people talk about Corsair like it's some crazy growth sock yet their growth forecasts are just ok.

It looks like they took a hit last year with stores being closed, but that could be a speed bump. Also, a 3% dividend yield right now may or may not be sustainable as they restructure.

Payrolls increased by 559,000 last month after a revised 278,000 gain in April, according to a Labor Department report Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a 675,000 rise. The jobless rate dropped to 5.8%, while the labor participation rate was little changed.

Long-term Treasury yields are little changed, the dollar declined and U.S. stock futures moved higher.

The payrolls gain leaves the U.S. labor market 7.6 million jobs short of pre-pandemic levels. A broader improvement in the labor market requires faster job growth among service providers, like the leisure and hospitality industry, that have suffered a more lengthy disruption from the health crisis.

I've been telling my younger brother now is a great time to look for work, he tells me he doesn't need more money because he still has plenty from all the stimulus to cover what he wants, so he'd rather just enjoy the free time to not have to work than make more money he doesn't need.

If your balance isn't more than the cash you have in the account, there's no interest or anything. Margin can only rlly become a problem when you try to increase your total buying power with it. 

For example, I have 5k and 3k in margin, instead of just using the 3k to trade when my 5k is settling, I try to trade with 8k, and buy doing this theoretically I could lose more than all the money I have right? 5k. . So my broker will liquidate my position before it gets under 3k so they can repay the margin. U rrly don't wanna trade with more $$ than cash you have in your account. 

I do use margin though just for what you're experiencing right now. Good luck!"

""Shares of Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZGQ, -2.51% tumbled 9.9% in premarket trading, after the bankrupt car rental company said it received a revised proposal for its Chapter 11 exit from affiliates of Knighthead Capital Management LLC, Certares Opportunities LLC and Apollo Capital Management LP. The revised proposal includes funding of Hertz's reorganization through a direct common stock investment of $2.9 billion, direct preferred stock investments of $1.5 billion and a rights offering to raise $1.36 billion. The proposal also includes payment in full of all funded debt, and provides current holders of common stock with 50 cents a share in cash and either 10-year warrants to a total of 10% of the reorganized company or the possibility to subscribe for common stock in the rights offering. ""Hertz's Board of Directors has not yet made any determination regarding the revised proposal and will evaluate it in accordance with the procedures established by the Bankruptcy Court,"" the company said in a statement. The stock has rocketed 151.6% year to date through Monday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.36% has gained 11.6%.""

What I am looking for is to add some money every month into my portfolio and let it rest for a few years. After I get some decent profits and a big portfolio, I want to sell most of them and turn into dividend stock portfolio, and spend some of the money into something big like a house (down payment) or so. I am 20yo, about to graduate. My current holdings are;

\- AMZ

\-GOOGL

\- SBX

\- AAPL

\- UAL (bought this due to COVID, I know it will raise back again and I will sell it of before the other ones)

Others would also mention RDFN, Z, ROKU, SQ, SOFI, TDOC and a lot of smaller green energy stocks like PLUG, SOL, etc. I can give you some more tickers if you want.

And how much growth there will be for a company with market cap above 1T. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you wont find real growth on crowded bandwagon with everybody else. Might as well invest in QQQ instead of picking mega caps yourself. If you want real growth you need to find Googles and Facebooks of tomorrow but then of course you have maximum risk of getting burned and holding heavy bags with nothing in them. I don't know man, it's hard. If it was as easy as buying tech mega caps and buying a house few years later nobody would be renting. I don't think anyone here (especially here) will help you much with beating the market. You just gotta get your hands dirty, do your own research, make some mistakes and see if this is for you.

2021-06-04 17:14:57,stocks,"There is no ceiling on market cap. If business is good, valuation will keep going up. Simple as that. It wasnt that long ago when people thought $1T was insane.

Now if you think business will slow for Google or whoever then thats fine. But QQQ has inherent risk too. By going index, you have to absorb the failures and bad performers along with the winners and also deal with boom + bust cycles.

For instance, if you bought QQQ during the .com, you didnt break even till about 15 years later... a simple stock like KO actually outperformed by a huge margin, during that 15 year period and that assumes you didnt reinvest the divs...

Are you certain we arent in a sort of tech bubble now? Especially with the speculative stuff which has permeated funds like QQQ? Kind of feels like a speculative bubble to me and I dont think its anywhere near corrected.

Many of these new companies, especially eV related, will likely fail and many of the app based copycats and psuedo-tech companies who claim they are tech but really arent, will probably fail too. Further, I have a feeling that all this revenue growth we see in tech is not going to materialize into good margins (like old tech) due to competition. And then you still have some old legacy stuff in QQQ like old energy which I think we all know, will fail in time. etc etc."

If adblockers catch on (even more), Google will face a huge problem. They've been working with Chrome to try to mitigate this risk, but Chrome/Firefox/Brave/Safari/Whatever--they're all quite interchangeable. I think even my mum could switch.

So 300KB and 2 minutes is enough to undo Google's  business with respect to you, and every other person who uses them.

Add to that the possibility (indeed, certainty) of regulation in large parts of the world, and the difficulties of growing large companies, and I think you should see that there is a fair change that Google's shares will go sideways, slightly up, or even down.

And then add to \*that\* the fact that they already have 60% (off the top of my head) of the ad market, and you have to ask how they would grow. They can't double unless more people start advertising. Is that really likely? I guess they could hike their rates, but see above: regulation. They're monopolists. Behaving like a monopoly will hasten calls to break them up.

And ads are what, 90% of Google's business?

There will always be demand for big screen movies - it's an outing, an event.  A comparable is sporting events - you can actually watch them at home on tv and be able to follow the game much better, but that's not why you go to see it live.  It's a social outing/experience that you can't get at home.

2021-06-04 12:46:55,stocks,"Lol. If the stock goes up, we make money right?"
2021-06-04 13:06:45,stocks,The economic justice crusader slant is so cringy. I was on that train during the first GME fiasco and I because of that I left money on the table. Never again.
2021-06-04 12:55:05,stocks,"That's cool, making money makes sense.  I was always told that pigs get fat but hogs get slaughtered.  Everyone has a different threshold for how much profit they want to make.  If I make 20% on a speculative stock, I feel pretty good about that."
2021-06-04 12:50:13,stocks,"True, but a gain (or a loss) is not realized until shares are sold.  If an Ape bought at 35 and it goes up to 70, and then back down to 25, what did the Ape accomplish?  Isn't timing important?"
2021-06-04 17:11:50,stocks,"So you actually weren't on that ""train"" at all, is what you're saying."
2021-06-04 12:57:19,stocks,"Obviously there's going to be people who sell along way. But this is a viable strategy nonetheless. Look how may millionaires were made this week.  But more importantly, what happens when it comes out that these HF were actually naked shorting with shares that don't exist as many people suspect? And what if by holding on to shares no matter what, helped lead to that outcome? That would be a good thing right?"
2021-06-04 13:05:32,stocks,"If people were able to make money on this, then, yes,  that would be a good thing.  But what about the person who came late to the game and bought at $65?  And they bought those shares from someone who got in at $30 and decided to sell at $65.  Someone won and someone lost, and neither were naked shorts.  So this would be good for one and bad for the other.  And then there is the day short who yesterday shorted at $67 and covered at $47.  Is that good or is that bad?"
2021-06-04 13:26:27,stocks,I think that's fine. I just don't like how rigged the game is. Surely you don't think people should be able to trade synthetic shares do you? Thats all I'm saying. I understand where they're coming from. And I do make my money. I made 20k on bb options yesterday. Still support amc holders
2021-06-04 13:36:40,stocks,"Remember Enron and the hedge fund run by Doc Chanos?  Doc saw thru Enron's bullshit and started shorting it.  A lot of people paid attention and were able to get out before the stock finally crashed.  Chanos did not cause Enron's problems.  He tried to do the same thing to TSLA, but got burned because he could not outmatch the Teslaite's appetite.  What I'm saying is shorts serve a purpose.  They can be like dogs barking in the night at a thief.  Ultimately, the underlying value of a company will be realized in its stock price which hinges on the company's ability to generate a return for its shareholders.  Think about the fact that AMC just sold 11.55 million shares at $50.85.  What does that tell you?  The poor guy who bought at $65 got screwed.  And the true longs that were in at $3 back in January made a fortune.  It's an old game in which all is fair except lying."
2021-06-04 13:42:50,stocks,Nah he didn't get screwed. 11 million shares isn't shit. 600 million shares were traded yesterday. And that guy that bought in at $65 is holding bc he knows its going higher. And I agree that shorts serve a purpose. But they shouldn't be able to short more shares than are available. That's the issue here
2021-06-04 13:49:01,stocks,"Yep, when the short interest exceeds 100% of shares available, then that is a serious problem.  Maybe the SEC will figure out a way to fix this.  As for the guy who bought at $65, hopefully he won't get screwed in the end assuming AMC somehow gets back above $65."
2021-06-04 13:56:36,stocks,"Exactly. But someone is always going to get ""screwed"". It's difficult to time the market and there's always going to be bagholders."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

2021-06-04 16:34:13,stocks,Very slowly climbing out of the massive hole I dug myself into in early May. My groundbreaking new strategy of doing absolutely nothing seems to be working out.
2021-06-04 11:33:16,stocks,Can't believe I'm about to breakeven on my NIO bag.. all the DCA and it's finally about there..
2021-06-04 11:09:52,stocks,"memes down, portfolio up.

2021-06-04 08:36:20,stocks,Jobs report missed for 2nd straight month. Inflation FUD might be cancelled no matter what the CPI data says next week. NASDAQ gonna go wild.
2021-06-04 16:09:43,stocks,"Up 2% to end the week is pleasant. Waiting on news to justify adding to positions isn't though.

Get my semi-annual taquito dividend next week too so there's that to look forward to."
2021-06-04 17:30:23,stocks,"I'm so tired of this ""I'm not selling"" ""hodl to the moon""  in meme stocks. 

Take some fucking profit. You're gonna risk your gains cause being up +300% just isnt enough for you? 

If selling at a profit makes me a paper hand then call me the biggest paper handed bitch in town. I can clearly see why so many people lose money in stocks"
2021-06-04 07:08:45,stocks,"Why don't all stocks trade in the pre-market? There are some stocks where I don't see activity in pre or post-market. Is it just possible that these stocks' investors aren't trading the stock after-hrs, does it have something to do with rules/guidelines around the stock, or does it have anything to do with the market they're listed on?"
2021-06-04 11:36:16,stocks,JOAN is up 16-17%
2021-06-04 07:36:27,stocks,Any news on crsr for beeing down 4%? Might buy more if this is just a regular dip

2021-06-04 12:07:48,stocks,CRSR 😔
2021-06-04 14:09:16,stocks,"Dang. Coulda considered buying a few dips yesterday but I am trying not to chase the market as it rises like I did in early May which led to me getting shredded. Gonna just sit on my current holds and continue to let things roll for the time being. Things still seem a bit too jittery but I'll take this. Got a solid cash position as well as having now streamlined down to the things I have the most overall confidence and by now have hammered it into my head to not go buying crap on a whim without a well thought out gameplan. 

Literally less than $10 away from breaking even after being perpetually down since Feb now."
2021-06-04 19:37:22,stocks,Can anyone enlighten me what’s so special about DOCU’s earning report? +20% is really huge

2021-06-04 13:40:25,stocks,What do y’all think about GE (General Electric)?
2021-06-04 17:14:31,stocks,"Ended the day just $8 short of my initial investment. 

Made a lot of mistake in May with that crappy earnings season but have learned a lot of lessons and I doubled down on consolidation to keep my portfolio far more condensed in terms of position count all while getting a cash position. 

Overall learning to not be as jumpy and just let things roll until an opportunity I am comfortable with arises. Jumping the gun or rushing into things without a gameplan or vision has been gotten me burned bad but after refining my portfolio to things I am like and/or actually did homework, I have just about broken even."
2021-06-04 08:13:49,stocks,"Damn, bought a $F $15.5c for $6 on Wednesday, sold it for $46 on Thursday (underlying was ~$15.90...) just checked the price and it’s at $16.50 pre-market...! Could’ve held it for way higher a return. Oh well, I’ll take my 500% return."
2021-06-04 09:17:49,stocks,"WTI crude oil futures are pushing for 70, im starting to believe the 100 dollar oil futures. Im about to make boat loads of money. And buy a gas guzzling second hand truck this summer 😂"

2021-06-04 13:25:17,stocks,"Of course as I hold AMC shares, the price stops going up. As I buy puts, while still holding those shares, the price stops going down, and is now moving sideways, not sure which I should cancel, albeit those puts will be expiring soon anyway, so maybe it will be time making the decision."
2021-06-04 16:15:11,stocks,$ATOS and $JOAN kept me in the green today.  Glad that I finish the week in green!
2021-06-04 18:04:23,stocks,"I was following some foreign exchange markets and I noticed that some foreign companies have stock prices that are always even priced, meaning they always are an even number that ends in 0. This is different from the NYSE because those prices are always exact pricing.

For example, if you look at VOW.DE (volkswagen) stock pricing here: https://www.google.com/finance/quote/VOW:FRA

Does anyone know why its like this? I am just curious since the NYSE has exact prices."
2021-06-04 13:51:13,stocks,So I bought some Apple on open this morning. You guys are welcome.
2021-06-04 08:38:12,stocks,Shitty jobs numbers means we make money today. What a strange world.

Guess who's a VRT customer? MSFT.  And that's just MSFT alone.....the 4th industrial revolution is going to require tons of new infrastructure like data centers for 5g, IoT, AI, cloud computing, and big data.  I am all in are VRT.

2021-06-04 13:19:05,stocks,"For ATOS (from Yahoo, credits to RuLaiFu)

This is becoming a game of mind and time by now, however, I’m a Believer/Man of Faith!

All our DD since 12/2020 can not be all wrong;

ATOS managed to have 3 direct offering within 3/4 months, which is unheard of;

ATOS halted a critical P2 of Endoxifen for Breast Cancer about a year earlier, which is also very exceptional;

ATOS asked for extra 325 Mil AS (vs existing 123 Mil) which showed how good they felt about P2 Data of Endoxifen, and this was also kind confirmed by the way Dr. Quay talked about ""having a nice P2 package to talk to big Pharm ..."" in the Presentation at the Investor Summit Conference on 05/18/2021;

All the smart money behind 06/21 and 07/16 calls and the 10 HFs (each invested $5 Mil for off PPS at $2.88 in late 03/2021) are controlled by some very smart and greedy pro in investment, I would not believe that they could be fooled by anyone!

On 05/19, all 6 ATOS employees exercised all their available options at $2.90, Dr Quay - 1.90 Mil SH, Kyle - 0.85 Mil SH, others - 50,000 SH;

The fact that Dr Quay brought back Dr Chen (10% owner of ATOS in 2009) recently as a Dir of ATOS is definitely a good sign too. They might even be married by now. A smart scientist like Dr Quay would never bring someone that important to him into a embarrassment in case P2 of Endoxifen is not good!

Also, since ATOS is not going to present the P2 Data at ASCO this year (06/04 - 06/08, the only reason could be under quiet period for a BO/Partnership), this led me to believe that the probability of a BO/Partnership is 95%+."

I disagree big time with this. Statistically, the average retail investor that just invest in VOO or VTI will make ~10% per year. But the average retail investor that tries to time the market will be losing money.


And it makes sense when you think about it. If all you do is invest in VTI, you ARE the market so you get the market's 10%.


But if you try to day trade, you are competing against bots and professionals, and they will definitely crush the average retail.

2021-06-04 09:49:06,stocks,The only problem here is that this time is different. We have bad jobs report not because people are struggling to get a job (which leads to attempts to stimulate the economy) but because people don't want to work because they get more money this way. Look at hourly earnings - expwcted 0.2% rise but we get 0.5% rise. And thaf after 0.7% rise just last month! It's a clear sign of inflation and only way to stop it is to decrease stimulus - the economy is overheating. Which is bad for stocks.

One if my companies right now has a 101% float because they have a refinancing coming up, which is complicated, but it's essentially a stock dilution by giving extra stock to only another company. So for all the regular shareholders it's a dilution. So the short float says 101% but once those extra shares get handed out it's not going to be anywhere near that bad.

Yesterday was people buying up crazy amounts of calls causing gamma squeeze.

Maybe that will continue...but its not a short squeeze, there aren't enough shares short for that, and depends entirely on new people continuing to plough money into AMC. Its a cycle that has to end eventually leaving a lot of bag-holders.

A sidenote. AMC's valuation at its peak yesterday (\~$73), roughly matches that of GME at its peak of $480. AMC has faaar more available shares and keeps making more."

And that is actually what we're seeing with places like McDonalds and Subway offering incentives.  This cost will just be passed on to the consumer. And this isn't even full blown UBI, just something that's kind of similar but with very similar behavioral incentives.

Who gives a fuck.  Can the person do the job or not?  As someone who literally hires people I couldn't care less but I'd rather take the smart person who applied critical thinking to use the system to their benefit."
2021-06-04 09:33:09,stocks,"Oh yeah it’s ATH right now, but a few years ago it was trading reliably at like $20+, then they did share offerings to pay down debt which diluted shares which is why they lost value over the past couple years. Pandemic hits, share price tanks down to $6 or whatever and floats there for months, more or less.

What I’m saying is for the people buying at, let’s say $10, they might look 3 years back and say, “oh it was trading at $25, even if I ignore the squeezes I can still make money on this.”

What they might not realize is how many new shares have been issued since then. If you bought AMC stock in late 2016 and held, this week was the first opportunity you’ve had to make money on it. 4.5 years of holding just to finally make money.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"is there a valuation or fraud issue on OGN Organon? So OGN Organon just spin off today and its trading something like 4-5% of MRK market cap based on stock outstanding calculated as  ($36\*253 mil OGN shares / ($36\*253 mil shares + $74\*2.53bil MRK shares)

 which is seriously undervalued considering they're going to grab $6.52 billion estimated 2021 sales even if those sales are going down 20% and etc based on their 2020 annual sales decline. But the main issue is OGN is issuing $9bil cash payment to MRK which is like a cash dividend and if you subtract 9 billion from the $36\*253 mil you end up with market cap of OGN at $340Mil ? is this math right? then OGN market cap should be worth about 0.15-0.2% of MRK market cap? which is seriously like fraud?  am i misunderstanding something on the math or their sec filings?"
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Technical analysis vs algo trading I have started to read Trading for a living by Alexander Elder. In the book he explains the reasoning behind the technical analysis is mass psychology. E.g. people think in round numbers, so 5, 10, 20 are valid numbers for resistance.

I didn't thought about it this way which seems to make sense beside of stocks on multiple exchanges in different currencies.

The book is little bit old and things might be different now. So how relevant is this justification with the rise of algotrading?

I'm outsider to the industry but it seems now that algo trading is quite common for institutional investors which are the major players in the market, I think. If my reasoning makes sense, why would algotrading care about those magic patterns?"
2021-06-04 03:51:07,stocks,"OP you must understand that there are different strategies to what you refer when saying algo trading. HFTs (high frequency traders) and LLTs (Low Latency Traders), and quantitative traders.

HFTs exploit patters and use financial modelling. They generate a couple of cents each trade, but done a lot of times... e.g. RenTech.

What you often read as quants, it is the modelling part that they refer to. A quant firm is not always a HFT firm. Meaning the volume/speed may not be a factor. But most HFTs use quant strategies.

LLTs use the speed of their network to find and exploit arbitrage opportunities, sometimes even front run orders. Their ally is the speed at which they operate.

While different, in a fair share of instances the same firm can use different strategies for different asset classes in different markets.

Now answering your question, if the hypothesis is confirmed that TA works for some assets, in some markets, they will use it as one of the signals. Most quant shops use different signals.  So for example Numerai has approx. 200. Hope this helps."
2021-06-04 01:56:27,stocks,"Algo trading is not technical, as in technical analysis. That is, technical analysis is for soothsayers, tea leaf readers, and horoscope believers. 

Algo trading is about executing commands faster than you can click and type. Micro seconds and all. Plug in min, max, buy, sell, if then, and or, else end."
2021-06-04 09:58:10,stocks,"most professional investors don't rely on TA as a major part of their strategy. the data simply isn't there to support TA as giving any advantage over time, it's all too open to interpretation like Astrology. Ken Fisher calls TA ""witch doctors"" in 100 Minds that Made the Market. In his book The Most Important Thing, Howard Marks gives a more gentle debunking of TA."
2021-06-04 04:59:03,stocks,"This exactly. Though you didn't expand too much on quantitative traders, so I'll expand on that and give some indications on a deeper meaning to algo trading.

Algorithmic trading is about having a fixed algorithm (process) that you trade by. This might be as simple as ""if the price goes down at least X%, but more X% shares."" if you are a buy and hold type (likely combined with a ""Buy $X of shares on a monthly basis""). It's pretty easy to do the Algo trading via spreadsheets (of course that means it can take time to enter/exit positions, but depending on what you need to do that doesn't matter much). Technical analysis may be part of Algorithmic trading, and often autotrading is as well, since if it's good enough to do purely by hand, automating it might be better unless it requires human judgement calls for exceptional situations. Generally speaking, an algorithmic trader has some thesis that it is using to exploit opportunities. For the simple long trader, it comes down to ""buying the dips"". Of course, buying shares regularally is also wise in that case as the price may be going up and averaging up is about as good as averaging down.

I use a spreadsheet to determine buy/sell amounts/prices in terms of ideals, but use algorithms I written to pull transaction history and options data (for the more advanced strategies, spreadsheet isn't ideal for options beyond basic cost basis tracking) to work out cost basis and such for what is my actual portfolio situation. I have setup auto-traders in the past, but I've found they are rather sensitive to massive changes in price for my strategy. Hence its' better to just issue some limit orders (spreadsheet generates them in such a way that I can just copy/paste them in) rather than having an autotrader to track the change in price. Though theoretically it would be better."
2021-06-04 09:18:56,stocks,"Don't listen to this guy, he clearly knows nothing about technical analysis.

Technical analysis is basically about using chart patterns and indicators to interpret investor psychology."
2021-06-04 03:51:41,stocks,"My question was not that clear I think. Yes, I agree with you about the TA. On the other hand the justification of TA by psychology makes sense if the most volume is moved by people until some point. But now the most volume is moved my algorithm (I think so) , so why should one care about TA or psychology? 

I think psychology makes still sense for short term if one considers sentiment. There are movements followed by news. But not for the stuff like resistance and support. I don't want start discussing about candle sticks..

Just for resistance there would be trades around those numbers. Since everybody would expect those movements. This would make those numbers irrelevant."

At that point, I understand the stock is up over 100% off the lows….however in the past 2-3 weeks it has fallen all the way down to 12.12!!! Now so people may say, wait the CEO is selling. The CEO owns close to 8% of the company and has been there since 2010. Naturally, if the stock has gone from 8 to 16, I would expect him and some others to sell some. Also, his sales total under 3 million of late, it isn’t alarming. Of course, we aren’t thrilled to see it, but at the same time with the way the stock finally been rewarded naturally they should take profits.

A big catalyst is an investor conference next week June 10th.

Top Lines Sales at the company have gone from  2018: 40 million 2019: 44 Million 2020: 51 Million 

And are on pace to an all time record 65+ million for 2021

Bottom Line Earnings from 2018: -.04 2019: .01 2020: .15  Most recent report they earned 40 cents!!! .40 on 27.5 Million sales!! Beating estimates of .13 cents on 21 million sales!

In my opinion, and that is my opinion, they will have amazing numbers until at least 4th quarter of 2021. Which means all the way thru 9/30…. At least…. If you want to say that this growth wont be sustainable beyond that, I could agree with you. At the ame time at the moment the market cap is 200 million. They are starting to make serious cash, even if the same growth isn’t expected it is safe to say the current contracts with facilities should remain in tact for at least a year till renewal? So even if they do not grow at all and make 50 cents or more per share, isn’t this a great stop? Sales did grow 164% over 1st quarter of 2020… which is understandable that this wont keep up.

At least, in the mean time I am bullish at least until $16-17

Its not a direct ""true"" DRIP. You will still receive the dividend payed as cash.

This will usually show up and post at the end of the trading day. The next trading day it will purchase the required shares for the reinvestment and you history sill show ""Reinvest Shares"".

A longer answer.... That is an uncommon ETF.

Stock exchanges still require the purchase of whole stock shares. What is usually happening is your broker, with many retail investing clients, is buying pools of whole shares from the stock exchange and they are splitting the partial shares themselves.

This is why you can't transfer partial shares of stock if you move your account to another brokerage. It is also why a brokerage might not let you sell a partial share, until you sell all of your shares. You don't actually have that partial in your name to sell on an exchange, rather your broker is holding a whole share and splitting it between multiple investors using that same brokerage. When an investor has enough fractions to be a whole share, then they will put a whole share in that investors name.

So there will always be some things a brokerage doesn't offer fractional shares for, whether it is for trading or via a DRIP. It is the broker handling that, not the exchange, so they can only handle what is affordable that enough of there are enough clients investing in the fractional shares of a stock, that it doesn't create added costs for the brokerage to offer the fractional shares.

Schwab only advertises access to the entire S&P 500 for fractional shares. I know their DRIP handles more and they do DRIP on all of their ETF products. I've seen 4,000+ stocks advertised for dividend reinvestment before, but this might be dated.

I use merrill Edge mostly, but I have a Schwab account I use for Schwab ETFs and funds. So I'm loosely aware of this in the trading platform, but haven't experienced it because I don't use their platform in this way."
2021-06-04 07:39:19,stocks,Thanks for answers!! It did indeed take a day or two to move over. Guess I’m just used to things happening immediately these days!
2021-06-04 08:21:33,stocks,"on Fidelity there's a place in your account settings for ""manage dividends"" and you can chose ""reinvest"" or ""deposit to cash account"". probably similar in Schwab, so look around your account details."
2021-06-04 14:26:17,stocks,"Since you didn't buy these through a DRIP plan and bought them through a brokerage account the dividends are first paid in cash as that is how they come from the company paying the dividend. They don't send shares, they send cash. Schwab's back office then has to go in and buy the total of whole and fractional shares equal to your dividend. Just takes a couple of days."
2021-06-04 19:35:12,stocks,"I set all dividends to only pay cash in my account. 

I then use that to diversify."
2021-06-03 22:05:34,stocks,"That’s what its set to, and it was set to that before the ex dividend date. Which is why I’m confused about the dividend coming in as cash"
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Thoughts on Merck on the dip? Hey all! I’ve been eying a few pharmaceutical stocks for the last few months, as I believe it’s undervalued as a whole. I’m not looking at Pfizer or Johnson and Johnson, as I think they’re overvalued and over the new year or two will stayed there trend downward or sideways. Morningstar FVE has Merck at 100, with it now dipping to 74 is it a buy? I know the dip is with the Organon spin-off, but is this a buy? I’ve also been eyeing Gilead, however, that’s a bit less undervalued than Merck might be right now, as well as a dividend coming up. Thoughts?"

2021-06-03 21:41:06,stocks,"Merck is not a buy-the-dip stock. It's better used for long-term diversification. If you believe Merck (its sector, industry, business model) provides an appropriate compliment to your portfolio and its makeup, daily or monthly trends are meaningless. You should buy it."
2021-06-03 21:46:42,stocks,"I think Merck has some issues.  For example, one of it's ""blockbuster"" drugs Keytruda (I think it's like ~40% of their revenues) has some major competition coming from BMY.  Januvia, it's #2 drug, has also been slowly declining in revenues and I think there's been some negative news about its efficacy over the last year or so.  It's #3 drug, Gardasil, got expanded approval from the FDA so that helps.  But when drug #1 and #2 are stagnating and their future pipeline looks a little underwhelming, well, the stock chart speaks for itself."

2021-06-04 18:03:30,stocks,I bought MRK because it's an affordable stock that makes pet product. It's hard to find any pet company at a good valuation and this was one. I don't trade the stock; it just sits theres and once and a while I get a surprise like shares of a spinoff (OGN).
2021-06-04 01:05:32,stocks,"Thanks for bringing my attention to this.  To me MRK is in an almost perfect position to enter a trade.  Here's why:

1. the forward earnings estimates are roughly 10% avg annual for two years.  Not stellar but solid.
2. It's trading almost 20% below the LT high
3. If you look at a 10yr log chart and draw an average trend and range, it's trading at the absolute bottom of that range.  By that I mean there is an upward trend (I measure it at \~10% CAGR) with a large variation around that trend, and it's at the bottom side of that variation.

If you believe in the long term trend, you get that - 10% - plus potentially the swing from the extreme low point of the variation to the extreme high point of the variation, which adds another 20% to your upside.

I add that I don't follow MRK and I'm not hip to the company news.  But in a way if the news is negative that's in your favor - that's what's depressing the price and giving you an opportunity.  There's no guarantee that they will overcome everything, but as a $200B company with a long history of success, there's a good chance they can right the ship if there's a problem.

EDIT: I have no shares in MRK."
2021-06-04 01:10:11,stocks,"After a quick look at GILD, I would avoid that.  The forward earnings/revenue projections are flat to negative the same looking back.  This is why the stock has been steadily making new lows for five years."
2021-06-03 23:38:16,stocks,"I look more at it like safe money. You’re more likely to go up at it’s current price point than down, ya know? And that’s not just speaking short term. At this price if it goes down further it’s just more of a bargain."
2021-06-04 08:58:48,stocks,Morningstar has the fair value at $92.
2021-06-04 16:47:58,stocks,On top of all that there's a 3.5% yield.  I bought the stock today.
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"AMD prediction for the next 5 years? Hello all, I, like many here are computer enthusiasts and can see that AMD is top producer for computer chips as well as GPUs (even thou NVIDIA) beats them in that area. With that being said, what is your prediction for the stock in the long term investment?"
2021-06-03 21:27:24,stocks,"Outstanding long term investment. Price predictions aren’t very useful but it will easily be over $150/share 5 years from now. This stock gives you exposure to semi’s, electric vehicles, autonomous driving, 5G, cloud, ai, space tech, everything. This is one of the few stocks that I would literally feel safe buying and holding the rest of my life. 50 years from now they will still be growing. I firmly believe that.

The only downside I see is competition from intel, but i’m not very worried about that. Intel and AMD will share this space. There won’t be a winner and a loser."
2021-06-03 23:20:06,stocks,"I know this isnt what you asked but you may be interested to know that AMD does not actually produce semiconductors, they design them and outsource production to TSM (Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing). NVIDIA, Intel, Apple and many other companies do the same thing, design and outsource to TSM, this is one of many reasons why TSM is my main longterm investment pick right now"
2021-06-03 22:01:42,stocks,It's going to go up and then down and then up again...
2021-06-03 23:31:25,stocks,Lots of sentiment out there that the stock should be trading closer to $100 but due to the Xilinx acquisition (due to close before EOY) that the price is being suppressed while some hedge funds make money with something called [arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp).
2021-06-04 12:26:13,stocks,"Personally I think the big questions are:

* How long will the chip shortage last? There have been recent reports that it may run into 2023.
* What will the effects of Intel producing their own silicon have their competitive ability?
* Will Apple make ARM a player? (I recall a report about X86 support being worked on for ARM.)
* When will they bring the goddamn top-tier G series chips to the consumer market?

Great company though, one of the few non-dividend stocks I'd like to own."
2021-06-03 21:38:00,stocks,"They have published revenue projections which make this year's stagnant share price perfectly predictable. Those same projections, along with the projections of XLNX, tell us that the next 3-5 years make AMD stock a perfectly respectable play. 

In the current chip shortage environment, I personally foresee minimal stock price impact, with the only potential for deviation being toward the side of higher price for higher demand and limited supply, similar to what we've seen with lumber over the last 6-8 months. 

Bottom line: AMD shareholders need to be in it for another few years, and they/we will be happy. 

(DISCLOSURE: I closed my AMD position within the last couple months for reasons specific to my personal strategy and portfolio makeup, but re-entry into AMD is absolutely on the front of my mind between now and the end of the year.)"
2021-06-04 07:20:36,stocks,I think AMD is a good choice. You also may want to look at MU. Similar price point and a solid company with good expected growth
2021-06-04 11:59:39,stocks,Semiconductors stocks are a confounding segment of the market to apply logic to.
2021-06-03 21:38:12,stocks,Thank you for your answer. I just see in them having the potential to even rival NVIDIA for the GPU market. Even now at Computex they showcased some amazing products that they will be releasing.
2021-06-04 03:55:22,stocks,"I opened AMD as a new position at $73, and have 40 shares currently.

&#x200B;

I really like the company for the reasons said. I don't exactly think it's ""cheap"", but in an expensive market and with competitors at least as expensive (NVidia notably, but also even Broadcom assumes a huge jump in earnings, whilst Intel assumes a rejuvenation following management shake-up) I'm perfectly happy with this this as my semi of choice for long term.

&#x200B;

I'm really impressed with their TTM, and I think the market hasn't kept speed with the jumps in their numbers. This is now a mature, highly profitable company, and I expect that to continue, and also expect it to win some market share in gaming, core and AI.

&#x200B;

I am looking to add more shares under $80, which to me represents about a 20% safety margin on where I think the share price will be in a years time. I am slightly less optimistic than blended analyst forecasts, who have it around $104, but happy with either number :)"
2021-06-04 05:03:41,stocks,"It is very easy, it happens that share price is disconnected with underlying business of the company.

Company could produce great results year after year, but share price are lagging, and opposite also right."
2021-06-04 03:36:38,stocks,"To add to the point about Intel, in the short run AMD is grabbing market share from them. In the long run both companies alongside Nvidia have such large moats and barriers to entry that they are basically only competing against themselves."
2021-06-04 04:11:50,stocks,"Nailed it. The winner of the chip battle is always TSMC, but, back to the topic, AMD (Ryzen and Radeon graphic) now is superior to Intel and Iris, but, in the technology industry, something could change very vast."
2021-06-03 23:20:58,stocks,Thank you! I will look into it
2021-06-04 12:38:16,stocks,Intel doesn't use TSM. They have fabs.
2021-06-04 04:37:39,stocks,"Appreciate the simple and clear analysis , im going all in"
2021-06-03 21:39:22,stocks,"My goal is to own stocks. (At least 500) in the long term goal. (5 years). 
Thank you for taking time to respond."
2021-06-04 13:28:27,stocks,"That's not entirely true. Intel fabs are still a little bit behind on process technology, so their upcoming desktop GPUs are going to be manufactured at TSMC. Their server GPU codenamed ""Ponte Vecchio"" has some chips on it that are made at TSMC as well."
2021-06-03 21:49:03,stocks,"With a 5-year timeline and minimal tolerance for dips more than about 10-15 percent, AMD at its current valuation gives you a very solid upside imo, and it should treat you perfectly well. 

There's a 100% chance that hindsight will reveal plays that could have been more profitable, but using what we know now to make a risk-reward assessment, I think AMD is on a solid path, and the XLNX acquisition finalizing at the end of this year only boosts that projection."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"What are you guys opinion on Tesla puts? Tesla’s 20sma is about to move under its 200sma and it just had the bad news about it company’s orders in China, and with enough momentum it could break through its big support at ~542 on the daily, anyone else really feeling bearish right now?"
2021-06-03 21:06:32,stocks,"If you're betting against TSLA with puts, do it with 2-yr expiry and do it because you believe its current market cap is unjustified based on fundamental financial and economic conditions in terms of real world sales and projected market share.

Otherwise, buying puts after a stock has gone from 900 to 570 sounds an awful lot like chasing gains after meme stocks go from 10 to 60."
2021-06-03 21:02:34,stocks,As much as I think Tesla is insanely overvalued… I wouldn’t do it.
2021-06-03 23:23:32,stocks,"On one hand, my TSLA bags are heavy right now.

On the other hand, I would love spending money to buy the dip."
2021-06-04 03:12:12,stocks,"I have been buying Tesla puts since January, basically at least once every 3-5 weeks, usually with a 2-3 month expiry. 

I got burned initially and doubled double down for a double burn. Then I made it all back when it fell under $600 for the first time a couple months ago. Then I got burned once more when it went went above $700 again. Then I bought more puts and now I'm currently up (a little over break even on the year currently).

If this sounds fun to you, go for it... if this sounds exhausting and like a crapshoot, then I would agree. 

In my view, it's extremely overvalued, or perhaps overbought is a better term. I say this because I think all the inflation FUD is probably true, and TSLA will be one of the biggest victims of inflation in the short term. If they continue to innovate and execute then I'm bullish over a 7-10 year time span though. Cathie's $3000 in 5 years seems like a bit too short of a time frame to me though."
2021-06-03 23:29:47,stocks,Tesla is overvalued but it's price doesn't care. I wouldn't take the risk on a stock that ignores fundamentals.
2021-06-04 02:27:31,stocks,"I read Chinese news media and social media almost everyday. 
I think TSLA’s worse time was in May when literally ALL news and social media in China were attacking it. It all started from a Shanghai car show, then a series of news about accidents and quality issue (brake failure and car lost control). In addition, some privacy and data safety concerns, such as state own organizations cannot use Tesla , and some locations banned Tesla from entering. 
If China is not planning on kicking Tesla out, then there must be another reason for this heavy blow on Tesla. They are giving Tesla some pressures before a deal is made, just like wining a few battles before negotiating a truce, or in Chinese slang “show you some color” (give you a warning).
Then at the end of May, Tesla announced that it will build a data center in China, and all user data will stay in China. 
Now that the goal is achieved, I think they will be easy on Tesla. And Tesla is still considered a luxury foreign car brand by most Chinese people."
2021-06-03 23:46:57,stocks,Wouldn’t bet against Elon at this point
2021-06-04 01:14:08,stocks,"It really isn’t overvalued the P/E ratio will be 60 next year at the rate it’s growing, technical analysis doesn’t mean shit."
2021-06-04 04:59:48,stocks,risky. I'd say avoid. they are better calls out there with potential. Tesla puts will likely give you ulcers.
2021-06-04 11:06:33,stocks,OP you should be SELLING puts not buying puts on Tesla.
2021-06-04 19:35:20,stocks,"im a simple man, i see Tesla below $600, i buy."
2021-06-03 21:13:13,stocks,"Burry bought puts for a reason. Might be he thinks it's overvalued at it's price, maybe he thinks institutions long on Tesla will get liquidated. Who knows, what I do know is he bought some puts."
2021-06-03 21:14:16,stocks,TSLA Overvalued? Nonsense. Many professional investors lost billions shorting this thing for years
2021-06-03 21:33:11,stocks,I think Tesla valuation is actually in good deal territory. Good entry point as far as I am concerned
2021-06-03 21:18:55,stocks,Michael Burry agrees with you…
2021-06-03 21:18:41,stocks,Made 300% on Tesla put today. There is money to be made. Next support is 560 I believe. If it falls below that we see 300.
2021-06-03 22:13:39,stocks,/r/options
2021-06-04 04:46:52,stocks,"Hi, first time?"
2021-06-04 04:54:29,stocks,"I already own a pretty big stack of tesla puts. 

Imo, Tesla is still hiiiighly overvalued for what it is, and yeah, feeling bearish about it. I think Tesla is a decent company with a good future, but it just needs to return to reality, lol. And reality is a few miles south of here still.

It's absolutely a risky call though, Tesla has had a tendency to ignore fundamentals."
2021-06-04 10:31:18,stocks,Bad idea.
2021-06-04 13:30:41,stocks,"So I haven't read a really good answer pertaining to current market conditions and what we're seeing with meme stocks. But if you compare the top mean stock shorters and their portfolios most of them are owning Tesla as The top position in their portfolio. Now should the event happen where the meme stocks continue to rise and these companies are forced to gain liquidate as the meme stocks rise you're going to see a continued drop in Tesla price. 

Now the timeline for this is really unknown but many are predicting within the next three months.

Again this is super speculative, it's unknown why Michael Burry shorted the stock to the tune of half a billion. But he also called Said there will never be another stock like GameStop or another squeeze of that potential in February on Twitter. So if you're a gambling man, maybe see what you can do."
2021-06-04 14:14:06,stocks,Opinion: The price of TSLA can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. I advise against this.
2021-06-04 16:55:07,stocks,"Sure if you like gambling, I do but I'm still not taking that bet"
2021-06-04 18:33:37,stocks,It’s never a good idea to bet against Papa Musk
2021-06-04 00:44:33,stocks,Outstanding reply. A moving average at isn’t going to do shit for predicting TSLAs price or direction. I like to keep one or two LEAPS puts as a hedge and am considering TSLA... just so expensive.
2021-06-04 02:46:47,stocks,"Agreed. Also called “leaps,” this is your best bet. Their valuation is insane, and trading at such high multiples. I’m also thinking of buying long dated puts but right now, all my money is tied into BB. Might take profit and move them over to Tesla puts…"
2021-06-04 17:22:06,stocks,Yeah missing the boat here
2021-06-03 23:57:22,stocks,Why not? do you think tesla won't drop?
2021-06-03 22:27:46,stocks,"Don’t kid yourself. Burry bought those way back in the year and has likely sold-to-close them out. 

TSLA is down today on some BS news. Just watch orders and deliveries in June before earnings. 

Disclaimer: I have SHORT PUTS on TSLA, and I am holding shares. Bullish. Make your own decision but you fucking know mine."
2021-06-03 21:48:13,stocks,"I believe he bought those puts when Tesla was above $800. He also might have closed his position by now.

That being said, on one hand, Tesla is valued as if the company owns Mars and nearby planets, so there's still a lot of room for its stock to go down... but on the other hand, Elon Musk can make it go up by 20% by end of day tomorrow with a single tweet. So if you still think it will keep going down, you might want to do it with long term puts."
2021-06-03 23:32:40,stocks,"Gates lost billions betting against TSLA, take that as you will"
2021-06-03 22:33:37,stocks,It is overvalued. By several hundred. Doesn’t mean you should short it - you’ll get burned. Bullish baby
2021-06-03 21:35:08,stocks,"I was looking at it purely from the technicals, but from a company evaluation I can see how it looks like a good entry point."
2021-06-03 21:24:44,stocks,Just looking at it from a technical stand point with moving averages and the bearish triangle on the daily I’m very convinced we could see a big fall to at least 413
2021-06-04 03:00:54,stocks,Can I please get some of that stuff you got? It must be really strong!
2021-06-04 01:03:01,stocks,But I read on market signals 101 it's a huge sign and my dorito chart makes a flag so I'm going all in options which expire tomorrow
2021-06-04 01:07:43,stocks,I think it should… but who the hell knows what Tesla will do. It has defied logical valuations and price movement for most of the last year.
2021-06-04 01:38:10,stocks,"If Tesla has a working version of FSD this year that can drive people to work and doesn't have major chip sourcing issues, it's value will double by the end of the year. Right now is a buying opportunity. 

Also, China sales are irrelevant based off that number. It's how many vehicles they produced and where they were shipped to that matters. Tesla can easily sell every car it produced, it's just whether they had line shutdowns from chip shortages. 

The last time that info was used against, they had record production numbers for the month. Tesla ships globally and is still expanding into new countries constantly."
2021-06-03 23:42:28,stocks,Was that chinese article today bullshit?
2021-06-03 23:58:50,stocks,Exactly
2021-06-03 23:04:57,stocks,It’s a $2500-3000 stock kiddo. I been investing in TSLA before you even knew what bullish meant :)
2021-06-04 03:03:44,stocks,"Tesla is one of the biggest growth companies. Reading it from a technical perspective doesn't really make sense. You have to see the bigger picture with this one. The valuation of today does look insane, but is that still true for 5, 10, 20,+ years ahead?"
2021-06-03 22:48:00,stocks,Then do it. Buy puts.
2021-06-03 22:25:18,stocks,Someone bought my new 590 put eod today for 2k. That is a pretty yolo if they bought more than one.
2021-06-04 01:14:55,stocks,so sell puts then :p
2021-06-04 07:50:13,stocks,"They will not have full FSD this year.

Nobody will.

It's years away, people thinking that tsla will magically pull a rabbit out of their hat and produce it this year are just drinking the musk cool aide."
2021-06-04 01:39:48,stocks,How many vehicles did they produce last month? If that info is not listed then yes.
2021-06-03 23:31:07,stocks,Holy cringe
2021-06-04 11:39:27,stocks,"I think they are still a ways away from robotaxis and need better hardware than what's available, but may be able to get it to the point where it can drive you to work with no major issues. Will see soon enough, but it's no easy problem to solve.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Stock psychology If you had some green investments and red investments, would you sell the red if the green offset the losses or would you just sit long until it became green? Also, would portfolio % influence your decision?"
2021-06-03 20:26:16,stocks,"Sometimes you should take losses (for example you bought the top of a bubble or if something fundamentally bad happened), but otherwise I hold my longs and average down if I feel comfortable putting more % of my money in that investment. You should have had a reason to buy and hold the stock, price action is not as important as you may think if your company is doing fine, price will move back up in the future."
2021-06-03 20:50:38,stocks,"Nothing wrong with taking losses. What's important is knowing why you bought and whether that reasoning still holds up. If your reasoning has to do with the color font your gains or losses comes in on a particular day, work on developing better reasoning. 

One of my largest holdings in a very risk-reward investing strategy sits at a little more than 10% in the red, but it's a long shot stock with no expectation of doing anything noteworthy before mid-next year. 

If I bought it hoping to be 10% in the green by now, I'd need to reassess why I thought that and decide if continuing to hold makes sense. But as it stands, nothing has changed so I add to my position when it's opportune to do so."
2021-06-03 22:40:32,stocks,I sell the green to buy more red
2021-06-03 20:11:35,stocks,"Buy low, sell high. If i always sold red, it would be me doing the buying high, selling low..."
2021-06-04 17:41:18,stocks,Sell red ones to offset tax and then buy back immediately if you are certain you are in a dip :)
2021-06-03 23:41:55,stocks,"This is the difference between ""investing"" and ""trading"",  when investing you always hold through the dips, possibly even increase your holdings on dips because  you plan on making your money a long time from now as opposed to trading where you expect to pull out of the position in a week or two at most and could hold for as little as a minute or two. Investors hold, traders cut and run"
2021-06-04 02:04:33,stocks,"I’m sitting on my red ones primarily because almost all of them are not far from green. If they keep trading sideways, then I’d consider replacing them or just selling them and getting my cash out"
2021-06-04 13:22:09,stocks,"Your positions are irrelevant to each other unless they're competing companies.

Sometimes your whole portfolio may be down, that might be okay. It's more about the quality of your investments and your conviction in your choices. If your conviction is wavering you need to ask yourself why. Is it because you didn't do enough research, has something fundamental changed, did the CEO sell 100K shares to buy another yacht? Red and green don't matter, *why* they're red and green, and why you bought them matter."
2021-06-04 19:38:13,stocks,"I have green and red every day.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"How rich is Zack Morris (FURU) This guy seems like he is filthy rich the way he casually just gambles millions of dollars each trade, yet it seems like he usually wins big. 

Does anyone know who this person actually is and how much money he has? He just posted a couple plays today on Twitter of $AHT and $BBIG with total about $5million invested.

That’s crazy to me lol.

Edit: I know who Zack Morris is (Saved by the bell character) but on Twitter there is a dude who acts as him and makes crazy trades and shows them. He also tries to pump stocks. I was wondering if anyone knew who he really was."
2021-06-03 20:47:40,stocks,"Ya I see multiple of his tweets all the time flexing his wins. But again there are so many out there that post winning trades all the time. Don't know who is legit or isn't. However, I would like to know though."
2021-06-03 21:26:43,stocks,"Seems like a pumper to me but if you are into investing and look on Twitter, Its hard to miss that guy. Also seen bunch of his repost on reddit. So i am also curious about who he is really.

I didn't buy it back then but the lesson learned should be to not chase a trade idea when it's long gone ... just because there's a price target above current cost, doesn't mean it's still a good buy at that price."

2021-06-03 20:06:11,stocks,Slater will always be second fiddle…..sorry but it’s true
2021-06-03 21:21:18,stocks,"Oh 100%. You are correct. 

I am holding it forever because it is the best lesson ever.  It is a minuscule amount that I wanted to gamble with and luckily for me it tanked right after I bought it. So lesson learned. It is about 1bps of my total investment but it will always remind me not to be an idiot. 

I guess I should be thankful to Zack Morris for this cheap lesson. But I also think he is a total fraud. So here is that."
2021-06-04 09:19:09,stocks,"True, although he was extremely bullish on FUBO even at $60.  His price target was $100 EOY for the stock."

May the lesson bring you the tastiest of future tendies."
2021-06-03 20:13:33,stocks,I know. I’ve seen the show but there is a Twitter profile acting as Zack Morris and he makes some crazy trades and makes $1 million profits off one gamble.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"To long investors who have attended a shareholders meeting, how are they supposed to go? A certain retailer that I’m invested in has recently confirmed the date of its annual share holders meeting and Q1 earnings report, an interesting thing to point out is that in this release it states that the meeting will take place from 11:00am EST to 11:15am EST... a whooping 15 minutes. My question is how odd is this? And what is traditionally discussed during these meetings?"
2021-06-03 22:37:12,stocks,"Do you mean the “share holder” meeting or the actual share holder meeting. There is basically two meetings. The first if for everyone. Make you feel good about owning the stock, how it’s gonna continue up blah, blah, blah. The second one, which you didn’t go to since you are on Reddit and asking is for all the insiders to figure out how to fleece all the other share holders and the general public and ensure they get maximum profit at the cost of the company, the workers, the common share holders and the public."
2021-06-03 22:41:48,stocks,What’s up with the downvotes? It’s a genuine stock question and I didn’t even say the ticker
2021-06-03 22:44:15,stocks,"Now is this you being pessimistic or actual what happens in practice? I don’t see how appeasing all shareholders, big and small, would not be beneficial for a company and its growth."
2021-06-04 01:42:02,stocks,I’ll upvote you because I don't get why you're being downvoted
2021-06-04 13:25:15,stocks,bad bot
2021-06-04 07:01:38,stocks,"A little Pessimism and sarcasm. But in all reality general share holders don’t really have a lot of influence on anything compared to those that have large quantities of shares. It’s not one person one vote, it’s one share on vote. So little guys don’t have much pull."
2021-06-04 03:11:52,stocks,Yeah because small investors aren't really worth the time to do much talking with. It's the bigger players that get the attention but the meetings are good to get a baseline for the next quarter and financials update. Personally would just rather read the transcript or see if an audio file of the meeting exists.
2021-06-03 20:20:23,stocks,15 minutes gave it away 😂 that and I slipped on a 🍌 on the way in
2021-06-04 07:43:50,stocks,"Makes sense, I was more so just trying to figure out if a meeting as short as 15 minutes is common."
2021-06-04 14:38:07,stocks,"It could be if there isn’t much to put out such as the company will hit expectations, there isn’t much of a difference between expectations and actual data and the company is not making any major changes."
2021-06-04 14:43:02,stocks,"Ok that makes sense considering the general consensus on Reddit’s surrounding the stock in question is that the numbers will look good,so no point in dragging things out when they don’t need to be. Thanks for the reply!"
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Why should I get exposure to the utilities sector Hi, a newbie investor here.

Im thinking in investing in the utility sector but Im not sure what are the pros an cons of getting some exposure in that area. 

Can someone help me please, any comment is well received."
2021-06-04 01:33:03,stocks,Good dividends and a safe bet for when stuff crashes
2021-06-03 21:04:11,stocks,I have had VPU on my watchlist forever and it is so so volatile. I thought it would be a boomer safe stock. It isn’t.
2021-06-03 21:12:36,stocks,"Edit: The reason to buy them is that they're safe (defensive) and they pay a dividend. They will stabilize a portfolio that has more speculative names in it. If you want to live off your stock portfolio it's also nicer to get reliable dividends than to have to take whatever the current market price is each month.

\---

I like Verizon (VZ) and Vistra (VST).

Verizon is just a solid company and I think they have some potential upside beyond the dividend payout from being able to offer 5G home internet, competing with cable monopolies.

Vistra is on the riskier side as far as utilities go, but it's still pretty safe overall. They have a lot of operations in Texas and they got screwed in the Winter Storm Uri disaster due to a complex situation that resulted in them having to pay insanely high natural gas prices. That caused them to lose around $2 billion and tank the stock price. I think they're quite a good deal now as they have good underlying growth and profitability, and I don't expect those events to re-occur."
2021-06-04 00:32:11,stocks,"I like $PCG becuase it's a risky play with massive upside, and you can hedge your downside cheap with options atm."
2021-06-04 08:20:18,stocks,"pros: utilities tend to pay large dividends; they're steady and stable; they have little or no competition, often a type of regulated monopoly; they can be overlooked and undervalued. in his books, Peter Lynch talks about the pros of utilities. 

cons: they're steady and stable so not fast-growers; they can have lots of debt; they can face ESG/green pressures."
2021-06-04 11:37:07,stocks,"OP check out NEE, green energy utility company and a solid dividend"
2021-06-04 19:41:31,stocks,"Pros: They are steady, consistent, pay solid dividends, have fairly consistent demands, long-term contracts, legalized monopolies, they don't go up/down like a meme. 

Cons: Same as pros. 

For the 5-50 year timeframe, most will be very solid performers. No 10x there though."
2021-06-03 23:32:58,stocks,How about invest in $VTI and never ask about the exposure of each sector again?
2021-06-03 20:38:50,stocks,"yeah, thats my main interest, since some known investors are predicting a crash due to inflation (burry, ray dalio, charlie munger). I want to move my portfolio towards REIT and Im studying buying some utilities"
2021-06-03 22:04:55,stocks,"It seems like every asset class is overvalued right now, and I believe utilities are no exception. 1 thi g you should look at is the history dividend payout for whatever utilities you are looking at. You'll probably see a low dividend yield right now. So why haven't utilities upped their dividends much? Either they don't have the cash to do so, or they themselves think their stock is a bit overvalued. What happens if it tanks 33%? Their dividend yield will go up 33%, which may be at an unsustainable level.  
Last year one of my most profitable company was a utility. I made my money by shorting it.  
When utilities have a high yield, their share price is low and I buy their stock. When the yield is low, I short the stock.  
Proceed with caution."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Explain expense ratio to me 
If this sounds dumb, excuse me.

Let’s say I invest in an ETF that is selling for $100 per share and has an expense ratio of 1%.  I buy one share for $100 dollars.

7 years later, the ETF is worth $200 per share and I sell.

Where did the expense ratio get taken out?"
2021-06-03 20:54:58,stocks,"You can think of the expense ratio as 'weighing down' how well the ETF tracks the underlying stocks it's holding. The way it's implemented conceptually is that the amount of the underlying companies' stocks the ETF share is worth will go down by 1% per year.

For ETFs, the market doesn't exactly dictate the price, because it's actively managed by the company that offers the ETF in order to minimize tracking error. If the ETF becomes more valuable than the companies it holds, they will package up more company shares and sell the ETF shares to bring the prices in line. If the ETF is less valuable, they'll buy it back, crack it open, and sell the underlying shares which will again put the prices in alignment. (In reality they may do this operation in a more sophisticated way but the effect is the same)."
2021-06-03 22:21:01,stocks,"For a real world example, compare the S&P 500 index (SPX) against the S&P 500 ETF (SPY).

You will notice that SPY is not exactly 1/10 if SPX, it is bit lower, even though the ETF is meant, by definition, to be exactly 1/10.

This is because SPX is just and index and has no expenses, but SPY is an ETF has to buy and sell underlyings and hence with expenses and other management expenses. 

Hence over years, SPY has slowly dragged behind 1/10 SPX value. So you don't pay for expenses directly, but it slowly causes a drag in comparison to the benchmark."
2021-06-04 09:25:02,stocks,"an ER is an annual fee, so it's 1% per year. but they often take out 1/12 of 1% per month, or 1/4 of 1% per quarter, something like that. this data might be shown in your account history so poke around in the settings. 

plus with ETFs you pay the difference between the bid/ask spread when you buy/sell. bid is buyer's prices, ask is seller's price. there's always a gap, and the lower trading volume the larger the spread will be. you pay at the ask price, but it goes into your account at the bid price. the difference is paid to the market maker as a commission for handling the trade."
2021-06-03 20:23:22,stocks,Just buy PRTS & HUIZ & ignore those ETF’s
2021-06-03 21:22:03,stocks,"One of the beauties of ToS (and quite possibly many other finance apps) is the ability to compare any two securities to each other.

In [this image](https://imgur.com/rWvy5BL) (taken from a screen shot on my ThinkOrSwim app two minutes ago) the S&P 500 is displayed as a flat line, and the performance of VOO (S&P index fund) in relation to the S&P is shown in the green line. 

At the right, you see that the green and red lines are very close, meaning that the performance of the two over the past year has been very close. However, along the way, you see very sudden quarterly drops in the green line. Those drops are where the value of the fund decreases in response to the maintenance fees being taken out. 

That's where it happens."
2021-06-03 20:15:40,stocks,Hmmm... ok but doesn’t the market dictate the price?  Like in my example isn’t someone else buying the ETF for 200 a share on the market?
2021-06-03 21:21:04,stocks,"You answered my second question before I asked it.

Thanks for helping me wrap my head around this idea."
2021-06-03 20:51:16,stocks,"Absolutely, the price of each unit is set by the market. The funds returns, however, will be lower because the company running the fund takes their profit from the value of the ETF before you see it."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Does buying/selling options affect the price of the underlying stock? Does buying/selling options (without exercising them) affect the price of the underlying stock? From a bit of googling, the answer seems to be ""in theory, no, but in practice -- sometimes"".

So then why the following strategy isn't widely used?

Find lightly traded stock with solid fundamentals. Buy slightly OTM calls with short expiration (should be cheap). The price shouldn't move much, correct? Then start buying the actual stock. The price will move up with the momentum. Sell calls for large profit. Immediately buy slightly OTM puts with short expiration (should be cheap). The price shouldn't move at all, as selling calls should be balanced out by buying puts? Start selling the actual stock. The price will move lower. Once done selling stock, sell puts for large profit.

Or did they simply make this illegal with some regulation?"
2021-06-03 20:27:54,stocks,Pretty sure this is a form of pump & dump. Which is not legal unless u work at Goldman
2021-06-03 23:45:32,stocks,"From my understanding it’s solely based on share supply and demand. With that being said, when people see high amounts of open interest on options, it entices them to purchase options and shares, if bullish, or selling puts etc. for every call I purchase OTM I make sure I buy shares to go with it. I sell both if I see it’s trending in the wrong direction on short term OTM calls. 

So no, I don’t think buying options directly affects the price, but I think it plays a huge part in how the stock reacts based on speculations, aside from fundamentals and news."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Debating whether to buy first share of AMZN or more VTI 
I’d like to gain more Amazon exposure but I have to buy full shares in my ISA. If I were to buy a share, my cash position would be down to <5%. Other than AMZN, I’d also like to get some shares of GOOG, DIS, MSFT when they come down to the right price. AMZN looks like the Best Buy to me right now but it’ll take me a couple months to gather some cash again so I guess what ik asking is; is it worth pulling the trigger now? Nothing but earnings beats but trading flat for 10 months with a historically low PE.

Other than these I still plan on adding a total market index fund so technically I have exposure but just not as much. Do you guys think Amazon is a buy right now? If a stock split is announced, I think the price will easily shoot up another 10%."
2021-06-03 21:59:46,stocks,"When you're talking that much market cap across so many companies, you're better off going w/ index funds IMO. 

AMZN, GOOG, DIS, and MSFT combine to form 14% of the S&P 500. Further, if they're all moving upward, there's almost 100% chance most of the rest of the S&P is doing the same.  

However, particularly in the case of AMZN and GOOG, there's regulatory and political headwinds that could disproportionately impact those companies, and owning the index funds as a whole mitigates that risk. 

If you're looking to beat the market, do a bunch of research about valuations and top-down sector and industry assessments. Put 50-70 percent of your money into index funds and put the rest into the 2 or 7 longer-shot, off-the-radar plays that you expect to beat the market by a lot. Overweighting into AMZN or AAPL isn't going to be the answer."
2021-06-03 21:30:23,stocks,BABA
2021-06-03 22:27:17,stocks,"I'm actually slightly torn on Googl. Part of me thinks that the huge cash flows they're generating now are from the platforms they developed a long time ago, and now those cash flows are peaking. Because it's just ads where this money comes from, there's not really a product they're selling. Whereas microsoft and Amazon are selling products and the ad revenue is just on the side. And LinkedIn is likely going to be the biggest social media site in a few years, bing is taking market share from Google etc. Google is an example that cash flows aren't everything, and you would need to look at the future story of the company. 

I still like Google, and these are just musings, but I think it's riskier than those two."
2021-06-04 01:33:42,stocks,Why do you think Google stock will decline. They seem to be executing and doing very well
2021-06-03 23:37:00,stocks,">If a stock split is announced, I think the price will easily shoot up another 10%.

You're 500% better off with VTI with logic like this in a stock market. It's not even worth a debate because you're just speculating and chasing gains."
2021-06-04 01:29:33,stocks,"Bro, LinkedIn will never be the #1 social media site and Google is not losing market share to bing."
2021-06-03 21:59:53,stocks,MSFT is expensive rn.

2021-06-03 23:11:49,stocks,Why is the AMAZON PE a screaming buy? It's skyhigh.
2021-06-04 05:54:57,stocks,Personally I’m expecting VTI to outperform QQQ for at least a year. Tech has to take a break from its insane 2020 growth
2021-06-03 22:44:55,stocks,Because it’s on the other side of the gme in terms of hedge fund shares owned
2021-06-04 12:02:50,stocks, of course thats because they haven't even been around for a year
2021-06-04 06:35:55,stocks,"It's actually the lowest it has been in years, by quite a lot."
2021-06-04 07:35:09,stocks,You know ... I need to go back and look actually.  I was under the impression that it's revenue vs market cap was relatively attractive.
2021-06-04 12:03:08,stocks,Nice cherry pick
2021-06-04 09:36:20,stocks,Still does not make it a good buy. Bringing 1000 PE down to 100 is not enough. People assume that all of this market share that AMAZON has carved for itself will translate into profit and that's a big assumption. Some companies have never translated market cap into profit (See Uber).
2021-06-04 10:02:34,stocks,"Amazon has always been good at making profits, they just spend almost all of it on growing the business. Amazon is a money printing machine compared to Uber, which is definitely not worth it's current valuation (in my opinion)."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,Do stock valuations even matter anymore? It seems like stocks act however they want regardless of what ever the hell the P/E ratio or CAPM model says. To what extent does valuation even matter anymore? Am I just wasting my time doing comparable comps analysis on my Excel sheet?
2021-06-03 21:27:42,stocks,"Companies today that are fundamentally sound and positioned to be substantially bigger in 2 or 5 or 10 years will see appropriate stock movement over the applicable time frame. 

If you think your dying industry stock is undervalued because reasons, and you think you should see a cartoonish spike because millions of retail investors simultaneously decide they agree with you, odds are that you'll be disappointed.

2021-06-04 02:12:38,stocks,"In the past year they have not mattered as much, across the board.  Of course, this doesnt apply to everything, just my overall observations.

What took place over the past year, was a lot of investment into high growth stocks where the stock prices increased to quite high multiples.  The market became way way over leveraged with lots of hedge funds and people buying margin.

During this same time, You saw a lot of value companies go under the radar, or were being constantly shorted to suppress the price because there was not enough volume too push the pricing up because all the money was over with the growth stocks.

Now, People are coming back to the fundamental value plays (i.e. oil, which despite increasing significantly since the beginning of the year, is still quite undervalued based on trading multiples). The accumulation has been massive for many of this retail, cannabis, ev stocks. Whose prices fell by 50 to 75%. 

Companies have to slowly unwind there speculation plays in order to buy into the fundamental place, So the transition should take a couple months before we see things start to level out everywhere."

2021-06-03 22:15:49,stocks,"This, and let me illustrate why.


Let's say you buy MSFT, and unfortunately, investors decide to sell and it goes down 20%. As long as the earnings and growth stay as good as expected, you don't truly have to worry. Why? Because of dividends. Regardless of what happens with the stock price, if the earnings are good, MSFT can keep on increasing dividends year after years. At some point the dividends just get too good to pass up, and the stock just HAS to go up.



At the opposite, no matter how crazy popular a stock gets, if the earnings never match that popularity, it is bound to crash at some point, because investors don't like to hold a stock that produce no money. If the only expected gains are from more and more people buying an useless stock, its essentially a pyramid scheme and we know how these ends."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Recovery periods for movements post earnings releases Hi everyone,

I was looking at stock movements after earnings release and I wanted to get a sense of how long it takes for the stock to recover after a movement the next day. I had a very simple strategy where I would buy a stock sometime before the date of earnings (to be calibrated also) and either sell it if it rises or hold on until it recovers (if it ever does). I looked at historic movements to spot stocks with highest potential to do +/-5% move, and filter to keep those with minimum recovery periods. Recovery is basically when the stock price meets the price before the earnings release.

I compiled all this into this dashboard where you can look at these numbers by symbol here: [earnings-watcher.tech](https://earnings-watcher.tech/)

Here are some symbols with lowest/highest recovery periods:

**$MMI, $AMPH, $EVH, $SNPS**: around *1 day*

**$NEOG, $MAGS:** around *40 days*

**$ENG, $KODKL**: around *100 days*

Happy to hear your thoughts and discuss the code if interested. Enjoy!"
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"The ""new"" market is exhausting. The GameStop drama got me to Reddit. It made me rethink the investing strategies I had for years. I started following too many subs. Too many opinions were circulating in my brain at all hours. The potential to make 20% returns tomorrow left me in a manic high. FOMO was eating me alive. I eventually dropped individual stocks and sat on index funds and ETFs. Shut it down for a couple of weeks. Felt freeing. Then the meme storm happened this week and all the noise in my head came back again. In summary: ""Everyone is making tons of money except you.""

Trying to keep up with the next ""Short Squeeze"" or the recovery flavor of the week is truly exhausting. Which again, is why I fell back to index funds. 

I never thought I'd be wishing for a chance to just get a CD with 3% yield again to get through all this post covid volatility."

I will say for a while there, with the insane amount of green I was seeing during some of the meme stock craze, it was consuming me. I would sit and watch my phone or computer and be absent from my home life, more or less. Thankfully I’ve learned to tone it down, after my wife brought it up, while still maintaining a good idea of what’s going on in the markets that at least interest me. I’ll never know exactly what’s going to be the next GME, and I’m cool with that. I make good daily returns and that’s all I can ask for. On the days that have me excited, I don’t get as much done at work but like I said, I’m in a position where I don’t need to be doing something all the time or even every day haha.

1930-1932: down 83% over 2.1 years  
1929: down 44% over 67 days

When a bunch of people run up a stock, sometimes you win sometimes you lose, but someone will be holding the bag when it's over. Since these companies are over valued they don't make it through the bear, and if you've never experienced a bear market, it is not easy to explain, but the air gets sucked out of you and look at how long they last. 

Average retail investor get 1.9% return, which mean half do worse. 

Times like these give a false sense of security, and after the pandemic we might still have a good run, but it will end. 

When you buy poor companies you are really speculating, and that is fine, but like casinos big risk big reward.

I have a play money account that has grown 5 fold from being lucky and really in the market since the crash of march 2020. Not a genius just lucky to be in the biggest market growth we have seen in a long time. Anyone should have been able to make gains being in the market the last 16 months.

I tried following meme stocks with options, and had some good winners but most ended up on the losing side for about a wash overall. 

Since then I've been buying meme stocks and instead just holding them. I cash out the initial investment when they go on a run and then figure when to get out later. But I do this for fun. This is no longer stressful for me. 

I had to walk away in January after the craziness with GME. I made a lot but on paper missed out on some serious gains and it was consuming my waking hours, pre-market, during market, and aftermarket, reading post trying to see what the next play was. 

Following DFV was fun, but glad he ended it when he did. It felt great being part of that history and landing on the right side of it. 

But now, I wrote simple tracker in python, that watches the tickers I'm interested in and emails me any new interesting moves. So it watches it for me and I can peek in when something interesting happens. 

The other thing to keep your sanity is to plan your entry and exit. Figure out a ticker you want and price you are willing to pay and put in a GTC+ext limit order. When that hits, put in a sell GTC+ext limit order at the price you want to sell it at. Then it is automatic. If the price is hit, pre/post or during market you don't miss out. If it doesn't hit after a while cancel and readjust or pick a different meme ticker.

While I’m staying away from the GME/AMC craze at the moment, it’d be hypocritical of me to hate on it since I did the same thing in 2018. One thing I’ll say though is that some of the comments about this being a “once in a lifetime opportunity” is laughable. There will be some new meme stocks in 2022."

With  brokerages and apps forcing people to sell or making it to where you cant buy certain stocks because the hedge funds weren't prepared for the stock squeeze and now they want their money back. All of my penny stocks were heavily shorted right after the game stop squeeze.  The market is a fucking illusion at this point it's all artificial feeling now.

It sounds like this is all self-inflicted.

2021-06-04 03:49:43,stocks,"Hi, I am a newbie here, but a couple things:

1. I have been reading and it seems that it is normal to have to change your trading approach every few years as the market changes. Specifically how you trade options, penny stocks, etc. Maybe value investing never changes, but if you are chasing high returns rapid, you are trying to capitalize on volatility. These are usually rapid plays, so your system is super important, FOMO only works if you watch a lot, AND if you get in early enough. The real question is why risk your money using a strategy (FOMO) that you aren't trained for- if you want to FOMO, train to be good at that strategy. For example, I am trying to learn how to fomo pumps, I check stock screeners, screen by volume, look for 130-200% Volume for 1-10day versus 365 day trading volume (average), and screen by ""biggest gains"" and ""biggest losers"". Question though, using AM-C as an example, this stock took off, when it hit 25 USD you had to ask, is it over, should i FOMO? If you FOMO'd you'd ride it to 50, then 70 right? The problem is, you are in uncharted territory- how the heck will you decide when to exit???? FOMOing inherently is really hard to ""maximize profits"". If you don't want to miss out on the 20-50% gains, develop a FOMO approach, pick stocks you think will breakout, or better yet read the meme stock lists and develop a strategy for each one. Then you have a system and the impulsiveness goes away...
2. In the case of the G-ME, there has been months of information, DD, and discussion. The message appears to be buy and hold. In that example, you would just buy and walk away, no FOMO needed."
2021-06-04 04:56:04,stocks,I totally feel you. I've had to switch notifications off and stop my news cycle because I basically make less rational decisions when bombarded. Stick with your instincts. If you are that worried try to sell only enough to feel like you've made your money back +20%. That has kept me holding remainders for far longer and has worked well for my mental well-being too.

2021-06-04 05:22:42,stocks,"It's only exhausting if you're overweighted in memes and trying to keep up. 

Buy a small stake if you have FOMO. Roll your profits into your favorite ETF.  If it doesn't print you money, at least you didn't invest much.


The market outside of memestocks is pretty normal to me. My favorite finviz screener still churns out winners and i haven't changed the filters in several years"
2021-06-04 05:39:11,stocks,"Dude i feel you, I often have the exact same feeling the volatility and the FOMO is absolutely mind boggling and can make you go crazy.  
  
I had to take breaks just to keep my self sane..  
  
But on the other hand i have to admit, that this whole process of ""FOMO Trading"" made me learn quite a lot on the actual financial markets at play, the rules and the lack of rules in this whole system and i keep learning every single day..  
  
So yeah perhaps all this drama can make one go a little kuku, but in the same time it has a potential to drastically speed up your financial literacy...and this has immense value anywhere in time you throw a rock at.  
  
My suggestion would be to stay cautious, DYOR DYOR DYOR, invest only what you can afford to loose (in the ""drama schemes"") , strategize and always learn as much as you can.  
  
You will get your time with CD's and ETF, but no reason why not use some of your ""vegas money"" for 'education purposes' and for a chance to be part of a bigger movement and have a potential to make some crazy gains in a crazy market.

If I continue doing well I will steadily up the ETF % and theta farm % while reducing high-risk YOLO's (I consider almost any naked call a YOLO for the purposes of portfolio).   


I do try to diversify my theta farm for downturns but it is difficult with low capital. Some of my holdings may not have options available yet (even though they are in the theta farm tranche, like HMPT I guess they are not in the right place lol)"

What do all these meme stocks have in common? They are all perceived to be under valued. 

Stop chasing the news.  Stop worrying about what others are doing. Find stocks that mean something to you. 

I haven’t stepped into a GameStop in ten years. Every game I’ve bought has been downloaded through my Xbox.  So, I don’t own the stock.  

Steven Spielberg said a few years back that the movie theater experience is dying. It’s only a matter of time before it’s $100.00 a movie and only few people will experience it. People now have giant TVs. Surround sound.  Higher quality food than anything at a movie theater. Streaming services that they already pay for.  I haven’t been to AMC in years.  I don’t own the stock.

I think both of these are long term losers.  I don’t worry about the day to day gains/losses.

So it's sort of like being angry at someone for winning the lottery - there were longshot odds and they won the bet. There's no guarantee I would have got the same result trying to do the same thing

After the initial surge in Jan, we did see a steady trickle of heavy loss porn from meme-stock winners who got on the bad side of a longshot bet. If people are taking these risky bets, it will probably catch up with them eventually, as is the nature of YOLO bets. 

That said, a lot of conservative investors probably do need to be a bit more ambitious. Buying bad investments (negative real return bonds) because of perceived safety and low volatility is just as dumb as meme stock yoloing IMO. Maybe its even more dumb"

If you just own shares in stuff you should've worry too much about watching things on the daily if you trust what you buy and do your DD on it.

2021-06-03 20:19:32,stocks,"I think 2020 introduced a generation to the stock market. There was this weird dynamic where people had fewer things to spend their money on, stimulus money was flowing into pockets of people who never actually lost their job or suffered any particular financial hardship from covid (like me), and the stock market had tanked briefly but then began to experience a highly publicized meteoric rise. I got into investing in April 2020, and like most people who didn't yolo on meme stocks I've been riding the easy money train to triple digit return percentages, all thanks to this crazy recovery. You simply couldn't avoid making money if you didn't have money in the market before the crash and bought anything halfway sensible on the way back up. I made roughly 277% on my portfolio in the last year.

It kinda reminds me of the Gold Rush, with people pouring everything they had into a dream of easy wealth.

But none of these people, myself included, have ever had the reality check of a major correction or the long stagnation of a kangaroo market. We've experienced nothing but the *apparently infinite* monthly 10% gains. Of course, that can only be sustained as long as people continue to pour money in. What happens when an entire generation of new investors becomes overextended and the rocket runs out of fuel?

Seriously, go zoom out SPY by 30 years and look at this fucking momentum upwards. It's not sustainable.

I don't think it'll be a crash, honestly. There isn't an obvious catalyst for a sudden crash that I could point to. Instead I think it'll be a stall-out near the ATH's which transitions into a long-term bleed-down as senseless euphoria gives way to uncertainty and then maybe to despair. Faith in the infinite money machine begins to wane, coupled with things like rising interest rates. Basically: reality ensues.

I don't know what to do. I know you shouldn't time the market, but everywhere I look I see insanely overvalued securities flush with new investor money. I'm holding 80% cash right now, just closing out long-term holdings as they mature and dabbling in options to stay entertained and ahead of inflation until I can figure out what the fuck is going on."

Irony?

Look, let’s examine some simple numbers, according to Yahoo finance.

AMC has a float of 448 million shares.
Short interest is 21%, roughly 94 millions shares.
Volume was 580 millions just yesterday, with the stock losing 17%, which suggests there are plenty of sellers.

Even if all shorts were to cover, it probably would’t cause much of a price move compared to what we have already seen. There doesn’t seem to be lack of shares to cover.

What is moving the price is the pumping from buyers, not the covering from shorts. And pumps are inevitably followed by dumps."

2021-06-03 20:28:47,stocks,"Well that’s the whole thing, right? If you saw the catalyst, the crash would have happened already."
2021-06-04 02:11:14,stocks,"I'm okay if SPY does a correction. but, then I have a decent amount of time on my side to average down. I've closed a lot of my positions in the last year with the exception of 3. One of them being a SPY. The other being two dumb stock picks that I want out of that i didn't do enough research into.  


If the market turns into a bear market. It's just a way for me to DCA into SPY because at that point in time, my horizon from now is 15 years. If it bears for the next 5 years, I'm okay with that. But you're right, the momentum of SPY this last year has been short of insane and if it does correct, there's absolutely no way to say ""Yeah, didn't see that coming""."
2021-06-04 06:43:17,stocks,Yeah i know haha. Stayed away from anything considered remotely risky since. Not worth the effort to me
2021-06-04 01:31:48,stocks,"The next time the market will go down, I wonder if we will feel the same way."
2021-06-03 21:03:46,stocks,Gensler was even at the GME hearing. There’s so much going on.
2021-06-03 20:54:29,stocks,"The ""MEME stocks"" are a whole different animal.  You can apply the traditional TA to them, and do tons of DD, but in the end they will not play like normal stocks.  Different rules apply here.  HF's are playing out every edge they can find to hide the numbers and bounce the value at will (at a high cost).  I have come to consider them high risk entertainment.  I am not a day trader, but Im sure they are having a blast this year.

I have other off the radar stocks that seem to react the way I expect them to.  Low volatility, low rewards, but they are climbing."
2021-06-03 20:45:31,stocks,"We are all selling a share at 25mil a piece. And we will buy the stock a second time when it goes back to regular levels, causing us to squeeze each other again. You really think people are going to move on? That would be stupid. So I believe it’s a long term play no matter which way you look at it. The company is amazing and I like the direction they are going in especially with their new performance center and no company debt. And on top of that they are creating a versatile NFT"
2021-06-04 12:47:49,stocks,I see people trading $50 on RH thinking they are hot shit making $1 XD but I mean I guess one becomes elitist when thousands are on the line.
2021-06-04 01:45:29,stocks,"cash is a bearish position. it's a position where you admit ignorance of how high and stupid the market will be, and just sit on your hands till things start making sense again. the only thing is requires is patience, which is why almost no one can do it. I once sat in cash for 5 years. Then made 70% all at once. The best thing about it is that if you only buy in crashes you don't really spend many days of your life looking at how red your portfolio looks."
2021-06-04 18:22:39,stocks,"Because it has no chance to recover in my opinion. It was a 500 initial position. I can use the money better in more thought out positions. I've made it up in the meantime. Also after a few months it has only gone down further. It has nothing to do with risk. Holding bags until the heat death of the universe is not my idea of investing anymore. I'm more conservative now, and more consistently profitable. (It wasn't gme btw)"
2021-06-03 20:35:39,stocks,I'm just not built that way 😂
2021-06-03 20:38:58,stocks,"I bought AMC at $2.90 in January thinking it would rebound nicely after the pandemic. Maybe $15-$20 or so. It bounced to $19 and I held because it was a meme stock. 

Then I sold it this week in increasing increments as it went up. I still have ten shares, but I made a tidy profit getting rid of the rest."
2021-06-03 23:58:28,stocks,"Yes, remove emotion, sadly most people can’t"
2021-06-04 17:24:49,stocks,"""Set alert based off of hypothesis..."" etc

Is the best way I've found. I have a model for how I select investment instruments with a series of rules based off of a combination of how I value things (both in hard numbers like EBIT and in less tangible things like ""can I envision a path that this company's current management would grow it?) and my personal risk tolerance and I stick hard to that unless something truly miraculous is at play. I form a hypothesis based off these and do not sell until they hypothesis is false or I am forced to reevaluate it. I modify my model as I find flaws. So far it's worked well for me - I'm no Buffett but I've managed to stay ahead of the market overall and beating my retirement account's lazy money with my play money makes me a happy boy.

The only time I break away from this is in truly exceptional cases. Reading about Dr. Burry's letters to Gamestop and the subsequent DD made me buy in back in November at $10 and goddamn has it been a ride. Can't say I'd have ever seen that play otherwise, so there is definitely something to be said to crowd sourced DD. Just gotta be careful what you read because there is still a lot of useless noise out there."
2021-06-04 16:04:28,stocks,"Yeah, I have a handful of shares, spread out that I am going to start setting alerts for when prices go up to a certain level.  


IF those alerts go off and things look like they are running away? I'll set stop loss sell points where I will have a VERY decent return."
2021-06-03 22:09:40,stocks,The market will only crash after you fomo back in lol
2021-06-03 21:16:40,stocks,"It already came when tons of growth stocks dropped 60-80% the past few months lol how much lower do you want them to go? This is just the recovery now, most are still nowhere even close to where they were before the enormous Feb-May correction."
2021-06-03 21:15:30,stocks,But........
2021-06-03 20:03:41,stocks,"Completely understandable. I’m sorry to bother you once more but I’ve been with GME and amc since January and I’ve seen nothing but green and I have spent every day for the last 6 months doing my dd on these two and I’m waiting for a squeeze. If the squeeze already squoze. Why tf are we back at almost 300? But then again, this is my investment decision. Gotta follow where the money is going"
2021-06-04 00:24:54,stocks,Just remember the market humbles all.
2021-06-04 02:03:56,stocks,"Obviously, everyone in the world should double their wealth every week or months. Forever. This is how money works and is perfectly sustainable. And Reddit is the place to learn how to do it.

Given that, I’d buy stock in Lamborghini (Volkswagen), cause everyone of the 10 millions WSB subscribers is lined to buy one. Order yours now, before the waiting list get too long!"
2021-06-04 18:33:28,stocks,Meanwhile WKHS has a 42% short interest but the apes back at wsb are still focused on AMC
2021-06-04 01:04:47,stocks,Im not sure how true this is now. When the media started talking about gme it was at $40 or something. I decided to sell what I had at $60 because it was too mainstream kind of regretted not holding for a few days.
2021-06-04 00:38:01,stocks,"$YYY Entered 3,500 shares at $16.50 Jan 4 2019 ($57,750). 

Sold at $16.50 March 9, 2020. ($57,750)

+$6,930 on dividends. 

Rebought 4,583 shares at $12 on March 23, 2020. ($54,996)

Current share valuation $80,339.

Plus roughly $8,000+ in dividends. 

It aint much but it's honest let your money work for you typa stuff."
2021-06-04 07:51:58,stocks,"I set one up in January to put $20 in and see how I do.   Third for trading days.   Can only do every other day under $25k (PDT) so to do every day, a second account was needed."
2021-06-04 08:24:28,stocks,I frigging hate ICLN.   So tired of holding these bags.
2021-06-04 01:48:56,stocks,"I actually have a bit of ICLN too.

My big wakeup was GIK. Reddit (/r/SPACs) loved GIK. I read all the ""DD"" and decided to drop some money into it. Everyone promised it would pop after its merger.

Now ZEV is a joke and it sits red in my portfolio. But it taught me not to listen to Reddit so much."
2021-06-04 12:56:14,stocks,"This, exactly. ICLN was a huge pump in Reddit now it’s totally off the radar, like you said."
2021-06-03 20:14:20,stocks,Thanks for the advice :)
2021-06-04 12:19:20,stocks,Thank you!
2021-06-03 23:42:43,stocks,"You obviously have never looked at wsb, they literally gloat about their losses"
2021-06-03 21:01:38,stocks,"Most things I just bought at the right time, I’m in EUCAR since 0.29 because of WSB for example"
2021-06-04 09:58:01,stocks,You may want to actually find out what we are talking about before you comment
2021-06-04 07:00:58,stocks,"Exactly, GME went from $450 down to $40 really quick last time, you never know when the music will stop."
2021-06-03 22:32:18,stocks,"Not tips, more like keeping an eye on it."
2021-06-03 22:03:44,stocks,"I didn't say that, I said that big money is keeping an eye on it. That doesn't mean they are buying what WSB is flogging, or even shorting/selling it. I didn't insinuate anything, you did that yourself"
2021-06-03 22:34:42,stocks,"Oh there are lots of ""tips"" on WSB, just not many good ones lol"
2021-06-03 21:12:06,stocks,31st time is a charm!
2021-06-04 01:11:50,stocks,I thought vegas was already open.
2021-06-04 01:16:42,stocks,They think it will be the peoples stuck into a short positions that will need to buy thoses not other trader buying shares at 2000. Its actually did happen for GME back in jan some fractionnal shares got executed for absurds numbers (above 1k). But GME in january was a total anomaly. It won't happen but if its ever happened only a few pumpers would manage to sell at those insane valuation.
2021-06-04 13:22:21,stocks,"Yeah I guess I got lucky starting after the great recession. I know my uncle got hit hard by nortel as well. If you factor in peoples who lost big during the dot-com crashed and the great recession maybe the 1.9% figure make sense. The last decade, I feel like was easy mode the whole time. Also I am Canadians and the CAD was really strong the first few years when I started trading, which helped a lot."
2021-06-03 23:22:22,stocks,"so these are laws that affect an individual investor?  Or these are not laws that affect an individual, because that is what I was referring to.  

I thought I was on an investing sub, not a banking reg sub..."
2021-06-03 21:46:24,stocks,"Some DD definitely end up predicting the right movement. Of course, I am only talking about the T+35 T+21 theories which seem to have been right. But apart from thay you are right that these animals are unpredictable."
2021-06-03 21:41:40,stocks,"People in this sub probably get Hung up on all the crude terninology in the subreddit for these ""meme stocks"". This makes them disregard the absolutely God tier research some people write up and put out on those subreddits."
2021-06-03 21:22:31,stocks,"I don't believe that AMC will squeeze as hard as GME, not trying to convince you just ajswering your question"
2021-06-03 20:18:56,stocks,Yes because diamond hands is a meme for morons
2021-06-03 20:52:23,stocks,I think you are confusing the meme with the real strategy here. But I wish you luck regardless.
2021-06-04 10:31:51,stocks,"lmao stop saying ""we"" think for yourself. dont get left bagholding"
2021-06-04 01:49:10,stocks,"Did you buy in march 2020? I personally sold before the crash and switched to a bearish position to profit like crazy... then proceed to lose all my profits in two months. You still have to know when its the actual crash and not a dip or precrash. 

I honestly like this approach and was thinking about doing something similar but not sure I would have the self control or feel like buying when the sky is falling haha."
2021-06-04 00:38:33,stocks,"Nor am I :)

I created rail guards for my own sanity and to protect my logic based hypothesis. I still struggle with it but have learned to trust in my DD and lean into those rules I setup for myself. 

Absolutely cannot let emotions inform FUD. It breeds toxicity. When folks say trust the community, it's for this exact reason. 

Lmk if you want tips or tricks."
2021-06-03 22:08:43,stocks,"You guys live in a lucky age where you don't pay fees.
My trading accounts have minimum fund amounts, ND still cost 10$ per trade."
2021-06-03 21:18:48,stocks,"Well done.

I bought yesterday, had a 70% gain, didn’t sell till you know the drop today for a measly couple percent."
2021-06-04 14:28:06,stocks,TRAITOR
2021-06-04 00:33:44,stocks,C.R.E.A.M
2021-06-03 21:43:24,stocks,so youre saying now is the time to get into growth stocks even though we've cycled into value stocks?
2021-06-03 20:00:58,stocks,"most definitely bro, Idk if this is just my personal opinion but i feel like investing in itself has changed a lot in the last year. with a lot more people ""buying the rumor selling the news"" differentiating between pump and dumps and actual good long term plays has become a bit more difficult at least for me personally. A year ago it felt a lot easier to get winning trades."
2021-06-03 22:03:16,stocks,a lot of speculation on chamath carrying GME to the moon.
2021-06-04 09:34:17,stocks,"Don't regret it. You profited, that's a win. You have many years ahead of you, you don't need to cash out at the peak on every investment. 

I know you already know this, and I know you will probably still regret it a bit, but it might help hearing it from someone else. You made a good decision. 

I'm sitting on a bit of AMC, and will probably regret it when I don't sell and it plummets. That's a real regret."
2021-06-04 02:45:55,stocks,"> Everyone promised it would pop after its merger.

Yeah I specifically warned people about GIK quite a few times in /r/SPACs. The astroturfing was clear as day. Like literally the last thing you want to do is invest in a company every other reddit ""investor"" is putting money in. It WILL dump."
2021-06-03 21:08:12,stocks,"My advice would be to invest in a stock related either to something you like, or something you have decent knowledge of. Obviously you should look at fundamentals as well (difficult for a newbie but lots of videos cover it), but basically...

Are you a gamer? Take a look at Corsair, or perhaps Nvidia/AMD/Blizzard. Ignoring that fact that GME is crazy right now, a gamer could consider what they are doing and themselves if, as a customer, they would like this. A gamer will enjoy researching a gaming company way more than some weird tech company they barely understand."
2021-06-04 00:04:59,stocks,Let’s not even talk about wsb
2021-06-03 22:59:44,stocks,Just understand you are in the middle of a giant bull market. Things can be different
2021-06-03 21:03:27,stocks,Cool
2021-06-04 12:26:53,stocks,"ive read the book and i am interested in bubbles/crashes so i am quite informed, your comment about the bulb craze being similar to the current market offered no comparison but please clue me in on what you guys are talking about"
2021-06-03 23:12:57,stocks,thank you for your insight into what billion dollar hedgefunds do with wallstreetbets shitposts
2021-06-03 22:32:08,stocks,">Heck, hedge funds and investment banks are screening WSB every day now to see what the most mentioned stocks are. There's witch hunts on heavily shorted stocks. GME isn't an anomaly anymore, AMC nearly doubled in one day this week.

you said this. at least have the balls to stand by what you say"
2021-06-04 09:34:42,stocks,"I'm not sure if it's fully open in terms of no masks, distancing, etc. I think the floors are open, but sitting there with a mask isn't a great experience."
2021-06-04 01:50:41,stocks,"Exactly, there will no doubt be a few idiots who will buy some shares but not many"
2021-06-03 20:01:58,stocks,"I think you misunderstood how he was using the words ""made"" and ""lost."" Zero sum game means that nothing is created or destroyed, only transferred. Every winning trade represents an equal loss for other parties.

>In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which an advantage that is won by one of two sides is lost by the other. If the total gains of the participants are added up, and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero.

Margin is just borrowing money from your broker, which again is just a transfer of wealth, just with the promise that you'll pay it back. The creation of money is not something that occurs in the stock market. We only transfer it back and forth. For every winning trade, someone has an equal loss. Sort of a Newton's third law of the stock market..."
2021-06-04 14:46:26,stocks,"We will probably have a correction after the run up on things opening up.

it is the exact opposite where nothing is working and they are all losing, usually comes with layoffs and people are cashing out just to pay the mortgage."
2021-06-03 23:24:43,stocks,"individual investors aren’t the ones that created these massive short levels, naked shorts, synthetic share mess, etc

it’s the banks and hfs.. thats why THEY are being regulated - this will never happen again because the DTC wont put up w this shit anymore"
2021-06-03 20:26:38,stocks,Yeah but if you sold you did not listen to WSB.
2021-06-03 20:54:04,stocks,"I did my DD for the past 6 months. If I’m wrong I’m willing to accept it and so will the other millions of investors around the world who have reviewed this data and could not come up with a counter argument. Have a nice day bro, and may ur tendies be plenty"
2021-06-04 10:42:10,stocks,25 mil
2021-06-04 02:00:26,stocks,"Oddly enough, no. But that's another story.

Anyway there's nothing special about it. Just sell when CAPE is high (it's like 37 just now). Sell and leave the money in cash. Wait till the market drops 30-40% (it will eventually). Buy in. That's it. EZ PZ Lemon Squifficult."
2021-06-04 11:59:02,stocks,The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent!
2021-06-04 01:58:39,stocks,are you saying you're in the past
2021-06-04 11:00:13,stocks,"Boomer mentality: can't change my broker, can't cancel my landline"
2021-06-04 11:34:01,stocks,You know you can change that. Easily.
2021-06-04 08:58:43,stocks,Get out of the past. There are sooo many brokers that charge very very little or nothing
2021-06-04 14:22:51,stocks,So change how you trade then.
2021-06-03 22:25:16,stocks,Why do so many ppl still panic sell? Only time I’d ever sell something on a red line (and def not meme stocks) would be to free up cash to get a call option. Don’t sell when it drops. As old man buffet says “BTFDF”
2021-06-03 22:33:07,stocks,"I already made that mistake with GameStop, buying it all the way down. I didn't sell though. I'm still stubbornly waiting for it to hit $350 again."
2021-06-03 22:31:16,stocks,"Same. I understand the potential for greater profits and that holding (seems) very likely to pay off.  But, I've been doing what OP wrote about, and at 9 am this morning, after being up for over 24 hours with this and seeing the shitshow at the beginning of the day, I set a stop limit, and tried to sleep.  Woke up to see that my limit had been triggered, yet the stock was back up into the 60's.  Panic bought back in with what seems like an idiotic avg cost now due to all the volatility.  So far, I've profited, but I'm down now and feel both stupid and tired, so that's never a great combination when making decisions.  Oh and at some point, I thought snagging that $145 call for tomorrow was a good idea, too. At least the premium was only $295..."
2021-06-03 22:32:56,stocks,Why would you sell...? I bought more shares when it dipped to $43 today. Why would you not buy more shares when there is a discount? It's going to bounce right back up tomorrow and watch it hit $100 by Friday or next week and you will regret it.
2021-06-03 22:06:42,stocks,"That's the maddening thing about it. You just don't know. Both make sense. ""Growth is dead, it's value now. We've been hearing about the rotation for almost a year now.""  vs. ""Growth got killed and value is still bubbly.  If growth can hit X once, it can do it again. And it's 1/2 X now. You're very likely to double your money."" And that's how it's always been."
2021-06-04 01:02:53,stocks,The market is cyclical. If you're buying long term then just buy and stick with your convictions. Big money rotates sectors throughout the year. Just like value stocks were down when growth took off the opposite will happen again. Just have to do your research and invest in what you believe are good companies.
2021-06-04 11:25:35,stocks,"Now is the time to invest in any stocks you like. Yesterday was the best time but now is the second best. Look at the growth chart of any stock that has done well and has good fundamentals in the last 5 years.  Yes there are dips but most good stocks trend up significantly.  Find out what you like and put your money in. You're not going to kick yourself for missing out on a small dip, you're going to kick yourself for not jumping in at all"
2021-06-03 22:13:20,stocks,"Delete reddit, you will feel better when you stop listening to all the bullshit and do your own thing"
2021-06-03 20:16:47,stocks,You decided to pay a 600x multiple for a car company instead?! Your friend might be the smart ones in the group.
2021-06-03 22:06:04,stocks,"Maybe speculation, maybe not, nothing is for sure and both sides are equally valid depending on the information you have came across. But none the less I wish you the best and hope you have a goodnight! May the tendies be plenty"
2021-06-04 03:48:08,stocks,"I'm sure your comments were the ones I ignored because they were interrupting my confirmation bias.

Valuable lesson. Thankfully it wasn't too expensive."
2021-06-03 21:38:35,stocks,"this is the Peter Lynch style, a pretty good one, he wrote at least two excellent books"
2021-06-04 00:03:59,stocks,"It’s really important that fundamentals don’t get totally overlooked.  It a company you “like” has bad financials, then it doesn’t even matter if you like them.  So it’s really crucial not to miss that part.  Heart alone doesn’t make you money."
2021-06-04 08:13:49,stocks,"I know, 12% is bear etf at the moment 👍"
2021-06-04 12:33:13,stocks,"We are talking about the Dutch tulip bulb bubble on the mid 1600s, exactly which book is it you are saying you read? That is a genuine question, not sarcasm"
2021-06-03 22:37:52,stocks,"""chasing tips"" and ""screening"" aren't the same thing, at least not to me. To clarify what I said: they are interested in knowing what the most mentioned stocks are; what they do what that information is anyone's guess. In my books, ""chasing tips' implies acting on those tips, ie buying what WSB is buying. Is that what you meant? Because that is not the same as ""screening"" and just gathering data."
2021-06-03 22:02:44,stocks,"Is loser bucks the British pound, as in lb? If so that's amazing haha"
2021-06-03 20:28:56,stocks,"Exactly this. 

“Everyone” didn’t make money on these meme stocks. The reality is that those who did make money made much of it by leaving other Redditors holding the bag."
2021-06-04 14:55:11,stocks,I think so too. I have a bearish outlook for the long term in the stock market right now. I am slowly exiting most of my positions.
2021-06-03 23:28:31,stocks,"well at least that makes some sense...up until now all i got was attacked.  Jeez, just here to learn.

So there are new laws right now that prevent this?

All i was saying originally was that they are having a hearing to discuss changes, and I did not believe that new laws were on the books.  And I got slammed, attacked, down voted.  Am I wrong?  I do not believe i know everything..."
2021-06-04 11:31:22,stocks,lmao
2021-06-04 02:38:20,stocks,If so. I have some advice...
2021-06-04 18:47:41,stocks,Hmm even in Canada :/
2021-06-04 10:32:53,stocks,"I sold at $57 because... well frankly I made enough money on the stock while knowing next to nothing about all this. I bought 100 shares @ $5, held it to $60, then as it started going down I was like: ""Yeah, I think that's enough."" Could it keep going up, or have a gamma squeeze? Sure, but I've been holding for 6+ months and I got bills to pay, and if it starts to crash I'll just kick myself for not selling at the peak like GME.

I still have 1 share to hold on to as a little indicator / keepsake, and I might buy back in at some point, but a few months worth of rent in cash is good enough for me."
2021-06-04 08:30:35,stocks,Only a matter of time
2021-06-04 11:21:58,stocks,"You do mean millions, right?

This may not be the place for it, but check out r/SuperStonk . GME is not a meme stock, but was branded as one. It became the lynchpin that can expose a wholly corrupt system, and firewalls are being put in place to contain the blast once the DTCC and co. can’t kick the can down the road anymore.

I’m an outsider - a Uni educated teacher from Finland, very savvy with money in general and I’ve done my research. GME is a fundamentally sound investment even without the squeeze. If you’re from the US - I don’t envy you. The manipulated commercial media attacks are exhausting, but that’s on purpose. Divide and conquer tactics.

2) Herd Mentality

3) Pump and Dump

mixed into one. The strategy is sound, but it requires the use of capital most don't have. So you have to create a herd of willing participants to create large enough capitol to make a squeeze, but you have to encourage people to get in after prices have gone up and it is a clear pump and dump. The people encouraging people to put money in late in the game have an exit strategy to ensure they profit, but late entrants or early entrants who hold until the end take a loss.

Regardless of how much money was made off of the short-sellers getting out, the real advantage was to those that pull the social levers of the herd got in early and quietly knew to start leaving...while still pumping."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"With wood prices so high, curiosity struck me. Why is wood so expensive and where is all the money going? Wood is crazy expensive right now. and most seem to believe that the cost is driven by the demand for wood. But financial statements from 4 of the top 5 companies argues another excuse. According to [Sawmill DB](https://www.sawmilldatabase.com/productiontoplist.php?continent_id=998), the top 5 production mills in the US are: West Fraser, Canfor, Weyerhaeuser, Georgia Pacific (Not PT), and Resolute forests. Since GP is not publicly traded everything I share will not include them. 

One thing I noticed with all of these companies is that in the past year their stock price has sky rocketed. 

* West Fraser: 130% 

* Canfor 180%

* Weyerhaeuser 80%

* Resolute Forest **500%**

Why is their price doing this? it isn't like wsb is simping over it. 

Looking at all of their filings for the SEC tells you exactly why their price has jumped. it will also tell you why the price of wood has also skyrocketed. and it isnt a jump in demand that caused their price to raise or the price of wood to raise. These companies are just selling them for higher prices and pocketing the excess profit.

There are 4 data points that support the artificial jump in prices. Inventories, Sales, COGS, and New Earnings. below is the data for all 4 companies. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**West Fraser**


:) | Q1.2021 | Q1.2020 | increase of
---|-------|-------|-----------
Inventories | 1,137,000,000 | 735,000,000 | 21%
Sales | 2,343,000,000* | 890,000,000 | 163%
COGS | 1,039,000,000 | 630,000,000 | 65%
Selling, G and A | 78,000,000 | 41,000,000 | 90%
Net Earnings | 665,000,000 | 9,000,000(no this is not a typo) | **7289%**

*their acquisition of norbord was 707,000,000 of that unfortunately COGS for it isn't available. 

West Fraser has seen a jump in net earnings of over 7k percent. In one year they grew their net earnings by over 72x. COGS only increased by 65% which means the price of lumber or getting the lumber hasn't changed. This jump in COGS is likely due to Norbord. So even taking that out of the equation would mean they doubled their sales in a year. That is absolutely nuts. That is a profit margin that went from 2.4% to 66%. that is not normal, either. but we aren't done lets look at the other companies.

Some interesting things to point out:

* all these companies have a significant increase in profit margin. 2 of them were able to reverse their position and get positive earnings, while the other 2 were able to increase their net earnings by significant amounts. 

* in 3 of these cases, the increase in sale revenue was something to brag about. while the remaining company looks like they're geniuses for the growth they had. All of them did this with out having a huge jump in COGS. I include West Fraser in this because they acquired a company in Q1 of this year. for this reason I bet their COGS would like the same withholding their new acquisition. 

* Although ""Selling, G&A"" is not nearly as important or necessary as the others it is still necessary to show that any increase in lumber is due to labor. I assume labor is incorporated in COGS but I want to provide this for anyone reading this and wondering if they may be putting labor into a different classification. That was my first though when I saw COGS didnt jump as high as sales.

* Inventories for all companies were marginally impacted. The growth they experienced I'd say is probably just volatility due to seasonal reasons. but an interesting tidbit I want to share is that all of these companies blame the increase in prices on the pandemic claiming that it had a negative impact on the supply side. but as you can tell all companies have a growth in their inventories. All but Resolute Forest value their inventories using the lower of costs. meaning that discounting the growth in inventories should be done to a minimum. They also blame an increase of demand from people working at home for the increase in business. This makes sense. But when you include the fact that the price of wood has doubled since last year it's a little bit unreasonable to say that the massive increase in revenue is due strictly to demand side. More than likely they increased wood prices is to make up for any lack in profits they would have gotten and now they don't want to lower them because they see how much more money they're making. 

Everything I shared with you is because a friend at work noticed this with west fraser. I wanted to confirm that this was a market wide phenomenon. I think it is safe to say that the increase in wood isnt market force related but rather artificially inflated reasons. Let me know what you think in the comments. This is my first time ever sharing research I did and If I missed a crucial step I would love the critique. If I get good at doing this I will probably submit more findings I have in the future. Thank you."
2021-06-03 23:05:15,stocks,"So I’m a logger, prices of pulp wood for paper, chip board, wood pellets etc are so low that loggers are going out of business. Log prices for Hardwood lumber and veneer are up because the loggers who hand cut timber are in shorter supply. The prices are up but not extremely high. Building materials for 2x4 2x6 2x8 etc have no reason to be high, the supply end of the market is exactly the same as the pulp market. Red pine is cut by processors and the market is flooded with supply. Processor crews are actually going under also.

It basically says what other posters say: there's plenty of timber, but its the mills causing the increase. Mills shut down during COVID. Hard to reopen and find labour. Some tree farmers are thinking of starting their own mills in response, but its a huge undertaking. https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-strange-economics-of-the-lumber-market/43b4d423-4754-4716-99b1-4cbb84a75366"
2021-06-03 20:43:51,stocks,"You missed the demand and supply part of the equation and only looked at the costs and profits for the companies.

There's a limited number of sawmills and during covid they shut down and then ran at reduced capacity which led to a decrease in lumber supply. At the same time many people stuck at home did reno projects and low mortgage rates and lifestyle changes led to increased demand for lumber for construction. With a limited supply buyers will bid up prices which leads to nice profits for the companies.

In the long term, the cure for high prices is high prices - people will reduce consumption or use alternate materials and companies will open new mills or improve existing ones and prices will decline. To the point where mills are unprofitable which leads to a lack of investment which leads to lack of supply and higher prices again. Such is the commodity cycle!"

2021-06-03 23:18:50,stocks,"The simple answer is that the lumber industry intentionally shut down last year thinking the pandemic was going to kill sales. The opposite occurred and remodeling and new home construction skyrocketed. 

The shortage coupled with massive drop in available labor caused intense demand, which drove prices 2 to 3 times higher in the softwoods sector in particular. Now it’s taking months to ramp up production again. I’m being told late summer or fall before prices return back to reasonable levels."

I don’t think you’re correct in saying the demand isn’t there. For my company, the demand is so high that we’re $5 **billion** in backlog. We’ve been completely sold out of product in 2021 since February.

Not only are we producing and putting it right in the flatbed but that ALSO means that the extremely massive distribution centers are completely dry of inventory. Guess what? When consumer demand slows down (presumably in the next 2-3 months) all of these distribution centers need to fill their own inventory of product. Millions of sq ft that needs to be covered with new product.

IMO, this trend continues until 2022."

In short: Lumber jobs (not timber) suck. Low pay, hard labor, and no sense of achievement. Because of covid, a lot of laborers were laid off, and realized they didn't want to go back to those jobs. The lack of workers means a shortage of product, which means increased prices. Now add into the mix that most people are home for a year and decide to do some home improvement, demand increases even more than typical."

What the hell does this mean? They couldn't sell at higher prices if there wasn't demand at this prices- meaning there is, in fact, more demand.

All you've ""discovered"" here really is that companies that sell commodities benefit massively from an increase in the price of those commodities, because after a certain point the marginal profit is basically 100%. But everyone who knows anything about commodities already knew the so... good job?"
2021-06-03 20:45:20,stocks,"I still see this as a demand-shock.

2019 was a weak year for Lumber before Covid hit. Some saw mills had temporarily shut down.

When covid happened the sawmills shut down for awhile. They nearly deplete any reserves during the shut-downs. Despite having shorter periods of time to get lumber processed, they have inventory numbers higher than Q1 2020 and demand is far higher than 2019 and 2020.

One issue is lumber demand is cyclical. These companies are use to over-producing and storing during times of weak demand and selling reserves during higher demand periods. The lumber industry last that advantage for peak demand to occur in 2021.

&#x200B;

If one of these players could produce more, they would. It would be money in the bank. If this industry was a duopoly or possibly a triopoly, it is possible there are some game theory pricing events happening. Unless there is an unknown cartel in the background getting all of these companies working together, I just don't see why one company wouldn't try to produce more inventory right now if they could. With prices this high, I'd expect a single player to produce as much as they possibly could to make these profits.

The other issue is the growth of new trees. I'd say 1/3 of the land in Georgia is owned by a lumber/paper company. The biggest player would be Georgia-Pacific. They grow these forests, like farms. They have a distinct system set up so trees are harvested at certain times in different areas. There isn't much lee-way to farm too many trees early. Not only can they not do as much with younger trees, particularly in processing lumber, it will hurt the the following 1-2 years. They have to manage that inventory. These trees do not just grow wild that often anymore. The only benefit they have is whatever was not logged during 2020, so there much be extra supply in fields.

Then on the demand side, the stock market has done very well, unemployment is low, and millennials that went longer than previous times unable to buy a home now can. The government also spent a great deal of money, so most consumers leave the covid-era with their finances intact. Between PPP, PUA, unemployment, and economic impact payments to all tax payers, people are in the best situation to buy a home than we have been in for a few decades.  I can see where demand is picking up on home building in ways that haven't been seen since before 2008."

In fact they have less lumber lying around than they did last year it’s just valued higher. They’re shipping as much lumber as they can and many of these companies have seen railcar shortages so that explains excess lumber in inventory.

Production is indeed down as many sawmills were forced to closed due to lumber prices being so low during the start of the pandemic. And it’s taking a while for supply to get caught up to demand as we are seeing an increase in demand.

2021-06-04 06:33:25,stocks,"I am in construction and asked the same question of my materials suppliers.  What I hear back is a combination of things - high demand at mills combined with a labor shortage (who isn’t looking for good workers at the moment?).  Then there is some issue with the ports where many cargo ships cannot dock and unload, sometimes for months (I don’t know much about this?). Finally, I hear transportation driver shortages for the high demand are a problem and causing delays and supply chain disruptions at every level ( I can verify the shortage of CDL drivers is real).  Lastly, are the mills going to get every dollar that they can?  Of course - construction is red hot right now, but once interest rates go up, construction will come to an abrupt halt, so make money while u can, whether it be the mills or the carpenter building the homes."
2021-06-04 06:36:29,stocks,Ive been reading these guys are holding stock and artificially driving the price up by creating supply issues. So looks like a 2x4 will never be 2 bucks again.
2021-06-04 06:48:58,stocks,Sounds like a cartel.  Maybe they need to be looked into for agreeing to prices instead of the usual compete for business model.

2021-06-04 07:34:03,stocks,"I tried to find the video I watched a few months ago about the rising cost of COVID, but I can't find it. If I do, I promise I'll link it.

One of the best lines to come from the video was from an economist who said: ""Like the pharmaceutical industry, prices will continue to rise not because of an issue of supply and demand, because they can and no one will stop them.""

This was in response to the growing prices of meat, not lumber. As I watch nearly \*every\* industry raising prices and getting away with it while trying to blame COVID, I see another example of uncontrolled systemic greed.

I'm sure COVID can be the reason for some price increases, but not like this. Lumber has increased over 500% in places.

This isn't a COVID issue. It's a human greed issue.

What's worse in all this: prices will never come back down. As people pay for the increase, they're literally telling these businesses their prices can be paid.

It's exactly what happened when our oil prices started to go up. Companies raised prices, but once the US introduced fracking to offset imported oil and prices devastated the world, our prices never came back down.

If people don't stop buying lumber immediately to send a message, get ready for even higher home prices.

It's ludicrous this all is happening because of greed, while blaming a convenient virus."

The federal government is attacking energy. As an example if you shut down pipelines you’re going to increase the cost of fuel. Fuel is needed any every single stage of production. Everything goes up and gets passed onto the consumer, you.

There is a labor shortage. The economy was kicking into high gear however federal unemployment benefits are still here. For a large chunk of people you can make just about as much money not working. Why should that guy be driving the truck that delivers wood? Why should there be a guy stocking shelves? This reverberates throughout the economy.

Lastly off the top of my head, inflation. The government has spent an ungodly amount of money within the last year and they show absolutely no signs of stopping. I believe it’s something like one in five dollars in circulation was created last year. It’s hard to visualize the insane amount of government spending on top of their already bloated regular spending. It’s a tax no one gets to vote on.

Lumber demand is at an all time high in the states as well.  Weather its from new home sales or Remoldes contractor are booked  through most of the year. 

So rising costs in processing and high demand = higher prices.  My guess is that only small parts of the supply chain are seeing large increase in profit because of the increase price"

2021-06-03 21:34:29,stocks,"I am a commercial GC... there are a lot of variables. After the housing bubble burst in 2008 a lot of lumber mills closed down, the larger ones became more efficient on handling the slow increase demand in the coming decade. Enter 2018, construction started to boom increased demand but big dogs were able to keep up. Start COVID, mills shut down, supply chains shut down people quit working... what we see then is an upward demand in people starting to do home projects, but less supply and less efficiency in getting materials to suppliers. Construction stayed working while the rest of the world shut down. My jobs did not stop the demand was there even when the supply wasnt available which has been carrying on and compounding.  We as a whole were not able to cut down and process as many trees as needed to keep up with demand. Combine that with increased transport costs, and fuel....

Due to COVID and quarantine people also have more money to do projects. The crazy thing is that it's not slowing down, even with the increasing in price we are seeing and increase in demand. As of now from our suppliers we are expected to peak Jan 2022. There is not stopping this, the price is rising due to supply and demand, there is no extra money, it's companies trying to expand with the pace of demand but also not get caught in a bubble of having hired too many extras when the demand starts to reside."

Then you take into account that covid made work difficult  and wood reserves probably wained as demand and supply moved inversely. To get back to supply/demand equilibrium companies increase prices."
2021-06-03 21:50:44,stocks,"I know dick about lumber company financials, but wood is hot in sustainable architecture. It is by far the best, most sustainable alternative to architectural steel. Can’t really beat Nature when it comes to growing skyscrapers without ripping up the ground. 

Wood is going to stay hot in architecture, the first wood skyscrapers were just recently finished. 

Lumber can absolutely be sourced sustainably, it just hasn’t been historically. We’ve now developed tools that will enable us to accurately valuate ecosystem services associated sustainable management, and act accordingly and adaptively. Big satellites good. Realtime global data good. Former Reddit guy who didn’t die is actually killing it on the reforesting front (unless shit imploded in the while since I read about it). 

Swiss RE’s BES index for Biodiversity & Ecosystem Services is also a great first step towards the kind of valuation metric we need. Gives operators (and regulators) a sense of the true cost of clear cutting v. Spot cutting, monoculture replanting v. ecological communities, and if there’s any value in reviving Japanese [Daisugi](https://www.boredpanda.com/sustainable-japanese-forestry-daisugi/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic) forestry, beyond the funky aesthetic.

Also, if we put some limits on sprawl and mandated density we’d still use a bunch of wood like we are just endlessly sprawling. Wood is the only option for building up (adding density) where a full demo isn’t an option. 

If we were capable of intelligent collective action, we would support the Jobs Plan and ensure that the billions targeting energy efficiency and building retrofits also support a circular economy by supporting lumber recovery and restoration businesses. That’s going to be high-value activity going forward, and potentially a smart investment target. If we were capable of intelligent collective action, I mean."

TLDR: 1) lots of mills closed 08’ crash and in 2019 due to crash in lumber price and trump tariffs 2) at the onset of pandemic mills cleared their inventory and stopped production for a bit; 3) record demand from DIY projects, renovations and new home construction caught everyone off guard, 4) the industry can’t ramp up supply capacity easily and won’t because they got burned in 06-07 when they did that.

So yeah, the companies cut production costs and the demand went up. Of course they are going to profit more as a result. I don't really think it was intentional either. 

And now, the shortage continues to exist and prices remain high because even at max capacity the mills can't keep up with the demand, and there is no reason for sawmills to build more mills for a temporary demand increase, because when demand levels out again, they will have excess capacity that remains unused, but still costs them money."

Let me tell you the story:

&#x200B;

Covid occured.

&#x200B;

about 30% of trucking companies went out of business due to covid. They are no longer on the roads. That is an enormous loss of capacity.

Do you need something shipped today? yes? well there are 5 trucks for 250 shipments. They will demand a high rate.

There isn't an industry touched and every component requires more demand. 

Shipments have a 26 week time out of china. When I was importing pre covid it was about 4. Whoever pays the most for the freight get's it.

It boils down to who will pay."
2021-06-03 22:50:10,stocks,"This was explained as a relationship between *actually keeping up with demand — and fulfilling needs for local supply* that drove the price up at individual local locations. 

See, inventory is up because lumber mills never stopped. However, fulfillment of inventory at any individual, given supply front, was impacted when trucking and delivery was, and has, literally not been able to keep up with moving all of this lumber around the world. Thus, your local lumber suppliers get to jack up prices to meet demand where their supply can’t keep up — whether they wanted it to or not, you can’t go to anybody with enough wood on any given days sometimes *despite the 2-3x prices*.

There’s some interesting articles on this that have popped up recently I’d recommend reading through. It’s amazing how working from home for so many people started trending last year and was the catalyst for this in an already exploding real estate economy. There are some places in the world that are even mostly not impacted by people wanting to move to these states and into newly built homes... but large city centers and states in the US that already saw 500k+ people migrating in a year? They’re now peaking at 1m+ over the past year since people can actually go anywhere now. Housing markets are in a climb for which, $200k homes just 2 years ago now go for $250-300k appraisal but then end up selling for $50k over asking, nevermind new construction won’t be sold because holding them for another month or two means they go up in value some 4-5%. 

That is... if the material was there and it was already being built. Some projects have stopped entirely because contractors projected cost to build at half of what it costs now, *and now*? Homes can’t be built for more than it cost to build them in a lot of cases. They won’t resume because developers actually don’t have the cash in hand to pay for the material, even if they could turn a profit from it.

Also, if they do FIFO accounting, that'd account for low cogs on the onset of higher revenues this year. Now if they want to maintain those margins, they will have to charge higher prices for the subsequent higher cost in cogs.

2021-06-03 23:30:09,stocks,I heard the price of plywood and other sheets of wood going up has to do with a shortage in the production of glue. guess you can't start up glue factories and start producing overnight. doesn't make sense about straight cut lumber tho.

As far as I know. Covid has companies not producing as much. Then with so many people at home making just as much money and in alot of cases more on unemployment with the extra 300 a week. They have time at home and money to fix their homes. Workers are not returning to work the mills. Then you have to consider the hurricanes and forest fires that's why lumber is high. Now that spring has arrived and the contractors are back to work they were getting first dibs on dibs mainly the large contractors. We had a guy who would buy off us in bulk during winter so we could hit our sales goals. We make 7 points for framing packages to the big boys and about 14 points for the home owners and smaller contractors. Even the trex company is backed up it's a two month wait for them to get the orders out. And it it backed up by 6 mounts for shingles. Unless you are a shingle hub.

2021-06-04 00:28:48,stocks,"The story of a market wide conspiracy seems compelling, I looked at the Weyerhaeuser MD&A for some clues. 

As an auditor, here are some things I think you should keep in mind as you continue this research: 

1. Sales is only an indicator of orders that are/can be filled and a weak indicator of demand. It is possible for sales to go up 20% but that doesn’t mean demand is up 20%. It could be higher overall sales prices and a different product mix. 

2. Inventories are at a point in time while Sales and COGS are for a period of time. It would be better if you looked at average inventories, the mix of products, and the related margins. I think this would also explain why margins are increasing more than inventories. For Weyerhaeuser looks like the decreased their inventories of woodchips and were holding more construction related lumber with higher margins. 


3. Freight costs and labor are included in a few places - freight costs and labor used to process inventory would be included in inventory until the item is sold and moved to COGS. SG&A labor would be sales teams, management, and other non-production staff. 

These are just some quick thoughts I typed, but hopefully they will take your research some interesting places!"

2021-06-04 03:25:30,stocks,"I think it's really strange to suspect something artificial here when you've only looked at one possibility. It's logistics and inventory. Inventory was not stockpiled due to projected downturn in demand, demand did not drop but actually rebounded quickly and bigger than expected. Logistics are fucked with everyone waiting which means...prices go up for what's available. Everything is waiting in line to get moved. Look at how long freight is waiting to move. That is fucking our system right now big time."

2021-06-04 03:38:12,stocks,"This was an interesting read, but it sounds to me like you literally just described supply and demand. If firms can hike prices and continue making profit, then demand has obviously gone up, or no one would be willing to pay. I don't think it's right to talk about ""artificially"" inflated prices, the price level is either right or it adjusts till it is. Whether or not it's ethical or in the best interests of society is another matter.."

2021-06-04 03:56:05,stocks,"Hi there, thank you for putting this information together, this is a very good discussion to have. The numbers you pointed out shows a very simplistic picture of what’s happening right now. But you’re right that the lumber business itself hasn’t changed much... so why in drastic increase in prices? Besides the supply and demand imbalances, the biggest factor is monetary policies. Because of COVID-19 the fed has lowered the interest rate to basically 0% and is doing massive and I mean MASSIVE QE aka money printing. So liquidity is everywhere. Mountains of cash and credit chasing the same amount of goods drastically increases prices. This is the most QE the US has printed in history. You can see supply shortages and price increase across the board for all commodities as well.

Further, lot of people are not talking about this is the tariffs the U.S. is slapping on Canada for lumber. Traditionally Canada supplies the U.S. with 60 to 80% of their lumber consumption. That is a huge amount. These tariffs are only going to hurt consumers at the end because of the US lumber lobbyists self interest (US Lumber coalition). If people are going to point the fingers at someone it’s them."

2021-06-04 08:03:13,stocks,"Sorry OP but this analysis is barely surface level.

Today's sawmills are super complex automated factories. I'd imagine they run them year round near capacity. [This isn't Leroy and Skeeter driving around rural areas with their Dodge Ram and WoodMizer picking up logs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvbgwdTGoyo).

Right now there's an increase in demand. That doesn't mean these sawmills are going to go out and spend 10s of millions to build a new sawmill at an overinflated price (all commodities are high right now, takes a lot of steel to make a sawmill). The demand will eventually subside and they'd never get their investment back on the new sawmill.

Then take into account the shit that went down in Texas and all the other supply chain disruptions.

> I think it is safe to say that the increase in wood isnt market force related but rather artificially inflated reasons.

This statement doesn't even make sense... It's pretty simple. Demand > Supply so prices go up. Those are market forces."

One of the largest and most populous US states has millions of homes destroyed by pipe bursts and flooding, during the the largest remodeling and addition bursts we’ve seen since the 2008 crash, and that’s not relevant because you pulled some inventory data. Come on now. The Texas lumber market has drained surrounding states and put an abnormal burden on supply lines throughout the country. Similar bumps can be seen in wire, pipes etc, because all of those houses needed to be rebuilt."

2021-06-04 09:08:38,stocks,COVID did 2 things: it shut down production and increased demand.  What didn't happen is trees stop growing or being harvested.  The glut of oversupply allowed for the mills to charge whatever they wanted for raw timber which squeezed out the growers.

On top of this the money supply has almost doubled in the last year meaning commodity prices would double from inflation regardless of changes in supply and demand .but demand for commodities is up because construction has been on hold for a year and supplies are down because of covid the combination of all this is leading to what I think will only be the start of skyrocketing prices in commodities for the next year or two not just wood there’s worldwide shortages in glass, steel, copper , platinum , semiconductors the list goes on i have been moving all my money into producers of these because they will be able to charge whatever they want for years to come"
2021-06-04 09:24:04,stocks,"From working within the construction industry for the last 2 months I can tell you what I see (obviously not an expert).

Obviously, 2020 was one of the roughest years for construction because of COVID. People put projects on the back burner while the world was ending. This created shocks within supply chains, with some of these supply chain units also having COVID issues in the workplace. So we have Supply issues there, the companies weren't ready and some ill-equipped to go back to 100% production.

&#x200B;

Then 2021 comes along, people start feeling better about COVID and want to pick up their projects again. Plus you have new projects coming in as you normally would. We now have 2 years worth of demand being squeezed into 1 year, so demand is through the roof.

&#x200B;

Lower supply AND higher demand? Our equilibrium prices just shifted and the cost is a hell of a lot higher. This could very easily be the new norm for the industry if new supply chain units don't come in an disturb the market."

Production is also down because there are 7,000,000+ jobs with nobody to fill them and the government is printing money like crazy and handing it out to people who aren't working.  Stuff not being produced = less stuff = higher demand = price increase.  With the dollar bottoming out, people are also spending crazy amounts to get these raw materials.  The media lies; hyperinflation is here. The only reason we haven't felt it completely yet is because the dollar is a reserve currency for the global economy.  Russia already dropped it due to inflation. It was something crazy like 25% of all USD currently in circulation were printed in 2020."

You could have 100 units of inventory last year that was worth $1,000. But this year you might have 50 units left that are worth $1,500.  It could even be the same physical units after 50 were sold if there was an inventory revaluation.

2021-06-04 11:40:49,stocks,So I'm a painter and the construction business mainly do the residential side here in the Middle America and me and the guys I work with were talking about this a few weeks back and one of the guys said that he was listening to a podcast (of course I don't know which one!) And was saying that in the podcast they spoke about the rising lumber prices as a way to hedge against inflation. Meaning they're expecting large amount of inflation with prices of all kinds of consumer goods and so they wanted to jump their price up pre hyperinflation! This is way too simplified and I realize and I didn't listen to the podcast itself but it does give some modicum of possible reason why albeit  not a good one

2021-06-04 15:38:12,stocks,"I'm not making a 1-1 comparison with this, but I do think there are some similarities. I work for a hot tub manufacturer and this is how they were affected:

1) **Reduced labor force.**  
Initial COVID scare led to ***manufacturing*** positions being reduced. Both from people leaving to collect unemployment, as well as layoffs. Some of those layoffs were attempts to comply with distancing mandates. This all happened fast. Company heads asked desk jobs to volunteer temporary pay cuts if able. (Company heads stopped taking pay). They were scrambling in an attempt to take care of the maximum number of people as best they could.

2) **Focus on long term company survival**   
As the scare died down and company began to realize that they were going to survive at least for a few months, they began shifting business models to extend into long term survival. This meant we dropped all our existing project plans and shifted to a more online/virtual friendly environment. It worked.

3) **Unexpected sales trends**   
Sales recovered quickly. Far more so than we anticipated. And manufacturing was beginning to fall behind due to the reduced work force. Before understanding why, hiring was slow to create more positions in fear of having to go through layoffs again. They still hired, but slowly. Even still, the line workers were far more susceptible to COVID. It was not a simple ""hire more people"" solution.

4) **Careful response to record sales**  
Strain got worse and worse. Sales were hitting record highs. The speculation was ""more people staying home, able to spend their cancelled travel funds on home improvements."" Manufacturing would have struggled with the demand even outside of COVID regulations. With the prospect of such high sales and after putting together a plan, manufacturing gave the green light for aggressive growth and created extra shifts, better pay plans and benefits, and started hiring. People were slow to start working, and quick to quit. But they still wanted to be careful not to grow too big only to watch the sales plummet again and lead to more layoffs.

5) **Part suppliers begin to struggle**  
6-8 months in, and ***finally*** starting to see some ""catching up"" trends. Line worker attrition started slowing down. Production started catching up to sales (even though we were now on 6-8 month backorder). The plans were working... until... some of our parts suppliers got hit and began reducing our orders. On our end, we were now able to handle production for the most part, but one supplier in particular was is such high demand that **they** couldn't keep up. So our production slowed dramatically once again.

6) **Finally stabilizing, but way behind**  
Now, like 1-2 months ago, we just barely got a handle on that issue. But we are still 4-6 months behind on fulfilling orders.

Labor markets within production and manufacturing got hit the hardest based on what I have seen. Where wood is far more popular than hot tubs, this makes a ton of sense to me."

2021-06-04 18:01:19,stocks,"Unfortunately, supply and demand are never instant. What we’re seeing here is the effects from two different problems. The first was the tariff on Canadian lumber. 20% tax on imported lumber caused a similar price increase. Who did you think would ultimately be paying that? The industry or the consumer? Then demand soared through the pandemic. Supply couldn’t keep up at first so the prices rocketed. Demand has stabilized but the cost is still high. The high cost will ultimately cause demand to plummet. Ultimately, the failure on the industry’s side to react to demand changes will mean the excess inventory start being sold cheaper and cheaper. News flash, wood is difficult to store. Temperature, humidity,  it all affects loose lumber differently. I’d imagine hundreds of tons will go to waste or be repurposed (as chip or pulp). Before anyone argues that lumber can be stored indoors indefinitely, remember that it costs money to have that indoor space. 

Supply and demand causes this sort of thing regularly. Just like a stock being overbought and oversold, I can almost guarantee the will be a correction soon."

This time next year expect to be paying at least $25 for a single sheet of 1/2” osb. *the majority of our lumber is forested inside the US, shipped across the border to be processed, then shipped back.*"

He is partnered with a mill and yard who fulfill his orders and bank roll his inventory and credit. Anyways, he told my dad he is just printing money lately. Said he did so good in Q1 he might just have to accelerate retirement a few years. 

Another anecdote. My dad was talking to a guy he used to compete against. Since my dad sold his business this guy has been consolidating independent mills and yards into a fairly large company with a presence in all the southwest and most of the west (US). Anyways, this guy told my dad that his worst salesperson got a $100k commission check in May.

2021-06-03 23:42:26,stocks,"I've worked with commodities for several years and this is the best explanation on here. 

Consolidation of companies and a long term trend of shutting down small mills, leaving a limited number of ultra giant super efficient processing centers. When those centers have any disruption what so ever there is very few places to turn. This has happened in energy. This has happened in ammunition. This has happened with meat prices.  

Soaring demand and a disrupted bottle neck in the supply chain. 

The op is looking at financials asking the right questions but would benefit looking at the basic costing equation: Price x Volume = Reported $ Figure (whether sales or cogs). When you answer for both of those variables you can come to a more sound conclusion. Just because sales $ are up and cogs $ is flat does not give the full picture. 

Some examples: Is it common for mills to contract timber purchases out several months? That could explain a flat cogs number. Is lumber sold spot or contracted out? The current market could look good for mills but what happens when demand plummets? Are the mills still on the hook to purchase timber at the same prices?  The timber industry could have a more steady flow of funds from long term contracts and the lumber mills have greater long term market risk. Its all theoretical till you can answer for specifics of how those markets work. The podcast from this post is a great start."

The demand is not coming from Tom, Dick, and Harry who all decided to build that shed finally during the pandemic.  Their consumption is up, but still negligible.

2021-06-04 07:57:49,stocks,"I also did a deep dive and found the same increase in profits.  They are not price gouging they are responding to a huge increase in demand where people are literally bidding up the price of their product.  Demand for lumber had been down prepandemic because slowing housing demand.  Blame tiny houses, blame environmentalism(smaller houses better), urbanism, millennials delaying home-buying.  With lower demand they shut older less efficient mills down and ran more efficient mills at higher capacity with no room for expansion.  Then the pandemic hit and they expected a deeper recession with slower housing starts so they reduced more capacity.  Then.... the exact opposite happened.  Demand shot through the roof and everyone believes its temporary so no increase in capacity.  Supply down demand up, people started bidding prices up.  No mustache twisting, just lower capacity due to a shadow recession in building and unlucky planning at the beginning of the pandemic.

The places that buy corn from farmers get their base price from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, stock market for agriculture. The plant may pay more or less, but the base price is from the CME.

2021-06-03 20:27:34,stocks,It is not just international shipping.  Rail flat cars for lumber are overbooked across Canada and the United States.  So lumber companies have been using more eighteen wheelers for transport which costs 2-3x as much.

We’re going to see some sort of transition program to make people current and tack the balance onto the end as long as they keep paying.   So much in our economy is drive by housing prices we are not going to do anything to cause them to decline significantly.

We felt that when Covid hit Sawmills slowed down production and never put effort into increasing it again, thus creasing a supply crunch in a period of massive demand. To me it makes sense the profit margins are sky rocketing as any piece of wood that sits on there lot unsold is just appreciating rapidly in price. We stopped buying wood earlier this year because the price delivered to our mill was $920, which after a month would've been a bargain. 10 years ago the price for what we were buying was around $300, then peaking at $700 around 2018 (which seemed insanely high). Prices now are now double what we last bought for in spring. Mill closures and freight costs have played a big role in making a frustrating buyers experience.

Weed wacking is almost $100/hr right now where I live because this guy amd several others are booked solid.  

There are a few key issues here imo and they all work together to exacerbate things:


1. Stim money and pent up spending is creating a cash grab.       People are charging it because people are paying it.


2. What people did to pass the time during covid was highly viral.  Buying TP, jigsaw puzzles, meme stocks... home improvement.  So there's extra demand, tons of people halfway done with something.

3. There are a fair number of people in trades that just work on an as needed basis.  Every plumber, carpenter, and earth mover I know is saying it's super hard to find help right now.

It takes quite some time and not an insignificant amount of money to ramp up production - would you want to have spent $50-100m to build additional capacity only for the market to go belly up?

Most mills have done a lot of analysis and see that supply will eventually even out in the next year or so, so instead they run their equipment 24x7 and hire a few more workers to keep things running rather than pony out a ton of money/time/effort for what they would likely never be able to earn back.

However the prices here have jumped just as high as they have everywhere else. 

I’m really uneducated around stocks and supply and demand so excuse my ignorance ahead of time. I’m just baffled as to why the prices have risen so much here. From what I’ve read other areas of the US do have a lumber shortage, so maybe the prices are more justified in other areas?"

It's simply not true.  Refiners generally make much more money with lower oil costs.   Some of their products,  such as coke, asphalt, and sulfur are low value,  so they lose money on those portions of the barrel with high oil costs.  They make money on margin, so there are generally some winners and losers depending on how their supply specifically is impacted. 

Upstream oil producers only make more money if their supply isn't disrupted.  If there is a disruption on an Exxon oil field,  exxon doesn't benefit from that rise in costs; their competitors do"

2021-06-04 13:20:59,stocks,"I don't think a ""modest"" demand increase is a proper way to describe it. Housing is red hot, home builders have massive backlogs which leads to increased demand on building materials. Home owners undertook record # of renovations (though that's probably cooled with the high prices now).

I guess I missed supply chain inefficiencies in my 100 word TLDR as well.

Even with inventories flat (or higher) from 2020 to 2021, you still need to get that lumber to the end user. Anecdotally speaking but there was a period where you couldn't find ANY lumber at the stores. The entire shipping industry is under strain which pushes prices up.

I think it's too simplistic and naiive to say there's collusion and price fixing, but that's just my opinion."
2021-06-04 11:59:59,stocks,"I disagree when they are doing it in a anticompetitive or monopolistic manner.

Not only that, but practices like these are also pricing new generations out of a home, or even forcing some of those who able to get into a home out of it.

You see someone who's ""saved enough for an emergency"". Suddenly their cushion is almost completely wiped due to the cost of emergency home repair, then yeh, I think that's a problem. (Contractors quoting 20+k for shingle and partial decking replacement on a 1800 sq/ft, single story, ranch home roof). In fact, they've had multiple Contractors withdraw quotes because of volatile materials pricing.

Something is fucky, and just because it's not a necessity such as medical equipment/PPE/sanitary consumables (as we saw with C19), doesn't mean it shouldn't be squawked. In fact, it's doing exactly that which aids in bringing everything back to median (or should given competition able to step in and prosper, demand subsides, or it brings about *gag* government intervention)."

In my experience the mill pays for the standing timber and pays the logging company to cut it and truck it.  I've seen it done more conventionally, with the loggers paying for standing timber and then selling it to mills, but the way it was explained to me is the loggers like being under contract because they negotiate it so their profits might be a bit less but they're guaranteed to make something.  Also, the timber industry is pretty volatile in the best of times by me a paper mill just recently shutdown and they consumed 60% of the timber felled in the state so the market took a huge hit."

2021-06-04 00:04:17,stocks,"When the rates go up, everyone across the board will be a little bit poorer causing prices to level. A mortgage is either going toward an inflated price tag or a higher interest rate, but what sets the baseline for what people can afford is their total monthly payment.  If I buy a house when rates are higher I can hope that rates will go down allowing me to pocket the buyers greater purchasing power when I go to sell (the reason everyone wants to sell now, but no one wants to have to buy)  It also gives me the ability to refinance if rates do go down.  If I buy when rates are rock bottom that means when I go to sell, more likely than not, rates will have increased, meaning the price tag is less likely to increase during the period of time for which I hold the house, and even puts the value at risk of decreasing.  People think rock bottom interests rates are great but they're worse than a wash if that money is just going to inflated price tags."

2021-06-04 02:21:36,stocks,What other years has the housing market crashed (other than 2008)? Genuinely curious.
2021-06-04 01:26:35,stocks,"Look at housing prices vs incomes in Asian countries.  Here’s the list.  

https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/rankings_by_country.jsp

You see in the past housing has been CRAZY cheap compared to incomes in the us.  A house in a desirable area is something that can be passed down from generation to generation. It’s not something that is expended or worth much less when your done paying for it like a car. 

Your not wrong housing may crash again but overall we are seeing a trend of housing in the us reverting to more of the global average as well as inflation making hard assets more valuable.  

Even at these “inflated” prices housing is nearly a sure fire way to increase your wealth significantly since you can borrow 97% of the purchase cost at insanely low rates and pay it back over 30 years.  And in many states if prices do crash you also can legally walk away (non recourse) and the bank can’t come after you for the money you owe.  So essentially if you have good income and can come up with 3% of the cost you get all the upside of a historically appreciating hard asset. Your downside is capped at your down payment (and bad credit for a few years).  And you get to pay back the 97% with depreciating dollars over 30 years.  Your setup to win in every possible way. And if by some chance housing drops like crazy the whole country is going to be in the shitter until we print a bunch more stimulus money to push it back up."

2021-06-04 14:55:02,stocks,"I know what you mean but pricing will level off & then retreat likely back to levels of a couple years ago. Companies all ride these supply constraint periods to increase profit spreads and many do share some with their base employees. Walmart, Home D, and Lowes among others were all giving out nice bonuses last year as their business spiked due to the stimulus checks and the shutdown of restaurant and travel business. It's bad luck/timing if you have a property emergence during this period but is about the same if your personal vehicle has to be promptly replaced and pricing for both used and new is at peak(and unseen before) levels. Electrical, metals, and probably plumbing  all seem to be currently near the same price escalations."

Looks to me as an illegal cartel, when common action leads to superprofits simply because there is no market in that segment. Gotta be regulated, and because of that, insured.

Many small landlords are similar to the corner market or local barber shop, hardware store, etc. Suppose you had saved money and purchased eight or 10 medium sized single family homes or condos with the intention of renting them out as extra income or possibly a start to a small business. You have constant expenses occurring such as taxes, insurance possibly even mortgage if they're financed. Maintenance is constantly required(think of your own home). Large rental corporations with thousands of properties can probably weather the storm with clever tax accounting and write downs(they're like Walmart, Home Depot or Great Clips in the above comparison)  If several of the locally owned landlord's properties are not paying their rents and is OK'd to do so by the government decree, this directly affects the landlord, possibly he relies on this income for his family. Usually the first thing that will fall off is the property maintenance that can lead to a gradual downgrade of entire neighborhoods."

We use a lot of hardwoods for our lumber, and Canada is about our biggest supplier. Unfortunately the tariffs, combined with a nasty beetle infection that killed off about 25% of their trees, is driving that price through the roof as well.

Our entire supply chain, based on the idea of ""just-in-time"" materials, was flawed in it's inception. Rather than taking a look at what materials are critical to production, companies just decided that any excess inventory was bad.

Toyota, which pioneered the concept, actually re-assessed the way they sourced materials after the earthquake a few years back devastated Japan. They realized that things like plastics, metal and glass were easily sourced from alternative suppliers, but things like computer chips were not. Since it costs billions of dollars and a couple years to build or expand a chip manufacturing plant Toyota realized that computer chips were a critical bottleneck. So they actually purchased excess computer chip inventory for 2-3 months of production.

Toyota is the largest automotive manufacturer in the world, and right now, the only one not affected by the computer chip shortage."

>Rising Interest Rates and Property Value  
Rising interest rates do have a very noticeable effect on buyers and sellers. Hypothetical situations prove that property value and housing prices directly correlate to mortgage rates, but what underlies both scenarios is the health of the economy.  
If the economy grows fast enough, rising mortgage rates will not have as great an effect on property value and housing prices. For example, if mortgage rates increase one point, monthly payments increase by $238. However, a strong economy allows employers to increase salaries enough to help compensate for the rising interest rate. As long as the economy continues to grow, and we continue to see job growth and wage growth, a rise in interest rates should not paralyze the housing market.

Meat is generally quite expensive around here. Ground beef will cost you €13/kg or around $7/lb, for example. Beef is especially expensive though, I can get 1kg of chicken filet for €15, better quality ones costing €28.

In fact groceries in general are expensive, my GF and I very rarely buy meat (she is vegetarian and there’s no point cooking a meal just for me), yet we still need at least $480-600/month for groceries in total. 

One thing though is that groceries here are extremely good quality compared to other countries. It’s not like you pay a lot but get shit back, I really notice the difference when going to another country."

Copies get to competitors through their staff and channel partners. Announce an increase themselves.
Companies want to grow and claim business from competitors but it is hard to do. It is easier to push a price increase with existing customers. If lead dog does it, because they can, everyone else follows.

Stocks dipped today, with the three major indexes pulling back after a recent run of gains in the last two weeks. Seems like after the recent run of gains we are seeing some profit taking across the board. I see no real reason for the dip given that new economic data released today was overwhelmingly positive. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for May’s Job Report slated to be released tomorrow.

Amid negotiations with Republican lawmakers regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, today, the Washington Post reported that President Biden was open to reconsidering his previous proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to from 21% to 28%. This proposed increase has been one of the main sticking points during negotiations. Now it is reported Biden would recommend a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. 

We got two pieces of good news in the labor market today. On one hand, according to a report by payroll processing firm ADP, the private sector added 978,000 jobs in May, well ahead of consensus estimates of 650,000. On the other hand, according to the Labor Department’s Weekly Jobless claim report, showed 385,000 new jobless claims, roughly in-line with 387,000 estimate and a fresh pandemic low, a great sign that the labor market is improving as the economy continues to recover. 

These reports set the stage for the official May Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which will be critical in determining the pace of economic recovery and whether the Federal Reserve will consider tapering monetary support in the near future. The April Job Report was extremely disappointing, showing only 266,000 jobs added compared to the 1 million expected, and marking a sharp deceleration compared to March. 

**Highlights**

* Extremely volatile trading continued in AMC, which saw it’s stock price recover from roughly 30% down to more than 10% up and only to dip again towards the end of the day. Other “meme stocks” traded in similar patterns after rocketing up in the last few days. 
* AMC issues and additional 11 million shares today, with the company taking advantage of its surging stock price. 
* Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday pointed to potential ""supply constraints"" beginning in the summer after a ""more robust"" recovery from the coronavirus-related downturn than he had imagined, another sign that demand is catching up in many industries faster than supply as the economy roars back from the coronavirus-induced recession.
* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue
* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. 
* Jack Ma's Ant Group has been approved to run a consumer finance company, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said Thursday. This is one of the first step of Ant's forced restructuring after China pulled the plug on its $35 billion IPO in October 2020. It also means the company will be regulated more like a traditional financial entity, giving authorities more oversight over company operations

I'm looking to purchase stock in this company (I happen to like it despite dire China warnings etc and know Arket, Cos and Stories are serious international growth brands). I trade through Fidelity which offers both HNNMY and HMRZF, one being a multiple of 5 of the other. I believe the former is the ADR of the company which is Swedish, and the latter is the otc stock itself. Just want to confirm that. And is there any particular reason I should buy shares of one vs. the other? Thinking I'll go with the HNNMY, the ADR, but want to make sure. Thanks in advance!"
2021-06-04 00:00:00,stocks,"margin interactive brokers question I have CAD in my account, I use about 3x leverage to daytrade for the past 3 months, I notice on my daily statements though theres a $-20 or $+70 and fluctuates between those amounts under “forex” 

when im purchasing funds with margin am I buying with USD then when selling is it converting back to CAD?


im just stumped because under forex today it showed -$70 no idea how thats even possible"
2021-06-04 08:53:14,stocks,"Yes, it is visual thing and hence I believe, when you put base currency as CAD, it seems to be more of mark to market, without actual transfer between currencies.

Consider this simpler example:

Day 1: 1000 USD
Exchange rate: 1.2 on day 1
Hence, CAD value: 1200 by day 1

Day 2:1100 USD (100 dollar profit from trades)
Exchange rate:1.25 on day 2
Hence, final CAD value 1375 (1100*1.25)

A simpler report may mention you made 175 CAD profit in a day.


This 1375 value also be mentioned in a detailed report as, 

New 100 USD profit = 125 CAD profit

Same 1000 USD carried from yesterday = 1250 CAD today (today's ex rate 1.25)

So,

It can be reported as two separate entries, 

Capital gains made = 125 CAD
Forex gain = 50 CAD (pure forex change from yesterday)

Total = 1375 CAD

Such a report helps to understand what comes from capital gains profit and what part is due to pure FX fluctuation.

If you however want to make things easier, you can make your base currency as USD, if you only do US markets, so as not to see these reporting changes."

Also, if I sold ETSY for a loss not only could I write it off but put the money into something like AMD, BA, or HP which I'm looking to buy more of or start a position in.

So let's just let's take the China FUD out of the equation, and make believe that in a hypothetical universe, China wasn't threatening to invade Taiwan every 30 seconds, genociding ethnic and religious minorities, imprisoning journalists, and suspending free elections. How much would Ali Baba actually be worth? I'm seeing crazy price targets in the thousands.... but it all sounds like wishful thinking. 

It generates sales of 39.9 billion vs Amazon's 232 billion, and it's revenue is about 71 billion vs Amazon's 386.1 billion. 

Amazon seems to already be intrenched in Asian markets, making 30% of online sales in India for instance. Unlike the early 2000's, online retail is no longer a new frontier market, so I just don't get how Ali Baba quadruples it's sales and revenue without Amazon doing the same. 

In fact, right now it's Market cap is 588 billion, vs Amazon's 1.6 trillion, so it has about 1/3 the market cap of Amazon despite having less then 1/5 of the sales and revenue. Doesn't that signal investors are actually bullish on Baba and not bearish? The narrative I've always been hearing is ""Ali Baba is significantly undervalued because of Chinese FUD"" and yet the numbers would appear that it might be overvalued despite the Chinese FUD. 

Sorry if I'm missing something, I'm kind of an amateur. I don't mean to annoy people by asking a question that's repeatedly asked, I'm just hoping to start a conversation about Ali Baba's actual value as a company without the politics behind it."

2021-06-03 21:46:24,stocks,"You're insane if you think that Huawei, SMIC, etc. are fundamentally different from other Chinese technology companies. 

Every company in China answers to the CCP. And the CCP can utilize them at any time for intelligence, military, etc. purposes via government contracts, just like the Pentagon can sign government contracts with Palantir, Microsoft, etc.

Now, at the moment Biden is targeting military & surveillance related companies, but it'd be an easy transition to targeting areas like *social credit*, which Alibaba is involved with, and *propaganda*, which Tencent is involved with. Companies like JD can be targeted for utilizing or selling products made with slave labor and companies like Nio will surely be involved in military logistics contracts and surveillance via vehicle tracking.

So yeah, this precedence allows the US to ban investment in any Chinese technology company at any time, and since all large companies are moving towards being technology companies, this is a blank check for the US to ban investment in ANY large Chinese company.

This makes Chinese stocks INCREDIBLY risky and that's why Chinese stocks have been doing so badly in the last few months despite solid fundamental & a growing economy. Because the market operates six months to a year in advance and they learned of the rumors of Biden's black list long before you.

We're in a Cold War and people here still pretend that it's business as usual. Invest in Chinese companies at your own risk."

His petulant response spurred China to immediately copy and steal US technology leader Fastly's technology and cut ties mid-quarter.  That really kneecapped what had been a bright light in American technology leadership.  

What China did was wrong, but it was retaliation and rational in the context of his tantrum.  

Just a reminder, his tantrum declared that Tiktok was a national security threat, yet apparently not really, because he let the so-called threat continue operating with zero restriction.  And his criteria for resolution was for China to sell significant Tiktok stake to a rich family who funded his election campaign.  Forcing a sale isn't a fix for something claimed to be a security threat."

Joe Biden has so much character he helped his brother Frank dodge a million dollar negligent homicide judgment.

so much ethics: 

>President Joe Biden said at the start of his administration that family conflicts of interest would not be tolerated in his White House, but not two weeks into his presidency, his brother's actions as a part of his employment at a law firm in Florida are raising questions about how he'll implement that pledge.
Francis ""Frank"" Biden, the President's brother, was hired as a non-attorney, senior adviser for Berman Law Group, a Boca Raton law firm in 2018. The firm frequently touts Frank Biden's ties to the President, featuring Frank and his family connections prominently on their website, in ads and on social media.
As Frank Biden was with his brother in Washington for the inauguration last month, the firm placed a two-page ""advertorial"" in a local Florida newspaper emphasizing the shared values between ""the two Biden brothers."" With Frank Biden's image placed prominently in the center of the ad, it also mentioned the firm's lawsuit against sugar cane growers ""filed against the backdrop of incoming President Joseph Biden Jr.'s commitment to environmental and social justice(.)""

AMD is primarily a chip designer and there a significantly better apples to apples comparison. Both companies are American.

Years ago I bought Ford as a value play, back then it appeared undervalued and had a solid dividend for the sector. I feel like Fords F-150 alone is enough to justify owning the stock. Then the pandemic happened, then the chip shortage happened and I have remained patient. 

Now that patience has been rewarded, I keep looking at TSLA and F and wonder why they don't get together. With Ford's diverse product lineup, aggressive move into the EV market and projections of profitability, I think they represent a significant value. I know they are hampered by huge legacy costs, but in todays inflationary environment, I believe those costs are mitigated.  

TSLA is losing market share and their shiny new offering (the cybertruck) is still a long way off. Yet TSLA still has nearly 10x the market cap of Ford. This makes me wonder if TSLA would look to pick off a potential competitor in the EV market, expand their products offerings and create a big splash all at once."

1. Having money to start and add for faster gains.
2. Short term capital gains tax
3. Time waiting for drops in stock to rise again.
4. Is there a limit on trade frequency through broker?

Even with the above limits(except 4), if you buy low, sell high with your investments spread over a few volatile stocks I would think you could become rich in no time. What am I missing that is limiting this?

Also why do people say you can lose your entire investment in a stock? Isn’t that only if you sell low(solution: don’t sell, just wait for it to rise) or the company goes bankrupt/goes out of business?

Think about it this way, if your original cost basis gets increased because of a wash sale, when you eventually sell you either claim less total gains, or a larger loss which are both beneficial for your taxes.

2. Invest in established, resilient companies.

Sure. AMC could have shut down after 100 years of being in business. It wasn't a breathtakingly unrealistic call that this business would be able to rebound after a year that was hard on all movie theaters. AMC survived the Great Depression and WWII. How crazy anyone thought it'd survive covid.

Its not that simple to buy when everybody is selling, how'd that work out for Hertz and Chesapeake last year? Luckin Coffee? Are you gonna be rebuying AMC when everyone is selling a week or month from now and its sitting in the teens/single digits again? 

I buy businesses that everybody is selling when I believe in the long term vision of the company. AMC/GME do not fall into that category."

I also wouldn't say every sector is overvalued. Financials are still cheap, energy is mostly cheap but with a lot of zombie companies, precious metal miners are cheap, a lot of healthcare stocks are reasonably priced. The issue the market has is we simultaneously have tech stocks that are trading at ridiculously high earnings AND those earnings occurred in a best case tech scenario while also having companies that had significant temporary disruption from Covid that had earnings collapses which should grow into their high multiples. So, if I had to guess we will see poor tech earnings growth due to the Covid artifical earnings accelation ending followed by a tech PE collapse, and we will have a lot of re-opening industries perform well and grow into their PE."

2021-06-04 01:26:23,stocks,"There are many untold or unloved stocks that are appeared fairly valued or at least not overvalued. They are just not in the spotlight of media.

Advice to you

1. I do like to caution you to dig through the qualitative aspects first before commenting valuations. A company can be undervalued at 30x P/E, but another can be way overvalued, as their prospect and financial performance are vastly different.
2. Give yourself at least 6 months of searches. Don't rush. If you do, you would end up joining both love'wagon or/and hate'wagon driven by greed and fear in the market. Then, you are not investing, as you are simply following the trends.
   1. All the researches end up being helpful to the next research, thereby speeding up my research progress. For example, I look into engineering software industry and companies earlier this year, no target was found. But this research helps me to tackle the business directions on Unity Technologies, the game engine company which wants to expand to that industry. 
3. If you want to get a quick valuation screening across all names, you can use a stock screener to tackle the undervalued or cheaper names then dig their business from there. I use investing.com, but there are plenty of other options for free in the internet."

The market is looking for a correction which will trouble every stock. most people are waiting for this correction before going long. However if you can't stand aside for now, I will suggest you look at paying dividend stocks to invest in, such that even if they go down, you are guaranteed of a pay out at least twice a year. I also think that stocks that are involved in shelter and food will always do well since people need houses and food to stay alive. Is also good to look at stock from a long term perspective."

If I have a basket of 3 stocks, PE is 20, 30, and 40 you could say the 40 is overvalued. If I have a basket with PE 200, 210, 250 you could say 250 is overvalued.

If every sector had their PE's doubled, the lowest PE in that sector is still the lowest value relative to the basket you're doing the comparison, likewise the highest one is still overvalued in the basket.

2021-06-03 20:56:15,stocks,"Because think about which stocks disproportionately account for the value of the S&P500. Tech companies which are at least 30% of the s&p500 weight, and more when you consider companies like Amazon or Netlfix aren't technically classified as tech but essentially are. Other foreign markets aren't as tech heavy as the US. Their markets are more heavily financials, cyclicals, and energy which got crushed during the pandemic. Tech companies, however, mostly benefited from the pandemic. And yes low interest rates help explain some of the high multiples because fast growing tech companies can benefit from cheap debt while financials get significantly hurt by low rates, but my point is low rates by themselves aren't an adequate explanation. 

Also, the US has had very aggressive fiscal spending while other countries have been more aggressive with their monetary policy. I wouldn't be surprised if the massive fiscal spending by the US government found its way into equities. How many people used their stimulus checks to buy stocks?"

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/csushpinsa](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/csushpinsa)

That's a 105 pt increase and would sound like a lot if we just kept looking at it as a 105/133 increase or 238/133 being 78%

* 78% over 9 years is 8.6% when we do the simple math.
* Compounded annually, it's 6.4%

As such, if you took $133 and bought Nasdaq or the S&P 500 you'd wind up with $568 and $350 respectively (going until 2020)

[https://financial-calculators.com/historical-investment-calculator](https://financial-calculators.com/historical-investment-calculator)

But that's why I make the assertion of ""2% according to official government statistics"" as we know that a cell phone or vehicle purchased 7-8 years ago is not going for anything close to that value today.  

Point is, inflation is real but people shouldn't be worried about losing too much to it when the risk is greater to an economic downturn.

2021-06-03 23:30:12,stocks,"Basically, the volume and liquidity is driven because of writing and buying of option contracts. 

Mm are biggies and they are the one who sell options and make a lot of money 
And there are xyz bunch of buyers of that particular option and vice versa. 
Great explaination!"
2021-06-03 22:24:17,stocks,"So then you’re saying the market makers could potentially be stuck with options if nobody buys off them? So due to this, is there any way they could manipulate stock prices by offering specific bid or ask prices in order to cheat a share price either above or below a strike price? In such a way that would benefit them? Because i have noticed that on exp days the share prices tend to get wild. It almost seems like somehow someway the stock price ends up in a place that benefits nobody!"
2021-06-03 20:03:36,stocks,"Right? So much good info in here. I think to be very technical about it, pre ends 2 minutes till, and post starts 2 minutes after.

Those smart dudes that posted, they know what’s up though. Thanks gents!"

I was referring to the fact the market is open 16 hours a day and it’s extremely difficult to keep up with as a retail investor especially with a day job.

2021-06-03 20:09:39,stocks,"Completely agree. It's almost comical to watch people frantically trade up and down left and right to snag a measly 10 or 15% while I'm sitting back relaxing getting pretty much the same percentage without having to do a single thing to my portfolio. 

Options and all that seem like 10x the work for seemingly zero benefit.

It's like the people who take 37 side streets in order to avoid the traffic on the freeway So that they can arrive to work pretty much the same time I do. Except I got to chill in my car and listen to a podcast while I rolled along at a steady 13 mph letting the cars around me do the stop and go thing."
2021-06-04 05:13:07,stocks,Pardon?
2021-06-03 20:01:03,stocks,Liquidity is the amount of a security/derivative available to be bought and sold. The higher the liquidity the more shares are being traded and the more accurate the price is. When you lose liquidity the spread becomes wider. Then when everyone tries to sell at the same time because of a real world event there might be no one to buy at all which means the price drops until someone steps in to buy it. Basically the more liquid a market the less volatile it will be.
2021-06-03 21:59:26,stocks,"> The difference obviously is that you cannot list or trade the same option on multiple exchanges

2021-06-04 14:12:00,stocks,"I presume there is something in the American laws or CBOE rules that says options can be redeemed at any time.  

Even if there isn't, European markets open when American markets are closed, so if someone wants to exercise their option and you sold an uncovered option, you would have big liquidity problems and spread issues fulfilling the option OTC unless you also have access to another European exchange where the stock is being traded. So I suppose it's simplest to close down all option fulfillment during down hours rather than provide liquidity for every single option."

Oil prices are higher now than when investors started hating the Anadarko deal... the stock was $45 then and now is $29. Has recovered from a low of $10. But still upside. Carl Icahn is invested in it. 

Pre-Anadarko the stock was as high as $80. It's a highly levered company so it moves with oil prices. Bet on continued global recovery and supply tightness. Capex into oil expansion was very low during the pandemic and opec has more discipline than in recent years.

Not a bet without risk, but could be another 50% there.

2021-06-04 06:08:10,stocks,"Until yesterday, SENSE ONICS.  They have a sensor that's (allegedly) revolutionary for diabetes monitoring.  My guess is that diabetes will continue to be a growth industry.  The two main existing diabetes gadgets have been killing it, but you can't get in on the ground floor of those without going back in time.  Sense onics could be the next big one.  Or not.

ZOOmedica.  They just launched a device for veterinarians that is basically like a countertop inkjet printer but it runs tests medical tests on cats and dogs.  It uses some presumably overpriced cartridges that the vet will buy and charge the pet owners for.  It lets the vet run the tests promptly in-house rather than send them out.  It may be overpriced for what it is, but doctors and customers will probably pay for this incremental convenience the way we all flipped to buying individual coffee pods at 15x the old price of a cup.  Pet ownership has exploded, pet owners will pay anything for dear Fluffy, and vet offices are gold mines.  It's not without drawbacks, but this might take off. 

ADBE.  Everyone talks about various sexy software companies from Microsoft to gaming to every SaaS out there.  Adobe is rarely mentioned, but it's essential software for every single business person or company, and they've begun leaning into their software subscription monopoly.

2021-06-04 08:08:28,stocks,"Came to this thread for ideas to add to my watchlist. Then I read this post which revalidates my group think. :)

I got into MAXN after the split with SPWR. I was holding SPWR, and ended up with shares of MAXN because of the split. When it first split, it started trading at around $20. Then over the next month it slid all the way to $13. I think this slide was the market coming to terms with the polysilicon contract you stated.

Then after that, MAXN went on a tear, climbing from $13 in September to a high of $50 in January during the clean energy hype. During this entire time, nothing about the fundamentals changed.

The big thing about MAXN is its origins. Back in the past, SPWR made its own solar panels and also installed them. SPWR split so that it could separate the margins from its two businesses. Now SPWR competes directly with companies like RUN and MAXN competes directly with companies like SEDG.

The reason I love MAXN right now, despite its headwinds, is the P/S ratio. MAXN has a high quality solar panel. According to this website, the SEDG and MAXN solar panels are very comparable in cost per watt: https://www.solarquotes.com.au/panels/comparison/compare-solar-panels/

Despite all this, the P/S ratio of MAXN is  0.86 as I believe investors are scared of the inflationary margin pressures. SEDG operates at a P/S of 8. The bear case here is that CSIQ and JKS (both panel manufacturers) also operate at P/S levels comparable to MAXN. So what really makes MAXN different?

Like said above, I think if you believe in the company leadership, a change in their contract at the end of 2022 will see a sharp increase in margin and profitability. This is still a risky play, but given that MAXN just did an offering at $18 to raise capital gives me hope that they can weather the storm until 2022 when things can turn around."

When I invest in companies like recaf it's a bet that they find oil, so shorting is just my opportunity to add more on the dip. Recaf especially as they now have 2 successful finds as of yesterday. We should see the 2d results by September along with well3. More results on well2 will be coming out this month and the sp will continue to climb since the first core is already showing 440ft of a working petroleum system.  This means the current basin they are exploring is at least 15km long with a depth of 200meters or more. 
Another factor is if u check the short intrest it's always increased around the estimated time for results and then drops a month after results came out.

To begin with you can roll with your own logging thing, then when you need something better you can use your cloud providers loggers. AWS CloudWatch, Google's cloud logging service, Azure's logging service. Then if that's not enough and you need something really powerful you go to specialist providers. Quite niche in my view. And again there are so many to chose from. Listed and even more unlisted companies. At the end of the say, not to trivialise it, but cloud logging services are just storing text files on cloud servers and having good search and dashboading facilities. I don't want to be simplistic but if you look at the core of it that's what it is. So not much moat either is what I'm trying to say. Assuming most logging providers have roughly the same tech how do you compete? By pushing price lower and lower per GB? How do you keep customers from switching?

In short they're equities a market maker (think banks) create for trading that represent a certain number of shares in a foreign company, but they're not actually foreign shares. The ratio of ADSes to the foreign equity can be anything (mine is 2:1 so each ADS is worth 1/2 a foreign share).

They have 3 levels, but I don't recall all the differences, just that they can be sponsored (made with the permission & involvement of the foreign company) or unsponsored.

Since ADRs handle foreign tax payments (which are generally fully deductible from taxes without itemizing) and currency conversions for any dividends I prefer them. They also tend to be more liquid and have higher disclosure requirements.

In this case the ADR appears to be much LESS liquid and I don't know why. It may be the case that your broker charges additional fees for foreign ordinaries and if so I'd probably stay away entirely.

Firstly, I think the amount of competition proves that it's not ""niche"" -- it's just as niche as saying ""my system stack needs a database"". In 2021, centralized logging and metric tracking is the standard for any stack. 

Secondly, and the main point: The basis of working with data of any sort is making meaningful sense of the data. You can store all the log files you want, but if you cannot parse, count, and make a meaningful story out of it: it's useless. I have to say I think you're simplifying it a bit too much. Sumo also handles system metrics , not just logs (although again, there is a lot of competition)   
I work in devops and can attest Sumo is an amazing utility. It's a lot more than ""storing text files"" (however my company doesn't use it due to cost).  


You used something like cloudwatch as an example. If you've ever actually tried to ship all your syslog, app logs, container logs, web server logs, system metrics, lambda output, etc etc to Cloudwatch logs and make any sense of them you'd realize it's VERY painful to work with, then you have to use something like Athena to make sense of them -- extremely costly and no dashboarding/trend logic/etc.   


Using something like ELK requires staff manpower, skillsets, and compute/storage resources to manage the complex ELK stack.  Not to mention creating the dashboards and analytic outputs is done in-house, by hand without vendor support. Papertrail doesn't give insights/dashboards or analytics.   


Sumo is cheaper and boasts being more lightweight/easier than Splunk.   


etc etc etc. I could keep talking on this topic but I'll stop here.   


**TL;DR: As a devops/sysadmin/sre, I think it's naive to think centralized monitoring/alerting/log parsing is niche or an unprofitable industry.**"

2021-06-04 15:42:28,stocks,If you say so. Retail is the last dog to the bowl.
2021-06-04 03:11:29,stocks,It will cause over valued stocks to correct. Significantly.
2021-06-04 06:18:35,stocks,"I know you already said that, but why do you think that?"
2021-06-04 07:29:43,stocks,"Higher Inflation = prices for products go up. Countries tend to combat this with higher interest rates. The USA in particular tends to throw money at their problems, as such the FED is trying to keep interest rates low. I do not think they will succeed. I think within the next year interest rates will increase significantly. And various big hedgies agree (Burry, Dalio, Buffet)

Higher interest rates = borrowing is more expensive. Means Tesla pay more for the loans they need to generate growth (all those big factories they dont have yet need) 

Higher cost of borrowing = prices for products going up to help generate revenue to cover their borrowing.

This has a knock on effect to growth stocks because of these factors, stocks decrease in value. Tesla/NVDA will be borrowing more at an expensive rate to keep the growth going. While their growth in terms of revenue is excellent, they aren't currently worth 600$ using DCF analysis. 

Retail will be left holding the bag, even if its just 100$ down, it is still significant. And the professional investors will be reaping their annual 30% + annual returns."
2021-06-04 19:42:34,stocks,"I appreciate the response! I've always had the impression investing in stocks was to HEDGE against inflation, buying companies for long term growth due to year to year inflation.

2021-06-03 20:10:52,stocks,"Your point is perfectly valid and the right counter DD to the short squeeze thesis in a world in which their short position is coverable. The fact that they are leveraged to the tits + doubling down after the January run up locked them into an uncoverable position. They do not and will never have the cash in hand to cover because they are extremely leveraged. Even if they tried to close out all their currently profitable positions, their portfolios are so large that it would cause massive losses in those positions which would lower their margin equity by a huge amount and speed up the forced liquidation on their short positions"
2021-06-04 04:57:18,stocks,"Hold, as always. One 100% day feels like a trap imo. Maybe it’s too hyped I don’t know"
2021-06-04 10:37:42,stocks,No i have not ill have to look that up!
2021-06-04 06:32:49,stocks,"So they would not be allowed to hedge their positions? Then you would force market makers to take less intitial risk because they cant hedge. That would mean that volatility and bid ask spreads would increase, hurting every market partitioner"
2021-06-04 14:50:03,stocks,"Why? If they believe it will fall again, why cover and realize the loss, rather than wait for it to fall? I mean even a billion is 4% of the total market cap. If they were short every single share of AMC in existence (which is highly unlikely) then they would be down roughly 5%. That's more painful but still not fucked. Might as well ride it out, they know the price will decrease."

2021-06-04 06:42:36,stocks,Theres a difference between heading a position and doing what they do
2021-06-04 06:47:53,stocks,Because you know what happens day to day within the balance sheet of a market maker. They have billions of transactions on a normal day affecting the exposure the market maker has so disbalances happen all the time. I doubt criminally illegal things happen in the operations
2021-06-03 22:18:16,stocks,"I've been curious about this for a while now, currently holding GME and movie stock, and almost pulled it yesterday but decided to hodl. Not sure if it's in my best interest to sell movies asap, or buy the dip on popcorn. 

Is the rug pull the end of the movie, in your opinion, or the pinch 2 before the climax, along with GME?"
2021-06-03 23:26:01,stocks,wrong silhouette - crypto rug pull not movies.  still momentum in movies.  Musk just started the tanking tonight and jpow will continue it tomorrow.  weekend will be a bloodbath.

2021-06-03 20:38:17,stocks,"Ya, honestly. So what is the upside to a trade like that? Net $0? Why take any position at all if the end game is to remain neutral? Fucking clowns are everywhere."
2021-06-04 05:22:15,stocks,"Movie stock has been offered as a viable “meme” stock since about December.  GameStop was the most heavily short stock six months prior to that, if you ask me, movie stock is being offered up as a distraction to give short hedge funds a relief from GME.  It may be shorted as well but nooooo where near as much as GME.  It’s the lesser of two evils for them and they can manage it way better than GME.  If this weren’t true they wouldn’t be hiring every single youtuber, twitterer and celebrity they can find to sponsor and evangelize it so hard as they have been for months.

When someone offers you a product so hard like that over the other one that historically has performed way better, you have to ask yourself “why is that?..”

The price of the stock alone tells you multitudes about the supply and demand available.  There’s a very good reason that GME is worth $280 a share now while the other is less than 1/6th comparatively.

Sadly, for too many they will realize too late (during moass) that dollar for dollar, compared to GME, the movie stock was not a good squeeze investment in the long run."
2021-06-04 05:13:58,stocks,"If you think Musk is behind the crypto dumps then you are falling for the ruse.  Hedge funds bought into almost every major crypto out there and they wait for Elon to open his mouth so they can justify further tanking it!  It’s what they do, they hide behind bad news/good news to pump and dump."
2021-06-04 01:21:32,stocks,"No, just brother."
2021-06-04 02:11:03,stocks,And the other claim is saying that its a grand conspiracy of fraud and deceit with firms breaking every rule in the book. The gme and amc longs are a cult like group finding ways to fuel their confirmation bias
2021-06-04 07:02:40,stocks,"Wanna make a bet that nothing will happen? A big hedge fund (+20 billion) wont fall, a market maker wont fall and wont be fined by the sec for unfair practises.

You call me innocent due to believing that no big frauds are happening in the most regulated sector. And not believing that guys in college formulating DD during their lunch breaks have found a major fraud"

First of they actually do commit fraud and get caught all the time, but they are fined pennies compared to the amount they make off that same crime. Its a joke."
2021-06-03 20:25:51,stocks,"Generally speaking, if you don’t have the money, your broker will try to force you to sell before expiry. And you should sell anyways, it’s much more consistent and the option has much more extrinsic value 1 hour before expiry compared to 1 minute.

If you’re using a margin account, which most options accounts are, you can borrow up to your initial investment (doubling your money) to buy things, and that can go for exercising the option as well."

2021-06-04 11:12:37,stocks,"I need info on why there is no volume with VRM!? High ratings, nice last qtr, and high demand! Why..."
2021-06-04 18:52:40,stocks,">I don't think so, and I think the market reflects my uncertainty. First, Moderna’s main competitor (Pfizer) has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two.

If you don't look at Pfizer, but at where they get their vaccin from, you see the same bubble is forming for Biontech, which uses the same technology.

I don't know what these companies should be worth, but the technology is kind of a big deal. It marks the transition from a century of small molecule medicines to big ones. Add to that a free trial with seemingly very few side effects on all those millions if not billions of people that get the vaccin. This basically skips a decade of painful trials and approvals."
2021-06-04 10:45:26,stocks,"Is the price (relatively speaking) expected to dip after the split? What I’m asking is, would it be better to open a position now or post-split?"
2021-06-04 10:53:55,stocks,"Depends on the price of NVDA on market close the day before. It just hit $700 as I type this, and has been having regular +$20 moves every three days. At this rate, low $750 to $800 pre-split. 

Say it hits $800 market close. On split day, it’ll be readjusted at $200. 

Personally for me, I’d jump on NVDA at anytime and just dollar cost average into it. I love the company and stock. You could buy a single share or two now, and see it split into 4 apiece. Doing so could also see some good short term growth as well. 

You could also wait for the split, and buy more at a lower price. The only question is that once it splits, lots of retail will buy at the lower price and could see immediate jump on price. Or cool off, and dip $50 (and if it does dip, I’d be buying a ton more)."

/u/Atobitt may be correct, and if he is more power to him. But don't confuse 'Research' with you blindly putting your faith in a profit (prophet, get it?)."
2021-06-04 10:02:33,stocks,It's not just some guy. Several prominent people in the community have made research. Said research have been peer-reviewed by professionals.

When you post a comment like:
> If u done any research, u would know the real short interest is alot higher than 24%.

Only to follow up with:
> R/superstonk 


That is proselytizing pure and simple. You don't have anymore answers than anyone else and you are just trying to get people to join your Religion."

I know it sounds like conspiracy ramblings, but so did Michael Burry when he actually looked at the mortgage data. The information was there, he just took the time to look at it.

In the linked paper by the meme-stock moderator, pages 16-26 are a compilation of FINRA short selling violations. The most egregious example cites failure to mark millions of shares as “short” over a period of 4 years. The fine was negligible. 

I know it sounds crazy, but I’m convinced that FINRA is either asleep at the wheel, or they are complicit in this naked shorting hypothesis. Nobody wanted to believe the rating agencies were basically selling AAA ratings, and yet they were. 

Don’t mistake the ferver and immaturity of some of the self-proclaimed “apes” as stupidity. We are all having a good time, but not all of us are simply “YOLOing” it. Some of the DD is a little out there, but overall, I firmly believe we’re about to see the collapse of the house of cards that is our market."
2021-06-04 07:40:29,stocks,"FINRA didn't let Melvin just zero a number to duck brickbats. And they've given out multi-million dollar fines for minor clerical errors in short interest reporting.

There is 0 evidence that the short numbers for the meme stocks are fraudulent.

Short selling is not going to collapse anything. The situation is nothing like 2007, when major banks were leveraged to the gills on trillions of dollars in mortgage derivatives.

The only thing that's likely to crash is the popularity of meme trading. And that will only hurt the muppets who were suckered into it."
2021-06-04 18:20:11,stocks,"Is there a benefit to vote this in as a shareholder? It says it only goes thru if closing market price is above 360, also they can extend the offer if it hasn't hit that threshold.

2021-06-04 02:50:16,stocks,All I currently see is lots of downward pressure. Apparently its hard for retailers to persistently move a valuation to over 30B USD. This is also what we saw with GME. Thats why I would recommend to sell or keep positions. But certainly you wont see massive gains any longer from this point on.

2021-06-03 21:15:32,stocks,Okay I figured. Why is it spelt that way though Baha? I know this is some superstonks terminology I just don't totally get it
2021-06-04 02:07:07,stocks,"Thanks for the clarification.  

* Corrections typically happen every 10-12 years.  We're sitting on some weird outlier currently but it's been the average cycle for decades.
* Don't get caught up in the dividends trade.  It's nice, and the follow-up of ""what if I buy a stock for the dividends, and sell it"" comes up as well.  
* Dividends can be treated as income, and as you grow in your tax bracket, it's going to be taxed at some inopportune numbers.  
* You probably need income later in life (when you have reduced earnings potential due to infirmity or skill-set aging) versus now.  You should be looking for growth opportunities now when you can find them.  

Fast forward 10-15 years :)

* Don't do bonds.  Look at the rates now and see the 10yr at 1.60%, though you'll get your interest rate locked in and a principle returned, it's seriously lagging (who the heck wants a 1.6% rate unless they're forced to?)
* Avoid the ""laddering of CDs"" which is much like the above.  It reduces your liquidity and ability to use that money when you want/need
* Continue to go after equities.  You can easily get 2% but your rate of return after 10 years w/ VTI is something like 10-14% when you re-invest the dividends.  
* Selling the equity puts you in the best tax-advantaged position of long-term capital gains.  You may not get the depreciation from real-estate but ...
* Liquidity will remain king for many years after that.  Meme stock?  New EV?  Vacay to mars?  War because of the AI on the moon takes over?  You can invest, move and buy when it strikes your fancy.

Anyhow, check out obvious compound interest calculators and things like this: [https://financial-calculators.com/historical-investment-calculator](https://financial-calculators.com/historical-investment-calculator) to help figure out what are decent index based investment vehicles.  

But dividends when 30?  Your brain is young enough to absorb how to invest in the market, and realize that your financial knowledge will peak when you're \~55-57 so definitely, plan ahead!"

2021-06-03 20:51:38,stocks,I have 400 shares with TD Ameritrade and they have totally screwed me. First I was not aware of the delisting until after it happened and TDA did not email me about it. Then for months they gave me misleading information and in the end they will not do anything. I can't sell or convert to HK. I should of received a dividend yesterday. Now TD says they are not paying the dividend. What brokerage firm are your CHL shares with?

2021-06-04 19:46:54,stocks,"Really sorry to hear all this. People on the Reddit forums make fun of Vanguard’s website, but the most important thing to me is that I have no horror story about them and neither does anyone else I know who uses them."
2021-06-04 19:59:55,stocks,"I called TD and was informed by customer service that the dividend would not be paid due to the executive order. I then called Bank of New York (the administrator of the ADR) who informed me the dividend was paid and TD received it. I called TD again and after literally 2 hours on hold, I managed to speak to the corporate actions department. They said the dividend payment would take a couple weeks to disburse due to “administrative accounting “. This is nonsense. Dividends are to be paid on the payable date. Anything later is illegal withholding. I find the unprofessional service and often contradictory advice from TD appalling."
2021-06-04 00:00:57,stocks,"Your job actually sounds really interesting.  Do you enjoy it?

More related to this post, I recently opened up an account with a robo advisor brokerage, but heard about two other robo advisor brokerages/banks that sound appealing for other reasons.  Would it be weird if I opened up so many brokerage/bank accounts in one year and regularly send, say, several thousands from my bank account to various brokerages?  This is a weirdly specific question, but it's something that's crossed my mind, so I figured I'd take the opportunity to ask!"
