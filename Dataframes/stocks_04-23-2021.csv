2021-04-23 19:26:32,stocks,"I think we saw the sell off, though if there is an official proposal then I think we could see another, bigger dip. But any plan has to pass the Senate which at this point I would consider extremely unlikely. At best maybe a small increase, but I don't see anything past even 25%"
2021-04-23 19:42:38,stocks,"Oh snap its about to get political up in here. Grab the popcorn.

No but seriously I think you are correct. Start high negotiate down. 30% is obscene, so make it less obscene in comparison by starting at an absurdly obscene increase and then wiggle your way down so 30 sounds reasonable."
2021-04-23 19:23:05,stocks,Yes and yes
2021-04-23 19:37:16,stocks,"I think he knows it won't get passed so tried to go high to leave room to negotiate with, so even if the increase is a lot lower he will get an increase. Feel this may end up in tge high 20s."
2021-04-23 19:48:04,stocks,They most likely settle at 25%. No way itll go above 30.
2021-04-23 19:19:14,stocks,I think the sell off already happened. I doubt they will be able to pass it at the 39.6. Possibly a lower number.
2021-04-23 19:54:43,stocks,"I feel like a lot of people on here don‚Äôt understand tax brackets. You‚Äôre only taxed 40% on earnings over the first million. A flat tax rate hurts poor people more since that little amount of money means more to them. 


Just be like me. Live in a tax haven with no tax :) mind you our govt has stated they want to try putting in a cap gins tax to help fund their debt but fuck that no one would pay it."
2021-04-23 19:25:36,stocks,All I can say is that it's really unfair to be anywhere near 40%. With the aha surcharge this pushes close to 50% and after state tax in some states it is over 50%. That's a joke.

2021-04-23 19:28:25,stocks,We need a flat tax.  Making the rich poorer does not make the poor richer
2021-04-23 19:53:30,stocks,Isn‚Äôt it already at 25%?
2021-04-23 19:54:22,stocks,If you make $1 million plus a year and only from capital gains.
2021-04-23 19:51:58,stocks,You think OP makes $1 million + a year?
2021-04-23 19:53:09,stocks,Who wants to hurt every aspect of the US?
2021-04-23 19:44:54,stocks,I agree. Look at the past year. This has to be intentional
2021-04-23 19:40:23,stocks,lol...good luck making so much of the population understand that...I've given up that fight...
2021-04-23 19:32:09,stocks,Yup.  But we live in a society of jealousy. People want to penalize rich people for being successful.
2021-04-23 19:59:26,stocks,"It's 20%.

Some form of raise is likely but not what was seen, and it's not just Manchin or other ""moderate"" dems that's going to be blocking it."
2021-04-23 19:58:40,stocks,"Still tell me how that's fair? I love the mentality of ""well that doesn't effect me,  so go ahead and tax them."" Do you think it's fair that they put their money at risk of loss to invest in the market for the government to take more of the profits than they get, when the government put nothing at risk?"

2021-04-23 19:22:17,stocks,Why has it fallen so much YTD?
2021-04-23 19:03:23,stocks,When are they announcing earnings? Not finding the date anywhere
2021-04-23 18:57:07,stocks,I‚Äôm asking because I bet you know more than me. What‚Äôs the deal with the war on RKT pro. Was it wise to force an ultimatum on the mortgage broker community? Will it have an adverse effect on earnings? I‚Äôm long RKT with 100+ shares but I also like UWMC and saw them as undervalued before all the recent drama. Any thoughts I the impact of the cross town rival beef?
2021-04-23 18:54:49,stocks,This thing is worth so much more than its current price. So much more...not sure why witubgiod revenue ans growth the market keeps it in the single digits.
2021-04-23 19:05:38,stocks,I hope so I'm seeing earning pushed back to June on some sites
2021-04-23 19:35:10,stocks,"The rise in the 10 year yield means mortgage rates will rise, which means less refinancing. The market equates RKT and UWMC with refinancing but UWMC makes most of their money on primary mortgage origination so the market has it wrong. 

Earnings will blow past expectations and we‚Äôll see $12 again really soon."
2021-04-23 19:50:51,stocks,"Because I bought it....  Yours Sincerely, A. Baghldr"
2021-04-23 19:09:30,stocks,Supposed to be before may 10th
2021-04-23 19:10:00,stocks,1st or 2nd week of may
2021-04-23 19:08:43,stocks,"Similar to you, I have looked at both but I ultimately settled on UWMC. I went out my way not to talk about RKT because every company should stand on its own merit."
2021-04-23 19:58:37,stocks,"It was very wise. I work with brokers daily and this push is what they needed to know UWMC is in their corner. Rocket is a bad bad word in the industry due to their predatory practices. They steal business from brokers all the time. Not to mention UWMC helps them close loans with a two week turnaround versus over 30 days throughout the industry. They also have lower rates. When they are an option, they are the easy choice."
2021-04-23 19:17:20,stocks,"In my personal opinion, yes it was wise. I'm going to show you two advertisements:

 [Certain Is Better | Tracy Morgan, Dave Bautista & Liza Koshy | Rocket Mortgage Super Bowl Commercial - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMgA-y2nRWE) 

This is Rocket's ad. Notice at the end the actor is pointing to the phone with rocket being advertised?

Now this is UWMC's ad:

 [Big Game Spot | FindAMortgageBroker.com - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1xBt7Nch7Y) 

Notice something unusual? UWM isn't directly advertising themselves. They're advertising [FindAMortgageBroker.com](https://FindAMortgageBroker.com). 

Everybody wants to cut the mortgage broker out but UWM. Although Rocket is making the better business decision, going direct to the consumer, UWM is essentially get an entire retail arm commission only. Not only does it show extremely good moral but when the refi boom is over I personally thing Rocket is going to get a lot less market share than UWM.

Any mortgage broker with a brain should be realizing based on the two advertisements that UWM is the only person NOT trying to cut them out.

Additionally UWM's tech is much more to brag about based on interviews with brokers/ customers I've done. Lower rates. Much, much faster times.

RKT also has a very, very concerning statement deep in one of their filings. It's 751 pages and I'm not going to go look for it again. Essentially what it's saying is RKT does NOT want investors to devalue their tax assets, meaning losses they've carried over the years to reduce tax burden, and instead of paying taxes they're basically going to pay the CEO millions and/or billions per year in lieu of taxes. This is going to be a drag on their earnings for years.

UWM has a similar statement but it's not quite is much when talked about relative to the earnings.

Rocket is going to look like a lot worse of an investment when the refi boom is over."
2021-04-23 19:04:06,stocks,Every coke needs a pepsi and the market is big enough for both! This is going to be record low rates for this year and that means all related organizations will do well!
2021-04-23 19:02:13,stocks,It's new and ppl looking at it for different reasons. We need get the word out that its a great yield in a growth industry for 2021. Definitely alot of potential for this year.
2021-04-23 19:10:32,stocks,Oh? I saw a reply from IR where they stated they must release prior to may 10th. We have been looking at May 5 as the expected date.
2021-04-23 18:50:55,stocks,"robinhood does not have fee free trades, you just arent aware of how they are scalping your purchase orders.

this hits point 1 and 4.

3 is a winner for sure, their app is the best by far.

2? Am not experienced enough here.


The lack of ability to get a person on the phone, the consistent crashing issues that cause significant losses are issues you will not have with fidelity/schwab/vanguard. so I guess the issue is more- do i want a pretty app or a functional brokerage service?"
2021-04-23 18:48:14,stocks,first of all nothing on robinhood is free. i‚Äôll type up a real reason to switch as soon as i can put it together
2021-04-23 18:49:35,stocks,"Only reason you need, they just recently costed me thousands of dollars by disabling my trade ability when a particular investments was mooning. If this sounds all to familiar it is because this has happened to you and many of us apes on RH before with GME, just this time it was something new they decided to fuck me on.

2021-04-23 18:54:49,stocks,Robinhood steals from the poor
2021-04-23 18:43:52,stocks,I think a lot of the backing for leaving robinhood comes from their history of the app crashing during very volatile times.

I love both. Did they drop the ball yes they did."
2021-04-23 19:09:05,stocks,"Robinhood has the best trading mobile app.

So far AAPL has returned you some 45%. What stock has the LT history, marketshare, and name recognition that AAPL has that you think will be a better parking spot for your cash? 

You need to have an answer to that question before you sell. Even if your answer is ""imma get hella weed & blow and pimp my ride like its 1999"" thats fine, its your money. But if you're like, just going to sit on cash, leave it where it is.

I lost a ton of money back in 2016 on crypto, thought I was done forever and I barely remember it. As you make more money, the small amounts you have in the market from being younger mean less and less and you will have wished you got into what you‚Äôre talking about wanting to get into because most likely in 5 years Tesla will be at least double what it is now. Best of luck!"
2021-04-23 19:56:05,stocks,Totally understandable when I think less risk I don't necessarily think QQQ but a little QQQ exposure probably wouldn't hurt especially if he was VTI heavy.
2021-04-23 19:29:10,stocks,"Let's agree to disagree, time in the market beats timing the market. Investing most of your money in reliable bets like VTI ensures you get a good ""compound interest"" effect early on, this snowballs as you grow older and will be a very good nest egg until you're well into your career. Gambling 10-20% of your money is fine, a 10 bagger still makes you rich and a few failures won't ruin you.




As for Tesla I don't buy hopium. I buy based on facts and the facts are Tesla is getting hit hard by every car maker out there (their only major source of income). They had first mover advantage but is now losing their dominance as other brands got serious, see their decline in Europe. Tesla don't make batteries, Panasonic does and Tesla licenses their tech, without Panasonic no Tesla batteries. This is a major bear-case. Solar? Other brands has competitive product at lower prices and already control most of the market. *Tesla has no own tech or product that is unique or cheaper/noticeably better then the competition*. Until then, they're just hype."

2021-04-23 18:59:47,stocks,Pretty sure the owners (shareholders) would not be on board with that. TSLA should figure out how to make money selling cars before they take one giant LEAP farther away.
2021-04-23 17:53:27,stocks,It would be the opposite - TSLA is saying that their car is only worth 0.1 BTC... That's the same as selling their cars at a discount for $5k. It would hurt TSLA not help BTC.
2021-04-23 17:47:17,stocks,It would probably have to be equivalent to the dollar amount it would cost.. otherwise it‚Äôs probably market manipulation
2021-04-23 18:29:30,stocks,Yes

2021-04-23 18:42:40,stocks,I don‚Äôt think there is that big of a market for TSLA... a move in BTC would mean that people were trying to buy like millions of TSLAs. I like where your head is at though haha

2021-04-23 17:48:07,stocks,I don't think so since that inception was in 1972 and he bought it in 1969
2021-04-23 19:59:07,stocks,I called Invesco and we can't tell if his shares are still there or not without his social so we won't know till Monday but the guy did tell me that the fund has ended up as Invesco Discovery Mid Cap Growth Fund. Initial investment was $500. How does that change things?
2021-04-23 17:06:37,stocks,BYD is a massive HK listed stock with $72bn USD market cap. The OTC pink is not their main listing. This was an investment that Buffett made 13 years ago ... his $232mm initial investment is now worth like $7bn.

2021-04-23 17:17:46,stocks,"ZCPRF. Complete scam company. Only invested because they went up a ridiculous amount. But I didn't take the time to check volume and other important factors.

My guess is that the owner sold stock to himself or a friend to artificially pump up the price and lure people in.

The phone number I called belongs to a different company, and they told me I was one of many people to call and ask about various ""mining companies.""

I lost 2,000. No worries. Big lesson learned."
2021-04-23 17:05:43,stocks,"Interesting. Thanks.

2021-04-23 18:05:26,stocks,Because they (many large European companies) don't care to go through the trouble and large expense of making quarterly SEC filings that are required to trade on the bigger US exchanges.
2021-04-23 17:08:16,stocks,Beats me.
2021-04-23 17:18:43,stocks,Pink sheets doesn‚Äôt mean bad it just means there are lower barriers to entry. There are a ton of restrictions on ADR especially China ADRs and they SEC is cracking down on reporting requirements. They‚Äôre super liquid and you can and should just buy local HK shares if you want to invest in them. Pinks in the US just need a single Market Maker to list so the requirements are close to nothing - it also trades under BYDDY

More seriously: Is there a quarterly breakdown of Volkswagen's 2020 battery electric vehicle sales?

I'd like to see the breakdown of 231,600 EVs and compare it to the just-released figure of 59,900 BEVs sold in Q1 2021.

For example, VW sold 33,600 BEVs in Q1 2020.

How many BEVs did they sell in Q2?

Q3?

Q4?"

2021-04-23 17:52:09,stocks,The general trend for tech is that unless they smash earnings/give great guidance the stocks unlikely to jump from it. I would expect a small drop or more flat trading.

I'm hopeful that this earnings call actually sees some gains in the stock price."
2021-04-23 15:58:56,stocks,Look at whatever the analyst consensus is. That is priced in. 50/50 whether they beat or not. Trying to second guess whether earnings will beat consensus or not is a fool‚Äôs game.

A slight caveat I could think of is SE and their apparent foray into Mexico (and soon Latin America) which could take some market share from them. However I have an equally large position in SE as well, and I don‚Äôt think SE will be able to immediately displace MELI in Latin America."

2021-04-23 15:39:09,stocks,"You diversify away idiosyncratic risk specific to that one company, but there‚Äôs still sector risk you need to deal with. So, yes, some diversification benefit, but not really what someone thinks of when they say ‚Äúbe diversified‚Äù."
2021-04-23 15:40:41,stocks,That‚Äôs micro diversification; diversifying within a sector.
2021-04-23 15:51:55,stocks,No.  This is why people saw 90% losses within 2 years after 1999.
2021-04-23 15:29:04,stocks,No
2021-04-23 16:21:23,stocks,"Think about your question. 

‚ÄúShould count as‚Äù... to who? The market has no opinions. Money doesn‚Äôt move based on terminology. It moves based on risk and reward."
2021-04-23 16:24:39,stocks,"Diversification preserves wealth. Concentration builds wealth.

25% of stocks are responsible for all the gains between 1983-2006, 2/5 stocks are money losing investments. Almost 1/5 stocks is a terrible investment (losing 75% or more). Only 6% significantly outperform the index. 

What does this mean? It‚Äôs hard to pick winners. So when you have one, let it run and add to it. Don‚Äôt rebalance and trim. Let your portfolio concentrate for you. I mean if you are seeking alpha and trying to beat the SP500, you don‚Äôt want your portfolio to replicate the Sp500, right? 

Read on Ray Dalio. He states that all you need to monitor downside risk is 15 uncorrelated assets."
2021-04-23 17:03:29,stocks,"Yes and no. There are different styles within tech. You could own Intel for example... low growth cash cows. You could own moderate growth but solid quality companies like Microsoft or apple. You could go uber speculative with small cap nosebleed growth.

I pretty much only do tech but I make sure I spread it out across styles and market cap."
2021-04-23 16:06:28,stocks,"Well yes and no. Diversification help alleviate two things. The fact that you can‚Äôt see the future (or don‚Äôt have enough knowledge and information to do so) and random negative events.

If you own just a single company you are exposed to company specific risks. If you hold 10 different companies that goes away, but if they are all tech/growth companies you are still exposed to risks affecting tech specifically. To make that go away you invest across sectors.

So if you own just one US tech company you are exposed to company specific risks, industry risks, sector risks, national risks, equity risks, and global economic risks. The more you diversify the fewer risks you are exposed to. In your example you will be limiting company and industry risks.

Increased diversification comes at the cost of upside potential, but limit uncertainty and increase the consistency of your returns. If you are confident that tech stocks will do better than any other assets, and you think you have the ability to predict this, going all in on tech will improve your returns if nothing unpredictable happens (and you are right) by picking robust businesses you can limit your risk, but you cannot eliminate it."
2021-04-23 15:36:27,stocks,Agreed. Diversifying is picking stocks across multiple sectors.

2021-04-23 14:51:11,stocks,"I think Costco is becoming more popular and will overtake Walmart down the road. Walmart also announced six store closures at least in Canada. 

Overall the sentiment is that Costco pays employees better, has better customer service and gives you better value. In my opinion I hope Walmart crashes and burns because from a moral standpoint and how they treat employees and pay them, as well as their lack of  employees to help when I‚Äôm in the store just makes me not wanna set foot in there in general.

In all seriousness though, despite not closing during the pandemic, there were other issues.  Lack of staff is just one.  Service centers were closed awhile, including vision, tle, the haircut place, and ours was trying out a restaurant that ended up tanking (you can blame covid all you want but those fools NEVER changed their fryer grease).  The supply chain got tore up from the floor up, and anyone in retail knows you can't sell an empty shelf, it's even worse when you simply don't have anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to put on it.  Check the back, why?  Yep, still echoes.  Hours of operation were reduced.  Occupancy limits were decreased (and tracked) during peak weekend shopping times.  NOBODY wants to use those self-checkouts with a $300 cart of groceries.  Black Friday was removed from the playbook (even though I called that shit the year before anyway), and for the first time in as long as I can remember, the doors got locked way more often than the normal once a year (6-8pm, Christmas Eve).

Costco pays its wages to obtain a certain caliber of employee and retain them. If the market floor goes up, Costco will need to offer a higher wage to keep attracting and retaining that same employee.

2021-04-23 14:29:06,stocks,Definitely not. It‚Äôs for everyone. A good amount of my investment is with ETF‚Äôs.
2021-04-23 14:51:21,stocks,"ETFs are just a vehicle for diversification, and are extremely useful for people who don't care to learn about every company they invest in.

I do my own DD for individual companies, and I buy ETFs for sectors that are too difficult to pick individual winners in (clean energy for example). 

An ETF will lower your risk, but also your reward potentially."

Easy way to make sector bets where you aren't an industry expert.  and One of the best market evolutions to have come along.  Boomers mostly have their money managed by somebody else they pay, which means if they are in ETFs somebody else is making the decision."

2021-04-23 14:13:26,stocks,"I‚Äôve used the product and it‚Äôs fine. But from people who use the latest and greatest, AYX is ancient. That‚Äôs not a good sign for them. Not to mention to run certain things within their instances can be super slow. I‚Äôd rather run code outside of AYX and bring in results than run the code within AYX."
2021-04-23 14:57:32,stocks,Our company used to use Alteryx but have since switched to Snowflake and couldn't be happier.  Snowflake even costs less.  Snowflake is disrupting pretty much all of the established data/analytics sw vendors.
2021-04-23 14:58:07,stocks,"Better tools in the market for data prep and simple modeling. Alteryx is clunky, the UI is meh.  Dataiku is better."
2021-04-23 16:20:50,stocks,"I can literally do everything in Alteryx for free in R and/or Python. Alreryx is great for quick and dirty data transformation and mock-ups, but other software does just as good a job for cheaper/free."
2021-04-23 15:53:22,stocks,"I am recently long alteryx and have a different opinion.

1. Alteryx has just about the highest margins in the business - 90%+. Compare these to SNOW or PLTR or other data analysis companies, it‚Äôs not close.
2. I view Alteryx as a COVID recovery play. I don‚Äôt think companies have been recently eager to make big, transformational data analysis purchases
3. I think the possibility of a buyout is not unlikely 
4. While guidance has been soft in recent quarters, the company does consistently beat earnings expectations
5. Valuation. AYX has been profitable and can be so again. It‚Äôs currently trading at 10x revenues, which while not cheap, looks like a bargain compared to ~100x for SNOW or ~40x for PLTR, neither of which have shown profitability."
2021-04-23 14:15:56,stocks,"I'm with you. I've used it, and it's ""okay."" Your thoughts on how ancient is feels is one of the key points of my hypothesis above, they don't spend nearly enough on R&D despite their huge margins. They're only focused on selling their existing ancient product.

Not good long term IMO."
2021-04-23 15:45:27,stocks,can second this. i first used it in my jr year of college. i fucking hated alteryx. it seemed like it was some kid's toy coding program.
2021-04-23 18:03:15,stocks,"Yep, my company switched from Alteryx to Databricks, which I‚Äôve really enjoyed using for the most part."
2021-04-23 19:33:57,stocks,"People can write their own software packages too or build anything if they know how to code. Alteryx is for the non-coders, which is a growing segment. No-code / Low-code is where things are headed.

Having said all that. Alteryx isn't all that great. RapidMiner and Dataiku are better products"
2021-04-23 14:17:16,stocks,"I‚Äôve just found the use case isn‚Äôt that flexible. You have to find something you want to automate away and then spend time doing so with their platform. AYX is awful for ad hoc quick and dirty procedures, so I ended up using it for maybe 1 process? After trying to justify its use case for everything else I work on."

2021-04-23 15:05:57,stocks,"There is always a heavy indigestion period after they buy big companies (becasue they over pay to acquire new product pipelines) . Two examples GILD ( Div 4.5pct) and BMY ( 3pct)

2021-04-23 15:02:31,stocks,"There is always a heavy indigestion period after a major buy out ( since they overpay to buy); good examples are GILD ( paying 4.5pct) and BMY ( 3pct). I am splitting my money 70:30, GILD : BMY until BMY breaks meaningfully."
2021-04-23 15:09:05,stocks,It is a challenge for a stock to break out over resistance ( that is why it is called resistance). Skeptical owners ( like you ?) are hesitant ; once the break out is confirmed then a lot of new comers jump in and those skeptics if they sold watch the train leave the station. No one can predict the future; which is why one has to be patient and confirm a breakout. Another stock undergoing indigestion ( due to a major buy ) is GILD paying 4.5pct; I am accumulating that one too.
2021-04-23 17:04:35,stocks,"I said "" on the verge ""; yet to confirm a breakout; a close above 66.50 on heavy volume. Price and volume confirm each other."

2021-04-23 19:34:49,stocks,"That's  it true and anyone who's traded something other then meme stocks for a week or two would know. Bad earnings may tank the stock but so do good usually since they trigger a sell-off. Playing earnings is a fools gamble, even a novice investor knows this.



Also there is as much proof of technical analysis working as there is for essential oils and horoscopes; *none*. Not one single peer review study has ever been able to showcase TA actually working, because it doesn't. It may work on history but no patter can ever predict the future. If you got an peer-reviewed study claiming otherwise I'm all ears."

2021-04-23 13:27:45,stocks,"I'm in the same boat, and I've been skipping the international crowd in favor of the homefront. This seems like a good price point to get into MSOS, and I've been adding to my position there. With passage of the SAFE Banking Act and (too-many-to-count) politicians talking up American legalization with or without Biden, I think MSOS is a good play for when things change on the home front. Will that be this year? Maybe. But it could just as well be 5 years from now. Either way... when it happens, I believe MSOS is going to pop off much more so than the weed ETFs that are focused on Canadian equities (MJ, TOKE, CNBS, etc). MSOS is also actively managed FWIW, as is YOLO (same people). Although, I believe YOLO has its hands in the same Canada-specific companies that aren't going to show significant growth without a much bigger American customer. 

TL;dr- I think MSOS will have the steadiest growth and eventual returns of any weed ETF. Instead of splitting your attention, I'd put more eggs in the American weed basket now, while it's still quite affordable. 

Not a cat, not financial advice, yadda yadda"
2021-04-23 13:13:34,stocks,I‚Äôm a fan of the ETF‚Äôs for the same reason you stated.
2021-04-23 13:36:27,stocks,"The MJ ETF was a staple of my portfolio for 4 years. It provided mediocre returns and even more mediocre dividends. I bought MJ at $15 almost on the penny, and when it hit the 30-32 range in the past 12 months I cashed out completely for something with better returns. 

Fast forward to today and my new portfolio is established and balanced, and I decided to buy 5 shares of MJ at $20. I believe in the long-term potential of the fund, it will only get better when banks are actually allowed to do business with the stores. But that‚Äôs still a long ways away IMO. I opened the position and will add to it with my leftover dividends and CC commissions, but it is a secondary investment for me."

2021-04-23 13:54:13,stocks,"Yes, which is why I'm loading up during the lull. MSOS is uniquely tied to American legalization. The moment we're federally green-lit, it's on like donkey kong."

2021-04-23 12:55:35,stocks,"It‚Äôs a confluence of events: lots of newbies started last year during covid. They have questions now that things are rockier. Proponents of index investing come out to tell them about that strategy (me included). Mathematically picking individual stocks isn‚Äôt optimal and we can discuss why, but everyone is just trying to give their opinion and advice as to what‚Äôs most appropriate going forward.

Edit: with regards to your post‚Äôs title, you already take risk (the market risk) by holding index funds. Holding individual stocks adds an element of uncompensated risk, where you‚Äôre not getting a higher expected return for that added risk. Just something to keep in mind."
2021-04-23 16:36:56,stocks,"I think the people that are loudest on here have the least market experience and have invested the most in largely speculative areas.  Lots of companies show up in emerging technology areas, and most will fail.  A few survive and in hindsight everybody thinks it is obvious why they should have owned them.  In 1999 everyone thought it was obvious that they should have owned Cisco and whole bunch of other tech stocks.  Cisco survived (it peaked around 82, troughed around 8, and hasn't ever recovered its 2000 high) but has been close to dead money and the vast majority of the rest went ""poof"" along with some well known corporate names at the time.

This isn't 1999 again yet ... you can tell by the level of fear.  Bull markets climb the ""wall of worry"" and die when you can't find bearish opinions in the mainstream any more.  actual growth stocks are doing fine (what you call growth stocks are better thought of as speculative stocks)

keep an eye out, but corrections within the cycle are normal, as well as sectoral corrections.  However some areas of speculation can crop up, peak, and never return to peak all within the same bull market context.  it's important to have price targets based on fundamentals for everything."
2021-04-23 15:04:24,stocks,"The most meaningful inflation of this time is inflation of risk. When I started investing, 75% stock - 25% bonds was considered risky.

Jumping from plane without parachute is nothing if you not wrestling with a wild tiger at the same time."

So it really depends on ones conviction and risk tolerance to play the growth stocks.  On something that I am not knowledgable enough to break it down to figure out their intrinsic value , I prefer a Small position and my entry point is based on technical analysis.  Then I gradually build my position based on their fundamentals .  In between , I ask people that I know ( All that social network that I build from college were worth it) especially the ones who does not invest for their their technical expertise.

For a stock like in the sector where I am familiar with.  I go long and buy every dip starting at 5%."
2021-04-23 13:57:28,stocks,"If you're picking stocks you're already taking risks, but I don't want to take dumb risks. Companies that are up 50%+ in a year are much more likely to dip than continue to rise at similar rates in the short-term and I have no interest in catching a ride on an exploding rocket.

Also if you're buying into a company that is pre-profit/positive FCF, much less pre-revenue then you better have a very good reason why to and it being hyped isn't adequate. It's much easier to come up with a neat idea than to make money off of said idea.

If the company is really that good you're likely to have plenty of opportunities to buy after the business model starts being proven regardless. Most revolutions are only obvious with hindsight and happen much more incrementally than people expect."

Especially these ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù penny stocks everyone talks about on this website. SPY, MSFT, and AAPL are pretty much guaranteed to still make money and retain value even if tech crashed. And with normies getting into investing, it‚Äôs getting tricky out here in the market. Normies are usually the last people to invest before a crash because they are dumb money. So be careful and do your due diligence and you‚Äôll make hella $$$$ because now is the time. Good luck my guy."
2021-04-23 17:56:47,stocks,"I purchased some LOTZ stock this week when it hit its 52 week low. I like their business model, and their customers seem to have very positive experiences (more so than Vrooom or Carvana). They also have  so much room to expand, so I decided why not.

Also, once you work with Palantir, you cannot get rid of Palantir. They basically make it impossible to drop them and their expensive annual contract costs. Also, many companies need the data integration services they provide and may eventually need their analysis services. However, to be honest, their analysis capabilities aren't that great, but still better than their competitors. I am basically buying this one because I know many organizations need this service, will use Palantir because they're more flashy than their competitors, and will be too dumb to figure out an exit strategy."

2021-04-23 16:49:07,stocks,"I think TQQQ is a great way to start a portfolio. Find your own risk tolerance but do 100% TQQQ until your portfolio is 50k for example and then start dialing it back in to some safer stuff. Might as well go high risk high reward when you don't have  a big portfolio because the dollar amount can be recovered and built back up with deposits from your job. I wouldn't hold 300k TQQQ if you only make 60k per year at your day job for example because you could lose 250K in a few months of a market crash. I would feel comfortable holding 100k TQQQ, 200k index fund ETF.

But if you make 60k per year in your day job and your 50k portfolio in 100% TQQQ if the market crashes and you lose 40k that isn't so bad."

2021-04-23 13:05:57,stocks,"I agree that it's difficult. Success can only be measured over the long term (10+ years) since beating the index every year is a meaningless benchmark (given that the market tends to crash once in a while). So you'd have to beat the compound return of an index over long time periods (rather than every year). In particular, it is OK to lag the index in some years if that allows you to loose less in a crash (and hence outperform the market over the long run)."
2021-04-23 16:55:01,stocks,"I think everyone has their own level of assessment. I have done loads of research on the speculative plays I'm invested in, and I have assessed that most of them are likely the best in their respective sector. I have also come to the conclusion that right now, specifically for the highly speculative plays, is the best time with the least amount of risk associated to start building a position.

As for beating the index consistently, I don't think thats my goal and its somewhat of a foolish one. But right now at this time, I think there is ample reason to believe that for the next few years the speculative stocks will outperform the market if they can maintain their current roadmap and projections for the future."

I understand the basic risk of investing in anything, but when I discuss risky stock picks that's an entirely different conversation."

2021-04-23 14:43:47,stocks,"They will certainly stay afloat, the question is if buying them now will give you good returns in 10 years (as opposed to buying something else and then buying these later say during a coming crash)."
2021-04-23 16:44:05,stocks,It‚Äôs been disappointing me since I bought it
2021-04-23 13:10:29,stocks," Not sure if lagging the index is okay if you have the possibility of losing less in a crash later on, we simply can‚Äôt make that future assessment. Either way, even if you buy a stock you think is heavily discounted, you‚Äôre still taking on that uncompensated risk. Even if you held 20, 30, 100 of them, at that point why not just own the whole market and diversify that away? Capture the entire market premium since most market gains are generated by a very small handful of stocks."
2021-04-23 13:31:52,stocks,"The relevant concept is that of risk-adjusted return, for which the simplest estimate is provided by the [Sharpe ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp).

Notice however that the Sharpe ratio is only an estimate of this, because downside risk is worse that upside fluctuations so statistical volatility is an imperfect measure of risk."
2021-04-23 13:12:20,stocks,"I think you misunderstand what I mean. High risk is fine, you just aren‚Äôt getting the proper expected future return when you assume that risk. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you perceive it to be high, medium, low risk; that‚Äôs just simply how it goes. Anyway the math and research are out there if you are curious. It‚Äôs not intuitive; I picked stocks for a long time too but I‚Äôve come around on it."
2021-04-23 19:48:26,stocks,"No they don‚Äôt. If that were true, then non leveraged ETFs would also go to 0 because they also suffer from volatility drag, although to a lesser degree."
2021-04-23 13:41:02,stocks,"I would agree with you if the example were to be say,  UVXY. I don't think bull index leveraged ETFs will trend towards zero, the underlying even trends upwards."
2021-04-23 13:13:27,stocks,"My biggest mistakes with CC‚Äôs is fomoing into buying back a call I wrote. Be ready early on to get assigned and just wheel it back with a cash secured put until assignment. 

It gets easier when you are able to build up some free shares bought with premium."
2021-04-23 13:14:04,stocks,"Well you asked for a benchmark and that would be the rational one. Of course we can only know aposteriori and this is why the truly great investors distinguish themselves through their long time performance (over 20 years and more).

As a general idea you can guesstimate the risk of being in certain markets, sectors etc. and diversify away appropriately to improve your Sharpe ratio. You can do that with indices (say by going international) and over asset classes as well as by picking stocks, hedging etc. It's nontrivial and it takes work."
2021-04-23 17:02:35,stocks,Thanks for this. Will try to understand haha.
2021-04-23 17:01:39,stocks,"I would love more of an explanation, this is kind of new to me. What do you mean that I'm not getting the proper expected future return just from high risk?

The way I interpret it(in a very simplified way)

Higher risk = higher potential return but also higher potential losses

Lower risk = Lower potential returns but lower potential losses.

I'm confused as to how you define risk."
2021-04-23 13:42:16,stocks,"It may seem like that because we‚Äôve been in such a huge bull market, but that‚Äôs not the case. One 30% drop in the Nasdaq and you have to rely on a 1000% gain just to break even."
2021-04-23 13:15:22,stocks,Agreed. Just most people don‚Äôt do that and don‚Äôt have the capacity to be that thoughtful about it. Which is why I still feel they‚Äôre better off keeping it simple and not stressing about it.
2021-04-23 18:31:49,stocks,"It's not a very good measure of risk-adjusted return because upside volatility is not true risk (only downside volatility is). Also the usual way to estimate volatility assumes a Gaussian distribution, but the real probability distribution realized by market returns has [skew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) and [kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis). There are more sophisticated measures of risk (and hence of risk-adjusted return) but the Sharpe ratio is good enough for most purposes."
2021-04-23 17:19:50,stocks,"It doesn‚Äôt exactly work like that, there are a lot of scientifique papers about it. Its not that intuitive you don‚Äôt always get compensated for taking the high risk due to how the market functions."
2021-04-23 17:37:57,stocks,"So I‚Äôll use a simple example. Let‚Äôs say you bought stock X that you say is high risk. Let‚Äôs say it works out and you made a 10-bagger. You feel validated because the outcome was what you thought was appropriate relative to the risk. Awesome!

However, there may have been an insanely high chance of that stock going to 0. Just because the outcome worked out doesn‚Äôt mean you made the right decision, had the right strategy. And there‚Äôs the crux of the problem: unless you mathematically analyze the market, you can never know why something happened. We just come up with theories to explain things. 

So from the academic research done, Fama and French (of Fama French 3 or 5 factor fame) and many others have found that more risk doesn‚Äôt mean more expected reward. Idiosyncratic risk or individual risk for companies regardless of whether they‚Äôre ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or ‚Äúlow‚Äù risk is something that you don‚Äôt get a higher expected return for taking on according to their research. So you‚Äôre taking on more risk (which can be measured by a variety of things, standard deviation of returns is commonly used, other inputs or standards exist too) but not going to be expecting a higher return. So why do it?

Again, the mathematical concept or academic concept of risk is not the same as our psychological concept of risk. That‚Äôs why you may be struggling to understand, but I‚Äôm trying to explain things within a mathematical framework of trying to understand the market. So if we accept the research as being explanatory of expected returns (Five Factor model claims to explain 95% of returns), then we need to accept that holding individual stocks is not rational. We aren‚Äôt investing in hopes of higher risk higher returns, we are gambling that higher risk same return or lower ends up working in our favor despite the expectation."
2021-04-23 16:36:47,stocks,"The point still stands, but the 1000% gain you mention is only true if unleveraged. It would be closer to a 300% gain with 3x leverage."
2021-04-23 13:16:41,stocks,I fully agree that indexing and ETFs are the best bet for most people.
2021-04-23 16:49:11,stocks,"congrats to the two of you for having the most insightful discussion in here, which is why it will be ignored :).  cheers."
2021-04-23 16:59:22,stocks,"Yes most people don't have the capacity, but for the few that do where do they go to discuss? The point of this post was to say that I don't feel the individuals who do try and pick the winners instead of setting and forgetting index funds have a place in this sub anymore. It's all met with negativity and pessimism. 

All of my friends who invest generally stick to less stressful, safer plays over the long term that are almost guaranteed to have some sort of return over the next few decades. But for someone like me who craves discussion about undervalued sectors and stuff of that sort, I think the conversations here have diminished to hardly anything.

My theory as to why is because most vocal people in this sub bought into the hype last year and lost a lot of money, and now because of all the new faces with little experience, the overwhelming sentiment tends to lean negative to anything that's not value plays."

2021-04-23 18:15:35,stocks,"I don't think your are wrong about what's happening.  The market has a habit of humiliating people who think they have it figured out (me included at various times).  The thing is that the sort of discussions here aren't  necessarily drawing out the people with experience and they have gotten very short term in perspective.

I personally think anybody putting the work in can beat the market and that you should use all tools to do so... that is, build a core holding out of indexes, within in the context of the market that is happening, and than run plays based on research as your overweight.  if you want to use leverage, go for it, but if you don't know how to manage risk and you don't have a long term viewpoint it's easy to miss the forest because of all the trees.

For one contract, you should be selecting Sell to Open, quantity 1, order type limit, limit set to the going rate for the contract. The type is margin even if you own the shares.

EDIT: I googled this, your type needs to match the underlying shares. did you buy the shares on cash or margin? is there an M next to the shares? I think you just need to make the type Margin."
2021-04-23 13:01:54,stocks,did you recently upgrade to a margin account

The only things pending in any form on my entire account are my purchase prices for my positions (I transferred over from Robinhood two months ago and I guess the purchase history is FINALLY getting ready to be transferred over. It didnt say 'pending' as of yesterday), and my application for level 3 options (in which applying for margin is a part of that process). I suppose the latter *could* have some effect on my ability to complete this trade... but I don't really think so because I'm not using margin or making any trade that my level 1 status doesn't already allow me to do.

If you truly believe in the therapeutic benefits and the possibility of helping millions cope with mental illness in a more holistic and complete way than the traditional pharmaceutical approach, then please consider which companies you choose to invest in and support.

Companies like CMPS have been identified as bad actors in this space, lobbying against decriminalization and legalization reform, e.g. Oregon. Attempting to patent ‚Äúset & setting‚Äù as a treatment approach...

I believe in the power of competition (i.e. capitalism) to innovate, but I also believe in nuance and thoughtful regulation as needed. I made the mistake of jumping into CMPS out of excitement that I could financially participate in a space I ethically and ideologically support so much. I didn‚Äôt perform appropriate due diligence.

Not to say they couldn‚Äôt take off initially, but without any way for these companies to make money other than research grants, they‚Äôll have a hard time keeping investors‚Äô interest.

2021-04-23 14:32:30,stocks,They aren't exactly comparable as they are different industries. It's like comparing a pharmaceutical company to a pop company. Psychedelics are a medical industry with no recreational market. The motivations for price movements will be based off studies and sourcing funding until there is an FDA approval of a therapy.

U/diamondcrushesrock is right. If you've ever done a big trip (well say over 5g.... But mileage varies) you know it's not anywhere near as ""accessible"" as weed. Cubes will make your stomach ache for an hour, and then the trip incapacitates you to varying degrees.

I love big doses. I love high thc marijuana.
I love the intoxication of both.

I kinda see the medical benefits of weed, but Ive only ever used it recreationally.

Psilocybin SHOWS you its medical benefits. I tried it for the recreation, and stayed for the medical benefits I saw that I wasn't even looking for.

I've put around $1500 in various penny shroom stocks in the hopes that they do blow up like weed, but it's pure speculation."

2021-04-23 12:32:28,stocks,"Whether or not it is a boom for the industry, my question would be what is the maximum size of the industry.

People can smoke weed all day (we all know someone who has or does) or once a day or even more casually.  

No one is going to use hallucinogens on that regular of a basis. So if it has a jump would it all be consolidated in a few companies or several. What could total value of market be?   Those would be my questions comparing it to weed."

It's all wishful thinking at this point.  There's too many other securities with boots on the ground that are federally legal and operating for me to even think about that stuff yet.  I did like two swing trades on ACB just because the numbers made sense and pumped and dumped.

> 
> No one is going to use hallucinogens on that regular of a basis. So if it has a jump would it all be consolidated in a few companies or several. What could total value of market be? Those would be my questions comparing it to weed.

Maybe I can expand a bit on that. A lot of people will start telling you you take microdoses nearly daily too. Now one can argue that it is cheap to grow them yourself, but I think a lot of people would rather resort to a medical product. In much of Europe for example, it also would be the only logical choice if your health insurance completly pays for it since many countries don't have stuff like premiums. But microdosing doesn't seem that important anyway (yet).

Most of the research that is currently finished and which is indicating good effects is on psychedelic assisted therapy. Psychedelic assisted therapy all in all takes currently atleast around 25 hours. You have 8 hours prepatory sessions with a therapist, you have two full 6 hour trips in a special facility with 2 people who stay with you, and 3-8 hours therapy integrating the sessions.

This is a process that cannot be replaced by people taking shrooms at home. Not only the therapy, trip sitting and special facility etc. would be missing, you would also have no check ups from a physician before, no medical experts preparing you and so on.

Maybe you can get some bootleg version working out for you, but it is not the same.

Now you are right that people would not need that every day or even every month. You can scale up the costs of psilocybin though and what can make money are the facilities and therapists providing this. (NUMI for example). If this therapy hs a way better effect than antidepressants, and seem to work transdiagnostic not only for depression, but also for anxiety and addiction (!), that would be quite a huge thing. Keep in mind, atleast 30% of the population suffer from a mental disorder in a year."

> Core One's objective in developing the psilocybin thinstrips is to assist with the delivery of revolutionary psychedelic treatment methods to address mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety and addictions.

> Methods of accurate dosing and effective delivery of psilocybin have gone relatively under-researched, and current methods utilized by companies using traditional oral delivery methods can cause hallucinations, digestive issues, and inaccurate dosages resulting in undesired side effects. The Company's patented sublingual transmucosal (orally dissolvable) thinstrip technology, for the delivery of psilocybin, will aim to address these issues, and anticipates the provision of many potential advantages and benefits such as the rapid dissolving and onset of action to the bloodstream, as well as concentration control and time released dosing. Thinstrip delivery technology is a natural, non-toxic, biodegradable, biocompatible composite, which is user friendly. The sublingual polymer thinstrip, with nano particulated active ingredients, skips the digestive system and is absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the membranes in the mouth, resulting in optimum bioavailability (absorption percentage) of the active ingredients. Direct delivery to the bloodstream means that dosages can be less potent with the same affect.

I then switched from mushrooms to 4-aco-dmt.  Far less / no nausia when going down, legal, easy to get online in a pure form from a professional lab due to it being legal.  It just worked better as a migraine medicine for me for these reasons.

Then a doctor prescribed for me sumatriptan, which is what I use today.  It's not a preventative.  I take it when a migraine comes on and it has an hour delay and only lasts for a day so I take one a day for multiple days when I have a migraine.  Online it looks like the long term resistance curve is 7 years, so after 5 years of use I plan on looking towards other medicine.  You never want to be on something too long or you can build up lifelong resistance.

I hope she gets the much needed relief she needs.  If she hasn't tried Sumatriptan, I highly recommend trying it out.  It works better for me than the mushrooms."

But that doesn't mean it's going to be a great financial investment...it's not alcohol or weed where people are buying on a daily basis.

Used correctly, psychedelics provide valuable but psychologically exhausting experiences. I've done plenty of psychedelics and for most people the last thing you want to do after you come down is take more the next day, or even next month.

Idk I don't see how psychedelics become some sort of financial product to profit from, and to be honest I am 100% okay with that! If we end up getting to a point as a culture again where they are treated as medicine or alternative therapy, perhaps they should not be things to be sold for profit at all.

Not sure if this is real science but my experience around 100mg and 800mg feel the same.  My guess is you got spiked with a little bit of acid, dmt and maybe that one with a k (name slips my mind.)

Also, she does tend to get a couple of migraines right before her botox treatment even with the shrooms.  Just before the shrooms she would get them really bad for the week or two before and then weekly after that. Prior to botox they were daily. During that period we just went from Dr to Dr trying to figure out how what was wrong. 


 She has a scale and measures it out, and kinda played with dosing. Essentially once a month or every two months she trips and then she regularly microdoses.  She hates tripping, but its better than suffering.  Then she just eats them as is or puts them on food like pizza."

However, it was worth the shot. She has abdominal, super rare for adults, and some kind of head one(can't remember). The migraines tend to trigger each other and create a loop. She describes the shrooms as reteaching her body. There was about 2 years when they first became a problem that she suffered daily and if we did go out, which was rare, the night would always end when she got a migraine. Sometimes that would be in the car on the way there. About 5 years ago she started getting botox and that gave us her life back, but every day was still a roll of the dice. Since the shrooms we don't really worry anymore. We can get concert or show tickets without fear of just throwing money away because 5 minutes in we have to leave."

There is actually a very broad and growing body of research on the effects of psychedelics since the legalization-for-study processes started in Europe during the early 00s. Mushrooms and ketamine are the two primary medicinal substances being most heavily researched because they have shown the most promising ratio of dosage/side effects to benefits."
2021-04-23 15:07:56,stocks,"This is my mindset one hundred percent on ‚Äúnarcotics‚Äù cause the only time I ever see statements about their benefits when used a certain way is from users, and I dunno if I can trust people who take psychedelics often. 

But I was brainwashed at a young age against drugs so I‚Äôm still deprogramming anyways."
2021-04-23 19:51:54,stocks,"Does this could as ‚Äúreal research‚Äù? https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032994

It‚Äôs definitely early days as far as clinical trials go, but based on what science tells us so far, and the incredible amount of anecdotal evidence, it seems like a very good bet IMO."
2021-04-23 15:20:14,stocks,Yes.
2021-04-23 15:54:59,stocks,Yes you get the medicinal effects without going on a trip.

2021-04-23 14:56:01,stocks,Exactly how I felt about your first comment
2021-04-23 15:04:29,stocks,"Nah, op was a stupid and uneducated response. Already legalized to be used for therapy in some states and a surprising amount of research. It was a great reply. 

Op clearly has no medical or medication knowledge. In the psych field btw, not just bullshitting."
2021-04-23 15:40:30,stocks,"WEED.TO goes back to 2010, and looking at the price action I could see how there was a bit of a collapse after the 2017 boom, it just looked fairly underwhelming compared to the 2018/early 2019 price action. Same with Aphria - I wasn‚Äôt really considering how much the price jumped, and then went down 50%. 

Guess I just wasn‚Äôt looking hard enough!"
2021-04-23 16:47:26,stocks,Not shrooms. Psychedelic assisted therapy with psilocybin. That is quite the difference. It for example doesnt apply to microdosing
2021-04-23 15:11:11,stocks,Because taking magic mushrooms daily definitely doesn't have any societal stigma attached to it
2021-04-23 15:12:35,stocks,"Do you really think that the people who are opposed to pills are willing to take other drugs daily? If those people exist it‚Äôs not a significant group. I know someone that refuses to take any and all pills (ironically he smokes cigs and drinks daily) so it‚Äôs not like his opposition is based on logic. He‚Äôll find a new reason to refuse treatment if it‚Äôs not ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it!‚Äù, as can be seen by the fact that he badly needs to wear glasses but is too stubborn to admit he needs something corrected."
2021-04-23 16:24:03,stocks,"That's a great number to know for evaluating the potential of this whole situation. Thank you.  

My next question would be what is the cost ofnswitching from patented drugs to shrooms.  The research I've done into this is it would save someone using it $100,000 over a 30 year period, but I don't know the base cost of the current drugs.   Also since shrooms can be grown easily, is would a big black market open up (for this specific idea, I know shrooms are sold illegally now and wide spread)  to help people reduce costs and taxes and clinical costs..  in the way there is still a huge black market for weed in states where it is legalized. Kinda like in CO."
2021-04-23 15:30:23,stocks,"This is probably true, but it could attract a lot of investors, myself included, who just want to help push legalization forward. My wife went from spending hours every week in bed with horrible migraines to maybe having one a month. And getting mushrooms is not easy, for me at least.  I could literally lose every penny I invest here and I would not care. This has been my opinion for why Tesla is so highly valued. Some people just want to see electric cars and will buy simply to support the tech."
2021-04-23 16:26:01,stocks,"You do realize peak oil was a thing, right? We got the shale revolution. Advances in farming continue to boost food yields. Precious minerals we need will be mined in space (seriously) and new ways of generating will be discovered. Also, we will just get more efficient in using that energy. Already have -- LED lighting, for instance. As for water, innovation exists and is a thing. Look at what ERII and FSI do. I bet on innovation. Human ingenuity has gotten us very, very far. No reason to believe that will change. AI may well boost that even.

Really need to think about this, man. Preferably when not high, when every thought feels all the more logical üòÇ

Lots of investment opportunities in this. Look at KRBN, CORN, SOYB, etc."
2021-04-23 19:10:32,stocks,"I wouldn't say limited; there's over 40 years worth of scholarly material, way more than limited. MAPS, John Hopkins University, Bristol University, and others have a lot of studies published."

2021-04-23 17:22:36,stocks,"r/clusterheads indeed understands the potential benefits of psychedelics to their quality of life. There really needs to be more research done here. 

Last year I consumed psychedelics on occasion and had no cluster episode. This year I did not have them and am balls deep in my worst cluster yet. Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not. We need more research."
2021-04-23 15:08:51,stocks,None of these are actually about chronic microdosing. Until there are studies specifically about that you're not gonna see businesses trying to sell it
2021-04-23 15:13:05,stocks,"My parents are definitely very conservative so I know what you mean, but I've tried a few times and it's not the end of the world. What I don't know conclusively is that there are real, safe benefits when microdosing.

It might be true but I don't know whether it is. Any mind-altering substance needs a lot of evaluation to be sure before we start promoting it to everyone."
2021-04-23 15:00:58,stocks,I'm not even the person you originally replied too lol
2021-04-23 15:11:26,stocks,"OP said said anyone who is telling you yes or no with certainty is wrong about a stock, that isn't even avaliable to purchase. No ones saying mushroom dont have medical effects. I'm sure you do lots of research on mushrooms with your continued education credits lol"
2021-04-23 18:32:45,stocks,"No actually there was the first ever peer reviewed paper on an RCT for psilocybin for major depression published last week!  Not microdosing, but two trips spaced 3 weeks apart compared to daily Lexapro.  https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032994?query=featured_home&fbclid=IwAR1ikSsQRmw9HVZyPrtuygv5ehQXJ7_z6k9R8yJ1iuWUzp2MjrKAGt_nKPk"
2021-04-23 15:16:10,stocks,You could have said the exact same thing about weed 10 years ago. Once it is recognized medically people are much more willing to try something natural over something that was made and has tons of side effects.
2021-04-23 16:52:22,stocks,I mean a meth like substance is over prescribed to children.
2021-04-23 16:06:43,stocks,"Totally with you on legalization and I think mushrooms are great - but unless they formulate a pill that has zero hallucinogenic effects, I think Id much rather grow my own (incredibly cheap to do) or support my local neighborhood tax-free grower (these are 100 % hypothetical situations). I think the biggest winner will be the one who's first to market with something like that."
2021-04-23 15:43:30,stocks,"You can buy them off of the internet as spores, then you can grow them under your bed or something"
2021-04-23 16:31:10,stocks,"We are years away from farming any resource in space or to talk about new energy if even applicable so that‚Äôs not even in the question. You can‚Äôt bring hypothetical technology into this argument really because you just don‚Äôt know. Just because you have faith in mankind‚Äôs innovation doesn‚Äôt make it viable. You talk about advances in farming but it is projected we only have about 50-100 years left before phosphorus is farmed out which is the key component for food production and the global population is expected to keep expanding rapidly which creates more demand. Humans are overpopulating the earth, oceans are being destroyed, and businesses for profit are dumping massive amounts of waste and pillaging resources because consumers keep buying and it keeps making them money. If you haven‚Äôt had a chance take a trip to Guangzhou, China and see it first hand. It‚Äôs despicable. So look at the broader picture instead of just looking at a man made stock market for profit. Also stop assuming people are high because they think about more than a stock profit and see how terrible corporations actually are. Please lookup any stat that tells you consumerism isn‚Äôt devastating to the environment and resource depletion in general and I will listen to you."

2021-04-23 15:31:40,stocks,"

Oh, yeah I see your point, my b. I think microdosing is kind of a distraction on the topic personally, because it's not a consumer market for legal shrooms, the research is looking for pharmaceutical proof of concepts that are going to try and develop something acquirable. I don't think microdosing is the important sales pitch at the end of the day, because the drugs are famous for having long-lasting effects between treatments.

[A systematic study of microdosing psychedelics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364961/)

[The therapeutic potential of microdosing psychedelics in depression](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2045125320950567)

Microdosing has less solid research because it's a lot of younger people already excited about doing it, and a lot of research is simply self-described testimonials. In my personal experience, I think intermittent regular dosage is more effective than trying to turn psychedelics into nootropics, and what research is out there trends towards that as well.

[Self-Rated Effectiveness of Microdosing With Psychedelics for Mental and Physical Health Problems Among Microdosers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00672/full) 

Microdosing is for a lot of purposes the veganism of drug use. Very loud minority who are happy with their choice to drop acid every day. Which I get. Acid is awesome. I don't think a daily regimen is what we'll see hit the market because the low dose is unlikely to convince outsiders of the benefit."
2021-04-23 15:55:37,stocks,"Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any conclusive studies about the benefits of microdosing, but there is a lot of anecdotal evidence of benefits. Could just be placebo but who really cares if they receive said benefits. 
Micro or macro dosing shouldn‚Äôt be promoted to everyone as it isn‚Äôt for everyone but should be legal. And there‚Äôs a huge market, not as large as cannabis but giant. Market for mushrooms, psilocybin therapy, infused candies and foods, microdosing. 
People are already prepping for legalization in the underground, setting up large grow ops, making professionally packages candies, premade microdose capsules, training facilitators, setting up properties for retreats and therapy"
2021-04-23 15:34:09,stocks,Agreed
2021-04-23 17:15:08,stocks,"No he isn‚Äôt. Not at all. 

Fucking ceu‚Äôs lol. The trick is to know someone that works in licensing. They‚Äôll tell you when you can Renew without them checking. First 3 days are usually golden. 

Even if they do want to check it, you can just back out and try later. 

I actually applied to do a ceu about psychotic symptoms and increased personality disorder symptoms from psychedelics. Super important for therapists to realize the psychosis is easy to stabilize and isn‚Äôt schizophrenia. You really just have to knock them out once with a benzo and they‚Äôre good to go a lot of the time.

I was a huge fan of mushrooms for depression but after working with a few people they all have the same no filtered belligerence and magical thinking, and often a pseudo mania. Just seems annoying. 

I think the real moneymaker will be ketamine clinics. It‚Äôs free money and it‚Äôs safe, and you don‚Äôt have to deal with all the bullshit"

2021-04-23 15:27:01,stocks,"And psychedelics will eventually be accepted, I'm just saying I don't think society is to the point yet where this would be a great investment right now. I'm actually invested myself, but I'm expecting to wait at least 5-10 years for any real gain"
2021-04-23 16:04:31,stocks,"I am a bit hesitant to get things like that mailed to my house. One day I may have no choice, but at least for now I have a friend who lets me know when he can get some and we stock up. Seems to last a little while sealed in the freezer."
2021-04-23 15:35:29,stocks,"I agree. There might be some potential in marketing microdoses someday but it's early. It's evidence in depression though is very strong and I think that's what it's really gonna be known for. The science is still early but there's some very promising results already. Add to that the fact that there haven't been many real advancements in the antidepressant market in a long time, and they can really be the next big thing"

Disclaimer: I'm holding TQQQ for a couple of months now, bought a bit before the March correction. Those time suck balls, bought on the way up and it has been fantastic, almost 25% up now. You can absolutely hold it long term but you should have a strategy. Holding SQQQ long term though, now that's a really bad idea."
2021-04-23 12:54:13,stocks,"I think the real reason everyone cautions against them as long term vehicles is because volatility is so high it is pretty easy to lose a lot of money and everyone who is cautioning against them is doing so to cover their own risk of liability.  This doesn't mean they don't work in the positive direction, clearly they can and they have.  Leverage is a two edged sword regardless of how you employ it.

There are some papers that describe some interesting things that few people talk about such as this one (look at optimum leverage curves for particular markets): [http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php](http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php)

It is also true they do tend to perform worse than 2x or 3x on downside and a little under 2x or 3x on upside.   This still magnifies returns in a bull... and we are probably in the final third of the longest bull in history.   How much longer do we have?  we don't know.  If you have the wherewithal to identify a bear early then you probably have the wherewithal to use leveraged ETFs to magnify returns.

I have owned a little bit of TECL since 2009.  Its performance hasn't sucked."
2021-04-23 13:47:03,stocks,"nothing wrong with holding.

just set a trailing stop loss."
2021-04-23 12:29:16,stocks,"
 - When the underlying moves down the leveraged moves down *further*.     
 - When the underlying recovers the leveraged doesn't recover *fully*.   
 - When they move sideways they always lose money.      
 - You're betting on a bull market and against a bear market with a leveraged ETF.   

You're looking at a graph of the most aggressive bull period that stretches back years. If you legitimately believe that will continue then I suppose you could risk it in e.g. TQQQ, but if you expect sideways movement or pullbacks then it is a bad investment, and you'll lose money in real terms."
2021-04-23 12:22:57,stocks,TQQQ and SQQQ at least settle daily.  You are going to magnify your losses.  The Project Option dude has a good video on it.
2021-04-23 12:25:10,stocks,"read the prospectus on TQQQ and you will clearly see it‚Äôs meant to deliver the leveraged returns on a daily timeframe. Once you get past that, to keep it simple, they have to re-leverage the portfolio each day based on assets that flowed in/the day‚Äôs returns. 

So there‚Äôs decay, and plus if you‚Äôre 3x levered and get hit with a massive drop, your drop and recovery levered is going to be worse than non-levered QQQ. Also, just because it has historically been okay doesn‚Äôt mean going forward it‚Äôll perform the same way."

2021-04-23 12:45:00,stocks,"Just a heads up, the dow is a garbage index since it doesn't adjust stock price to market cap, it essentially just adds them all up.

ex: 

Company 1 has 10 shares worth $10 each

Company 2 has 2 shares worth $50 each

Both companies are worth $100, the ""dow"" for this group is 60 ($10+$50)

if Company A loses 10% of its value its shares are now worth $9 each and the dow drops to 59 ($9+$50)

if Company B loses 10% of its value its shares are now worth $45 and the dow drops to 55 ($10+$45)

In both cases the market lost the same amount of value, but in the second case the dow dropped by more just because company B has less shares.

This is why most people who actually care about stocks ignore the dow and focus on the S&P 500 instead"

2021-04-23 15:32:42,stocks,Debatable. And OP even says his dad can‚Äôt afford the risk he can because of his age. And obviously there‚Äôs a reason why his dad is skeptical of a market retraction... because he lacks time to ride them out. Which OP has plenty of. 40 is a hard age to judge risk IMO. He could be nearing retirement. Why would you take risk when you are near retirement. He‚Äôs a government employee he might get a pension which would give him more money to be more risky. Some people can afford to be risky at 40 and others can‚Äôt and others simply don‚Äôt need to be is my point.

I will admit that I do not go into deep dives into a company's financial statements and prefer sector ETFs (I have a large chunk of change in XLK), but I do not believe these products would be explicitly stated in Apple's financial statements.

I would never tell you what to do with your retirement, especially since you seem like a bright person.

Hi all, I am playing around with a backtesting script, and I'm noticing that some of my stocks are stopping out due to after hours prices--usually I only get a little bit of after hours data from the Alpaca API, but it can be jumpy/erratic--and lead my script to trigger a ""sale"". So I am not sure if I should include or exclude these after hour bars in my script. Here's an example, I have a stock that is climbing in price steadily for several days, but during one after hours period, the data briefly shows a big dip in price--lower than the sell threshold.

2021-04-23 11:35:38,stocks,"Depends on order duration type.

By default most limit orders (including stop limits, stop losses) execute during day trading hours.

You can specify other order durations if you want to have them action after hours as well. Most brokers I've used call this GTEM (good till extended market) as opposed to the default DAY (during market hours) duration.

Limit order is an order type, stop limit is a type of limit order, and GTEM/DAY/etc are order durations (times of execution)."

It's called the spread and that's all there is to it. Why is the spread higher for RBC compared to MSFT? Because MSFT is more liquid. There are more buyers and sellers which pushes the spead closer."
2021-04-23 10:19:23,stocks,"It is the BID/ASK spread, whoever is calling it the BUY/SELL is making this confusing.   

It is an auction: the BID is what buyers are trying to pay, and the ASK is what sellers are willing to take. Generally the match is somewhere between the two and moves throughout the day as ASK-ers move down or BID-ers move up (or visa-versa).   

You should aim not to pay either the BID or ASK prices, since a good deal is normally in the middle."

In practice, stock prices move fast, and brokerage typically charge a minimum trading fee (for mine, its at least 3 dollars if the trade is below 3000 dollars, and 0.1% over 3000 dollars), the difference between buy and sell price in practice is different.

Also if buy and sell price you are referring to is the bid and offer, then they just are prices the traders on 2 sides are asking for, so that‚Äôs pretty much random (depends on what people are willing to pay or sell for)"

2021-04-23 00:00:00,stocks,"People tend to close positions when they have no cash to buy the dip. How much of your portfolio is cash? We keep hearing about how overbought everything is. I will point out certain stocks myself at times. I believe that as long as people have cash on the sidelines I don't see a long term dip. They want to put the cash to work and they will as their positions face correction levels. CNBC posted an article about cash positions increasing and this is comforting to me rather than ""the sky is falling.""

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/more-wealthy-go-to-cash-but-millionaire-market-bears-still-minority.html

The more cash that is out of the market the quicker the stock market will recover (unless there is a better place to put that money to work). Since there is no better place to put that money any 5 to 10 percent dip will start bringing the ""new money"" back into the market.

When everyone is tapped out and all their cash is in the market those corrections hurt. They have left no room for purchasing more shares and closing positions to free up cash becomes a logical move. This compounds the selling off of a particular stock. 

With more people moving to cash I say the ""buy the dip"" mantra will continue. 

So the question is, how much cash do you currently have?"

Cash earns nothing over the long term. Even at today's market levels, we should expect 5-7% returns over the long run. I'll take 5% returns over my ability to time the market any day. 

That is to say, my approach is valuation based. I actually went 20% bonds at the end of 2019. Not because I expected a crash or anything, but because bonds were yielding 3% and the shiller PE, being around 33 at the time, indicated that market returns would be in that 6-7% range. We weren't getting compensated for the additional risk we were taking on in the market. Now, with bonds yielding 1.5%, the risk/reward profile of the market does make sense."

 - Past price is no guarantee of future price.

A lot of people took issue with my insight and accused me of trying to time the market. But like, all the money I intend to invest long term is already in the market, so I'm not timing it.

Articles and posts like this encourage me that I'm not an idiot and it is true that I need to wait until the dip is an actual dip more like 5 - 10% before I buy in, and then still not get FOMO and go all in same day. Because in March I added $2000 to my portfolio but when all this is done I will only be up hardly $20. I think it's bad to have trigger finger and 'buy the dip' on the small dips. I only want to boost it up on larger corrections that are at least 10% (considering my positions are small so that's what would be worth it to me, to tie up my cash for so long).

For example, let's say you're diversified and fully in long for most (and waiting on a few short plays to happen). In a big dip all over the board like we're seeing no are likely plays to be made that may workout faster than current long positions (hard to say though, big news could be in wks or a yr+).

2021-04-23 12:26:43,stocks,"You have to understand that everyone is in a different position in their life and has different goals. Not everyone is laser focused on making The Most Amount of Money Possible. I have my emergency fund of 3 months living expenses. I have separate funds for car repair, dentist, medical co-pays, even throw $5-10 into a clothes budget and build it up over the year. I don't invest any of that money and it stays in my checking.

However I also have another savings that is separate that I generally keep out of the market, but it sits in my brokerage. For my risk tolerance, I am not tolerant to go 100% invested. My goal is not to make the maximum possible profit at maximum possible risk. My goal is to be responsible and consistent. I want to have a chunk of cash easily accessible -- I might suddenly need/want it without compromising my hard work to build my living buffer. However, it is just sitting there, so I could potentially use it in a temporary way to buy the dip. I don't want this money invested long term, and that's the risk. If I fully invest all the time then I may not be able to get that money back out if I want my cash. I might have to wait 6 months for it to be a good time to pull it out. So to be worth it to me, to risk losing it or to risk having to wait a long time to get it back, the reward needs to be greater. The reward needs to be greater than my personal value of having cash on hand buffering my account and giving me flexibility in my life. I'm not going to spend my living buffer if my AC dies and I want to get a new unit, etc.

It's like on one hand everyone says INVEST ONLY WHAT YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE but on the other hand people like me that DO EXACTLY THAT get shit on and accused of timing the market or otherwise called dumb. I am investing ONLY WHAT I AM WILLING TO LOSE so I have cash savings as well that I am not as willing to lose. That means I only want to invest it if the dip is large enough to tempt me into it."

We keep 6-9 months on hand in either a 3.30% APY checking account or towards bank bonuses (i.e. $400 for depositing $15k). Semi-passive ROI for the last 5 years has actually outperformed a nominal 10% market return. 

We do however have backup emergency funds if truly necessary (brokerage, HSA) therefore we're willing to have the EF move on a string - right now it's at 6 months from buying recent dips. It'll likely rise back to 9 months before any additional is automatically invested. 

The dry powder argument doesn't need to be binary, although I do err on the side of investing what you have and not trying to time the market."
2021-04-23 10:58:48,stocks,Holding cash may not be the most min/max move but it gives people comfort and a hedge against a down market and makes it easier to take profits during a bull run. If you believe the opposite then why not trade on margin.

2021-04-23 14:29:17,stocks,"I have to see I do greatly agree with you.
But I have to say that I‚Äôm one of those that do say ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù.

Its something that can be overused, and I get that. I try to explain it the best way I can.

For me buying the dip is if $ABC is at $30 and went down to $22 and the current valuation is lets say $50. Buying it at $30 is a good price but buying at $22 is definitely a dip. (of-course DD has to be done to know the reason it dipped also if evaluation is still accurate etc.) But buying at $22 and it goes back and even struggle to go above lets say $25/$30 you can still be profitable.

Now this is different depending if you‚Äôre day, swing, short or long term. Each has their own strategy: big difference between day trade and long term.

Imo buying the dip is getting in on a stock that has growing potential that by the time the dip ‚Äúmay‚Äù come you‚Äôll still be profitable.

I know and agree with you that last month price doesn‚Äôt mean it validates a future price. But with DD you can be more certain and correct in predicting.
We never know but DD is better than gambling.

At one hand short sellers sucks sometimes seeing a stock goes down without a reason, but if there is no catalyst you know that‚Äôs a nice way to add to you‚Äôre high convictions. (Short/longterm play)"

2021-04-23 17:50:09,stocks,"I agree with only investing what you're willing to lose but if your core investment is a total market index fund, you're not going to lose your whole investment unless the entire market crashes. If that happens, we'll all be in trouble no matter how much we saved. Having too much in cash can be an issue if you have a steady income.

It's my opinion, but I think (as long as you have an income) once you calculate your budget for your emergency fund and set extra aside, you can move the rest to a total market fund to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. If you hold long term, you should have thousands in capital gains available to tap into if you absolutely need it, even during a downturn. Some people use bond funds instead of savings accounts to hold emergency funds, but that was mostly before the COVID crisis. It sounds like you have more than enough if you wanted to increase your investment, but it's your choice.

The yield on savings accounts will rise eventually (there was a time when just a savings account was a reasonable investment). If your checking account doesn't earn interest, you might want to move more funds to high yield savings. You should still have the same level of access in an emergency, and your cash will be earning something instead of sitting there."
2021-04-23 12:38:04,stocks,">  If I fully invest all the time then I may not be able to get that money back out if I want my cash.    

Investing when the market is stable: Too big of a risk.     
Investing when the market is free-falling: Correct amount of risk.   

> So to be worth it to me, to risk losing it or to risk having to wait a long time to get it back, the reward needs to be greater.   

The reward is greater with longer term diversified investment than holding cash and trying to time the market.    

> I'm not going to spend my living buffer if my AC dies and I want to get a new unit  

So if you ""buy the dip"" your AC isn't allowed to die? But every other time it is allowed to die, and that is what that money is earmarked for?    

This post is self-contradictory, and it really has to be because the whole concept of ""buy the dip"" (time the market) and ""hold cash [somehow]"" is also flawed at its core, and as you poke at it, it collapses. Catching a falling knife isn't a good investment strategy, nor is holding money until the market is its least stable a way to avert risk."
2021-04-23 11:16:20,stocks,"> hedge against a down market    

Actually it assures a down market *every year*, because in bull years they lose money and in bear years they barely make it up. For example if you followed this wonderful strategy from 2011 until today you'd have lost $263.95 in VTI on every $100 in cash, but made $61~ by buying the dip in March 2021 (assuming you hit the absolutely bottom, which is unlikely).   

More likely scenario: You hold $100 in cash, lose $263.95 in opportunity costs, and then miss the bottom anyway and make $40 in 2021.   

>  If you believe the opposite then why not trade on margin.   

What kind of question is that? If I believe that there's no *good* way to hold large amounts of cash, that automatically means I should think borrowing money (inc. fees, interest, and potential margin calls) must be a good idea?   

It is like a 1 + 1 = 9493494 kind of logic. Wtf."

2021-04-23 12:54:31,stocks,"*Investing when the market is stable: Too big of a risk.Investing when the market is free-falling: Correct amount of risk*

**No. I am fully invested at the % of my assets that I am comfortable fully investing. I do not time the market or when I buy. I set it aside from my paychecks and at the end of the month I buy a couple shares. I don't even look at the graphs.**

*The reward is greater with longer term diversified investment than holding cash and trying to time the market.*

**That is why I do not wait and hold on to my money that I am willing to remain invested long term. I do not hold onto that money until 'the right time to buy'. I finish my monthly bills and then buy my shares.**

I don't understand why this concept is so difficult for others to understand. If I have 20k and I am willing to have 10k invested long-term in the stock market, then I put that money in the market. It's in there, it's fully invested. Money has more uses than 'investment'. There is 10k left. Let's say 6k is 3 month living buffer. Okay. Now 1k for various savings for car, etc. When all is said and done there is 3k left. What to do with that 3k? I don't want to invest it in the market, the 50% of my assets is the limit of what I want in the market. That 3k is an extended buffer with no designated role, it is flexible, I can use it how I decide to use it at any given time without impacting my investments or my living buffer/budgets.

To decide I want to GO OVER 50% INVESTED the reward needs to look pretty enough to me. I'm not saying to buy on a free-fall. Come on now. There are so many posts saying a 5-10% correction is healthy and normal. Seeing a -10% drop on funds I'm already in, and planning to remain in for the long term, would be enough for me to decide to go to 65% invested in the market, for a temporary period of time until it comes back up (which may even be 1 year, which is why it needs to be worth it to hold my cash for 1 year).

It is exactly RISK versus REWARD. The RISK is me not having my highly-valued extra cash on hand. I have a high value for cash, perhaps more than you do. That is fine. The REWARD needs to outweigh my high value of having some cash on hand to have freedom and flexibility to do whatever I want with it, whether that is temporary investing, or buying something, etc, there is no designed job for that money. If I lose it all, then I am not in danger, as I still have my emergency fund. It's money I dont need **NOW** but I might prefer to have it **LATER** within 1-2 years. Like I'm getting braces within a  year, I don't need that money **NOW** but I also don't want it tied up in the stock market for 6 months."

2021-04-23 11:43:26,stocks,"Remember when kanye left nike for adidas in 2015? Nike didnt bluff and continued to be one of the best companies at marketing itself. 



Im not concerned"
2021-04-23 14:20:39,stocks,How is GAP more ethical than Nike though? It‚Äôs all the same slave labor and irresponsible materials sourcing.
2021-04-23 14:43:52,stocks,"First Kobe‚Äôs estate, now Simone, kind of interesting. If China decides to H&M Nike that would get really juicy. If LBJ actually cared about broad equal human rights he may consider leaving Nike but lets be real - he doesn‚Äôt - and won‚Äôt be leaving Nike any time soon. Could be a good dip, but I may wait for more. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Jay Z or someone launched a shoe business to disrupt them all at some point. He‚Äôs definitely got the strategic connections, wonder if it‚Äôs allowed with the sports agency.

Anyways, I‚Äôd probably give it a second to see how the market processes the downgrade and how this China thing shakes out. Just me personally, Nike has been a resilient company and they‚Äôre no dummies."
2021-04-23 12:47:57,stocks,"The sweatshop argument has been made for decades now. Nothing will change on that front.

Simone Biles is a very small player in Nike's portfolio of assets. Gymnastics is only extremely popular during the Olympics. There is a reason why Nike opted to put Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka over Simone and that's because women's tennis is probably the highest revenue generating demographic for women sports and is year-round. Simone Biles is not a recognizable figure in the grand scheme of things.

LeBron's dumb comments aren't a huge issue because it will die down within a week. Consumer spending will increase due to more outdoor activities being opened up. I wouldn't be worried about Nike here."
2021-04-23 10:44:33,stocks,Glad I took profits at 140
2021-04-23 10:17:47,stocks,Mary Cain already left
2021-04-23 10:07:30,stocks,I've been trying to tell people about $GPS for a while now. This is great news but the real monster that will drive $GPS is the collab they are releasing with Kanye West. They have a 10 year deal where he will be given creative control over The Gap (clothes and store design) - the collection is set to drop very soon and I think it will be HUGE for GPS.
2021-04-23 15:02:24,stocks,"A lot of female athletes have been mad at Nike due to some of their maternity leaves and sponsorships (Google: Alysia Monta√±o) for a while now - this started in 2019.

A lot of their athletes are woke, but still stay sponsored by Nike (LOL).

Nike's share price won't change a bit because people don't really care."
2021-04-23 09:55:02,stocks,"The Kobe line is finished, a huge chunk of european soccer players have switched, they lost their big two in the Crossfit market when Fraser quit and Sigmundsdottir blew her knee out, Tiger obviously isn't going to be on TV any time soon and Lebron is...doing Lebron things again.  That's ignoring the constant sweatshop accusations, the China angle and the fact that Biles is implying some pretty un-Oregon behavior coming from HQ.

Citi has already downgraded them and I'm expecting more to follow."
2021-04-23 09:12:12,stocks,Good! Fuck Nike and fuck Lebron.
2021-04-23 13:36:01,stocks,Nike will be okay as long as the sweatshops keep producing sneakers and the likes of Lebron keep putting out statements that support China!
2021-04-23 14:42:02,stocks,Is this a off-season r/stocks post? I didn‚Äôt even know she was with Nike.
2021-04-23 15:43:17,stocks,Simone Biles means as much to Nike as my dog does.  This is irrelevant.
2021-04-23 15:46:11,stocks,"Nike will be okay, it sponsors so many major sports and makes most of its money off shoes anyways.

GAP will be fine, it seems a bit undervalued to me (it's cheaper than AEO shares but does way more sales through many brands) - I think it's worth it if you want a very consumer driven stock to hold for a bit. I think the bigger thing to look out for is what benefit will GAP see now that Synchrony is out of the picture...will Barclays offer a half-decent private-label card?? That could be key for them, they have credit cards for each of their stores and the portfolio movement is huge."

Nike has a very diverse and talented line up of athletes that have larger public presence both on field, screen and in activist movements and conversations.   
I would say differently if other athletes heavily engrained in Nike products were terminating their partnerships - Whether that's Jordan and Jordan Brand, Kyrie Irving, Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal, Sue Bird, Lebron James, Colin Kaepernick, Paul Rodriguez. I could go on..."

They still have massive deals with NBA, NFL, MLB, loads of college programs, major soccer clubs, Jordan brand, Drake etc. and they are still at the forefront of athletics and streetwear. Crossfit is probably not even a profitable division for Nike lol.

The Kobe stuff is just about the only thing that'll hit them and even that I wouldn't be surprised if they make their way back into the fold at some point with a restructured deal."

2021-04-23 11:55:49,stocks,"Nah I think you're wrong man. Kanye is crazy, yes, but his ego is massive and he's constantly trying to prove something to the world. By all accounts the dude is locked up in his ranch in Wyoming working on nothing but this and I think he sees this as the ultimate opportunity to prove all his doubters wrong, if he can resurrect The Gap he can do anything. I compare it to Tom Brady's Super Bowl with the Bucs. Don't you think he wanted that one a little more than his last few?

2021-04-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Fat Valuations and Tech Stocks Seen as at Risk in Biden Tax Plan Wall Street got its stimulus. Now it‚Äôs hearing about the bill. 

Aglow after trillions of dollars of government spending pushed markets to record after record in the first part of the year, securities professionals reacted cautiously to Joe Biden‚Äôs proposal to raise taxes on investing profits. Many counseled calm, pointing to the likelihood of long negotiations, while also noting the plan had the potential to provoke pre-emptive selling, cut stock valuations and slow down the rally in tech shares. 

Stocks buckled in the immediate aftermath of Bloomberg‚Äôs report that Biden plans to nearly double the capital gains rate on the wealthy, with the S&P 500 falling as much as 1.2%. Still, the decline was minor next to the index‚Äôs 85% return over the last 13 months, and most institutional investors said they‚Äôd wait to see how the bill progressed before doing anything rash. 

‚ÄúThe devil will be in the details. Will it be retroactive to Jan. 1 of this year and then you wouldn‚Äôt need to sell right away? Will it be the beginning of next year? That all begs the question, will it get passed?‚Äù said Chris Grisanti, chief equity strategist at MAI Capital Management. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of moving parts. One thing investors can be sure of is that taxes are going up and we have to at least partially pay for all the money we‚Äôve been spending on stimulus.‚Äù

So if the POTUS has any advisors worth their salt they will tell him that a a stock market collapse is inevitable during his presidency. If it is inevitable, the sooner it happens, the better. The more time passes from the collapse to the next election, the better for the Democratic party, and Biden himself. So it is his outmost interest to speed up the stock market collapse.

Visa and Mastercard are considered by many as very solid dependable blue chip, both paying dividends while having really good growth.

2021-04-23 09:00:13,stocks,"Yes, both of them are involved in fintech. Visa has acquired some fintech companies recently. I just think that PayPal and Square have bigger growth potential, although they are valued higher than them too. But V and MA do have great dividend growth."
2021-04-23 16:00:09,stocks,"Ex-visa employee here, visa is very much so a fintech company than a financial one. It's more than cards (the cards are really on the banks) , and really it's about its payment and authorization routing networks that's the money making factor. Before I left in 2015, they were talking about blockchain then and have already dipped their toes in it. Probably progressing wayy further along than that today, most likely to improve the authentication factor, reducing potential fraud and hence losses. I also saw an article somewhere recently about visa accepting crypto (can't recall which market or product)."

At this time I think I want to research more by myself instead of reading other's DDs. I see that SEC filings is one of the most important information available from each companies. After I looked into SEC website, I found out that there are so many forms. I'm just wondering, in general, which forms are the important ones. Or I supposed to just go through every single one of them?

&#x200B;

Thank you very much!"
2021-04-23 08:47:29,stocks,"**10-k (annual) and 10-Q (quarterly)**... a company is required to issue an 8-k ANY time there is something material, so there tends to be a lot. The other forms that can be helpful and have a lot of information are proxy statements (for annual shareholder votes or special votes (for merger approvals, etc)) ... Additionally, the **companies investor relations page** (just google company + investor relations) will have all of their filings listed as well as some press releases, slides and other material that is a little easier to sort through than SEC's website. 

Make sure to **read footnotes** and explanations and google any terms you don't understand! If you focus on anything focus on the **management discussions** because they talk about what they think is important for that period and will sometimes give you a sense of what they're expecting going forward.   


[Here is a list/explanation of all SEC forms](https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/forms/edgform.pdf)

2021-04-23 08:09:19,stocks,The quarterly 10-k is very helpful for short term health and the annual report is helpful to find long term health. The insider trading report is also important to find out if upper management has faith in the company. Not every company has all of these in file but most have at least 2.

You may also notice that countries such as Australia export primarily to Asia nowadays. I am not sure if [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Australia) and [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Poland) count as ""butt fvck countries"" in your book."

True diversification does indeed limit your losses if you diversify into many asset classes, not just equities. And if you read OP's post, OP believes valuations are high and wants to diversify."

You diversify both on the way up and on the way down.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

When I'm supposed to be working, I'm secretly watching a stock ticker. When I'm supposed to be spending time with my family, I'm secretly checking market news. And when I'm lying in bed with my wife, I have my phone on so that I can see how futures are reacting to resistance and support lines.

I think about stocks *all the time*. 

It's getting a little unhealthy.

Thanks to everyone who read my forecasts and shared their own insights.

I think the urban sprawl and growth of Suburban  freeway access road Shopping Utopia s over built in some marketplaces  to keep up with competition .. Toys R us will probably close low traffic  non profiting stores, and revamp successful store s and regroup margins  then reprioritize where and how  they decide to build a new store..Then  they will reevaluate what inventory moves, vs what sits and liquidates.  SHELVES need to be full of merchandise that moves.. especially the  profitable ones..

>Yes,  Toy R Us is in a tough situation, but who are the ""sources""? Don't rule  out that they could be short sellers who are willing to squeeze the  last breath out of the company and all of its stake holders for their  own personal gain.

Edit:

For anyone interested why I'm posting this ancient history its because I wanted to find out what happened to Mattel share price. Mattel was chugging along but then Toys R Us went into BK and Mattel just unwound. They posted dreadful earnings and suspended dividend which just killed their share price. Hasbro tried to buy them out but Mattel rebuffed their approach (which was a big mistake I think). In any case Hasbro did quite well and Mattel is still shit company. Oh and they have never restored their dividend. RIP people who bought those Mattel dips."

2021-04-23 07:01:40,stocks,"I strongly recommend a look at Pins. My quick pre-work DD.

Check the run it had coming out of the March tech correction. Something like a $65 to $90+ run in less than three weeks? I was heavier on Etsy at the time and kinda surprised how much faster and stronger Pins bounced back from the March correction.

I managed to dump the rest of my cash into Pins yesterday 20 minutes before 1 pm lol and then had like a -5% swing on my portfolio going to 4. Pins is already back up above where I bought yesterday though thanks to Snap's earnings.

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PINS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PINS)

Why was Pins back at almost $70 again? Why was I so comfortable going heavy into it yesterday afternoon? You can see how quickly it lost most of the April recovery's gains, getting hit worse than most growth/tech stocks. It got hammered extra hard the last 7-10 days or so because one seemingly (to me) random analyst put out piece attacking their books which caused them an 11% drop in one day. A different analyst immediately defended them and basically said their books were even stronger than he expected:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinterest-tumbles-most-six-weeks-143556364.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinterest-tumbles-most-six-weeks-143556364.html)

Bottom line to me is Pins already bounced back from yesterday's sell due thanks to Snap earnings, that after we were given a recent buy opportunity by one analyst that I saw some speculate as artificially created, and even if it doesn't run to $90 in two weeks again I would feel pretty damn safe recommending you look into this stock."

It is reassuring whenever I see things go slightly red after the market closes. And also makes me not get excited when stocks tend to trend upwards during pre market too.

Heck I even will see spikes AH after good earnings get wiped away when the market opens."

2021-04-23 12:07:23,stocks,"I'm sure it differs for everyone, but what % drop do you all wait for before you consider averaging down on something that's more likely to be a short term hold or a stock you're just not in love with that's just a cash play?

Example that has come and gone with one of my first buys: I got in at $39, averaged down at $37.50 (was very new to this) and then a little more at 35 to end up with a 37.10 average. ended up kicking myself for not waiting to see if it got closer to 35ish aka 10% drop before first thinking of buying back in. But 10% is not a normal drop so I'm wondering if more like 7.5% and re evaluate? (Hindsight always 20\20 in that it went to 33 but that was less than it's 52 week low so don't begrudge myself for not calling that)"

S&P500 was $1,123 in 2011. It is $4,184 now. So at some point it's been at each dollar amount in between. Does that mean it's had 3,061 (4,184-1,123) all time highs since 2011?"

Company should be valued around $2-3B if you consider the valuations of their competitors, but it‚Äôs sitting at $500M. Great hidden gem.

You can search some DD on this subreddit for more info, although it might be a bit outdated. 40% of my portfolio is in $PERI right now as I expect them to pop in the next week. Maybe even 2-5x in value by EoY."

2021-04-23 19:20:39,stocks,".IXIC led the Nasdaq-100 for 3 straight days for a change performance wise. My eyes must be deceiving me.

If they're not, then I don't think smaller Nasdaq stocks waking up is a sign of its uptrend stopping (not that it even needs them to have it going because the Nasdaq-100 can drive things here). Since this worked last time (but it was commentary with the Nasdaq-100), we will need to watch how .IXIC behaves over 14.1k, as that's near the highest it has ever traded. If it gets there soon and then rejects, then that will likely solidify rangebound trading at best for a while."

2021-04-23 10:14:14,stocks,"Long term hold. I think the US will push for domestic production of chips and Intel is well geared for that. They did fall asleep at the steering wheel letting AMD and Apple get a good jump but they have a massive war chest, a new CEO and are probably R&D'ing like crazy atm. With the vertical integration of design+fab and massive undervaluation in terms of tech companies (P/E of barely 11-12) it's an absolute bargain. The risk is that they become the next IBM but I find that highly unlikely.

Currently 2% of my portfolio but I've been adding in all these dips and my target is 8-10% of my portfolio for a 5-10 year hold. It's seldom we see these bargains in tech."

2021-04-23 13:47:19,stocks,"Not financial advice but that's basically what I did with VTI and SCHG. IMO QQQ has a high ER for what it offers (.20%) but VOOG is .10% and SCHG is .04% for essentially the same exposure to large cap growth companies (FAANG+M, TSLA, etc). I think your combo is a good idea though and will help manage some risk from your ark positions (personally my IRA is 35% VTI, 25% SCHG, 15%ARK(f,g,x)). The amount of VTI basically determines the amount of risk you're willing to take with your portfolio. The etfs subreddit also has a lot of discussion on this topic."
2021-04-23 17:00:21,stocks,"VO might be worthwhile to look into.  It's performed better than VPU in the YTD, 1YR, 5YR, 10YR and Overall returns.

was in the 70s, then popped after earnings into the 80s.

2021-04-23 13:01:29,stocks,"Why sell. What changed about the company from when you bought it?

I would argue that people selling based on stock price movements is one of the biggest mistakes. Unless of course you are a swing trader. But as a long term investor, the power of compounding by staying invested long term is insane. Everyone wants to lock-in profits. How many times do you think people have sold a position after it doubled just to see it run into a 7 bagger. 

Do not let short-term price action dictate how you feel about the company long term. Holding a great company and giving it time to compound is the way. Only sell if your bull thesis is no longer intact based on recent business developments."
2021-04-23 16:37:43,stocks,"Believe it or not CALX has been my best performance stock BY FAR. Mainly due to my luck in when I bought in. And because of that I've only bought more.

2021-04-23 14:01:27,stocks,"Intel has been swirling in negative Wall Street sentiment on the cusp of strong optimism for its domestic competitors, and also in light of setbacks for new developments in the recent past.

It has been said that the losers of today are often the winners of tomorrow. I'm betting on the loser."

2021-04-23 15:06:00,stocks,"For earnings, its more than just beating estimates. You have to beat estimate and outperform the previous Q1 AND beat all other estimates like revenue, etc for it to go up. Also if everyone is expecting it to go up, it will not jump as much, maybe 1-2% but for some reason everyone things the company is doing poorly and the market gets surpised, then it might jump 8% like SNAP today (in the early morning) and was then dump lol to 2-3%.

There was a post about intel earnings posted in /investing

With a quick glance at that post: revenue was down 1% yoy, gross margin down 3% yoy.

I knew they were going to drop but was not expecting 5% down geez. I think its because it was already close to all time high a couple of weeks ago. Also a lot of uncertainty with Intel going after 3nm chips, not everyone liking their tragectory."

2021-04-23 13:47:52,stocks,"If you can‚Äôt decide, ARKK is basically a mixture of all of them so I‚Äôd go with that. I think arkf and arkw have the most potential for short term (<5 years) returns as the ‚Äúdisruptive innovations‚Äù in these sectors are likely to make waves in the market sooner than the other sectors. One thing I like about arkw is it‚Äôs exposure to GBTC which I can‚Äôt buy on my own. Arkg and biotech in general are quite volatile. Arkq and arkx (especially x) are a little premature if you ask me and AI regulations are a consideration. One thing to consider is if you want a lot of, or any, exposure to Tesla, as that‚Äôs the largest holding in k, q and w. F and G don‚Äôt have any exposure to Tesla.

It‚Äôs important to know that all of ark‚Äôs investments are fairly volatile because the entire point is that they‚Äôre speculative. There‚Äôs been a lot of negative sentiment surrounding ark recently because they‚Äôre buying into a lot of stocks that are hyped up on Reddit and they haven‚Äôt been growing since the tech correction a couple of months ago.

But basically, take a look at the holdings in each fund, ask yourself if you want Tesla exposure, and decide from there."

2021-04-23 13:23:01,stocks,"I will look at the charts to see if I can identify areas of strong support and I'll plan my DCAs on those.  

For example, look at MU (micron technology). I started my position around 89 (which was too impatient of me).  I dca'd at 84.50 yesterday because that's where it found support at the end of March.  Next level will be 76 as that's where it found support at the end of Jan.  December support was around 70 so I'd consider it there too if it drops that far.

I start off by deciding the maximum amount that id be happy putting into the stock.  Then I start my initial position with 40% of that amount, then my first dca is 10%, 2nd is 20%, 3rd is 30%.  

I only dca into non-speculative companies with strong balance sheets and proven growth, ve careful dcaing into speculation."

They finally have a good CEO in Farley, who has already started trimming the fat (see: Brazil). Their Mustang Mach-E is getting RAVE reviews everywhere.

Transit vans make up nearly half of all commercial van sales in the United States. And as people gradually switch over to EV, they're going to want a Ford/GM/Tesla, not some stupid little startup that has been making cars for a year.

Plus, wouldn't it just encourage more long term holding of equities until the pendulum swings back and we get another GOP member in office and they will un due anything the previous administration does? 

Everyone is freaking out about proposed corporate tax up to 28% when it was higher when 45 took office."
2021-04-23 12:27:01,stocks,"The proposed 39.6% capital gains bracket is a marginal tax rate for yearly capital gains in excess of $1M. All capitals gains below 1 million would be taxed at the current rate. 

If you realized $2M in long term capital gains in a single year, the first $1M would be taxed at 20%, and the next million at 39.6%.  Your total tax rate on that $2 million in profit would be about 30%. 

Keep in mind that $2 million in capital gains in a year is a huge amount of money, more than the average American earns over an entire lifetime, and if you earned $2 million in a single year from actual work you'd pay a higher federal tax rate on that income.

Also keep in mind that the 39.6% proposed rate is somewhat unlikely to become law."

2021-04-23 17:16:37,stocks,Yea I've not tried them yet but Im interested in them because of the gains you can make. Perhaps just try some less volatile stocks. I think Tesla gets people because it's bouncing up and down at the moment. Maybe something with more of a predictable direction.
2021-04-23 17:49:51,stocks,"you can still trade options conservatively.

2021-04-23 06:22:44,stocks,I just read. I wonder how much runway it has.
2021-04-23 16:53:37,stocks,"Because the other 3 are too expensive IMO. Their upside is limited to speculation and their downside is a lot greater than INTC. And I don't really think AAPL is a fair comparison, here; they're both in tech but their subindustries are very different, and to that end AAPL is probably better valued than TSM and AMD. A better comparison would be NVDA and their multiples are sort of ridiculous. I should probably clarify that I don't think INTC's competitors are bad or not worth their salt; just that their prices are like asking if I'd rather buy a new Ford for 60k or a 2-year-old Toyota for 4k. Barring extenuating circumstances, I'd take the Toyota any day of the week."

2021-04-23 07:41:50,stocks,"Honestly the only change this will likely cause is the rich moving their money to where it needs to be long term. Children trusts potentially. For example, if you have ¬£100,000,000 currently in stocks you'll likely sell and move it into a family investment trust during the lower capital gains tax. You'll then repurchase the stocks within the investment trust, allowing your children to withdraw from the account in the future. If you keep a solid proportion as cash, they can withdraw tax free whilst the rest of the account grows through the investment stocks. The children will then potentially take the capital gains hit if they ever need to sell stocks to withdraw money, though this would probably be smaller than the ¬£100,000,000 taking the hit in its entirety. This also makes inheritance tax less of a pain in the ass in the UK.


Founders of companies may also sell off their shares whilst there is lower capital gains. 


At least this would be my UK view. Very few people will put their money elsewhere, those who can avoid tax likely do already. Real Estate is a hassle and not worth it unless you're going huge student renting level."
2021-04-23 07:18:00,stocks,So you're saying if you raise taxes on rich people they're not going to start stuffing it under their mattress?

All returns are cash on cash returns when you look at them rationally.

If you buy a stock where they pay dividends, then you get to keep more of the profit.

Yeah, sure, they‚Äôll capture some of that innovation. How big is their market? Maybe the size of California alone combined? China? Sure, they‚Äôll grow too, but they come with risks and their stock market isn‚Äôt exactly exploding lately.

The real increase will be somewhere in the middle of its insane historical low and this number that Biden‚Äôs team is looking at. The wealthy will continue to buy US stocks. They‚Äôll just have to live with only making a shit ton of money instead of massive shit ton of money."

Second off all, if you have 200M in stocks, why not just take out a loan against the value of your stocks at rock bottom rates (which you‚Äôll get bc of the value of the stocks), use that to buy whatever you want, and let the growth of your stocks compensate for loan interest, only paying it off once tax rates are at a low point? Or, since federal long term capital gains tax is currently bracketed based on income rather than gains and the lowest bracket is 0%, then just have zero salary, no short term capital gains, and only invest in companies that don‚Äôt pay dividends. 

Raising capital gains upper tax rate (this actually wouldn‚Äôt be even doing that, it‚Äôd just be creating a new fourth bracket so that the top bracket isn‚Äôt just 400K+ income) without addressing regulation of financial activity won‚Äôt really change much. And neither democrats nor republicans are addressing that cause ‚Äúwealth tax‚Äù and ‚Äúmr potato head‚Äù are more flashy for the two parties, respectively. And let‚Äôs not forget, this is Joe Biden we‚Äôre talking about - pretty much every progressive‚Äôs last choice in the primaries. After one of the tightest years for senate and house elections.

I would highly recommend giving it a try.  Pick a stock you wouldnt mind selling if it runs up 5-10% in a month and pick a strike around those levels.  At the very worst, the stock will run up a ton and you will be forced to sell and you keep your premium.

Also US is top dog because US had been consistantly doing tax cuts and de regulations or low interest rate to favor business growth, not anymore if tax hike will pass.

I'm trying to invest in the future of my nephew and niece. They're both 2 years old and I want to be able to set up a college fund of sorts for them. I'm 27 and will be rid of student loans in the next couple of months. I can comfortably set aside $350-400 each month for this purpose and I plan to do so for as long as I am able to. I myself am new and don't have a lot invested but would like to start early on their behalf. 

What is the best strategy I could go for. I plan to cost average on a monthly basis. Should I go for standard ETFs like SPY, VTI or growth/tech like TSLA, AAPL, MSFT or maybe take the dividend route with O, T, SCHD, SPYD etc. ( I have very limited knowledge) 

I am pretty new to this whole scene (<3 months in) but I'd like to get something setup for them. Any tips would be helpful. Am I doing this too early? What factors should I consider? Should I setup a good portfolio myself and then focus on theirs? 

The other option I have is setup a govt controlled savings scheme in my home country. I can invest a max of around 2000$ every year in their account = 4000$ total. This savings will grow at <6% each year and will compound itself and is tax free during withdrawal (after 15 years+) . But I doubt it will beat the S&P 500 over a 15-20 year period considering inflation of my home currency and the interest rate is bound to change at any time. So I'd much rather have the investment in USD.

When I was little, my parents were really struggling, and every dollar was stretched.  My father started a credit union account for me.  When I turned 18 he turned it over to me with $1000.  And with it was the lesson that if you spend it, it will be gone.  If you use it as collateral and leverage, you can build your credit rating and understand how to use money responsibly, for life.

I used that thousand to borrow $1800.  I bought a brand new 650 Yamaha motorcycle, and worked a year to pay it off.  Then, I packed it up and spent 2.5 years traveling around the US, working and evaluating life.  Learned to ski well, lived near wine country, did shit I learned I didn't want to be stuck doing for a job.  That bootstrap account changed my life in many, many ways, all of which drove the next 30+ years of my development.

I decided to do an experiment for the grand kids.  Start young, and see what market compounding will do.  Not expecting to put a lot of supplementary influx, but I want to see the growth over 18 years.  I used the UTMA Gift option in my investment account, creating new accounts for them under their names,  transferrable on my death as the administrator or delivered to them on their majority.

I've read a few posts about this industry, and a lot of people are saying that if you're not invested yet, you've missed the boat.

I know it's been asked before, but it's always worth revisiting these things as stocks change all the time. What do people think these days?

ABNB, IAG are a couple I've looked at as possible options when the price is right. 

I've read that a lot of the post covid turnaround is already priced in, but there must be some companies where this isn't the case. (Yes I am fishing for stock tips in a sense, but aren't we all). I'm invested in Disney because of the parks reopening, which I am surprised most people think is not yet priced in, so there's one example."
2021-04-23 05:01:17,stocks,"DIS was flirting with ATH few weeks ago, their valuation right now is higher than pre covid, SIX and SEAS are also higher than pre covid with FUN not too far I think all park are priced in with future earning too, as some analyst expect them to have one of their best year after reopening and travel still being sluggish.

Now DIS have disney+ that can give room to growth past 200, I guess investor are careful with the subscriber number because for now we don't know if the fall in NFLX number is just them loosing ground or a general trend in people using less streaming services"
2021-04-23 08:59:53,stocks,Cruise companies probably provide the best bargains because they're the only travel/tourism stocks that haven't recovered to pre-pandemic highs.  They are riskier of course.

Is it safer to buy right now or to wait for the dip (for any IPO)?"

UK based RPA software company Blue Prism  is trading at $1.7B compared to UiPath $37B. Blue Prism has $200M revenues compared to UiPath $600M granted they have half the revenue growth rate over the last year. If you want to invest in RPA software consider looking at this foreign listing as the CEO is considering a US listing. Also they have many great customers, some are the same as UiPath. They include Google, Microsoft, KPMG, EY, Daimler, Seimens, 3M, EBay, IBM, Accenture, Fidelity & RBC."

I third this, Blue Prism is also the pioneer of RPA. either UIPath is overvalued or Blue Prism in undervalued, probably because of low exposure to deep pocketed US investors. Given UIPath lofty valuation I'd say BP will list in US soon. They're trading OTC as of now $BPRMF."

Chart of the day : the percentage of Russell 2000 index members trading above their 50-day Moving Average fell below 40%, compared with about 80% for the S&P500, a smudge off a record gap.

It‚Äôs too early to tell whether this can morph into something larger, but previous instances have led to subsequent pressure on U.S. stocks

Such a selloff in the markets could also be attributed to Biden‚Äôs new tax plan, which will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%.

2021-04-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Roth IRA guidance Hey everyone. Been working my way towards a bogglehead-like investment future. So currently this is my situation.

Im 28 years old. Single (probs be married in under 2 years). She has 2 kids. I make about 50k after tax. Currently in grad school and will graduate in 4 years. Will be making >125k after that point. 

I already have my emergency fund set up. 

My employer does a 401k that matches 5% and i contribute 5% (note this is weekly cause im paid weekly). Also have about 13k sitting in a transamerican account from an old employer. 

Currently have a taxable investment account through webull (eventually going to transfer this to fidelity once it gets bigger). I hold 60% VTI, 20% QQQM, 20% SCHD. In about 3-5 years will decrease that to 70% VTI, 20% SCHD, 10% QQQM and plan to hold steady there. (Will possibly add VXUS in the future but thats been discussed and thats not my point of this post). The goal of my taxable account is in 15-20 years i will pay for my 2 kids colleges. (I contribute about $2k/ month sometimes more depending and once I graduate hope to increase that to $4-5k/ month). 

Anyways been doing a lot of reading about IRAs and wanna contribute to one but need some guidance. 

If I understand it correctly i can contribute $6k/ year and that will be taxed when i add it? I also understand that IF i ever needed the principle (6k/ year) i can withdrawl that tax free before 59.5 but can not touch the gains before then? Then once i hit 59.5 i can withdrawl the principle and gains tax free? 

In my case is does that make sense? To add the 6k to the roth IRA and then add the rest to my taxable account? 

I would most likely use fidelity for the roth. What funds are generally the most recommended for the roth? Seems like for this would want to mirror the total market (us/ intl.) Would i just buy into VT then? Is that how the roth funds work?

What am i missing here? What would i do differently? I am open for all suggestions."
2021-04-23 00:05:49,stocks,"Open up a Roth IRA, max that one first before you try to add to your Webull. I play it safe on my Roth, only have a total market index. I just keep adding and forget, also have a taxable account to trade here and there."
2021-04-23 00:07:36,stocks,"There's a lot to go over here so I'll answer the easy questions. Yes, you can contribute $6K to your Roth IRA every year. Your money that you will contribute to it has already BEEN taxed (the way you wrote it makes it seem like you think you will specifically be taxed when you add it). Yes, you can pull out your contributions (but not the gains) without penalty.

Regarding order of contributions: Yes, it's great that you are getting the full employer match for the 401K. Yes, I would then max out the Roth IRA. And after that, you can either contribute more to your 401K for the tax advantage (but keep in mind that money cannot be touched until 60) OR you can put it in a taxable account instead (the advantage there is you can pull out the money whenever)."
2021-04-23 00:10:29,stocks,"Yes on the Roth ..max it out each year at $6k.  You might be able to contribute to 2020 still and then do 2021 allocation.  (12k total).  Money gained is tax free and you can pull out after 59.5.     I know you can pull $10k total of your contributions back out for the purchase of a new home without penalty......not sure if you can pull out your contributions otherwise.

You can buy stocks..options..etc in Roth.  Cant be on margin though."
2021-04-23 03:12:17,stocks,"Follow up question. 

Can i hold FSKAX in both my taxable and roth? 

Is there any reason i would not want to do this? Keeping in mind eventually in the future i will begin pulling funds from the taxable accounts and still investing into both the roth and taxable in the same year. (Say withdrawl 5k for a car in March but adding $2000 in april to the account to invest) ."

I have a 401k that employer and i both pay 4% on (max employer match). But i also want to buy a house sometime in the next 2 years. 

I wanted to transfer my entire RH account to roth but that will involve alot of selling/capital gains taxes. Also Charles doesnt let me by fractional shares in spy/etfs while RH does and dollar cost averaging is my preferred method which becomes hard to do in there.

Im thinking maybe just take out 5k from RH, put it in the roth ira and turn on the robo advisor. Keep 5k in RH, then contribute 50/50 to each. But then im worried i might kick myself when tax time comes many years from now. Would appreciate anyones advise on this..."

2021-04-23 00:17:53,stocks,"Thank you. 

I was confused in the tax part. The way I read it was that ANY more put into a roth IRA would then be taxed. Thank you for clarifying. 

One more question... would there be an advantage to move my SCHD (Dividend etf) over to the ROTH? 

I think doing my matched 401k. Max the ROTH. And then add the rest to my taxable account (thats my kids college fund and first car fund which ill need in 20 years)."
2021-04-23 11:23:35,stocks,"Yes, you can hold FSKAX in both accounts. The taxable and Roth trade stocks/ETFs/Indexes the same way, the only major difference is the Roth IRA you don't get taxed on realized gains. As to your question about ""why I would not want to do this"" I think that is for you to answer. The most conservative (safest) way to invest is to just buy index funds/ETFs, so if you're looking for safe investing, what you're doing is good. If you want more high risk/high reward, you can pick your own individual stocks."

2021-04-23 00:39:56,stocks,"There are 2 ways to look at it. You can do frequent trading (higher risk/reward) because the gains are tax free. But if you blow up the account there‚Äôs no way to refill it, so many people play it safe."

2021-04-23 01:32:12,stocks,"No, thats been common misconception. I was working under the same assumption for quite sometime then actually looked it up and you can pull out principle at anytime no penalty."
2021-04-23 00:36:41,stocks,"Not to my knowledge. The contributions can be pulled out any time. The *earnings* you withdraw (under certain scenarios) are subject to tax or penalty IF your account is under 5 years. Now you got me questioning myself lol, so read this: https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-ira/withdrawal-rules"
2021-04-23 00:38:33,stocks,A really good potential scenario is that you CAN pull out up to $10K in *earnings* to use it for a new house if you‚Äôre a first time homebuyer. Whether that $10K would be taxed or not would depend on if your account is less than or over 5y/o.

2021-04-23 00:35:49,stocks,True but I plan to use this for their car and maybe an apartment. Plus if they do trade school or somehow get tons of scholarships i want the money to use for them for other purposes. Then whatever is left over i will turn into more retirement funds

For me I like the freedom of money. And plus if something absolutely unfortunate happened and i had to pull the money out for some sort of catastrophic emergency thats where id pull it from unfortunate. I do appreciate the tip tho!"

2021-04-23 00:37:07,stocks,"People seem to have this idea that startups and their founders won't be affected too much because they make hundreds of millions of dollars or billions.  Those are the lottery winners.  

The actual startup scene works like this: Three founders get angel financing and perhaps later money from a self-styled VC, one step up from angel financing.  They slave away for a few years.  The outcome of a successful endeavor is being acquired by a large company for $30MM.  That sounds like a lot but by this time the founders' ownership in the company is 15% each.  That is $4.5MM.  Long term taxes plus state taxes are \~$1.1MM, leaving $3.1MM for taking a huge risk, working seven days a week, and constantly thinking about the business' problem du jour when not working.

Under Biden's tax grab, the federal and state taxes total over 50%.  That leaves \~$2.25MM.  That is a radically different reward for the risk undertaken.  The reward goes from being marginally financially independent to retirement being set but you still need a job.  The whole equation of whether it is worth trying a startup changes.

That is the successful case.  That is not the typical venture that does not work out and the founders burn a huge amount of time and opportunity cost then crawl back into a corporate job while their former peers in that world have been promoted twice while they were gone."

* The 1993 Clinton Tax Increase was retroactive so I doubt the super-wealthy are panic selling to lock in a low cap gains tax rate at this moment

2021-04-23 00:30:36,stocks,"Biden's proposed 43% cap gains tax may be an opening position in a long negotiation process with Congress and the Senate.  It is unlikely that a rate that high will ultimately be made into law, but the rate is definitely going to go up.  Perhaps they will compromise at 30% or 35%?   That is just a guess, of course.  Any increase to cap gains rate will obviously reduce overall investment in the US, drive some capital overseas, and reduce US employment.  In other words, it's going to hurt."

Contrary to popular belief hedgefunds aren't intended to make you rich, they're intended to keep you rich."
2021-04-22 22:14:09,stocks,"I too would like to hear people‚Äôs thoughts on this. Not an experienced Reddit user, can someone please tell me if there is a follow button?

My best guess would be that‚Äôs a sign they think it‚Äôll go up, and that the problem with a bunch of little guys like us following suit is that we actually help pump the stock, and the hedge funds are the first to sell out for profit.

Don‚Äôt listen to me though, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about."
2021-04-22 22:14:25,stocks,"Well think of it this way, you see people buying a certain product. You say hey that looks nice to to buy. So you buy it, then someone sees you buy it and says hey that looks nice to buy. And boom you got a ongoing buying spree which with stocks shoots the price up and now they‚Äôve made money. Well to answer your question they believe the stock they are in is going to go up if they aren‚Äôt shorting(obviously). & or they see potential in the company with great financials and you know all the good stuff. With that being said there is inside trading also so eh could be anything really."
2021-04-23 00:45:22,stocks,I think generally it is a good sign. If you get enough you can call the stock the ‚ÄúHedge Fund Hotel‚Äù which is a funny moniker.
2021-04-22 22:20:16,stocks,"From my limited experience they buy a ton.  Wait for it to cool down, pump it up to crazy heights through every penny forum, then sell and short it on the way down.  I‚Äôve seen some good DD about how citadel did this to who knows how many pennies I‚Äôm January and February.  It‚Äôs easy money for them.  

If I see this I will buy, but sell on any type of down when it‚Äôs climbing fast.  Wait a few weeks and buy again if I like the company.  Because by then it‚Äôs usually back to where I originally bought."

Are you saying that every ""hedge fund"" always buys both directions every time they trade a stock? (i.e. they buy GME long and GME short). How does that work?"
2021-04-22 22:27:56,stocks,"I am fairly new to this reddit thing as well, don't know of a follow button (or the likes) but you can bookmark the thread to make it easier to get back to."
2021-04-22 22:22:16,stocks,Except they know if there is anything inside going on.  So they sell when they hit their target and short it back down to where they started.  They don‚Äôt care about any of these companies.  It‚Äôs easy money and a game.  Retail foots the bill.
2021-04-22 22:15:58,stocks,Good stuff. Ya basically just looking at it as another point to watch for. If it was a common thing to gage in a stock.
2021-04-23 00:08:56,stocks,This is straight from wsb who really have no clue how the stock market works
2021-04-23 08:43:45,stocks,Dude the hedge funds do NOT fuck with penny stocks they want to make money for their investors. They don‚Äôt make stupid decisions. You losing money is you making bad decisions. Don‚Äôt blame hedge funds because you bought terrible stocks.
2021-04-22 23:08:12,stocks,"Well, sure, that's the value proposition for the fund itself.

I more meant the value proposition they provide investors; lower gains in exchange for significantly less risk exposure."
2021-04-22 23:39:50,stocks,Alot of hedge funds employ an equity neutral strategy. That's when they buy an undervalued stock and simultaneously short sell an overvalued stocks in the same industry. This essentially eliminates any market or industry risk from their portfolio. They do this with multiple positions to diversify their holdings and what they're left with is a portfolio that will make money both in up and down markets. This is valuable because it provides an opportunity for wealthy investors to invest in a fund that is uncorrelated with any other asset class which helps improve their risk adjusted returns. It's all about reducing risk.
2021-04-22 22:25:54,stocks,I agree. But we‚Äôll honestly never know for sure unless were a hedge fund. Lol
2021-04-23 08:55:11,stocks,"I‚Äôve made a lot of money this year on pennies.  And yes, the hedge funds only care about making money.  If you think they only invest and don‚Äôt manipulate the market you are welcome to that opinion.  I‚Äôll keep reading SEC findings and following the patterns."
2021-04-22 22:40:43,stocks,"Except the DD I read that I can‚Äôt find again that had 10 examples of them doing exactly this in a month.  3 million shares that go up 200% x however many pennies they did it to.  Plus the shorts on the way down.  All backed up by SEC filings. 

Wish I could find that DD but can‚Äôt cross link into this Reddit anyways."
2021-04-23 09:39:46,stocks,I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt manipulate on a whole. They just don‚Äôt mess with penny stocks. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve made money on them. But most people won‚Äôt. And penny stocks are peanuts to hedge funds so they don‚Äôt mess with them. It‚Äôs high risk low reward.
2021-04-23 11:33:40,stocks,"If you have level 2 data go look at any of the pennies trading heavy today.  SRMX is an example.  MM bids and asks fill the board.  I agree historically they don‚Äôt mess with pennies.  They have been for the last 4 months.

I think it is because with enough shares they still make good money and there is way less oversight and regulation in OTC markets."
2021-04-23 00:00:00,stocks,"NVDA stock discussion. What‚Äôs your opinion ? Undervalued or overvalued? What do you think about the current stock valuation of NVDA? Assuming that they can‚Äôt close the deal with ARM. 

The P/E ratio is quite high. ( intel - 12.67, AMD- 38.31, Qualcomm -22.7) , I do understand that the P/E ratio isn‚Äôt everything but will NVDA be able to make 86x their current earnings ?  

I‚Äôve been reading up on their upcoming projects and partnerships on their website and Instagram and seems like the company for the future. (I hold 5 shares at 602$)                                                     

But! What‚Äôs your take on this Anons ?"
2021-04-22 22:10:26,stocks,"That's an incredibly high cost basis.
They announced a new CPU for servers. So that's priced in. I am not sure whether market has priced in the ARM deal falling out. For the stock to go higher, they would have to blowout the earnings completely and the expectations are already very high.
My personal opinion is, it's a bit frothy right now.
It moved to $460 just on fears of rising interest rates. So the downside might be substantial if some bad news breaks. If you are willing to hold 3-4 years it would recover but not sure about short term upside.."
2021-04-22 23:03:54,stocks,"I'd say it's pretty overvalued. But if I had it already I'd probably hold it and think about a near-term exit, maybe in the next few months. It could keep going up in the short term in this market but it's all speculation at this point."
2021-04-23 06:22:17,stocks,"AMD is the way better play imo - they took market share from Intel in the server business most likely (see Intel earnings yesterday) and are selling every SKU they have just as quickly as Nvidia

also, nvidia will not have a cpu before 2023 iirc"
2021-04-22 23:30:50,stocks,"my only concern is recent rize of AMD and their Radeon graphics card. if team red somehow manages to outperform Nvidia, that could be bad for them"
2021-04-22 22:07:51,stocks,"Tipranks Earnings SmartScore has NVDA at a 10/10.  So that's nothing to sneeze at.  

I can personally attest that it's basically impossible to pick up one of their cards... they sell as soon as they hit the market, and have been for months.  

I can't imagine how they won't kill on their earnings call with good expectations on the next quarter as they attempt to meet demand."

Look at them compared to the market, especially the print up demand for their products.  Look at the overall index fund for comparison against other investment opportunities.  Look at their price vs themselves in 2-5 years.

They are priced well at $500, appropriately at $600 and overvalued at $650 and higher.  

The market is swimming in liquidity currently and there is a shortage hurting them and their competitors.  Demand is pent up especially for those who would mine bitcoins.

2021-04-22 23:15:14,stocks,"Their forward pe is 39. So if they trade sideways for a year (I believe they should) and hit the growth expectations they will be trading at a more reasonable 39. For comparison AMD has a 31 forward pe. 
 
I was lucky enough to add to my position at 470 about a month ago, but I‚Äôm planning on waiting for a more reasonable fundamental buy point to add more. I believe everyone should have some exposure to them as a hold forever stock. So in that respect you can afford to overpay a little for them, but if you already have some exposure I‚Äôd put it in a slightly better priced company."
2021-04-23 04:46:02,stocks,"I can‚Äôt figure out how much their 97% market share in deep learning will translate to revenue. Does anyone have any idea?

Their chips are pretty much critical for all deep learning, and other up-and-coming tech such as AR/VR, gaming, etc. Not to forget their data centers, development of DPUs, and potential ARM deal. NVDA could be the ultimate pick&shovel play of the next decade.

If the ARM deal goes through, I think NVDA is a $1T company easily. But for now I‚Äôm just on the sidelines because I can‚Äôt figure out an evaluation."
2021-04-23 07:36:20,stocks,"I wouldn't be surprised to see a correction this year. But as you know, NVIDIA is a very strong company, so I think a correction is more likely because of money flowing out of the whole tech sector, or whole market, than anything NVIDIA specific (although high P/E growth stocks get hit harder in such times). But you could wait until after earnings 27 May for a clearer picture.

Ultimately, nobody has the answer you're looking for. Corrections are inevitable. Buy companies you believe in, diversify and DCA. You will win in the long run."
2021-04-23 10:51:12,stocks,"For the life of me, I cannot say why anyone would value them that high, that is > $600 when you have an ongoing chip shortage that has and will continue to impact their and their partners' ability to deliver significant qty's of graphics cards, professional cards and their chips on partner boards. Automakers are halting production everywhere because some silly bit of Silicon can't be shipped. So imagine how it is for Nvidia who's products are bascially 80% Silcon. 

You cannot legitly buy a moderately priced RTX card. That market is as overheated right now as most tech stocks are.

P/E north of 75 (it stands way over 80 right now @ $604, even for a ""high growth"" company, is suspicious to me. This level of P/E for a company the size of Nvidia? Not sure people who think that's OK have the same way of looking at valuations. It's OK if the company doesn't have sizable sales or is carrying lots of debt for accelerating their business. 

Yes, I know they are the magical unicorn, AI, Ray Tracing, Deep Learning and all that buzz - they got it all! But frankly... how much of that current price is hoping that the value they might generate with that catches up?

I am pretty sure the conviction on price will get turned around on just a bit of bad news. And when you hear about it you can be sure you'll be running for the exit the same as all the others."
2021-04-23 11:46:54,stocks,"Imo, Nvidia is a great pick, but look at the semiconductor market; there are shortages that will last for 1-3 years. So Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. will have lower sales than expected due to this shortage for a while. 

Based on the massive performance uplift in Nvidia's new 3XXX GPUs, I am bullish on them. Nvidia has continued to be the company for GPUs for consumers. OEMs and system integrators are scared of AMD for some reason, which helps Nvidia's (& Intel's) sales. 

Some bearish stuff would be Apple and AMD. AMD has almost caught up with Nvidia in the last 3 years, which means that AMD will be taking market share away in the GPU market. Apple's M1 chips are the best in the market for power efficiency and relative performance, so I'd expect Apple to gain market share through their hardware. 

I'm holding Nvidia, AMD, and Apple at fairly even amounts, mostly because I'm bullish on those consumer semiconductor manufacturers as a whole rather than 1 individual stock."
2021-04-22 22:44:23,stocks,Over valued. I would seriously wait until we have another market crash before I bought this. Like i‚Äôd wait years if that‚Äôs what it took.

2021-04-23 05:14:13,stocks,"They're incredibly expensive, but they also have a practical monopoly on AI training. It's not really even their products, AMD, Google, Tesla, Amazon do have somewhat comparable products and AMD might beat them in price/performance for gaming. None of that really matters due to the sheer market dominance Nvidia has.

People aren't really content with Nvidia having such dominance though, many don't like their prices and I think that is driving a lot of new competitors, but so far everyone has failed trying to compete with Nvidia. 8 out of the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world use Nvidia, 70% of new supercomputers use Nvidia, remember that GPU acceleration is only a subsection of supercomputers, some workloads only use CPU and Nvidia isn't even in that space, still they got 70% overall market share in supercomputers. These people are the ones who place one order for 10,000 GPUs for $15k a pop, just for one project or application.

[https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/)

That's like 3% of their quarterly revenue done in one order, there's a lot of business potential with AI popping up everywhere. OpenAI I think is making bank with GPT-3 and you got self driving starting to become really popular, companies and institutions are dying to order these 10,000 GPU systems from Nvidia.

Nvidia's gross margins are really ridiculous at +65%, and 41% operating margin is also crazy, their growth is crazy. In data center they grew 97%, over 5 years they're average growth in data center has been 82%, their revenue growth overall grew 61% Y/Y.

With the silicon shortage I think people have started to accept the higher prices for GPUs as well. On the silicon side, investment keeps increasing and there's a great roadmap for the next 5 years, generation performance increase will remain strong. Nvidia is spending $4 billion on R&D, 23% of net revenue which is another great long term sign, they really keep making great products. They got their co-founder as CEO Jensen Huang, and he's got a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford.

Their stock price really is outrageous, but if there's one company who deserves it, it's Nvidia because they're doing everything right. I sold out of them when the arm deal seemed to stall out, but I think it's probably time to back in because people seem to have gotten over that."
2021-04-23 00:41:35,stocks,What is it that NVIDIA does more than AMD than the GPU market considering how much higher evaluation they have?
2021-04-22 22:58:59,stocks,u/Nimbus2000Flies I would also appreciate your thought on AMD too. I‚Äôve been buying up and holding AMD at an average of 81.5$
2021-04-23 03:04:20,stocks,"Peter Lynch's ""rule of thumb"" for high PEs is that if you expect the company to grow earnings at a greater percentage than the PE in the next 3-5 years, it might be a good idea.

For me the question is then, do we as investors think that NVDA's earnings will double in 3 years? if so, it is a FAIR price for the current valuation. If that growth is expected to continue, then yes, the price of the stock is worth it.

NVDA has a lot of demand for their products, which is great. However, I think that with a resurgent AMD I dont think NVDA can double its earnings in 3 years, depite the hype and despite noting for sure that yes, NVDA is a great company making a great product."

2021-04-23 11:31:45,stocks,True. I also have same thoughts. Very good company. Great products but stock price seems to have all the good news priced in. They will need to be incredible (to be honest they have been for the last 3 years) for stock to grow substantially
2021-04-22 23:09:38,stocks,"Personally I don't think the risk lies in Nvidia itself, but in the market at large. I think as a company it's doing all the right things. But if the market goes down hard, it's like they say: ""The bigger they are, the harder they fall."""

2021-04-22 23:45:10,stocks,"Factories were shut down because of Covid. Then everyone was home bored buying electronics to entertain themselves. 

Yes it‚Äôs damn near impossible to get an nvidia GPU right now and yes they sell as soon as they hit the shelves, but there‚Äôs less of them. Every step along the way of manufacturing these chips is being bottlenecked by the company before them. 

‚ÄúBut lower supply, higher demand, they can charge more for their chips.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm almost certain these companies have contracts with each other to buy materials and components from them at a certain price. Nvidia can‚Äôt charge more for their cards because AMD will step in and charge less like they did to intel with their CPUs. Capitalism. 

If I‚Äôm wrong about one thing it‚Äôs the contracts between companies where the companies in line selling parts and materials to other companies at a fixed rate. Which is even worse for nvidia because they would be paying more for products and having to sell them at or around the same price. Higher manufacturing costs and lower revenue due to less supply. 

I get the argument of higher demand higher price thing, but it‚Äôs just not how it works. Especially if the price has to stay the same and the demand is being caused by not having enough product to sell. 

Worst part is it will not end soon. Car lots aren‚Äôt empty because they‚Äôre selling out of cars. Graphics cards aren‚Äôt impossible to find because they‚Äôre sold out. It‚Äôs because they can‚Äôt make them."

Where pe of 10 describes 10 years for the company to earn the equivalent $ you invested with present earnings, a pe of75 would take 75 years unless it grows substantially. If it grows it's earnings even 30% per year, huge growth, sustained, the PE will only drop to about 20.

If nvdia does not grow 5x it's earnings the stock is too expensive right now relative to other stocks, save by paper value only. Aka, gambling on sentiment rather than returns.

2021-04-22 23:14:06,stocks,Very true. Could NVDA be the next Tesla with x1000 P/E ratio? No one can say for sure. But in this market it‚Äôs ridiculous how the stock prices are moving.
2021-04-23 07:20:32,stocks,"There's no forecast of exponential growth. I've read it's a demand issue. If the demand is temporary, it would be a bad move to scale up manufacturing. Anyway, they rely on fabricators who are at capacity and prioritise bigger customers."

CRWD, OKTA, ZS, TWLO for exposure to cloud and cyber security but there are so many good names in this sector. You could read about this industry for months and never reach a conclusion. 

FTCH and KSS for exposure to retail. 

FUBO has a fair shot if it can work it‚Äôs way into a sports betting/streaming service. Have to keep it on the watchlist and read all relevant news. Just a matter of time until online sports betting is legal nationwide.

2021-04-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Which is worse? Watching your gains evaporate, watching a stock run after selling or watching a stock run on your watchlist. Yes I know nobody can time the market. It doesn't mean it doesn't bother me! All of the above get under my skin. I think the worst for me has been watching the watchlist stocks run without me. I usually invest a lot of time researching before adding them there. I've resorted to buying a small part of my position right away and waiting for a lower price for the rest of it. 

Not taking the gains and watching it drop makes me feel like I was being too greedy. Not a good feeling. Stop losses at the target sell price are important. Setting a trailing stop 3 percent below the market price has helped me. A volatile stock would have a different percentage.

Watching the stock run after selling just sort of makes me laugh. Like watching your kid grow up and go to college. You appreciate the time you had and look forward to seeing what they become in the future."

2021-04-22 22:32:27,stocks,"It's just my opinion, but making sure all of your positions are long term holds that you have confidence in will prevent you from ever feeling any of this. If you plan to hold a position for years, what it does today or tomorrow doesn't matter. If you're using a taxable account, it's also smart to wait to take any gains before they're long term.

I think it's better and less stressful to judge performance by years, not days. If you're holding long term, you'll also be less likely to move to something else only to watch it rise after you sold it."

And I'll mean it.

It's when I get out of a position that I'm in, or I'm watching a potential play that I'm thinking about but at the last second pass on, *and then it shoots up in the following weeks*, that's when I get upset. Goddamn I hate that.

It's like if I'm stubborn and lose, then in my mind I stuck to my guns and that's not a bad thing. If I get cold feet and I change the plan *and then* lose, it's a disaster."

Though watching gains evaporate on short\speculative holds truly blows as well, especially for a smaller cash trader like me. I have a certain % for just buying things that get knocked down for no particular reason to flip back once they recover. Setting a limit sell right away has helped with that after I rode prpl from $25 to 32 to 27 back to 33. Took an extra few weeks for something that's usually a 1 week hold. I'm sure I'll be officially bag holding on something that won't be poised to recover in the future and I'll change my tune then."

If it‚Äôs running on my watchlist, there‚Äôs a very high likelihood I‚Äôll buy in at the top and hold the bag indefinitely. If it runs after I made gains, oh well, I guess I didn‚Äôt make quite as much as I could have.

They were all large companies that I had a lot of trust in, and they were all near decade lows due to broad negative sentiment around them at the time.

Well, after making that list of stocks that I wanted, I came to the terrible realization that where I live the age of majority is 19, and no stock trading platforms that I could find allowed minors. So... I had to wait ~4 months until I turned 19.

In those 4 months, *every* single damn stock that I chose surged, all by at least half, a few almost doubling. So, I missed out on many thousands of dollars of gains just from a stupid age restriction. Still makes me mad to think about."

2021-04-22 23:52:27,stocks,"definitely one, and presumably most people here saw one today around 1pm when biden's capital gains hikes flipped the market.

was up around 2k earlier in the today, watched that turn into a $500 loss, was plus $500 with like 15 minutes left until market close then watched it slowly decay down to just +$100 when all was said and done.

given how the indexes all looked today, most people probably saw the same thing with whatever their relevant numbers were.

you probably have the 3 things listed from worst to best, because after watching gains evaporate, next worst would be watching a stock run after selling. (with watching a stock run that you never bought being the easiest to watch)"

Watching a stock go up after selling is the worst feeling, because selling is an active action on your part, so you feel directly responsible for losing money. 

Watching a stock run on your watch list isnt concerning at all. Odds are there is a good reason why I was hesitant to buy, and just because it ran up, doesnt mean your analysis that it's a risky buy was wrong."

2021-04-23 00:52:18,stocks,depends on the magnitude of the loss or gain--  do think posting online about companies online makes me more emotionally attached to my trades..  Would I have cut my losses with NEO if my fellow apes here not such good confirmation bias palls?  Gotta be on guard for group think --  Road Corning down from 27 to under $2 a share.  Bought at $19-- Could have sold for a gain but cuz I thought $7 down in 1 day was a bit much...  And it just trended down and down.  My wife has a CPA but she says she has never seen a  company do the books like she was taught in school.  So she isn't a fan of stocks.  Corning did eventually recover... But I traded out prior so I got it both ways on that stock so that may be the worst... And my profilo(sp so far off spell check isn't helpin) is big enough that my watch list is usually things I have buy orders on...  Had a buy order on DRN and it didn't trend down that low.  And I keep watching it rally.  Did the same thing with industrials.  Tried to be patient but instead of trending down to my patent entry it been trending up and up...  But don't feel bad for me I'm up 73% from a year ago...

I don't get upset if a stock runs after I take profit. I have my profit. I'm not after every pixel of bar. I just want gains.  

I don't get upset if a stock runs on my watchlist. That is a learning opportunity and it didn't cost a dime!"
2021-04-23 06:41:34,stocks,"The watchlist ones are the worst for me... I did some DD, I compared taking a position in terms of my overall portfolio etc and then didn't pull the trigger for whatever reason (time, money tied up in other investments, etc). 

To see the WL picks run and not be part of it, after having done the homework... That's worse than the other scenarios, because watching gains disappear is unavoidable and may be temporary. 

A stock running, after selling, is always a possibility but if you have made the decision to sell based on your own criteria (take profits, use the cash for other opportunities, etc) then you were still the person makings the decision.

But like all things in life, you regret the chances you didn't take!"

2021-04-23 07:16:33,stocks,Missing out always hits harder for me. Seeing my gains tank is a walk in the park compared to seeing something I held at some point suddenly rocket. It makes zero sense but that‚Äôs my emotions!
2021-04-23 07:24:10,stocks,I bought 4/16 $9 GME calls in September because their stock normally rose during new console release dates( new Xbox was being released in November) and sold them when the stock hit $15. Obviously kicking myself now. But the gains are good at that point.

2021-04-23 07:28:37,stocks,After I sell I take it off my list. I try not to aid my sellers remorse. I may put it back on my watch list but I try to wait a week or two before that.

2021-04-23 07:32:40,stocks,"Out of the 3, probably watching a stock run on your watchlist, but even then for me I still see that as a plus because I can try to figure out why it went up by doing research or using Sutton's law. I guess the bad part of it is FOMO but I'm not a smart guy so I'll gladly wait or buy an ETF."
2021-04-23 07:38:40,stocks,"I can't stand it when I lose gains because I didn't sell/was too greedy. I believe this is mainly because I can only really blame myself in those instances. Makes me feel like a greedy idiot. Just stupid.

A stock that runs after I've just sold I often see as bad luck. Mainly I've got good reasons to get out, so I never really regret this one actually. Also I can still feel glad for the folks that didn't sell when this happens. The fact that there are still winners that were on the same side as I was sort of makes me feel better, idk why. (Maybe it's also in part because I can say to myself: See? I'm not a complete idiot for liking this stock. I'm just a complete idiot for selling it too early.)

Not buying in before it goes up isn't nice, but this happened so often by now I'm kinda used to it, and I know another opportunity will come by. Also I don't have a lot of stocks on my whatchlist. Mainly I either buy if I like it, or don't if I dislike it. I rarely follow a stock for a longer period of time before I make my move. Edit: Another thing that makes this one more bearable is that I know from experience that chasing a stock is one of the worst things to do. I made my largest losses doing this. Once the ship has sailed, it has sailed. Don't go swimming after it, you'll never catch up. Just wait for the next one."

Now I just shrug my shoulders and close my port app.  look back every so often.  It hovers at 25-40% down as of now.  I just put it in a small box close it and check for a run.  It may be months, it may be years.  Learning to remove my emotions was tough.  I remember waking up at night freaking out.  Glad that does not happen anymore."

2021-04-23 09:24:54,stocks,"I find that the ""immediately buy a small fraction of any remotely interesting stock"" is a great way to overcome the psychological challenges of regret if it goes up, at least for me. Even the tiniest amount is to ""feel good"" about it going up while also having a great opportunity to buy in further if it goes down (and I conclude that I should be buying more). 

Also, it helps me check myself on some hindsight bias. Sometimes I'm like ""damn, why didn't I buy that?!"" when something random goes up even though there was no realistic timeline where I would have bought it. The fact that I don't even own a fraction of it is a reminder that I had absolutely no interest in buying it at the time and not feel regret over an alternate universe that doesn't exist."

2021-04-23 09:44:57,stocks,"I agree with seeing it soar after selling. I usually decide that I‚Äôd be more upset if I missed selling and it went down instead of getting a profit and then seeing it could have been more.

I had this happen a few weeks ago. I bought a stock I knew nothing about just based on the numbers. It had low RSI, negative P/E, and some other good indicators. I bought it at $4.47 and it shot up to $5.80 within a few days, it even hit $6 briefly. Then RSI got really high, other indicators made it seem like it might be heading back down, so I sold at $5.77, a pretty nice profit.

Right now the stock is slightly over $7! lol

But like I said, I would have been way more pissed at myself if it had fallen all the way back to $4.50 if I missed selling it in the high $5 range, so not that upset that it went the other direction."

2021-04-23 11:03:58,stocks,Gains evaporate. I watched 3 weeks of work melt within this week alone. Feels like death.
2021-04-23 11:05:39,stocks,Stock on watchlist for weeks exploding after I needed it to fall some 1-5 percent more to buy in
2021-04-23 11:08:01,stocks,ASML came on my radar recently at $575. Been watching it run to $665. O well.
2021-04-23 11:09:13,stocks,">Yes I know nobody can time the market. It doesn't mean it doesn't bother me! 

You're taking this as something that's just inevitable, but I gotta say: work on your psychology. This shouldn't bother you. The answer to your question should be obvious by a wide margin : the only one that actually is bad is the case where you actually lost money.

If the others actually bother you, you're 100% going to end up trading with your emotions and losing more money. Don't ignore psychology, it's like 80% of trading."
2021-04-23 11:10:43,stocks,"for me it is when I don't listen to myself. I have a plan, someone says something that convinces me to change my mind temporarily, and then I miss a window of opportunity I had seen."
2021-04-23 11:11:16,stocks,Once I sell I remove it from my watchlist. It's like not deleting an ex from social media. Why torture yourself like that?
2021-04-23 11:12:56,stocks,"Same. But for me it's watching a stock run not just on my watchlist, but also when I set a low limit order that's now out of reach. That's when I always make stupid decisions and end up FOMO'ing in...then Immediately, or within two days it drops below what I set my original limit order for. Now that CRUSHES me. Usually when I sell, I'm either taking gains or moving the money to a different account or security, so that doesn't really bother me. I'm long on almost all my holdings, so watching gains evaporate in the short term doesn't really bother me either."
2021-04-23 11:17:58,stocks,"When you sell and the next day someone releases a target double what the stock price is at.

Fuck you @fisker"
2021-04-23 11:27:07,stocks,"When I‚Äôve been watching it for a while and I‚Äôm sure it will dip soon and plan to buy the dip. Keeps rising. Tired of waiting, fomo. Buy and it dips straight after. Even if it recovers, it bothers we that I could‚Äôve entered at a lower price."
2021-04-23 11:27:25,stocks,Watching a stock run after you took shitty profits
2021-04-23 11:27:45,stocks,"Id say watch your gains evaporate is the worst feelings. Feeds into loss aversion, no one wants to lose, and it‚Äôs not just financially. When you start losing gains it‚Äôs like watching your confidence on the trade fade away too, so you feel more fearful. I think that‚Äôs the most dangerous emotion in terms of trading, going from greedy to fearful. 
If a stock runs after I sell, it sucks, but at least I likely took profits in green, just not MORE green. Made money at least. While if a chart I‚Äôve been watching runs without me is totally fine. I know I‚Äôm watching the right charts for the right move, so keep up the good work."
2021-04-23 11:28:22,stocks,I'm a very new investor. I don't really know how to figure out what a good price for stocks are. How can I figure that out. I have one that I'm have so far made money in but I haven't sold. The others are just kind of right about where I bought them. Anyways I've been going back and forth on if I should sell now because I've made money or wait. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I've been watching as many videos over the last year as I can and taking notes. I know more than I did last year but definitely don't know enough.
2021-04-23 11:35:01,stocks,Watching a stick run after selling !!
2021-04-23 11:37:56,stocks,"Losing value is always worse than missed-out-on-gains. Nobody‚Äôs psychic so I can forgive myself pretty easily for missing out on gains. But if I‚Äôm stupid and don‚Äôt sell in time and my gains evaporate, that‚Äôs my fault for being too risky"
2021-04-23 11:40:00,stocks,Sell then run...almost always gets people to fomo back in and by then you end up buying at the top and sell the second it starts coming back down. Pretty sure robinhood made a whole business around this concept
2021-04-23 11:41:41,stocks,"Run after selling for me. If I'm long on something, gains evaporate into average price per share lowering buying opportunities and seeing something I've been watching take off is nice validation of my choice to pay attention to it at all..."
2021-04-23 11:42:27,stocks,"For me, it‚Äôs holding foreverrrrr and finally selling because ‚Äúeh I still made profit‚Äù and then it bust. I did it with both SLCA & TEVA.."
2021-04-23 11:47:33,stocks,Run after selling.

2021-04-23 11:52:19,stocks,Run after selling; because that usually happens after watching my gains evaporate.
2021-04-23 11:54:13,stocks,Yes.
2021-04-23 11:55:54,stocks,I would have to say watching a stock run after selling especially if you sold at a loss to recoup it elsewhere in a ‚Äúbetter play‚Äù
2021-04-23 11:56:02,stocks,All are toxic why focus on this
2021-04-23 12:02:28,stocks,Not having enough to buy in knowing it will run
2021-04-23 12:03:17,stocks,I have had every one of these happen at least once or twice and all equally suck. I just move onto the next one usually but get those moments of shitty reminders even a couple years down the road from a couple

2021-04-23 12:09:55,stocks,ISRG was my biggest miss. It still hurts some 15 or 17 years later.
2021-04-23 12:11:35,stocks,Gains Evaporate. Totally. Most painful thing ever.
2021-04-23 12:12:42,stocks,"I've tried to avoid looking at them after I sell them. What's done is done. I'll kick myself a bit when I see a ticker in my watchlist go on a run.. Chipotle, damn it. But, I don't bother too much with it. However, here's what bugs me the most: when I invest and then the market tanks later in the day. Like yesterday! Or when I purchased CNK and then later in the day it tanked because HBO announced they would putting up their movies on their platform right away. Oh well."
2021-04-23 12:14:15,stocks,"What‚Äôs worse is absolutely having conviction in a stock while everyone else around you tells you you‚Äôre wrong and stupid for believing in it.  Takes big balls to keep believing.  But, then again, Millennials have been trained since the 90‚Äôs to not give a fuck about being a part of the heard."
2021-04-23 12:25:21,stocks,I think unrealized gains are the most painful. We're thought to buy and hold regardless of what happens. But it hurts when a stock is up a huge amount only to drop back down to near your entry point
2021-04-23 12:28:32,stocks,"The way I always look at it is im going to be pissed either way, If it goes up you will be pissed you didn't buy more, if it goes down you will be pissed you're losing money, if it stays the same you will be pissed it didn't go up. You gotta find investments that you get excited about if the price goes down and look at it as a buying opportunity and not worry about anything else."
2021-04-23 12:30:59,stocks,"Watching gains evaporate. I always say, FOMO is better than NOMO account."
2021-04-23 12:31:10,stocks,Watching a stock run after you sell
2021-04-23 12:31:28,stocks,"Remembering that your mouse was hovering over the buy button for 600 shares of Amazon in 1997... but then you changed your mind.

But that's not as bad as calling up your mother during the dot com bubble to tell her that it's time to sell her Cisco stock that you told her to buy in 1991 and cash in on her $43 million in gains, only to find out that she'd sold it years ago without telling you."
2021-04-23 12:34:06,stocks,D. All of the above
2021-04-23 12:34:58,stocks,Losses hurt me more mentally then missed gains.
2021-04-23 12:39:39,stocks,"I've been trying to get better at finding entry and exit points. It makes it easier to be patient and not be care so much what the stock is currently doing. If it runs without hitting your entry point, then it's very possible it is overvalued and you could be chasing the bag if you don't follow your target entry."
2021-04-23 12:41:53,stocks,"Evaporating gains from experience. 

Reminds me of the cotton candy meme"
2021-04-23 12:43:22,stocks,What‚Äôs a stock?
2021-04-23 12:44:57,stocks,"A couple weeks ago I bought PLBY on a whim at $20.  It dropped to like 15 and I was bagholding for a bit, then I sold it for like a $50 profit when it crossed $20 again because I figured I was stupid and impulsive and learned a lesson. It shot up immediately after I sold and is at $45 now.

Watching it run after you sold is pretty bad, so that's my answer."
2021-04-23 12:46:16,stocks,Sounds like a bad relationship with money
2021-04-23 12:47:27,stocks,"I watched my INTC 5/21 calls evaporate 50% of my gains for the year... This was when NVDA announced their Grace CPU. I should've sold sooner, but I kept holding onto it like an ape."
2021-04-23 12:54:47,stocks,Yes.
2021-04-23 12:54:50,stocks,Crazy how slow your gains build up and how fast they crash to the ground
2021-04-23 12:57:53,stocks,"Watching a stock run after selling is the worst! I Sold ABML 3 days ago after losing thousands, and now it's up 70%. I thought it would go down further."
2021-04-23 12:58:33,stocks,"It took years with me to get ok with the idea that yes I may sell now for my 20 to 30% gain and this may run later, but that is my strategy and I'm sticking to it. I think it is hard to take the emotion out of it. Once you do that and you can watch your various accounts move and really focus on your strategy it gets so much better. Great I sold and it's running, does this mean I need to catch that run or move on to the next thing that fits my strategy... Takes time, patience and maturity but you get there."
2021-04-23 13:04:15,stocks,The first. Always
2021-04-23 13:04:31,stocks,I'm more annoyed at gains on the watchlist. You're right and don't have the financial might to follow through. It's easier to swallow being wrong in the other two cases.
2021-04-23 13:07:20,stocks,Watching it run after you l close your position hurts man.
2021-04-23 13:10:54,stocks,Watch list
2021-04-23 13:12:42,stocks,Real gains are all that really matter. So gains evaporating is the right answer here. The other two are just FOMO and theoretical.
2021-04-23 13:16:08,stocks,No one can time the market.
2021-04-23 13:17:39,stocks,"Definitely watching gains evaporate. That ""What was I thinking!?"" Feeling of not selling when you knew you should sell and all of a sudden its tanking. It's your own fault and its just greed and it kills me when I do it to myself. I don't mind selling and it continuing to go up as long as I made a profit. It's a tactic I use when a stock has been in the red a lot. Watchlist only bugs me if it absolutely skyrockets and I chose a dud over it. ""So glad I invested in X to lose 12% in the last 3 months instead of investing in Y to gain 60!!!!!"""
2021-04-23 13:18:42,stocks,Yes
2021-04-23 13:19:12,stocks,No fomo.  Trade your plan.
2021-04-23 13:23:34,stocks,"None, because losses aren‚Äôt realized unless you sell. I just look at the three months and up graphs, best DD for almost any major stock is to buy and hold. üíé üôå until retirement. Oh the market tanked? Buy more."
2021-04-23 13:25:31,stocks,"Out of those three for me it's watching one run after I sold. If I didn't buy and it stays on my watchlist I probably didn't know enough yet, and that's ok I can live with that. If my gains get squeezed I'm still ok cause I made a go for it. But selling too early sucks."
2021-04-23 13:38:49,stocks,Definitely watching gains go away. The other 2 are not actual losses.
2021-04-23 13:40:32,stocks,"Only actual losses bother me.  There are literally 1000s of ‚Äúmissed opportunities‚Äù every day.  I chose not to invest in those, so I don‚Äôt let it bother me."
2021-04-23 13:45:20,stocks,Actually the worst for me is watching it tank a day or two after I bought it. Thankfully I can allow a couple of intended short positions to now be long. I hate to lose!
2021-04-23 13:45:39,stocks,Watching stocks take off when you have cash is the worst.  Everything else you do your best and understand you don't have control over it.
2021-04-23 13:55:53,stocks,The first because I don't pay attention to the second.
2021-04-23 13:56:39,stocks,Gain loss
2021-04-23 14:02:14,stocks,Good call. I think it‚Äôs a balance of all of it mixed . Just like everything els in life. Want it then have it then don‚Äôt then see it go you want it then it‚Äôs guessing and waiting and yup you want it after all. üòÇ
2021-04-23 14:09:50,stocks,"None of those really grinds my gears too much.

But watchlist runs probably the most feel bad. You do have to understand you can't catch them all, maybe appreciate all the watchlist tanks would give a more balanced view

Evaporating gains is another state of mind. You didnt win until you sell. Period. So many people sharing paper gains really sets an unhealthy expectation on trading performance. 

Post sell runs are annoying for sure, but personally I keep track to try to learn if I m selling wrong."
2021-04-23 14:12:24,stocks,No fomo everything is a learning lesson
2021-04-23 14:13:06,stocks,I sold Doge when it was at $0.07

2021-04-23 14:27:28,stocks,Your name got anything to do with this?
2021-04-23 14:33:15,stocks,Everything
2021-04-23 14:38:27,stocks,"gains evaporate is worse... but also knowing that the stock can hit those high levels is reassuring. 

my thought is, its better to miss out on winning money than losing actual money. if a stock runs up and you never had it, at least you‚Äôre not losing anything, just lost the opportunity"
2021-04-23 14:45:01,stocks,Muh gains!
2021-04-23 14:45:34,stocks,"Watching gains disappear is worse to me . Something taking off after you sell, indicated your first instinct was right..."
2021-04-23 14:52:25,stocks,"Evaporating gains doesn't bother me because if I'm still in it then I still have confidence in it long-term that it will recover and do well, so I'm probably taking this as an opportunity to buy more.

I don't keep a watch-list for stocks that I'm interested in because any time that I have interest in buying a stock, I at least start a small position in it so that I don't completely miss out if it does quickly rocket up. From there, if it goes down, I buy more and lower my cost average; if it goes up, at least I started a small position and am making some money off of it. So, I see it as win-win and therefore this one doesn't really bother much me either.

While I don't keep a watch-list for stocks that I want to buy, I actually do keep one watch-list which I call my ""Where are they now?"" watch-list to keep track of how all of the stocks that I previously sold are doing now. So, when I check this watch-list and see stocks that I previously sold went much higher after I sold, that bothers me the worst. Which is why I don't like to sell much unless I have strongly lost long-term confidence in a stock."
2021-04-23 15:05:47,stocks,"The biggest kick in the dick I've had was being right about a YOLO bet and robinhood not fuckin executing my trade.  

Stamps.com lost their contract with the post office. There were rumors leading up to the announcement, so I placed an order for 10 OTM puts.  
I got a notification that it went through and it popped up in my portfolio.  after market close got an email there was an error and my trade didn't go through.    I didnt see the email until it was too late.  Came back a couple days later and they announced they lost their contract.  The stock price dipped over $100/share that day, which would've been about $50k.  
Not as big of gain porn as some people post, but at the time, my portfolio was about 3k total, so it certainly would've been life changing."
2021-04-23 15:08:13,stocks,there will always be another one right around the corner. you can't win em all
2021-04-23 15:09:48,stocks,Watching a stonk on your watchlist run is the worst. I really beat myself up when that stuff happens. Then I fantasize about how much moolah i could have made buying the calls or puts on the stock. Makes me feel sick sometimesü§Æ
2021-04-23 15:12:59,stocks,Watching your gains evaporate. If you make a profit and it continues to run oh well you still made a profit. It‚Äôs better than chasing a loss trying to make it back by making more aggressive moves. In poker they call it on tilt.
2021-04-23 16:07:16,stocks,"I think watching your gains evaporate is objectively worse because you lost money that you ""had"" (paper gains so you sort of never really had it). But watching a stock make a huge run after selling hurts more psychologically in my opinion.

Tl;dr: they both suck."
2021-04-23 16:16:29,stocks,"#2 is the worst cause you can at least get some positive from the others. Watching a stock moon after selling, especially at a loss, is true pain and despair."
2021-04-23 17:04:10,stocks,Oh fuck I got Bingo on all three today!
2021-04-23 17:04:31,stocks,Yes

2021-04-23 18:24:12,stocks,"What is worse is being indecisive and not make a decision is the worst feeling no matter what the market does. Making the decision to participate to win or lose, the outcome will be what it is. I have lost some and made some and so far I have made more than I lost and when I look what I lost it was due to not making a decision and waiting the market does not wait for anyone"
2021-04-23 18:31:13,stocks,It depends if you sold the stock for profit or not. If you took profit and it takes off after selling that doesn't bother me. The worst feeling is always buying something that immediately tanks.
2021-04-23 18:46:54,stocks,"As the saying goes, Never let a winner turn into a loser.

Of the three issues you mentioned, that's the one that most bothers me.  There's always another trade, so I don't stress if I miss one.  And if I've sold too soon and the stock goes higher, well, there should be something to learn from that.

All of the trading axioms make perfect sense and sound simple enough, yet aren't always easy to abide."
2021-04-23 19:34:51,stocks,"Realized profit is always a win man.

That shouldn't be a worst option.

2021-04-22 22:52:23,stocks,This. Knowing that you could have made money if you cashed out your gains but watching those gains evaporate and instead turn to loss where you lose your initial investment. That's the worst because you're actually losing money (pure loss) vs. losing money you could have made (loss of potential profit)

2021-04-23 03:36:08,stocks,"1) Don't let tax issues affect your timing. Take your gains any time you can max. 

2) If you want some long-term strategy, choose a strong company that pays a good dividend. Then, sell call options for 1 year out at a reasonable profit. If the stock drops in value over time, at least you have the dividend and the options that will expire unexercised. That is a good point to add to your holdings if you believe in the company."

We haven't been able to get back there yet and been stuck in this downward wedge trend forever.  If hedgies been able to increase their capital over these few weeks as we suspect then the next margin call is guessed to be upwards of $700-$800+. Expect the same attempt when we get close to margin calling them again."

We can still live great lives, we can still help people. As long as we have enough money to be comfortable, the rest is icing.

There are countless moments every day when we could become bajillionaires if we had the right information, but ultimately we're not omniscient and we make mistakes when life changing amounts of money are flying around.

Even at the beginning people were saying hold if you can, but if it's life changing money then ""it's okay"" (as if anyone has a right to tell you what to do with your $) to sell. Now if you're not holding for $10k or $100k\share you're a paper handed loser. People are stupid.

2021-04-23 12:14:13,stocks,"Have *you* heard of the wash sale rule? All the wash sale rule does is move your cost basis for the purposes of preventing tax avoidance. If you sell, buy it back, and sell again there's no problems. I swear reddit treats the wash sale rule like it's some kind of fucking boogyman when it only really matters at the end of the year for most people"
2021-04-23 09:12:30,stocks,">don't sell and buy the same entity that's just stupid.

It's perfectly fine to sell and buy the same entity. I can daytrade 100 shares all day. Literally buy 100 and sell 100 every minute.

No one cares, wash sales don't matter in this situation. I'm not losing any money.

The issue is if you sell 100 shares at a loss, write it off as a loss on your taxes, then immediately buy back. Wash sales just prevent you from abusing the tax system."

2021-04-23 15:03:56,stocks,"That wasn't a standard trading halt, no, it was a liquidity crisis that got them grilled by Congress. A standard trading halt stops both purchases and sales, and usually doesn't last too long. They shut down purchases only while still allowing sales, and then short ladder attacks immediately tanked the price on extremely low volume."
2021-04-23 15:51:52,stocks,"How is that possible if they've been shorting it all along from $5+ and seem to be shorting it even today to keep downward pressure? I more suspect they've raised capital to keep this slow bleed going on a little longer, they only got it down to $40 and not for long."
2021-04-23 05:55:46,stocks,I effed up with GME too (although not with an utterly insane amount) and this is how I‚Äôve moved forward.

2021-04-23 00:35:12,stocks,"If they weren't already nearly half of my account in January I'd agree and told people as much (IIRC I said $560 was very tempting). My personal buy point is $500 right now since I don't like buying fractional shares and see more opportunity in 5g plays for the next few years.

If I followed my convictions starting in 2013 instead of doing the safe thing I'd probably be very wealthy today, but I have the cashflow now to do the safe thing AND put money behind my convictions so that's nice I guess."
2021-04-23 05:50:18,stocks,I sold at that plunge üòÇ
2021-04-23 09:39:45,stocks,"I'm easily able to see AMD at $120 to $150 in the next few years, but after about 2023-2024 things become MUCH more uncertain to me. 

FPGAs are going to become a much larger part of their business when Xilinx closes and I don't understand the value there in the same way I understood the value of their ATI buy and Project Fusion/APUs/HSA (which has mostly played out how I thought, but years later than hoped). TSMC's clear process lead may shrink significantly by 2024 if they're not the first to figure out GAAFETs and the feds are looking to pump billions into domestic semi manufacturing, which I agree with, but which hurts AMD's PR vs Intel. Finally I think that ARM and hyperscalers building their own SoCs or ASICs becomes more of a risk over time.

Between those things, the fact that I already have very large gains in AMD along with a high % of my portfolio in them, and the fact they pay no dividend I'm looking to reduce my holdings by 75-100% by 2024. The investment thesis for them is getting too hard for me to understand."
2021-04-23 06:57:54,stocks,"I just keep buying the dips, and it doesn't seem to help!"
2021-04-23 08:28:57,stocks,Looks like the rebalancing may give it life again. I sold at a 20% loss and boy am I glad I did. I might buy back in again now that it looks healthier though.
2021-04-23 16:21:55,stocks,"They'll keep capital to prevent being margined, but they keep shorting shares they don't own so its fake trading.  Market is affected because hedgies look like they're selling real shares. It'll stay until DTCC/SEC have rules to force them to prove the shares they have.  We hold until then."
2021-04-23 15:05:42,stocks,Cheers to that! You too!
2021-04-23 01:22:58,stocks,"If your trailing stop is set to 10%, but it opens 20% down, you don‚Äôt get the 10% price"
2021-04-23 06:21:05,stocks,"This. I was around in 2008 but had no available cash. It was constant heartburn seeing all the things on my watchlist drop to decades-long lows but having nothing to throw at them.

I learned my lesson, though. I have the cash now, but I'm so busy at work I maybe buy once a month after I set up my limit buys."

2021-04-23 08:29:27,stocks,Nothing wrong with making money
2021-04-23 10:33:14,stocks,You bring up some really good points for the landscape in a few years. I think up until 2023 they have a lot of room for growth but after that it is hard to say. I do however have strong faith in Dr. Su to steer AMD in the right direction. Last nights ER with INTC made me question the leadership ability at INTC. I think INTC has has become so big that it takes a really long time to correct the course on such a big ship. INTC isn't going anywhere though like a lot of people are saying. They will be back. I'm 50% in AMD and I hope to see them grow.

2021-04-23 16:26:19,stocks,"This roughly jives with my understanding, thanks. They're also building capital to pay interest on the borrowed shares they're shorting yeah? That bill must be getting rather large."

\-They have an offtake until 2024 with Shenghe Resources, which is partly controlled by the Chinese government.

\-Not enough in-house expertise in REE processing.

\-Tough environmental regulations could hamper them.

\-A few too many Wall Street types in their management. More focus on mining and engineering expertise in the management team would be more convincing.

\-Their communication style is strong on hype.

\-They could have competition from Lynas, which has two joint ventures  in Texas, one of which is partly funded by the DoD."

2021-04-22 20:55:11,stocks,"The only bear thesis is that they currently have the material processed in China (as all miners do). They're already working on a plan to use an existing facility three football fields in length to process in-house. 

They're profitable, they inherited equipment and one of the highest ore content mines in the world for pennies on the dollar, their supply is in high demand, they're in a commodity market which should do well in high inflation (if it comes), they are the ultimate green mining company (good luck getting approved in California). I'm sure I'm missing something. 

Long story short I'm very bullish and this is a long term buy and hold for me. I added another $500 worth of stock yesterday even though I'm maxed out. Tempted to go into margin for a bit more but I only do that if I'm planning on depositing within a few days.

EDIT: US based miners."
2021-04-22 23:50:01,stocks,"Been waiting to buy this for MONTHS lol. Jumped in small sub 35. Loaded up more at 30 - should have been a little more patient... Sold some CCs at 35 strike for about 160/contract so my avg price is around 29 right now. 

Sold some September CSPs at 30 strike as well. (630/contract premium) if they end up being assigned I'll be in at 23.70/avg for those shares. 

I don't see much of a bear thesis beyond CEO selling shares. The only other miner in the USA that will be entering REEs in the near term is UUUU but they should be very far ahead by that time. US market is cornered by MP right now.

The only thing I don't like is the 5B valuation is kinda high but it's forward thinking and they should grow into it fairly quickly. I be the US govt may provide some help to shore up its supply chains and MP may receive tailwind as a result of that."

Companies like MasterCard and Visa are essentially always going to be around (I work in payments and they are a puzzle that just doesn‚Äôt seem bearable). Or a company like FIS that is in the digital payments and banking space."

2021-04-23 00:00:00,stocks,"After 30 years, the Nikkei Japan Stock Market is still recovering after their crash, What are the chances it could happen to the US? From my understanding, Japan seems like an incredibly growing country, especially during that time, with all the tech, car companies, Nintendo, video games, food, culture, and everything innovative that was coming out of there. Supposedly, the reason the Japan Nikkei stock market crashed in the early 90s was because everything was ridiculously overvalued, at high PE Ratios.

Here in the US, we're now the country with lots of innovation, but we also saw multiple stocks rally up several folds last year, several with PE Ratios in the couple 100 to even over 1,000 range, like Tesla, Zoom, SQ, the 1st of which is inside many major index funds. Is there a difference between what we're going through and what Japan went through that time?

I'm actually genuinely wondering and asking, and I know with any post related to something more bearish, someone might get sensitive about it, so hopefully someone can openly explain it from the other side, thanks!"

2021-04-22 21:49:58,stocks,"Japanese assets haven't recovered 1990 prices for a few reasons:

1. Lack of innovation due to a passive culture. (People would rather get a ""safe"" job than start the next revolutionary EV company that could make billions)
2. Conservative approach to financial investments. (No one's going all in on the market to capitalize on some big opportunity, so prices aren't going up)
3. The 1990's was the ""peak"" of Japan. (They were really big. It felt like they were going to take over the world. But since then, there haven't been companies more successful than Toyota, Sony, etc. Add low immigration rate and declining birth rate to the mix. Now there aren't enough workers to replace older populations soon to retire, so Japan's GDP continues to fight to stay in the top 3)

It's mainly due to cultural reasons that Japan's economy ended up like that. Americans are too opportunistic to run into the same issue. If the stock market does collapse, it would be for different reasons than Japan."

2021-04-23 00:13:53,stocks," I do not believe this will happen to the US. The main reason is not due to culture, valuation of stocks, lack of innovation in Japan, or etc. Geopolitics played a huge role in the collapse in the financial system in Japan. Japan was crippled by the US during their trade war because they did not have a military to counteract the US forcing them to sign the Plaza Accord.

A few things to add that are very beneficial to the US:

1. Huge immigrant country which will always be a driver for strong talent in every sector.
2. Unparalleled soft power.
3. The ball has been rolling and some of the biggest companies in the world are from the US. I can only name a hand full of companies from the EU, Canada, Latin America, etc. Most of the companies the average person knows are from the US, Japan, or China."

2021-04-22 20:31:52,stocks,"You have a valid thought for sure. One of the big problems with Japan's economy at the time was the ""zombification"" of their financial system. Japan tried to bail out every big and failing institution much like the US in the GFC and Covid crisis. Now our system is flooded with weak companies carrying tons of debt and are eating up cash much longer they would in a more competitive environment. A small rise in interest rates would wipe most of these companies out.

The sad part of this is: the US does not seem to recognize that all these bailouts are keeping the economy from growing more rapidly, dynamically and evenly in the future.

Stock/debt/housing bubbles misdirect capital to a lot of people that are wasting it through fraud, speculation and recklessness.

Most investors probably don't recognize how weak some of their investments are or they probably don't care. The Fed is expected to give permanent support to badly adapted institutions."

It's central bank balance (Money creation) is not only frightening, it should give everyone some pause thinking the central bank can prop up a dead market.

To do stimulus will invite huge - skewed to the future - problems witch catching a currency devaluation (since Bretton Woods, but now accelerated) and the fringes can already be seen in USD and EUR markets. Add to that a black swan - ""Lockdowns because Covid"" political overreactions - and then put a long period of QE on top of what should have been a corrective recession and you get the perfect storm.

Japan is just a drawn-out-to-death version of this as it's an isolated region, has its own currency and adds a lot of demographic problems on top of that, with being an isolationistic region on top - ie. an overly aging society and GDP development are not set for solid growth."

2021-04-23 01:00:21,stocks,"This raises an interesting point. My understanding is the US state (as in government, not state in the US sense) pension system is weak to non-existent. But in effect, the US government is paying pensions through supporting the stock market. This raises the question, is it cheaper and more sustainable to support the stock market to fund pensions than it is to fund pensions in the more traditional European style?

A lot of people here may instinctively say supporting the market in this way is unsustainable, but given the pressures placed on 'traditional' pension systems by aging populations which are increasingly common across Europe, they appear unsustainable too. Given stock market funding comes largely from QE measures rather than taxation as in 'traditional' pensions, it may be difficult to compare though.

2021-04-23 15:25:29,stocks," 

There are a few factors that lead me to believe the steel industry is just getting started in a big way. First, obviously, is the reopening of economies across the globe post-pandemic. My dad heads the service department of a major construction company and the amount of work they have right now just delayed his retirement by two years.

Secondly, I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but our natural disaster rate has increased dramatically. Every time I turn around we're getting wrecked by another hurricane, massive fires, deep freezes in places not equipped for it, or tornadoes blowing through towns. After every disaster is another rebuild.

Third, the infrastructure bill...another obvious factor, but still a factor.

Fourth, steel price futures are at record highs even adjusting for inflation all the way through mid-2022 and unlike the stock market, it has been on a linear trajectory upward for nearly a year now. These prices are especially beneficial to companies like CLF and MT, which are vertically integrated. They don't have to buy their steel and re-sell it, they produce their own.

Fifth, there aren't any real risks to this industry. Look at your other industries.

Tech: semiconductor shortage lasting longer than expected, overvaluation, oversaturation.

Pharma: picking a winning pharma company is like trying to win the lottery (I have 30 shares of Moderna, but I didn't get in till they were at $100/share and it's come down to near my entry point three times already since I bought)

Banking: The rise of those other gimmicky currencies 

Real Estate: increasing interest rates, sky-high commodities prices (lumber, steel)

Cannabis: failure to pass federal legalization, longer than expected route to profitability, overcrowding of the sector.

Clean energy: I like this sector, but it is in a prolonged period of retraction, and I just don't know when it's going to turn around again. I got stop-lossed out of NIO, and I entered Li Auto at what I thought was the bottom ($25/share) only to be sitting at $20 now.

There is a great deal of risk in our current stock market, but much less in steel, in my humble opinion."

MT was able to shed a part of their business that they deemed the operating costs too high for the margins they made and got a nice lump of equity in exchange. CLF was able to acquire a large portion of the american steel market from MT's business and will be able to run it with much greater efficiency than MT could because of cost synergies with their existing US operations."

I honestly don't know wtf qualifies to you as a bullish sign educationalgrass.  I don't think you have actually done anything more than look at the chart and then offer generalizations and platitudes to try to naysay every positive factor brought up about CLF.

Personally, I don't have a stake in CLF, but after reading about what they have done in the last year, I am a fan.  They bought MT's USA operations at the perfect time last year, right before steel prices skyrocketed. Their projecting nearly 4 billion in revenue, have announced plans to be debt free within two years, initiated stock buybacks, and raised guidance twice already.

Do you know what a debt free dividend paying HIGHLY profitable company goes for in today's market?  Look around.  Because that's CLF in 6 months tops."

4 bil EBITDA for 2021 (again based on prices lower than steel futures, so that's conservative... And still half their current market cap lmao)

What it would impact is more demand for a longer period keeping the spot rate of steel higher. This is seen in the futures market. Many believe 4Q is when there will be a large fall off, but going into 1Q 2022 futures are already remaining at their high level. Check HRC futures. Separately for infrastructure there is some peculiar type of metal that only they create in the US that is needed for broadband which is part of the current proposed infrastructure plan.

As mentioned I sold my principal out still. I was a bit disappointed at the level of 1Q net income made on high HRC prices. The free cash flow will be huge as they pay down their large and expensive (as in APR%) debt, but I did expect a higher 1Q profit. Still own a couple thousand from locked in profits though in full disclosure"
2021-04-23 10:29:51,stocks,"Not sure what OP is talking about - NUE, STLD, and CLF are operating at max capacity as far as I can tell. STLD is bringing online additional 25% capacity over the next 6 months. CLF said they are operating above capacity on some lines.

The infra bill might bring in a \~10% tailwind (we calculated 5-10 million tons/year, see my post history) to steel demand in years 3-8 if passed as-is. I doubt it will pass as-is, so I suspect a much more modest increase in steel demand, and it will come online slowly. However, it might be the catalyst the industry needs to keep utilization high after some of the post-covid boom starts to equalize out.

Regardless, US production is just a drop in the bucket. MAYBE 100 million Tons. China is like 1 billion tons. They are the big swinging dick in the steel market.

China capacity is being hit due to the CCP cracking down on pollution and literally telling mills ""cut your production. we are checking."" As well, there is a rumored cut to the subsidies that Chinese mills get when they export steel (currently making Chinese steel 13% cheaper on the international marker). Chinese steel mills are mostly of a highly-polluting type called a Sinter plant. Read up on the Italian sinter plant that just recently MT divested from - literally an environmental disaster. American mills are significantly more advanced with significantly less pollution.

Definitely recommend listening to the CEO of CLF comments over the last few years about the direction of the steel biz. He has been eerily prescient."

But yeah I mean with financials like that, its a homerun. They went from being an iron ore miner (which is all they've ever been, and you saw the heights the stock went to) to now being the largest flat roll steel producer on the continent (after buying Arcellormittal NA and AK steel)

So you've got the biggest steel company in NA, supplying its own input, selling excess input to competition, projecting EBITDA (again, half of the company's market cap, and conservative to boot) and FCF at lower than market projection based on product output pricing and on top of all that, the underlying commodities (both HRC and Iron ore) are at all time highs.


It just felt like even a cursory glance at the financials from anyone immediately tells you ""home run.""


But you were talking about it as if it was bad along with not having looked into it yet.


Edit: and just as bonus info, the CEO said on yesterday's call they have 0 outstanding long term contracts, meaning every order is based on spot price, which is over $1500 right now (again, EBITDA and FCF are projected assuming only $1100) they could easily clear $5 bil EBITDA this year, and even at 4 bil, will go into 2022 as a steel company with only 1x (!!!) Leverage."

US Steel is like ~5% of the global market, China still about 50% last I checked. I saw the CEO *isn't* selling excess input to competition, since he now sees them as competition since the last acquisition. So it's great they vertically integrated, but one revenue stream has been cut off (If the news in ToS is correct) and I'm not convinced they have the capacity to fill enough of the current demand to justify the premium of the stock right now. 

I get it, the spot price is through the roof right now and the financials look good according to a few comments I got. OP requested constructive criticism, so I gave him a little bit. Not sure why people on these boards get so heated when someone ask OP to expand or defend their position. He mentioned the chart, so I commented on that. If he had included financials in the OP, that would have been better. I'll certainly dig a bit more into the balance sheet and put it on my watchlist, but let's all realize OP wanted this to be a discussion, not a circle jerk."

$10 up from $8 which is what it actually is from pre covid price is more than warranted based off of the spot prices alone... And they were much much MUCH lower (even though they were already really high!) Back in January when it had already hit $18, and has not seen a sustained movement upward since (while spots have) so nothing is priced in because the stock hasn't moved a leg up and stayed there since early January. 

So every bit of price jump in spot price since then has yet to make its way into the equity.


U.s. steel is a dramatically inferior company, and I'm not going to do your homework for you on the financials, but a Google search and 5 minutes of your time reading lets you know that. X is going to keep going up too (just due to industry environment), but clf will pass it quickly (I mean their forward looking balance sheet for 2022 compared to X... Lol)

And as far as China goes, I'm not going to assume you've been following the back and forth going on over there with their steel rebate cuts, but China Steel dumping is over and it isn't coming back."

Secondly, I was referring to total US steel production, not the company. I thought that was inferred when I mentioned China, but can see that could be easy to mistake. 

It's not attractive enough for me to do a deeper DD right now. They have to not dilute (they have),  capture a large portion of the new demand with their vertical integration (TBD, but possible), have macro tail winds and the spot price stays high, you probably can beat the market. If you get profits on this, take them early. This certainly doesn't look like a buy and hold forever play at this valuation to me.

2021-04-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Dividend stocks taxable? Growth stocks IRA? Is it better to put my dividend paying stocks in my ROTH and my growth ( low dividend) in taxable?

I don't have a huge portfolio right now so I'm not sure it matters much since I don't get a huge dividend even if a stock pays a high percentage."
2021-04-22 20:12:35,stocks,"This is ultimately up to the individual's preference and financial situation.

* Definitely agree that your dividend stocks should be inside a tax advantaged account such as your Roth IRA. This will not trigger a tax event when you receive dividends. But there's the limit of $6k/year max up until a certain income limit. If you want to invest more then the taxable account is an option.
* But if you're planning to use your dividend as income then having it in a taxable brokerage may be better as you can withdraw the money as income. Keep in mind you'll need to pay taxes on this similar to taxes you pay on your earned income.
* Most folks prefer growth stocks in taxable accounts because you only trigger capital gains/losses when you sell. Until then it is all unrealized.

Personally I have all index funds in both my Roth IRA and Roth 401(k). My taxable account only has several speculative index funds like ARK and individual growth stocks."
2021-04-22 20:08:27,stocks,"For growth depends on timeframe. If you‚Äôre not going to hold it for a while and potentially incur massive cap gains, Roth is best.

An IRA is what I use to *transfer and consolidate* old shelters. In another 20 years, taxes will be applied to the IRA as you withdraw, and they're unlikely to be low!"

As a result, they Hoover up assets. They can then charge a fat trading spread on those assets. Thus the bull case is that cryptos go mainstream, few other competitors come in, and margins stay fat. The bear case would be crypto dies along with other hype stocks (no one wants to own a Beanie Babies trading platform).

2021-04-22 22:40:07,stocks,"I‚Äôll take a shot.

Coinbase (CB) is the premier crypto exchange in the US. For newcomers to crypto, CB will most likely be the obvious place for them to buy ‚Äúreal‚Äù crypto. For people that get more serious about crypto, they‚Äôll probably use CB Pro which is connected to your CB account, offers lower fees and allows users to place limit orders. 

So as crypto gains more mainstream adoption, CB will gain the lion‚Äôs share of the new adopters and keep those users in the ecosystem with CB Pro. And most likely, BTC‚Äôs bull run will continue till later this year and approach or surpass $100k. That will likely spark major attention and a lot of speculative investment. 

Additionally, CB will be expanding to offer more services than an exchange. They already offer a digital wallet and will be offering BlockFi type interest accounts and lending. They‚Äôll pretty much be full service crypto bank."
2021-04-23 00:50:13,stocks,"I think another major oversight people are showing is that institutions use coinbase to buy and invest in crypto and they have an entire service dedicated to institutional customers. The company data shows that institutional investors using coinbase have outpaced retail for the last couple years. Institutional adoption and rapidly changing perspectives regarding the use cases for blockchain tokens across the financial sector means that crypto trade volume is not likely to go dormant in a down market. Coinbase also does not have to hit the top of their earnings projections to justify their valuation, their q1 2021 earnings are already enough to justify the multiple they are trading at. Take a look at companies like Sea Limited, Zoom or Snowflake, or even look at Amazon, Tesla, Google etc. All of these companies and many more popular names trade at far greater sales multiples than coinbase.

Some numbers:

$58 billion market cap as of close

I think if you invest in Coinbase you really think stuff like offering staking as a service will hit it big in the medium-long term, and then you'll see much higher yearly returns as Coinbase can get money from other revenue streams.

* Coinbase's revenue comes entirely from trading fees.  That means for them to continue growing revenue, they need more people trading crypto more often.
* The only reason to buy/trade crypto is if you think it will appreciate in price in the future.  But if the price continues to appreciate or fluctuate, that makes it impossible to use crypto as a currency.  This would significantly impair the use case for crypto, which in turn will kill the demand.
* If, however, the price of crypto eventually levels out so that it could be used as a currency, there's no reason to keep buying/trading it (or at least the volume of trading will drop considerably).
* Conclusion: Coinbase's model relies entirely on investors thinking crypto has the potential to become a legit currency (so there's sufficient demand for it) but never actually becoming one."

CFRA Research believes Coinbase could surge 22% to $400 per share over the next 12 months.
Analyst Chris Kuiper, CFA, says institutional investors will buoy shares of Coinbase moving forward.
CFRA sees the crypto exchange ending the year with earnings per share of $6.81.

Coinbase could surge 22% due to the growing ""cryptoeconomy"" and a push to lure in more institutional clientele, CFRA Research says.

In a note to clients on Friday, CFRA analysts led by Chris Kuiper, CFA, initiated coverage on shares of Coinbase with a ""buy"" rating and a $400 12-month price target.

The price target represents a potential ~22% jump from Monday's intraday low of $326 per share.

""Our base case scenario implies COIN not only becomes one of the largest financial exchanges for crypto but that it is also successful in diversifying into other products and services, most notably those aimed at institutional investors, an area it has more aggressively pursued over the past two years,"" Kuiper wrote.

Kuiper and his team also presented earnings per share estimates of $6.89 for 2021 and $3.00 for 2022 in their note to clients and said they see operating margins ramping and then stabilizing at 35%.

2021-04-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Webull P/L calculation So I spent a few day talking to Webull customer service on how they calculate P/L, because it didn't make sense to me, using one day of trading (4/19) for example.

4/19 - Sold 3 shares of GME for $170.00

4/15 - Bought the above shares for $164.50

P/L for 4/19 was $16.48 ($170.00 - $164.50 \* 3 - $0.02)

If I go into my stock P/L tab, I see the gain of $16.48, checks out. Where it gets weird to me is when I check my account performance. Setting the filter to custom for 4/19 it shows a gain of $45.91 for GME, which is clearly wrong.

What Webull is doing, and I admittedly am new to this so perhaps it is normal, is using the previous day closing price (GME closed at $154.69 on 4/16) compare to what I sold it at on 4/19 ($170.00) How in anyway is that an accurate representation what what actually happened in my account?

Here is the actual response from Webull:

*Sure.*

*510 (4/19 total sell price)-154.69 (4/16 close) \*3 (shares) -0.02 = 45.91 (p/l)*

*Sincerely, Webull¬†Financial¬†LLC*

So I ask my fellow Redditors, what the hell? Am I off base here or is this a extremely misleading way to report P/L? Any insight is truly appreciated because this is driving me nuts!"

I'm not interested in doing anything with Google, Microsoft, or Apple. I want to keep all these. My question is what should I do with my 1 Amazon. Obviously I can just keep it. After it fell $50 today and has fallen past days I'm not to far off my average cost again.

I'm interested in Nvidia so I could just sell Amazon and grab 5 nvidia to replace it with. I'm also interested in Tesla, so same thing. Could sell Amazon and grab 5 Tesla or something.

Like I said though I could just do nothing. I'm assuming Amazon has the possibility to hit $3500 to $4000 by the end of the year. It hasn't done much movement in the past 9 months though.

I'm not a newbie to this stock trading thing just wondering about opinions. 

1 Amazon, 5 Tesla, 5 Nvidia, X Shares of something else.

Huya is an online video game streaming service that is branching out into other verticals. The majority of their revenue comes from paying users who ‚Äúdonate‚Äù to their favorite streamers. This market has gotten a little more competitive with streamers being offered higher payouts elsewhere, so analysts have been ratcheting down their expectations. Huya has been upping the ante and is paying to keep their market position intact.  They overtook their rival DouYu last year as the number one in China.

Tencent owns about 1/3 of the company, and is trying to merge it with their competitor which it also owns roughly a third of, DouYu. The merger is stalled with the CCP due to monopolistic concerns. Ultimately, if it does go through the combined company would take back pricing power, and be attractive for software companies to make deals with as they would own \~80% of the Chinese gaming streaming market. If it doesn‚Äôt go through, it‚Äôs also good because HUYA is winning anyways, so would expect them to continue to take market share from the competition.  Also, it's heavily shorted on merger arbitrage so there would be an unwind trade.

The company reported earnings on March 23rd which beat by a penny, and the stock began its descent, closing the day down 12.5% to close at $22.36. At $17.76, it is now down another \~21%.

Here‚Äôs where things get interesting‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve got a company that is growing earnings at 20+% with a fortress of a balance sheet. If you ex out the cash, you‚Äôre buying a cash flow positive company at 10.76, with expected earnings of $1.14 next year, if you stick a boring 15x multiple on this and knock 2022 EPS down to $1, 15x1 = 15 + $7 cash = $22, but if you put the growth valuations into it, it probably gets a 20x PE (FB is 22 x 2022 EPS), and it could rally to $27 by year end. I could use some fluffy price sales ratio to jam this higher, or just remind you that this hit $36.33 earlier this year and was over $50 back in 2018. I think it‚Äôs headed higher, way higher, what am I missing?

I remember when Facebook debuted and it had huge engagement, but made no money, I feel as though it took them a while to find the right balance of advertising/monetization opportunities and perhaps they held back in order to keep up their user engagement.  Nobody likes getting spammed with ads. This company is doing something similar, their advertising revenue is miniscule, but with such massive user engagement, they have huge potential to monetize those viewers.  I would expect some solid growth in advertising revenues in the next couple of years, this is the opportunity I am most excited about with this company.

Cathie Wood owns some, Morgan Stanley and Renaissance Technologies were buyers in q4 2020, and when the 13-Gs were filed, this took off like a rocketship.

2021-04-23 15:25:53,stocks,"I agree with your thesis. I am quite bullish on this, primarily based on their cash balance. I excluded it out from their market cap. And also tencent focuses on gaming will also equate that it is very unlikely that they unload their shares in huya. Tencent will be a strong backer to Huya. 

Huya paid a premium to douyu, so if the merger doesn‚Äôt go through, I don‚Äôt necessarily see more damage to Huya as compared to douyu. If it does go through, I think it‚Äôs probably good and market will react positively, even thought Huya paid a premium (since I believe the market value the merger as a positive sign - when the merger was said to be possibly stopped, they both tanked)

Huya also have the ability to grow, as they more than 5x the revenue since their IPO from the back of my head. 

Just one comment ‚Äú...and was over $50 back in 2018...‚Äù
Correct me if I am wrong, but I don‚Äôt think that this is necessarily an accurate comment. You have to look at the total shares of Huya as well. From what I have seen, Huya have increased their outstanding shares since 2018 significantly.

With that being said, I believe Huya is significantly undervalued. My fair valuation for Huya is $25-28.
With $18 being a strong support point. I personally hope that it will break the support and to go $15 point."

Stoked to see what they can do with Nimo and the markets outside of China.  But even without significant growth there, I see profit growth coming from well placed advertising which they so far have not really capitalized on.

Growth stocks are always a roller coaster.  I posted because of perceived GARP value, and a margin of safety because of the balance sheet.

2021-04-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 22, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 22, 2021**

Stocks fell on Thursday, erasing yesterday‚Äôs gains as market volatility continues. Stocks fell after Bloomberg reported that President Biden would propose increasing the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.91% down, the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.94% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 1.21%.

According to a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy), President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor/salary. 

Corporate earnings have so far exceeded Wall Street‚Äôs even lofty expectations, as companies benefited from both a surge in consumer spending as the economy opens back up and cost-cutting measures implemented during the height of the pandemic.  However, despite the largely positive earnings, many stocks have failed to react positively to the news. It seems as more positive economic data is released in terms of consumer spending and unemployment, it takes more and more impressive results to convince investors to pile into the stock. This suggests there is froth in the markets given the sky-high valuation of some companies, in our opinion.

Jim Caron, investment management fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley (MS) said, ‚ÄúWhat we have is the absence of a catalyst. Everything that we‚Äôve done over the last twelve months has been to build up to this point, to get this recovery, to get a very, very strong second-quarter GDP, which we think could be upwards of 10%. But after that, things start to slow down. It doesn‚Äôt mean that the data gets bad, it just means on a relative basis that the third quarter will be weaker than the second quarter and the fourth quarter may be weaker than the third quarter.‚Äù

In the not too distant future our government will not be able to handle all the required payments. Unfortunately many other governments around the world are doing the same thing.

Standards of living continue to improve at every income level.   Reagan's changes led us out of the dark, malaise days of the 1970s.   I think one of the reasons we are seeing a leftward shift is an increasing portion of the voting age population is too young to remember how much worse things were then.

I find it funny that those advocating for the 99% think economic disparity is inherently undemocratic, as the 99% outnumber the 1% 99 to 1.   And keep voting for politicians for ever increasing subsidies and hand outs.

Beyond the immoral nature of just expecting the rich to fund ever more subsidies, I think there will be a negative impact.   Lowering the expected returns on investments lowers the incentive to invest - full stop.  Fewer investors taking chances will result in lower economic development and lower prosperity, fewer jobs, and a lower standard of living for all.    It won't be offset by government spending because by definition, govt spending is less efficient than private spending.  Infrastructure projects that are chosen and sourced with political motives will have more waste and less utility than those chosen for economic reasons.  Handouts and subsidies to individuals will only fuel consumption in an already arguably overconsumptive society.

It won't happen overnight, but  there will be an enduring negative impact."

Sanctions would not be direct at countries, but banks.

The US is the largest economy in the world and the location of the world's largest financial market. The US government can cause any bank in the world to instantly fail by stopping transactions between that bank and the US. No bank will cross the US government.

Evading the IRS is next to impossible these days, even for Americans who live and work entirely abroad. 

If you invest in securities or any other vehicle that goes through a broker, your brokerage is required to report your gains to the IRS. 

If you refuse to invest in the above, your main alternatives are direct equity in private companies, and real estate. Each of these have their own LLC level reporting requirements that only make it harder to evade the IRS. 

If you somehow manage to only invest in untraceable foreign channels, as an American who lives in America you ultimately still have to withdraw your funds back into the US, so you can actually spend it. When you do, you US bank is required to report to the IRS, who will be up your ass immediately.

2021-04-22 22:06:07,stocks,"If I had noticed it earlier. I would have shorted it against going long Transunion (TRU) HF-style in equal dollar amounts. 

Here's an exercise for you: take the $ increase in Cash from Operations divided by the $ increase in revenue. That's the incremental $ of cash flow per extra dollar of revenue. It is a very high number because it is essentially a fixed-cost business. Given the rate of growth in revenue, it deserves a high multiple.

Consider what FCF will be in a couple of years and divide by the current market cap. That's a better FCF yield than alot of tech companies with lower growth rates.

In relatively new to investing and have some shares in US stocks on the NYSE and live in the UK.

I knew that if I ever struck gold I would be required to pay capital gains tax in the UK on anything over ¬£12,300 but recently read something about because I would be earning gains from an American company I would be taxed on profits before it even gets to me at 30% (thereabouts)

I have seen that I can fill in a W-8 form for reduced tax as countries have agreements etc, but everything I've come across it's to do with when you receive dividends etc, so any information would be really appreciated. (Ie if i filled in the W-8 form and reduce the tax payable to 15%, would I still pay the 20% in the UK on what's left after the American tax?)

Hope I came across in a way that someone can understand as I couldnt find anything in plain english explaining it in easy to understand terms etc."

2021-04-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Opendoor ($OPEN) has a lot of potential in a year or two Recently did some research on Opendoor ($OPEN):

* Opendoor is disrupting the residential real estate by giving instant competitive cash offers and certainty to sellers, and charging about a 7% service fee, slightly more than a traditional real estate agent's 6%.
* Opendoor has the highest volume, revenue, and gross margins compared to its 3 main competitors ‚Äì Zillow, Offerpad, and Redfin.
* Opendoor is doubling its footprint from 21 markets to 42 markets in FY2021, which with back of the envelope math says $10 billion in potential run-rate revenue.
* Opendoor is estimating $3.5 billion of revenue for FY2021, which is conservative as the forecast was likely prepared during July or August 2020. There was uncertainty back then (some said widespread vaccination by 2022) yet vaccines are mostly available to the general public now. Offerpad ‚Äòs forecast from its presentation during March 2021 also shows more aggressive FY2021 revenue growth compared to FY2019. Wall Street is estimating $4.0 billion of revenue for FY2021, which is also conservative. A better baseline revenue for FY2021 is probably around $6.0 billion, which can be derived by applying Offerpad‚Äôs FY2021 growth rate from FY2019 to Opendoor. $6.0 billion is also Opendoor‚Äôs FY2022 revenue forecast and we are reopening a year sooner compared to some conservative forecasts back in July 2020.
* Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARK Fintech Innovation bought 644,400 shares on 4/12/21 and then 46,400 shares on 4/13/21. They bought  456,600 more shares on 4/19/21 and 137,988  shares on 4/20/21.
* Current share price around $19.00 has a lot of upside. If we use $6.0 billion as baseline FY2021 revenue, 5x revenue multiple is about $52 a share. It is $93 a share if we apply FY2022 revenue using management‚Äôs 79% revenue growth from FY2021 numbers.
* Long term, if Opendoor‚Äôs business model successfully disrupts the residential real estate market we could be looking a share prices much higher than $93.

2021-04-23 05:00:53,stocks,"I agree with you OP. My mom is a real estate agent, and I also do real estate on the side (primary job as a SWE) - and trust me, there are plenty of people who would be willing to take on a slight discount to their home values to sell their homes within a few days of listing. Realestate portfolio managers with a ton of properties to sell will feast upon this as soon as it broadens out to wider markets.

The massive risk is that in a down market, OPEN would be left holding deadweight properties, but I was impressed with the risk management of executives (at an exchange for a big revenue hit. A contrarian thesis is that if anything, people would want to sell houses quicker during a realestate crash, which actually bodes well for Opendoor.

It‚Äôs also the only PropTech company that made my mom and I go ‚Äúwow this could make us irrelevant‚Äù. OPEN is my 5th largest holding and I am long as well. Excited for the future."

I'd actually be very willing to pay an extra 1-2% in commissions to sell my house in one week as is, rather than potentially 2-3 months of touch ups, staging, and waiting (which could all be potentially just as costly).   I just have no interest in spending my time on that stuff, I'm lazy and like peace of mind. Other people love side projects or need the $10-20k. This definitely isn't for everyone."

And what you do save by going through Opendoor is staging costs, HOA costs, interest on your mortgage, tax, and having a guaranteed closing. This can be worth much more than the 1%-2% repair costs that you find exorbitant. 

The site exists because it provides liquidity to the home. If a homeowner that wants to buy a home has a contingency on selling their existing home, Opendoor provides assured closing. 

They make their money off of the service fees and ancillary services such as escrow, title, insurance, warranty, and mortgages. A one stop shop for a home transaction. Zillow, Redfin, Offerpad are all in the iBuying market because of this market opportunity It's completely different from the home flipping you're talking about."

2021-04-23 14:31:38,stocks,"Whether you sell your house to open door or have a realtor list and sell it, the owner/seller is paying out 5-6% fee/commission either way. With opendoor, you avoid the hassle of having multiple potential buyers coming in your house to look at it while you‚Äôre still living there, and also avoid the hassle of dealing with the buyer having to obtain financing and worrying if the appraisal will meet or exceed the contract price. Basically opendoor does a single inspection of your house and makes you a cash offer on the spot. No repairs necessary, no negotiating, no waiting for a bank to drag their feet on the closing. Minimal hassle for the owner/seller."

2021-04-23 11:44:36,stocks,"Here is my take on Green Thumb Industries Inc, GTBIF.  It dropped on the announcement of an investigation into a pay to play scheme in Illinois when the company was just getting started.  The allegations are that some contractors/advisors/consultants paid people to get to the front of the line for licenses in Illinois, so the stock dropped.

Here's why I think that's a good thing.  Even if it's true, that kind of charge won't take down the whole company.  

1) It will take down the people involved in the pay to play scheme, the company has grown substantially since then. 

2) At worst it will take out the licenses in Illinois, they've expanded operations beyond Illinois.  It's more likely it will only take out a handful of licenses in Illinois, or they will have to pay fine on ill begotten gains.  

3) The size of their market is huge without legalization, they will weather this storm. 

4) With legalization the stock will pop massively. 

The investigation creates a buying opportunity.

The point of my post was not ""invest in HBO"". HBO was just one example that I was using of a service that provides higher quality and more rewarding shows rather than the quantity over quality approach. There are multiple other producers that I would put above Netflix in that category as well. My post was in reference to you saying that Netflix had the ""best content"". I don't think that is true in terms of quality nor popularity. Hell, if the most popular shows are Young Sheldon and NCIS as you said then that is a plus for Paramount+ over Netflix since it is Paramount's content.

For a long time, the most popular shows on Netflix have not been Netflix originals; it has been old content from other studios such as Friends, The Office, and Breaking Bad (quality long-term rewarding shows; the kind which Netflix doesn't care about producing). And now with the rising competition and that competition taking back their popular shows from Netflix, leaving Netflix to have to spend more and rely more on their original content, I question how long Netflix's quantity over quality approach can be successful before people start getting fed up with their lack of providing quality long-term rewarding shows like other studios have a much better track-record of providing."

And I'm going to assume that the ""1 show"" that you are referring to is Game of Thrones. The disappointing conclusion to Game of Thrones is not HBO's fault. HBO was willing to give the show as much time and money as they wanted; it is the show-runners that wanted to rush to the finish line and is why the ending was disappointing.

Game of Thrones was a massive cultural phenomenon for many years. Drawing massive record-setting ratings, bringing in huge numbers of new subscribers, and dominating discussion in pop culture every single week after a new episode aired. The dropping of a new Game of Thrones episode was a massive event every week that had the world talking and watching.

Nothing that you listed there from Netflix has had that kind of impact. Again, if you think that those shows are higher quality to you, that is fine, I definitely don't agree, but I can respect your opinion on that; but in terms of impact, they don't come close."

2021-04-22 21:37:29,stocks,Netflix is still king for now because it is basically available worldwide.
2021-04-22 21:30:02,stocks,How are they lagging behind Disney? You can only watch kid shows and nostalgia so much. I also see no need to rewatch movies after seeing them once. They have mandelorian and Wanda vision that is it.
2021-04-22 20:51:37,stocks,"Lately netflix is even lagging behind prime video.

Amazon is killing it with some great content lately."
2021-04-23 11:37:28,stocks,"Not by their fault. They started as middle man for these studios to show their products, these studios realized the potential big money by doing the Netflix platform and decided to take their IPs back and make more money. Netflix should had been more aggressive at locking up these IPs for longer terms or doing even more originals or buying certain ‚Äúdead‚Äù IPs."
2021-04-22 20:25:32,stocks,I think youtube started streaming before netflix...

2021-04-22 20:37:07,stocks,I feel like I read Disney owns 40% of content after it's last merger. Anything rated R or not theme park related will probably make its way to Hulu instead of Disney+ They don't want to dilute the brand.
2021-04-22 22:43:57,stocks,"Why would they? They get to charge for each service separately. Also different branding, Hulu is targeted for a more mature crowd and Disney+ is more family friendly."

2021-04-23 16:00:31,stocks,"That's why I ended up turning away from Netflix. I got sick and tired of them cancelled every good and interesting show they made after 1 season, maybe 2 if we were lucky. They just need to start making their shows all miniseries that have an actual real ending cause they obviously have no interest in actually letting their shows mature."
2021-04-22 22:22:21,stocks,Hulu is also part of Disney though

I agree that it‚Äôs still a relative niche in some ways, but it‚Äôs a solid base to start from.
  
With that said, Netflix is still king for the time being."
2021-04-23 16:04:20,stocks,They could start by not canceling every interesting original they make after 1-2 seasons.

2021-04-22 22:45:51,stocks,Maybe to do with costs of running two different t services. Thought maybe the Home Screen of Disney+ could take you to Disney originals or Disney adult or something and have both services combined. For that matter add the espn products too. Reason being is I‚Äôd pay 20 bucks for that however I‚Äôm not going to pay all separate and instead will stick to Netflix
2021-04-23 08:02:26,stocks,Yeah but I like war movies. Why can we not match the quality of 1995-2000 in 2021
2021-04-22 21:55:20,stocks,"Marvel superheroes are so overdone now. Everything Disney puts out is ‚Äúwhite bread‚Äù content that tries to appeal to the masses. The Boys reinvented and took risk which Disney will never do as they are afraid of offending anyone in their broad audience.

2021-04-22 22:39:32,stocks,"idk about America, but in Asia here the Disney Star content is great - have already watched the Alien movies, Planet of the Apes, Atlanta, It's always Sunny, What we do in the shadows TV series, Orville, and some ESPN 30 for 30s. They also have stuff like Walking Dead, Lost and Homeland."
2021-04-22 22:47:23,stocks,"Netflix also burnt a lot of people cancelling things on cliffhangers.  Disney is less likely to do this, since shows are much more planned/controlled."
2021-04-23 13:54:18,stocks,"The decline of Cable ESPN, which was a huge money maker for them, was big. The stock being flat probably says more about how well they have handled that."

2021-04-22 22:47:46,stocks,"Weirdly, the last few months I‚Äôve been watching Hulu 90% of the time and hbo and Disney the remaining 10%. Netflix hasn‚Äôt been used more than a hour or two in months."
2021-04-22 22:46:13,stocks,Disney buying Fox was a HUGE boost to their back catalog.
2021-04-22 22:44:17,stocks,That sounds even better than what we get in the UK!
2021-04-23 16:03:29,stocks,"Yeah Netflix is awful for that. I think every single show I've gotten into on Netflix in that last few years has never survived beyond its first season, maybe two. The fuck am I paying them for when all they do is blue ball me again and again."
2021-04-22 22:42:39,stocks,And Nazis
2021-04-22 23:03:55,stocks,"Hulu has some good stuff but they hardly update their catalog. Still the same stuff from years ago and the stuff I do want to watch like shark tank is a bunch of old episodes with a few new ones. 

Their documentaries are pretty trash as well compared to netflix and hbo which actually do them well a considerable amount of the time. Their UI is also bad so if a show is also on HBO ill watch it there instead."
2021-04-23 03:29:29,stocks,What shows would that  be? I¬¥m not up to date on all of then so maybe I can skip a few and save some time =)
2021-04-23 03:34:53,stocks,"Altered Carbon 2nd season was so bad I didn't make it past the 1st episide. 

Glow got really bad near the end, it turned into a big therapy group and they focused on the wolf girl a lot who was a really stupid character to begin with. 

Ozark I don't understand how anyone likes the show. It's like a horrible version of breaking bad. 

You might like them I pretty much have no interest in netflix originals except their documentaries. I have been meaning to watch queens gambit though."
2021-04-23 03:38:09,stocks,Also didn't like where they took umbrella academy in the 2nd season. I really couldnt stand ellen paige's character. Seems like every super hero show needs the tortured girl with the tragic past that gets really powerful when she unleashes her emotions. The show worked when it was a bit campy and watchmenesque.
2021-04-23 04:49:43,stocks,"Thanks, can agree that there is a lot of shows that has a cool first season setup but after that they have no plan how to develop the plot further."

2021-04-23 03:55:09,stocks,"Even if it's not directed at me (I think), I'll reply with this:

\- 99 out of 100 Market Timers are using a wrongly tuned stop watch and their crystal ball is defective. 

You might be lucky, picking the right time to ""get in"" near or at a (perceived) bottom - but do you have the fortune of getting out, detecting the ""top""? 

Initially, after jumping off at 30+% gains, you might feel good, but what if you detected a fake top and it was a short dip, after which that stock rises after you dumped it 2x and more with you watching with your now looking measly 30% gains? 

It can go both ways, so the same goes for feeling great for jumping off before a real slide. You just need to be prepared to live with the consequences of your bets.

This is more about setting a convictional pricing at which you ""jump in"" and then keep holding on until it hits a certain threshold at which you jump off no matter what."

2021-04-22 21:22:26,stocks,"Do not buy CS now. They have serious identity issues. They need to choose whether they want to be a full fledged investment bank or a focused wealth & asset manager. By trying to be both, they fail at both.

You lose money investing in banks when they deviate from the underlying economic norm, ie JPM only loses money when America goes through a recession vs. randomly. This is because they will have to do dilutive equity raises at the lows since the high capital adequacy ratios are foisted upon them by Basel III/IV. CS clearly has risk control issues (never good for a bank; GS & MS have great risk controls despite their cowboy reputations).

If they finally give up their wild ambitions and say they will double down & pare down on their asset mgmt future, then I would consider buying. Better yet, why not split the businesses so investors can choose which one they want. CS will claim falsely that their two businesses are super linked, but that‚Äôs a stretch - go sign a cooperation agreement between the two new arms if need be."

2021-04-22 21:43:27,stocks,"Their pile of cash ran out pretty fast.

Air Canada is also in a better position to leverage the government for better terms on a bailout than American carriers because the US is an oligopoly and Canada is a monopoly.

Everything was fine until Air Canada began cutting flights and cancelling routes.  The federal government scrambled to come up with a bailout plan.  Because Air Canada can continue to run profitably... it just can't provide national access"
2021-04-22 21:32:08,stocks,"The airline industry mostly has anti-trust immunity in most things.  Airlines are mostly about take off and landing rights.  If one company gets too many take off and landing rights they can inch out all other competitors.

Mergers can happen as long as landing and take off rights in identified areas are released to allow competitors to take them over."
2021-04-22 22:18:52,stocks,"They had to maintain service to all airports they flew too in order to get government money in the bailouts. They could cancel service to an airport, but only with DOT approval.

And that's not a colloquialism, you're misusing that too. Definitions don't completely change based on the level of formality.

2021-04-22 22:11:30,stocks,"The level of formality does not change the definition of the words you use, it changes the selection of words you use. ""Average"" has a very specific definition. 

""The middle"" would be an informal/colloquial way of referring to either the average or the median, but using either ""the average"" or ""the median"" to refer to ""the middle"" is wrong - it doesn't work both ways. Words still mean the same things regardless of how formally you're using them."

2021-04-22 21:47:08,stocks,"You know what isn't forward looking? Thinking Tesla can grow its market when companies like GM, Ford, Toyota, and VW are releasing new EVs every year.

Tesla would have to grow sales by 150X to level that chart. Tesla will be lucky to grow sales at all over the next decade."
2021-04-23 02:56:22,stocks,"Markets are currently believing that this could happen.  Tesla investors/speculators could be wrong or they could be right.  Only future can tell.  In October/November 2019, there were fears that Tesla is burning too much cash too soon, but now folks speculate it's going to be worth 2T $ or more.

Before PCs became household commodity, IBM's CEO said computers are a niche only a few handful would be purchased every year.  He didn't have the vision Bill Gates had.  Keep the perspective that things could change rapidly.  They may not.  Markets can also remain irrational for a long time and we would always have post-crash narratives on why something happened the way it did.

My central point was we can't take a fact from the past and try to justify Tesla's current valuation is bonkers.  This shit is complicated."
2021-04-23 04:17:42,stocks,"Yes, all valid and fine.

And to trump your MSFT fun fact: no one had the vision Steve Jobs had, hence Bill Gates' company didn't invent the iPhone. Instead, they waited until their ""safe bet"" ratio was so overdrawn that they put out an ultimately destined-to-fail Windows Phone OS - and then they didn't have the guts to just pull through and evolve that to be an Android competitor and wasted all that R&D, salvaging it somewhat with Surface - but not really, since that is only a tablet competitor. Could I have foreseen that? No chance. I just saw them raging full steam into that market with Win Phone and no stamina to end up in a trainwreck.

They were also somewhat the first when it comes to the MP3 mobile players. Who remembers Zune today? No stamina in that company. Maybe Satella steers it differently than Balmer but boy did they drop several balls.

Ie. no one can foresee who does what until after the fact.

It's basically placing chips on a very large Roulette Table, with the added benefit of there are many more balls in play than just one (for companies to come out successful). Plus you are able to look behind each number's potential benefits and financials at the moment of research and the past.

But I have yet to find a FOMO confirmation machine to tell me if all that FOMO into that one ""brilliant"" company is justified or if it's just a bunch of fluffed up hogwash.

For TSLA I'm doubtful it's worth as much as it currently runs for, even my biggest optimistic guesses can only look at that P/S ratio and think: how fast did they want to catch up to those classic auto makers again?

Or, to put it differently:

Forward valuation is ""elated"".

How far elated?

My guess is as good as the other doubters'.

People seem to forget Tesla is only one side of a gigantic equation, that is tied to so many external factors that can make or break this pretty quickly."
2021-04-23 07:29:20,stocks,"You've learned to deny reality and see Tesla's opportunity as infinite and without competition. Which is too say you've been conned, or simply don't know how to look at a product market.

The PC outran IBM's expectation because IBM lacked imagination as to how the PC would be used and who would want one. They also failed to anticipate the market lock-in that hardware/software compatibility issues would generate. Competitors still took huge markets from IBM.

Tesla is making a car to replace other cars. The car market is well known, since it's over a hundred years old. A car is a car. There are no new use-cases there. Teplacing a gas car with an electric car doesn't give access to a billion new features, the internet, or porn.

One electric car does the job same as another electric car. So they're differentiated by details of use and style and the impression they are assumed to make on others. Every large car maker is making not one but several models to serve those submarkets.

Brand impression is very important in car sales, and Tesla has used up most of what it can get.

TL;DR: EV is not PC. The car market is finite, Tesla has neared brand saturation, and dozens of competitors are going to take the rest of the available replacement sales.

TSLA will be a good long-term short."
2021-04-23 04:31:35,stocks,"True.  IMO, even if Tesla meets the production numbers, FOMO buying TSLA at the current price now could yield suboptimal returns."

For spac's, penny stocks and IPOs, you are just rolling the dice and that's fine if you like the company and think the hype is going to make you money, but be prepared for sudden drops and to exit with a loss or be stuck with cheap stock that isn't worth anywhere near what you paid."

2021-04-22 23:33:48,stocks,"I swear half of stock subreddits are ""only buy gme, gme to the moon"" and the other half are ""only buy spy, if you buy anything else you will lose money"""
2021-04-23 09:11:16,stocks,"Each of those can be useful but you have to filter through the noise to get to the good stuff. WSB used to have a bunch of legit DD posted there before the gamestop shit started going down, and hopefully we will return to some of those users coming back. 

But basically, just curate each of those sites to only users you like/trust. Find and bookmark people posting good DD on subreddits, follow specific authors on seeking alpha or whatever. Every site is going to have noise, but once you filter through you can get some good shit every now and then."

2021-04-23 03:38:40,stocks,"So, yeah, stocktwits is dumb as fuck most of the time, but I'll look for some suggestions on there for my penny stocks. Only place I've gotten actual non-pumped penny stocks. Reddit is fucking horrible for that, and everything that has been posted here is already about 75% pumped. I've gotten in on some good pennies that haven't been pumped yet because of luck after people posted on other tickers."

2021-04-22 22:39:01,stocks,"There is no correct place. That being said - everywhere. Just take a little bit from each, cook it in the oven from 350 degrees, season it with some good ole ""I feel like this is gucci"" and call it an evening."
2021-04-22 20:21:17,stocks,"Ultimately where you go for ideas is also dependent upon how you intend to play. Day trading is far different from long term investment. With day trading your best bet is to know a bunch of other good day traders with whom you share information. I suspect you are in it for the long haul though and for that I feel your pain. Good long term investment advice is considered valuable, which in turn means that nobody gives it away for free. Compound that problem with the fact that it is easy to claim to know something but actually be no good at it. I sometimes think that a good instinct combined with some common sense and a little research often times wins as well as anything else. Luck helps a lot too. üôÇ"
2021-04-22 20:54:43,stocks,"Agreed with your summary in general but I think each can be useful at times too. The discussion on Stocktwits is very much an echo chamber but the active viewer count and message volume can be a good indicator of social popularity and potential volume. Certain subreddits can be a little better for discussion like this one. I hope WSB will recover soon and accept more varied (non-GME related) posts. PennyStocks seems to be shaking off the shock from the small cap exodus too.  


There are a few aggregator sites like [unbiasedstock.com](https://unbiasedstock.com) that are pretty useful too. I think I came across the link here a while back but I will share again for those who may have missed it. You can filter through most of those mentioned over select time scales and see what is being mentioned at a glance."
2021-04-22 21:03:18,stocks,"Seriously, 

I don't usually look in reddit, I pick a sector and look at performers. However, there is a lot more DD after that. 

Like for  instance CLOV..

Yes, it was a zach morris twitter stock, but I was in it before all that hype. 

I look at the stocks competitor prices, last I seen Humana and United Health Care were both in the 100's. They said clov was a break through technology with ai so people could save money and time.  Those reasons interested me because it was only 15 bucks at the time. I hold my stocks for long periods. I read stocktwits during work to pass my boring periods, it's pretty comical. 

Next I did UGRO, it's some how affiliated with the pot play, but their recent contracts have been for lettuce. I looked at similar stocks and felt it was a interesting buy. 

&#x200B;

I have been watching ACCO it's some computer and book supplier for schools and anything else that uses that material. It also has a dividend, if that's worth anything, but it's also locked up with hedge funds owning a vast majority. Probably won't go much higher, but it's pretty safe."
2021-04-23 06:13:42,stocks,"There are two forums I consider the highest quality:

* [The Corner of Berkshire and Fairfax](https://thecobf.com/forum/). Mostly value investing, but they are not really a conservative bunch and there is plenty of high quality discussion. It is my favorite investing forum. The name suggests focus on BRK and FFH, but there are sections about plenty of other stuff.

* [Bogleheads](https://bogleheads.org/). Even though I don't use the Boglehead strategy, I occasionally visit this forum and there is a lot of quality discussion.

No meme stocks and most people know what they're talking about. So much more consistent quality than any subreddit or a discord server. Reddit does still have quality content but I think that I need to filter out more and more as time goes by and subscriber numbers grow."
2021-04-22 22:10:41,stocks,">Motley Fool: overpriced and useless

I don‚Äôt pay for any of their services, but I invest primarily based on their strategy. I also love their podcasts. They‚Äôre free, daily, and offer interesting discussions on relevant companies. Take everything with a grain of sand, but I‚Äôm a big fan of their shows."
2021-04-22 20:36:41,stocks,anybody have experience with Bloomberg paid site?
2021-04-22 22:19:04,stocks,"Unfortunately in a bull market such as this, people rarely make mistakes. The first correction was the over-valued tech stocks and these stocks have hit people pretty hard considering many bought close to all-time highs. Once people's portfolios stay red for a long time, most people will get rid of their individual holdings and transfer them to ETFs or exit the market in general thinking they can get better returns elsewhere. Hopefully, the survival of the fittest scenario applies here and the people who have successfully picked great stocks (in a variety of market conditions) continue to make DDs after the 'shitty' DD posters decide they can't pump any more stocks."

2021-04-22 20:34:01,stocks,"I'm starting to think their model is kind of like those old commercials where they would guarantee x number of winning picks on this sunday's football games. Of course people who would call those numbers half would receive one group of ""winners"", and half would receive the other thereby guaranteeing that half of the callers would automatically assume that they had found the hidden gem of football picking gurus. 

Motley Fool was much the same way. They're litany of stock picks that come out day in Day out are virtually guaranteed to almost always carry a few winners that they can then showcase as proof positive of their guru-like stock picking abilities. Their lifetime achievements enhanced by big names the Amazon Apple netflix. 

They're just a newsletter company and a marketing company. Sadly."

2021-04-23 09:39:26,stocks,"I won't argue with most of that except the medicaid being handed out, that just didn't happen. That has always been for people under a certain income level. If anything today in states where medicaid was expanded, it's available to more people now after the ACA. Also, our food was laced with chemicals that were worse than anything today  (like DDT) that has since been banned, but unlike today, we had no organic options.

You also forgot the fact that when boomers were younger when we went to work we could often start working at  a low level in a company and work our way up to run that company one day. There was opportunity for advance.ent that just doesn't exist today.  There was a contract for that company to help provide a pension for retirement, and there was job security. That doesn't happen anymore. There were also labor unions and no right to work states. 

Believe me, I will shut other people my age down when they start to argue about the younger generation not trying hard enough. However I was only speaking about intelligence level. You won't suddenly become ignorant when you get older. We didn't have the same access to information, nor the same access to disinformation that we have today, and most in my generation don't understand the difference between the two."
2021-04-22 21:21:12,stocks,"I think PayPal is a solid choice. A lot of people overlook Paypal's additional products and partnerships and often talk about it primarily in terms of the PayPal app. In addition to Venmo, they also own Xoom, one of the best ways to send money cross border and hugely popular in central and south america. They own Braintree, which is a competitor to Stripe and powers the payments behind many direct to consumer brands and in-app payments for apps like Uber and Airbnb, among many others. Everytime you use one of those apps, paypal gets a percentage of the payment.

I'm also keen on their partnership with Mercado Libre, a major marketplace in south america that has seen tremendous growth in the past two years. 
PayPal also benefits from a very sophisticated and mature risk modeling service, which is used by all of their products and partnerships in their payment network, and will only continue to improve. I could see it becoming a standalone service they offer in non-financial contexts ( for example identity verification or fraud detection)."

2021-04-23 00:34:53,stocks,"I know I said that PayPal seems overpriced at a P/E of 75, but Square may not be at a P/E of 853. The reason for this is that they are probably reinvesting earnings into growth at the moment.  


Square is still growing very rapidly. It grew sales 100% in the TTM. The P/S is 12, which translates to a P/E of 120 if they can ultimately end up with a 10% net profit margin, and 60 if they can manage 20% net profits.  


This is not terribly expensive for a company with this kind of growth. PayPal has a higher P/S of 14.5, and that's for a bigger company that is growing much more slowly."

2021-04-22 23:02:08,stocks,"It means people are willing to pay $40 for $1/year of earnings, or, to wait 40 years to break even.

But companies never paid 100% of earnings as dividends, and stock appreciation is like real estate appreciation. Once the market decides a location is going to be overpriced, there's no stopping it."
2021-04-22 21:11:16,stocks,"true, VC funding has caused customer acquisition costs to go through the roof, but I don't think that's really in the same realm as building a factory to create forklift or tractors etc. That takes wayyyy more money and manpower. And once the software has been developed the costs for maintenance and new features are negligible. Imagine if the Nike factory cost almost nothing to run on a daily basis"
2021-04-22 23:17:26,stocks,"Highly skilled developers turn out to be fairly expensive actually. Maintenance is rarely cheap if done right... given that everything is a subscription now, it's even more of a priority. Nike.. The shoe costs $20 all together. Value added is in marketing."
2021-04-23 01:17:24,stocks,"I am a developer actually, so let me explain to you how my industry works, so you can stop embarrassing yourself like this

Let's take Microsoft as an example. They put a ton of money into making windows 10. But, licensing 5 copies of windows 10 costs them about the same as licensing 5 million copies. Each extra unit costs them essentially nothing to produce. And the marginal costs to upgrade and maintain software, compared to the cost of constantly sourcing goods, maintaining machines, etc is hilariously low compared to other industries.

This is why software companies have such high multiples. Almost all the cost is baked in upfront, and you can license essentially infinite amounts of new units of software nearly for free.

Oh and one last thing, maintenance IS cheap if done right. By definition, if you've written the software right, and maintained it well, the maintenance is easy (and therefore cheap). So please, just stop commenting now. You clearly don't understand how software works, so arguing about the cost structures of software with you is getting really annoying for me"
2021-04-23 09:11:06,stocks,See you just cited Microsoft... which last time I checked is a 2 trillion dollar company that‚Äôs been around for 30 years. I didn‚Äôt realize we jumped from ‚Äústartup‚Äù to ‚Äúliterally the exact opposite‚Äù. Yes I understand copies of Office don‚Äôt directly cost them anything lmaoooo goodbye
2021-04-23 13:04:53,stocks,"ok fine, substitute RedHat or Mongo in the same example. But you already know you can't argue on the merits, and never could. But you did get the opportunity to learn something. I doubt you will have learned anything though, you seem like the ignorant type"
2021-04-22 22:44:17,stocks,"Different companies selling basically the same product (go by whichever has lowest fees).

The following are S&P500 ETFs: VOO, SPLG, SPY, IVV

The following are S&P500 in Mutual Fund form: FXAIX, VFIAX, SWPPX, SVSPX

(and I'm sure there's a lot more out there for institutional class level)

&#x200B;

You buy SPY if you are an institution that needs high liquidity (e.g.: moving billions instantly). SPY will have a higher expense ratio due to this premium and its dividends will be delayed.

You buy VOO/SPLG/IVV if you don't need that extra premium.

Companies:

* VOO = Vanguard
* SPLG, SPY = State Street Global Advisors \[note SPLG exists for people like you\]
* IVV = BlackRock"

2021-04-23 02:24:17,stocks,"what's really funny right now is that people are greedy right now - look at the valuations of damn near everything in this market (especially COIN). If you follow WB's advice, now is the time to be fearful."

2021-04-23 17:09:39,stocks,"I was perusing reddit for opinions on Boeing out of curiosity just now.    


So, one of your points about work from home is actually one of the big lingering issues for BA:  the business sector and business travel haven't yet rebounded from covid, and since it has disrupted the way we do business (via telecommute), that business might never return.  So that means fewer flights and fewer transcontinental flights, fewer airplanes and fewer big planes.  Airlines make their money (and good lord, so many industries) on business travel.  furthermore, we might see protracted covid cases and strain variants headed into the next cold season.    


BA‚Äôs balance sheet and debt is just astronomical.  If it continued to maintain a monopoly on big planes and airline demand stayed up, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a great long term hold, no question, and it might still be.  But they‚Äôre gonna be stuck with the sins of past management for a while, and their company culture is ostensibly rotten.    


However, it is a company that will (at least foreseeably) always be propped up by the US Govt (something that probably helped create their backward corporate culture).  And this market liquidity and exuberance could very well drive the stock into the 300s in the near-mid term, I think.  But, I think earnings combined with airline data are going to offer a stark picture; however, determining when wallstreet and investors acknowledge the obvious is a whole other thing.  If BA traded on its worth for the next 2 years right now, I‚Äôd say it would be (BS number off the top of my head) maybe 180.    


Will airlines and business have ‚Äúnormalized,‚Äù post covid, after companies have gotten used to not forking out 10s of thousands of dollars for business trips and dinners and miscellaneous expenses?  And millennials aren‚Äôt as interested in handshake deals as their predecessors.    


I‚Äôd put it this way, if it tests the 300 threshold, you might exit and wait for a pullback(s) and some better news.  A lot of people see the 400 valuation it‚Äòs traded at, and they‚Äôre taken in by the apparent discount.  If it were a sure thing that it‚Äôd more or less be on the path to profitability within 2 years from now, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a definite hold.  But it doesn‚Äôt look that way.    


this was fun.  thanks for coming to my ted talk"

2021-04-23 00:53:21,stocks,"Got in at $20/sh and have not even thought about touching it. I got in to Penn at $18/sh and it is the same story. They have limited exposure to markets that are going to be profitable. I am in the camp of sex, drugs, and gambling as being the best bets for nice returns. Draftkings are in 10 states and Penn is in 19 states for being legal. To me, that is so low on market shares and overall exposure in the market. The future is bright, but it is a longer term look, as online gambling has been talked about more often in state elections."

2021-04-23 10:30:38,stocks,"OPEC disagrees with you. Nuclear is actually estimated to grow a lot onwards to 2050. Solar, wind, hydro, geothermal is awesome, but the technology isnt there yet for it to be viable on a massive scale. I wish i was wrong but looking at the numbers it makes no sense. I agree renewables are the 'futures future' but if we dont want to cook ourselves in the mean time nuclear is a good birdge for the gap in power our nausetingly optimistic expectations we have for renewables. Nuclear does NOT compete with renewables in the grand scheme of things, its just a lid to keep co2 emissions low untill they are reliable enough for a 7 billion and growing population."
2021-04-23 19:17:38,stocks,"I‚Äôm not stating anywhere that nuclear won‚Äôt grow. But running a grid is much more than just being able to produce power, and nuclear power in the current format cannot participate in the balancing market. That is a big problem as renewable energy enhances the need for a strong balancing market. You cannot run a grid on only nuclear and renewable energy as you have nothing to absorb frequency deviations resulting from variations in renewable energy production. 

In the general media, the nuances of grid stability are not really portrayed, but there is a lot more to it than simply producing X MW of power. You need instantaneous access to increases and decreases to power production at the right places at the right times. Thus the investment decisions for choosing nuclear power is not simply a matter of comparing the costs to those of gas and coal plants."
