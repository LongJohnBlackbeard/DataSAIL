2021-06-22 19:51:24,wallstreetbets,BMW had a hydrogen 7 series in the 90s. There is literally nothing difficult on the automotive end of building a normally running Hydrogen car. The problem is storage/transfer/cost/safety of Hydrogen. And the standard methods of Hydrogen production use more energy than Hydrogen produces  its a losing game until some new means of cheap Hydrogen production become available. That basic problem hasn't changed in decades.
2021-06-22 19:53:11,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs great to know, wasn‚Äôt familiar with it."
2021-06-22 19:54:09,wallstreetbets,What do you think about state like Arizona cutting great electric deal for Nikola to make it affordable: https://www.utilitydive.com/news/arizona-grants-innovative-electric-rate-schedule-for-nikola-green-hydroge/593364/

2021-06-22 18:28:35,wallstreetbets,"You had me at ""multi-bagger"""
2021-06-22 18:51:46,wallstreetbets,"Good analysis. The only point I take issue with is the comparison to Logitech. Logi is taking a deep dive into the video conferencing world with their Rally systems. They are solid systems that run soft codecs on either a NUC or dedicated user PC. They utilize far-end content sharing, a proprietary camera with voice tracking and mic/speaker system. The price point is attractive compared to similar solutions from Cisco or Vaddio, so I believe their market share will continue to grow in this space. 

This will be their main source of innovation moving forward and a substantial percent of their business in 5 years. I do not believe it is an apples to apples comparison. 

Otherwise great DD. In for five 9/16/2022 45C."
2021-06-22 18:43:51,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúA True Potential Multi bagger?‚Äù
Did you ring?"
2021-06-22 18:39:43,wallstreetbets,I am leveraged to the tits with crsr. 850 shares and 20 calls. Not selling a single one
2021-06-22 18:28:36,wallstreetbets,Fuck it I‚Äôm buying more

2021-06-22 18:35:31,wallstreetbets,This place is rigged lol
2021-06-22 18:33:54,wallstreetbets,"quick question to the crsr bulls: revenue was stagnant until last year. in 2018 they earned 918M and in 2019 they earned 1B so there was not much growth. their revenue exploded in 2020 but that was due to the pandemic. how do you know that's not one off?

Yahoo Finance has next year growth at 6%. if that is true then share price is not doubling."

2021-06-22 18:54:50,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the input!! Good luck to you
2021-06-22 18:32:18,wallstreetbets,The only logical response
2021-06-22 18:41:00,wallstreetbets,We are at the start of a new gaming generation. Plenty of people have been unable to upgrade their systems. Additionally a DDR5 announcement should be coming soon. There is still demand left in the tank. Not to mention the growth of the streaming market going forward. Awooza!
2021-06-22 19:09:20,wallstreetbets,"Well let‚Äôs compare:

LOGI - 5 bil in revenue 21 bil market cap (4x)

CRSR - 2 bil revenue 3 bil market cap (not even 2x)

So I believe it is undervalued on its current valuation."
2021-06-22 19:19:41,wallstreetbets,they're buying up streaming gear companies too
2021-06-22 18:40:33,wallstreetbets,"Nobody can predict the future. I will answer your question with counter questions. Why has Q42020 and Q12021 shown substantial, record high revenues/earnings?

Do you think that gaming/streaming demand is going to fall off a cliff?"
2021-06-22 18:41:46,wallstreetbets,You don't like $CRSR? You got Puts? :)
2021-06-22 18:44:42,wallstreetbets,"gaming and streaming was popular in 2018 and 2019 as well, but their revenue was stagnant. What will happen once we go back to our normal lives? pandemic is behind us, and lockdowns are easing everywhere, will the growth in revenue still be there? we will see. good luck, op."
2021-06-22 19:16:58,wallstreetbets,"Record high yes but to his point, growth is slowing which is true. Obviously gaming isnt slowing down, whether it'll grow at an exponential rate is anybody's guess."
2021-06-22 18:49:07,wallstreetbets,Nope I only trade stocks never touch options. I‚Äôm laughing at the ‚Äúmy personal price target‚Äù like you‚Äôre actually anything important that makes that statement matter lol what‚Äôs your background? Education? Which investment firm do you own to justify anyone caring about your opinion of a shallow stock?
2021-06-22 18:58:00,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit this boomer is salty‚Ä¶ this is the internet, the man can share his perspective and thoughts freely. Sounds like you‚Äôre the uneducated one if anything"
2021-06-22 19:20:53,wallstreetbets,I mean that target of 72 is just a short term adjustment. Another quarter of revenue growth triggers forward cash flow adjustment triggers short bailout will just do that. Like 1.2x1.2x1.3 = 1.87
2021-06-22 18:53:27,wallstreetbets,"It seems to me that you have other personal, possibly financial incentives..?

My background is irrelevant to the post, focus on the post content- not the materialistic factors. I can delete the ""personal price target"" phrase if it helps you sleep at night. :)

Someone shit in your cheerios this morning though it seems, I am sorry."
2021-06-22 18:59:18,wallstreetbets,Boomer? I‚Äôm probably younger then you üòÇ although I‚Äôve been a part of this sub since before the Moronic retail investor influx from covid so I‚Äôm aware of what it‚Äôs intended purpose is.
2021-06-22 18:55:53,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt like Cheerios. I do however like when this sub functions as intended and everyone stops pumping their crap because they got stuck holding bags. Cut your losses and move on to a better stock. Then post your gain/loss porn AS THIS SUB WAS INTENDED FOR. We‚Äôre not here to pad your wallet so maybe try another sub.
2021-06-22 19:02:24,wallstreetbets,You realize you just tried shaming this man with a ton of assumptions for no good reason? You literally are tryna act like you‚Äôre the embodiment of WSB yet you said you NEVER touch options? What do you think drives the amazing gain/loss porn that you‚Äôre referencing?
2021-06-22 18:59:10,wallstreetbets,"My position on $CRSR is already very profitable, I had it before WSB started talking about it. To me, I want to provide good DD on names that pop up on this sub, and this one fit the criteria. If you can present to me a DCF or a real bearish case on the stock then we can debate on it"
2021-06-22 19:04:44,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt participate in the losses I‚Äôm just here to enjoy seeing them. I day trade, never hold, and never long term. Welcome to Wall Street BETS, the casino of trading, gamble and yolo your life savings away at the entertainment of others.

Only difference is you are only on Reddit because of the hype, they were already here and joined wsb and started posting because of the hype.

You‚Äôre more of a shill than they are."

2021-06-22 18:21:54,wallstreetbets,Bought 14 7/16 35c when it dipped below .80 each. Im in!

2021-06-22 19:44:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah the current set up do CRSR is so comfortably safe. I‚Äôve put half of my portfolio into it this afternoon
2021-06-22 17:19:12,wallstreetbets,oi im long crsr but you forgot to mention that theres an institutional interest (Eagle Tree) that has been unloading shares and thus keeping it range bound 30-35.
2021-06-22 17:30:28,wallstreetbets,"Thought I bought the dip when it fell to $39. I had to think again. Normally I would cut my losses and move on. But I am sitting this one out. There will be returns.

That said, isn't a majority share holder dumping their position slowly causing the ceiling at $34? Maybe my memory is fucked up, dunno."
2021-06-22 17:11:37,wallstreetbets,I firmly believe anything under $33 is a massive steal when it comes to $CRSR.  Even under $37 is amazing

2021-06-22 17:25:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes but that‚Äôs not the reason it‚Äôs range bound. As free float increases and volume, their selling effect will lessen. Short selling because of shorts‚Äô certainty eagle tree will sell is what‚Äôs doing that. If eagle tree wants to maintain majority control they‚Äôre probably about done selling now."
2021-06-22 17:46:11,wallstreetbets,Eagle tree has been selling around 35. No guarantee they‚Äôll keep selling at that price. If they want to maintain majority control they‚Äôre probably about done selling.
2021-06-22 17:24:14,wallstreetbets,"Look at Logitech‚Äôs rise, Corsair will do that and possibly more depending on how they execute. This market cap will 4-8x with relative ease."
2021-06-22 17:33:25,wallstreetbets,"uhh ...  last week, with its run up to 40, there was insider unloading of nearly 22m shares at 36 to 40 dollars. who knows how much more they will unload, but that was certainly the death of the last breakout.

that's almost equivalent to the entire public float. 

chartmill.com/stock/quote/CRSR/ownership"
2021-06-22 19:20:39,wallstreetbets,"My question is why are they selling?  They've been unloading alot.  I'm looking at getting in, but I need to eat two bananas and do some more DD.

I know the brand.  I've used their products for years.  Love the company... but need to dig more before dropping cash in this one."
2021-06-22 19:26:00,wallstreetbets,Arent they obligated to wind down their interest to 10% eventually or some shit due to an agreement when they bought the company. Swear i cane across that info somewhere
2021-06-22 17:34:53,wallstreetbets,"Yes it was, and it‚Äôs a good thing they did it. Free float needs to increase. Short sellers capitalized on the insider selling. I think there won‚Äôt be so much on the next run up and short sellers counting on it could get surprised."
2021-06-22 19:22:13,wallstreetbets,They acquired Corsair in 2017 and helped them build into what they are now. They‚Äôve made a healthy return on that investment and are working their way out to do it with a new company. Just the way private equity firms do their thing.
2021-06-22 19:26:33,wallstreetbets,Read my reply
2021-06-22 19:29:28,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a rumor more or less at this point. They‚Äôve historically held companies up to 15 years it seems. Their selling will be less impactful as volume and float increases. People worry about them too much.

It gets brought up like this because people like you think WSB didn't exist prior to January 28th, 2021. 

Posts like this are exactly why WSB has gone down in quality. This isn't an investing forum it's a casino (or a Wendy's depending who you ask). It used to be crazy options plays on weekly FDs, now it's a bunch of people asking for others to do their DD and evaluate whether a stock is good. Everything is ""buy shares and hold!!"" or ""Squeeze imminent!!!""

Play SPCE or don't. But if you're looking for DD on it there's plenty. Don't act like there isn't."
2021-06-22 16:47:36,wallstreetbets,Oh I think I heard about that. Jeff Bezos acquired SPCE which owns $WISH.

Wasn‚Äôt trying to attack you or anything, just from a long term SPCE investor‚Äôs perspective I think this company deserves more attention than what it‚Äôs getting now. I‚Äôve done my own DD and I truly believe that a new ATH before the end of July is highly probable and that‚Äôs a pretty good increase from where it‚Äôs at now, even after the 10% jump today, so I thought the people of WSB would appreciate it more. 

Anyways, have a great day, friend!"
2021-06-22 16:57:06,wallstreetbets,No. God... Special stupid here. Bezos has his own company called Orbit. Richard Branson owns Virgin Galactic (SPCE). Why did I even say anything...

2021-06-22 17:35:52,wallstreetbets,"I own Nov AMD 100 calls too.

My Micron play is bigger because as I see it DRAM pricing is not end cycle, not even close.  And I'd like to know where you see all these sell ratings.  Last I checked my gayboy etrade account analytics there were like 20+ bank nerds that had a buy rating on it with an average PT of 116.  Hans Moseman, the fucking legend has a 160 PT on it LOL!  I think one single scrub came out last week and put a Hold rating on it because he hates making money and probably wants to kill himself.  I see no sell ratings.  Maybe I'm just blind though.

Anyways.  MU ER is next Wed after close.  What I want to see is some strong guide through 2022 indicating confirmation to my stable DRAM pricing prediction.  If the stock rebounds out of this chart pattern, it's going to be a rocketship.  It needs to beat the short pressure though, and there's a lot, because if it breaks below 75 in the next few weeks/days, it's in for some short term trouble.  Probably all summer.

Also, it's worth mentioning MU is always undervalued compared to it's peers.  Big money fucking hates this stock because it's beta is a fucking 2, the float is diluted to shit, and it trades like a commodity. But when it rips, it fucking RIPS."

NVDA was pure luck, I'll admit that.  Bought before the split announcement.  

ADBE though, that seemed like it had to hit sooner or later.  It's had steady 20-40% growth for 8 fucking years, beats ER every fucking time, and stalled after hitting ATH since last sept.  It's the original SAAS play, and it was being grossly undervalued compared to it's peers.  It was bound to hit sooner or later.  and honestly I won't be surprised if it keeps running for a bit here.  ADBE really is a juggernaut in the space."

Ram Prices seem stable to higher from what I noticed. Excited for next week."
2021-06-22 19:28:00,wallstreetbets,"Oh ok, on MU.  I still like the July 85's.  At $1 those are a 10x bet if it hits 52 week high by expiry.  That's a solid gamble structure by anyone's measure.  Especially if the sell side pressure is total crap, like it most likely is."
2021-06-22 19:32:01,wallstreetbets,You're safe my dude.  Channel your inner Martymoho and will it into existence.  Just make sure to sell green though when it runs.

2021-06-22 16:16:43,wallstreetbets,On 12/16/ 2019 RAD opened at $7.66 and closed $14.03 Volume was 83.75 Million.  Now as a reminder RAD only has 55 million shares outstanding.  One week later 12/23/2019 RAD opened $13.90 and closed at $20.30. The volume for that day was 100 million shares traded. Twice last year RAD traded over 50 million shares. Shorts are clearly trapped. In order to suppress RAD's price. They use Naked Shorting. And with each attack. Shorts lose RAD shares to Retail buyers and Institutional ownership. Institutional ownership has gone from 47% to 75%. Retail owners have added as well.  Earnings out on June 24th. With a nice beat and a little rhythm and rhyme. You might be looking at the next Big RAD Hit!

2021-06-22 19:25:12,wallstreetbets,"Let me see if I got this straight: we are counting on Citadel being unprepared for the NSCC changes proposed on March 5 that will take effect tomorrow (as described below). That seems like a big stretch to me because the below is most likely completely meaningless.

&#x200B;

On June 21, 2021, NSCC received regulatory approval of the proposed rule change SR-NSCC-2021-002 and advance notice SR-NSCC-2021-801 (‚ÄúFilings‚Äù) that proposed to amend NSCC‚Äôs Supplemental Liquidity Deposit (‚ÄúSLD‚Äù) requirements.

  
The effective date of the proposed changes will be Wednesday June 23, 2021.

  
The changes are described in detail in the Filings and include:  
(1) calculating and collecting, when applicable, SLD each business day, rather than only during  
the monthly options settlement periods.  
(2) calculating SLD based on observed Member activity, rather than based on historical and  
forecasted settlement activity.  
(3) adopting an intraday SLD calculation and collection, when applicable, including on the first  
business day of the monthly options settlement periods based on additional exposures that are presented by options activity submitted after the start of day.

  
The full text of the Filings may be obtained by visiting the DTCC website at [www.dtcc.com/legal/secrule-filings.aspx](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/secrule-filings.aspx).

  
Any questions related to this notice should be directed to NSCC Hotline at (212) 855-8099."

I'm heavy in BB, but I bought 100 shares of GSAT this morning, because it's so cheap. My HOPE is that the stock price is so low it invites more speculation from the community, but I've been beaten up by hope here (BBags exhibit 1, per my only WSB post).

I guess I'll wake up early in the morning and see if it's jumped and possibly get on the ask for some calls. They're distant enough that actual investors believing in the 3.25 (or whatever B. Riley said) might get it there, or that WSB has decided to put a small hedge off in a cheap stock.

I'd love to be in GME/AMC, but the entry points are too expensive for me to really leverage. With GSAT at least I risk losing only $170 if my 100 shares all disappear overnight"

2021-06-22 16:10:18,wallstreetbets,"The theory I'm aware of is that various parties are overleveraged shorting meme stocks and the DTCC just approved a rule (that comes into effect tomorrow) that lets them make hourly margin checks instead of monthly.  

Thus, it's harder to avoid getting margin called, which would force shorters to exit their positions, driving the price up more.

Since y'all want a source:  

>As discussed above, NSCC may only collect supplemental liquidity deposits 
during monthly options expiry periods under its current Rules.24
However, NSCC can 
face sudden liquidity shortfalls on any business day, not just those business days that fall 
within monthly options expiry periods, particularly during volatile market conditions 
unrelated to options expiration.25
To address this issue, NSCC proposes to change the 
frequency at which it may collect supplemental liquidity deposits to each business day, 
based on a daily calculation. 

>A Provider26 will be obligated to provide a supplemental liquidity deposit on each 
business day in which its settlement activity causes a liquidity shortfall at NSCC.27
NSCC will provide a notice to each Provider of the amount of its supplemental liquidity 
deposit, which the Provider will be required to fund within one hour of such notice.

2021-06-22 18:22:53,wallstreetbets,"You need to do some more personal DD before you start fucking with volatility. 

You can‚Äôt buy or sell VIX - I‚Äôm sure you know this, but of course you buy/sell funds derived off the VIX. Each of those funds are exposed to VIX in different ways. Just look at the difference between VXX and UVXY. 

Main point is that all funds derived from VIX are ultimately affected by the sp500 because VIX is based off options on SPX. 

They‚Äôre all not the same, but heavily correlated. Also, the mentioned above is the reason why SPY and VXX do not have a totally inverse relationship and you would be mistaken to trade like they are."

2021-06-22 18:23:43,wallstreetbets,. . . .
2021-06-22 15:47:07,wallstreetbets,"Ha,  Huge profits and adding daily. Thanks."
2021-06-22 16:00:58,wallstreetbets,Lol. FUD spreader spotted in big font!  Russell inclusion on the horizon.  Your loss dude.  We‚Äôre all fighting the same battle against short sellers here!
2021-06-22 16:51:07,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for adding! I meant it more as a minor correction to your statement:

""Confirmed and finalized funding to move the factory to 60,000+ annual capacity."""
2021-06-22 17:08:52,wallstreetbets,Thank you. Scary for beary...
2021-06-22 17:00:06,wallstreetbets,"You just gave a false naritive right there. It's not because you know it but because you don't understand the business. 

Auto companies need a lot of capital in order to actually start production so they ALWAYS take out loans. We have yet to take ours out on our factory assets because we are waiting for the ATVM loan simply because it's the best loan you can get.

We have 11 months worth of cash to start and continue production so we have plenty of time to wait for them. If we somehow don't get it then we simply take out an asset loan on the factory which we can do at any time.


As for the pre-orders crap it's just sillyness. They stopped taking pre-orders on the website all together because they have enough demand (reservations, pre-orders with deposits, whatever makes you feel good inside to say) for 2021 and 2022. (Which is well over 30k trucks).

Ford, Tesla, rivian, all use pre-orders for their trucks. It's just wordplay for headlines. Seriously how would there not be demand for a working electric full sized truck that's first to the market? Think"
2021-06-22 15:49:49,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúThe Company believes that our current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale of such vehicles.‚Äù

That was from the Company‚Äôs own SEC filing from 14 days ago. They in on the whole short and distort thing too?

2021-06-22 15:41:44,wallstreetbets,What about the stuff about the trucks catching on fire? Execs just up and bailing and other things like that?
2021-06-22 19:42:56,wallstreetbets,It makes me so happy to know that morons like you are losing money gambling against America
2021-06-22 15:42:42,wallstreetbets,"No binding orders, yet, then. Got it."
2021-06-22 16:20:25,wallstreetbets,Founder is out.
2021-06-22 17:09:59,wallstreetbets,"Who is this  ""we"" you keep mentioning. Yes for F , Tesla and Rivian. Pre order numbers are just silliness. You know why ? Because all 3 of those companies have some combination of existing sales, customers bases,  or large amounts of cash. And don't need pre orders to survive. Unlike RIDE wich won't last 12 months without a cash infusion. As far as loans. Your kidding yourself. They have zero sellable assets, and that includes the ""factory"" Once RIDE is bankrupt, that factory will sit and decay for decades. Just like most old abandoned auto factories do. And in case you haven't noticed,  there's no RIDE truck on the market. So they aren't the first to anything.  Let's not even get into the lack of a sales or service network. There won't be any government loans coming, or mortgages against the Factory. GM already owns right to any potential EV tax credits. Leaving RIDE with not much to auction off"
2021-06-22 16:05:34,wallstreetbets,"The filing you linked to was a post-effective amendment to their year ending December 31, 2020. Not sure if you know that companies can file an amendment now, that reflects what their position was back then, even if things have changed and are different now?"
2021-06-22 18:01:45,wallstreetbets,So they get a loan.  Big deal.
2021-06-22 16:15:10,wallstreetbets,Translation: we need to get more money and there are many ways to do that so we can do commercial scale production and the lunch of sale on such vehicles
2021-06-22 15:57:52,wallstreetbets,"OP is some sort of shill, wallstreetbets is basically dead, it's nothing but bullshit posts.  RIDE is totally done and will burn down to $1 before being delisted from the exchanges."
2021-06-22 15:45:14,wallstreetbets,"Steve is an engineering, his time as CEO was planned and limited, in my opinion.  I will shift to bearish if a CEO isn't announced within a month.  I do believe it's a possibility for Jerome to show up.  His timing of leaving Tesla Truck and sharing Telsa shares was a matter of days before Steve's departure.  The company did release a note saying that the CFO and CEO departure was not related to findings in the independent legal audit."
2021-06-22 15:46:51,wallstreetbets,"A prototype caught fire. How many teslas have caught fire.  Hell how many Ford F-150's in production have.  As for the two execs, I liked Burns, but he tried throwing too many irons in the fire.   A camper van, an RV, who knows what else.  Getting the truck to market, at scale, should be prioritized over everything."
2021-06-22 15:43:24,wallstreetbets,1 prototype caught on fire. It was caused by hand wiring the battery pack before they had an automated assembly line build them. No more human error now. Robots are less likely to make mistakes
2021-06-22 19:47:31,wallstreetbets,"I feel so warm and fuzzy inside, because I made you so happy."
2021-06-22 15:44:59,wallstreetbets,Correct. Just like the cybertruck and F150 lightning
2021-06-22 15:46:32,wallstreetbets,"Neither are Ford's or Rivians EVs,  Ha Nikola doesn't even have a factory built and they're at 6B Market cap.  Let's apply order, reservation, binding, and preorder terms consistently across the market."
2021-06-22 16:48:59,wallstreetbets,">Founder is out.
   
He is literally the biggest single shareholder in the company and owns 1/4th of Lordstown. Yeah, ""he is out"", lol.  
However, he will most likely drop all the shares on the market when he is able to."
2021-06-22 19:56:36,wallstreetbets,Cfo from RIDE dropping in üòÇ
2021-06-22 18:32:15,wallstreetbets,"Ride is a pos that has little cash and has nothing to sell atm.
When your ""asset"" is a old af car factory I think you are screwed unless they get a huge money donation from retail trades"
2021-06-22 16:24:13,wallstreetbets,"Umm no, companies don‚Äôt just go around restating financial statements. The company restated their financials because they fucked up the accounting for warrants.

That aside, the original March filing didn‚Äôt include the going concern disclosure. It was added when they filed the restatement 14 days ago. Furthermore, going concern is evaluated for a period of 12 months following the date the FS were issued, not the balance sheet date and not the date of the original filing. 

In other words, based on all available as of June 8, the company had substantial doubt about their ability to survive the next 12 months."
2021-06-22 16:27:51,wallstreetbets,"They amended it now because their very recent audit, which was forced upon them, discovered their financial liabilities which they did not self disclose in their last filing.

They are fucked."
2021-06-22 18:11:15,wallstreetbets,"If they had the ability to ‚Äújust‚Äù go get a loan, they wouldn‚Äôt have needed a going concern disclosure. Is everyone here really that deluded?"
2021-06-22 15:47:15,wallstreetbets,"Well I hope it works out for all you that are invested in it... I just don't see it personally, and was looking for other points of view. Thanks."
2021-06-22 15:45:09,wallstreetbets,"And what about the CEO and CFO selling shares and quitting?  I'm not trying to shit on people for investing, but all signs point to this company being a shitshow."
2021-06-22 16:11:02,wallstreetbets,"F already sells a million trucks a year,  and the Mach E sales are sold out. So let's not compare RIDE to F. They aren't in the same class. Rivians a private company that isn't trying to pump share price. And Fisker is just as shady as RIDE, and the only one even comparable"
2021-06-22 17:07:55,wallstreetbets,Because they‚Äôll be worth $100 each when his lockup ends. Good for him!
2021-06-22 16:32:20,wallstreetbets,">heir financials because they fucked up t

SEC changed warrant account for SPACs in third quarter lol. Do you know how many companies re-filed!?   lol"
2021-06-22 16:28:43,wallstreetbets,"they announced they had funding until May 2022, so technically they miss the June deadline... so the going concern is valid... but it still doesn't mean they are going broke, or won't be able to secure funding... it's just legal jargon for the sake of legal jargon.... who's not going to lend them money now that they are fully tooled, programmed robots pumping out 300k (capacity) truck / year... truck fully validated, crash tested etc..."
2021-06-22 15:49:22,wallstreetbets,Nice.. that's fair.   Anything this company would need to do for you to become more interested?     Other vehicles move into pre production testing?  Leadership change?   Certain number of vehicles sold?
2021-06-22 16:35:06,wallstreetbets,"I got 251 shares and im gambling here. Plenty of people in the lordstown subreddit are absolutely delusional. They think media collectively are conspiring to take down lordstown lol. Lordstown is absolutely a gamble. That being said, a lot of the headlines cover negative aspects of lordstown which I dont blame them bc its mostly are facts. But those negative headlines have been dealt with IMO. Such as one prototype catching on fire in Jan, or burns lying about 100k preorders. At the same time, company has a massive factory and 85 percent done with retooling. I personally think its cheap bc of negative coveraging and I along with many believe their assets alone are worth more than current market cap."
2021-06-22 15:58:47,wallstreetbets,"Burns hasn‚Äôt sold any shares and he can‚Äôt until October, unsure if the CFO sold any shares, but it was confirmed that a few other executives sold $8M worth of shares back in February.  Think about the risk trade off there.  Put yourself in their shoes, if you could sell half of your equity and guarantee life changing money, with another half that could be estate changing money, what would you do?  I appreciate the perspective of taking into consideration the long term prospects of someone‚Äôs livelihood into account. 

Also let‚Äôs be realistic here $8M of sales on an at the time $5B company.  We‚Äôre talking 00.1% of the company when that had taken place.  Look at the Forest from the trees bro."
2021-06-22 15:46:00,wallstreetbets,They don‚Äôt have a CEO right now and the previous CEO‚Äôs shares are locked up until November.
2021-06-22 16:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Careful now.. F sold out?  Are those binding, paid in full orders that cannot be canceled or revised? LOL  Please deduct 1.3B import fines they're facing, is that considered negative equity?

Wait,   Rivian is literally going public and is trying to pump up share price. [https://insideevs.com/news/511272/rivian-seek-70billion-ipo-underwriters/](https://insideevs.com/news/511272/rivian-seek-70billion-ipo-underwriters/)   


Fisker? lol   Their SUV is first and due in late 2022 to start production.  By the time they roll out a truck we'll have $4B-8B in sales already."
2021-06-22 16:24:42,wallstreetbets,"RIDE won't beat Ford, but they will take a piece of the pie. at about 2% of share, they'll take $3B annually.  15% profit & an 8x multiplier =  market cap of $3.6B.   They'll need some debt to get there, but still own their plant outright."
2021-06-22 16:52:20,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre right. But that doesn‚Äôt make any of what I said untrue. 

1) Companies don‚Äôt just restate for shits and gigs, it‚Äôs done to correct misstatements. 

2) The Company‚Äôs financial outlook was substantially worse in June compared to March."
2021-06-22 16:49:56,wallstreetbets,"Are you for real right now? Going concern disclosures aren‚Äôt just comments made in passing to make lawyers happy. If a company has a going concern issue it‚Äôs because their is **SUBSTANTIAL** doubt about their ability to survive.

Sure, maybe they will find funding. But lets stop pretending that the company is a great investment when they don‚Äôt even know how they will manage to fund them selves a year from now."
2021-06-22 15:51:45,wallstreetbets,"I honestly just don't like the trucks. I think they are ugly and won't appeal to the average pickup driver.  If they got good leadership in place, and had some really good demos, and some good preorder numbers I might become interested. I am keeping an eye on them for sure, but I do not expect to purchase any shares. I might play some Calls on them if it seems like a good time to do so at some point though ;)"
2021-06-22 17:23:58,wallstreetbets,"This is a huge hyperbole. They are required by law to disclose the going concern until they've signed a deal to raise capital... even if they are 99% sure to get a loan (or other funding)... that's still a possibility and legally they must disclose that to shareholders.

A year from now they will be selling trucks."
2021-06-22 15:56:01,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion, the hub motors are a game changer for automotive design and manufacture. It‚Äôs not too much to call this disruptive technology, and expect many manufacturers to be using us in the future. Here‚Äôs a chance to get in on the ground floor. I‚Äôll put my money on that any day."
2021-06-22 16:01:08,wallstreetbets,"Just as a side note, they average pickup driver isn't the market.  They're meant for fleet sales.  Lordstown doesn't have to convince a 1000 pickup drivers this is the next big thing.  They just need to convince 1 fleet manager, who purchases a 1000 pickups that this is the next big thing."
2021-06-22 18:04:46,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not hyperbole at all. While you are correct about needing actual agreements in place, none of this shit is happening in a vacuum. They would have been having numerous discussions with their auditors in the lead up to the filing. 

If the company was anywhere close to securing funding they would have filed the 10-K/A after the funding was secured in order to avoid the going concern disclosure. The fact that they filed means that they are nowhere close to having it figured out. 

Everyone is acting like securing funding is this simple thing they can just do whenever they need in the next 11 months. Ffs the liquidity issues didn‚Äôt just magically appear in June. That‚Äôs just when we found about it. You really think they haven‚Äôt been trying to secure funding this whole time? Like they just now realized that money was tight? C‚Äômon dude, get real."
2021-06-22 16:07:30,wallstreetbets,"Exactly who in America do you think is operating pickup fleets of this size ? That are also willing to deal with charging station infrastructure costs, complete lack of sale and service centers etc ? Because Exactly zero of the big fleet players in America use pickup trucks."
2021-06-22 18:38:18,wallstreetbets,"Why do you think they wouldn't be able to secure the ATVM loan? They are the perfect candidates... the loan was literally designed for companies like LMC.. you think the Biden administration is going to let them fail (electric vehicles, jobs, economy) now that they are mass producing trucks? C'mon dude, get real."
2021-06-22 16:22:03,wallstreetbets,"Truck sales and leases make up almost half of all US fleet inventory?  And yeah, not every fleet is 1000, I think the average is 15, doesn't mean 1000+ vehicle fleet management companies don't exist.


And what the hell is the argument about charging station infrastructure.  Commercial fleets are the best positioned to put in charging infrastructure, they have the capital to put in a few hundred charging stations.  

As for service centers, I know the Camping World deal seems out.  But the Holmann deal is still on, and I'm betting we'll here more about service partners soon."
2021-06-22 19:19:34,wallstreetbets,"Because the ATVM loan program wasn‚Äôt designed to be a bailout. It requires applicants to be financially viable **without** the receipt of federal funds. Based on the 10-K/A, they are not financially viable right now.

Edit: source [https://www.energy.gov/lpo/atvm-faqs](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/atvm-faqs)"
2021-06-22 19:56:28,wallstreetbets,"They are financially viable though. They have no debt and capacity to produce vehicles. That is the very definition of ""financially viable"""

2021-06-22 16:58:00,wallstreetbets,"People be trolling you, but part of accountability is with the reader too.

2021-06-22 17:37:10,wallstreetbets,I think most of this subreddit just counts rocket emojis and gain posts instead of actually reading any of the DD these days.

2021-06-22 15:25:27,wallstreetbets,If you are doing it before expiry you should sell the options and then buy shares for the proceeds. Exercising is for Friday.
2021-06-22 15:17:57,wallstreetbets,When you exercise you buy the 100 shares at the strike price and then the value of your holding is in the current share price.

2021-06-22 17:38:57,wallstreetbets,You could sell the option and not overly complicated it
2021-06-22 15:18:31,wallstreetbets,The profit is in the value of the 100 shares your getting for $1500.

2021-06-22 15:22:02,wallstreetbets,"depends on how content you are tbh. if youre happy with these gains and can happily walk away without regret. then do it. if youre a gambler or the what if type, then you‚Äôll wanna exercise because one path is a gurantee. the other will open two doors"
2021-06-22 15:22:34,wallstreetbets,Oh wow! I wish I had that option!!
2021-06-22 15:31:29,wallstreetbets,I just had three of these that were expiring last week. I sold one used profit to exercise the other two and then bought a couple other stocks
2021-06-22 19:29:42,wallstreetbets,"Sell option... take the gains, exercise some options with profits... and sell those on the open market..."
2021-06-22 15:17:19,wallstreetbets,I would exercise. Profit stays the same but the share price will go up
2021-06-22 15:16:35,wallstreetbets,I would exercise it then hold for the squeeze. You‚Äôll make far more than $4-5K you‚Äôd get from selling the contract.
2021-06-22 15:51:37,wallstreetbets,I would sell to avoid being an AMC bag holder.
2021-06-22 15:59:52,wallstreetbets,"Well based on where we are trading today, I would say exercise it. 

Selling today is guaranteed money though. You could always sell, take half the profit and buy AMC to wait for the squeeze. That way you are playing with all house money."
2021-06-22 15:18:50,wallstreetbets,sell for $4128 or exercise and HOLDDDDDDDDDDDDDD for higher profits...think you know which one we all prefer....
2021-06-22 15:47:18,wallstreetbets,Fridays are for exercise and im not talking elliptical.

2021-06-22 16:31:34,wallstreetbets,"As everyone said‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd be dumb to exercise early. It‚Äôs literally more expensive to exercise than it is to sell the option and buy 100 shares.

The options have share price + time value. You‚Äôre throwing away the time value by exercising early. Sell that value to someone else and buy your shares.

In this situation, I‚Äôd sell and keep a significant profit and maybe let some of it ride."
2021-06-22 16:47:04,wallstreetbets,Lol the amount of dumb people is insane. The stock has like more than quadrupled too the squeeze happened. Shit I thought the squeeze happened when I sold my shares at a 100% gain back in Feb.
2021-06-22 17:16:34,wallstreetbets,"There is zero extrinsic value left in this. There is no 'significant' profit left. LOL. It may actually be trading at a discount based on tomorrow's opening price.  


Mid price on this call is $43.05, stock last traded at $58.27  
Exercise price: $58.05"
2021-06-22 18:11:41,wallstreetbets,"I meant I would cash out a large portion of the ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù profit he already made and only buy back a small portion, if any, of stock.

You can‚Äôt really compare an option price to the stock price arbitrarily if we don‚Äôt know when he screenshot it."
2021-06-22 18:57:13,wallstreetbets,">you‚Äôd be dumb to exercise early. It‚Äôs literally more expensive to exercise than it is to sell the option and buy 100 shares.

LOL. Well, that's not what you said. So, no, it is \*literally\* not more expensive.  


Of course I can compare the option price to the stock price because I literally looked it up. I also mentioned that it all depends on opening price tomorrow... The option is at parity, perhaps even a discount."
2021-06-22 19:31:11,wallstreetbets,"At market close
Stock: $58.27

$15 Call: Ask is $43.45 ($58.45)

The price you ‚Äúlooked up‚Äù is the suggested price to BID based on the bid/ask spread. It is not the price. Someone would have to accept it. The likelihood that someone accepts it typically swings up or down with the price.

There is no options arbitrage on a large scale."

2021-06-22 15:57:37,wallstreetbets,"What I find interesting about TX is when looking at the [YTD chart with it vs STLD vs NUE](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/TX:NYSE?window=YTD&comparison=NASDAQ%3ASTLD%2CNYSE%3ANUE)

STLD and NUE are up about 65% and 80% respectively year to date.  TX is up 15%.  The twist is in the chart, though.  TX's chart was mirroring STLD and NUE up until early May, at which point it flattened / declined while the others continued to grow.

Why?  With financials as clean as TX has, why isn't it's share price growing recently with other major names in steel?

I can't find any news about the company that would explain the disjunction of it's share price with other producers over the last 6 weeks, only speculation that instability surrounding cartels and political elections in Mexico has been scaring off investment.

I'm willing to bet on the upside.  I have 15x 11/19 $30 calls."

You are hoping for a miracle at this point.

If you believe in the company roll these to at least October (rolling = sell whats left and purchase further out)"

2021-06-22 15:38:44,wallstreetbets,"I'm bullish as hell on natural gas and nuclear.  Too many countries have emissions targets coming up that they're gonna be trying to hit.  Natural gas is a relatively cheap way to hit those targets, and nuclear is the greenest and most efficient option.  


I like CLNE's chances. I've got it alongside some TELL and USWS.  I think these are all long-term plays, though, so if you're looking for quick cash, I don't know that I'd hold my breath.    


This is not financial advice and I've done the barest minimum research while kicking back with a crayon smoothie."

2021-06-22 14:46:18,wallstreetbets,Odd place to ask for legitimate advice but here's an option. Just sell enough to double your original investment and hold the rest. If it goes up you won't miss out on much and if it tanks you still made money.

I'm glad more people are coming to realize the unreal potential for homebuilding stocks, as I've been screaming about it for a bit now. 

I actually wrote about the Lennar/CCS play here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtg7n/ccslennar\_like\_good\_god\_ccs\_is\_making\_me\_hot\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtg7n/ccslennar_like_good_god_ccs_is_making_me_hot_and/) 

Although, I ultimately sold my Lennar calls the day before earnings for a small profit as I had to exercise SOME risk management. I was on almost 27K margin across various plays (Commons and options across a few stocks), and had to deleverage for my own peace of mind (plus i was looking at Lennar to give me guidance on CCS/Homebuilders, even though I already knew it was going to be a great earnings beat). 

After the Lennar Earnings, and the economic data I wrote this piece here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3y8tf/ccs\_the\_company\_making\_a\_shit\_ton\_of\_cash/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3y8tf/ccs_the_company_making_a_shit_ton_of_cash/) 

I ultimately prefer CCS because it's undervalued in terms of trailing p/e and forward p/e and is simultaneously projecting higher revenue growth compared to Lennar and pretty much any other name (with the exception of one or two stocks), with a dividend yield that's comparable. I also am pretty sure it's going to beat it's EPS estimate like it has the other 5 quarters. It also dropped much harder than other home builder stocks. 

With that said, I think the sector as a whole is poised for a strong golden age in the next 5 years (at absolute minimum) and you could pick any homebuilder and make a ton of money."

2021-06-22 18:16:25,wallstreetbets,"Finished it. Summary:
Pros:
Good stock with good PE ratio and PB ratio.
Good potential for 50% growth in 12 months. 
Strong balance sheet, good positive cash flows. 
Notes are payable at the end of year, so current liabilities are not so current, as a result current ratio is good.
Cons:
Only related to Call options: The stock will grow but the timing is unknown. IMHO with current premium your options will not print. I would and probably will purchase longer options or use options to exercise them.
And thank you for great DD."
2021-06-22 15:28:49,wallstreetbets,In for the effort

A homebuilder can pass on the increasing cost to build a spec since it doesn't typically get sold til late in the process but a presale has its sale price locked in before the permit is even pulled. If a builder sold mostly presales (which under normal circumstances they like to do) then they would be at risk of losing profit to increasing material costs."

I think most of these builder stocks are good plays for the next few months. Literally every metric is going up, and I don't have any fears that it's a ""bubble"". The demand is huge and is not going away.

These stocks all move in tandem.. look at the other tickers move with KBH today. Now imagine 4-5 blowout earnings come out in a week.

Of course I have no crystal ball. But the picture now vs. May seems better to me, so I imagine the prices will reflect that soon."

I was curious about this before posting, and read about people talking about them here on Reddit. Mixed reviews. I checked that review website and they are rated very highly.. but it sounds like that only applies to house while it's new.

Of the big builders, would you be able to rank them from high to low, in terms of quality? I'd be very curious to see where they rank overall, as I've heard horror stories about many other builders too."

Before opening my longs in the housing industry 7 months ago I poured over data from 5 companies and KB was not even considered mainly due to the poor quality of their product. That said they are making money and that‚Äôs what matters on this trade. I just wouldn‚Äôt have them as an anchor in my portfolio.

2021-06-22 19:39:39,wallstreetbets,"What you say makes intuitive sense -- but how do you explain the increasing amounts of orders, all-time-high HBI numbers, 2004/5 level housing starts, etc? There's also the Delta Variant wildcard, but I'm not counting on that.

As you said, this is a casino!"
2021-06-22 19:18:24,wallstreetbets,"How many as presales, and when they took the sale vs when they built. If sales were up this quarter (Mar, Apr, May -- periods of high costs), then I presume they were able to charge more -- this will more than offset the higher-than-charged-for costs of the houses they actually built this quarter, no? If costs continue to fall, then the houses they sold in this quarter will end up cheaper to make, and that's more margin.

Either way, as long as demand increases they can sell more, and at higher margin to date-of-sale costs.

And, they may very well be hedging against costs anyway."

2021-06-22 17:39:27,wallstreetbets,What do you think about the end of the eviction moratorium and the effect that‚Äôll have on the market? Apparently over 11 million people will be foreclosed on and that could definitely impact the market. That‚Äôs more people than lost homes in 2008

2021-06-22 16:33:27,wallstreetbets,"Cheers. Appreciate the compliment. What I love about this is the bond ratings are also going up as the outlook brightens and they take in cash. Lennar became investment grade this year, and a slew of other home building companies are poised to become so as well after being upgraded a rung below. Between the note interest rates and the ability to not use the revolving line of credit, when that happens they can either refinance the debt for much cheaper or just pay it off early. The thing with the last few years was interest income took such a large part of the potential net income, but now these companies have deleveraged significantly and are bound to have no net debt to homebuilding debt. Sorry for the spiel haha, I‚Äôve been looking at the housing sector for such a long time now, so I get excited when talking about it."
2021-06-22 18:41:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, take it"
2021-06-22 19:39:50,wallstreetbets,I completely agree. Thank you for your high effort dd!

2021-06-22 16:17:35,wallstreetbets,Well done!!
2021-06-22 14:39:17,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, they don‚Äôt stick out to me as a quality oriented builder, they‚Äôre just like the rest of the builders trying to churn out as many rinse-and-repeat units they possibly can, and as fast as possible. Due to the insane growth of the market esp in SoCal, these homes are easily going for above asking and many times the community builders will have price increases after each batch. A property that was 600k was worth 800k in just a few months of time!

So my answer, if you are a decent builder that took advantage of cheaper land lots in developing cities around LA, you definitely turned a fat profit ü§£"

When people say things like Colorado City, CO, it's pretty easy to see through the rest of their bullshit all of a sudden."
2021-06-22 17:56:53,wallstreetbets,"I only really know the Denver and Fort Collins  metro areas since that is where I was working. Custom builders like sattler and homeswright are really good. Horizon, wonderland and toll brothers make good homes. There‚Äôs some mid range ones that should thrive, like richmond ($MDC) and a company actually called thrive home builders. Kb is definitely lower on the list. I wouldn‚Äôt let that deter you from investing. Their stuff falls apart after the home is out of warranty. As long as they don‚Äôt have foundation issues (which to my knowledge they don‚Äôt) they‚Äôll still be in business. The amount of building here is crazy. Fountain Colorado is just south of Colorado Springs and went from 3500 people to nearly 30,000 in the last 8-10 years. They just told home builders they are out of water so they can‚Äôt build anymore, so they will just continue going further out. 

I don‚Äôt see kb going down significantly and I think there is room to grow for sure, but just know their quality will increase volatility in their price. It‚Äôll be a wild ride"
2021-06-22 14:48:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah but market is weird and the lads will probably jump on this so who knows. I think stocks safer. Just staying away from options before earnings.

2021-06-22 15:29:08,wallstreetbets,"No. The trend I've seen is that KBH catches up to LEN within a few days after it reports earnings. [see this chart](https://preview.redd.it/cbltxfmgxu671.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=559a0ff34f6386101ce95f2850c92f8f6aa21c43)

This isn't bulletproof, obviously, but it's enough for me to gamble on when added to all the other evidence that they will crush earnings."

New data comes out tomorrow at 10am"
2021-06-22 17:51:11,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, have not considered it, and I'll look into. From the five minutes I just spent:

* that number is likely the absolute worst case scenario. Eg, if every person protected by the moratorium were to be evicted. There's probably a big difference between ""being behind on payments"" and ""getting an eviction notice July 1""
* in reality, most will make good faith payments or work something out with landlords.
* the states most effected are in the south, not in the regions that KBH sells to -- though of course the effect might spread nationwide
* I imagine if it's going to be that big of a crisis, the government will step in, particularly because it would effect POC

Would like to hear more takes/research on this -- it's honestly new to me."

2021-06-22 16:41:14,wallstreetbets,"I'm not well-versed on bonds (yet) so it's not something I typically look into. I'm smooth-brained and just figure ""more cash is good"". I'm grateful for the info you are providing here, it really illuminates just how many blind spots I have, which will help me improve as an investor.

Like I said before, I'm bullish on most of the builders, but I saw KBH had some immediate catalysts coming up, and it has earnings a month before the pack (minus LEN). So I dug into it first and liked what I saw.  But, I'm curious -- which builders do you think have the most upside for, say, the next 3 months (assuming demand is as insanely bullish as it appears)? I'm looking to diversify a bit."
2021-06-22 14:44:26,wallstreetbets,"Yep. They are in a hot market right now, in the best geos. Increasing orders, massive backlog.. they are printing for sure, even if costs are high they can pass them on."

2021-06-22 15:52:08,wallstreetbets,get them another boyfriend?
2021-06-22 15:36:59,wallstreetbets,LOL. He means no.
2021-06-22 18:07:14,wallstreetbets,"Thank you so much for this. I had heard that KB build quality varies from region to region, based on who they get to build. But it sounds like you're saying KB uses cheap materials, which I imagine are all the same for their models across the nation. Sucks, and if I'm ever in the market to buy I'll take your feedback into account!

But their reviews are great. So I guess the takeaway is to not trust that review site, lol.

I'm pretty new to the whole residential construction industry... I've spent only 30-40 hours researching, and mostly the macro conditions and technicals -- basically what you see in the DD. I did not have time to do a comparison between all the publicly listed companies (KBH has catalysts coming up).

Thanks for ranking these homes. Besides random redditors, would you know of a good source to get a sense of the build quality of these various companies? Or maybe Reddit is the way to go (I could head over to /r/construction or something)"
2021-06-22 16:35:50,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty excited for tomorrow and the next few days. Not sure what the typical ""short retail stocks"" algos/bots/etc will do on a day before earnings."
2021-06-22 18:06:52,wallstreetbets,"Lighten up, Francis"
2021-06-22 15:30:02,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Well off we go.
2021-06-22 17:17:47,wallstreetbets,Yes thats what I meant. If existing home sales are dipping whats the effect on new home sales?  One would think there is some correlation there. What do you think? Just a question.
2021-06-22 17:54:14,wallstreetbets,"For sure, just wanted to bring that up for you to consider. I personally don‚Äôt feel comfortable investing in that sector at all until the outcome is known. It could do nothing or it could potentially crash the market if allowed, and I feel like the fed‚Äôs contingency plans are pretty much used up at this point. Best of luck on your play though, and for everybody‚Äôs sake I hope it‚Äôs not that bad"
2021-06-22 17:10:46,wallstreetbets,"CCS, and M/I Homes are the most undervalued presently, and have excellent growth potential (Future P/E). They're the ones you want to get if you're into deep value. CCS has a dividend, but M/I homes is one rung higher in the debt rating (lowest form of investment grade, versus highest ranked non investment grade). While i expect CCS to get upgraded to investment grade, that's where they sit right now. 

Here's M/I's forecast earnings in FY2021 and 2022: [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mho/analystestimates?mod=mw\_quote\_tab](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mho/analystestimates?mod=mw_quote_tab)

I'm currently only in CCS, but i've noted that I want to get a smaller parallel position in M/I homes. I'm just waiting on the right time as the majority of my money is already tied up."

2021-06-22 18:15:08,wallstreetbets,"Ya it‚Äôs mainly in their materials. Cheap windows and siding, low quality roofing, cheap labor. 

It‚Äôs so hard to say overall because a lot of times you don‚Äôt know fully until years out and these neighborhoods are planned years ahead of time. I think that sub is a good place to start. Overall joke remodeling and construction is one of the most complained about industries in the country. A high end custom home builder might build a few 800k-3 million dollar homes a year. Kb pumps out a lot. I‚Äôm sure there are some industry rankings on periodicals but I‚Äôm not sure which are the best resource"
2021-06-22 17:23:27,wallstreetbets,"Not sure, haven't studied the historical correlation between them. I'd look back to 2000-ish numbers to see what happened there. My take is that there are enough signals that demand is through the roof (HBI, housing starts, prices, etc).

If I have time I'll start digging into the ""new sales"" methodology, numbers, and historical correlation"
2021-06-22 17:56:09,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for bringing it up. It's now definitely high on my list to look into. Another commenter just brought it up as well.

On the flip side to this, there's that NAR report of ""5.5m houses needed"" -- so it seems like builders are going to have to get busy."
2021-06-22 17:45:02,wallstreetbets,Solid. I have quite a bit of shares.
2021-06-22 17:44:50,wallstreetbets,"I have a feeling market is about to be flooded with houses for sale come Q3 when all these moratoriums expire. A lot of unpaid mortgages. Ramp up in supply is never a good thing for pricing power. 
Good DD. I will keep an eye on it. Not ready to jump in though. My personal take is we are going to see a huge flood of homes for sale Q3. I see some pricing pressure coming."
2021-06-22 17:54:27,wallstreetbets,"Another commenter mentioned the eviction moratorium expiring July 1. I guess we'll have to wait and see.

From what I read about the 5.5m house shortage, I don't think it matters. Our country needs new homes."
2021-06-22 17:56:42,wallstreetbets,I agree. But if people have no money to pay those mortgages with overpriced homes they purchased then it negates the need. We are still having 400k+ NEW jobless claims. Things are not well at all regardless of what media wants people to believe. A lot of hurting homeowners out there. Tha ks for the DD. I will watch for now. Not jumping in on this play yet.
2021-06-22 18:00:12,wallstreetbets,"It's great to hear a counter opinion, so thank you. I'll do more reading on the situation thanks to you."

2021-06-22 15:03:15,wallstreetbets,Earnings first week of August. I plan puts.
2021-06-22 13:44:50,wallstreetbets,The great part about selling CCs on margin is that the premium immediately goes towards margin maintenance giving you a cushion against margin call
2021-06-22 14:55:26,wallstreetbets,"They buy shares and then sell the calls you are buying.

If the price at expiration is lower than what strike you bought the calls for, he keeps your premium and his shares.

If the price is higher at expiration, he keeps your premium and sells (assigned/exercised) you the shares for whatever profit exists between his purchase price and the strike price.

edit: due to the volatility  (and then the IV of options contracts) in these meme-stocks, the premiums on many of the stocks like CLNE, WISH, BB, CLOV are pretty high, so you can make decent money buying shares and selling covered calls, assuming the share price doesn't collapse before you can do it for a cycle or two."
2021-06-22 15:06:16,wallstreetbets,"I'd say it's best to learn by doing.

Find something you can afford 100 shares of and sell a call. Get a feel for how much you're willing to risk, how much you can make, etc."

2021-06-22 14:00:55,wallstreetbets,Woah learned something new again :)
2021-06-22 16:36:56,wallstreetbets,"It gets even better when you decide you want to fuck buying shares altogether and go just buy options and do spreads all day. you really fuck with the IV at that point when your calendar spread is way out in the future and sell premiums on near expiration options. 

in OP's case, he's not even bothering with expiration, he's buying back the contracts incase it swings back the other way and collecting net profit."
2021-06-22 15:23:30,wallstreetbets,"Just clicked, thank you."

2021-06-22 15:47:50,wallstreetbets,"But... I already sold the calls. The money is mine.

If that's the angle you're taking, it actually benefits me to kill excitement so my shit doesn't get exercised."
2021-06-22 16:17:11,wallstreetbets,dont you want to continue making money this way?
2021-06-22 16:19:06,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but not necessarily on this specific stock. Although I believe it's a good long-term hold, I was mostly capitalizing on the high IV."
2021-06-22 16:28:24,wallstreetbets,"i guess my point was just that the momentum is good even if you dont want the calls to exercise. it increases the amount of strikes and dates, and their value. if the calls exercise, you still profit and can go again."

When it comes to the latter group, get ready to swoop them up. Because as soon as social media moves onto other stocks, these stocks usually take a hit to some extent.

But these inevitable dips have nothing to do with fundamentals. This makes spotting buying opportunities much simpler than with purely speculative meme stocks.

So basically, the strategy is as follows: find a¬†great¬†company whose stock has attracted meme traders, wait for social media to move on (dropping the price below its inflated level), then buy in and enjoy the company‚Äôs future growth."

2021-06-22 13:34:23,wallstreetbets,"The thing is... in a high interest rate environment, UWMC actually benefits.

2021-06-22 13:09:46,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is without a doubt an undervalued stock soley based on company fundamentals alone. Holding 2,000 shares @ 8.50 and multiple calls for July & August."
2021-06-22 14:11:53,wallstreetbets,"I've got a position with $UWMC and it failing to catch fire has sure dampened my spirits.

I don't think it's a bad company or bad investment. However, I could sure use a little upswing to make holding a better looking proposition.

I think the most promising thing coming up for us is on 09AUG if I'm remembering right."
2021-06-22 13:03:44,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is not going anywhere.The contracts are damn cheap. Once I take my gains from other stonks Im going to look at this.


Its a great entry price. I believe with an economic recovery, housing market will see an uptick"
2021-06-22 15:11:10,wallstreetbets,"Bear case:

Uncertainty will prevent it from rising more.

It will fail in its goal to beat RKT and remain behind it long term 

Joining the Russel won't actually affect the stock price by any meaningful amount since only about 6% of the shares a public and that means the index won't actually buy very many  (this is true actually, but isn't very important either way)

There could be a broader economic collapse, hitting housing hard - UWMC is heavily dependent on factors beyond its control.

As a holder of over 10k of UWMC options, I feel it is a no brainer, but bear arguments exist, I just don't agree largely."
2021-06-22 13:03:26,wallstreetbets,"Think about how low interest rates have been this past year and how many people you know have refinanced or bought a new house and got a new mortgage. Personally I both refinanced and bought a new place this past year. 

Now think about what happens when the interest rates will inevitably rise."
2021-06-22 13:50:38,wallstreetbets,"Well I have no position in UWMC right now but I have been watching it closely. 

Honestly, I think simple answer is that the UWMC charts just don‚Äôt looking that great right now (pretty bearish tbh). The price had a big run up over the course of a month and so a lot of people probably took profits. The good news is that the price has found some pretty solid support around $9 so it‚Äôs not like everyone is running for the exits. However, unless a big player comes in with huge buy/sell orders or some big news drops, you probably won‚Äôt see much price action over the next few days. 

Fundamentals certainly drive the price over the long term but they don‚Äôt really drive it over the short term. On that note, a possible rate increase is a bigger issue for most potential investors than many on WSB seem to think. An increase may improve margins but it will also decrease volume. How will that impact the bottom line? A lot of people are simply unsure of that answer so you really need to be careful not to discount that fact."

2021-06-22 14:39:42,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not sure if everyone knows, but the Russel Reconstitution and inclusions are executed instantly. A predetermined amount of shares for every addition to the index will be purchased at once after market close this Friday. With UWMC being added, and as little volume as this ticker gets, I think we can finally expect the share price to reflect the company‚Äôs value."
2021-06-22 17:05:19,wallstreetbets,"UWMC will be above 100 in five years. People think they are only a ""real state"" company. They built their own software, their own network, are going to be white label from most broker.

[https://www.uwm.com/our-team](https://www.uwm.com/our-team)

Event with high interest rates, because they are going to be the white label software for many brokers, they will still getting revenue from the use of their platform, and don't think they will not be selling houses because they will.

The only reasons(to me) to this not be on the $20 floor are:

1. Public stock is relative new
2. HF believe the IPO was overvalued and then shorted it heavenly
3. A lot of open interest from retail investor and not enough volume in shares

&#x200B;

Once the stock get more age, the HF reduce the shorting and options came back to ""normal"" this will fly."
2021-06-22 12:58:12,wallstreetbets,Subscribe.
2021-06-22 13:42:49,wallstreetbets,"Reason is largely due to the [quick](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quickratio.asp) (.0097) and [current](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp) (.045) ratio, their liabilities are quite large. After another quarter or two of results demonstrating their growth will outpace these liabilities this stock is going to take off.

Competition in their sector is quite hot as well, with UWM being the current #3 behind RKT and PFSI, both of which  also boast very solid fundamentals. But as UWM has stated, their business model is less responsive to interest rate pressures compared to the competition.

2021-06-22 13:09:04,wallstreetbets,"I think UWMC is being held down by the hedges as there are a lot of open calls. Maybe we will see a price uptick at the beginning of next week after the russell inclusion on friday, but it will probably not last long. I hold July and August calls and am starting to come to terms with the fact that I am a smooth brained retard ape on that one and will probably start cutting losses middle of next week.

Now that interest rates are no longer falling off a cliff and housing supply remains constrained expect competition to narrow margins.  Banks are currently not lending aggressively as evidenced by the amount in reverse repo, expectations are that this situation reverses itself, maybe in Q4.

Short term fundamentals look good, it's the longer term than gives pause for concern.  What will they earn in 2022?  Likely a fraction of what they earn in 2021.  Great company, but entering the tail of its cycle IMO."

Right now, most of the remaining volume is people selling houses to buy new houses, so it's one big game of musical chairs. Once the economy loses steam inventory will start to slowly return and buying will slow. Many people are going to be upside down on their mortgages.

This is all considering the government actually stops printing money, so who knows. As long as rates are low and the printer is printing, prices will rise. Even so, the best case for mortgage companies is that they keep making money, but they aren't going to have another huge year for quite a while. In other words, it's priced in."

Wouldn‚Äôt this be the lead up to a huge increase?"
2021-06-22 14:32:30,wallstreetbets,"No problem. So with an MSR business, they essentially have the ""right"" to collect fees since they ""service"" mortgages. That means they'll collect payments, potentially put them through the foreclosure process and cover the costs (potentially make a profit), etc. So they would earn some sort of basis point on the outstanding of the principal of the mortgage.

So the rights end when a mortgage is refinanced (which is what we witnessed in the falling interest rate environment). In essence, the income stream are actually less when rates are low, and longer when rates are rising. If you look back during the housing bubble, in 2007, MSRs could've been valued at as much as 6X annual fees. However, when the bubble burst, they were about 2X as much.

It's very perplexing how this isn't getting priced in. The company even mentioned they're forecasting growth / stability in the coming quarters.

Best Q2 in company history, maybe, but certainly not the best quarter ever. Gain margins have been slashed to 90-150 basis points in a pissing match with Rocket. UWMC has better margins to begin with due to their technological moat so that will affect them less than Rocket. Their strategy to beating Rocket is pretty much to bleed their competition (not just Rocket) dry, as opposed to increase their business volume like Rocket does by exploring other loan opportunities like auto financing.

I'm long UWMC and have no position in Rocket, but to sum up the bear case: UWMC is purposely knee-capping their profits in one of the hottest markets in history just to spite the competition who is expanding to other areas anyway."

Housing market has been insane this past year. Keep in mind the market is forward looking, 0.5% may not be much now, but rates are trending upwards, not downwards.

I have no idea what the drop in housing demand will be, but do a quick check on UWMC or RKT revenues/earnings from 2017-2019 and compare those with 2020. The difference is astronomical. 2020 levels are in no way sustainable."

2021-06-22 14:05:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes this is correct.  If rates rise people are still buying homes.  If housing market crashes, people still need mortgages to buy homes.  Only a small portion of the UWMC business model is refinance, they focus mainly on new mortgage origination."

2021-06-22 14:25:01,wallstreetbets,"> Mortgage Servicing Rights

Basically means as a wholesale lender they can refi their competitors loans. They bundle baskets of loans towards mortgage brokers so they can offer a lower rate. By bundling baskets of loans, as opposed to servicing each customer individually, they can offset the risk of default in a basket, as opposed to a single loan AFAIU.

For clarity, they don't ""benefit"" they just handle the higher rate environment better."

2021-06-22 14:37:50,wallstreetbets,"You are somewhat neutral, but not completely as there several variables to account for. Think of it like this (an extreme scenario/pricing difference also assuming a 25% housing increase over the past year):

You own a $250k home and are buying a $500k home.

Last year your house was $200k, the home you are buying was $400k.

While you may think of this as neutral, you're ""gaining"" $50k on your home to pay $100k more.

But there are situations where you would be ""neutral"" to where it essentially nets. Regardless, buyers are in a tough market. Every house on the market is sold instantly and for well over ask (assuming it's a decent house). With such low rates and people having been able to save for sizable down payments, people are being approved for more than they would have 1-2 years ago and people are utilizing that additional borrowing power."

And that is a bad scenario. Others predict +0.5%. Side of that, UWM's business model will do well in rising rates, compared to RKT and other competition. Check out for example reuters stock report plus, UWM's advantages over the competition are massive and covered well in the latest report. CEO of UWMC also claims rising rates will benefit them. People will not stop buying houses with slight rate increase, there is still a fuckload of millenials without real estate like me who would buy property, if having the means, no matter whether interest is 2% or 3%."

I am a mortgage broker in real life and currently ~80% of my business goes to them.

Further, they have THE BEST pricing in the wholesale marketplace for anyone with a 740+ credit score, so even with forecasts of increased defaults/foreclosures in the future, they should be well more insulated from that compared to most other lenders.

No one is even bothering to look at their loan origination in 2017, 2018 and 2019 when the rate was 4% they still grew year over year when the competition had negative loan volume origination.  That's super fucking bullish.

2021-06-22 17:15:14,wallstreetbets,Rocket is the #1 mortgage originator. Clearly people do trust them. Can UWMC surpass them without stepping into other arenas? I'm not sure. The ultimatum will help them in the broker channel but that's a mighty big assumption to think the broker channel will keep growing despite being vastly smaller than it was during the last housing boom with easy credit.
2021-06-22 14:27:41,wallstreetbets,"They cant afford them at the moment due to prices being inflated so madly. Once this slumps, they will be able to. If it slumps. UWMC makes money in both scenarios anyway."

2021-06-22 13:07:16,wallstreetbets,"Everybody knows AMD is a massively undervalued stock right now. The Xilinx merger has been putting a ton of pressure on them and has been keeping the stock trading sideways. If that is approved soon (which some articles say it is only a few weeks away) then this could be one of the biggest plays of the year. I have played AMD a few times and gotten burnt, but I think I may hop on some long $100 calls with you this time."
2021-06-22 13:07:35,wallstreetbets,"I believe in AMD and have 100c leaps, but I think AMD has been trading sideways and unless all regulatory items are approved in the next 9 days, that's way too aggressive of a timeline."
2021-06-22 12:58:25,wallstreetbets,You literally just a posted a bunch of long term trends and haven‚Äôt explained why that‚Äôs going to translate into a massive short term spike. Also I don‚Äôt think NVDA is ‚Äústruggling‚Äù.
2021-06-22 15:20:43,wallstreetbets,Your DD is complete shit. But you're running in the right direction even if you don't know why very clearly. Good work fellow aut!
2021-06-22 13:08:40,wallstreetbets,What the fuck is this DD?!? You didn‚Äôt even mention the merger with Xilinx which is the biggest reason AMD would hit $100
2021-06-22 14:06:55,wallstreetbets,"AMD is going to be huge. Just wait for merger to complete and we are going to see new highs. Easy money üöÄüöÄüöÄ. As the master says, buy when others are fearful."
2021-06-22 14:14:09,wallstreetbets,"AMD is showing signs of a reversal. I don't know if it will be within the month, but the stock will eventually push up above 100."
2021-06-22 12:55:23,wallstreetbets,So 18 increase in 10ish days?
2021-06-22 17:48:18,wallstreetbets,10% of my account is AMD long term play
2021-06-22 13:42:55,wallstreetbets,Nobody tell this guy there is a chip shortage that hasn‚Äôt been going on for 6 months.
2021-06-22 12:57:33,wallstreetbets,"You missed the biggest DD, AMD makes the graphics for both the new xbone and PlayStation which are sold from GME üöÄ üíé üôå"
2021-06-22 14:12:35,wallstreetbets,"I mean I‚Äôm heavy into AMD, but I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre confused and think it‚Äôs actually July 1st. 
Hitting $100 in less than 2 weeks is an unrealistic expectation. I mean I hope I‚Äôm wrong. That being said my bet is on $120 by EoY. I think it‚Äôll hit $100 by the end of July and could hit $120+ by the end of August."
2021-06-22 13:44:52,wallstreetbets,"positions or ban. this is weak ass DD.

AMD fell $15 after earnings. despite crushing it.

announcing a 4 billion buyback only moved it 3%.

you really think with this weak ass DD, it's going to break 90? get real.

(corrected number because I'm too fucking lazy to remember what the buyback amount was)"
2021-06-22 14:23:51,wallstreetbets,AMD absolutely hates $100 so Im highly pessimistic it would even breach $90 by the end of the month.
2021-06-22 13:32:03,wallstreetbets,https://twitter.com/MelStone31/status/1407374782279061506 buyers have been pounding these options

2021-06-22 13:04:03,wallstreetbets,I been hearing this for the last 10 months.
2021-06-22 13:00:09,wallstreetbets,You're going to push people away from AMD.
2021-06-22 12:55:54,wallstreetbets,"Typo, AMC"
2021-06-22 13:56:15,wallstreetbets,According to a number of semi forums Xilinx merger won‚Äôt close until Nov
2021-06-22 16:44:36,wallstreetbets,"Amd 100 target is something that everybody are sure off, me included ( holding shares at 54 average)
Tho, we re yet to see it happen.

2021-06-22 17:34:42,wallstreetbets,$120c 7/30 cheap leaps
2021-06-22 16:31:16,wallstreetbets,AMD $100 calls for 7/16
2021-06-22 15:32:51,wallstreetbets,Same exact scenario here. I have been bent over a couple times by amd calls but this time feels right. The sideways consolidation combined with the chip shortage breakout and merger should be a perfect storm.
2021-06-22 16:26:31,wallstreetbets,I have amd too. I definitely don‚Äôt think it will be 100 by eom. I think it will run up to 90s in July prior to the Er.

2021-06-22 17:00:15,wallstreetbets,Don't follow this guy. EOY is almost guaranteed to be 100. 7/16 is not impossible but incredibly unlikely. I would buy 1/21 calls at minimum since the merger is not expected to complete until November.
2021-06-22 16:37:57,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre referencing EU/UK regulators approving the merger (link removed because we can‚Äôt post seeking alpha posts in wsb)

2021-06-22 13:05:55,wallstreetbets,Been holding plug since it hit $69
2021-06-22 12:18:39,wallstreetbets,True. I‚Äôm just expressing why I like these particular stocks and hope people will do research to see if they believe in them as well. Have noticed workhorse here before and wonder how many people are in it for what the company does and how many are in it hoping for meme-stock levels of money.
2021-06-22 12:44:40,wallstreetbets,"Haha, sorry! ü§êI‚Äôve liked the company for years and wish I could have invested long ago.

Still only have like 85 cause I never have tons of money to invest, but I believe they have such potential."
2021-06-22 12:31:13,wallstreetbets,Exactly! Wish I had invested more at $5. But even getting in now is a great idea with good potential!

2021-06-22 15:49:51,wallstreetbets,It means 99.5 of the shares available to be loan to be shorted is already shorted

2021-06-22 13:32:26,wallstreetbets,"Fact is WKHS is at the moment ahead of competition, just as Tesla for the cars. And on the short term, all these considerations are anyway irrelevant for what regards the  huge short squeeze potential."
2021-06-22 12:35:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah for sure. I think the hope is they will have tech comparable to the rest, and getting in now while it‚Äôs still relatively cheap is a good investment. Fords F150 is going to be huge and their stock has more than doubled in the last year. GMs ads for the electric Hummer is cool too. I think WKHS will be strong enough to warrant investing in, but who knows exactly where it will end up in the lineup."

2021-06-22 13:40:13,wallstreetbets,"WKHS is shorted 60% last I checked and has a low volume of total shares 12M+ comparatively, icing on the cake is the float is almost fully distributed.  So short term could be a epic squeeze play with long term potential.  win-win"
2021-06-22 14:14:19,wallstreetbets,"I do see this as having short term potential, there‚Äôs already so many bag holders I‚Äôm sure more will hold"
2021-06-22 13:33:11,wallstreetbets,You misunderstood I think. Workhorse doesn‚Äôt build Vans like the mentioned above. They build electric delivery vehicles and have a model that was tested with UPS. They also own the technology for delivery drones. This is particularly interesting because Biden wants to push the electrification of the gov. Fleet and wants to fund this with additional 8billion.
2021-06-22 14:05:35,wallstreetbets,"Based on your response I‚Äôd bet you aren‚Äôt that read up on EV tech, I‚Äôd suggest looking deeper into Ford but mostly GM.

2021-06-22 13:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, I was talking about the electric vehicle market as a whole. But that being said, the Ford F-150 lightning could eventually lead the way to an electric transit van. As far as other delivery vehicle companies, I also like Arrival."
2021-06-22 14:07:21,wallstreetbets,"I know they make full sized delivery vehicles, but you disregarded the fact that others can also do this. The drone tech seems like a waste of time unless they can get them to land and take off from a moving truck. Is that going to be their goal or will the trucks have to stop to deploy the drone?"
2021-06-22 14:53:04,wallstreetbets,You are right. The research I‚Äôve done has been lighter than it should be. I need to remedy that.
2021-06-22 13:02:35,wallstreetbets,Ah right
2021-06-22 12:40:34,wallstreetbets,Neither do we. That‚Äôs fud spread about these stonks. These are long hold plays
2021-06-22 13:05:56,wallstreetbets,I agree and it‚Äôs good to see some WKHS posts allowed
2021-06-22 14:08:13,wallstreetbets,"Completely agree, I can see Ford making a large EV as they‚Äôre regular vehicles are underperforming"
2021-06-22 15:20:42,wallstreetbets,"Nothing wrong with that, you‚Äôre ahead of most people who claim they can‚Äôt learn more. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking questions like these. Seems like I need to read up more on workhorse, definitely a lot of short term catalysts and possibly a long term winner."
2021-06-22 12:46:42,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. And I know it seems like wallstreetbets is mostly about short term stuff but for those interested in long term stuff, maybe they‚Äôll like these!"
2021-06-22 12:55:48,wallstreetbets,I disagree. It‚Äôs about long plays that could squeeze. It got misconstrued somewhere and then it was oh this one has short interest this one has short interest. Our volume is our power. Have to have it all liking same stocks

Oh stop it. It's not a short squeeze. First, they are no where near underwater. Shorts have made millions. Furthermore, look at the shitload of call options being sold with high iv premiums. Shorting this avoids them getting options exercised.

Finally, we saw what happens in a runup. Insiders sell, and they still own like 70% of the shares."
2021-06-22 15:26:10,wallstreetbets,"There is zero chance of CRSR squeezing as long as institutions own more than 50% of the shares outstanding and are regularly selling off their stake, which is currently happening.

2021-06-22 14:01:28,wallstreetbets,"It was at $40+ a week ago, it‚Äôs got a wide range it‚Äôs bouncing between, 30-50, with 30 being a solid floor and the 50 is a glass ceiling waiting to be smashed."
2021-06-22 12:34:00,wallstreetbets,CRSR hasn't even trading for a year and was in the $40s four months ago
2021-06-22 14:34:15,wallstreetbets,"Shhhh, no it's a short squeeze buddy. Every stock on WSB is now a shor tsqueeze play."
2021-06-22 15:43:45,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not convinced eagle tree is going to continue selling this year. They‚Äôre very close to losing majority control. Squeeze doesn‚Äôt matter on a sub 3 billion market cap anyway. Organic growth can happen quickly.
2021-06-22 17:22:16,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not bouncing between those lol it used to go near 50 but sticks to 32 like glue for the last 3 months and any move up gets sold off on. When it was in the same position between 40-50 i thought it wouldn‚Äôt go below 40 either so it can definitely go below 30
2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Baron Rothschild and the $KGC Gold Mine Not joking about the gold mine. $KGC (Kinross Gold Corp.) has recently had a massive fire interrupt operations at their Tasiast gold mine. The mine is one of their top three revenue streams, and the public reaction to the news was a HEAVY dip in the stock price to the tune of 32% over the course of the following week. 

The mine is now operational again, much quicker than many have expected. The mill is still down as the discharge area of the mill was the epicenter of the fire, so it will be a bit longer before they can process any high quality metals. Given how fast mining operations resumed, I can only expect the mine to return to full working order in similarly short notice. Even if it doesn't, this stock is now well under analyst projections and what was previously a buyable price point. I see no reason why $6 wouldn't be more attractive than the $8 shares being bought up just earlier this month. Considering this stock was previously featured on wallstreetbets as a heavy gold mining contender with an improving balance sheet, wsb attitudes aligned with analysts so I see this dip as a classic overreaction. 

Something to watch. As an insightful WeBull commenter put it: 

""'Buy when there's blood in the streets' - Baron Rothschild. Or in this case, when there's fire in the mine.""

EDIT: Thanks for the awards my dudes :)"

2021-06-22 14:13:21,wallstreetbets,"Insurance should cover the $50 million in physical damage. The lost production will hit their annual production by 10-15% per the disclosure (note the mine is operational but not their shipping facility apparently). Despite that, it should just be a short-term blip and full production returning by EOY so the sell off seems way overdone."

Then May of 2019 it started a run up that was only arrested very briefly by the lock downs. 

Immediately after, while still locked down, it mooned and has been in a downward trend since. 

Cnn says unprofitable and yahoo says confirmed my bias on downward trend. Also I've been lead to believe the biggest mine is in Russia.

Why is now a better buy in point then 4?"

2021-06-22 12:47:38,wallstreetbets,"I believe the guidance has thus far demonstrated a commitment to improving the balance sheet. This is not a play on the biggest miner, but rather an up-and-comer. Looking farther back in the chart, there is also evidence of cyclical behavior that implies upside past $4.

Edit: btw I didn't downvote you, I respect your opinion and the questions are worthwhile."
2021-06-22 14:12:03,wallstreetbets,Pre corona gold was selling at a significantly lower price... profits in a mining company go up if the commodity they unearth becomes more valuable

2021-06-22 14:26:04,wallstreetbets,Gold is quite stable at its current valuation... just my opinion but with global markets being propped up by printed money it is probably safe to say gold will go up but I'm no expert
2021-06-22 14:29:53,wallstreetbets,This has also crossed my mind- the gold they are sitting on is an asset in itself in what could very likely turn into an inflationary environment that lasts longer than we'd like.

I know quiet a few use cases for BB Ivy platform but why Geico partnering beats me. I know Warren Buffet would never invest and partner if he didn't see something for long term and benefits his company. Anyone wanna take a guess? What can geico use this data for to provide a better service?

An insurance company seeing the evolution of vehicles, and getting in on a big platform early, in order to analyze the development and ""how it works"" of autonomous vehicles to figure out how to make the biggest bang for their customers buck.

People say the stuff doesn't fit.  They say it's rubbish and doesn't work.  A $5 wedding dress.  Seriously.  How is this even a thing?  How does this company even have a profit target?  This stock should be $0, not $12.  Is this just a hype ride?"

2021-06-22 11:19:06,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt underestimate the ability of people buying useless shit
2021-06-22 11:54:35,wallstreetbets,The Dollar Store sells nothing but garbage as well and they do pretty well.
2021-06-22 11:56:23,wallstreetbets,"Its all about prospective my man. You are probably a middle class dude living in America who has a amazon prime account. WISH is for the rest of the world who rather buy cheap good that may give them cancer vs. paying even a dollar more for something else and get better quality or service or shipping.

Although, in terms of buying weird collectables (thats what I used WISH for before this), it ain't bad.

&#x200B;

Oh, and its a marketplace not a direct seller. Kind of like ebay. Ebay has a shit ton of crap dude."
2021-06-22 12:06:22,wallstreetbets,"Agree 100x but, valid points here.. the dollar store exists.. and its crap, yet I buy occasionally, and there's always a line there. Strange"
2021-06-22 11:56:20,wallstreetbets,One ape‚Äôs trash is another ape‚Äôs rocket fuel ü¶çü¶ßüöÄüöÄüöÄüåï
2021-06-22 11:15:07,wallstreetbets,It's not what they sell it's the marketplace and platform they provide others to buy and sell.
2021-06-22 11:19:58,wallstreetbets,"Remember dude, if you‚Äôre spending time on WSB, then you‚Äôre well off than most of the world. Some people only care about price and not quality. That‚Äôs why dollar stores exist. Think of them as a global dollar store in the online world. 

3billion plus revenue tells you there are buyers for what is being offered on the site. And they are also the most downloaded shopping app in the world."
2021-06-22 11:25:56,wallstreetbets,"They have a lot of customers outside of the US who 1) can only afford that cheap shit, 2) are not buying the same things as the American market."
2021-06-22 11:35:05,wallstreetbets,"ContextLogic has  scalability due to its business model and ability to grow/gain market share. It's focus on cheaper products compared to higher value items sold by Amazon. This is actually a good thing as it's not directly up against Amazon for its target customers. This business model is proven to be successful in other countries (Pinduoduo sells lower value items compared to JD, TMall and is gaining marketshare).

It has zero debt and it's revenue is projected to grow at 30% and 14 % in 21 and 22 , right now it's selling at 0.8x 2023 forward sales compared to 3x-3.5x price of the forward sales in the e-commerce sector (likes of Amazon and eBay). It has good value , and is in a high growth sector. It may not exactly be next Amazon or eBay but it will be a solid company"
2021-06-22 11:45:49,wallstreetbets,"This is what my wife said when I mentioned WISH to her. But on the flip side, people will continue to buy cheaper options. Plenty of shit businesses made good money."
2021-06-22 11:44:16,wallstreetbets,Nowadays who sells quality? Is the name that counts by the way did you buy wish stock today? Prepare for the moon
2021-06-22 11:15:03,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-22 11:20:11,wallstreetbets,"Amc and Gme arent also worth its current price, yet no one cares. Ppl keep buying and holding those stocks. As long as we can make money, what seems to be the problem. This is WSB, not r/invensting

See you on the üåôüåô"
2021-06-22 12:03:27,wallstreetbets,Magnets are pretty good from there ngl. Plus some other random shit I've gotten like mirrored wrap etc.
2021-06-22 12:28:49,wallstreetbets,"Have you been to Dollar Tree? Their merchandise is trash, yet it succeeds. Never underestimate the power of cheap stuff, bro."
2021-06-22 13:07:47,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt like the company, however, I do like the stock."
2021-06-22 11:28:10,wallstreetbets,"Wish make money and have no debt, they have a good Marketplace in terms of AI but poor in terms of customer service, shipping and quality of products. It won‚Äôt be another Amazon but it would be hard for them to go under at this point"
2021-06-22 11:57:29,wallstreetbets,Wish doesn't own the inventory for the most part. It's like being mad at ebay for buying from a crappy vendor that sells on ebay.
2021-06-22 12:50:45,wallstreetbets,They have a massive customer base. Cheap products have their place in the world.
2021-06-22 13:21:27,wallstreetbets,"You get what u pays for... what quality do u expect with 5$?? Ppl don‚Äôt shop at wish for quality, that‚Äôs not their target audiences."
2021-06-22 14:59:21,wallstreetbets,They have great fuel filters.
2021-06-22 18:16:17,wallstreetbets,"You arent buying the crap they sell. You are buying the profitable company selling crap at a profit.


See Amazon and Walmart."
2021-06-22 11:29:08,wallstreetbets,"Most of what Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and Costco sell is borderline disingenuous garbage too. 

Quality is dead, and it's been buried in a poorly-constructed coffin built in the third world."
2021-06-22 11:28:33,wallstreetbets,I disagree. I have bought stuff off of wish on multiple occasions. There's sellers that cut corners and they don't last long. The one's that do are well worth the money.
2021-06-22 11:16:32,wallstreetbets,If you think quality products are essential to making money you should Google ‚ÄúDollar Tree.‚Äù
2021-06-22 13:53:35,wallstreetbets,I agree. It‚Äôs a terrible fucking company and it‚Äôs sad to see it get the support from here
2021-06-22 11:14:36,wallstreetbets,Oh Yeah? Well go look at their stock review! 5 out of 5 stars! To the moon we go! üöÄüöÄ
2021-06-22 11:17:01,wallstreetbets,"Reasons for the low price is that Chinese manufacturers can mass produce products for very little and they go directly to wish to sell, cutting the middle man out. Obviously that presents a quality issue as these are not going through a supplier, and are not audited because you know, China. People can talk about how cheap it is, but they are making revenue and expanding, so there arguments to both sides."
2021-06-22 11:48:24,wallstreetbets,"It's worth what we make it worth, fucker üòéüíé"
2021-06-22 11:26:43,wallstreetbets,"I entered wish yesterday, BlackBerry and Wish both have the majority of my shares"
2021-06-22 11:35:52,wallstreetbets,"I mean where else can you buy a fleshmaster 5000, a ""fuel filter"" and a 10 pack of butt plugs for 9.99 plus shipping 

Shit sells itself... also not everything is bad quality"
2021-06-22 11:33:38,wallstreetbets,"My father used to say, ""nobody ever lost money underestimating the good taste of the American public."".  I feel like this applies in this circumstance."
2021-06-22 13:27:14,wallstreetbets,You do buy the same garbage elsewhere. You just pay double
2021-06-22 11:47:23,wallstreetbets,"Wish doesn't sell anything, they are a market place for third party sellers. It doesn't matter if its good or not, people will buy it if it's all they can afford. Post pandemic more than ever."
2021-06-22 12:10:03,wallstreetbets,Just invest in it and you won‚Äôt regret it.
2021-06-22 12:15:51,wallstreetbets,Ever heard of AIi Baba
2021-06-22 13:28:22,wallstreetbets,"dollar general, $DG. its not the products, its the logistics. in the case of wish, its the technology behind their pricing and selling environment. in my opinion, anyway."
2021-06-22 13:35:24,wallstreetbets,"I have bought plenty of items from wish that were typically 2-3. Nothing crazy expensive I even bought a cat flea collar that worked better than the one recommended by the vet and cost way less. I mean I don't recommend buying anything like a computer there but for cheap, cute things it's a pretty nice place to shop and cat clothes. Wish has so many things you just never knew you needed in life. ^^"
2021-06-22 14:18:11,wallstreetbets,"When I need a particular electronic part I rather buy it on Wish than pay scalper prizes in domestic retail. Nothing I bought from Wish has exploded yet, unlike the N7, Teslas or computer parts I bought from 'trusted' companies."
2021-06-22 14:36:10,wallstreetbets,"This sub and critical thinking goes to opposite directions, so welcome to the casino"
2021-06-22 14:39:23,wallstreetbets,"Look through your house. It‚Äôs full of more foreign made stuff than you think. There‚Äôs a reason why trash cans are so full on garbage pick up days. 

If you go through AMZN, their stuff is a fuck ton of Chinese crap, too.

WISH has its place."
2021-06-22 14:39:34,wallstreetbets,"They have 4.6/5 stars on google play with over 12,000,000 reviews"
2021-06-22 15:14:13,wallstreetbets,OP hasn‚Äôt seen Wish profit confirmed
2021-06-22 15:55:07,wallstreetbets,"It is trash, so is the company, they make a fortune off total too-good-to-be-true junk. Fuck this company, ride the way and get out, it's not a long-term investment."
2021-06-22 16:01:18,wallstreetbets,Think third world Amazon. I‚Äôd be more comfortable if everyone was treated with dignity and respect but wish has potential in that this is not the way the world works
2021-06-22 16:02:23,wallstreetbets,"Also I‚Äôd love to see stats on how much Amazon stuff, high quality or not, is discarded or lay unused.  People like buying stuff"
2021-06-22 16:30:17,wallstreetbets,Agreed. The value of their good will is literally negative
2021-06-22 16:46:20,wallstreetbets,"No one every said ""wow this food from McDonald's is really nutritious, organic and good for the masses to eat"". 

Fkin rtard"
2021-06-22 16:47:27,wallstreetbets,This is a pump and dump by bots on WSB. That's why I bought puts.
2021-06-22 17:00:47,wallstreetbets,I bought a 512 GB MICRO SD card for $4 off wish. Deal of a lifetime. The thing was more like 500 MB and probably gave my device a virus. But I stand by my $WISH investment.
2021-06-22 17:12:01,wallstreetbets,Apparently you've never heard of Nike or Apple. All their shit is made in China too.
2021-06-22 17:27:05,wallstreetbets,"You have to know what your buying, but I have grabbed things off wish that were triple the price for exact same item on Amazon. Just had to wait the 6 weeks for shipping.  Thing to remember if it sounds to good to be true it probably is so don‚Äôt buy that."
2021-06-22 17:37:26,wallstreetbets,I have heard a few good things about WISH products but I have never bought from them.
2021-06-22 17:38:44,wallstreetbets,"> this stuff I bought on wish 

That's all that matters. They bought something. Quality is irrelevant if people are still buying."
2021-06-22 17:59:45,wallstreetbets,Could be the next Netflix  type of return. Ya never know
2021-06-22 18:30:07,wallstreetbets,Best bull pitch I've seen in a while
2021-06-22 11:48:56,wallstreetbets,"Dollar store is literally where I buy cheap household items that would be $4-5 more elsewhere

WISH concept is amazing. Sure the AUX cable may break in 3 monthe but hey you still can use it for 3 months"
2021-06-22 11:29:57,wallstreetbets,The only thing I ever saw from this company was an ad that kept popping up on my Facebook feed for what I can only describe as toe clamps
2021-06-22 11:39:35,wallstreetbets,"I made my DD and post it here if you are interesting

I really like the stock"
2021-06-22 12:05:52,wallstreetbets,"This is a MSM pump and dump, a distraction."
2021-06-22 12:45:08,wallstreetbets,"I bought a quicksilver polarized sunglasses from $WISH for $8 plus shipping which it came out to $10.19. Went to quicksilver store at shopping mall, saw the same thing for $110 before tax. Mine from $WISH is probably a knock off but no one cares cause there is no way of telling it. Btw, the one from quicksilver store is made in china too so....... your pick. Granted they also sell junk but guess what just because I think is a junk, does not mean other people don't need/want it."
2021-06-22 15:19:50,wallstreetbets,"I think you're underestimating how important tchotchkes and trash are to the economy. Waffle House sells the most T Bone steaks in the world. McDonald's is the world's largest fast food chain. Are either of these ""the best"" products?"
2021-06-22 11:14:42,wallstreetbets,Citidel has a large holding of it. Hence the pump of it everywhere you look
2021-06-22 12:31:50,wallstreetbets,So‚Ä¶ how are your puts doing?
2021-06-22 14:11:42,wallstreetbets,"Being the least expensive place to buy things worked out pretty good for Walmart. Everyone knows whatever you buy is going to fall apart in a year, but hey it's cheap."
2021-06-22 14:13:30,wallstreetbets,Wish and CLOV are both pump & dumps. Gonna be a lot of bag holders in the very near foreseeable future‚Ä¶ üôÑ

2021-06-22 11:24:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they sell shit heaps, but the platform itself and team behind it are worth it. 

I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm out at 15$-20$."
2021-06-22 11:22:31,wallstreetbets,Wish is basically amazon for shitty chinese products that dont fit the description theyre advertised under
2021-06-22 12:32:59,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd like to know how wish was able to reduce it‚Äôs non current liabilities by 1.6 billy from 2019-2020
2021-06-22 12:37:40,wallstreetbets,"Idk, but I WISH everyone would shut the hell up about it"
2021-06-22 13:25:00,wallstreetbets,"Beware the pump and dump. Or don't, your call. Or buy puts."

2021-06-22 14:44:00,wallstreetbets,I believe about 5-10% of what they sell turns out to be decent quality. But there‚Äôs no real way of knowing before you buy it.

2021-06-22 18:21:41,wallstreetbets,My DBZ computer mat would like a word with you. Nobody believes wish or any other meme is mooning. Those are the hedgefund pump and dumps to raise capital
2021-06-22 18:41:52,wallstreetbets,Watch the reviews of the knockoff Centaur guitar effects pedal.

2021-06-22 12:27:41,wallstreetbets,"The Dollar Store is the only option many communities have to buy their necessities. Those stores are set up in poor areas that no longer have a bigger grocery or home goods store available. Said differently, it's the only game in town and people are forced to shop there because it's all they can afford. Totally different business model than WISH."
2021-06-22 13:55:51,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-22 18:33:29,wallstreetbets,What do you collect?

2021-06-22 11:34:17,wallstreetbets,Look at Alibaba. They sell garbage from China and make a killing.
2021-06-22 18:28:44,wallstreetbets,Why would you buy puts if you didn‚Äôt own any of the actual company?  Just curious.
2021-06-22 11:36:42,wallstreetbets,"You know there are tools for tracking what HFs hold via filings right? Ironically some of Citadel's top holdings are AMD, ROKU, NVDA. I don't see any WISH in their filings."

Sometimes you just need some cheap random stuff like  napkins, plastic cups, a snack.  I never thought of it as a place for poor people."

Walmart, Target, Home Depot, etc all sell junk, especially online.

And take it from somebody who worked with merchants at one of those retailers, the merchants didn‚Äôt care much about quality, just what sells, and part of that is the merchants didn‚Äôt have the time or knowledge to learn about each product in store and definitely not online with 15x the SKU count.

If you think the coffee grinder you buy on Target.com went through a quality check before being on boarded, you are retarded. Obviously, they on board and delist vendors that sell tons of crap, but they don‚Äôt really care if Whirlpool sells a busted model of washers as long as people buy them and don‚Äôt return them en masse. 

Some smaller retailers or higher end retailers do care about quality. Nordstrom or Costco only sell quality products and there is a more rigorous assortment selection criteria."

There is a well documented trend of dollar stores being clustered in poor communities. Either because they're the last business standing after bigger stores like Walmart leave an area; or because they deliberately build in poor areas as that is their target market. Google ""dollar store poor communities"" and you'll get a huge string of reporting on this fact. It's a critical part of understanding the business model for dollar store profitability and pricing."

Each year in June, the Russell Indexes release an updated list of the constituents for their various indexes, notably the **Russell 2000**. ETFs and Mutual funds purchase stocks and allocate funds based on market cap. RIDE, w/a market cap of \~$1.75B, will receive between $75 and $115M in investment.

**Based on level 2 data yesterday, $900k of share purchases suggests an increase in share price by $1.**

**Estimating $97.5M of purchases, even if the supply/demand sell side curve is 8x what it was yesterday, RIDE should get to $20. This is 2x the price today.**

This rise should increase should more purchases be made by the Reddit community.

Also worth noting:

* 31% short (Mostly retail shorts now, they are paranoid. Most know this is coming!)
* Significant institutional ownership
* Die hard Reddit community 
* Lordstown week just occurred where they provided a demos and drives, and re-assured investors of their Q4 production targets
* On Friday, a virtual tour of the plant occurs. Expect some additional updates (ideally on leadership or funding)
* On Monday, Russell investing starts in full force
* Last year, WKHS went from $8 to $20 over just a couple days as they were added to the Russell

Get in now, but save a little for Friday, Monday and Tuesday. RIDE the spike and RIDE to the moon!



PS: Don't be fooled by recent FUD. They are re-posting stuff that happened months ago.  Many constituents developing FUD have very suspect motives.  $F is scared, they have to cannibalize their business to sell EV‚Äôs. Anything $RIDE sells is new market share.   Huge truck shortage across the US. Projection for 20,000 trucks produced next year, which would generate $1B in revenue.  


Before you bring your FUD here, see below: 


1. ‚ÄúBut the scam preorders‚Äù - all EV‚Äôs have preorder shit.  Trucks are needed, confirmed Interest from enough parties to scoop up all of 2022 production.  Yes it‚Äôs not the 100k that Burns said, but it is still 100% of projected production. 


2. ‚ÄúTheir scammy CEO / CFO left‚Äù - who the fuck cares, this company is beyond a single person at this point.  Burns was a visionary and kickstarted this thing, but it‚Äôs time for someone else to carry through production. 

3. ‚ÄúHub motors are trash‚Äù - Worth a fucking shot don‚Äôt you think?  Did you see the military vehicle. The ‚Äúlego‚Äù skateboard with different cabs is pretty damn appealing. Simplicity. 

4. ‚ÄúBut executives sold so much of their stock‚Äù - are we really getting panties in a bunch about $8M.  This is a $1.8B company.  That‚Äôs 00.4% of the company.  And do you blame them? Bag a little bit of life changing cash and hold some more in case it all pans out.  This was purely a risk tolerance decision. 

5. Bring it on - EV‚Äôs are the future.  If this company is fucked, we have bigger issues. 
Like seriously how is this company only valued at $1.8B, when Rivian (another pre revenue company) is being valued at $70B. 10% of that valuation would put the SP @ $40.

NSCC-801 was passed some time ago without objection. In order for this rule to go into effect, it must piggyback with NSCC-002, it will go into effect tomorrow, 6/23/2021. Let me remind you how powerful 801 really is.... Once 801 enters effect, all hedgefunds holding short positions will be monitored Every. Single. Minute. They will have to report EVERY SINGLE MINUTE their value in short positions versus their actual money on hand. If they fail to report or their short position value crosses the threshold where it is higher than their money on hand, it is an immediate warning to deposit the funds needed to cover within ONE HOUR. Failure to do so leads to the NSCC immediately overriding operations and liquidating the hedge funds entirely

What I like about Fisker over RIDE is Henrik is at least smart enough (after learning from his prior company going bankrupt after going to production of the Karma) to realize that producing vehicles is really hard, so he just instead sticks to coming out with new drawings of proposed EV's every now and then. RIDE is way too deep in the rabbit-hole now and they are likely trying to figure out how to generate enough interest to raise additional funds before they announce a delay till end of 2022. Might be too late for them for that though. No worries for bag-holders here of course... Steve Burns will probably create a new company to sell you shares in again."

More importantly the Endurance made it 40 miles at slow speeds in the SF250. Seems they might need to improve on that, a tad little, before the military looks at this.

As to the open house... 45 mph top-speed demo for the Endurance truck? They are supposedly 3 months away from production and they can't drive this pickup truck faster... As to it being rough surfaces, well in the SF250 the trophy trucks there were going upwards of, I think (off-hand), 75 mph, versus the Endurance going 20 mph...

2021-06-22 14:19:23,wallstreetbets,Says the guy living in a RIDE echo chamber... how the fuck can anyone invest in this garbage.
2021-06-22 14:42:40,wallstreetbets,"I don't care how many MPG you get. If you are going to try to sell an off-road vehicle that in civilian dress gets only 40 miles of range at 20 miles per hour, when they can buy gas vehicles that can go 60 mph+ and for further distances, I think it is pretty clear which vehicle the military will not be buying.

As to manufacturer of brakes requiring slower speeds... Where does this BS even come from? This company is supposed to start production in 3 months and this is the nonsense you excuse them with.

Basically, there is no other side than trust a company that has lied and was led by a guy who has never been able to produce anything, which is putting out a vehicle with an unproven technology for it (and in-fact in their response to the short-report they said they had to do extra work tuning the suspension, making the vehicle stronger, AND ADDING WEIGHT, for the in-wheel motors to work. How the heck does this make sense for an EV and sure does not sound like it makes them easier to build). Their new top person, Angela Strand, has a resume that lists companies that have failed in the time she was there (not saying she was responsible, but obviously she has never saved a company in a tough situation... why anyone thinks she will do well with RIDE is beyond me)."
2021-06-22 14:55:10,wallstreetbets,"Considering the in-wheel motors impact the handling and comfort makes sense what you are saying. Maybe a normal truck could go faster there, but hey, cool in-wheel motor tech that keeps you slow and inefficient requires compromises. I guess, sorry for having the gall to call them out.

I mean, it is too much to expect a company 3 months from production, who is showing off their vehicles, to show them off properly. My bad."

2021-06-22 16:09:03,wallstreetbets,you do have a great imagination to invent rationales to paint the negative perception.  the gall to call them out seems more like a pathetic little whine from an armchair 'expert'
2021-06-22 15:56:17,wallstreetbets,"I'm not getting into this arguement with a RIDE bro.  There isn't a single thing that Canoo has done that was been near as bad as RIDE or WKHS or the lot of the other EVs, and they have a much better chance of surviving that the rest of them. Is there risk, yes a significant one but I know that and acknowledge that.  You fucking RIDE bros act like Lordstown is delivering 200k vehicles a year and deserve a 200B valuation..."
2021-06-22 16:44:03,wallstreetbets,"Sure thing. Any substantive info to respond with or only insults, Angela Strand? Nice resume by the way. How many of those companies went under? Good luck saving Lordstown... Although that is obviously not your goal. More like, suck in as many investors as you can so you can take a big payday before it implodes."
2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Macys (M) One more time! I am not a professional equity analyst so do your own research.  BUT I am hot on this stock so I‚Äôm going to give it another whirl. Here are some reasons to take a look into a stock like Macy‚Äôs and why it‚Äôs insane the stock is 17.8% shorted

1. A rising tide lifts all boats. Zack‚Äôs industry ranks the retail sector at 9 of 250 industries. Retail is making a comeback and has plenty of pent-up demand still as offices re-open and people start getting rid of their sweatpants to go shopping for work clothes, and other everyday wear. The retailers that have been struggling and unable to survive through the pandemic will go bankrupt if they have not already, allowing Macy‚Äôs and surviving retailers to absorb their market share.
2. Inflation ‚Äì Inflation will have a positive impact on Macy‚Äôs debt and real estate values. Real Estate goes up over time and while their Real Estate Values will go up significantly, their debt will remain the same (or valued at less if you measure it against the CPI).
3. Pricing ‚Äì The stock is priced well with $20 billion of annual sales and their market capitalization is less than $6 billion!
4. Earnings ‚Äì Their earnings out-performed analyst expectations by a wide margin and Analysts are only starting to adjust their expectations.  The company also holds plenty of cash and is not going anywhere any time soon.
5. Online Presence ‚Äì They have an increasing online presence and 37% of their sales are now digital!
6. EDIT - Momentum - I'm not a technical guy... but this stock has been doing nothing but going up.  LFG!

I like constructive criticism, so tell me why I'm wrong! Or right!"

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why RKT is a Fintech Company and Deserves a Fintech Valuation Every CrapCo tries to pitch themselves as tech these days, but I would like to explain why RKT is the real deal.  

***TLDR: RKT is having its ""Amazon is just a book company"" moment.  Investors are over-discounting the MASSIVE upside from tech-ecosystem opportunities for this already highly profitable and fast-growing company.***    

First things, here is my position (\~$350k market value): 17,500 shares @ $18.54, 50x Sep 2021 $19.89c, 20x Jan 2022 $20.89c.  Now that you know I'm serious, let me start with some context.

What do the best tech investors look for?

I'll quote someone smarter than me: ""*Top tier firms like Vista Equity, Thoma, and Silver Lake focus on buying businesses with the following characteristics - mission critical products with high switching costs, growing end market, high ROI economics, market leadership, and sticky and recurring revenue base... Every software company can be run at 30-35% EBITDA margin*""  ([Twitter: sendoh34](https://twitter.com/sendoh34/status/1350163448663982081?s=20))

I work at Best Buy so I know he is right.  Whether the focus is early stage VC, tech PE or public equity, ***tech investors want nothing more than*** ***high-growth, scalable, recurring revenue*** and they look for companies with competitive advantages and moats within their industries to deliver and protect this tasty RR*.*

**What does this have to do with Rocket Companies?**

In case you care at all about what they do, Rocket Companies (NYSE: RKT) is a holding company of consumer-oriented financial services, real estate and mortgage businesses.  Most think first of Rocket Mortgage (formerly Quicken Loans) which is the #1 lender in the U.S. with \~10% share of the $3.5TN mortgage market.  Rocket Mortgage is known for their best-in-class brand, customer service and innovative, tech-driven approach to the industry.  About +/- 90% of RKT's $16BN of revenue in 2020 came from its core mortgage business.

***Rocket is currently treated by investors and analysts as a TECH-ENABLED mortgage company but*** ***not*** ***a FINTECH company.***  Read any analyst research report and it is obvious.  Why is this important?  Because while tech-enabled businesses can deliver significantly better operating results, market share gains and staying power than competitors, their core business is unchanged and so the valuation metrics by analysts and the institutions are unchanged.  This is evident by RKT's current valuation: **at yesterday's close of $19.22, RKT was trading at 4.7x 2020 EPS and \~9.0x consensus 2021 EPS.**  *Comparatively, fintech companies trade at 25-30x PE multiples or even much, much higher.*  Are they right? 

**Why Rocket Should Be Considered a Fintech Company**

I'll give 5 reasons why you should start thinking about Rocket as a Fintech Company.

**1. ROCKET ALREADY HAS AN EXTENSIVE TECHNOLOGY BASE BUILT OVER DECADES**

Many don't realize that while Rocket Mortgage is their largest business, Rocket Companies also includes dozens of other businesses formed over decades of investment.  Here are just a few of them: 

* [Amrock Title](https://www.amrock.com/) \- tech-enabled title insurance, valuations and settlement services. Industry pioneer in digital closings and eNotes which more than doubled last year.   
* [Nexsys Technologies](https://www.nexsystech.com/) \-  creates digital platforms for real estate appraisal (Nexsys Clear Path), insurance (Nexsys Clear HOI) and mortgage closings.
* [Rock Connections](https://rockconnections.com/) \- contact services provider leveraging technology and data to connect consumers and brands more effectively.
* [Lendesk](https://www.lendesk.com/) \- Canadian technology company which operates Finmo, Lender Spotlight, Gateway and Enterprise solutions, with more than 10,000 mortgage brokers using its products 
* Others include [Edison Financial](https://edisonfinancial.ca/) (Canadian digital mortgage startup), [Core Digital Media](http://www.coredigitalmedia.com/) (online consumer acquisition platform), [ForSaleByOwner](https://www.forsalebyowner.com/) and more

These companies and others in the [Rocket Ecosystem](https://www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/) create technology that Rocket can leverage in its core mortgage business which why ***Rocket consistently destroys its competitors on nearly every metric and has been able to scale a higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer business while others have not***.  These companies are also big contributors themselves already as you can see from the 1Q ER:  

* *Amrock, our title insurance services, property valuation, and settlement services company, generated 348,800 closings, up 110% from Q1 '20, representing the highest level of closings in Amrock's history. This record volume was the primary driver for the* *increase in other income in Q1 '21 to $466.1 million from $243.8 million in Q1 '20.* \[THAT IS A 91% YOY INCREASE!\]

**2.  ROCKET IS INVESTING A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL AND FOCUS INTO THEIR TECH**  

Over the LTM ended 1Q21, ***Rocket generated $12BN of EBITDA on $19BN of Revenue (\~65% EBITDA margin!) which they are investing right back into their business.***  Over 2/3 of their 276 current job openings are tech-related: big data scientist, software engineer, developer, designer, product manager, etc.  A little strange for a boring old mortgage company, eh?  Rocket has a technology team numbered in the thousands.

Rocket's management team has stated that their capital priorities are 1) reinvesting into the business, 2) strategic M&A, and 3) only then, return of capital to investors.  Given how much money they are making, they could do all like they did earlier this year with the special dividend.

Rocket is clearly focused on tech going forward.  In the past two weeks alone, they have announced several public-private partnerships including backing MSU Apple Developer Academy in Detroit and a partnership between *Rocket Innovation Labs* (yet another ecosystem company) and University of Windsor in Canada.  They have participated in virtually every Investment Bank-sponsored Technology Conference this year.  There are countless others I could mention but you get the point.

**3.  ROCKET AUTO AND ROCKET HOMES: THE LARGEST OPPORTUNITIES YET TO LAUNCH**

Rocket is quietly building massive businesses that could become multibillion standalone businesses.  

**Rocket Auto** currently provides third party technology services, but they are preparing to launch their own managed e-commerce marketplace.  Read from the 1Q21 release:

* *Rocket Auto, our automotive retail marketplace, facilitated the sale of* ***13,600 auto units, up more than 5,300 units, or 65%, as compared to first quarter of 2020****. Gross Merchandise Value for Q1 '21 was $360 million, which represents an annualized run rate of more than $1 billion.*

***ROCKET AUTO IS DOING $1BN OF AUTO SALES ALREADY AND HAVEN'T EVEN LAUNCHED OR MARKETED TO THEIR EXISTING MORTGAGE CUSTOMERS.***   On this topic, Jay Farner said, ""We wanted to construct a business that had all of the appropriate profitability metrics before really leaning in to our client base.""  Rocket Auto also has an existing strategic partnership with Vroom whereby they can earn up to 8.6mm shares in Vroom over 4 years worth about $365MM at today's price.

**Rocket Homes** is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network which did over **$6BN of transaction volume** in 2020.  It has all of the capabilities of a Zillow or Redfin with Rocket's massive footprint and data trove backing it and it hasn't fully launched.  This is another MASSIVE, sleeper opportunity.  Redfin and Zillow are currently valued at 6-8x *revenue.*

**4.  SOME OF THE SMARTEST TECH INVESTORS HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT IN**

The five largest public holders are Caledonia, Vanguard, Invesco, Blackrock and TCMI.  ***Wait who is TCMI?***  TCMI is an affiliate of [Technology Crossover Ventures](https://www.tcv.com/), one of Silicon Valley's top-tier VC firms.  Yes, one of the leading tech investors in the world held 4,450,000 shares of Rocket as of 3/31/21.

**5.  THE FLYWHEEL EFFECT IS ALREADY PROVING OUT**

If you follow Rocket, you'll hear management talk a lot about [Life-time Value (LTV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value).  This is a term which expresses the net profit earned over a customer over their entire relationship with the company.  **This is what it is all about.**  *Rocket has a customer retention ratio of 91% LTM as of 1Q21 which is roughly 4x the industry average.*  It is not hard to see why this is important.  **Think about those qualities that tech investors look for... ""***growing end market, high ROI economics, market leadership, and sticky and recurring revenue base.****""  Add to that an unrivaled brand, highly profitable existing business to fuel reinvestment, extensive customer base, and 2k+ tech force.***  *""We should be able to look out at every American and target market or have a specific message and value about how we can help them improve on their home, saving money in some way, shape or form, buy a car or help them with a real estate transaction,‚Äù Farner said.* ***‚ÄúWhen you put those things together, that‚Äôs 30 percent of the U.S. GDP that we‚Äôre talking about here. All surrounded in a multibillion-dollar brand.‚Äù***    

**CONCLUSION**:  Rocket Companies is incredibly cheap for both the existing business at \~9.0x on 2021 consensus EPS and the upside opportunity.  Given the growth opportunities, it should easily command a 2-3x higher multiple as supported by fintech trading comps.  And to top it all off, RKT has tremendous short-term moonshot potential.  Third time is a charm...

2021-06-22 11:35:57,wallstreetbets,"I commented on this last week. It had a pretty good looking options chain, in terms of gamma ramp and vanna.

Here is today's ramp. Not as juicy, but $20.00/$21.00 looks easy, and vanna is high... so if there's real volatility more shares might be purchased to deltahedge against it.

I'm not a fan of this options chain because it mostly hinges on whales going in, or actual volatility that will make the MMs want to hedge more aggressively. Other than that, it's near the peak and can slide either way just as easily.

2021-06-22 12:26:48,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the great DD
2021-06-22 15:49:49,wallstreetbets,"I refinanced a mortgage through Rocket, and it was pretty smooth. Got into IPO and made some solid gains on options. Amazed it hasn't taken off for the stock and held."
2021-06-22 10:58:49,wallstreetbets,And the short term technicals look good too. One slight push is all it needs. It is trading so far below its fair market value it hurts.

2021-06-22 11:04:45,wallstreetbets,"Reposting my comment because it is super relevant here. The main FUD I absolutely dont get. ""RKT IS CYCLICAL."" They only talk about the negatives of the MORTGAGE company, and refuse to utter the words Fintech. RKTs building a MegaDome of finacial tools, programs, and companies, while sitting on a shit pot of money for acquisitions. Hell they structured the share class specifically for acquisitions. Let's see, we have the number one mortgage company in the us, that also is becoming a direct competitor to Zillow with RocketHome. Then we have RKT auto because they said shit what else....CAR SALES! Let's do that, oh its ALREADY HIGHLY PROFITABLE in the pre full release phase?  The most dangerous weapon a powerhouse company like this has is the cash on hand to become WHATEVER they want to be next. 

Nope, SELL, High Sell Rating.<<edit<<<this was sarcasm. I am sorry I confused you

25 yrs from now ROCKET Rockets, come buy all your Rocket needs."
2021-06-22 15:34:00,wallstreetbets,Solid DD. I'm ready to take off üöÄüöÄ

2021-06-22 11:44:03,wallstreetbets,Is it already that time of the quarter for all RKT DDs and YOLOs to come out of nowhere?
2021-06-22 17:59:30,wallstreetbets,Retards on this sub only want to purchase companies on the brink
2021-06-22 11:10:33,wallstreetbets,"I'm kind of meh on RKT as a company. But what I do like is the option chain: it has really juicy options that could make dramatic moves in a hurry. I think u/pennyether commented on this last week, and I don't know whether the math remains the same - but from a quick eyeball it looks similar.

Doesn't really matter if big money isn't interested in moving on it, though."
2021-06-22 12:53:04,wallstreetbets,"Having recently gone through the mortgage process (and owning rocket stock), I thought I would test them out. They were absolutely shit to interact with. Website was unable to provide a remotely competitive rate, so I called. They had a bunch of dingalings who (on 4 separate occasions) congratulated me on buying a home in Arkansas‚Ä¶ no clue where they got that state from. They they offered me a ‚ÄúYourtgage‚Äù with an shitty rate. Yeah, they call it a yourtgage because it‚Äôs YOURS. Get it? They ask you several times if you understand their remarkably clever mortgage name. 

My last call ended with a dude named Trent saying, ‚ÄúDang bro. Would love to help you buy that place in Arkansas, but our rates are nowhere near as good as what you‚Äôve been offered elsewhere‚Äù. 

Sold my stock the next day."
2021-06-22 18:08:47,wallstreetbets,I have RKT. But just because it‚Äôs a fintech doesn‚Äôt automatically bucket it into a premium class‚Ä¶
2021-06-22 18:03:27,wallstreetbets,"all i hear is buy UWMC

2021-06-22 14:37:08,wallstreetbets,Wtf why do you hate me? I just sold calls and you bring up this bullshit?

2021-06-22 11:19:50,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt understand whether you‚Äôre making the case to buy or sell rocket.
2021-06-22 11:49:10,wallstreetbets,"I don't know, it is time to delete everything that isn't GME, AMC, WISH, or UWMC?"
2021-06-22 13:07:50,wallstreetbets,"This made me laugh out loud.  I personally had a great experience, and most do.  That is why they have 91% retention and have won like 69 JD Power awards"
2021-06-22 14:43:06,wallstreetbets,Shitty customer service is cheap and should help their profit margin.  Bullish.
2021-06-22 15:28:34,wallstreetbets,We refinanced last year and had a similar experience with Rocket so we went elsewhere. Doesn't mean the tech isnt good and that people who don't know enough to shp around wont be lured into the easiest to find option
2021-06-22 13:45:31,wallstreetbets,"i think you mean high margin or maybe low churn.  either way you're missing the point of the post.   or didn't read it, which is more understandable"
2021-06-22 12:39:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm just not into RKT. For me, that ship has sailed."
2021-06-22 11:29:45,wallstreetbets,"I am telling you to DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. I dont mean that rudely. I mean that EVERY analyst is going to say sell because this company steals market from every sector they jump into! They gave been building this tech for a decade and it's working. I'm saying to buy because this stock will be THAT stock that everyone says damn I wish I bought it when it was 20. No one wants to hear the same old RKT IS Amazon of Fintech but it will be. 

Edit. I am true special, I forgot to finish my sentence**  I mean that EVERY analyst is going to say sell because this company steals market from every sector they jump into! ANALysts are either paid to push the selling, or they have ties to RKT and are loading while telling you to sell. 

Edit.2 another poster said awhile back that alot of the independent reviewers all have high buy ratings even on the same websites that have high sells because they are not financially tied to any one organization.

Remindme! 4 years"
2021-06-22 12:11:23,wallstreetbets,GME posts get auto banned (or they were ) AMC has its own sub. So what‚Äôs left is pump and dumps (obviously RKT isn‚Äôt that) but it seems like every quarter RKT posts come out of the woodwork and then disappear
2021-06-22 13:37:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. My experience is probably worth dick. Just figured I would share. Hard to invest in a company when you‚Äôve had a few bad encounters. I‚Äôm guessing they usually get the right state. 

But YOURtgage is objective fucking stupid. Someone got paid to come up with that."
2021-06-22 15:38:24,wallstreetbets,Agree. Just thought I would share my experience. It‚Äôs probably meaningless.
2021-06-22 14:00:30,wallstreetbets,"yes high margin. my bad.

currently rkt cant be valued as fintech.

you cant innovate your way out of gaining  1% on a loan.

at least rkt hasnt showed how.

all the other services are low margin feeding off high client retention."
2021-06-22 13:11:40,wallstreetbets,Do it for the rest of us!
2021-06-22 14:12:18,wallstreetbets,"I understand, been holding for a couple of months.

2021-06-22 12:38:45,wallstreetbets,"Haha, fair point.  But if you look at my profile all I talk about is Rocket all year round"
2021-06-22 13:41:53,wallstreetbets,"Agree, sounds like a medical condition.  ""I was constipated and pushed too hard so now I got a yourtgage"""
2021-06-22 14:25:37,wallstreetbets,"i disagree.  the 1% you reference is gain-on-sale margin (and it is more like 2-3%) but it is not correct to think of that as profit margin.  it is more akin to price for a product --  gain-on-sale % x loan volume = gross revenue.  with more competition and industry capacity, price goes down.  but RKT consistently gets a higher price bc they can go direct-to-consumer and have greater customer loyalty and retention, so they can generate more revenue on less volume than competitors which drives the bottom line.  they can also drop price to squeeze competitors and gain market share which is what they are currently doing.

but when it comes to margins, it is more about operating expenses - how much it costs them to generate that revenue.  better tech via predictive analytics, machine learning, AI, etc. means less human touch and higher EBITDA margins.  this was how they scaled up 4x in 2020 without missing a beat while their competitors were scrambling on how to get bailed out.  this is also how they survived and grew share post-GFC while others blew up.  and that data and technology can be utilized for cross-marketing, promotion, efficiencies of scale that a standalone fintech company cannot do.  they haven't launched those businesses yet but it is imminent.  watch out when they do."

2021-06-22 12:33:41,wallstreetbets,"Shifted my position on CLOV recently. The company adding short squeeze as a probable risk is a pretty clear indicator that they are both aware of the massive shorting, and are not planning on diluting. Some ppl are saying CLOV is 99% short, and honestly, I believe them. Do your own DD, but this might be the first stock to 420.69$ if the information is correct"

2021-06-22 18:31:14,wallstreetbets,"Big position in PLTR myself. Hope you‚Äôre not looking for near term returns. I think the stock is priced right where it is and should go to $27/$28 after they drop a 55% growth number for Q2. 

If you‚Äôre in this for some parabolic move I believe it‚Äôs unlikely. The price earlier this year was too early.

This is an amazing LT play‚Äî it‚Äôs not a squeeze or exponential short term play."

2021-06-22 10:55:43,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs an expensive stock no doubt. But so was every game changing company when they went public. Think Tesla Google Facebook
2021-06-22 12:08:07,wallstreetbets,"Revenue growing like 70% yoy, projected 30% revenue increase yoy for the  
 next 5 years, doesn't seem terrible to me.  The main reason they aren't  
 profitable is because they keep giving stock to employees so they can   
reward employees who've been with the company a long time and offer   
comeptitive packages to the best devs.  The rest goes back into the   
company because they are building a giant."

You need to sell your shit or have your shit used by the people to be as big as Apple , Microsoft , etc. You can say but the companies that people use regularly uses PLTR software but it doesn't mean money , you need sell products directly to the people to make bank.

Also , they don't sell their product to anyone that goes against their ideology like China so they are missing a huge part of revenue. All big companies have to sell their shit in China."
2021-06-22 11:16:00,wallstreetbets,Why do you disagree? They make military hardware don‚Äôt they? Basically brining video game like huds to actual human operators

2021-06-22 15:35:20,wallstreetbets,Hes not gonna answer this
2021-06-22 16:15:17,wallstreetbets,"Your statement is 100% right and I believe they are similar to a Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop. From a software standpoint vs. hardware obviously though. I doubt boeing/lockheed/northrop sell TOO much to China if at all. 

Right now, they don't have a product that they can sell to the normal everyday citizen, that is a fact. However, one interesting point is that they are not one-directional. They can touch every industry that produces data. An interesting point to that is that IBM states that 90% of the worlds data has been produced in the past 2 years...

I'm invested in Palantir and I don't believe OP is correct RIGHT NOW. I think they are a lockheed/boeing/northrop in its infancy stage. However, with much more avenues to touch. :) Who knows what will happen though"
2021-06-22 13:57:52,wallstreetbets,"They started selling to the general public a few months ago and even introduced a free trial model. i didnt put so much money into a company without doing DD, your points are not valid. There are some deficiencies in the company but the one you mentioned is not it."
2021-06-22 12:03:32,wallstreetbets,They don't make hardware haha
2021-06-22 11:28:50,wallstreetbets,That would be Microsoft‚Äôs IVAS system powered by $MVIS.
2021-06-22 11:36:02,wallstreetbets,"I mean, saying they have bad financials isn't exactly detailed analysis either. I'd love to hear your thoughts though"
2021-06-22 13:32:53,wallstreetbets,Thanks! They worked at Google before PLTR so they did fine!! They‚Äôre very talented at their job!
2021-06-22 14:04:16,wallstreetbets,"No , I'm talking about normal people like us , we don't buy PLTR products to use. We buy Apple products , Microsoft products , etc. Also , all of the money you made was from memes lol , you just gambled and won."
2021-06-22 18:41:02,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs talking about Apple and Microsoft being business-to-consumer (B2C) and Palantir being business-to-business (B2B), which is absolutely correct.  Palantir will never sell products to consumers.  His point, which is valid, is that Palantir cannot scale their business to the 2T market cap zone, which is where Apple and Microsoft are.  That being said, Palantir will certainly grow to be bigger than they are today - I think it is just a matter of time.  They won‚Äôt ever be Apple big, but they might be Oracle big at some point."
2021-06-22 13:23:01,wallstreetbets,Ouch. Confused the two. I need to do more research. Truly an autist because I‚Äôm holding PLTR without knowing what the fuck I own
2021-06-22 12:02:46,wallstreetbets,At this point in Googles life they were profiting $5 billion annually. Palantir lost $1 billion last year. To compare them to google as OP is such a fucking joke it's ridiculous. If a company was on the right path they would actually have something to show for it.
2021-06-22 14:57:45,wallstreetbets,"Ahhh yes, glad to have a Lockheed Martin fighter jet in my backyard."
2021-06-22 18:40:41,wallstreetbets,"And would you mind telling me MSFTs percentage of net profit derived from retail consumer sales? Under 10% right? Cool. Thanks.

Edit:

> Microsoft breaks down its sprawling businesses into three main buckets: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The More Personal Computing bucket includes Windows, Surface, Xbox, and search, and it has contributed $13 billion to Microsoft‚Äôs overall $41.7 billion this quarter. That‚Äôs around 31 percent.

Remember though, ""personal computing"" includes Windows and surface which are predominately gobbled up by enterprises.

You don't need to sell direct to consumer. But yes, it helps if EVERYONE needs what you have. In PLTRs case most (maybe not every) business needs what they have, they just don't known it yet and need to figure out where they can profitably scale the private enterprise side of their business to actually generate profits (and stop taking loss making or breakeven government contracts).

Not advocating for PLTR, no position and DGAF, but your argument of needing to sell to every consumer is very BS."
2021-06-22 15:48:34,wallstreetbets,Look at Raytheon. Then stfu
2021-06-22 14:25:15,wallstreetbets,PLTR is a good long hold. But I believe MVIS is as well. So you don‚Äôt have a bad investment. You‚Äôll be fine.
2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I have a super dumb question: NSCC-002 does margin check, daily or hourly? Even if daily, for all HF, &companies shorted &stocks in USA, does SEC have manpower to check margin manually? Or done with computer? If computer, how does a computer not enforce it?? 
Pls forgive me, Ape Andy is a very dumb and stupid ape! So I need help from smart apes! Pls pls

I have a super dumb question again! 

NSCC-002 does margin check, daily or hourly? 

Even if daily, for all HF, &companies shorted &stocks in USA, 

does SEC have manpower to check margin manually? 

Or done with computer? 

If computer, how does a computer not enforce it??

How does a computer turn a blind eye on enforcement?

Hack it?

Pull the plug of the electrical power of the computer?

I mean you have to give the hedge funds shorting good companies to oblivion a break right?  Just like the taxpayers gave big institutions a big break with 2008 financial crisis!"

2021-06-22 12:39:14,wallstreetbets,"I severely urge you to not get your hopes up on this.  I haven't even been paying attention to it, because it's one of those things that everyone is excited about, but in reality it either does nothing, or tips the scales even further somehow. I'm learning to reserve my excitement for actual change, not just the lip service we are constantly bombarded with."
2021-06-22 11:03:50,wallstreetbets,They are already mislabeling shorts as longs so how does this change anything or than getting rid of human element.
2021-06-22 12:20:35,wallstreetbets,"Also does it check to see when the cash out to cover was moved in? I could be totally off, but my understanding is that this rule already had the liquidation clause, it's just that you had a month to move money to show you're covered.  Then you have a month for that money to be wherever it's really needed/doing work. 

It may be harder to move the money each day, but if the penalty is losing billions, somehow I think they'll find a way."

2021-06-22 10:25:58,wallstreetbets,"$CLNE volume has diminished significantly, which tells me that MMs are holding onto their shares with diamond hands in order to drive demand up by drying up supply. This could mean one of two things: 1) they are preparing for a breakout, or 2) they are getting ready to sell. I can't quite figure out which one yet, but I'm studying the charts closely."

2021-06-22 10:33:35,wallstreetbets,"Well, me and my 150+ shares certainly hope so lol. Small bananas, I know, but bananas nonetheless."
2021-06-22 11:06:52,wallstreetbets,"The price is severely overvalued IMHO. The company size and financials don't justify the current price, this is a function of MM manipulation..

A good long term play? Sure, but this stock will sink back down below $5 and then in 5 or so years we can talk again. Just my opinion!"
2021-06-22 12:07:44,wallstreetbets,"They do. Look at the size of the trades happening. Retail investors don't have the kind of capital it would take to move this stock. Candlestick chart should show you the volume ticks, which you can use to sort of see the real volume. Large movements are institutions with the millions to back it up."
2021-06-22 12:05:09,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I think. I've been studying the charts (still am) for the last few months. I believe that the stock is currently bullish, but still in Phase B, so this will be volatile with very little volume as the institutions are holding most of the shares now. They will test the market for demand and supply by dropping the price to see what the lowest price and highest price are, and hopefully shake off a few weak handed retail sellers. This might happen several times before Phase C starts, at which point we're going to see a significant breakout.

Buying in at the start of the breakout would be a wise move, as right now it's still a risk. I can't predict the timeline, unfortunately, but whenever the institutions feel that demand is high enough, we'll see a massive sell-off going into Phase D and E, with retail investors buying in late and, eventually, holding the bag.

So, right now, I'm bullish on this stock and will continue to hold until I see a significant character change in the charts (large volume sale).

2021-06-22 12:17:58,wallstreetbets,High risk high reward if you can get it right. I made 1000 off a hundred 2 weeks ago when clov first took off. I doubled my account value in a week when i started then back to square one the next week with the fed interest meeting. My plug calls expired on Friday and if they would have been for this week I could have made 6k off of 700

If you need a 50% DROP then how have you 'been onboard', this does not even make sense.

Is it just the brand bringing it down as a poor performer in the past 15 years?

I feel if this were a startup they'd easily be valued in the $25-$50G market cap range.

I'm long and not worried, but I'd like to know more about BBbears and headwinds.

2021-06-22 10:44:50,wallstreetbets,"If you want more in depth and consistent DD I would go over to the subreddit dedicated to BB stock. The sentiment over there echos a lot of what comments are here

Bearish in the short term, bullish in the long term. They're making great connections and making strives in however what's one of the biggest things they have an issue with? MAKING MONEY

If you look back, almost every one of their earnings calls or reports has not been profitable save a few times. At the current price, would I buy? Sure but only if I was sitting on a lot of cash. I would more likely buy a biggee load of we get back to $10-11 range. $12 is not bad, but again not where I personally feel the company is valued at yet right now in present day.

2021-06-22 14:54:03,wallstreetbets,"Advances to USA EV & IoT Smart City Infrastructure will be critical. That's why I extended the moon scenario further out. Currently, US is pretty obstinate to combat climate change. If you have to take a road trip in America, all the main highways are geared towards fossil fuel. Not a whole lot of EV charging stations being placed in Podunk Missouri, Ar-Kanas etc. 

I honestly cant put a price target on the IVY car data monetization. Frankly, I believe revenues from this AWS 50/50 venture will be incalculably high.

As far as short term PT, the growth to BB's software and service sales will drive the share price. I am optimistic that Spark and AdHoc will be the drivers in this type of revenue growth."
2021-06-22 13:55:33,wallstreetbets,"true dat but the other shitty startups in my portfolio are growing revenues...well except for $QS but I sold enough of that at $105 to make me not give a fuck about revenue.

I've worked for a lot of turnaround stories and tbh, its probably harder to reinvent and then successfully monetize an existing company then it is to do the startup thing."
2021-06-22 15:01:32,wallstreetbets,"Its always easy to blame banks and hedge funds for your losses, I personally blame the CEO for the fact that this company does not make any money üôÉ"
2021-06-22 10:56:06,wallstreetbets,"Like I said, I am bullish on BB long term.  So, CNN Money 1yr forecast average is $8.75, but the forecast is broad with a high of $20 and a low of $4.50.

As for falling just before/after earnings, just my experience, it may not.  Forecasted earnings are much lower than the previous quarter.  It's been on a downward sideways trend since the peak June 3.  

These are just my thoughts.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SKLZ DD based on a look at the competitors + TA Following the [DD](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o55oy9/sklz_dd_an_interesting_stock_with_massive/) of u/GRAPE_FRUIT_EXTRACT yesterday, i'd like to analyze $SKLZ by looking into the wide range of competitors and counter critics on his post.

For good measure: Skillz is a company active in the mobile gaming sector, using a platform that focuses on online competition against other players. Often the games even include cash rewards. Someone at r/stocks who sees his glass half empty once said ""SKLZ is neither a game company, nor a gambling company"". Well, I see the glass half full: SKLZ combines both gaming and casino. Because it isn't black and white to determine direct competitors, I'll try to look into different sectors.

**Market Cap: 7.6B**

# Mobile gaming sector is competitive, but fragmented

* The mobile gaming sector is a huge industry and isn't gonna disappear anytime soon. You hear stories of programmers developping a game that blows up and making millions off a single app. From programmers chasing their luck with game developing software, to giants like Supercell. The range of mobile games is immense. Can SKLZ compete against the fragmented gaming sector? Yes it can. As in any company you gotta have main products that secure profit. With mobile games this is not that easy. People get bored after a while and will delete the game, but classics are the ones that people keep returning to. This is where SKLZ gets separated from the competitors. Games like Solitaire, Bingo, Domino's,... are those **classic games** at which SKLZ focuses on in their portfolio. Their top 3 most popular apps count for 88% of their revenue. And that is a very important aspect. With this fundament they got something to build on. The same audience must be the target, creating a solid userbase. Maybe there's a decline in popularity for a while, but they'll always come back, even if it's just for a minute.
* The second point, is the business model of SKLZ that makes them very unique in the mobile gaming sector. Profit is being made off a **commission**. A model that is known to be very effective anno 2021 given the amount of people playing. Don't search too far, your own broker uses the same principle. And as we all know 20/21 have been booming times for our brokers, thanks to us degenerates buying plays week in week out. Yes SKLZ is a platform, but the more you use it, the more profit, that's equal for both gaming apps as platforms.
* Thirdly, these **ads** are getting out of hand lately. Even on my national sport site, the ads are almost longer than the clip itself. Every degenerate has a smartphone and every one of them will watch the same ad over and over again just to play the game over and over again. This is another source of income that is an easy plus for game developers.

# NFL Challenge

* Just as Draftkings, SKLZ also got a partnership with the NFL ([source](https://www.skillz.com/nflchallenge/)). American football is the biggest sport in America and seeing the NFL on the Skillz' website boosts their brand image. They actually have a really nice website , feel free to take a look at [https://www.skillz.com](https://www.skillz.com/). It really comes over clean and organized. The NFL challenge gives developers a chance to create a NFL-inspired game. Since June 1st, 2021, the Game Development phase has begun. The website is up to date and I just feel like they're onto something. Really looking forward to that game, even though this is more something for next year.

# Jack Russel on the loose

* Above that both get added to the Russell 3000 ([source](https://www.casino.org/news/draftkings-gnog-among-gaming-equities-joining-russell-3000/)). DKNG's run up got on a hold following a short-selling allegation. In comparison, SKLZ had a more slower recovery and still awaits its a run up, but this addition could help. Introducing it's ticker to a new audience, ETF‚Äôs will be forced to buy in the stock in the upcoming weeks. ETF‚Äôs (The goal of an ETF is to replicate the performance of an index as efficient and accurate as possible) are indeed required to pull in the new stock to match index weighting‚Äôs. So i expect the stock to rise in the coming 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

[In the picture you can see the crucial date of 25 June, after which the effects are expected to settle in.](https://preview.redd.it/awhcin98rt671.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=517a3a7252187214a28846ff7badfa4dd82bd256)

* Funny note: SKLZ and DKNG were taken public by the same SPAC team.

# supported by Numbers

* In the recent two months, 2 ratings have been given by research firms which were buy and hold with a mean price target of $23.5 . Although these price targets don't assure anything, it helps confirming. If we look to the analyst ratings since Jan 2021, the stock got a mean target of $28.75.
* ""Leveraged to the dungeons"": this might go against your principle of leveraged to the tits, but sometimes you gotta get out of your comfort zone. Debt ratio of zero. If SKLZ wants to make new investments in the future, they certainly got room for it.
* ""Cash is king"": SKLZ is sitting on it, and if they don't watch out, they'll have to stand on it very soon. Cash on hand was counted at $613M in the first quarter of 2021 ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SKLZ/skillz/cash-on-hand)).
* *A look at the competition.* If you think about a stock, active in mobile games, trading on the market, a lot of you will think about ZNGA, since it was trending on WSB early February. Just to name one. In the following table we take a look at a few actors in the sector.

&#x200B;

|TICKER|Gross margin (= Gross profit / Net sales)|Asset turnover (= Total revenues / Average total assets)|Debt ratio (= Total liabilities / Total assets)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SKLZ|94.7%|1.4|0|
|BILI|23.7%|0.6|0.4|
|TTWO|54.5%|0.6|0|
|ZNGA|59.8%|0.4|0.2|

# Bullish side note

* Their Chief Technology Officer was mentioned in the second annual list of LGBTQ women and nonbinary innovators in business and tech by Fast Company. Read the article [here](https://www.fastcompany.com/queer-50/2021?cid=eem524:524:s00:06/06/2021_fc&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=Compass&utm_campaign=eem524:524:s00:06/06/2021_fc).

# Bear case

* A lawsuit is currently running against SKLZ. An investigation is being held on behalf of investors who purchased between October 26, 2019 and April 30, 2021. This is because it is claimed that the company has misled their investors. More specifically because the popularity of their main 3 games, which account for 88% of their revenue has declined. But as i mentioned in the second paragraph. A game like Solitaire is like rats, you can kill them, try to trap them as much as you want. They‚Äôll always come back.
* *A look at the competition.* What must not be forgotten is that SKLZ merged with a SPAC. And these SPAC's got focused by the SEC, restrictions were hanging above their head as a sword of Damocles. Post-SPAC's in general have been slapped in the market since February. The stock has dropped over 50% in the market from a ATH of $42.73 . A correction has pulled the price down a lot. As Post-SPAC's were oversold, they seem to have recovered from their pull back and try to settle in. This also counts for SKLZ. One must look at the future. Most recent update ([news](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/class-action-ebs-sklz-spce-094000886.html)) announced that the lawsuit actions have commenced. The news was well received on the market as the stock was up on the day (6/20). This convinces me the lawsuit has already ( or at least partly) been priced in.

# Technical Analysis

* The stock has reached a double dip in mid April/mid May , but ever since has picked up it's upward trend. Upward momentum has just built up with the latest price still trading higher than the price at the end of may, finding a new support level (explained in the next paragraph).

&#x200B;

[Upward trend](https://preview.redd.it/ehte66k9rt671.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=8acfb149781b07a9939894649d8db5a815498b2d)

* I already see you thinking, wtf are those red candles lately, well they got support from a bad boy: The Inverted Hammer, yes, this hammer appears during a downtrend with a long upper shadow and a small real body at the lower end of the range reflecting an evening between buyers and sellers as the bears start shitting their pants. So i think the price may have reached a bottom and is ready to turn higher.

&#x200B;

[Inverted Hammer](https://preview.redd.it/1pbqizkart671.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=124c3a66f970bc211a27d60f3ec0417323025225)

**TL:DR**

* Read the headings and words in bold.
* I‚Äôd like to thank you for reading. Not at all am i saying SKLZ is gonna follow their competitor's trends. It's just small indicators that support my thesis of a run up. This is no financial advice, i‚Äôm only giving my personal view on the road of SKLZ.

position: 230 shares @$18.56 in combo with 6/25 calls (strike 20) and 7/16 calls (strike 21)."

The company said they were trying to cheat on the platform. But either way, I don't see any major consequences for the stock."
2021-06-22 11:17:08,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on that- hope it‚Äôs good.
2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ReconAfrica DD ‚Äì Early stages of what is setting up to be the largest oil discovery in decades This is a DD for a company, Reconnaissance Energy Africa (RECAF) I have been following since mid-January. I haven‚Äôt seen it discussed on this sub because it‚Äôs market cap is only 1.54 Billion USD.

There is A LOT of DD on this company out there that takes weeks to really go through. I‚Äôm not going to even try to cover it all, but basically ReconAfrica is an oil exploration company that recently discovered and has 90% rights to the largest undeveloped onshore basin in the world right now, the Kavango Basin, with total petroleum generating potential that‚Äôs north of 120 billion barrels of oil. Given it‚Äôs current market cap, I believe ReconAfrica is one of the most undervalued stocks in the market, a potential future 100+ bagger.

**Some history on the ReconAfrica**: the company was taken public about two years ago. Back then, all it really had was an aeromagnetic survey showing what the company interpreted to be extremely deep sedimentary basin in the countries of Namibia and Botswana. On the basis of this survey, they had the foresight to purchase drilling rights to over 8 million acres of land for very cheap. Last year Recon purchased a drilling rig and shipped it to Namibia to get more detailed stratigraphic data. The company commended drilling the first well in January/February and are currently midway through the second well.

The preliminary results have been very bullish. I am not a geologist but as I understand it, an active petroleum system needs to have a source rock, a seal, and reservoir, and traps in order to be viable. With the data released in the past two months being even better than expected, it looks like all of those components are present and there is potential for huge amounts of extractable oil. A full suite of results from the core samples in the first two wells is expected to be released soon. In future wells, they plan to target an actual oil trap using the seismic data. By the end of 2021, they hope to be entering discussion with Joint Venture partners.

Geologically speaking, the Kavango basin is similar to the Permian Basin in Texas (which has over 50 billion barrels of oil and is currently producing 5 million barrels of oil per day). However, the Permian acreage is Texas is divided among dozens of companies. The largest of them Diamondback (FANG), Pioneer (PXD), Concho (CXO), and EOG all have market caps in the tens of billions of dollars. In contrast, ReconAfrica has the rights to the entire basin all to themselves. That is what makes it an incredible opportunity in my opinion.

I think the company (currently trading in the $9-$10 range) could be a $100-$200 stock by next year once the exploratory drilling and seismic program is completed and the company enters Joint Venture (JV discussions). Long term, I can see the company being a next oil supermajor. Again, for one company to own the drilling rights to an entire basin like is extremely unique.

Another bullish tailwind for Reconnaissance is that Western supermajors have been cutting oil exploration expenditure due to environmental pressure from environmentalists and the EIA. However, demand isn‚Äôt going to significantly decline for decades and we could be in for a [major oil supply crunch](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudi-Arabia-And-Russia-Warn-Of-Major-Oil-Supply-Crunch.html). The company is in the perfect position to capitalize on a good macroeconomic environment for oil and gas

**The bear case:** Some of the biggest risks are

* Extreme opposition from foreign activist groups who want to stop ReconAfrica and Namibia from developing in the Kavango. They‚Äôve spread rumors and misinformation on social media, published hit pieces in newspapers, organized marches, etc. If they are successful at slowing down or stopping ReconAfrica that would obviously be bad for the company. But I don‚Äôt believe their criticism is justified. If ReconAfrica is successful, you can bet that it will hugely benefit Namibia and Botswana which in turn will be massively beneficial for the people and wildlife. There will be more money to raise people out of poverty, increase access to healthcare and education, support conservation areas, etc. So far, ReconAfrica and the governments have been committed to protecting wildlife, the livelihoods of local people, following international best standards, and promoting economic development.
* ReconAfrica has no *proven* reserves yet. We are waiting on more data from additional stratigraphic wells and seismic activities before the company can formally declare it has oil and gas reserves, meaning we still aren‚Äôt 100% derisked yet. However, given that we now have two exploration wells with thick marine source rock, carbonates, and a rift basin full of convention traps the play has been significantly derisked.
* Governmental risk. Of course it is ultimately up to the government and people of Namibia and Botswana to decide how they want to develop their natural resources. However, [Mines and Energy Minister Tom Alweendo](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/03/africa/namibia-oil-exploration-intl-cmd/index.html) and [Kavango East Government Bonifasius Wakudumo](https://www.namibian.com.na/102332/read/Oil-driller-announces-petroleum-system-at-second-well) are both excited and supportive of ReconAfrica‚Äôs activities in the Kavango Basin. And just last week, ReconAfrica and NAMCOR (Namibia‚Äôs national oil company) [signed a partnership to work together on exploring and developing the Kavango basin](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Press-Release-061421.pdf).

**Disclosure:** I am long RECO with shares I bought in January. Oil exploration is a high risk/high reward game, so don‚Äôt take this as financial advise to buy shares. Do your own DD and come to your own conclusions.

Crazy to finally see RECAF in WSB. Shout out to the guy from pennystocks that had a great DD several months ago, thanks buddy."
2021-06-22 14:34:35,wallstreetbets,"In on this since January - about 2800 shares purchased between $2.29 and $7.80 - average around $5.50.  Learned about it from my pops who has a much bigger stake at a much lower buy in, lol.

This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, if what they think is down there is really down there.  It would be the potentially last gigantic onshore conventional oil find (no fracking!)  And their recent moves - digging water wells for the local villages and donating $1M to the Namibian COVID vaccine effort - is telling me that they are building relationships with the local people because they're in it for the long haul.

Consider this - their original plan was to not release any information until all three test bores and the 2D seismic was complete (Q4 2021) - but that was blown up when their partners in the Namibian government got a \*little\* excited during an interview and let it slip that they found oil and gas shows in the first bore.

Since then it has been a firehose of information, from the first borehole showing 50% more source rock thickness than originally estimated, to the second borehole showing oil and gas in the first third of the bore.

That first well was just supposed to be an exploration well, but it was just revealed that it was capped in a way that they could potentially come back and test for oil production.

More information is likely coming in the first week of July - including potentially lab results from the first borehole, and initial results from the second, as well as preliminary 2D seismic results.  This week may be the last time to get in sub $10 (if it ever goes back there... just checked, it's at $10.49).

Another potential investment opportunity would be RNSFF - which will be merging with RECAF likely Q3 2021.  Every share of RNSFF gets you 0.046 shares of RECAF, which means it's been trading at a 3-5% discount recently.

Good luck to all!   (Not financial advice, do your own DD)"

2021-06-22 10:58:56,wallstreetbets,"Avg price of 3.90 CAD here, been in this baby since last year."
2021-06-22 14:46:10,wallstreetbets,This is a once in a generation type play IMO. This is currently a 2.1b company that could very easily reach 50b+ market cap.
2021-06-22 16:26:57,wallstreetbets,"This thing is up to 12.50 CAD already? holy hell. I remember looking at it in April at 3 bucks, didn't pull the trigger and watched it jump to 7. Said ""Nah, im not touching that"". 

Heart = pierced"
2021-06-22 17:10:23,wallstreetbets,"I have accumulated 55,000 shares of RECAF steadily since January 2021 with an average price of $6.00 USD. My strategy was enter early and accumulate more as the project de-risks. My latest buy was today at $10.25 USD. I've done hundreds of hours of DD with friends old and new and based on the drilling program's success so far and the body language displayed by our highly-regarded (legendary) management team, it appears **we are well on our way to becoming one of the most, if not THE MOST, valuable junior O&G explorer in history.**

**To new investors:** you will see wild price targets of $500 or $1,000 or more being thrown around on other subs and although there is a scenario where this could happen (30 billion barrels of recoverable oil could do the trick), we don't need to get to $500 for this to be a phenomenal, once-in-a-lifetime investment. At a modest discovery of just 5 billion barrels we could easily see 10-15x based on the comps and early analyst research. Things are about to go from good to great as we learn more about what‚Äôs exactly in the ground. I‚Äôm just an average ape so don't take this as financial advice but I have done my DD and recommend you do yours."
2021-06-22 12:41:22,wallstreetbets,I ever told you $RECAF Black Gold! Hell yes
2021-06-22 14:52:10,wallstreetbets,Just to add that this Canadian Company is on the venture as well (RECO.V) for all those Canadian TFSA's as that is where I'm holding it!

2021-06-22 10:27:22,wallstreetbets,5 bagger for you already? Nice!
2021-06-22 14:51:22,wallstreetbets,"Hello wallstreetbets. I think i know what you want to hear about a stock:

ReconAfrica has the largest declared short position of all TSXV companies."
2021-06-22 12:28:04,wallstreetbets,Up 6% today‚Ä¶
2021-06-22 13:04:02,wallstreetbets,"Holding just a few Positions, but still: is there oil on the moon?"
2021-06-22 18:02:57,wallstreetbets,"From my understanding the first hole they drilled was actually site listed as 6-2. The rumor of good composition of oil being found down to 800 ft; Would make it 120 ft further down the initially expected (high estimates placed it at 680).  Still bullish but not 50%.   It would only be 50% growth if the first drill site was 6-1.  After completion of 6-2 they did order additional testing equipment for that site in regards to natural gas as well as methods to test different drilling methods.


Could be wrong, long 600 shares at 2$ average."
2021-06-22 11:01:00,wallstreetbets,Would have jumped in if options were available :(
2021-06-22 10:46:29,wallstreetbets,"Damn is this a otc stock, cause I was going to start doing more dd and possibly start building a position in reconnaissance Africa but I dont want to open a new account on another exchange platform"
2021-06-22 10:49:05,wallstreetbets,No options :/
2021-06-22 10:20:24,wallstreetbets,"honestly, these guys are going to ruin that area and cause untold amounts of CO2 to be released further accelerating climate change. i get this sub is about making money, but investing in (and helping) the O&G industry will ultimately destroy the economy as we know it. never mind the risks posed by govt intervention and the fact that this is a dying industry. not for me - and god i hope this company fails. not rooting against you, just moreso rooting for the survival of life as we know it"
2021-06-22 14:49:39,wallstreetbets,Bruh this stock was 12years valued at 0.2-2$ per share now its risen 1700% in 1 year and who boigh a tad earlier is around 5500% yeah another one of those hedge fund traps to sell their shares at highest value possible. What the fuck happened to wsb man
2021-06-22 10:13:54,wallstreetbets,Fuck oil stocks
2021-06-22 10:38:39,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in for 1275 shares.  Holding until at least 2030
2021-06-22 15:19:20,wallstreetbets,Actually the short interest is 63% as of this week. RECAF even made a statement about it
2021-06-22 15:31:41,wallstreetbets,"Thats just the short volume, not the amount that is shorted. High short volume on any given day would be 60%+"
2021-06-22 15:08:44,wallstreetbets,Seems like it. Been slowly buying since April and have a few others on board as well.
2021-06-22 17:13:49,wallstreetbets,It's not too late
2021-06-22 17:27:44,wallstreetbets,Yup.  That's right around $1M USD.  That's a not-insignificant chunk of their current working capital.  I don't think they would do this donation if they didn't plan on being there for the long haul.  Also check out the water wells they're digging.
2021-06-22 10:30:05,wallstreetbets,From his [posts](https://www.markovchained.com/assets/view/RECAF?position_id=4331) alone he's up 313% since first post
2021-06-22 15:38:22,wallstreetbets,Why not shares?

2021-06-22 16:25:42,wallstreetbets,You are not very smart if you don‚Äôt buy shares
2021-06-22 11:00:36,wallstreetbets,"It trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  Robinhood won‚Äôt support it, but I‚Äôve purchased shares through Schwab.  I‚Äôd assume most major brokerages can trade it no problem."
2021-06-22 16:55:12,wallstreetbets,"Can trade on fidelity, no fees."
2021-06-22 15:39:00,wallstreetbets,So? You dont need options on a 100bagger
2021-06-22 10:35:50,wallstreetbets,"I agree we need to phase out oil. But that's going to happen over a period of multiple decades and the way I look at it, there's no reason why a country like Namibia shouldn't be allowed to use their natural resources.

If you want leave the oil in the ground, well then Western countries that have already industrialized and have been emitting greenhouse gasses all throughout the 20th century had better pay Namibia to do so.

If you live in the US like me, keep in mind  we pump 10 million barrels/day out of the ground and that's not changing for the foreseeable future. It's hypocritical to tell a country in Africa that they can't do the same."
2021-06-22 14:36:37,wallstreetbets,And I thought I was the retarded one
2021-06-22 10:30:52,wallstreetbets,Do some actual research before forming such a lazy opinion. The world needs oil. The arrogance of developed countries trying to limit developing companies from profiting off their natural resources is such a joke‚Ä¶like Leonardo DiCaprio flying in his private jet all over the world.
2021-06-22 18:52:05,wallstreetbets,Guess you want significant numbers of people in Africa to keep burning animal shit for heat instead of actual fuels
2021-06-22 10:36:42,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs your AC set on?
2021-06-22 10:26:10,wallstreetbets,It is a dying industry but it won‚Äôt die anytime soon. That being said I wouldn‚Äôt invest in new oil reserves for a high risk/high reward outcome - uranium seems more interesting.
2021-06-22 14:55:57,wallstreetbets,"All you need to do is spend 30 mins reading about the history of the company to understand the restructuring‚Ä¶.

2021-06-22 15:00:46,wallstreetbets,They took over another company to acquire their equipment so the google stock history on it goes back and includes that company. I was worried about the same when I got into the stock in Jan
2021-06-22 15:39:29,wallstreetbets,Are you dumb?
2021-06-22 15:46:31,wallstreetbets,"Lol what a clown, you have no idea about this company or what this play is about."
2021-06-22 14:54:16,wallstreetbets,its a relative new company. they did a reverse takeover not even 2 years ago.
2021-06-22 15:55:59,wallstreetbets,Bruh... i bought in at 50 k shares at 1.77 last September when they were at ground zero with the rigs. It has done a tad better than WISH even with the shorts.
2021-06-22 10:27:51,wallstreetbets,Your Patagonia fleece is made with petroleum products.
2021-06-22 15:03:22,wallstreetbets,Lol. My bank account disagrees bro.
2021-06-22 16:53:29,wallstreetbets,I bought it on TD.  WeBul does not support it.
2021-06-22 10:38:59,wallstreetbets,appreciate the reasonable comment and generally agree. the costs of renewables are trending down quickly and solar is at or cheaper than fossil fuels for developing countries to use now. but agree on the equity discussion. also - climate change will not be equitable and will affect countries in africa more than where i live in the near term.
2021-06-22 14:37:00,wallstreetbets,you are my friend
2021-06-22 10:32:18,wallstreetbets,"okay. not sure what leonardo decaprio has to do with this? also, i‚Äôve done plenty of research. do you not believe in the science of climate change?"
2021-06-22 10:40:17,wallstreetbets,"why? it‚Äôs not - i have my windows open. weird comment. why what‚Äôs yours?

also - moved to geothermal off of gas on a $0 loan‚Ä¶so that was pretty cool"
2021-06-22 10:32:33,wallstreetbets,Nuclear Ape.
2021-06-22 10:31:15,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but I only had to buy it once and I‚Äôve had the same one from a thrift shop for 15 years. max hippie bullshit! 

I know we need oil, I just think reducing demand for it is an admirable goal. Probably wrong sub for this though"
2021-06-22 12:40:13,wallstreetbets,"You definitely can‚Äôt assume just because a technology is labeled renewable nawabs it doesn‚Äôt use oil anyway. There‚Äôs a actually a documentary (by Michael Moore surprisingly) on YouTube that shows how most ‚Äúrenewables‚Äù are actually only single digit improvements of oil usage/carbon reduction than just burning the oil/natural gas itself. Mostly due to the fact that the products like solar panels use materials like metals and PV that have to be used structurally or to worm period by having said materials created in ultra hot furnaces which can only be heated with currently technology by, you guessed it, fossil fuels. Steel production itself accounts for about 10% or more of all worldwide emissions and let me leave my crystal ball in the cabinet when I tell you we aren‚Äôt going to stop using steel or produced metals until our consciences move past the need for our physical bodies.
TLDR: not investing in oil won‚Äôt stop its use, but investing in oil will make you solid gains."
2021-06-22 14:41:27,wallstreetbets,I'm not the one who believes that investing in oil & gas will destroy the economy
2021-06-22 10:43:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I got super scared about acid rain too."
2021-06-22 12:13:27,wallstreetbets,"not yet, but i‚Äôm considering it"
2021-06-22 14:12:00,wallstreetbets,"Look, I don't disagree with you entirely.  The silliest thing we can do with oil is burn it - it has so many more uses that don't contribute to climate change.  

HOWEVER, undeveloped nations are likely decades away from being oil-free, and it's extremely arrogant of us to be sitting in our air conditioned houses being powered by solar panels telling people in poverty that no, they cannot use their natural resources to pull themselves into the developed world, despite the fact that we've used coal and oil and gas for the last 150 years to do the same.  

Add to that the fact that RECO just donated $1M to the Namibian vaccine effort, are digging 20+ water wells for the local villages, and have already committed to avoid any drilling that would adversely affect any national park or world heritage site, and you've got an investment that is pretty rare in the O&G industry - one that seems to truly care about the local people and the environment."
2021-06-22 14:42:04,wallstreetbets,i said climate change would fucknuts
2021-06-22 11:04:38,wallstreetbets,"There is a progression of energy use depending on the scale of development in country. For example, all us westerners can bash on oil because we already had it for over a hundred years to build our primary infrastructures. We can afford to search for greener alternatives because we already sleep on beds and sit on toilets. 

Tell an African or a South American family living in a mud hut that they can‚Äôt use the one energy source to propel them into the 21st century and see what they think. Majority of the world still doesn‚Äôt even have access to the hygiene resources that a homeless man in NYC has. Oil discovery is their best chance."
2021-06-22 14:35:22,wallstreetbets,"I think this is the right take. And if they do a good job of including the locals and the local govt then maybe it goes great, but oil doesn‚Äôt have the best track record of responsible land stewardship. 

Are there ways for investors to advocate for more care given to environmental and social impact?"

2021-06-22 10:12:23,wallstreetbets,"As a company with a higher net worth than gamestop, how could it not go higher? It is an undervalued stock, especially if adam takes the money he got from selling shares and renovates theaters."
2021-06-22 10:14:42,wallstreetbets,You have to stop looking at price. Gme = 15b market cap. AMC = 30b market cap.
2021-06-22 10:18:02,wallstreetbets,"That being said, gamestop is overvalued in comparison. a dieing company with a 15b market cap? Reddit is the only reason gamestop reached what it did, gamestop shouldn't even be valued over 20/share. AMC on the other hand is the  largest global theater chain. How could its value not increase? they have over 900 theater locations with well over 25,000 screens, covid was one of the only reason amcs business dropped off."
2021-06-22 11:25:06,wallstreetbets,"AMC def better fundimentally if we are digging through a pile of garbage and picking out whats the better piece of dog shit might be, than Yes AMC it is.

2021-06-22 11:05:56,wallstreetbets,"Do yourself a favor brother and transfer the WS holdings to QT. It does take a long time (about 2.5 weeks for me) but at no point will they be locked in during the transfer. You can always sell on WS even after you request the transfer. You probably already know this part but that way, when you sell down the road, you won't incur another 1.5% FX fee from WS."

2021-06-22 18:33:41,wallstreetbets,good way to delay retirement a couple years
2021-06-22 14:10:44,wallstreetbets,"If it was gonna ""jump"" it would have jumped and skyrocketed right around when it first got on the news and then the rich guys would have pulled their money out right aft-------wait a second, maybe they did pull their money out and profit.

Someone has to tell the retards their money is on fire and throwing more of it is just a ridiculous risk but it can keep you warm."

2021-06-22 19:49:39,wallstreetbets,"QT is pathetic for options. Use IBKR. Much nicer interface, smoother and least commission."
2021-06-22 17:09:16,wallstreetbets,I take it you have maxed out your TFSA? Are you not capable of moving TFSA money from cash to a TFSA to trade?

2021-06-22 14:30:15,wallstreetbets,It's done. Already squeezed. All the equity offerings have diluted it even further. Any competent hedge fund admitted defeat on the run up to 360 and reopened their short position there. Retail keeps propping it up but there won't be another squeeze. People need to move on.
2021-06-22 17:22:45,wallstreetbets,Seems like he lost patience.
2021-06-22 15:58:09,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-06-22 17:05:36,wallstreetbets,Same. Sometimes I can sit on it for a day or two at most.
2021-06-22 15:59:07,wallstreetbets,Hmmm. Perhaps they changed it. I did my transfer in Oct 2020.
2021-06-22 14:06:16,wallstreetbets,Brother calling gme a retarded play at this point is willful ignorance

2021-06-22 15:59:10,wallstreetbets,Except there's zero value in gme. You'll be a bagholder and nothing more.
2021-06-22 18:20:04,wallstreetbets,"I'm confused, what's more risky about how he's buying the shares than other ways?"
2021-06-22 14:16:13,wallstreetbets,"God bless you brother, the ambiguous usage of retard around here never fails to throw me off lmao"
2021-06-22 16:01:18,wallstreetbets,Yeah I guess all those Amazon board members who just joined are idiots then and see no value in the company
2021-06-22 16:03:39,wallstreetbets,May you find peace
2021-06-22 18:45:04,wallstreetbets,"WS is a canadian stock broker that charges $0 on commission but make their profits on ppl buying/selling US stocks. You cant hold USD on Wealthsimple and you lose a lot of money if you buy, sell alot of US securities using your Canadian funds (they apply a 1.5% exchange rate fee from CAD -> USD buying and USD -> CAD selling)"

2021-06-22 16:17:12,wallstreetbets,It means you have an extra chromosome because you would have to be dumb as shit to eat delicious crayons.
2021-06-22 16:44:56,wallstreetbets,I think I‚Äôm comfortable betting on the team of new hires and what they must see in the company before I‚Äôd take your word for it bud. Lotta great horses on this new team and I think despite the current valuation it‚Äôd be more foolish to bet against them than anything.

Take a random stock you like.

How much would it cost you to buy 5 calls?

Financial advice, dont trade options until you have almost no questions left."
2021-06-22 12:21:42,wallstreetbets,Because I bought a contract last week and sold it for a 105% gain while Wish moved 20%
2021-06-22 10:53:10,wallstreetbets,"Leverage. You get more gains if it bumps up (and also losses if it drops or doesn't pass your strike price by expiration).  If you want to see 10 baggers or higher, calls are the way. High risk, high reward...way more fun"

2021-06-22 14:17:33,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve become a big fan of put options.  For example, when CLOV was at $28 I bought some put options at around $18. Why?  Because $28 for CLOV is laughably, absurdly high.  Just insane.  Pretty much as close to a guarantee as you are ever going to get that the price will drop considerably in the next week or two if not much sooner.  

Sure enough, the stock price fell hard and my PUT option was well in the money, made like $400 by selling it.  I would have bought more but I didn‚Äôt have the buying power. 

I never buy options with the intention of exercising them. 

PUT options can be your best friend when WSB blows up a stock and there isn‚Äôt an AMC or GME type of following behind it. Short attention spans on other stocks result in a faster drop in price."
2021-06-22 10:53:12,wallstreetbets,"In my understanding we buy them because you can make more profit off them, look up the greeks for options. Also it's like getting the gains off 100 shares of a stock for the price of one contract, for calls anyway.

2021-06-22 13:40:58,wallstreetbets,They are called OTM or out of the money. They cost less but the probability of striking is less. You are also paying for time fade which is a premium being paid to the seller of the Call. The price also varies depending on the expiration period. The more days to execution the better the chances of striking the call price therefore it‚Äôs gonna cost more! The guy who bought 20$ calls didn‚Äôt specify his expiration date but is probably going to be worthless.

2021-06-22 12:00:22,wallstreetbets,">Is this sub now just illiterate people posting fucking options questions? 

What? Hell no! Its also a breeding ground for pump and dumps like this shit here. Or that health stock. I mean, look at OPs History. 4 Months ago he had one post offering help with tutoring and writing essays for people. Than 3 months nothing.  And 1 month ago he has 200K to invest. I don't know a lot of people that can invest 200K and also write homework of students for money. Possible? Yes. Probable? I don't think so."

2021-06-22 19:33:11,wallstreetbets,Never I will
2021-06-22 19:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Nope unless you want to hold the underlying asset it‚Äôs usually rare to exercise a contract as the whole beauty of options trading is that you don‚Äôt need the capital to capitalise on your gain. 

Options are a type of derivative contract - their value is derived from an underlying asset so the contract will move in equal step with the underlying instruments price (the Greeks have some affect in this though)"
2021-06-22 11:04:13,wallstreetbets,"You don't need to be certain about the outcome exactly, you need to be certain about the direction of the stock (up/down) and loosely correct of the result (strike price).

For example: The SPY is currently 421.82. I think it'll finish above 422 before end of June 25th. A 422 call is only $170. But to buy one share of SPY it would cost $422, so options in this case are cheaper with a larger possible gain (if spy closes at like 425 instead of 422)."
2021-06-22 13:13:30,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Maybe we should limit DD's to higher karma accounts with at least 6 months of history on this sub. Something to combat the rising tide of bullshit.

I don't mind short term plays. But 90 percent of the sub is P&Ds when it comes to stock mentions."

2021-06-22 11:58:02,wallstreetbets,What happens if it finishes at 419?
2021-06-22 13:03:00,wallstreetbets,Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant. It‚Äôs for when you‚Äôre certain you‚Äôll make at least some profit.
2021-06-22 19:03:25,wallstreetbets,"But if it finishes at 422, didn‚Äôt you spend $170 for nothing? The total cost of the call has to be less than you made from it in order to turn a profit, right? Like if you have $10 on a 50 call for a stock, it has to be over $60 at expiration for you to have profited? Sorry, I‚Äôm a noob"
2021-06-22 19:47:25,wallstreetbets,Does Robinhood charge for calls like that?
2021-06-22 12:46:49,wallstreetbets,"You should name yourself after that or something bro.

VerifiedUclaTutors"
2021-06-22 11:59:46,wallstreetbets,Then you lose the entire principal of the call ($170 in my example). It's essentially a bet that it will finish at or above the strike.
2021-06-22 19:10:48,wallstreetbets,"The math works like this. The strike price $422 PLUS the premium price $1.70 ($170 divided by 100) is called the break even price. So technically ANYTHING $423.70 or less is a waste. It sounds super shitty right?

BUT if it finished at $424.70 (one dollar above break even) the option would be worth about $270.

You don‚Äôt need to hold the option to expiration, I personally never do. You could sell it during an upward trend and it could be worth significantly more than your initial investment."
2021-06-22 12:51:55,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.  With this information, I got forth retardedly into unknown territory to seek riches."
2021-06-22 14:12:15,wallstreetbets,"so when it does hit 422 by the end of June 25, what happens to your initial bet of 170?"
2021-06-22 17:33:42,wallstreetbets,"You WILL have contracts expire worthless. It‚Äôs kind of depressing. Always have an exit strategy.

Nobody knows when the right time to sell a contract is, but my rule of thumb is buy contacts about a month out and sell if they get to 2-3x profit.

Take a dip into the options world and get your feet wet. A decent idea is to mimic a smarter investors calls and see how they play out. Start with a couple different calls at 1 contract each and monitor them.

Best of luck retard

Also‚Ä¶ you need to apply for options through your broker. They will ask you how much experience you have, select the highest experience level possible. Anything lower than that will limit what you can do, and some brokerage companies won‚Äôt let you change your ‚Äúexperience‚Äù level for 90 days.

This is not financial advice. Just trying to save you a few crying sessions"
2021-06-22 18:43:18,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre now required to post your loss porn on your first option contract that was way OTM because you thought that .10c were a good idea on a sideways moving pump and dump.
2021-06-22 14:17:52,wallstreetbets,"If it's exactly 422 by end of June 25, that's actually a little bad and the option is essentially worthless, because it's the EXACT price. But if it were 423, or 424 at that time the option would be worth $200-300.

But if you bought one share when the price at 421, and it went to 424, you'd be risking $421 and only be up $3.

Options are high risk, high reward."
2021-06-22 17:31:19,wallstreetbets,You have the right to buy 100 shares at $422 per share even if spy is 425. You lose the premium if you exercise. That‚Äôs why when you open calls it tells you your break even price. Which is 423.70 at expiration
2021-06-22 18:02:25,wallstreetbets,"I should‚Äôve set the highest experience possible as it‚Äôs locked futures and options trading for me, so instead I just bought 100 shares in wish at 13.50. Im a bit late to this stock, but hopefully I‚Äôll see highly profitable returns!"

$OCGN popped. Not sure why $OCGN isn't as hot in WSB - unlike $WISH, this is has very solid technicals.

If this technical analysis holds true, we could easily be seeing 39% gains, potentially 92%. On a low estimate, signs pointing to $10.95. Zero Lag MACD is looking good, as well as 30/30 Wave Trend. All signs are positive. Earnings only look bad due to estimates close to 0 (leads to higher red %).

For apes: get in quick while you can. Buying higher than $10.95 is risky.

For autists: Get in before RSI is too high. There will likely be a short term pushback \~ 68 RSI based on trends, hopefully not.

EDIT: I am a truly retarded ape and the image was not uploaded earlier. Here are my crayon drawings. Made yesterday, still holding strong.

My position:  150 shares LONG @$6.62"

&#x200B;

Yesteday's volume was around 400.000 contracts. Over a 1/4 remained bought (who is selling OTM spreads with this action? No one). That could explain yesterday's afternoon trading where volume receeded:

&#x200B;

Volume decreased yesterday, RSI decreased as well but price didn't. Know we have over 1/4 of the call contracts traded yesterday still open.

&#x200B;

The fight is on!

&#x200B;

Still holding on to my calls, looking how volume evolves in the first 30min and 60min of trading.

For now, seems encouraging:

Stay tuned for more updates

&#x200B;

EDIT 1:

&#x200B;

30min of trading; 2x the average share volume and around 100.000 calls traded (almost the whole open interest). Price dropping \~2% right now as it approached the anchored VWAP from yesterday's rise. Pivot moment in the day!

Still much more interest in OTM calls then ITM. $14C and $15C with heavy volume. Total calls volume traded over 120.000 now

I went over why Wish was a great play and this week has been off to a great start.  One of the biggest things I have seen against them here is ""they sell cheap crap"".  It's as if people forget that in todays consumer market, cheap crap is king.  People love cheap crap and many consumers are use to the disposable market we have today.  You don't fix things when they break, you throw them away and buy a new one.  And because of this, people want to spend as little as they can on it as they are conditioned to think it won't last very long and will end up in the trash.

&#x200B;

This is backed up with Wish's quickly growing user base shown by over  over 100 million monthly users on its platform and the recent deal with Petrashop. I remain confident it is a solid investment but don't get your hopes up that it's going to ""moon"" this week or next week.  I expect a lot of ups and downs with steep drops mid week and near end week as shorters looks to make quick gains as well.  And they do make their money, I am sure by this point they figured out the new game and how to squeeze out money on the hyped up stocks.

2021-06-22 10:21:02,wallstreetbets,"They dont sell cheap stuff, they sell shit crap that is usually broken when delivered, not what you expected, or a counterfeit product.

USA started to muscle up about bulk orders of counterfeit stuff from China, and Europe just went personal: starting in july Europe will subject ALL imports, even the cheap ones, to custom duties with a fixed 8‚Ç¨ fee + VAT.

That is going to put a dent in chinese crap shit sellers."
2021-06-22 10:45:33,wallstreetbets,"They don't sell ""cheap crap"" they sell ""counterfeit cheap crap"".  Obviously counterfeit cheap crap."
2021-06-22 13:12:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but they also have legitimate stuff.  Wish does not."
2021-06-22 10:00:10,wallstreetbets,I bought rip-off shit unknowingly from Amazon and was the fuck is fap? I asked for a GAP-tshirt

2021-06-22 14:29:53,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you which is why I didn‚Äôt get in before 10... but looking deeper into financials they have great numbers
Rapid sales/profit growth, new vendors, new shipping system incoming, absurd volume and crazy following on social media.
I would never order their products but apparently the rest of the world does. Undervalued at current prices"
2021-06-22 11:41:32,wallstreetbets,Not saying your a bot but I am saying I've seen this exact comment verbatim on another wish post
2021-06-22 11:03:08,wallstreetbets,Why are you taking the time to go through everyone's comment history in the subreddit and commenting stuff like this? This is the 3rd time I've seen it today

2021-06-22 11:03:10,wallstreetbets,"I searched for this and nowhere does it say anyone will be charged a "" a fixed 8‚Ç¨ fee + VAT.""  

&#x200B;

What they ARE doing is removing the VAT exemption for good under a set price threshold so cheaper goods will have VAT added where in the past it was not.  There is no fixed 8‚Ç¨ fee on anything, just VAT."
2021-06-22 14:15:24,wallstreetbets,Fake news. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs happened. But that‚Äôs probably why the added 300k vendors
2021-06-22 14:18:25,wallstreetbets,Why do you think they added 400k new vendors! They are just getting started
2021-06-22 13:13:53,wallstreetbets,Smh! You do know that they have authorized dealers on their site right ?
2021-06-22 12:50:24,wallstreetbets,I have no idea what I am doing

2021-06-22 13:56:41,wallstreetbets,The number of people watching Wish is growing so fast every day. Many new watchers are going to think wish is just another meme stock when in reality it stands apart on fundamentals. I‚Äôll be sure to keep on posting bullish fundamental points so new watchers can know it‚Äôs not a company that‚Äôs being disrupted and going bankrupt that‚Äôs about to do another share offering
2021-06-22 11:12:12,wallstreetbets,"I am interested in seeing what P&D is on the menu, which stock is pushed and how these comments differ from one another. I want to learn how to see through it and understand how this play looks like, how to identify red flags etc in WSB P&D through market observation. This and maybe help some people being careful at least. It's fine to buy P&D, just don't diamond fucking hand them. Get while it's still hot, take some money, leave before shit hits fan. Don't think ""it will go back up"" when jump into P&D and you can still make money."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Soho House Retards Are any of you autists members?


The parent company of Soho House which contains the Soho House worldwide clubs, Soho Works (read below), Electric Cinemas (these make AMC ones look like fun schoolgirl projects) their own furniture brand Soho Home, and glassware brand Barwell, in addition to offshoot clubs like The Ned in London‚Äôs Square Mile and Scorpios in Mykonos is headed to IPO on the NYSE under the ticker $MCG for a valuation of between $2b to $4b 

Some quick facts:

- The IPO will be overseen by JPM and Goldman

- But ‚ÄòWTF is soho house you retard?‚Äô I hear you ask: They are an exclusive members club for those working in the creative sector (but who also tend to be trust fund kids, bankers masking as art philanthropists - your average blue-armpit-hair Marxist artist isn‚Äôt paying $18 a cocktail but they‚Äôre always packed and getting a rooftop seat in London or New York is near impossible atm

- Their F&B margins are insane 

- Kim Kardashian has been rejected a membership over a dozen times

- haven‚Äôt turned a profit due to aggressive Goldman-backed expansion (see below): this year alone there will be openings in Rome, Tel Aviv, Brighton, Paris and London‚Äôs Strand just opened.

- they have recently made an incredible shift towards turning the membership into a digital socialising network for their members with 7-figure investments into their app alone that has clubhouse like features, noticeboards, video chat, and frankly a more useful social tool than boomer Facebook and other cancerous ‚Äòsocial‚Äô media apps: the idea being that since the members are all vetted (you need a proposer and a seconder to be granted membership) they are much more likely to reach out and socially engage with one a other 

- they have a WeWork competitor called Soho Works which is frankly nicer, cooler and more of a social status catch for trust fund kids working on their ‚Äòstartup‚Äô  than prime retard masayoshi son‚Äôs loss porn brand WeWork

- the principle holders are billionaire Ron Burkle, the founder Nick Jones, and British entrepreneur and CEO of caprice holdings, Richard Caring.

- Goldman Sachs is placing a big bet on the growth of Soho House, with a $770m (¬£560m) loan to further allow for aggressive expansion 

- it‚Äôs so private your wife can meet all her boyfriends there and since photography is prohibited you can still hold your head high in your community 

- Profits at Soho House soared 23% to ¬£31.7m in 2016 revenues up by a similar margin to ¬£273.6m.

- Turnover jumped again in the first half of 2017 by 28%, buoyed by new openings

- They made ¬£293 million (approximately $411 million) in revenues in 2019, about half of which originated from food and drink revenues and 20 percent from recurring payments by members. The rest originated from housewares.

- it‚Äôs very pandemic/crisis proof because of being able to draw down on waitlists, according to the FT: ‚ÄúSoho House has been able to continue its aggressive expansion through a mixture of cost cuts, fundraising and incoming membership fees.

‚ÄúOur membership model is pretty robust through a serious crisis,‚Äù said Mr Jones, who reckoned that the lengthy wait to become a member ‚Äî up to 18 months in some cases ‚Äî put people off cancelling.‚Äù

He also told CITY A.M.; ‚Äòif the business needed more money post-pandemic, it would let in its ‚Äúhuge‚Äù waiting list of 50,000 people.‚Äô

- because of this current members are also reluctant to give up their membership because it‚Äôs so difficult to get in to start with 

Now if you don‚Äôt mind I‚Äôm going to go back to drinking my $9 matcha latte at the New York one."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The MOST American Stock One Can Buy Is.... MP Materials. Ticker symbol MP. I can make this sophisticated but will keep it short.

The hot topic seems for ever are electrical vehicles.  And if anyone thinks we here in the USA has a clear cut advantage; you're mistaken.

You can be the most talented cook in the world and make the greatest steaks, but what happens if you have no access to cows? Your talent is irrelevant!!!

Listen to these FACTS carefully:

Without the ingredients such as you can't make a steak without cows; without RARE EARTH ELEMENTS, there is no such thing as an electric car.

So the talented engineers of electric cars in the USA have a problem. The problem? 85%. Yes 85% of the world's RARE EARTH ELEMENTS, the ingredients needed to make an electric car, comes from China!!! Yes China. You can say 95% of Tesla's parts are Chinese. And now China is in the electric car game in an ALL IN fashion. And I am talking ALL IN!!! Do you guys really think the Chinese will first support the Chinese electric car manufacturers or foreign ones like Tesla? China has TWO billion people and they are LITERALLY at the brink of converting the entire country into a highway system. Imagine when cars first came to America. That is whats going on in China and ALL of these cars will be electric. 

So the demand for RARE EARTH MATERIALS will go through the roof in which China WILL HAVE to ostracize all other nations and ONLY give their rare earth elements to their OWN electric car manufacturers period. Its common sense. Human behavior. Market behavior.  Lets not be naive.

But, we have been given a GIFT from the EV gods. MP. MP is the ONLY rare earth elements miners in the ENTIRE United States and heres the good news, they account for 15% of the entire world's rare earth elements!!! Without MP, trust me electric cars in the United States would be risky because we are 1000 percent dependent on China. But, MP takes us off the hook. 

With MP, we prevent geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. Oh yes thats where electric cars are going. Its no different than the missile race of the 80s between Russia and America.  Ev cars are the NEXT big thing for economies because with EV we also must consider autonomous driving that would change the world. So EV is not just a green save the planet play.

Back to MP. Our United States EV makers are sooo lucky to have the SECOND largest rare earth miner in the world to support the United States electric vehicle car makers! And the company is ALREADY profitable and growing like weeds.  They are growth story that is already profitable with no debt!!!! As solid of a stock in this situation as you can get.

But, yet....yet TWENTY PERCENT of MP stock is short. I've done zillions of hours of research where many think the Chinese are shorting it and many have other theories. And the EXPERTS in consensus continue to say you have to be crazy to short such a stock destined for greatness. 

MP protects us ALL in the United States literally.  They are our protectors for the EV battle and race. And I hope we all can understand this. That without MP, electric cars in the US long term is a pipe dream. We need OUR VERY own to supply the United States with the ingredients (rare earth elements) to make EV vehicles.  Without the mega success of MP,  what happens if China tells are US electric vehicle manufacturers, ""sorry we are low on supply this year and we cannot provide you with the elements you need."" That WOULD happen 1000% and it would send a shock to our ev markets. But, with MP we would never ever have a supply issue and hence because MP is our very own and with government subsidies etc- will help our own EV manufacturers to produce even cheaper. 

MP is a NATIONAL SECURITY play PLUS a phenomenal profitable company that LITERALLY has the largest rare earth mining in North America. YET IT IS SHORTED 20%......Folks TWENTY PERCENT......Now let's not be naive. Ask yourselves who would want MP to fail? Let's not be naive. Obviously this highly shorted tells me, someone is scared of MPs success and I believe its geopolitical.  As Americans lets drive these shorts out of this PURE AMERICAN SECURITY company so MP can supply US EV MAKERS FOREVER! Lets burn the shorts here. And the stock is pure fundamentals as well. JP Morgan recently few days ago put an outperform overweight rating on it.

Lets show MP we have their backs as they have our US EV makers back!"

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"This Housing-Boom Star Ticks All the Boxes The company is UWM Holdings Corp. (NYSE: UWMC), a wholesale-mortgage firm and a textbook example of a low-priced stock with a great dividend and a bright future.

It has the right business model; it provides funding to mortgage brokers as opposed to consumers. UWM underwrites and provides closing documentation and then funds residential mortgage loans originated by independent mortgage brokers, correspondents, small banks, and local credit unions.

Back in January, UWM Holdings just went public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) ‚Äì a ""New Age IPO"" vehicle I told my readers about earlier this year.

That said, even though UWM is newly arrived to the public markets, it's been around the block a few times; UWM Holdings is the parent of United Wholesale Mortgage, which has been in business since 1986.

The truth is UWM is as much a tech story as it is a mortgage story. The company develops most of the technology it uses to underwrite and process loans easier and more efficiently. UWM's platforms make it possible for its commercial customers to build, brand, and service their own mortgage offerings.


Options Trading Guide

There's a surprising secret that separates trading masters from the folks fighting over Wall Street's table scraps.

LEARN MORE
For the past six years, that company has been the largest wholesale mortgage lender in a U.S. market that's getting hotter virtually by the hour; most analysts don't see it ending anytime soon.

That makes the housing boom one of the single most powerful profit trends there is right now, and UWM is wired in tight.

The numbers are mouthwatering‚Ä¶

UWM controlled 34% of the wholesale mortgage market last year. Current forecasts call for that market share figure to hit 50% by 2026, when the wholesale channel is projected to be worth $685 billion ‚Äì nearly 90% higher than it is today.

Wall Street's consensus forecast is for EPS to grow almost 80% a year for each of the next five years. That kind of growth could send this stock right into the stratosphere.

And it's available right now for $9.09 a share.

If those earnings forecasts prove out, and the shares moved in lockstep, you'd be talking about a stock price of $185 a share five years from now ‚Äì better than a 1,935% return, not including dividends. Even if the stock did just one-third of that ‚Äì hitting $60 ‚Äì you'd be looking at a 560% gain.

And frankly, no matter what price UWM hits ‚Äì or how long it takes to get there ‚Äì you'll be well-paid to wait. Right now, shares of UWM Holdings pay a quarterly dividend of $0.10 each, or $0.40 a year.

At a recent share price of $9.10, that's a dividend yield of nearly 4.4%.

That's a no-brainer in a world where 10-year U.S. Treasury is yielding 1.4%. You'd earn more than three times the market rate while you wait for UWM shares to hit $60 ‚Äì and quite likely far beyond that.

Having a company pay you ‚Äì and pay you well ‚Äì while you're waiting to make a fortune on its stock is about the best deal you can get.

Anywhere.

And when that pay-while-you-own-it stock can be bought for less than 10 bucks a share ‚Äì well, that really is the ultimate cheap stock.[source ](https://moneymorning.com/2021/06/22/buy-this-9-small-cap-dividend-stock-before-it-gets-to-60/)"

2021-06-22 13:58:03,wallstreetbets,"Its not a housing boom. Its a housing bubble. People are not buying homes en masse, because there isn't that many on the market. This actually hurts UWMC, because there are less mortgages going out."

2021-06-22 11:10:49,wallstreetbets,"I agree. UWMC is a pump and dump from the MM. Always good news, never real results. Those who bought in on the retail side came from FOMO, and are in the echo chamber now.."

For those of your out of the loop on CLOV, the early retail buy-in triggered a upward gamma squeeze followed by a downward gamma squeeze as short term investors sold off their positions."

2021-06-22 09:54:22,wallstreetbets,It's a different vaccine and works differently to achieve immunity. Covaxin could be the booster shot of choice. Also safest vaccine so far. Is ocugen going to be successful? LOL who knows

The woman smoked her whole life and is obese.  You can go ahead and say it, I know the puts on your mother comment is coming‚Ä¶"
2021-06-22 17:18:59,wallstreetbets,"This is important. Covid isn't going away any time soon, and there's a strong possibility we could be seeing significant decline in immunity over relatively short time horizons. Wide defense against all the possibility variants is going to be valued more than any defense against any single variant.

Regardless, options are going to matter as Covid vaccines become a annual or biennial necessities the world over. OCGN will find its niche and be profitable I'm sure.

We just have to hope that this lawsuit fails, and so it should. Any pharmaceutical or healthcare company that puts short-term investor happiness ahead of doing what's best for people's health isn't to be trusted. The fact that they were brave enough to listen to the advice they were being given and abandon EUA to go for full approval first is admirable.

Salty investors just need to hold."

2021-06-22 08:57:13,wallstreetbets,Nah. Puts are too conservative a play here. Calls on $ROPE on the other hand...
2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Who wants to be an African oil tycoon? 100 billion barrels or more! This is for a company called ReconAfrica. The first company I bring up is so you can get the history.

Craig Steinke, CEO of Renaissance Oil, co-founder, major shareholder and Director of Renaissance Oil Corp. has over 25 years of extensive experience in the global oil and gas industry, specializing in large scale, new play development.

So there‚Äôs the CEO of that oil company and last year he literally gave the Mexican government the finger. They were preventing fracking for that company after bitching out on their promise. He basically told them to their face publicly ‚ÄúFuck you, we‚Äôll go somewhere else.‚Äù

Why was he so confident? Because he‚Äôs also started another company ReconAfrica that trades under $RECO on the Toronto Stock Exchange. He got some aeromagnetic data that somehow went overlooked probably for political reasons before. But even based on his conservative estimates they could be sitting on 100 billion barrels of light oil (for oil, light is the good kind, it‚Äôs easier to transport, pipe and refine).

They‚Äôre in the middle of drilling their second test well. Their first test well already had oil shows. Their second test well is half done and also already had positive results. They‚Äôre going to be doing a 2D seismic survey soon as well as another test well. There‚Äôs also talk (publicly verified talk) that the first well is just temporarily capped and will be re-evaluated for potential extraction.

They have a deal with the Namibian government for a 25 year production license on commercial discovery.

Ignore some of the wording on their site about ‚ÄúThe Government gets the Final Say‚Äù because a bunch of activists and environmentalists tried to accuse them of raping and pillaging when really they‚Äôve had a deal with the government and were welcomed with the broke open arms of an African nation desperate to get on the GDP map.

I‚Äôm bullish because they‚Äôre confident enough in their discovery that ReconAfrica is now buying Renaissance Oil and they were also confident enough based on their results that NAMCOR, a Namibian Government entity with a 10% stake, was willing to enter into a JOA with them. That means joint operating agreement and they were confident enough to take on the massive risk that comes with that based on the oil exploration and good results so far.

There‚Äôs a lot of FUD floating around right now. They‚Äôre accused of endangering elephants, driving locals off their land, round robin deals and misleading investors. Why? Probably because they have a massive discovery and all the environmentalists including National Geographic want to shut them down.

But Namibia‚Äôs government obviously gets the final say on any of this and they desperately need the job creation and the revenue to put themselves on the map. They themselves have gone to great lengths to debunk a lot of those claims.

The company has a market cap right now of Canadian $1.94 billion. Which is basically small peas compared to what it could become (potentially trillions of dollars if this is as big as they think it is).

Shares are like $12 Canadian right now but once the play is de-risked and they have a better idea of what they‚Äôre sitting on and all the way up to production and JVs they could theoretically go as high as quadruple digits.

It‚Äôs also all onshore. No ocean involved. Conventional oil. No fracking (most likely lol). And there are like 3 decent short term catalysts left to go. Completion of well 2, 2D seismic survey data and completion of well 3.

Of course there‚Äôs a chance the whole thing could go tits up but that‚Äôs becoming less and less likely as they continue to de-risk the play.

Disclosure, I‚Äôve been loading up shares since January so I‚Äôm loaded and have already had a 300% increase but I‚Äôm holding because this thing still has so much room to run that it boggles my imagination and I‚Äôm daydreaming of becoming a millionaire.

But think about it this way, you basically get to go back in time and invest in Texas oil right when the Permian basin was discovered. Of course you might also lose all your money but based on the posts here you‚Äôd just brag about it for internet points anyway so somehow I don‚Äôt think losing money is a threat to you.

I even wrote a theme song for you.

‚ÄúIt's gonna take a lot to of horsepower to drill you. There's nothing that a hundred billion tendies or more couldn‚Äôt do. I bless the gains down in Africa. Gonna take some time to get the lambo we never had (ooh, ooh)‚Äù"

2021-06-22 11:30:00,wallstreetbets,"Hello,

I am Barr. Phillip Butulezi, an attorney of law to a deceased Immigrant property Magnate, who was based in the U.K, also referred to as my client.

On the 25th of July 2000, my client, his wife, and their two Children died in the Air France concord plane crash bound for New York. They were on their way to a world cruise.

Prior to that accident and since then, I have been managing Mr Schoeler's properties here in the U.K. Some of these properties, at the time of the accident, were already put on sale. I, as his attorney, monitored the sale of the properties, and the depositing of the proceeds into Mr Schoeler's main U.K bank account. I have contacted you initially to assist me in repatriating the money, and possibly ownership of some of the property left behind by my client; this is to prevent ownership of both reverting to the state. By U.K law, ownership of funds in current bank accounts unattended for six years will automatically revert back to her majesty's government treasury. However, the legal procedure to activate this takes about three months, of which there are just about two months left.

The bank has recently issued me a notice to provide details of any of Mr Schoeler's next of kin within a short period of time, this thereby triggers off the procedure of reverting ownership of the funds to her majesty's government. My Late client's main Uk bank account is valued at fifteen million, five hundred thousand U.S dollars ($15.5m). Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any relatives of my late client in the last six years; and with the bank indicating that they now wish to shortly start the procedure of reversion of ownership of the funds to the state, I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. And then you in turn can send me my share of the money. The ratio for the sharing of the funds will be fifty per cent (50%) to me, forty per cent (40%) to you, and ten per cent (10%) for miscellaneous expenses that might arise. I have all the necessary information that will be used to back up any claim we may make..

All I require is your honest co-operation and confidentiality to enable us sees this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Trust me, as Mr Schoeler's attorney; this is a risk-free transaction. Please send me your full names, address, and your telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss this matter further.

I very much look forward to a swift response from you."

I raised 5 kids and we didn‚Äôt have much money and GME came in real handy back then. I support AMC also but we barely ever went to movies because a family of 7 cost ALOTüòÆSo that‚Äôs why I‚Äôll be behind GME NO MATTER WHAT

2021-06-22 09:06:40,wallstreetbets,"greed, spite, envy, jealousy, lust for revenge... you pick it.

but yes, gme bears arguments are not based in reality and observable facts. those all went out of the window when they became debt free and thus impossible to default."
2021-06-22 10:46:54,wallstreetbets,"There is some reason to be skeptical that they can ever reach their current valuation though. Gaming industry will be all about market share. GME has a ton of opportunity and is in a great position to acquire a large part of future market share but nothing is guaranteed. Microsoft is making it increasingly difficult to need any middle man in its products for instance. Games are downloaded straight to Xbox, same with Playstation and Steam on PC. Microsoft and Netflix are also entering the cloud gaming space. Facebook, Microsoft, Sony, and others are all chasing VR.

So there are some legitimate concerns. A lot GME could do, especially in emerging tech spaces like VR/AR/E-Sports. I love the idea of them acquiring Corsair somehow. Elgato and SCUF are fantastic brands. They'll have to do a lot more than that to maintain a $21B market cap though.

I'm not a bear and I don't own any GME. I just like gaming. Always good to keep an eye on the downsides of the stocks you own though. Unbridled optimism usually creates bag holders."
2021-06-22 11:42:14,wallstreetbets,Until they fix that godforsaken abomination they call a website I don't know what to think.
2021-06-22 15:00:50,wallstreetbets,"Probably because this went from waiting for the squeeze into fundamentals. Does the price actually match the valuation and current stock price? If the squeeze is somehow over than it's overpriced. If it's not, the price is still inflated by the holding."
2021-06-22 13:08:18,wallstreetbets,"because they don't really do anything but sell video games, and there are numerous other online vendors that do it much better, and most actual platforms like xbox and PS are just going to sell their exclusive titles directly from the consoles themselves online and do away with physical games altogether.

weird that this went away from being a wild cash grab short squeeze to somehow gamestop becoming the next amazon or some shit"
2021-06-22 10:39:49,wallstreetbets,Some people are paid to be bearish on GME here sir.
2021-06-22 14:00:45,wallstreetbets,"It's one thing to be bearish at $5 or $17 or even $50.  That's probably silly at this point.

But the stock is at $200+.   It's not hard to argue that it's ""priced in"" for a couple years into the future."
2021-06-22 14:18:04,wallstreetbets,"Because it‚Äôs trading at $200 which is fucking retarded. Just because a company is doing well doesn‚Äôt justify its instantaneous price.

Without the bullshit voodoo short squeeze that will never happen, this valuation is not accurate"
2021-06-22 09:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Can they make money on there fundamentals?   


Show me at least one way how they can make money with there company and be profitable."
2021-06-22 07:01:10,wallstreetbets,Like at least 5
2021-06-22 09:49:29,wallstreetbets,Fuck they could probably stock up on like 5 graphics cards at this point with that kind of money.
2021-06-22 07:21:20,wallstreetbets,They can also buy lots of GME FDs

2021-06-22 19:27:22,wallstreetbets,Im pretty sour the announcement was this morning on finishing the share offering. I was counting on a few more days. I cashed out at 250 and planned on buying back in this morning under 200 for 25% more shares. I was trying to time it just before the ATMO finished. I was pretty certain it'd be this week but not fucking today. Oh well. Back in at 210 this morning.

2021-06-22 09:09:56,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs been trading between $215 & $219 in pre-market already‚Ä¶
2021-06-22 12:53:59,wallstreetbets,"Or would be bad **IF** there was evidence of covering resulting from the dilution.  **There is not.**. MOREOVER, situation is only bad if of doesn't advance the company.  ~11% dilution for almost $2B is a good thing here.

April, 3.5M shares cost us ~$22/share over 5d. That was a low of ~$132.  Price advanced $230 over the next 2m to ~$343.  This, June dilution of 5M, cost us ~$44 over ~8d for a low of ~$197.

Both times the ""disconnected fundamentals"" have been **improved**.  This is not relevant to **current** price.  But, it is relevant **AFTER** the squeeze.  Shorts **HAVE NOT** covered.

Dunna listen to people talking about fundamentals.  It's a bullshit argument.  If price is disconnected from fundamentals, then they don't matter and you can't use them to talk about price."
2021-06-22 12:11:28,wallstreetbets,"Exactly what I was thinking.

I really don't understand how this could be good news."
2021-06-22 10:33:48,wallstreetbets,"its both, and barely diluted the float 3.5 and 5 million shares together is nothing compared to the true short position that they didnt even attempt to cover yet, the price is wrong bitch!!!!"

2021-06-22 09:14:47,wallstreetbets,"You know‚Ä¶ this is actually the purpose of taking a company public. It is to allow the public to invest and grow the company through raising capital.

2021-06-22 09:18:21,wallstreetbets,"If they do something with the money to raise the stock price, we will get it back."

2021-06-22 09:59:55,wallstreetbets,"If they didn't cover at 40, they won't at 200+. And they certainly didn't buy enough to cover the discrepancy. Enough to hold off being called to pay up? Maybe for now."
2021-06-22 09:07:06,wallstreetbets,"of course that's what it means.

And if there was actually a large demand for shares to cover shorts they would have been bought."

I know it‚Äôs $220, but in March it was only $39!!!! Could have also got in then.

Think of it as a lotto ticket. The $220 could be worth hundreds or even thousands one day.

Also keep in mind, GameStop plans on closing all of those physical locations, and we LIKE that.

It means less overhead. Lower overall costs for them to run the company.

DoorDash and Uber is hiring if you don‚Äôt like GS anymore. I wouldn‚Äôt want to work there either. And soon, there won‚Äôt be a store there left for you to work at.

Best of luck in all your endeavors.

2021-06-22 18:03:54,wallstreetbets,"I only 1/2 agree with you.

1) GameStop WAS a shitty business. I remember those rip-off trade-ins as a kid.

Perhaps that‚Äôs part of why it‚Äôs dying.

2) the leadership of GME has completely changed. I think it‚Äôs changed for the better.

Why do I think that?

Because I am a customer of Chewy.com and the level of customer support is OUTSTANDING!!!!!

There is a reason, why Chewy was able to steal market from Amazon and Petco.

It‚Äôs because Ryan Cohen and his team are fucking amazing!

True. Death to the old GameStop. But  ALL HAIL, THE NEW GAMESTOP!!!"
2021-06-22 17:45:59,wallstreetbets,"Someone downvoted you, so I came here and upvoted you.

To the moon with this ATM $1.1 BILLION PROFIT that GME just made today. Holy fuck!"
2021-06-22 17:43:14,wallstreetbets,"Because if you are a Shorter of GME, you are shorting because you think the company fundamentals suck.

With news like this, it makes the case for staying Short, less desirable, because the company fundamentals are changing.

They went from being in debt, to paying off all of the debt, to generating $3 BILLION this year which will fund the enormous transformation.

AMC did the same thing, and what happened shortly after? The stock sky rocketed.

I think GameStop is going to explode BEFORE THE END OF THIS MONTH

2021-06-22 08:08:01,wallstreetbets,They didn‚Äôt buy them at $40 or $150 why would you think they would have bought them @$225?
2021-06-22 08:06:21,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no. It fucks over short positions further as the company is cash-rich and able to pivot into a tech company. So eventually those have to cover, which raises the price.

In the immediate term I‚Äôm hoping the bounce-back timing is perfect for more frequent margin calls, Thursday‚Äôs FTD cycle and Friday‚Äôs entry to the Russell 1000. 

The squeeze comes from increased price requiring a close-out of short positions. The offering dropped price by $100 and that did hurt it, but we can see an uptick in price begin now. You are right though, it gives ammunition for the shorts, and it kinda looks like that‚Äôs been used over the last few trading days also."
2021-06-22 08:53:18,wallstreetbets,It squeezed in january and it won't squeeze again

2021-06-22 17:01:12,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, of blockbuster had a board that was cool with the Netflix model and bought them out when they had the chance, they would've been saved. Blockbuster failed because it failed to adapt it's business model, which they had plenty of time to pivot too before Netflix really blew up. 

Saying nothing could have saved them is just false, they did stupid decisions, and if they had another team there is a chance they could've won out with Netflix with a streaming model because at the time blockbuster had the branding going for it."

The narrative from bears like you is always ""oh no dilution"" but really, there is no such thing as dilution! It's 5 million more shares and 1 billion more money in their bank account. so 1 billion more in assets to back those shares up. the balance stays the same.

And since I am a long stockholder, i believe the company can use the money better than other companies that i didn't buy.

so really, i would love it if they sell 1 billion more in shares, or 5 billion or even 100 billion. as long as they know what to do with the money, have a business plan and the ace management team in place, i will happily be part of the journey.

2021-06-22 11:26:04,wallstreetbets,"It's not talked about much, but GameStop does have a partnership with Microsoft. Also their market cap is about 15bil right now"
2021-06-22 11:52:28,wallstreetbets,"Your first paragraph pretty much surmises the Ryan Cohens original reasoning for deciding to get involved in GameStop pretty well. In the letter he wrote to the board in 2020 he pretty much laid out the challenges that the company would have if they did not make significant changes to their business model. 

That being said I feel like a lot of gamers underestimate the value of selling physical copies of software still has in 2021. Yeah if you are buying games exclusively for your own use then having an entirely digital game library is ideal. But you only need to go to the Nintendo switch subreddit and you will find several posts from parents confused about why the game the bought digitally for their one kids switch can't be used by their other kid. Parents don't want to have to plan out which console they purchase a game for so that their kids aren't fighting over one switch when the other isn't being used when they can just have a physical game library that can be played on any device. So while I agree that the future is most likely going to be heading towards exclusively digital releases we are at *least* a console cycle away from getting there, which is what like 7 years from now? The legacy business isn't going to become obsolete overnight. That gives the company time to implement a bold change in direction that they have been alluding towards since November 2020.

So then the question for those people becomes why not just buy the game on Amazon or Walmart or whatever, why gamestop? Well Gamestop has significantly improved their power up rewards system. Each month a power up member gets a $5 coupon, access to some digital content and more credit on trades as well as other benefits. Again if you are buying games for your kids a $5 coupon each month on top of getting extra credit for trade ins is a pretty good incentive. The company also understands that fast, free delivery is an absolute must to compete with other major online retailers. Last earnings they announced they are in the process of building a major distribution center somewhere in the north east to streamline their online order flow.

Outside of just console hardware/software sales Gamestop has been steadily increasing their catalog to include PC components, gaming monitors, etc. I don't remember where I saw it but I remember the end goal is for them to have build a pc kiosks in store which would be a unique service that will be in high demand for gamers for the foreseeable future. 

As far as how they could compete in the digital game market they could implement their power up rewards in such a way that it benefits their customers to shop on their platform. If you get a $5 coupon each month to download a game from gamestop why would you use steam? There was also a rumor a while ago that the company would be offering digital trade ins as well which would be a *huge* incentive to use their platform. How many games are in your steam library that you haven't touched in years? Wouldn't it be nice to get *something* back for them to put towards the other dozen games on your wishlist?

Then as you mentioned GameStop has made it known that they want to get into the esports market in a meaningful way. What that would look like I couldn't tell you but I'm sure they have a plan for that.

Then you have the team that they have been building up. There are *Big* names from Google and Amazon who have managed some of the largest ecommerce markets, as well as members of Cohens former Chewy team that built a customer service model that allowed them to compete with Amazon when they were just a start-up. 

Sherman just stepped down and the new CEO has just started/is about to start. The company has cleared virtually all debt from its books and has significantly reduced their overhead by closing down underperfoming stores. They also have raised a ton of cash from the shelf offering in addition to 2 strong sales qtrs on the backs of the new console cycle which they have said again and again they are going to use to accelerate their transformation into a customer obsessed ecommerce platform. I don't see how somebody looks at all that and doesn't understand why people think this is a solid growth investment."
2021-06-22 11:55:16,wallstreetbets,Thank goodness I‚Äôm not the only one thinking they should partner with CRSR
2021-06-22 12:54:05,wallstreetbets,There's 0 bear thesis for GME. You posed good points but the gaming industry is a $200 billion/year industry and Gamestop is uniquely positioned for numerous reasons that I shouldn't really have to layout.
2021-06-22 18:35:25,wallstreetbets,"The current price is holding me back. If we were at $90 right now this would be a definite buy. Long term it's gonna be hard to keep this up. I believe they have a future, I'm just not sure that future entails them dominating a gaming market that revolves around digital content which would be required to match their current valuation"
2021-06-22 14:04:56,wallstreetbets,"The board has changed significantly, the CEO has changed, and they've poached great talent.  The worst assumption you could possibly make is that the board transformed itself at Ryan Cohen's urging only to keep employing the same loser strategy.

Also, people have been crying about the death of physical media for a generation now.  Cohen didn't become chair just to jack off all day.

Maybe their play works in the end, maybe not, but don't act confused about it."

Then look at the list of people they've hired, add to that the cash they've accumulated to carry out the plan and the answer is an emphatic yes."
2021-06-22 10:10:23,wallstreetbets,"If the gaming industry wasn't profitable it wouldn't exist.

Nah, working companies do not like to raise capital on the back of their investors."
2021-06-22 10:25:05,wallstreetbets,"Diluting shares hurts investors and is typically done for struggling companies. Your second point is fine, that they are in essence borrowing from investors to build a company that returns it in the future, but at no point should issuing more shares be seen as the purpose of taking a company public."

That‚Äôs a 39% increase in shares available. Do you realize how incredibly massive that is to a short squeeze? 

Almost all of your DD comes with a disclaimer that says ‚Äúthis is not finanacial advice.‚Äù The ONLY people required to say that are people that are working in finance. In other words hedge funds. 

Btw, this IS financial advice. A shill or hedge fund would never say that because they risk their license and possibly fines or criminal charges. 

A regular Joe Schmoe on the internet cannot be fined for offering financial advice in a public forum unless they are directly profiting from it. 

As for valuation, while having some cash on hand is nice, it‚Äôs still a dying company hemorrhaging money everyday. 

Could they turn it around and become profitable? Yeah, probably, especially with the cash they have raised. But will they be able to justify a 50billion market cap?  Not even close."

2021-06-22 17:32:12,wallstreetbets,"Explain to me how wrong I am.

Bestow upon me the knowledge I lack that explains how the brick and mortar retail of new and used games has a future.

Disks and cartridges are purposefully being phased out by the developers... Full stop. This point cannot be argued seriously. The resale of discs and cartridges is an easily fixable revenue leak. The only thing holding it back has been storage. Not anymore.

So that leaves.... Retail? Shirts? Shoes? Amiibos? Hot Topic is around the corner past Footlocker.

The new board is going to nurture and direct a move to the digital marketplace and compete with Steam, Epic, GOG, Greenman, Origin, and Uplay?

Ok... Next have them enter the Cola market and succeed against those brands.

They are a good company with no future. They have property and inventory. That's it. No IP, no MVP, no actual substance for remaining afloat once this sub moves on to boosting Kodak.

It was a fun ride. But as of this morning, I hold 0 shares. No regrets. Now I'm off to make a small deposit into a local community bank located somewhere with a nice climate, and hire a divorce attorney so my wife can finally spend some time with her boyfriend."

We are talking about an out-dated brick and mortar business model.

2021-06-22 11:55:14,wallstreetbets,"It's not talked about much!? I've seen it mentioned several thousand times on Reddit. I assume it is not an indefinite partnership though and Microsoft is certainly trying to cut out anyone if it means they can increase revenue and further silo off their market share.

I'm seeing $20.92B on my brokerage right now but I don't know. same goes for $15B. It just assumes that a lot of things go right. They could all go right but, as with a stock like Palantir, everything going right just means they catch up to their valuation. IMO there isn't some massive amount of upside on the current price right around the corner. 

This is all outside of a potential squeeze of course. I'm way too stupid to be able to verify outstanding shorts in any way so I steer clear of that one."
2021-06-22 12:33:54,wallstreetbets,"Yea, like I said, all of those things could go right for them but my original comment was in reply to your first. You said no one could be bearish on this company except from spite and I disagree for the reasons already stated. 

I also disagree with your 7 year timeline on physical copies being obsolete. They'll be around in some form for a while but neither my Xbox nor my two laptops even have a disk drive. Physical copies are already quickly becoming a small niche.

I wish you well, honestly. I'm not buying puts on GME or anything. Just giving my take. I'm all for GME crushing it and making some millionaires along the way. I just think they're fighting more of an uphill battle than many let on. I do think Cohen will figure out how to make the successful, its more the current valuation vs. the timeline to turnaround that makes me pause."
2021-06-22 12:57:27,wallstreetbets,To each their own. Hope you go to the moon.
2021-06-22 14:07:19,wallstreetbets,"let's be honest, there was a reason GME got shorted to high hell and back before this all went crazy. just bizarre that this turned from a crazy technical play for a short squeeze into some GME cult pump and dump thing. you do you I guess.

I already had my fun and cashed out at like $350 when I saw the chance, to me, that WAS the squeeze. not sure exactly what people are waiting for or expecting here. even if GME totally turns its business around and becomes huge, the stock price seems wildly overvalued for something that was trading at like $3 a year ago."

What are Burry's, Gill and Cohen's plan? While Burry is already out of GME."

Feel really dumb for doing that, but I sold the other half  at the second peak so I feel pretty lucky I didn't lose more."
2021-06-22 19:47:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah I made alot of profit. But my plan was to sell as soon as they announced the share offering and buy back in when the price was at its lowest just BEFORE they finished selling shares to cash in on the jump after the announcement they had finished. So my timing was off by literally one day and I missed out on a 10% jump I had been anticipating for weeks.  But i cant be too sour because I rolled a bunch over into SPCE a couple weeks ago and she had a big day today too lol.
2021-06-22 10:11:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that I‚Äôve noticed too. There‚Äôs still good faith in GME here tho, just not the levels seen in January"

2021-06-22 19:03:13,wallstreetbets,What happens if GME never goes to a high enough point that it bankrupt what few firms still have a net short position? Why can't investors take the opposite position and just sell and short and hold forever?
2021-06-22 11:31:37,wallstreetbets,I've never seen raising 2 billion dollars without taking on a cent of debt as a bearish sign but here you are
2021-06-22 10:28:39,wallstreetbets,"Fine. It isn‚Äôt the main reason but going public makes raising capital through offerings one option. Arguably if people are willing to gobble offering up, it is better than taking on debt. I mean GME is obviously no AMZN right now. And even AMZN did secondary offerings."
2021-06-22 11:18:42,wallstreetbets,"Oh yea, that totally makes sense.

And it sucks. I‚Äôve been there. Many of us have been there.

Like I mentioned, my only way out was to join the military. Eventually all of that Call Of Duty, Rainbow6, Ghost Recon gaming translated into REAL LIFE military.

I was fat too. I had to lose weight before they let me in. It was really scary. But I am so happy I made that choice.

I bought my first stock at the age of 35.

I joined the military at 19.

Oh and also Sherman may have sold a bunch of his shares. He had like 1.2 million or something? EDIT: Did a quick search on it, as of Apr 22 he had 925k shares, and a transition agreement awarded him an additional 200k shares. He probably is/will sell a good chunk of that, but once that's done there won't be nearly as much selling pressure as we've seen over the past couple weeks."
2021-06-22 17:45:28,wallstreetbets,"Traditionally, yeah. But considering a company like GameStop, where even some of the people leading the hype on its share price will say it is objectively ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù this actually brings quite a bit of tangible value to the company."

2021-06-22 07:29:10,wallstreetbets,"Thanks - I think we misunderstood. The share dilution has finished basically, and now they‚Äôve just got profits left in their hands. When the share dilution was announced, the market reacted, and has since then accepted/recovered. Now that they‚Äôve said the dilution is complete and they‚Äôre just sitting there with money in their hands, the market is reacting again. I suspect a short term pop of 10-15% and then a correction back down for a total gain of like 7%."
2021-06-22 07:31:19,wallstreetbets,"They've only announced it finished now, the price already dropped $100 since 9 June, DD already figured out they were completing the offering. Look at PM now."
2021-06-22 07:35:54,wallstreetbets,"it's because this poster does not understand how time works.

the offering **has happened in the past**, meaning forward facing, *in the future* the price will not tank. rather, the additional liquid cash can be used to invest and transform the business quicker and without taking any short cuts or making compromises. they can build exactly what they envision.

2021-06-22 14:20:24,wallstreetbets,"There was a place like that not far from me growing up (late 90s, early 00s). Had different times for tabletop games, card games, and also had a full on 16 computer LAN setup where we played Unreal Tournament, Counter Strike and any other game you could think of from that time. Really was fun being able to play Everquest or UO with 3 or 4 guild mmates all sitting together. From Friday afternoon to Sunday night, the LAN setup was always slammed, charging $8 an hour on weekends. 

I really hope GameStop can pull off something similar with that kind of social gaming in whatever brick and mortar locations they decide to keep open."

i personally bought in in the 30s in second week of jan and in the 40s in feb, but i also bought at the bottom of the cup and handle pattern recently at 130 and 140. 


saying ""the lucky few"" is misleading, i have to assume intentionally. 

the majority of people have bought in at that point. 

the diamond hands are still printing. i heard no whistle? 

we are currently at the handle of a three month cup and handle pattern. we're going up! daytrading this stock will lead to tears, since you miss the rocket moves when it goes.

I don't own GME anymore I paperhanded awhile ago, but by what definition or logic is this a dying business? 


Over the last year or so they've had an explosion in media popularity, they've replaced much of the board of directors and have just received a huge cash infusion by selling stock, which they sold at a price that was probably multiple times what the stock was worth a year ago? 



Overvalued? Yeah I'd say so. Will they follow through? Idk we'll see in 10 years.


But by no measure is this a dying business.


Edit; I'd also argue that they're poised to transition cause of ya know, the facts I mentioned above."

2021-06-22 09:48:10,wallstreetbets,"When they offer new shares, they sell them into the market diluting the share pool. This naturally lowers the price as it directly affects the supply and demand equation.

But then when we buy all those shares at an everage price of $220, it indicates to the market that there is still enough demand for the limited supply, hence why it's going up today."
2021-06-22 09:37:20,wallstreetbets,They sold 5 million new shares last week. That'll naturally drive the price down. The fact that it held $200 during that shows the strength of the stock.

2021-06-22 19:52:47,wallstreetbets,"Lol yeah, i just checked my post history. I posted this just last night:



""The ATM offering is well under way in my opinion. You dont announce it and then sit on your ass waiting for the price to bleed out on the news. You start trickling them out immediately. The whole point is to raise capital and obviously they want to get as close as the $255 per share max they filed for, for every share possible.  They want to issue all 5,000,000 at an average of at least $200.00 each, because a BILLION dollars in capital is a really nice number.

I cashed out at 260 and have been waiting for sub 200 to roll my money back in netting 20+% more total shares. My goal was to get back in just prior to the announcement the ATM offering is complete. Because when Cohen comes out and says we just raised a cool BILLION FUCKING DOLLARS cash money in the bank, its launch time. We just dipped under 2 bills today, so im back all in tomorrow at open."""

2021-06-22 19:08:59,wallstreetbets,And the rest of what I said?
2021-06-22 16:25:57,wallstreetbets,"Short ladder attack is when you go to home depot, get one of those 3 step foot ladders, then swing it in a low motion at someone's shins, causing their stonk price to collapse."
2021-06-22 12:32:19,wallstreetbets,fucking ridiculous how much you're getting downvoted for not buying in to all this squeeze shit. WSB is fucking dead
2021-06-22 18:03:42,wallstreetbets,Believe me that wasn't the only problem with your comment
2021-06-22 13:21:49,wallstreetbets,"But apes still believe them to be true. 

Which it would be impossible for any of those to be true with out collapsing the economy. 

You really think 10m per share could be paid with out collapsing everything? 

10m * 74m shares is more money than exists in the world."
2021-06-22 13:02:53,wallstreetbets,"Thats because you‚Äôre bagholder, otherwise it would bother you too. :)"
2021-06-22 09:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Just cause you see a speed limit sign doesn't mean you stop, get out, and burn the car.

I wish you didn't know what else to say.  We'd all be better off if that was true."
2021-06-22 12:21:33,wallstreetbets,"This ***IS*** wsb. As an ""elder"" apparently, I'd like to say, we're a bunch of retards here. There's literally no such thing as crediting or discrediting.

But since shills have shown up en masse maybe we need a way to know who's actually been around and who has suddenly spiked in activity?

Flotsam and jetsam in the seas of tendies!"
2021-06-22 10:15:19,wallstreetbets,"Ad hominem or 'to the man' is not when you call out someone's lack of history as a reason to distrust them. It's when you call them fat and therefore unable to analyze stock properly. 

It's not ad hominem if the criticism is relevant to the argument"
2021-06-22 09:56:31,wallstreetbets,If a 10-day old account jumps from ticker to ticker it is no longer an ad hominem attack. This is a much appreciated feature in the wake of this subreddit being absolutely dominated by primarily new accounts that all typically only talk about one stock only.
2021-06-22 10:45:26,wallstreetbets,"Stop spreading FUD.

Buy
Hold
Sell

Do what you will with your money and your investments. Literally NOBODY can tell you what you should be doing with that money. Reddit is NOT responsible for your fuck ups. If you made massive gains from WSB, great! Enjoy those tendies, but if you lost money because you didn‚Äôt do your DD and decided to chuck your rent money because a random Redditor said buy [TICKER], well then you very much deserve to lose it.

My opinion is my own and this is not FA!"
2021-06-22 19:28:35,wallstreetbets,Fap until it makes sense. Fap until it makes sense. I am not a bot. Fap

2021-06-22 08:56:55,wallstreetbets,Is your comment gonna be [deleted] in a month when it's not?
2021-06-22 10:06:24,wallstreetbets,"Hes not a shill, just an idiot with a big mouth ü§£"
2021-06-22 08:33:32,wallstreetbets,"I just think there will be a small market correction either mid day today or some time tomorrow. Then you will see some gradual climb. When I say dip, I'm not saying it's going ro drop 40 percent. My guess is it could reach 225-230 max today, drop back down just above 200, then we will see it climb from there. Or at least that's what I'm banking on because I sure is hell won't buy at market open after jumping 10 percent pre market."
2021-06-22 15:58:00,wallstreetbets,I still have nostalgia for brick weed.  I can't find it anywhere anymore.
2021-06-22 11:35:35,wallstreetbets,Big yes.

2021-06-22 07:48:39,wallstreetbets,Own a house in London that's rich bc no one really owns a house in London. Say hello to the queen for me.
2021-06-22 09:23:54,wallstreetbets,And chewy loses on every sale. It's another zombie that was put on the market bc it was losing a billion a year and they knew idiot investors don't read balance sheets.
2021-06-22 19:11:18,wallstreetbets,And what will you say when the stock is flat tomorrow?  Another excuse?
2021-06-22 09:48:27,wallstreetbets,"It'll probably depend, I've read (and I meant anyone could see) that they reloaded when it spiked again. If they made money on the way down, they may have enough to go for a while and ride every up and down, but that does mean they're not applying the pressure they used to, it's not like the stock can gradually fall from 10 to 9 to 8 dollars over a year now. It'll probably depend on each company and how they handled it. I'd imagine a bunch survive, most of them probably didn't write calls that got exercised."
2021-06-22 19:30:51,wallstreetbets,They won‚Äôt stop until the music does.
2021-06-22 09:27:05,wallstreetbets,Not to the extent that it was.

2021-06-22 09:30:45,wallstreetbets,Lol wsb is certainly something
2021-06-22 09:26:53,wallstreetbets,You're asking this in a thread about a company completing a at-the-market equity program that raised them a billion dollars? How fucking braindead can you be?
2021-06-22 10:11:38,wallstreetbets,You should delete this...it makes the apes look smart
2021-06-22 09:58:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, defend financial institutions exploiting loopholes!"
2021-06-22 12:51:19,wallstreetbets,As a dangling leftover of strip mall America yes it does. The faster we can turn these concreate husks back into greenspace the better off we will be.
2021-06-22 12:50:08,wallstreetbets,"Haha, good luck! I hope you go to the moon."
2021-06-22 19:20:45,wallstreetbets,Same. The stars are literally all aligned. This thing is primed ready to explode seriously.
2021-06-22 14:35:10,wallstreetbets,"and what, exactly, is the business model that is going to sustain their valuations?"
2021-06-22 09:22:53,wallstreetbets,"11 years. They're profitable on certain timeframes, but they have spent more money than they have earned. No guarantee they will ever earn more than their total expenditures. It might happen, it might not."
2021-06-22 13:22:41,wallstreetbets,"LoL.

Correlation =/= causation."
2021-06-22 13:15:33,wallstreetbets,"LoL.

Everyone of my lots is net positive.  I've doubled my position.

No, it doesn't bother me.

It bothers you because you're a whiny lil bitch who can only wish to be a bagholder seeing where price is headed.  Those $483s, were coming to pick them up."

2021-06-22 11:18:04,wallstreetbets,"No.  Insults are not ad hominem.

Discounting an argument base upon the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself, is ad hominem."
2021-06-22 09:19:52,wallstreetbets,"i never delete comments.

Are you selling me the calls? how about 100 jul 16th for three fiddy a pop?

if you're right you get 35k cold hard cash."
2021-06-22 10:55:43,wallstreetbets,I went to comment on the comment that went negative and the coward deleted it. I felt the need to bring balance.  WSB should be a place of pride when things go tits up including your god damn comments.
2021-06-22 08:44:03,wallstreetbets,"Lol... so when you say you think it's ""going to dip today"", you actually mean the price going up and then correcting down to support right around yesterday's close?  Never heard anyone call regular intraday volatility ""a dip"" before."
2021-06-22 17:11:13,wallstreetbets,Found some a couple months ago. It's worse than you remember.
2021-06-22 17:08:40,wallstreetbets,"There is currently a mids renaissance, it‚Äôs coming back fam"
2021-06-22 17:21:05,wallstreetbets,Lol no way... having to literally pick out the seeds and stems?
2021-06-22 08:58:39,wallstreetbets,"So I'll ask again. If it turns out you're wrong, would you admit it?"
2021-06-22 07:50:23,wallstreetbets,How's your silver doing these days
2021-06-22 07:56:07,wallstreetbets,"only people who shill silver don't own houses in london.

almost everyone i know owns their house. but then again, clearly we move in very different circles."
2021-06-22 08:22:27,wallstreetbets,Damn we found a genuine retard
2021-06-22 09:27:13,wallstreetbets,"You know who else lost a shit load of money reinvesting their entire revenue stream growing the company in their early years? I believe they were trying to sell books online. Can‚Äôt recall the name exactly, mind giving me a hand?"
2021-06-22 13:56:12,wallstreetbets,He belongs with us... he is truly retarded
2021-06-22 18:24:18,wallstreetbets,You are all retarded.
2021-06-22 10:17:31,wallstreetbets,"If they're loopholes, they're not illegal, but keep smoking your crack. I know its the only way to make the contradictions in your life and your portfolio make sense."
2021-06-22 12:53:03,wallstreetbets,Gamestops are single-handedly supporting strip malls? Strip malls would be converted back to nature?
2021-06-22 09:47:31,wallstreetbets,"Then short the stock, I dare you"
2021-06-22 11:02:59,wallstreetbets,Lol. People said the same thing about AMZN.
2021-06-22 13:32:04,wallstreetbets,"Are you just saying random things? 

I mean I expect as much from an ape."
2021-06-22 13:19:47,wallstreetbets,"Ouch, did I hit a nerve? Haha"
2021-06-22 10:03:27,wallstreetbets,"Dude sit down. If you can't even properly call out logical fallacies then don't talk about them. 

A strawman is when someone attacks an argument you never made. Like:

""I don't think that ACAB""

""SO....You hate black people?"" <--- this is the strawman. 

""Uh....I never said that.""

Also you're engaging in strawmanning yourself when you say that the bot is automatically discrediting new users. 

It's not. The bot provides information with no editorializing about the user itself. People can just click the profile before the bot an make their own judgements. I do it all the time."
2021-06-22 09:54:59,wallstreetbets,"No, idiot.  It's called a metaphor.

Strawmen, ad hominem...it's like you learned how to talk to humans on the internet and rather than arguing the principle, you resort to acknowledging debate fallacies because that's what you think intelligence is.

Yet somehow you missed ""slippery slopes"", which seems to be the basis of your whole idiotic point."
2021-06-22 10:16:12,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre really fucking retarded
2021-06-22 11:21:36,wallstreetbets,"A poster's history, both on reddit in general and the sub in particular, are relevent to the analysis of their posts.

It's not a logical fallacy to not entrust Bernie Madoff with your money because of what he's done in the past, nor is it illogical to not entrust your 4 year old nephew with your money because she has no experience"
2021-06-22 10:05:06,wallstreetbets,Spoiler: he didn't sell the calls because he doesn't know dick all about shit but wants to be heard.
2021-06-22 11:28:02,wallstreetbets,We're talking to you rofl.
2021-06-22 08:46:09,wallstreetbets,"Okay my bad, used the wrong terminology. Idk why you are getting so triggered here."
2021-06-22 08:46:58,wallstreetbets,"""Everything is a distraction, everybody is a bot"""
2021-06-22 10:19:49,wallstreetbets,"Of course not. He's literally in this thread pushing the idea that GME will follow AMCs recent pattern, which is fud that we've been expecting from shills for months.

Dude's a shill"
2021-06-22 08:00:41,wallstreetbets,As expected demand was up 8% in 2020 and is up so far in 2021. And the billions of solar panels needed to satisfy the green agenda will drive the price higher just like it did in 2019. Nothing like investing in something that has a real use. And my silver mining stocks have doubled.
2021-06-22 09:39:42,wallstreetbets,2021 net loss on assets 6.9% they went public so stupid money would buy the smart money out. Oh its not a new concept the last loser was called pets.com
2021-06-22 19:03:48,wallstreetbets,"You just worded your statement wrong. But no the stock price will not affect the business model in the short term or add to revenue. 

However shares can be sold to add to the any companies cash on hand. Pay off debt, start a venture, etc. 

Simply saying people are retarded when you clearly don't know the basics of investing isn't really an insult."
2021-06-22 10:24:21,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying GME deserves to be this high, but people don't buy a stock because they think the company's good, they buy it because they think the stock will go up, and it tends to because the company is good. In this case, I think the stock will go up, I don't give a shit that it shouldn't have. NOW however, they are in a position to actually create a company worthy of its valuation, no debt, tons of free publicity, a massive following, a bunch of stubborn bastards that won't sell no matter what.

The counter-GME circlejerk is now dumber than the pro-GME circlejerk, but yeah you're clever, you see through the ruse."
2021-06-22 12:57:14,wallstreetbets,"That's the trend.  
Malls are being torn down at record rates, strip malls are following right behind and generally the spaces are being turned into parks or left fallow depending on local land needs. Gamestop is effectively the cornerstone store for tons of strip malls as most national/international brands have left the space. I for one welcome the slow rolling death of retail space."
2021-06-22 13:33:05,wallstreetbets,"LoL.

Your logic needs recalibration.

Correlation =/= causation is a basic logic tenet."
2021-06-22 13:22:03,wallstreetbets,"BWAHAHAHA üòÇ

>In addition, stock market expert Jim Cramer has emphasized in his ""CNBC"" program ""Mad Money"" that the private investors organized through the Reddit sub-forum WallStreetBets continue to watch over their prot√©g√©s. The WallStreetBets members act for idealistic reasons, not because they are convinced of the fundamentals: ""I've never seen anything like this: a group of buyers who don't care about the price,"" said Cramer. The WallStreetBets members simply like the two companies and are ready to do anything to protect them from short sellers.

On those days the short volume was 49.7%, 49.5%, and 49.9%.

So if short volume is consistently over 50%, how is overall short interest dropping? Are short positions being covered in AH/PM?  Any Fintel/Ortex data?

Side Note 1- Short volume is (Short Volume - Short Exempt)/(Daily Volume)

Side Note 2- I know a lot of shares and trades are erroneously reported as long when they should have been reported as short. However the extent of which I have no clue but do assume the reported short volume to be a minimum during normal trading hours."

Hedge fund that bet against GameStop shuts down!  
  
A London-based hedge fund that suffered losses betting against US retailer GameStop during the first meme stock rally in January is shutting its doors. White Square Capital, run by former Paulson & Co trader Florian Kronawitter, told investors that it would shut its main fund and return capital this month after a review of its business model, according to people familiar with the fund and a letter to investors. White Square, which at its peak managed about $440m in assets, had bet against GameStop, say people familiar with its positioning, and suffered double-digit per cent losses in January."

2021-06-22 11:20:19,wallstreetbets,BB was being talked about all the way before even GME took off.  DD was around the same time.
2021-06-22 07:40:27,wallstreetbets,"Everybody waiting out to see if it will pump or dump after earnings probably. Its a high risk play short term, but fine long term.

Also Motley Fool just put out a little hit piece saying that wall street estimates that BB will drop 25% just to make sure retailers don't push the buy button."

2021-06-22 06:04:38,wallstreetbets,Totally expecting wish to be here today.  Where do they pull this info from anyways?
2021-06-22 06:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Except AMC, GME, and BB are top 3 followed by CLOV then CLNE. CLOV has 3rd biggest community so your odds are literally better on CLOV after GME and AMC."
2021-06-22 13:43:38,wallstreetbets,"No it hasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm in on AMC too, but don‚Äôt spread misinformation. If it breaks out of the current pennant pattern it‚Äôs in on the daily, maybe then, but not yet. Daily volume is still tiny. The squeeze will be apparent by huge candles and huge volume. I hope that you‚Äôre right, but I think there‚Äôs danger in getting people‚Äôs hopes up only for it to continue in its current pattern."
2021-06-22 14:20:36,wallstreetbets,They're not even comparable. CLNE is a solid long term hold.
2021-06-22 06:15:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah holding it makes me the least nervous, I prefer it over all."
2021-06-22 07:53:52,wallstreetbets,It recovered multi-day losses in two minutes and pushed it self away from 200 by raising 1.5 billion in cash. That's pretty exciting
2021-06-22 10:03:45,wallstreetbets,It's a long term investment stock so this place already hates it if you cant make a quick buck from it lol

The company as a whole has only been coming out with good news. 

So hopefully earnings are a catalyst for rocketing to the moonskies. That's my take. It truly is being run into the ground, though. The massive red candles at open yesterday show this."
2021-06-22 10:51:51,wallstreetbets,Earnings and they're killing it.. and cyber security should have already flew to the moon so it will any day
2021-06-22 10:54:09,wallstreetbets,Lol earning reports are a great time to buy good stocks
2021-06-22 10:50:31,wallstreetbets,I know!!! But wtf its a great company. Its gotta moon sometime
2021-06-22 14:09:18,wallstreetbets,Then if you have spare money a bit of both.
2021-06-22 12:32:52,wallstreetbets,Same baby same bought at 19 lmao
2021-06-22 12:40:40,wallstreetbets,Hell yea. I was buying as much as I could when it was below $8
2021-06-22 18:30:52,wallstreetbets,Long on BB myself. Seems like a potential killer growth stonk.
2021-06-22 16:51:52,wallstreetbets,21b vs 29b market cap
2021-06-22 18:52:34,wallstreetbets,Just AMC for me ü¶çüí™üèª
2021-06-22 14:59:07,wallstreetbets,"My first call ever, didn‚Äôt know how much it moved"
2021-06-22 15:01:52,wallstreetbets,I still bought back in so I did my part
2021-06-22 13:36:56,wallstreetbets,"rely on it bro, i'm waiting ;)"
2021-06-22 13:15:40,wallstreetbets,Why is this?
2021-06-22 09:17:31,wallstreetbets,Jesus came to me in a dream and said BB is the way
2021-06-22 09:18:21,wallstreetbets,Not a financial advisor so you have to do your own research
2021-06-22 11:36:40,wallstreetbets,Because ü¶çat the controls. üöÄ üçå üåô üíé
2021-06-22 07:48:17,wallstreetbets,LFG
2021-06-22 16:21:30,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs happening. If you want, I‚Äôll scoop you in my brand newish 91 Camry, roll up to your Wife‚Äôs house so you can walk in with the duffle bag full of cash, take off your leather jacket, put your feet up on your coffee table and say ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs home‚Äù while I yell ‚ÄúWOOO, GET EM BOIII‚Äù and honk from the street."
2021-06-22 16:13:12,wallstreetbets,YOOOOOOOO that shit sounds üî•üî•üî•.
2021-06-22 16:14:33,wallstreetbets,You need to be saged and take a hefty dose of essential oils if you think otherwise.
2021-06-22 07:16:32,wallstreetbets,Like Donkey Kong
2021-06-22 08:01:23,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm just hoping to get in good. Wait 15 after market opens or buy at market open?
2021-06-22 08:17:34,wallstreetbets,Did me or anyone else ask? Why so butthurt?
2021-06-22 08:18:51,wallstreetbets,Lmao I love when people come at people for saying what they are saying is dumb as fuck. All I said was your an idiot for spamming anti other tickers on here and you can be banned for spamming that shit. Why don't you say why people should invest in bb instead of just generally providing nothing but an an outing voice yelling bb die everything else
2021-06-22 08:02:47,wallstreetbets,Bro you think it happens over night? Dumb fuck
2021-06-22 08:15:29,wallstreetbets,Yes I still say so
2021-06-22 08:22:08,wallstreetbets,"Nope, I have not. And why are you still writing to me? I don't care of anything you have to say"
2021-06-22 10:50:10,wallstreetbets,"I get that, but it doesn‚Äôt make sense for both AMC and GME to both have the exact same trend lines everyday. They rise and dip at the same time everyday. I know I‚Äôm not the only one noticing and it‚Äôs definitely something fishy. I‚Äôd just love to know the real reason why and how."
2021-06-22 10:56:39,wallstreetbets,Momma ain't raise no bitch! She raised an ape! #memestonKstrong
2021-06-22 10:57:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but it‚Äôs a niiiiice bag"
2021-06-22 09:29:19,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in AMC at 20 shares!
2021-06-22 19:58:08,wallstreetbets,Yah
2021-06-22 17:43:38,wallstreetbets,You make me cringe

2021-06-22 13:11:25,wallstreetbets,Mmmmm BB
2021-06-22 08:08:58,wallstreetbets,no other company could
2021-06-22 10:37:27,wallstreetbets,I hope it follows today so I can sell and buy more GME
2021-06-22 13:11:38,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve learned it unfortunatley. And it sucks dick. But, I know it sucks to hear what I said but like, I hate seeing everyone here loss."
2021-06-22 14:01:50,wallstreetbets,Already made money. My boat left already. Good luck
2021-06-22 14:03:50,wallstreetbets,"You haven't seen what good news does to bb before have you, lemme tell you as a bagholder..."
2021-06-22 14:02:32,wallstreetbets,Lately everything‚Äôs shit the bed after a good earnings report. I‚Äôm out
2021-06-22 07:33:42,wallstreetbets,Based on the ftd cycles?
2021-06-22 06:49:24,wallstreetbets,Echo echo echo chaaaaaaaambaaaa!!
2021-06-22 11:26:31,wallstreetbets,I hope you made some profit
2021-06-22 10:19:50,wallstreetbets,Lol I'm just being real xD these bozos just mad they in a shitty spot
2021-06-22 16:29:04,wallstreetbets,Pan
2021-06-22 17:00:04,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs a dickfore
2021-06-22 10:20:16,wallstreetbets,I'm still holding BB
2021-06-22 08:50:31,wallstreetbets,"Funny I get downvoted, shit I ain‚Äôt saying sell gme lol"
2021-06-22 08:49:45,wallstreetbets,Reddit people
2021-06-22 14:03:13,wallstreetbets,And you expect it to continue because..?
2021-06-22 15:45:31,wallstreetbets,I know; I know!! Don‚Äôt you think I don‚Äôt know what I am doing? Smarty?‚Ä¶
2021-06-22 09:21:32,wallstreetbets,And now you all want to say it today when the stock is up in premarket. You only talk about gme when it's up
2021-06-22 09:22:08,wallstreetbets,When it goes back down everyone is going to be quiet again.
2021-06-22 14:56:11,wallstreetbets,Thanks man‚Ä¶just loading my fridge with Mo√´t ;)
2021-06-22 12:42:27,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-06-22 11:03:33,wallstreetbets,"Okay fair enough, yeah I bought BB right after it hit its high a few weeks ago. I luckily didn't buy at the peak but i've just been watching it get pounded down over the last couple weeks and have been getting a little annoyed with it lol."
2021-06-22 10:54:15,wallstreetbets,sorry sweaty good earnings is actually bad for stonks. I don't make the rules
2021-06-22 10:54:14,wallstreetbets,I got some magic beans that should come good soon if you're interested.
2021-06-22 12:33:19,wallstreetbets,Oh shit. I bought at 16.
2021-06-22 17:13:32,wallstreetbets,"~16 Billion for GME and ~29 billion for AMC, where are you getting your numbers from?"
2021-06-22 13:16:27,wallstreetbets,Earnings and probably positive guidance Thursday after close
2021-06-22 09:19:22,wallstreetbets,Quality DD
2021-06-22 09:19:23,wallstreetbets,Well give me your opinion then as to why you think that  after saying this is not financial advice. Since saying bb can only go up from here is pretty much giving financial advice. I hold 230 shares myself and am trying to decide to hold or not.
2021-06-22 16:26:26,wallstreetbets,Deal babe.
2021-06-22 16:23:22,wallstreetbets,Not sure if trolling or serious lmao. BB is gonna run up but 60 on friday won't happen
2021-06-22 16:15:27,wallstreetbets,I sold bb on 6/2 and you were still trying to hit 15 then too
2021-06-22 08:07:34,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-22 08:05:19,wallstreetbets,Both
2021-06-22 08:23:14,wallstreetbets,Why are you so upset about people calling you out on your dumb ass
2021-06-22 17:50:44,wallstreetbets,Ok ‚ÄúApe‚Äù ur probably super popular and probably have lots of friends
2021-06-22 19:48:36,wallstreetbets,But EH includes pre-market
2021-06-22 16:29:41,wallstreetbets,Peter
2021-06-22 09:14:48,wallstreetbets,There is no we in trading
2021-06-22 08:58:41,wallstreetbets,It's GME AMC and BB not CLNE you retard
2021-06-22 09:22:56,wallstreetbets,Nah we‚Äôre talking about it because they just raised a billion dollars
2021-06-22 10:57:55,wallstreetbets,Can you explain to a fellow crayon-eating apetard?  Logic would suggest a good earnings report would encourage people to buy MOAR shares.
2021-06-22 11:21:12,wallstreetbets,Thats good to know. Im still fairly knew at this
2021-06-22 12:34:10,wallstreetbets,Fellow $16 enjoyer here üòé
2021-06-22 12:42:11,wallstreetbets,"Buy more! Not financial advice but it will certainly lower your average, drive up buy volume, and make your dick bigger."
2021-06-22 13:18:51,wallstreetbets,Couldn't that go badly though?
2021-06-22 09:20:29,wallstreetbets,Unless you're an infidel
2021-06-22 09:27:19,wallstreetbets,"I believe they will beat estimated earnings and outlook on their core products QNX and IVY will be good, which may convince institutional investors that they've made a successful turnaround and that they're currently undervalued by analysts."
2021-06-22 16:25:50,wallstreetbets,Aim high. Even if it hits half that I‚Äôm still getting a MOTHER FUCKING MCCHICKEN WOOO. And making a donation to No Kid Hungry. My 91 Camry dreams can stay on hold.
2021-06-22 16:18:56,wallstreetbets,Wrong. I was attending my 8th grade graduation zoom call on 6/2. And was holding AMC that week.
2021-06-22 08:08:23,wallstreetbets,Lol ass. But ok I‚Äôm on board with GME as soon as I can buy.
2021-06-22 08:23:52,wallstreetbets,Hey everyone this guy's is down a fuck load on bb check him out!
2021-06-22 16:31:28,wallstreetbets,Beter
2021-06-22 12:32:00,wallstreetbets,"Do whatever you want little one, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be on here then, we is equivalent to the Reddit folk"
2021-06-22 09:11:12,wallstreetbets,"Hey little papa, maybe that‚Äôs what some of us have on the side as well"
2021-06-22 11:05:11,wallstreetbets,"thats just the way it works this year with a ton of different stocks. maybe it will be different for BB, but i doubt it..I need to be picked up at $16 myself!"
2021-06-22 12:21:42,wallstreetbets,"My understanding is that the good news is typically priced in before the actual report comes out. That's why people say to buy the rumor, sell the news. By the time the report is released, everyone anticipating good news has already bought in. With everyone already bought in, people sell where they think the peak is and you see a dip after the release. 


Just my understanding though. I could be way off on that."
2021-06-22 12:44:07,wallstreetbets,"I've got a very limited amount of cash to buy and with a big life change this week, I can't go too crazy right now"
2021-06-22 13:20:17,wallstreetbets,"They've been making gains in market share, particularly in AI for the auto industry"
2021-06-22 09:29:24,wallstreetbets,I am suprised that we are not seeing a spike in price before this earnings release. It makes me think that people have already counted them out. If they bomb the earnings do we crash back down to 8$ then? On the flip side this also could be really good Like you said. What was the most their stock was ever worth?
2021-06-22 08:10:49,wallstreetbets,Chad move üöÄ

2021-06-22 11:09:26,wallstreetbets,"My 4k shares averaged at roughly $11 are on our way, brother.  Remain strongK"
2021-06-22 12:45:00,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, spare what ya can afford to lose but hold no matter what!"
2021-06-22 13:23:23,wallstreetbets,But will this be a payout in two years or sooner? I just have more faith in other companies. Seems risky to just let it sit for so long.
2021-06-22 09:38:37,wallstreetbets,"Ever? Over 150, but that was before the iPhone came out.

One of three things will happen: 

1. Prospects are good and they pull an AMD like turnaround and increase;

2. Prospects are alright but no real price effect until eoy when there is more certainty;

3. Prospects are bad and we dump.

Looking at the news about BB I'm betting on scenario 1, possibly 2. But they keep getting roped in with meme stock status which makes people believe that short interest is all that matters now"
2021-06-22 16:34:30,wallstreetbets,Derek Jeter
2021-06-22 12:22:39,wallstreetbets,"Lol ok little papa, go empty your 401k on this, douche"
2021-06-22 11:35:12,wallstreetbets,"Jeezus..4000...you need it to go up to $30..a cool $120,000..Wish i had $44,000 grand to gamble with.. thought i was cool with 200 shares (at $16)"
2021-06-22 13:24:57,wallstreetbets,"Tough to say, it's a casino either way.  Put your money where you feel good about it."
2021-06-22 09:45:07,wallstreetbets,"Let's see what happens then, hopefully we can see a nice spike off like amd. It's sad because bb actually has potential. But idiots like the op refuse to have real conversations like you're having so it scares people away. Doing what we are doing now is how we show people this isn't a meme stock. Going bb will rise for sure is retarded and doesn't do anything. Especially when you're asked why and you go ""do your own research I don't give financial advice"" it's like dude you litterly just said a stock would rise that's giving advice practically moron. Anyway this is the kind of thing we need to do so people can see why bb is a good buy and not just a goodbye."
2021-06-22 12:33:07,wallstreetbets,Already did. Once it hits your mom said she'd let me do anal. Can't wait!
2021-06-22 11:42:44,wallstreetbets,"Thankfully, my fianc√© and I are both doing travel healthcare, so we had some extra money to invest. We‚Äôre bullish on BB‚Äôs future, so I‚Äôm not too worried what it‚Äôs doing in the short-term!  Diamond hands have never been more applicable than with my standing on BB."
2021-06-22 09:54:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah we're gonna see. I know 70% here now doesn't get much further than buying and shilling. I'm quite deep in BB so I'm biased, but im holding because I believe earnings will have a positive effect.

But to be fair I mostly come here to complain when my sizeable position in BB goes down again so that I don't have to keep bitching about it to my girlfriend ü§≠"
2021-06-22 12:34:56,wallstreetbets,"Too slow son, already did that to your mom"
2021-06-22 16:06:55,wallstreetbets,Also I would not suggest pouring your 401k in this casino fyi
2021-06-22 16:11:32,wallstreetbets,Don't worry about me guy. Your mom will take good care of me if the gamble doesn't work out.

2021-06-22 15:21:26,wallstreetbets,"If you're in the top percentile of wealth, or information, or skill, inflation doesn't matter to you. Those with these kind of advantages can keep up with inflation trends, or falling dollar (by shifting assets), or anything. 

The only people who benefit from crazy spending like minimum wage raises, unemployment benefits, low-income benefits, are the poor and lower-middle class. And they only benefit temporarily until the economy catches up.

Whether market goes up or down doesn't matter too much, as long as you are set for a move in either direction with good risk management. Sorry for typing this, should be in r/investing instead of WSB lol."

There is a feature that shows the percent of buying vs selling for a respective coin, for the majority of this pull back since mid may, all of the major coins have been labeled as +60% buying. Maybe the economics behind those percentages  are more advanced than I'm giving credit, but to me if something has a 60/40 buy to sell ratio, it shouldn't be selling off 50%.

&#x200B;

Short $COIN cause their ass is gonna be in the jackpot when they get outed for providing false data to increase buying to increase fees.

Disclaimer: The only explanation is their data is strictly Coinbase transaction and a bulk of the selling is occurring on other  platforms."

Can someone say MASSIVE REGULATION? RIP  


Search them all for yourself. Every time a world leader, even in the USA, try to get away from Central Bank monetary control they end up dead.  


Ghadaffi was in charge for forty years. He was accused of horrible terrorist acts, yet they let him stay in power until he f'd with the currency.

In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I‚Äôll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Jerome Powell. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there."

Some back of the vape packet DD

There have been articles and statements from on Virgin Galactic expansion plans, once they finalise their Delta class spacecraft for manufacturing scalability. 

Mentions so far of additional spaceports so far include: UK, Italy, UAE, Australia, on top of the New Mexico base. 5 sites, and I would imagine we should hear about Asia somewhere - India? Japan?

Without further detailed operational information it seems they could perform 360 flights per year with just 1 mothership and 2 spacecraft. Which is 180 flights per spacecraft per year, which would give a two day operational turnaround. (Don't see why they can't swap out a small motor in that time.)

I believe they can easily scale to operate from 5 or 6 spaceports per year by 2026. Which at a per seat ticket of $600k, would give a revenue roughly equivalent to today's market cap of c$8bn. So about 1:1 P/E ratio in 2026. Given a P/E ratio for growth businesses is usually higher than 10, then we could expect the stock price to rise between now and then to somewhere between c$350-700, just on current strategy assumptions.

Making the current stock price of $38 a bargain for both apes and long term investors! üöÄüöÄüöÄüåöü§ëüçå"

https://preview.redd.it/aimblkpngs671.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=2859c6e25bf9349f4b59f872fd641676b172efc1

Last week was a bloodbath.

100% of my cash is tied up in TELL with the remaining $180k margined into the cruise industry. I am in $TELL for 30,000 shares at a $3.25 avg. I am still bullish on NCLH and CCL for the post-Covid rebound, but with the news last week of a few passengers being diagnosed with Covid and the ships themselves being delayed, there was a major overreaction. We are starting to see a positive outlook for cruise lines this week and I believe we are returning to the norm. With TELL being down last week as well, I was faced with a $22k margin call all of last week. I am still not out of the woods yet, but this week is starting to have a better outlook.

TELL experienced a 10% run yesterday, most would argue that is was due to the recent upgrade in oil and gas. I however, believe that something major is coming down the pipes. TELL is a ""Gold"" sponsor of the 7th China LNG/Gas Exhibition & Summit that is happening in Shanghai 23-25 June.

[https://www.chinalnggas.com/](https://www.chinalnggas.com/)

Martin Houston, the Vice Chairman of Tellurian, is speaking at this event and rumors have been circulating of either an announcement of a partnership with a publicly traded company, or support for China's LNG shortage/demand.

There is also the factor of the short float at **9.35%**.

This is being strongly manipulated. In March of 2020 Tellurian was trading at $8+ with debt outstanding and no deals. Since then, TELL has diluted their number of publicly available shares, but the $24Billion in 10 year deals signed in the past 4 weeks should easily have this trading at or above their pre-Covid numbers.

[TELL Signs 10 yr deal w/Guvnor](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/tellurian-jumps-on-ten-year-deal-to-supply-gunvor?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO)

This is a big week for TELL with this summit.

FID is expected Q-3/4 of 2021 and will easily push this into the $20 range.

In my last post I mentioned a EOM PT of $10 and I think that is entirely possible.

Since not all of us are able to go to the casino we could traget some of our profits towards actual wishes from the critical ill. So the idea is that when WISH blows up we could make alot (or at least a few) of kids really happy and do something meaningfull here. I'm just a small fish but all together we could really make a difference here.  
  
I have no benefits in posting this but I just think the idea behind it could be nice like all the gorillas and endangered species that got adopted  
  
https://www.wish.org/  
\- Every 20 minutes, a child is ‚Äãdiagnosed with a critical illness  
\- Wishes will be granted today because of donors like you  
\- Hope is essential for children with critical illnesses, and you can unlock its life-changing power today. Help make wishes come true.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir Price Discussion Have you been accumulating shares of Palantir as the price has remained stagnant at $25? Where do you see the stock price in 5 years?

I‚Äôve been a long term holder and accumulating shares since November 2020. I speculate we see $40-$50 end of year.

In 5 years I speculate the valuation of the company will be about $500B, which would be a $260 share stock.

I think we need to prove to analysts that we can sustain business from the commercial sector and not just the government sector. I think if we can do this the stock will reach its true value. CEO Karp has hired a big team for Sales, to obtain more commercial business. It might take a month or so before we see results from that."

You decide to go play some roulette at the casino. You call up a taxi. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in luck!‚Äù the taxi driver says. ‚ÄúI just came from there. There‚Äôs a table rigged to always come up black! You‚Äôre gonna be rich!‚Äù You smile and nod.

You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‚ÄòBig Jay‚Äô. ‚ÄúThis is your lucky day.‚Äù he whispers to you as he leans in close. ‚ÄúFor a short time I‚Äôve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you‚Äôll be rich!‚Äù You smile and nod.  
  
‚ÄúRed‚Äù you say with a wink as you lay your cash down and load up on puts again.  
  
You see the confused expression on Big Jay‚Äôs face as he spins the wheel. ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù he calls with a sigh.

2021-06-22 10:08:50,wallstreetbets,"In infinitary combinatorics there is the concept of a reaping family.  A reaping family is a family of infinite subsets of the natural numbers (0,1,2,‚Ä¶) such that for any coloring of the natural numbers with 2 colors, there will always exist a monochromatic set in the family.  

The reaping number tau is the cardinality of the smallest reaping family.  It is strictly larger than the cardinality of the natural numbers, and is thus uncountable, and may be between the cardinality of the naturals and the cardinality of the reals, or if you accept the continuum hypothesis, the same size as the reals.  The continuum hypothesis was proved independent of ZFC set theory, meaning we can‚Äôt prove it right or wrong.  We can add an axiom saying it‚Äôs true or that it‚Äôs false, and the new theory will be consistent if and only if ZFC is consistent."

If he even puts half a turd in the toilet, he has already negotiated himself to:

A movie

Ice cream

One of his big toys

He gets his big yellow truck and gets to sleep with it

Not one of those. All of those.

Plus the stick is there. Each time he poops his pants he loses one of his big toys, and we eat ice cream while he watches. lol"

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Found a way to transfer between bank&robinhood faster. Normally robinhood bank transfers were taking 5-7 days for me.

I tried adding my robinhood bank credentials (routing&account) to apple cash.

It worked.

Bought apple cash with my robinhood debit card instantly.

Transfered my apple cash back to my bank. (0 day ""processing"", 2-3d ""completed transfer"")

Same thing happened with the other way around . (My bank->AppleCash->Robinhood)

Faster when I add money to apple cash from my bank, and then transfering my apple cash to my Robinhood bank credentials. 

&#x200B;

tldr; using apple cash in between 

robinhood->other banks   or    other banks->robinhood 

is faster  than robinhood ""deposit"" or ""transfer to bank"""

You have to be absolutely retarded to short one of the oldest battery companies with the most diversified product portfolio and some of the best tech that are quickly moving into the EV battery segment. On top of that their last report showed high double digit percentage growth YoY.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Good feeling about AMD Recently I've started to be interested in AMD. First of all, I'm not qualified to give any financial advices, I'm just here to share a few facts, that makes me believe AMD could start to rise before July. It reached this week more than 85$ (after Google announced it was working with AMD for Google's Cloud computing which was huge news), and went back to 82,6$ after a dip that hit both AMD and NVDA. 

Here is different articles I found that seem to show that this dip could be an opportunity before a rise : 

https://www.notebookcheck.net/Exynos-with-AMD-mRDNA-2-to-be-unveiled-in-July-peak-performance-better-than-next-gen-Mali-GPU-while-beating-latest-Mali-even-with-30-throttling-Google-signing-up-for-mRDNA-2-as-well.546822.0.html --> it has been public knowledge for sometime now that Samsung and AMD are working on a mobile GPU, but official announcement should be next month, AND, as mentionned in the article, Google could also use AMD's RDN2 tech for something in short term (Google Pixel?). Concerning Google, this is the third time that I see this rumor. 

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amd-no-ec-objection-to-xilinx-merger --> for the moment the acquisition of Xilinx seems to go well 

https://www.neowin.net/news/amds-next-gen-rdna-3-performance-jump-rumored-to-be-absolutely-insane/ --> some good news about 2022's GPU 

I think next earning release is on 07/27/2021 ; we should see good things there. 

There are also the Xbox/PS5 that are a huge success and based on AMD's GPU ; Microsoft and Sony will keep buying tons of AMD's GPU (maybe more than expected originally).

It's my point of view but, to invest in mid-term, it looks good. 

Have fun today!"

2021-06-22 17:20:45,wallstreetbets,The Apple architecture is a highly custom chip. You can't just put it on any Arm device. And even if you get it to work in say an Android phone it's not guaranteed it will work better than a snapdragon. At least not without years of work.
2021-06-22 07:40:32,wallstreetbets,"Well, i'm like 95% sure they used almost exclusively intel's CPUs, but maybe i've missed them using AMD's GPUs, in that case Apple switching from AMD's GPUS might hurt AMD in some part, though without data on a share of GPU chips sold to Apple - hard to tell how big an impact that will be.  
Do you maybe have some insight on what share of GPU and CPU demand for AMD was coming from Apple?"

Generally speaking, it takes time for an unconnected group of people to reach the same conclusion. If there are numerous posts about a stock with positions already secured, it is most likely a pump and dump. Remember that MM secure their positions prior to pumping them and you are most likely the target. If gain porn is posted that generally means that the gains have already happened and you are providing the base for an easy pull out (with my wife's boyfriend knew when to pull out). Do your own DD before jumping into any bandwagon.

Any other red flags to look for?"

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Hedge fund that bet against GameStop is closing down A London-based hedge fund that bet against GameStop is shutting down following double-digit percentage losses suffered during the first meme stock rally in January, according to a report published Tuesday by the the Financial Times citing people familiar with the fund.

White Square Capital, which reportedly managed up to $440 million in assets at its peak, had sent a letter to investors outlining that it would close down the main fund this month and return investor capital following a review of the business model, according to the report. 

Although this marks the first closure of a major hedge fund following surges in these meme stocks, it's certainly not the first to suffer massive losses. The meme stock rally in January saw GameStop stock soar from under $17.25 a share at the start of the year to nearly $400 a share, and at one point gave the beleaguered video game retailer a market cap of roughly $28 billion."

&#x200B;

Isn't the reason Gamestop's  stock was at the price it was was because it was struggling and not adapting to a changing industry?     

This would be like my generation giving Blockbuster a bunch of money because they did not adapt and saw the writing on the wall.  

Why would somebody like Gamestop,( or Blockbuster ) deserve saving? 

If you can bet that a company will perform well in the future, then you can bet that they might perform poorly.      I understand the problem that betting poorly means you may not buy from that company simply because you own stock and don't want the stock to go up in value,   but you still have to go back to why people were betting against that company in the fist place.

&#x200B;

I 'm not going to celebrate people losing money and jobs,   but maybe somebody can open my eyes here?

Gamestop and AMC are just harvesting free money from retail. And deep down inside I hope they take everything from retail and teach them a lesson. This only works if all retail holds but it will only be retail bagholding.

Media knows how much people want to read news like this, but it's just blatant clickbaiting.

2021-06-22 08:59:32,wallstreetbets,"Sure i'll give you some reasons.

Hedge funds manage people's retirements. meaning bankruptcy could fuck with old pops hard earned money. luckly this hedge fund was able to pay back all it's investors. which imo just seems like they are gonna restart a hedge fund under a new name.

People celebrating this particular hedge going down have absolutely 0 knowledge about the company and their holdings. all they see is ""hedge fund"" and ""bankrupt"" and they cheer.

Shorting is a valid strategy and a vital part of the market. it's naked shorting that's a problem but most people that joined in january don't even know the difference between the two.

Also i don't think most people actually read the article? since everyone in here is cheering ""We did it guys!"". No ... no you didn't.

straight from the article about this news:

""Despite the losses, the decision to shut down White Square Capital was unrelated to the meteoric rally of meme stocks""

"" It cited a person close to the fund who said the fund quickly recuperated a ""fair share"" of those losses following January's market volatility. ""

And last but not least. is it even closing down entirely?

""White Square Capital, which reportedly managed up to $440 million in assets at its peak, had sent a letter to investors outlining plans to close down the main fund this month and return investor capital following a review of the business model""

""the main fund"" why would they specify this if they are completely closing down?

Not to ignore that the whole source for this information is ""people familiar with the fund"" which means this all could be BS."

Nothing against rich people. You work hard, take risks, and buy that 8th yacht. Fuck you and congrats. Hell, get that leopard print custom lambo too.  

Win fair, congrats. 

It's because historically they lie, cheat, steal, and fuck  over Joe Schmoe who isn't even playing, minding his own business doing his own thing.

They knowingly sold 100% fraudulent product (CDO's), then bet against that product against their customers. They bet with money they don't have, overleveraging to the extent that thisisAthens' and his family's  hard earned tax payer money was used to pay off their debt and another vacation home for some random Wall Street Exec. They've wiped out ENTIRE LIFESAVINGS of hard working average people who didn't even gamble like us. 

You get caught stealing at a store you're going to jail. They wiped out people's savings they keep their bonuses and don't go to jail. AND THEYRE STILL DOING IT. 

Personally? I played this game and I fucking won back in January-- we all did. But They stopped the fucking game and refused to pay us! 

I WON, but they still refuse to pay me.


So yeah, I'm feeling some type of way."

2021-06-22 07:32:37,wallstreetbets,"Try more like thousands and this one was proverbially nothing.  A few hundred million AUM in private equity is like tee ball to a MLB player.  

And just shorting GME was not the problem.  In normal markers it was probably smart.  The issue were the big players doing fraudulent naked shorts and using insider info to manipulate the price.  Two very different animals.

I'm glad GME is reforming and I've been invested since January and believe they will turn around.  But let's not forget that GameStop, for the last 20+ years, was a terrible business both in execution and in presence.  It was the last place any real gamer wanted to ever go to and when they did it was always an annoying and obnoxious experience. 

Now that they were targeted by short sellers and people have essentially accidentally made millions, collective amnesia is occuring and people act like GME was some gamers mecca when it couldn't have been more the opposite for it's entire existence up until this year."

2021-06-22 07:17:14,wallstreetbets,They short poor performing companies that are either slow or fail to adapt to changing consumer habits. Any idiot could see the writing on the wall for GameStop with the video game market moving to digital. Same thing for AMC and streaming. Hedge funds shorting a company like that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they are likely to go under
2021-06-22 08:23:57,wallstreetbets,Shorting doesn‚Äôt cause companies to collapse. The fact you admit yourself you don‚Äôt understand what they do is hilarious

2021-06-22 09:49:01,wallstreetbets,"Misread your first line. mb

I still stand by what i said. but if you wan't another perspective on it.

The fact they we're able to lose that much money off of shorting GME means they either shorted naked. or they put too much of their capital into one play.

the fact they got burned by it means they (hopefully) learned from what happened and if they decide to stick around they will be more carefull with other people's money.

Better to learn now then to build up the fund to billions of dollars and then get completely wiped out losing many average  joes live savings."

2021-06-22 12:53:51,wallstreetbets,"Sure, it all depends on where you are sitting. For Wall Street this was a boutique fund. My guess is that this was a trial run with a small group of investors. If it posted a large return they'd shop it around for more investor buy in. Otherwise, they close up shop and start over again. This is a way to manipulate a funds performance by cutting out any losing streaks that will drag down the stats."

Ideally, if we can be the catalyst of some sort of just proper regulation I'd be as happy as a duck (you don't see unhappy ducks).  And Blackrock is going to come out of this the monster of monsters. I was fortunate enough that the market crashes I've lived through didn't really affect me and mine that much.

2021-06-22 10:18:21,wallstreetbets,I agree with the unintended consequences that have occured.  But the underlying idea that a bad company could be corrected by the market is not entirely bad.  I don't think anyone is upset about people who shorted Enron or the guys who discovered (and therefore shorted) the housing crisis.  Those are examples of good uses of shorting stocks to fix a market issue.
2021-06-22 09:49:48,wallstreetbets,Incorrect.  Hedge Fund is just a catch all term for private equity firms.

Moreover, the troops that burnt down the White House weren't Canadian. It was a bunch of British regulars imported from the Napoleonic Wars, onward to launch a retaliatory attack against a former colonial territory in the name of King and country. 

Again, for the other Canadians in the back: the White House was burnt by British troops and commanders acting in the interest of British Imperial authority to reclaim British colonial assets."

2021-06-22 10:02:02,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the reference, I didn't know there was an academic difference between them.

As somebody who actually worked in the industry for more than a decade, I can tell you that in the real world the terms are used more or less interchangeably because it's almost impossible to delineate a line between them.  The idea that a hedge fund is focused on short term profits and a PE firm is interested in the long term value of underlying investments is arbitrary.  The reality is that there's almost no company in the industry that falls solely into one of those camps.  There are plenty of hedge funds with long term investments.  Some so long term that they are essentially illiquid.  And anyone that thinks all PE firms avoid short term risk is fooling themselves.  Hence why they are essentially the same thing.  Unless you feel like redefining the definition of a business based on the whims of its fund managers. Today it's a PE, but tomorrow it could be a hedge fund!  

The delineation between something like a hedge fund/PE and a mutual fund is much clearer."

Who cares if they cover their positions, should the market go in the other direction? Be it short or extended market drops, in the end the index always looks better. Even a 61 old dude can hold his investments through an extended recession (and maybe even sell, if it's too prolonged) and still easily live to see his money grow again.

>Many of the troops that fought in the war of 1812 were canadians who had been living there for a while or they were the first nations/metis

Canadian militia units sat on their dicks (e.g., the defensive) until Napoleon got fucked, then the British veterans came over and made the push. Different troops did different things. Canadians didn't burn down the White House.

A fund is whatever they derive the majority of their returns from/ what kind of focus their staff have in finding returns going forward. It‚Äôs fairly easy to tell who is PE and who is HF just from the type of analysts they hire (background/education). Again not sure how you define a majority of cases, I‚Äôve worked in both as a summer analyst and now full time and it was always very clear who is PE and who is HF. They‚Äôre intersecting sets at best.  We‚Äôre talking about PE as an asset class, not the literal definition of the words private and equity. HF cannot be a subset of the PE asset class."

But he is very wrong about people not throwing out money because of corona. For everyone who lost money because of corona there is someone who made money because of corona...and it is a fact that plenty of people did save WAY more money the past two years then they usually did. No holiday expenses, no festivals or other similar activities, no concerts, no weekend trips...and now add the fact that ressources jumped up in prices ranging from 100 to 500% so most people also delayed their building projects."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"(DD) LC - guide to dropping bags and making money Summary:

LC recently acquired Radius bank.  Since then, making it's way to the moon.  This was the **FIRST** FinTech takeover of an actual bank and created the opportunity for real profitability in an otherwise tanking company.  Investors noticed, and they've been getting in on the action for awhile now thinking nobody was gonna notice.  Well I did, and it's time we get our piece of that delicious pie.  At one point this stock closed at 139.50 - so it has a hill to climb to get back to where it was.  Ape nation, it's climbing - are you gonna be on the rocket or on the sidelines watching it BLAST OFF!  So I am gonna say it, and I mean it!  Drop your bags, and start making money!

**Why is it climbing?**

Radius Bank Acquisition

1) LC benefits from the much lower cost of funds (300 basis points reduction).

2) LC avoids the Issuing Bank fees that it was required to pay previously.

3) LC can now generate accrual income at \~10% per annum on LC originated assets that it warehouses on its balance sheet.

**Is this actually a growing business?**

 The first-quarter earnings show us what LC profitability could look like as they move forward.  Now, there is some ""accounting noise"" in the numbers to include timing mismatches between expected credit losses (taken upfront) and revenue recognitions and originations fees (amortized over the life of the loan asset).  The result is that LC appears to be loss-making seen through the GAAP numbers on day 1, whilst increased profitability shines through in later periods. The accounting noise is most pronounced at the ramp-up stage of retaining LC platform assets on the balance sheet. The accounting noise should largely dissipate as the business matures and settles into normalized growth rates.

[Highlights from their Q1 earnings](https://preview.redd.it/oy0xj2aj5q671.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8787a06d94d163a3ed0498c7a6888856c0eaa15)

 As you can see, LC delivered a net loss of \~$47 million. However, approximately $44 million was attributable to notable items (what I refer to as ""accounting noise""), including:

1. Upfronting of provisions for credit losses (""CECL"") due to both day 1 adjustment for the Radius assets acquired as well as newly originated assets.
2. Deferrals of revenue recognition for origination fees.
3. Acquisition-related non-recurring expenses.

Adjusting for these, LC in total is pretty close to being break-even.

I also note that the NII contribution from the newly originated LC platform is quite small and that the LC platform operates on much lower origination levels than pre-pandemic.

To extrapolate future profitability, I 'conveniently' looking to separate LC into two completely ""artificial"" profit centers, being:

1) LC platform assets that are retained on the balance sheet; and

2) Radius bank business plus LC platform assets sold to investors.

And also assume that all costs are attributable to (2). Then on the back of an envelope calculation, (2) is roughly break-even on normalized levels (i.e. pre-pandemic run-rate of originations).

Then the question would be, what is the earnings trajectory of (1)?

[LC Consumer assets deliver an effective interest rate of 14&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/3ikwdjxs5q671.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=cca34cd968251b6022a448544b29695220e65638)

Assuming a 0.28% cost of funds and expected credit losses of \~4%, then all-in return on such assets is going to be close to 10%.

The company is guiding for \~$7 billion of assets in 2021 of which 15% to 25% are to be retained on the balance sheet. Note that normalized originations, based on pre-pandemic levels, should be in the range of $10b+ (Q1 2020 originations were $2.5+ billion).

Putting all these together, in 3 years time, LC could retain as much as $6 billion of LC assets on its balance sheet which could derive close to $600 million of NII. Whilst the rest of the LC bank (Radius and platform assets sold to investors) absorb all the costs (at least in my notional back of the envelope calculation).

The $600 million is further sheltered by LC's tax losses as well.

Now, if my ""back of the envelope"" is correct, then you can choose what multiple you want to apply to that number (8x, 12x, or 20x).

To remind readers, the current market cap is only \~$1.6 billion.

Now, even if you assume a much lower level of assets kept on the balance sheet (say $3 or $4 billion), it seems to me that the margin of safety is rather large.

Also in this analysis, I have not factored in the potential for further monetization of the LC client base (deposits, wealth management, debit cards, buy-now-pay-later products, point of sale lending, etc.).

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Marble EFT Report # Good evening apes!

Sit back and prepare yourselves for the lowest effort DD out there

For those of you who don't know, the marble EFT is the way to pick stocks when you just want to sit back and scratch your nuts. It's a gravitational algorithm where marbles are given ticker names, and what ticker lands twice in the top ten is picked for day trading the next day. Five maps are played each evening and if there are no winners than the day is taken off. **As of April 5th the current overall is 12.33%** 

I made a new graph that you might enjoy more than the old one.

 It still needs a little work, I'd like to add in $SPY but I'm still deciding on how.

""(instructions)""

When playing the marbles an equal amount of money is divided into the stocks that are picked, stocks are bought at open and sold at/before close the same day.

Or don't, I'm not your dad, do what ever you want.

Best of luck to all who wish to partake, and as always..... this isn't financial advice."

Opening Point
Wish is one of the most under appreciated assets in all of commerce. ‚ÄúWish,‚Äù which has almost every unique, weird, and exciting thing to offer. It has a unique feel to it. Similar to Ebay Vs Amazon. Wish allows you to buy UNIQUE items for a discounted price. I think that the product quality, and delivery time will become better for the consumer over the next 12 months based on recent hires, and partnerships. Wish has a decentralized and asset light approach.  Wish is BARELY a household name yet! 

YOU can sell your products in no time on WISH following a general form and business verification.

1)Wish has a data advantage over its piers. 2)Discovery platforms are hard to design. 
3)Wish has over 100M active users. 
4) 70% of sales don‚Äôt involve a search query 
5) 90% of purchases originate from mobile app. 
6) Merchants gain instant access to 100M+ consumers 
7) Wish Local (local brick and mortar stores are pickup locations for wish products. This is part of their asset light approach. 
8) Wish local gaining transaction. It‚Äôs an extra revenue steam for businesses. 
9) Wish product boost helps promote the product. (Similar to Tinder boost, or bumble boosts you horny fucks)
10) Data, and unique user base is why wish is a great acquisition target 

Jackie Reses from Square helped bring Alibaba public, and was part of Square before they even went public! She is regularly on CNBC, & ARK Invests on YouTube. She is going to possibly provide financial services to the underbanked and the merchants they serve .She is possibly the KEY üåü

Notable Owners

Peter Thiel owns over 1B in $Wish shares. He is co-founder of PayPal, Palantir, and Founders Fund where he was the first outside investor in Facebook. 

The Downside 
Wish relies on 90% of its sellers coming from China. This becomes a logistical nightmare. Long delivery times and product quality give Wish consumers headaches. 

Closing thoughts. POTENTIAL
IF they address these issues AND diversify the countries their sellers are from (Latin America, Africa, Europe, USA) etc this company looks like it has ALL the potential in the world. It could potentially allow you to sell to the American consumer while being from any country in the world."

The thing that scares me most about WISH is that they are hemorrhaging money. At current loss rates they have about 2 years to start turning a profit because their TTM loss from operations is $700M.

2 years is a long time. Hopefully they'll position themselves to turn a profit by then but for now I'm just riding my calls for the short term."

I might buy into it. But this is a quick pump and dump. Not something to hold for years and expect to beat the market with.

You think the product matters? No, the mementum matters. The difference is that this is a stock that wouldn't go down much even without the momentum, it was stable at $X and then stable at $XX after the major addition of vendors.

Compare WISH to the other meme stock. You don't need to compare it to any other stock right now, because at this point WSB is betting on the next meme and not the next fuckin Tesla or Apple. The pump stocks are fun and it's a game if it's own!

It was so fucking safe at $11 that there was no reason for a stop loss. You'd need to be full ape not to buy it when it was $11, and now it's extremely bullish regardless of whether you believe in the company or not.. so it's still a good pick at $13+."
2021-06-22 02:36:25,wallstreetbets,"Pump and dumps are explicitly banned on here for a reason. Not that it hasn't become explicitly obvious to everyone that that's the new normal.

2021-06-22 02:43:53,wallstreetbets,"Because there's nothing else exciting right now. I sort by new all day and all the DD coming out right now is an absolute snoozefest. So, if there's literally nothing else to invest in except WISH, then it's not a pump and dump because there's nothing to switch to if we dump.

Once there's something better, then we switch. That's how it always was even if people liked to post gains porn of diamond hands when other people bailed too early.

So, if you're saying that we'll switch as soon as something better comes up.. yes, but if that makes it a pump and dump then literally everything in WSB is a P&D."

$AMD has been mentioned here again after a few years of dormancy. Thats legitimate company with a ton of upside potential. 

So does $CLNE. It's a natural gas company that provides clean energy solutions for long-haul trucking.

Or what about $SOFI? It's an alternative to Robinhood a lot of people seem to like.

That's the thing, tho. We could get into actual undervalued companies that aren't just pump and dumps. 

So what's the point of these? I remember when this sub piled into Tesla and AMD. I saw those stocks take off and they're still doing well. No bullshit required."

2021-06-22 02:54:45,wallstreetbets,"That's exactly what I'm saying man, to me WISH is a legitimate company compared to those. A business with no debt, tons of money to invest in themselves, tons of new vendors, new upper staff, and new shipping centers to support it all. It's a company worth betting on way more for me than a movie theater, energy sector is too unstable for me, or yet another broker."
2021-06-22 02:59:53,wallstreetbets,"I haven't looked at recent options so I'm just taking a shot in the dark.. but, if there are a lot of other calls I think it's probably fairly safe for tomorrow to go up. Or it goes down.. I like to make excited claims that it's going to hit $17 then $24 etc but in reality, it could go down too. I was super confident buying at $11 and I do think it has momentum still for the next few days.. I'd go for it, but that's just me, don't take my advice!"
2021-06-22 02:57:29,wallstreetbets,What's your exit strategy? Sell in a couple days and buy back in?
2021-06-22 03:03:22,wallstreetbets,"Well, IV crush could be a reality with this one too. I guess that's the risk when buying memes. But I just took a look at the options chain and they look pretty cheap. Worst case scenario is I'm out a small amount of money.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AMD Merger Incoming -- Breakout Catalyst (3-4 weeks away) Hello everyone,

I believe that $AMD is on the verge of experiencing a catalyst that will push the stock to a new ATH. As many of us know $AMD has been trading sideways and down for the past year (with some noise) since last October. I feel fairly certain that that is about to change.

Last October $AMD announced a merger with $XLNX. The two giant companies have been working it out since that time. Recently, both companies share holders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger.

To summarize what this merger means to $AMD we're talking about increased revenue, increased profit margin, better synergy and heading towards better products. The number 1 thing $AMD is going to get out of this? A better shot at taking down $INTC for the cloud market. A company with a market cap of roughly 225 billion compared to $AMD's 100 billion. So this is a David vs Goliath moment.

There's plenty of articles written out there on how this changes the financials and prospects for $AMD but I know you guys aren't going to read it if I re-write it here. To put it simply: This is a big deal. If you felt bad about missing $NVDA's stocksplit run, this is the potential chance of catching the 'next' big chip manf. movement.

So why am I writing this now instead of last October? Well, it's because things changed last week. We know who the customer is now: $GOOG.

That's right. A 1.67T company is tapping $AMD over intel to help support their cloud.

Proof: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm\_source=yahoo-host&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)

So we know they picked up $XLNX. Now we know they are teeing up for $GOOG. This is freaking huge. Not to mention they also acquired business from $TSLA, another 600B+ company.

Proof: [https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/](https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/)

So, let's list them out...

Catalysts:

1. $XLNX Merger
2. $TSLA contract
3. $GOOG partnership

This is clearly a big picture strategy on $AMD's part to push $INTC's weakening cloud business straight into the grave and take it's spot. I believe if $AMD is succcessful they will eventually reach a valuation closer to 200-300 billion dollars within the next 1-2 years. That's a 200-300$ share price.

So what am I suggesting?

&#x200B;

1. I believe that post merger the fair value of $AMD is closer to 120-160 a share
2. Without the merger $AMD has a value of about 120 a share(due to new contracts and overall market conditions. Just look at $NVDA's recent 50% run. Staying neck to neck as a competitor puts them at 120. But they have new business to justify it instead of black magic stock splits)

Is there TA to support this? You bet there is. I use 2D time frames to wash out noise. I made some small crayon circles to give the picture some scope. You can use a 1W time frame and the analysis is the same. The stock's slow moving averages have begun to move higher and are approaching a cross, moving the stock towards positive. In simple terms: Gaining share value on average, every 2 days. And that rate is growing. The OBV is increasing meaning that **someone** 'aka Wall Street' is secretly scooping up shares and holding onto them. They are doing all of this while keeping the stock suppressed well below it's ATH. I believe they are intentionally gathering as much as they can before the catalysts combine and create a giant bull run. This is a long term run that could make a lot of people rich. The moment when $AMD sprints after $INTC and $NVDA. We all know as gamers and redditors that $AMD has become much much stronger and better in recent years. It's been amazing to watch their progress.

&#x200B;

[$AMD 2D time Frame](https://preview.redd.it/ueoex1s30q671.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cae96daec77945f519f2c1a112456ec06399e2b3)

&#x200B;

Here on the 1 week you can see the faintest flicker of bullish life. This is due to the recent contract developments and the quickly approaching date of the merger. As I wrote above, **the catalyst is incoming**.

[1 week time frame](https://preview.redd.it/9f80a7ur0q671.jpg?width=2440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31722579984b09e8fa30bcf913e22b2d41a96c5c)

So. When is the merger? I am sure you want some dates and some juicy possible plays. Here you go...

We've got 3 approvals that have to happen.

1. EU - Believed to have no problems and will probably be approved end of June, end of July at the latest.
2. UK - July 6th Deadline. Also rumored to have 0 problems
3. CCP - This one there's no rumored date, but CCP supposedly has no issues as well.

Where can you verify these dates? I encourage you to google it. There is a SA article with them written down, but due to WSB rules I cannot post the link here. I highly suggest googling that data before you enter the trade.

What is Wall Street doing? They are both shorting the stock while sweeping July calls as well as 2 year leaps. Take a look at July:

&#x200B;

You've got 19498 calls purchased for July 16th at a 90$ strike. That sure sounds like Wall Street betting on it hitting 90$... after something happens. But we know what that is. It's the merger.

[Unusual Option Chain July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/s3ez29jl2q671.jpg?width=942&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae8892e1f6a9a53eef3d2dc7a56f57c5a60926be)

How is this unusual? Take a look at the week prior:

&#x200B;

[You could sum this up and it's barely even the volume for the 90$ strike on July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/53uatc9r2q671.jpg?width=944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42bc7cd9650553fe2f3f34107f10c29c8a5e7ad6)

So how to interpret this? Well, I read this as Wall Street ***knowing*** what's about to happen. I believe they know the status of the merger, and approximately how far it's going to take the stock. I believe we're looking at $AMD pushing above 90$ by Mid July. This is a potential 10 bagger. Especially with them trying to push down $AMD's price today, now is a good opportunity to get in.

So what's the play? The easiest one is the 7/16/21 90$ strike. Go alongside wall Street and when you're happy with the profit--sell it. The merger could be announced any day so buying to at least that date is wise (IMO -- but I am just a degenerate not a financial expert).

Buying longer could potentially let you capture more of the run if things play out the way I think it will. You could also take advantage of the current low to grab leaps and sit back and watch how this story unfolds over the next 2 years. Either way, there's real potential here in something most people are considering dead in the water.

I am currently holding 119 contracts. A large portion are for the 7/16/21 90$. So yes, my money is on this play and continues to be what I pursue. This is my YOLO.

&#x200B;

My recommendations: Buy shares, Buy calls for mid july. Buy leaps. If you buy shares wait for the catalyst to occur. When it reaches an apex, start selling $CCs because the IV is going to grow.

As a disclaimer, I am not a financial expert. I am just a retail stock trader. I love to do TA as a hobby. I truly believe that $AMD is being suppressed as Wall Street 'fattens' their positions. You know what I say? Fuck 'em. They think they are hiding what they are doing but I definitely see it. They are preparing and we can too. And, if we're right, we can make more than them.

&#x200B;

Best of luck out there. I hope you enjoyed my DD. I don't post DD often on WSB, but I hope y'all enjoyed the read. You guys are great and I love you all.

As a disclaimer. I don't take responsibility for anyone's gains and losses. While I am in this and have put my own money on it, I do not promise 100% sure success. Only my own idea of what will happen.

My position screenshot is below. I do edit out my current value and cost basis. I hope you don't mind but I am a relatively private person. My positions are not for everyone. I change them dynamically depending on how the stock is moving between dates. Please do not use my own as a template for yours.

2021-06-21 22:04:44,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm heavy into AMD, I think it will have a similar run up as Nvidia, and the great part is it‚Äôs not even overextended like Nvda is. 50 calls 7/30/21 @ $82.50c, and 20 calls 8/20/21 @ $80c"
2021-06-21 23:58:00,wallstreetbets,"I've been eyeing up $AMD for awhile now. Somehow this stock still hasn't flown off the shelves despite having the best processors on the consumer market, bar none. And this is coming from a guy with an Intel rig. $NVDA meanwhile has done nothing but fly. This is a twofer.

Their leadership under Dr. Su is amazing, and now we have all of this tasty good news.

Gonna have to save up for some LEAPS calls here. This is too promising to pass up.

Those July strikes and expiry are really aggressive, however. I think that's a hard sell. LEAPS only for me."
2021-06-21 23:20:22,wallstreetbets,"07/16 is a monthly, 07/09 a weekly. This difference may explain some of the open interest disparity."

2021-06-22 01:39:42,wallstreetbets,Dude I‚Äôm extremely bullish on AMD as well but you gotta buy farther out calls my man.
2021-06-21 22:24:10,wallstreetbets,AMD ? I‚Äôm in . Only thing I see holding back the tendies is NVDIA. We all know about stocks dropping hard after they split so my only thing to keep on eye on is Nvidia. I want to see them get clapped before grabbing these AMD calls.
2021-06-21 23:09:17,wallstreetbets,$10k in calls opening tomorrow at $83 IV is dumb low

2021-06-21 22:18:09,wallstreetbets,Got a august contract for this baby ‚ù§Ô∏è
2021-06-22 02:15:22,wallstreetbets,"That's fantastic TA bro! Lemmy back you up a little here. 

On 6/9/2021 1.5mil shares were traded at $80.07 in one transaction.  This could be buying, or selling.  unknown.  But, since we're above that $80 level, it could be buying.  

on 6/7/2021 1 mil shares were traded @ $81.41. We're above those levels, so, could be buying.

on 6/2/2021 1mil @ $81.71.  We're above those levels, so, could be buying.  

on 5/21/2021 1.07mil shares were traded $77.20. Again, we're above so, could be buying. 

Now, you can trace 1mil shares traded in a single shot all the way back to 3/9/2021 ranging from $73.96 all the way up to the most recent large trade @ $81.71 that happened on 6/7/2021. 

You have to go all the way back to 2/18/2021 to find a 1mil trade that was done at a higher price than where we're at now.  So, Wall Street may have been accumulating 25+ mil shares of this stock. Since we haven't really seen any new large trades in a few weeks, they may have fully entered their position and, like you said, are waiting for the catalyst to move it up.   


Happy trading, bro and best of luck!"

Samsung and AMD are working on an Exynos mobile chip with ray tracing - TheVerge, June 1 2021

AFAIK, this is the 1st time AMD is working on any CPU/GPU related to mobile phones/devices. And you know how big mobile gaming is (Hello COD Mobile, PUBG Mobile and Fortnite). Nvidia has the Tegra Chip (found in Nintendo Switch and Tesla Model S vehicles). I‚Äôm seriously awaiting AMD‚Äôs answer with RDNA technology. Potentials are limitless.

2021-06-22 08:27:03,wallstreetbets,"I'm late to the party, but this post reeks of confirmation bias.  
Let's ignore the fact that semiconductors have been underperforming recently and AMD's chart is not great looking.   
**RED FLAGS**  

- You quote a market cap of 200-300B in 1-2 years, which is doubling their market price and equating or surpassing INTC's market cap (~225B), on a merge that would bring the combined entities **total revenue** to something like 12-13B annually, compared to INTC's **77B** annual revenue. These numbers don't add up _at all_.  
- SA article quoted  
- Your time frames are really specific; first off the merge is expected to happen by _year end_, and second you're looking at charts no longer than a week in time.  
- You fail to understand that while ~19k in option volume is a lot, for AMD it's par for the course and what you saw there was probably a shift in position from one expiration, the June monthlies, to the July monthlies and is by no means an indication ""that someone on the street knows something"".    

 I've a high level of confidence this trade will fail"
2021-06-21 22:22:34,wallstreetbets,"1. Nvda is not a merger play, it's a stock split play as arm merger is not approved and I would bet it's not due to fang 2. Chinese regulators apparently take a year to investigate?"

I have 25 k in shares avrg 70 and 10k in call 100$ strikes jan 2023 , wouldnt be surpise this stock push past 200 $ before they expire, very safe play , you never loose with AMD and when it pop , IT POP!!!!!

2021-06-22 01:12:15,wallstreetbets,"You are failing to realize a few key bear considerations for AMD: 

-Every major software company is starting to look at bringing chip design in house in the same way that apple launched the M1 and left intel left to out to dry. Amazon‚Äôs AWS for example doesn‚Äôt want to pay AMD a heavy margin for their slightly modified general purpose ARM design that Amazon could do better/cheaper for their instances. It‚Äôs public knowledge that they are building their own chips to use for AWS services. Microsoft doesn‚Äôt want to use the power hungry and inefficient chips of yore either on Azure or the devices they are selling- you could even imagine them eventually bundling windows and windows chips to OEMs for a discount. 

-The Tesla deal is garbage. AMD sells more chips from Xbox sales in a day than they will sell in a year on premium Tesla models (S+X).

-The real winners (other than big tech SW companies) are ASML (semi manufacturing devices used by intel, and TSMC among others) and NVDA (I believe that the ARM deal will go through). If the ARM deal goes through, every major player in the tech space will need to pay out licensing fees to NVDA if they are not using NVDA chips. That combined with SW development ecosystem NVDA offers makes it pretty compelling IMO."

2021-06-22 07:52:26,wallstreetbets,Def looking for a safe bet until i can get in on the ground floor on the next great ape.  I had heard about GME for the first big run.  I wish I had dove in for the second great GME run.  It wasnt until my brother said he bought $8 per share of AMC that got me paying attention but he didnt tell me about it until it was at $25 at which he told me its not too late to jump in.  He was right.  I dont think its too late now to make some money on AMC and I do think itll rocket but certainly greater risk for a not as big payout as if i bought at 8-25$ a share.  Im gonna watch the price of AMD next few days to see if it goes any lower.  Thanks for this post.

2021-06-21 22:35:01,wallstreetbets,Best of luck friend. I hope it works out for both of us.
2021-06-21 22:07:48,wallstreetbets,There's a merger approval coming within the next 3-4 weeks. It'll push the stock price up.
2021-06-21 23:05:31,wallstreetbets,Ha. I didn't even notice. That makes it cute.
2021-06-22 08:48:35,wallstreetbets,Do it on open then resell to the retards here. Profit.
2021-06-22 11:14:52,wallstreetbets,I am aware of this one but not super familiar with it so I didn't include it. Thank you for educating me on it
2021-06-21 23:41:40,wallstreetbets,For my privacy. I don't want people to know how much money I have.
2021-06-22 08:49:59,wallstreetbets,Lol there isn't a short position behind every rock you fucking retard.
2021-06-21 22:07:11,wallstreetbets,I'll post it now.
2021-06-21 22:13:07,wallstreetbets,Screenshot is uploaded.
2021-06-21 23:32:19,wallstreetbets,Same take away I had but I think china is likely
2021-06-21 23:52:41,wallstreetbets,You're welcome. I hope I am right. Writing it out helped my thinking
2021-06-22 09:48:58,wallstreetbets,Shares are always great. Just do what you are comfortable and play with. It isn't risk free
2021-06-22 11:08:30,wallstreetbets,I liked the pricing of AMD options better and $AMD is described as the ones owning most of the xlnx shares moving forward
2021-06-22 09:07:27,wallstreetbets,Nah he's trying to pump it so the other suckered buys his calls he needs to close out ad he loses money. That's all WSB DD is... confirmation bias to sell to the next sucker in line. This is all garbage
2021-06-22 18:40:39,wallstreetbets,Amd earnings expected to grow 50 percent this uesr
2021-06-21 22:26:58,wallstreetbets,I am aware. I described it as black magic stock split
2021-06-22 00:54:51,wallstreetbets,hey how i take this thing off under my name ? i dont know what the hell is that
2021-06-22 02:31:54,wallstreetbets,Great question. I believe the market is aware and that's why the on balance volume is increasing as they acquired shares. Now why hasn't the prices moved with it? Shorts is the only explanation I have.
2021-06-22 09:07:53,wallstreetbets,Lol OP thanks you once he dumps those calls on you. Nothing is happening in july.
2021-06-22 13:32:28,wallstreetbets,"Well, I guess it depends on what kind of risk you're okay with. It's possible $AMD goes down to 50$ a share some day and you'll lose half of your 100$ or so. If you're okay with that, then you can. It isn't going to make your 100$ into 1000$ if that's what you're looking for unless you buy the right option at the right moment. If you buy a share I think you could get 20-50$ in a year or so"
2021-06-22 03:01:02,wallstreetbets,Wow. I was bullish on AMD hard but your views are indeed spot on. What about the AMD Xilinx Merger??
2021-06-22 05:01:25,wallstreetbets,"Licensing fees are a pittance compared to NVidia revenues. They are not looking to reap huge profits from licensing revenues, they're looking to foster a monopoly situation. Simply licensing ARM isn't good enough for them, as they can't lock out competitors this way.

Impossible to pick winners at this early stage (and there might not be a clear winner, which is the best outcome for consumers). I think much of it will come down to whether an unholy alliance forms between Intel and AMD on the open source software front. NVidia closed ecosystem cannot hope to compete with a competent open source alternative."
2021-06-22 01:43:21,wallstreetbets,Those are solid points. I do stand by my DD however. But I understand what you're describing. I just interpret some things differently. Best of luck my friend
2021-06-22 07:13:54,wallstreetbets,"Not sure this is the correct take on AMD.

-You are underestimating the costs and software investment necessary to develop a competitive piece of ARM silicon, AMZN, Appl and Samsung have the scale to support their own chips, but few others. For cloud, Amd and google are able to offer better perf/$ than AWS with their new T2D instances as OP mentioned. Microsoft seem to like AMD's SEV feature that they use in their Confidential VM's. The shift to custom silicon was driven by Intel stagnation, with AMD executing on TSMC's leading nodes this trend may slow or reverse.

-This reinforces the first point, if custom Silicon with strong software was easy Tesla would have rolled their own. Another win for AMD's Semi-custom business on TSMC silicon. Sony and Msft sell millions of consoles, but choose to leverage modern AMD silicon and the x86 ecosystem.

-NVDA/ARM merger is not a certainty, UK consider it strategic and ARM china is in open rebellion. Nvdia openly state they plan to make their own ARM server chips, taking away ARM's independence and fueling RISC-V competition."
2021-06-22 00:31:03,wallstreetbets,Fair enough! Gotta go with what you feel is right
2021-06-22 03:18:31,wallstreetbets,Can you explain
2021-06-21 23:38:58,wallstreetbets,I have! Compare others if you want.
2021-06-22 02:20:15,wallstreetbets,"wrong, 7% short interest"
2021-06-22 09:05:32,wallstreetbets,Lol if you're going to buy based on this shit thread...

2021-06-22 00:19:30,wallstreetbets,Aggressive? Those are already ITM. He's hoping those become far ITM and make a nice chunk.
2021-06-22 03:14:55,wallstreetbets,Really long dated call options. Like several months to years out. Typically in the money or at the money.
2021-06-22 01:39:29,wallstreetbets,bc they don‚Äôt open up the weeklies until a few weeks before. Investors and institutions had months to buy monthlies
2021-06-22 01:34:08,wallstreetbets,Lmao reddit doesn't have enough money to pump and dump AMD. Only whales can do that
2021-06-22 01:01:25,wallstreetbets,"You really think a wsb post can trigger pump and dump of a $100 billion market cap company? This ain‚Äôt CLOV, CLNE, WISH etc"

2021-06-22 11:08:18,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs arbitrage in the xlnx merger that includes shorting amd. Be informed before you sling out insults
2021-06-21 22:16:09,wallstreetbets,Lol no wonder you think it's gonna happen soon. I'm high on AMD too but I don't know about 3 to 4 weeks.
2021-06-22 08:57:13,wallstreetbets,"> Writing it out helped my thinking

Translation: ""helped my confirmation bias and hopefully helped foster volume to justify my soon expiring options that I'm losing money on.""

Which is what WSB DD is about any more. Nothing you listed is remotely substantiative. Not a bad company to go long on, in general. But gotta inject hopium to get the retail crowd pumping and dumping"
2021-06-22 13:27:55,wallstreetbets,"Not risk free of course. I just have a serious hard time seing AMD dropping stock price in the long term.... But yeah, who knows."
2021-06-22 12:21:17,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. I dont know about the options. But stocks only XLNX is a better bet if you think merger breezes through because you get paid the risk premium of the merger failing.
2021-06-22 02:10:55,wallstreetbets,LOL
2021-06-22 13:40:35,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, that's what I wanted to know. Son not really worth for me , the 100->1000 was more what I was searching for. And one more question out of curiosity. If I happened to buy a GameStop share when all the shit was going down (that's how learned about this sub) how much would I have made (approximately if I had sold at almost the peak)?"
2021-06-22 08:50:28,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs definitely a positive. I would argue that Xilinx has limited growth ahead though‚Ä¶FPGAs are an expensive tech to manufacture compared to ASICs. As it gets easier and easier to build and manufacture ASICs (with the help of a Fab), there‚Äôs less of a need for some of their customers to go with FPGAs. I don‚Äôt see them going away ever, but I‚Äôm just not sure what sort of growth has been modeled in already into their valuation. I‚Äôm also not too sure if there is any real synergy with AMD- to me, it mainly seems like another diversified revenue stream."
2021-06-22 08:41:16,wallstreetbets,"I am rooting for your calls, I don‚Äôt currently have any position (bearish or otherwise) so would not be mad if Lisa Su made your dreams come true."
2021-06-22 08:39:01,wallstreetbets,"I recognize that the costs of chip design are crazy, but it turns out that AMD‚Äôs biggest customers are also the most competent and well endowed. We have already slowly started to see this with ML accelerators in the cloud. Sure, Microsoft, Google, Amazon may like a specific chip feature from AMD, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt have a long term roadmap to replace with their own chips. I would suggest reading about Amazon Graviton, if you don‚Äôt think the big guys are gunning to replace the intel/AMD.

-Tesla premium models are exceptionally low volumes. Even Tesla as a whole doesn‚Äôt build enough cars to justify building their own general purpose compute and graphics chips yet- as you said, it‚Äôs very expensive. Tesla already did build their own silicon for autopilot inference- I don‚Äôt believe full self driving will ever work with their current sensor suite, but that‚Äôs a totally separate problem.

-I agree, it‚Äôs not a certainty and there is risk of other architectures replacing ARM in the industry, but I‚Äôm not super optimistic that will happen for a long time. I would still argue it‚Äôs definitely a bearish concern for AMD."

2021-06-22 09:55:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah... I seriously doubt we can move a huge company like this. This is just an idea
2021-06-22 09:14:58,wallstreetbets,It would be a wise choice to rotate back into AMD
2021-06-22 14:33:23,wallstreetbets,i have decided to stay in NVDA until the shares split at least. i decided to buy these shares instead of an RTX 3090 and do not regret that at all
2021-06-21 22:25:48,wallstreetbets,Yes. So there's a seeking alpha article that was written today for instance with all of the dates laid out. However wsb rules prohibit linking to them. I highly recommend googling it yourself.
2021-06-21 23:42:49,wallstreetbets,"Which is why I usually don't post DD. You're welcome to remove my post if that's an issue. Just trying to share an idea

Yeah, true. Good point about the math"
2021-06-21 22:17:14,wallstreetbets,The merger dates for approval are pretty much set. I believe it's on the paperwork. The option chain I believe is evidence of wallstreets thinking regarding it.

2021-06-22 13:42:47,wallstreetbets,"You can look on charts and always find a spot where you 'could have' gotten 5x 10x and 20x your money. That's what everyone wants. It's exceptionally rare and hard to predict.

$gme had a short interest of over 100% which was insane. Nothing else in the market does. 

You're going to have to do what Cathie Wood is trying to do. You need to find the next Tesla, Apple, or Netflix. 

But all of wall street is trying to do that too.

Good luck."
2021-06-22 09:38:57,wallstreetbets,"Mega caps always gonna be tempted to vertically integrate, Amd and indeed Nvidia's goal with these is to out pace development to keep their edge. The T2D press materials don't name Graviton, but it shows the new competitive landscape. 

The google/tsla deals shows with competitive perf/w, x86 remains an appealing platform. 

Ip rev is generally low, softbank want rid of ARM for a few reasons, low rev growth being one of them. I agree tho, the market loves the deal, so Amd bearish."
2021-06-22 09:52:46,wallstreetbets,I admit I can be wrong. No one should take a trade they aren't comfortable with. This is what I am doing and I am sharing it. I'll probably lose my money with my luck. You gotta do you

2021-06-22 09:54:59,wallstreetbets,August is a good contract!
2021-06-21 22:34:22,wallstreetbets,Sure! So I am bias so take what I say and make your own decision. I believe the critical decision is not china. I believe it's the UK and EU. Once that ball starts to roll it will go through. Once the news breaks of UK and EU approval I believe the stock will move. My thinking is that Wallstreet is 'calling it' for July 16th based on the options chain. I believe they have the info you and I lack
2021-06-22 00:03:16,wallstreetbets,yeah China is a total wildcard imo and can fuck up this entire short term play
2021-06-22 01:50:08,wallstreetbets,They are there. One is written one is given as end of month
2021-06-21 22:28:01,wallstreetbets,"I hope so too. I do believe we will get the first approval nod by EOM. Regardless, with the market bouncing 7/9 isn't a bad date. Just higher risk exposure."
2021-06-21 22:35:56,wallstreetbets,Bold assessment my man ! Gonna do some more looking into it and see where the 7/30 85c land in the morning ! Best of luck !
2021-06-21 23:45:48,wallstreetbets,I have most of my calls expire July 16th...  bought after last Er... I really hope you are right!
2021-06-22 00:05:05,wallstreetbets,It absolutely can. It's not risk free. But I would say no trade is.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tagging along when $ET goes home. A DD about the stock‚Äôs price‚Äôs influences Good morning smooth brains. In order to make u/zjz happy I‚Äôve written this DD on something other than wish. The following isn‚Äôt financial advise I just like the smell of oil. Writing this from my phone so please mind the formatting

Oil (WTI) has hit a new post-pandemic record, let‚Äôs capitalize

Transparency: 

My oil positions: 

$ET Calls 

$CVE (TSX) Calls

$XOM Calls

Microcap Canadian natural gas stocks 

$ET Implied volatility at time of writing: 38.64%

For comparison: $Wish‚Äôs Implied volatility: 174.9%

What is Energy Transfers LP?

Energy Transfers LP owns/maintains/builds pipelines that transport natural gas and propane (sadly they don‚Äôt transport propane accessories)

Stock Pricing:

The Price of $ET can be chalked up to 3 important factors 

1. Price of WTI (Western Texas intermediate/Price of oil) because of its ownership of Suneco

2. Price of AECO (Alberta energy company monthly index/price of natural gas) because it transports natural gas

3. Political Aspects like status of pipeline projects (Politics/Public relations) because of its pipeline ownership 


PRICE OF WTI

The price of WTI tanked because of the pandemic. The last time it was $72  Sept 2018

The Price of the stock Sept 2018 was roughly 17.50

Now that OPEC+ has gotten it‚Äôs shit together, WTI has been climbing with price estimates of 100+

Price of AECO

The price of AECO (natural gas) also tanked because of the pandemic. The last time it was 2.5 USD/MMBTu was when it AECO crashed back in 2015. The stock price fell from $30 to $9 due to the sink. AECO is forecasted to increase in the coming years 



Political Aspects:

Rick Perry is on the board of directors, his hands in politics and good standing with both Democrats and Republicans 

Judge James Boasberg has allowed the Dakota Pipeline to continue during environmental review. $ET has 36.4% interest in the Dakota Pipeline

What‚Äôs important to note is if new pipelines are not being approved, which is likely with the Biden administration, that those companies that OWN the current pipelines will have the market majority of transportation. The rest will have to use more costly methods such as rail

Texas had an energy crisis earlier in February that net $ET 2.4 B.
Texas is AGAIN having an energy crisis this summer and $ET is set to gain again



With a stock price of 11.01 and consistent analyst (non smooth brain) rating of buy this stock is going nowhere but up

Average volume is 16.0M with shares outstanding of 2.7B. In the last 12 months there have been 20 insider buys and 6 insider sales. 0 in the last 3 months"

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How to analyze BB QNX backlog from 195 million cars Seems like everyone is confused about how the BB QNX $490 mil backlog is calculated from that BIG BB announcement today. 

[big Blackberry announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-120000793.html)

So basically in the COVID hit car industry and chip shortage industry where car companies shipped less cars, **Blackberry QNX managed to ship in 20,000,000 cars**!!! Thats huge!! now in 195mil cars.

The backlog increased from **$450million to $490** million. This doesn't mean that 20 million cars shipped last year only generated $40million. The 20 million cars shipped last year were part of the $450 million backlog they announced last year in JUNE. The $40 mil new backlog added to last year number is **NOT THE TRUE BACKLOG growth!!!** 

**What does this mean!!!???**  
Assuming each car now generates $10 for QNX. Those 20 million cars generated $200 million revenue for QNX last year. Here you can see it included somewhat in their financial release for last year [Software Service Rev](https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/2021/q4y2021/supplemental-financial-information-q4fy21.pdf) **. On face it looks like QNX backlog revenue only creased by $40mil this year but that's not a true picture. The TRUE BACK LOG increase is  $490mil - ($450mil - $200 mil) === $240 million!!! That's the new QNX revenue added from CARS only! I don't think this backlog includes general embedded market that's even bigger than cars!!!**

From last year backlog they needed to subtract the cars cleared within last year since they were likely paid for it. 

I hope this clears everything up. If there's a mistake please let me know."

2021-06-21 20:41:18,wallstreetbets,"No. They don‚Äôt give you the per year breakdown on QNX auto revenue. Instead, they give you the total backlog, which includes all the expected future revenue for a design win across all of that design‚Äôs expected unit volume.

QNX auto has mouse nuts worth of revenue, especially on a per-vehicle basis. Modern vehicles have lots of computers and if any of them use QNX, then $BB counts it as a design win. It could be a simple body controller or the main infotainment computer.

Growth at 9% of a small number is a small number.  Furthermore, auto makers are realizing they have to get better at software and are taking more of that in house. At best, QNX wins a very small revenue slice as a base OS.. which is also easily replaced by Linux. 

On the financial side, BB still has a crappy income statement."

2021-06-21 21:09:59,wallstreetbets,"Can you show once single instance or oem using Linux to run their safety and critical car module? Linux or AGL or iOS of android or Microsoft do not have ASIL D certification!!! Lol! They are joke!!!

2021-06-21 21:03:04,wallstreetbets,"Full of inaccuracies. Prove up your statement re automakers are realizing that they ahould take design in house‚Ä¶ By all accounts I‚Äôve read, OEMs are realizing the exact opposite ‚Äî that they don‚Äôt want to take that platform work in house and better to collaborate. 

Re mouse nuts. John Wall also stated last month that the wins they are gaining in QNX are not one off ECUs but rather the whole platform including hypervisor. He also explained that those wins are going to lead to appreciably higher ASPs per unit."

John Chen was obliged to answer to in the fashion that he did.  It‚Äôs a boiler plate repos e, buddy.  He HAS to respond.

‚ÄúBlackBerry, in response to a request for comment from IIROC, issued a press release around the same time.

‚ÄúThe Company is not aware of any material, undisclosed corporate developments and has no material change in its business or affairs that has not been publicly disclosed that would account for the recent increase in the market price or trading volume of its common shares,‚Äù BlackBerry said in its release.‚Äù"

And QNX  isn‚Äôt the only ASIL D certified RTOS‚Ä¶ Huawei‚Äôs is also certified, as is Azure RTOS. Furthermore, a number of vendors provide the components with ASIL D  precertification and the core functionality is embedded.. the OS is not core to that functionality.

Again, BB has declared the future financial gain to be had so far‚Ä¶ and a YoY increase of 9%, all of $40 million in revenue is mouse nuts in the context of their income statement and market cap."
2021-06-22 06:24:15,wallstreetbets,"Read VW and Ford‚Äôs recent statements.

Define whole platform. Much of the value creation is not in the components that require ASIL D certification, and of the components that do require it, the actual value is not in the RTOS. There are other choices. Again, BB has disclosed the future value and so far, 9% YoY increase of $40 million in revenue is mouse nuts."

It‚Äôs not that new blood is not welcome here, it‚Äôs that the rate this sub has grown has caused a distinct change in culture, a phenomenon known as Eternal September back in the day.

If $AMC hits 4 figures a share, I may do some stupid shit with all that money in generous ways, randomly and anonymously. It would be fun to just leave piles of cash around for people to find with a note that says,, ""finders keepers and congratulations"" and record their reaction. 

But I still have ""4 figure"" doubt. Maybe thats just the skeptic in me or the ""I'm old & dont expect crazy things to happen."""

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ASO - Performance vs Predictions Good evening apes. After an exciting day in the stock market, I wanted to make a follow up post to analyze how ASO has held up against my predictions/analyses, as well as take a look at what kind of play it is exactly. View my previous thoughts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASO/comments/o2zm04/some_aso_technical_analyses_for_your_daddies/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASO/comments/o3ky8b/price_targets/)

If you can't read.... TLDR: $ASO shows the signs of a long term stock that could be both a value and growth play. Notable short term movement is plausible. So far, ASO is following all of my predictions from last week and may reach my $45 EOW price target.

Before diving deep into some charts, let's just get some figures to explain how it is both a value and growth play: 

https://preview.redd.it/m77691pu5p671.png?width=2343&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f8ccc1b48646cebd5d767c6e3eeb3669013c3b8

This Yahoo Finance article is comparing ASO to PLBY. Ignore the PLBY, I'm just interested in the numbers it provides for ASO. First, I'm looking at a P/E of 8.11 and a P/E/G of 1.94. These are excellent numbers for any stock. They indicate significant growth in the company, and essentially tell us that Academy's business model is able to take your $8.11 and turn it into $9.11 at the moment. This is a very straightforward measure of profitability and potential ROI. Additionally, the EPS at last report was $5.45 - also excellent for any company, especially a regional retailer in a pandemic. With these kinds of earnings, it's hard to imagine $ASO not experiencing growth.

The other interesting number here is the P/B of 2.74. While this could be better, it is still lower than many competitors (such as the PLBY they chose to list here). ASO's market cap is also $200M below its enterprise value, which indicates it may be slightly undervalued as well. As a result, I'm sure some people would consider this a potential value play. Personally, I look at it a bit more as a growth play, however, as those numbers are more striking.

Ok - now to some charts. A few days ago, in my previous analysis post, I indicated that ASO should expect to hit its floor and begin tracking upward again within a few days in accordance with its historical SMA movement. It did exactly that, beginning to track upward last Friday, and going even further today. 3 month chart with SMAs overlayed here:

https://preview.redd.it/ubjmrj2n7p671.png?width=2371&format=png&auto=webp&s=9048c8e471eed4ae2660b20242c45c3e849d3d42

As a result of having my predictions here confirmed, as well as seeing \~4% gain today alone, I remain confident in my EOW price target of $45. The last several times that this pattern occured, we saw about 15-30% gains within just a few days. 15% up from its current price at about $40 would be $46, and that's on the low end. I also remain confident that next week, we will hit my $47.50 price target, as it has demonstrated an ability to continue moving a little bit in the week following the initial movement. These patterns have repeated themselves before, and are beginning to again - I see no reason to expect them to suddenly stop now.

Now let's take a look at how the volume has been doing: 

https://preview.redd.it/v4xt87oj8p671.png?width=2289&format=png&auto=webp&s=0da0741659319f7996083f6fcc64f35d1cfd7087

First, I find it interesting that the money flow index stayed in the center all day, but the price continued to go up. This indicates to me that the market has essentially decided it was undervalued at $38 and corrected itself up to around $40. These large green bookends on the volume are also interesting. We can see how the first one kickstarted a nice upswing, but the last one appears under a very flat candlestick. As a result, I remain bullish about tomorrow's trading and expect to see a nice move upward quickly. This chart only helps to confirm my expectations of growth and price target of $45 for this week.

Now, let's see how options are doing:

https://preview.redd.it/nmjzcia59p671.png?width=2752&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc7779bd512a98398493b37e3ef24bbd9f1c2e08

Last Friday, many 40c options expired worthless. However, there are even more already open for July 16. While we may have missed the opportunity to see any gamma moves last week, I would say that July 16 has a strong possibility of being ITM at $40, which would currently require almost one entire day's trading volume to fill. This would definitely have profound effects on ASO gamma movement. With the additional 20k contracts open between $40-50 that could also potentially end up ITM, we could really start to see something interesting happen mid July.

All I have to say about short interest is this: there are still not updated numbers easily available since 5/28. However, based on the numbers available at that time, these are the key numbers to takeaway from short interest:

12M shares short / 54.64M public float = 21.96% of float shorted

12M shares short / 2.6M average volume = 4.65 Days to Cover under normal volume

I anxiously await an update on the Nasdaq short interest board. I will not say anything else on the subject until I see them at this point.

I remain confident in my price targets, and my analysis of the trends is beginning to come to fruition. I like the stock.

This is not financial advice. I am ape."

When interest rate is so low, they should be able to finance expansion pretty cheaply. I think Academy will be dominant sporting goods store for middle class(families earning up to 150k). I have been to BassPro, Dicks, BigFive and Cabela stores. Nowhere do I feel more comfortable than Academy. Cabela and BassPro are pricey and I feel like I am getting ripped off when I enter one. BigFive is like ghetto compared to Academy stores. Academy has this combination of price while not being rundown like BigFive."

That is why they need to increase store count quickly. I want $ASO to be my 10 year compounder.

Greater than 10% of revenues are from firearm/hunting related sales. No firearm product has had a promo running on it for over a year, so they juice up revenues. DNR/GFP in states all over the country ran out of deer tags last year. My state just closed their applications for deer tags. Fishing docks are loaded with people fishing.

On top of that outdoors/camping/etc have gathered massive popularity since COVID. People will continue camping into the future. Look at campground expansion plans in state parks. Massive money is going toward expanding campground capacity.

Outdoor stores are raking it in and ASO is the value play for a sector that's been experiencing insane growth."

Camping has gotten very appealing to upper middle class Americans, because the experience has gotten better. Also campers all have AC in them now."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Bought over 1,000 call contracts today on PRPL. Here's why. PRPL?  Yes, PRPL.

[PRPL Gang Forever](https://preview.redd.it/5o4dmdqn7p671.png?width=1235&format=png&auto=webp&s=d17ed1e0894c47ddd47f128d3c4100a45e3c5e6a)

It's a pretty simple thesis:  nothing has fundamentally changed with PRPL's business outlook from my own previous DD's or others.   PRPL is still selling everything they can possibly make, will continue to do so for the foreseeable future (based upon wholesale door expansion on existing partners alone if you want to simply ignore their massive DTC gains in the last year), and is currently undergoing a massive manufacturing capacity expansion.

Also, PRPL [announced a special off-cycle investor presentation on Friday](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2021/Purple-Innovation-Inc.-to-Host-Virtual-Investor-and-Analyst-Session-on-June-29-2021/default.aspx) that is set for June 29.   They've never done this before.

# Why announce an off-cycle investor meeting unless you have something new and awesome to share?

If anything, it will be a great reminder on the solid fundamentals behind this business.   I also heard that Joe Megibow is going to be wearing his special purple tassel nipple rings for good luck, so that will add at least $5 per share to the price.

Most importantly, PRPL is in an unjustifiable short term price dip.   I shorted 30p for 6/18 with my entire current account a few weeks ago because I was willing to own as much PRPL as possible for a net $28.   Yep, I got assigned, but I'm not even mad.   I'll be printing those too shortly.

Below are my positions and the 1,020 call contracts I bought this am.

https://preview.redd.it/09duqfaa9p671.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ec961bd610149181b20fd6834bb9a281f5d6bc0

I added more capital on last Thursday and immediately entered into a short July 25p position as it was just free money.   With Friday's investor meeting announcement, I closed out the short July 25p's today that I entered into on Thursday and decided to chase delta with a bunch of long calls instead.

I'll see you guys at the moon where I will be doing unspeakable things on a PRPL mattress.

I made my first, second and third million by putting about 300k into PRPL a few years ago.   Looking forward to adding to that body count in the next few weeks.

# What happened to the rest of your money!?!

1. Taxes (this one definitely sucks)
2. Wife (this one definitely doesn't suck)
3. Private Market Investment (this one is amazing and will put me somewhere in the 8 to 9 digit club soon)

I've got another 500k that frees up from that private market investment soon.   I already know where I am going to put it.   It will be a new ticker and you'll see a comprehensive DD soon.   Stay tuned on that one.

In the meantime, PRPL gang is back together!

You were responsible for 80% of a single contracts volume and you mean to tell me it wasn't just to dump it on the readers of this post?

2021-06-22 00:58:32,wallstreetbets,"You can call me or yourself whatever the fvck you want I really don't care at this point. But I do know for a fact your order was sold. I know this because someone bought 25 contracts of the 25c 7/16 for $2.19 eight seconds before your order began to execute at $2.33. It wasn't just ""by chance"" they bought 25 because it was way higher volume than the typical volume of trades on that contract today and eight seconds is just too close (maybe they sold your quote request instead of the execution idk but someone knew you were placing that order before it happened). Whoever they sold that data too probably filled part of your order at $2.33 for a profit of $350 LMAO. Hate me all you want but this is the truth in the execution real which I again linked. Maybe you need to go talk to your broker about that.

Why did I call you out? If you were using a good broker then it would have been closer together.  I assumed the 25 was part of your order and could not sum a combined order that equaled exactly 500. Did I jump to a conclusion? yes. Do people post fake positions that do not coincide with real orders. yes as well. My issue was that you were ether lying (congratulations you're not) or hold a majority of all open interest on that contract which is normally a sign of a P&D.

Additionally, that trade was the first in a series of several hundred contracts and yet somehow this was the only trade you were able to pull out to support your thesis.  See, your speculation is simply that.

When you're done making out with your reflection why don't you look up what you're talking about and not just recycle my own insults. You're using a free/cheap brokerage to move the value of an upscale home, yes they are selling your data. I didn't even have to Google search very hard to find a reference to them selling data on traders who make fools orders. Let me teach you how to not script trades like an idiot because you're burning money with your incompetence on the order of nearly 7 grand for this trade trying to use cool tools you don't understand.

If you intend to buy alot, batch your market order at the size of the highest ask's volume and buy the floor of all near the money strike's asks. If you market order 100 at once on a single option strike with no open interest you're gonna get fucked by the underwriters because they know you are paying to fill more then what's available on the ask unless you're Flagging fill-or-kill. If a HF trader see's an order inbound that will buy all or the majority of the ask they can use their big boy brokerage to execute faster and dump that bag onto you when you're massive crash-out order pushes up the mark. 

But I guess spreading out the strikes wouldn't interested your strategy because then you don't control the pump and dump any more.
Good luck dumping your bag on the fools you con into thinking that you're on the same team. Enjoy prison or bankrupting your parents estate I am sure one of them will find you sooner or later!

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Analysis of Every Stock Being Added to the Russell 2000 this Friday TLDR: Passive funds will buy shares of stocks added to the Russell 2000 this Friday. Some have an **unusually high open call interest relative to float**. Not financial advice.

Gather 'round boys and girls! For those of you who don‚Äôt know, this Friday, the 25th, is when new stocks are added to the Russell 2000 (R2K). I was working with [u/FatAspirations](https://www.reddit.com/u/FatAspirations/) on his latest DD, and he needed to **analyze all of the stocks being added to the R2K**. His idea is to find the stocks market makers will need to buy after inclusion based on open interest, which would indicate stocks with a higher probability of seeing a gamma event after inclusion.

We converted that Russell 2000 PDF into a google spreadsheet and included the total call open interest and shares outstanding for every one of them. I've also added the total July open call interest for the ones with the highest open interest to shares outstanding. I used July since it's the next monthly OPEX after inclusion this Friday. Passive funds will typically start buying at **the end of the day / AHs Friday** to track the Russell 2000 per their fund allocations.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1159Ctd07fKXgAOLeJMZ_xp-XZF5P-pckGHJA2XuNaDQ/edit?usp=sharing) is a spreadsheet with **all 255 new additions to the Russell 2000.** It is ordered by (Open Interest / Shares Outstanding) for those interested in doing DD or developing their own R2K plays. I‚Äôm sharing the spreadsheet to help anyone else looking into R2K plays.

[Ordered by \(Call Open Interest \/ Shares Outstanding\)](https://preview.redd.it/obhuhndiap671.jpg?width=1298&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0112909f084e43bca2487005aa2f9cd48836f4a)

In summary, R2K inclusion should drive up stonk price, which will cause more calls to go ITM, which will create more forced buying as we approach July OPEX.

If you‚Äôre playing R2K inclusion, pay attention to call OI as a percentage of total shares outstanding, and in particular July as it‚Äôs the closest monthly expiration after the June 25th buy-in date.! Some have an unusually high call open interest.. (Not financial advice!)

2021-06-21 20:41:54,wallstreetbets,"147,044 in total July Open Interest for UWMC with 1610m shares outstanding. So a ratio of .09 for July calls and shares outstanding. A big chunk of those calls are at 10 and 11 so it's possible. You'd have to look at the delta spread on the options to give a better estimate of the amount of MM buying for July OPEX.

I dont follow UWMC enough to know how strong it is as an inclusion play but if you're already bullish that ratio would be another bullish catalyst. If it gets above $11 you're likely to see some fireworks."

If the plays already fire then it'll blow big because of the forced MM buying via calls but if it's a poor play it's not going to get better because there's alot of OTM calls. Just keep that in mind when you decide how much you're buying.

If a stock is illiquid then the volume of shares being bought on inclusion will have a much greater impact. How that relates to UWMC (because I have zero idea how liquid it is due to having never followed it) you'll have to judge."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"It's Oil About the Benjamins: Oil to $100 by end of year? TLDR: US, European and Asian recoveries are all back. Cushing stocks back to new lows. Iran's elected a hardline president. Momentum is coming in (along with very possible gamma push). Domestic production crimped by lack of money. This is going to light a fire under crude. 

Trades: XOM (integrated), RRC (or any producer), USO (ETF)

If you have been forced back to work recently or been anywhere on the roads, you would have noticed the traffic has been getting worse. If you've been back to the airports, you'd feel that the terminals are packed again. But everyone has known that since Feb of this year. What's changed? 

1- Cushing stocks are back at new lows. 

[EIA link here](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=W_EPC0_SAX_YCUOK_MBBL&f=W). Demand is damn strong. Like everything in this market since 2020, once demand hits, there is a massive rush towards what little stock is left. Think of agriculture, copper, memestonks. During the earlier part of the year, we've had pretty high stores as demand was still crimped. Now in late June, stores are being rapidly depleted as refiners ramp up. We only really care about domestic demand with Cushing. 

&#x200B;

2- Iran has elected a hardline president. 

That's it. Stick a fork in the Vienna deal. Iran knows that its re-entrance into the world oil markets will be negative. It only cares about the amount of foreign currency it receives, not the number of barrels it exports. If it can continue exporting to Asia if prices are 25% higher, it would rather do that than seeing crude prices decline and having to export more. The new president [has already issued a warning over the talks](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57552639), and will most likely continue to reinvigorate its national defense interests. 

This is the biggest change from a few weeks ago, as the past headwind (optimism for an Iranian deal) has suddenly turned into a headwind. 

3- Momentum is coming in. 

Yes, there is gamma squeeze in oil too. This is a snapshot of all /CL futures contracts. Lots of volume coming in to the calls. Same thing for oil companies, especially upstream/producers. IV on all oil related assets are relatively low (look at the current IV percentile for /CL) because it's been a slightly low rise in prices as we're still concerned about demand and Iran. Now that Iran concern has been removed, it's back to a hot and wild summer.

4- Lack of drilling coming back online. 

The [BH Rig Count](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/baker-hughes-u.s.-rig-count-1652) is surprisingly low for this kind of rally and oil at $70. Last time we were rallying to $70 levels (2010 and 2018) rig counts were were easily double where they are now. Why the lack of drilling? Simply there's no money going towards producers, especially the small marginal producers like 2 men with a truck. One of the main reasons is that there is no money. With all these funds going towards ESG, what's left are handfuls of PE firms, many of which died in 2020. If the money doesn't flow, the oil doesn't flow.

Personally I've put a small $2k yolo in August 80c. Let's see if I can't get a 10 bag from this. The entire CL chain is also very cheap... $100 Dec are only a quarter.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD & deep dive into $CLF. Hey apes, this weekend I spent a ton of time reading about CLF and the steelmaking process and watching a lot of videos on youtube.

  Below is my vision based on company presentations, previous earning calls, 10Ks, 10Qs, and so on.

&nbsp;

**Recent History of $CLF**

  Up until 2018, CLF was an iron-ore miner and producer in the form of pellets that it then sold to integrated steelmakers such as ArcelorMittalUSA and AK Steel. In fact, AMU and AKS, alongside Algoma (Canadian Steelmaker), made up 95% of the total revenue of CLF.

Iron Ore is just the raw material used in the steel-making process, mainly in Blast Furnaces and BOS (Basic Oxygenation Steelmaking). The alternative to the high capital intensive BF/BOS is the Electric Arc Furnace process (EAF). This uses mainly scrap metal and other iron feed, such as HBI/Pig Iron/DRI. These furnaces require less capital upfront to run and have more variable costs attached to them (more to this later, variable ‚â† low cost).

In 2019 CLF acquired AK Steel and in 2020 they acquired ArcelorMittal, thus fully converting themselves into a vertically integrated steel producer.

These acquisitions position CLF as the largest flat steel producer in the US, ahead of Nucor and US Steel.
Annual production is roughly 17 million tons.

&nbsp;

**CLF in 2021**

  With these recent acquisitions, CLF positions itself as a key and major player in the US Steel Industry.
The steel product mix breakdown is 28% hot-rolled steel (HRC), 18% cold-rolled, 33% coated, and 21% in others.

The customer base is 33% auto manufacturers, 25% infrastructure and manufacturing, 32% distributors & converters, and 11% others.

CLF iron ore pellets will be mainly used for intracompany operations so the steel-making operations will not be impacted by the volatility of these prices.

CLF is on a great foot to achieve a record year in 2021 with a $5b projected EBITDA, almost twice as the last 5 years combined.

&nbsp;

**Strategic Vision and Advantages**

  **I)** The auto industry is a key player and customer for CLF. During late 2020 and 2021 automakers haven‚Äôt been able to keep up with demand in new cars and their inventories have fallen to ~20 days, roughly half of what it was a year ago.

So there‚Äôs a lot of backlog demand in automakers, and thus a firm demand for CLF steel products.
The steel used in automaking is mainly AHSS (advanced high-strength steel) which CLF produces and is a high value-added item along with coated still (galvanized, galvalume, etc)

  **II)** During 2021 we have seen an unprecedented rise in steel prices. HRC prices are above $1,600 and started the year at around $1,000. Although CLF has fixed-price contracts with some customers, some naturally are expiring during the year and renovated at higher prices.

2021 Q1 EBITDA was $0.5 and projected Q2 is $1.4b. Full-year projections are $5b, which are totally feasible given the rise in steel prices and backlog for auto production.

Cashflow after CAPEX generated in Q1 was $0.3b (excluding increases in working capital). If cash flow generated during the rest of the year follows the EBITDA trend we can estimate it‚Äôs going to be in the $2.5-$3.0b range.
As the CEO has commented before, this cash would be used primarily to pay the debt accumulated by the company ($5.7b in Q1) that has an average weighted cost of 5,44% per year ($0.3b in annual interest).

  **III)** During the last 20 years US Steel production has migrated from BOS to EAF production. EAF mainly uses scrap metal as feed and depends on its quality and prices for steel production. Its advantages are that the initial capital costs are a fraction (less than 1/3) of what a BOS facility costs. 

As quality scrap becomes scarcer, EAF will need to supplement their feed with other iron products such as HBI.
In 2021 an HBI plant started production in the Great Lakes area producing around 2 million tons per year in order to feed CLF‚Äôs own EAFs and also third parties.  

As we stated previously, EAFs enjoy low capital costs and are driven mainly by their variable costs of energy + scrap metal. But scrap metal prices and volatile.

CLF mainly has BOS operations that benefit from their integrated pellet iron ore production, but also are investing in strategic HBI production so they can sell to this market as well.

  **IV)** US-made steel has the lowest carbon footprint of any steel-making country in the world. It produces almost half the emissions in countries such as Germany and Japan. China is the biggest pollutant country in this respect.
As such, US steel is very well positioned to embrace the climate change challenges and promote itself as green steel.
Also, CLF is trying to migrate to more natural gas use instead of coke (coal-based fuel) for its blast furnace operations.

&nbsp;

**Risks**
  The main risks are the pricing of steel products as revenue is sensitive to them, and also demand, mainly by the auto industry. I believe the demand risk is low because auto-making in the US has been diminishing for some years but it‚Äôs not going to zero. Also, we‚Äôre seeing an increase in EV automakers manufacturing in the US, so that could be a plus.

  Climate and environmental regulations are also a risk, but I believe that US steel and CLF are very well positioned to take them on.

  Competition from other countries is a risk.

Raises in interest rates are also a risk because this is a capital-intensive business. According to the FED, there‚Äôll be some hikes in 2023-2024 but they appear to be moderate and if CFL takes steps to pay part of their debt, this risk will be minor.

&nbsp;

  **Valuation**

I'm not a big fan of DCF valuations, so I just do them to get a ballpark price or the assumptions that need to be met to achieve a certain share price.

  Assuming this year will be an extraordinary one with $2b in FCF, I‚Äôll assume a range of between $0.5b and $1b as FCF for years to come (post interest expenses). This assumes a yearly CAPEX of $0.5b as well. The EBITDA pre acquisitions were around ~$350 million on average so $0.5b seems like a really low bound.
  According to several sites, the WACC seems to be in the 9% to 12% range, so I‚Äôm going to use the upper bound for a margin of safety.
Using a 2% perpetual growth rate (akin to GNP growth) I get a value between ~$23 and ~$45.

A wife is just the raw material used in the home making process, mainly in the bedroom or kitchen (Basic Microwaved Foodmaking). The alternative to the high capital intensive Wife is the Girlfriend process. This uses mainly weekend cash and other petty things such as purses/clothes/AMC. These Girlfriends require less capital upfront to run and have more variable costs to them (you‚Äôll figure this out later) 

In 2019, my Wife acquired a Boyfriend and in 2020 they acquired a house, thus fully converting themselves into vertically integrated money pit."

From her onwards, it should be all upwards as Q2 results and FY forecast is incredibly rosy with current low values and trailing and forward PEs.

CLF will be a $30 stock after Q2 results and should hit $40+ after Q3 and FY results.  Actually based on PEs, CLF should be valued at $80-100 but this would of course be based on what value to place for steel/metal prices.

Inflation is a reflection of spending. Spending ie demand, is up.

When inflation is transitory, meaning prices will come back down in a short period of time, people bail on commodities as an inflation hedge and went back to buying tech stocks."
2021-06-21 22:21:16,wallstreetbets,"5 years is nothing. Steel is cyclical, look way back.

  US Steel ($X) is trading at $28 but has traded at $44 in 2018, $40 in 2014, $60 in 2011 and 2010, and a whopping $200 in 2008. 

  $CLF traded at $26 in 2013, $100 in 2011 and $120 in 2008. And that company was just the old CLF that mined iron ore and produced iron pellets. New CLF has acquired AK Steel and ArcelorMittalUS, making it the biggest integrated steel producer in the US.

  AK Steel traded at $2.5 before being acquired (late 2019). But had highs such as $11 in 2016 and 2014, $23 in 2010 and 2009, and $72 in 2008.

  Historical high for $CLF is almost 5x, and again, of the old company."
2021-06-21 23:01:18,wallstreetbets,"Don't look at stock charts. Look at earnings.

CLF just last week gave updated guidance of $5 billion EBITDA for FY 2021, the stock's mkt cap is $10 billion.

Ask yourself: would you spend $1,000 to buy a business that profits $500 per year? 

That's what you're doing with CLF. With TSLA, for example you're spending $1,000 to buy a business that profits $1.63 per year. 

Obviously, the reason TSLA carries that sort of valuation is because the 10 year exponential growth track is baked in to the current price. CLF? They just finished completing their vertical integration re-structure, and precisely no exponential growth is baked in to the price, in fact its the opposite.

I don't think the market is giving vertical integration enough credit in this current geopolitical climate. CLF is a sleeping giant. This stock could easily be worth north of $100 per share soon if we're at the start of a great American awakening in terms of becoming a global producer again."
2021-06-21 22:11:22,wallstreetbets,We need to see steel prices level off and settle. A constant rise in price will cause smaller firms to hold off on products causing prices to tapper off any way. steel futures holding helps clf shareholders

I feel that there are some kind of looming questions though,

What is the future of steel? Will China dump any surprises on us? 

Will the environmentalists attack steel production? (The blast furnace is super dirty, the EAF is energy intensive, however it is recycling a lot of product which is really good)

I never dogged on CLF, I think they made a really smart integration play, I am just unsure of what the world has in store for steel market"

2021-06-21 23:31:19,wallstreetbets,"The future of steel is the biggest question mark, but the consensus seems to be that current prices are unsustainable and that a lower stable price needs to form. But that base will be higher than historical prices, ~25% below where we are now, and that's still way above historical averages.

  Regarding the environment, US-made steel is the cleanest in the world. Period. It generates half the emissions of Germany's or Japan's. China on the other hand is the most pollutant country in the world regarding steel. CLF is also implementing natural gas into their blast furnaces in order to curb emissions even more (and use less coke in the process). Their target is to cut emissions by 25% in the coming years.

  Also, EAFs are as greener as the electricity source (Nucor is big on EAFs but that relies heavily on the prices and supply of scrap metal). CLF also invested in an HBI plant that went productive this year to complement EAFs use of scrap with iron feed."

2.) We need to produce more at home, both for national security reasons and for the economic benefits

Look at what's in the pipeline with chip fabs. Our politicians argue with each other and filibuster a bill about what color the sky is, but here they are, agreeing that we need to invest money and build chip fabs in the US to shore up multi-faceted issues with outsourcing so much of our production.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Coupang is an undervalued stock. $CPNG -- DD $CPNG - Coupang

# ""Korean Amazon"" with limitless potential.

Coupang is dominating the competition by delivering a next generation experience for retail e-commerce, consumer food services, and digital entertainment in South Korea. There is incredible growth potential ahead as Coupang expands beyond Korea and enters new sectors.

**Stock has room to run and very little competition.**

* The global e-commerce market = $4.9 trillion in 2021. $6.4 trillion expected in 2024.
* Coupang reported net revenue growing 74% Y/Y in Q1.
* The company reaffirmed its solid growth after posting first-quarter results last month on May 12.
* The firm reportedly plans to enter the nation‚Äôs travel sector.
* In April 2021, Coupang expanded into Singapore, the company's first overseas foray.
* On June 4, 2021, Coupang announced that they have started operations in Japan.

Korea‚Äôs e-commerce opportunity is growing at 20% compounded annually. It trails only China as the second-fastest growing region. Coupang‚Äôs dominance suggests that it could become the next **Alibaba.**

In the last seven years, the company invested in end-to-end integration. It has a fulfillment and logistics infrastructure giving Coupang a moat competitors will have a tough time crossing.

The trust of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation made major investment changes in the first quarter by selling all their investments in Apple & Twitter and initiated a position in Coupang.

[Coupang was founded by Bom Kim in 2010. A student of Harvard University](https://preview.redd.it/mxwrazf3cp671.jpg?width=740&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eec66f6772059df073e3651a6973fe06e9b43669)

Short Interest **50.51M**

Float **496.86M**

Takeaway

Coupang is an undervalued stock. It is in the post-IPO phase, which will introduce near-term volatility. Strong quarterly earnings growth will win the most cautious investor. This is a stock that should perform well for investors. 

Position: 450 shares with an average price of 39.30

*Note: I believe Korean dominance is priced in. Japan and Singapore will come online to provide substantial upside. The business combination of Amazon e-commerce and digital entertainment with Uber Eats services are highly attractive. I definitely believe Coupang will take over Asia as an all encompassing service provider of several services. There‚Äôs essentially no limit to the various products they could provide. I know air travel is a focus for Coupang at the moment. Im thinking real estate (Zillow, Beke, Air BNB) , car buying/rentals, expanded food delivery services to restaurants, etc.*

2021-06-21 22:28:28,wallstreetbets,Yeah no way they break into China.
2021-06-21 20:09:52,wallstreetbets,"Lol what. I'm Korean and even I would rather invest in Alibaba over Coupang (which btw, I'm investing in BABA currently).

Amazon won both the cloud and trading around the world (ex-China).

That means, only real money left is in China. And in China, only Chinese companies will thrive. Amazon already took care of America/Europe/Japan. What's Coupang going to take outside Korea?

Also, most of Amazon share price growth is due to Cloud. AWS is the real money maker. The entire world (ex-China) depends on AWS. The only 'possible' competitor is Azure and that's not even a real competitor abroad. Google Cloud is a laughable joke (basically the Google+ of the Cloud). If anything, if you want to invest in Amazon's competitor, go invest in Microsoft.

You want the next Amazon. Then you invest in the only country that can create its own next Amazon. That's China. So go invest in Tencent/JD/Alibaba whatever. You want the next Microsoft? There's none. Just stick to Microsoft there. Or wait, ignore all that and invest in the 'next Amazon' which is legit Amazon. Lord Bezos, our future trillionaire. Maybe 10 years from now we will all be thinking, 'why the f\* didn't I all in Amazon'."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why nothing has changed with $CLNE and I‚Äôm still bullish I saw a few people freaking out about CLNE after Friday didn‚Äôt work out. The gamma squeeze was not the main play with CLNE and while hitting it would‚Äôve been cool, it is literally no big deal that it didn‚Äôt hit it Friday.

Here‚Äôs the quick down and dirty on why I‚Äôm still bullish on CLNE:

1. PRICE TARGETS: CLNE has price targets ranging from $12 all the way up to $30. The majority are averaging around the high teens to early twenties. Which means CLNE is still undervalued by half purely on the worth of the company (no squeezes, no pump plays, just value baby).

2. AMAZON CONTRACT: This has been talked about to death, but Amazon has contracted to buy a massive amount of fuel from CLNE. Their current contract states that they will pay a minimum of $13 and some change for their shares. And before you think they‚Äôll just immediately buy all their shares and dump them, they can only have 5% of the company at the time. So it is heavily in their best interest to get the stock as high as they can to profit on all their shares.

3. NEW CONTRACTS IN THE PIPE: Everyone already knows about the current UPS contract, but there is rumors about an expanded contract coming down the pipe. UPS might be expanding its RNG capacities. Pure speculation, but if true, it will gas TF out of CLNE when announced.

4. OPEN INTEREST OPTIONS: There is an enormous amount of calls open for July. Like 10,000 for each of the closest of strikes. I don‚Äôt get much into squeeze chatting but clearly people are bullish in general.

5. COMPANY IS STILL BUILDING AND LOOKING FORWARD: Naysayers will always say ‚Äúwell why does CLNE break even on all of their financials‚Äù. It is because CLNE reinvests back into their business and increases their lead in the RNG space by leaps and bounds every quarter. RNG is the best solution right now for green trucking right now. EV can‚Äôt do it without a complete overhaul, meanwhile you can buy a kit and convert your current rig into RNG without spending a fortune.

So all in all, if Friday somehow scared you, it shouldn‚Äôt. All the DD is still the same and nothing has changed.

Positions: 500 shares and a bunch of option contracts."

2021-06-22 17:00:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I was on Stash at the time and poured at least $400 into their mini-ETFs about 3/4 down the side of the crater, and every single one is up 40%-70%. I put LOTS of money into their ""Destination Recreation"" ETF because I figured borders would close and vacations would have to be canceled, but that if/when we came out of it, the ETF would go to fucking Jupiter from all the people who had been cooped up at home for so long, and/or closed borders. It's currently up 49%, and I'm holding until the tourism industry makes a full recovery. I also had a once in a lifetime moment of ape-spiration where a single wrinkle appeared on my brain, and threw like a quarter of my investment into their ""Doctor, Doctor!"" ETF because I was staying with my S/O in a hospital room when the entire market fucking cratered, bringing the Healthcare industry with it somewhat. 

Don't recommend them AT ALL for meme-stock investment, though. They only execute trades in 2 or 3 30min windows per day. But I used to put about half my savings into a traditional savings account and the other half goes into Stash, because before the crater I was raking in like 20% gains on average, which is way better than Ye Olde Savings Account interest."
2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH Fundamentals and Highlights \-Wish is a market place that functions as a two-sided marketplace with over 100M monthly active users in 100+ countries. These users are met with nearly 500k merchants with 50k established physical Wish Local locations and offer over 150 million products. There are very few marketplaces of this scale in the world today

\-Something that really excite me about Wish is the fact that CEO rejected the acquisition offer from Amazon and Alibaba FOR USD 10BILLIONS IN 2015! And we are in 2021 with the e-commerce revolution (boosted by quarantine) at only 8 Billion with the price of today

[https://www.businessinsider.com/wish-rumored-to-reject-acquisition-offers-from-amazon-and-alibaba-2015-11](https://www.businessinsider.com/wish-rumored-to-reject-acquisition-offers-from-amazon-and-alibaba-2015-11) 

\-Wish is a marketplace developed to offer Value and Discovery products. It means that you can find rare products and/or cheap products. Its sounds obviously but not all the e-commerce have the same focus. For example, Home Depot has the home improvement nich, Saks Fith Avenue has the luxury nich, and etc... So, you need to know where Wish is focusing to understand the company. You can see the average income of a Wish user is $50k-55k while the Amazon prime is $69k

And it's being very popular

\-Wish dont process payments FOR NOW... But I think they will develop that area as AMZN and EBAY did. There is a big bussines there. You can see how MercadoLibre increased his earnings when he launched MercadoPago

\- Wish is building out what we call a decentralized fulfillment model. Where they look to connect logistics rather than own logistics. By building out an asset light network they can quickly adapt to demand. Wish Local is a critical component as it becomes the last mile warehousing at essentially no marginal cost. To be critical, there are growing pains in this model as Wish becomes dependent on a hyper localized merchant base that is turning into the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the company

\-Bad Things? There are a lot customers complaints about delivery problems, but I think they can solve it easy

So, I think this is the most important things about the company. I will not post any technical analysis and before you ask me: NO, IT'S NOT HEAVILY SHORTED. It only has an 5,84% short interest

I yolo'd into 150 shares, and an option into AMC back in March at like $6/share, and sold at the $67 mark (paper hands sorry).

Ya'll helped me turn $1600ish into close to $20k.. that I desperately needed to close on a house in my neck of the woods. I've been house hungry my entire life, and I just couldn't get the right amount of cash together without some nonsense coming up and wiping my savings out over and over and over."

# What is SKLZ?

‚ÄúSkillz is a San Francisco based **online mobile multiplayer video game competition platform** that is integrated into a number of iOS and Android games. Players use it to compete in competitions against other players across the world‚Äù

What they are actually trying to say is that they are using casino style mechanics in their games by replacing the **‚Äúchance‚Äù** element with ‚Äú**skill**‚Äù. This means that every time you want to compete in a game, you pay **60 cents** up front.

The company went the special purpose acquisition route in 2020 and quickly got picked up by our favourite gambler and stock-picker, **Cathie Wood** from **ARK Invest**, and thrown into her ARKK & ARKW funds **(15.5 million shares in ARKK and 7.5 million shares in ARKW to be exact)**.

&#x200B;

The innovative part about Skillz is that they are not actually a game developer, but rather provide a tech platform that connects mobile gamers and game developers. As mentioned, gamers pay an entry fee and have the chance to win more. Think of it like the future of mobile games being powered by highly addictive gambling technology.

Their business model slide shows it in a neat way

https://preview.redd.it/pgohk981po671.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b2d296bcf3a49590c6d45b60f82cf0658c7658a

# Why are they being shorted, and what's the bear case.

The bear case is actually much easier on this one. They are making a couple hundred million in revenue, but nowhere near enough to justify such a high market cap. At the moment, their pricey forward P/S implies extreme future growth.

On top of that, they were targeted by a securities class action lawsuit 3 months ago, regarding some statements they made in their public offering prospectus. I personally think that this lawsuit doesn‚Äôt have too much merit since it looks like a classic case of a law firm trying to find a case and make a quick buck. Trying to get some poor schmuck 1.70$ back on their SPAC purchase isn‚Äôt really going to have a long term impact on anything.

# Why could they have a massive upswing?

Unlike most shorted companies which are completed cash strapped, in debt and struggling to survive another day, Skillz has a very strong balance sheet, including **$ 613 million in cash**. You can get most of the important bits out of their Q1 earnings presentation, but one nice way to summon up their potential is the following quote:

*‚ÄúSkillz is a¬†technology platform,¬†and its* ***profit potential is off the charts.*** *It's not developing games, it's providing the space that brings gamers and developers together. In the third quarter of 2020, the company's gross margin was* ***94.8%****, and it was* ***95.5%*** *through the first three quarters of 2020. These flashy numbers suggest that Skillz can leverage revenue growth into substantial cash flow.‚Äù.*

Their growth numbers and margin is *very* *good,* and the business model is a sneaky way to circumvent gambling laws. The technology is solid, and good enough to make it into the ARK funds.

I would suggest everyone to have a good look at their [IR presentation here](https://investors.skillz.com/events-and-presentations/presentations/default.aspx) to also understand their business better and have that same **f#ck yes** moment that I had, before dropping a big wad of cash on them.

**By June25th they will be added to the Russell 3000, meaning every ETF with exposure to Russell 3000 will load up on shares, starting July.**

Apart from Russell 3000 and Cathie, the stock already has a very large following on Stocktwits with people trading it up and down.

# What's the price action?

Skillz went live at $10.26 and managed to shoot up to $43. Since then, they took a nose dive with more and more people started shorting it, until it hit $12.55 in April 2021 before quickly recovering and creating a double bottom around $19-20. The current short interest hovers around 30% with roughly 71 million shares sold short. I think at this price it‚Äôs a fantastic time to buy in and give the shorts a little pinch.

&#x200B;

# Acquisitions and future plans?

Having cash on hand, they just announced this month the acquisition of Aarki, to form the First Integrated Esports Advertising Platform. *‚ÄúAarki is described as a leading technology-driven marketing platform that engages in more than 5T monthly advertising auctions. Aarki uses data engines and proprietary machine learning algorithms to deliver ROI for performance advertisers.‚Äù*

Now why is this awesome? With Aarki, they can aggressively widen their footprint in the mobile gaming industry and turn the monetization to another level. This is however long term stuff that will take time to play out, with the acquisition happening towards Q4.

[Link here.](https://investors.skillz.com/events-and-presentations/events/default.aspx)

# How could this be a YOLO?

The bear case is way overdone and 71 million shorts is quite a lot given the company has cash on hand and good margins. The price heavily fluctuates, giving excellent entry and exit points + aggressive pops when shorts have to cover. The addition to the Russell 3000 could drive the price way up and if retail sentiment stays high

The only downside is though that the IV is quite high. The stock could be at 30 in a month, 40, or back down at 10$. Options are expensive unless they are OTM.

I decided to drop in with $5000 in shares today, looking overall for an **100 - 300 % return. (link in comments).**

**TL:DR**

* **Innovative gaming tech to monetize tournament style mobile games**
* **71.5 million shares currently sold short**
* **Joining the Russell 3000 by end of next week**
* **23 million shares currently held in Cathie Wood's ARK fund**
* **Strong StockTwits community pick**

**Now, please do your own DD. This is risky shit. And as always, this is not financial advice, I like Skillz. I hope this was interesting to some of you who prefer straight up YOLOs.**

2021-06-22 09:18:11,wallstreetbets,"Hate this stock, I think the bear cash outweighs the bull case.

You've pointed out currectly how much their current market cap is based on their projected growth, and that's just at the current price. I don't see any reason why it should be worth more than $2b.

Have you seen the games they're trying to make work as an ""esports""? [Here's the list from their website](https://games.skillz.com/). I see why someone would chuck a few dollars at it, but how is it going to grow? They're not going to grab any market share from PC/console esports. They're stuck with what they have. Iterations of Solitaire and pool/snooker, woo.

My opinion: Mobile esports as a concept isn't going to be a limelight event. Nobody wants to watch it on a tournament scale (like DotA, LoL, Rocket League etc) so the reach is minimal.

I think it's a $7 stock, and nothing I read here has changed my mind.

Saying that, I hope WSB manages to squeeze it all the way up and you all make money. Because I'll be looking to short it back down."
2021-06-22 06:18:25,wallstreetbets,"The bears, led by prominent short-seller Wolfpack Research, claimed the growth of Skillz's top three games had peaked, its growth forecasts were ""unrealistic,"" and it had exaggerated the impact of a recent NFL deal to enable its insiders to sell millions of shares at ""inflated prices."""

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"8th Grade Research Project: $AMZN doesn't need $RAD Amazon will not acquire RAD.

&nbsp;

Too much has to happen for Rite Aids to become an ""Amazon store""; You know [the look](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/23/business/22AMAZONGO-1/22AMAZONGO-1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg). Even Amazon's internal healthcare locations have the look. Just check out [the inside of your local Rite Aid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Aisles_and_goods_in_the_Rose_Hill_Rite_Aid.jpg/800px-Aisles_and_goods_in_the_Rose_Hill_Rite_Aid.jpg) and tell me its the same.

&nbsp;

The more intriguing options are 1) having no physically stores, or 2) use Whole Foods locations. Way back when Amazon first acquired Whole Foods, CVS, Walgreens, even drug wholesalers took major hits. Amazon already has 2/3 of what Rite Aid would offer: locations to act as distribution, if they were to go that route. But they will most likely continue offering pharmacy drugs through their existing channels: PillPack LLC and Amazon Pharmacy. 

&nbsp;

Amazon acquired PillPack for $753 million 2 years ago and has been working within Amazon Pharmacy on the home delivery for medication. Very little is said about this part in their investor reports, I was only able to find a few bullet points in the last couple years, but this looks extremely clear what Amazon is trying to do. They have Whole Foods for the brand and ability to deliver high end/organic groceries and Amazon Fresh for the normal things you'd find at a Walmart. Its always been about home delivery and only about how brick and mortar assists with that. A physical store acquisition ""quickly"" establishes a physical presence, but I don't see the need for one to move drugs. Or how that bolsters they're ability to deliver to homes. They have the facilities and logistics worked out for hundreds of grocery delivery warehouses and seems much more simple to tac on drugs there. 

&nbsp;

Between the [Q4](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx) and [Q1](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx) reports they added another 10,000 to total 60,000 local pharmacies that offer discounts to prime users when paying without insurance. Why aggressively explore this if you were thinking of opening thousands of your own stores? Seems curious to me. 

&nbsp;

People here seem to be quick to write off PillPack as a failure with no justification. Summarizing a [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/why-amazon-bought-pillpack-for-753-million-and-what-happens-next.html) written around the acquisition:  More than 60% of American's have chronic illness and 40% have two. The average PillPack user in 2018 generated ***$5,000 in revenue***. The business was on track to generate $299 million in annual revenue [in 2018], with plans to more than double in 2019 to $635 million before reaching $1.2 billion in 2020. And medicine spending is expected to increase 3-6% through 2025. The long term outlook on PillPack is bright and Rite Aid just isn't the right choice for Amazon. I'll be honestly surprised if they ever actually announce they're buying them considering how long theres been rumors. 

&nbsp;

Also I don't think they would be eager to shell out more money after the MGM $8.5 billion buyout in May. They usual go about a year between >$1B purchases.  

#Telehealth trends due to COVID:
My thinking here is to look at the usage of online services in medicine due to COVID. It's my assumption that effects from COVID in many aspects are here to stay. Remote work is a good example and I see no reason why routine medical care, and even more routinized pharmacies couldn't be done online. I found [this gem from the CDC looking at Jan-Mar 2020 trends in telehealth](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943a3.htm). Here's a [chart comparing 2019 to 2020](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/figures/mm6943a3-F1.gif) and this quote summarizes the major part:
>During the early pandemic period in 2020, the percentage of telehealth visits for persons aged 18‚Äì49 years increased slightly, from 68% during the first week of January 2020 to 73% during the last week of March .

A 5% increase in telehealth visits that happened almost entirely in March, a time when COVID wasn't seen as a problem in the US so we can assume it is substantially higher now. Cathie's TDOC pick isn't wrong, I can do a dive into them later if requested. But I think this points to online medicine continuing to become mainstream and the perfect environment for Amazon to fit in by delivering prescribed medication. People are becoming more time greedy (no commuting with remote work, food delivery/pick up) and don't want to waste the time of going into a store and wait in line.

#LinkedIn:
I sorted by people working for PillPack LLC or Amazon Pharmacy and got back 904 people currently working there, I'll say 950 for margin. Amazon's corporate job portal shows [99 full time openings](https://jobs-us-west.amazon.com/en/teams/pillpack). Thats a 10.5% increase of their workforce. They are looking to expand PillPack/Amazon Pharmacy. 

#TA:
Little TA an AMZN bc why not? Bounced off 2 st dev line yesterday, I'd wait if we dip more back to $3400 ish where theres some support. Could just as easily break through up though, it's been trading sideways for pretty much a year. Charts looks kinda retarded considering how solid their earnings have been for the last 3 quarters.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why inflation is here, and how to actually make money on it (hint: it‚Äôs not shorting indexes) It‚Äôs no real secret that inflation is here. And it‚Äôs not ‚Äútransitory.‚Äù Especially once wages start increasing, as those are extremely difficult if not impossible to bring back down.

Currently there are shortages in everything. Homes, cars, services, computer chips, even my local BBQ place ran out of brisket. Why is this? It‚Äôs not because every single thing has happened to have a shortage at the same time, it‚Äôs because everything is under priced from it‚Äôs fair value. The supply/demand curve that we all learn in high school economics, where it meets in the middle and that creates your price, is currently not in the middle. Places are charging prices that are way too cheap, because they haven‚Äôt gotten on board yet / are phasing it slowly to not cause negative PR. In capitalism things should never be out of supply, that means they‚Äôre not priced correctly.

How to make money on this

So you understand that inflation = bad. You also understand indexes going down = bad. So you figure, since both are bad they are correlated. And puts on indexes is the play. If you think this you‚Äôre not alone, many hedge funds and large institutions believe this. You all have something in common though, you‚Äôre all retarded.

Inflation is nuanced. It‚Äôs horrible, but there is one good thing to inflation, and the reason the government causes it. It makes stock prices go uppies 

So if you understand inflation is coming, what do you do? A bull may just begin buying calls on all the indexes, which will most likely pay off. But if you want to maximize profits. You should do the following.

Calls on $Commodities 

Commodities do the best under inflation, as they are the first step in a supply chain, and so the first thing that raises prices. Steel, livestock, these are all exceptionally good plays. Stay away from precious metals, they‚Äôre just pure speculation 

Puts on $TLT

When inflation happens, after the initial retard panic selling we saw last week, investors quickly realize they need to be in something (like stocks) to preserve their wealth, and that cash is useless. Bond yields shoot up, and puts on bonds can make a fortune 

These 2 plays hedge you perfectly for any inflation fears. The worse inflation gets, the more these 2 plays are guaranteed to print. Not all other inflation hedges can say that

Edit: positions: 410 CLF 23 calls august 20 expiration, 275 TLT 139 puts September 17th expiration. Dated 3 months out these let you play inflation fears all summer"
2021-06-21 20:01:51,wallstreetbets,"I've been thinking about this for a while too, and I have to agree the FED can't effectively control inflation. However if the FED were to hike rates the market would crash, and recession would come, next year we have mid term elections I am not sure the FED is properly incentivized to hike rates. People in general don't understand inflation as well as they understand recession, and unemployment, that's why I think they won't hike rates until second term elections. 

That being said I think inflation is going to get out of control, and I am hedging by buying shares of CLF and GOLD and other commodities. 

When the hike rate comes it will be too late, and we'll see a really big crash."

2021-06-22 01:24:17,wallstreetbets,"Nothing mind blowing here. In times of inflation = calls on commodities and puts on treasury bonds. Got it.

My problem is, what if inflation *is* transitory and there is no market crash. Generally when markets crash, no one expects it to happen and only a few one-eyed autists can spot it. Now, e*veryone* expects the market to crash and *everyone* assumes that  inflation is here to stay. In my experience when the masses expect the market to do something, it rarely plays out.  Commodities have already started to correct with lumber, copper and gold down. who the fuck knows, I'm a contrarian gambler....I mean investor, so good luck with your bets."
2021-06-22 01:45:52,wallstreetbets,"OP, why are not banks on your mind? You know the fed will taper off QE and raise rates to combat inflation. Higher rates means the  banks books will be a lot better looking."

2021-06-22 11:51:25,wallstreetbets,"TLDR OP thinks inflation is not transitory, fed thinks it isn‚Äôt so certain. Falling lumber prices suggest it will be. If OP is right, his plays are right. If lumber is indicative of the future, his plays are wrong."

2021-06-22 13:22:58,wallstreetbets,Yes that‚Äôs the one. The lumber that has fallen from 1400 to 900 in a month.
2021-06-21 21:33:33,wallstreetbets,"That's what inflation is.  It's a measure, not a cause."
2021-06-21 22:05:35,wallstreetbets,It's already at 5%

Also they charged a little premium up front by only selling at the Ask.  I tried putting in the order halfway between bid-ask and got denied even after giving it some time."
2021-06-22 13:25:04,wallstreetbets,"Ok so the lumber that‚Äôs twice as high as it was a year ago.

Just 100% inflation YoY. That‚Äôs nothing! At this rate it will only take 30 years before there isn‚Äôt a single person on earth able to buy lumber.  Under control!"
2021-06-21 20:23:11,wallstreetbets,"When J Pow says that the fed is starting to talk about thinking about a 100 basis point rate hike in 2 years, the market immediately shits the bed.

They can stop inflation but it will come at the expense of equity markets."
2021-06-22 10:25:49,wallstreetbets,"3% for the year, not monthly"
2021-06-22 10:45:16,wallstreetbets,That's for goddamn sure.
2021-06-22 13:35:06,wallstreetbets,"The key is whether it is transitory or not - you said that yourself.  A 40% fall in a month after a doubling in 12M suggests it was a spike but, like every expert says apart from yourself, no-one knows if the drop in price will continue but it has already gone from 900 in March to 1700 in May and back to 900 a month later.  So yes it is 2x YoY but it is currently in free fall."
2021-06-21 23:08:39,wallstreetbets,"It would spook markets, but it would help stabilize things long term. IRs were high in the 80s and the markets went on a decade long tear"
2021-06-22 13:40:00,wallstreetbets,"It has to fall below 500 or else it‚Äôs out of control hyper inflation.

25% inflation YoY takes only 5 years to triple in price. 10 years to 10x in price. 20 years to 100x in price. Even 5% YoY inflation is not sustainable.

The market got pushed extra high from wild FOMO speculation, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not on a very very concerning uptrend"
2021-06-21 23:25:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I‚Äôd love to see higher rates personally.  This zero IR shit is a global phenomenon though.  I do, however, agree that higher rates would flush out a lot of bad debt."
2021-06-22 13:44:54,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 1 Month
2021-06-22 08:53:08,wallstreetbets,"Rates have stayed low and that has been fine because inflation has stayed within the Fed's target, the; but now that the pendulum has begun to swing they need to raise rates, but they can't without triggering a massive stock crash, even though propping up the stick market isn't in the Fed's mandate, they're still somewhat beholden to it, at least the potential ramifications of one.



Their justification at the moment, that the current inflation bump is temporary and won't be persistent (covid), is somewhat logical, but that doesn't mean it will play out that way. I think there are strong arguments for inflationary forces to continue to push up, well after the recovery"
2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Going for the high score!

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"So SPY didn't hit $1000... I'm FUMING! Okay, where do I start? Firstly, my username is not a joke!

So I was casually, stressfully scrolling through the Daily Discussion when I noticed a comment.

This particular comment caught my eye (finger, since I use braille) as it claimed ***""SPY to $1,000 by EOD""***

[Photographic Evidence](https://preview.redd.it/q1c11kc7gn671.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=174cdf68b8b81fbc0beaf6fade73593794488805)

Seeing as r/wallstreetbets is famous for it's high quality financial advice, I immediately looked further into this new meme stock, ""SPY"", and to no surprise, it was primed for a short gamma super squeeze of all squeezes, also known as a **SGSSOAS**.

I then used an online tool, also known as a search engine, to discover the meaning behind ""EOD"". This is what I found;

I then used an eggplant, as suggested by the financial adviser's flair, to make a chart prediction:

Seemed legit... so with my DD done, I proceeded to sell my house and car, to put everything into SPY. (Yes, it's a voice-control car, since I have a visual impairment)

pushing 60% now

And what exactly has happened to the share price with this insane shorting to try to depress the price and reduce interest? Oh, it's actually gone slightly up in this timeframe. 

So shorts have taken 2 weeks of paying over $100k per day to borrow more and more shares digging a deeper and deeper hole and they have actually lost ground on the share price! SMH, those shorts are clinically insane.

2021-06-21 21:19:49,wallstreetbets,Just keep stacking.

2021-06-21 21:14:51,wallstreetbets,Take from someone who has lived in that area. Nothing survives there. That Lordstown plant was a GM plant and even they got of there.
2021-06-21 21:39:56,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll hop back on the BB train if I see it change but from a long time holder please take my advice and not 2 second DD from Reddit.

BB IS A LONGTERM 1-5 YEAR STOCK FOR (MAYBE) DECENT RETURNS. So far switching to wish ( a little CLNE and clov) but mainly wish I‚Äôve made insane profit. Not rich or down payment but definitely second job worthy profit.

Do your DD, BB is a shit investment right now, let it dip so we can buy the dip for true gains"

## FOMC (Jerome) SPEECH BEGINS AT 2:00pm TOMORROW


## Here‚Äôs what too look for in the markets:


The alpha bear saw an entry point and began to drill his member into SPY. She closed her eyes and clenched her jaw hoping someone, anyone would help her find an exit strategy. Just as soon as the alpha entered his position he was met with resistance. 

With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market‚Äôs hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

‚ÄúThank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.‚Äù

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she‚Äôs not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: ‚ÄúI put on my robe and wizard hat.‚Äù"

Seropositive means you have been infected with virus.   Texas only has 37 of people vaccinated but has a seropositive rate (estimated) of 33 percent, meaning a third of the people in Texas have been infected with Covid-19.  The question is how much over lap between the two groups?  I would be willing to bet it is not very much. let say its 10% of people have had covid got vaccinated.  That still gives Texas a combined resistant person percentage((vax +(inf-10% of Inf)) of 67 % very near the 70% goal of herd immunity."

‚ÄúI believe we‚Äôve found it Bronson. The key to understanding what happened here, why this place and it‚Äôs people disappeared...‚Äù

Bronson steps forward, his eyes fixed downwards on the source. 

‚ÄúAt this range I can decode it.  We‚Äôll finally have the answer‚Äù. 

He pulls out a small device from his tool belt and kneels near the source, extending his arm to capture the signal. As he watches, his eyes begin to water up and then he collapses to the ground. 

‚ÄúBronson!  What‚Äôs happening, are you ok?!‚Äù

The captain rushes toward him, but is shocked to see that Bronson is laughing. 

‚ÄúWhat is this madness? What does it say?‚Äù bemoans the captain. 

Bronson looks up, a strange knowing look on his face. 

‚ÄúThe truth‚Äù he says, ‚Äúis that they aren‚Äôt that different from us, captain. PLTR will hit 26, I know it now.‚Äù

I'm a bear now (new prof pic) but also still a permabull. Basically I'm bullishly bearish. 

12% correction AKA ""the big one"" starts tomorrow around lunch. I feel it in plums.

My play is SQQQ calls. CRSR will probably be green though, it's gonna be weird.

Look, I'm not bias. Historically speaking, Chinese accounting has been a liiiiitle sketchy when it comes to reporting up-to-date and accurate figures.

Particularly so with companies that are tightly wound around the state and have low international institutional ownership and/or the international institutions have a high degree of unreliability (I.e. disproportionate ratio of Chinese company ownership, or previous/current connections to CCP.)

I don't want to warn anyone about a specific ticker, or group of tickers, but genuinely be conscious of what you're buying into. Call me paranoid, but I'm not jumping on any bandwagon."

2021-06-21 20:03:26,wallstreetbets,"THE FREE FLOAT THEORY ON $CLOV

Hello all you may know me from the Youtube world as Dutch Trades. Now I wanted to come on here and share my finding into the recent speculation that the free float is being wrongly calculated. Now I Have used the infamous **Roaring Kitties formula** to find the exact actual float. That formula is as stated:

&#x200B;

**Float - institutions= the real free float into a stock.**

&#x200B;

Now currently the float states it is at a total of **153,016,867**. Which this number includes Green Oaks wrongly classified Class A shares. Now we all know that the latest documents that come out yesterday have then confirmed that Green Oaks shares are Class B and not Class A.

&#x200B;

So the whole dilemma circulating on this whole situation is the fact that they are currently calculating this wrong. If we use the formula and subtract the **96,331,338** from the Float posted.

&#x200B;

**153.016,867-96,331,338 = 56,685,529**

This would equal the actual free float with the Green Oaks shares being accurately calculated.

&#x200B;

With the provided Ortex date currently:

&#x200B;

[ORTEX DATA](https://preview.redd.it/mj2sd3jl6p671.png?width=2838&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c2f759ba161e8b0ad4c694248bfd931911b8f4)

We can see that the estimate current Short Interest is = **52.58 million shares, and the shares on loan currently sit at 59.16 million.**

&#x200B;

Now if we do some simple math here by seeing that shares on loan currently is at that **59.16 million**

We simple just divide the shares on loan by the correct float.

**59.16 million / 56,685,529 = 104% of the float is short**

This has been my findings and DD on it all here are the documents they posted today that states they are Class B and not Class A.

&#x200B;

[SEC FILING FROM TODAY](https://preview.redd.it/ejes91dj8p671.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2c474e3699862e7bd97aad73b8ceaf3276df9a0)

Here is the link as well : [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/node/7306/html](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/node/7306/html)

&#x200B;

I have reached out to numerous people stating this false information they are posting onto their data sources of wrongly having their calculations about $CLOV. I have yet to hear any conformation back yet but these are my findings on all of it and why it would be a big deal.

&#x200B;

If you were or were not apart of the GME mega squeeze then this is the exact scenario of what happened and I am not saying we are going to repeat it but this is the EXACT same that happened. The man Roaring Kitty debunked the whole thing and that is how they got that ridiculous number of the float being short over 100%.

&#x200B;

We have ourselves a GME 2.0 IMO and no one is talking about it enough so I wanted to go on here and clearing explain the math and the procedure on how I got this number and the provided documents with it all.

&#x200B;

On another note CLOV came out today as well in their SEC filing and stated a disclaimer warning about a short squeeze that could occur in their stock. Here is the statement on that from the document:

[Document proof same link as earlier as well ](https://preview.redd.it/nb89qvjn9p671.png?width=1750&format=png&auto=webp&s=990076e48ed1099a74bcc376c28e875bce9ff2a7)

&#x200B;

Funny that this happened, because guess who also had this happen to them before an absolute moon shot of a move???? You guessed it was **GAMESTOP**.

&#x200B;

Also another thing that confirmed this and brought it to my attention was the Russel 3000 deletion. If you all do not know the reason they did get deleted was due to ""failed voting rights"" which here is the reasoning on that: 

[https:\/\/research.ftserussell.com\/products\/downloads\/Minimum\_Voting\_Rights\_Hurdle\_FAQ.pdf?\_ga=2.158045113.2035201761.1602685218-1267924083.1596218340](https://preview.redd.it/ukznz6r6bp671.png?width=2570&format=png&auto=webp&s=690b6b45eb5350ff91251b95cca8064a64bb9b47)

&#x200B;

By reading that you can see that they got deleted due to having less than 5% of unrestricted free float available to purchase which was just another confirmation that something more was going on and somebody is inaccurately calculation the statistics.

&#x200B;

Now all the signs our pointing in our direction and I wanted to come on hear for people to understand it as simple as possible with some simple ape math.

&#x200B;

CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG ON ANY OF THESE STATEMENTS OR CALCULATIONS

&#x200B;

Hope you all enjoy.

So everyone jumped into TLRY and SNDL with the majority of people jumping into SNDL because if it's low price.  Unfortunately SNDL is a shit company with like almost 2 billion shares issued and at that level of dilution it was destined to never be much more than a pump and dump.  So a bunch of apes bought into a penny stock at $3.50 with all of their GME earnings and then got left holding the bag after it dropped down to oblivion where it belongs.    


So now they haunt the forums desperately trying to pump a dead garbage stock hoping to reclaim even half of what they've lost.  Unfortunately with that much dilution you need volume in like 300-500M numbers to get the price to move in any appreciable amount and the apes have grown too smart to approach such a fetid corpse of a stock no matter how much people beg them to do so."

2021-06-22 02:41:44,wallstreetbets,Nobody *sets* the values. The values are statistical representations of market sentiment.
2021-06-22 02:38:33,wallstreetbets,"The premium of an option is mathematically calculated to be within a range, the market does not have to reflect that of the statistical probability of the underlying, however if there is a large difference in the premium versus expected price often the market will slowly shift to that of the expected value, or the premium if inflated or deflated enough can then change the implied volatility of an underlying which then gets priced into all other options. IV is not a Greek but it almost if not more important to determining an options value (price). Also if there is any market that does not reflect the value of a contract market makers will use it as an arbitrage opportunity and cash in immediately."

2021-06-21 20:02:25,wallstreetbets,"THE FREE FLOAT THEORY ON $CLOV

Hello all you may know me from the Youtube world as Dutch Trades. Now I wanted to come on here and share my finding into the recent speculation that the free float is being wrongly calculated. Now I Have used the infamous **Roaring Kitties formula** to find the exact actual float. That formula is as stated:

&#x200B;

**Float - institutions= the real free float into a stock.**

&#x200B;

Now currently the float states it is at a total of **153,016,867**. Which this number includes Green Oaks wrongly classified Class A shares. Now we all know that the latest documents that come out yesterday have then confirmed that Green Oaks shares are Class B and not Class A.

&#x200B;

So the whole dilemma circulating on this whole situation is the fact that they are currently calculating this wrong. If we use the formula and subtract the **96,331,338** from the Float posted.

&#x200B;

**153.016,867-96,331,338 = 56,685,529**

This would equal the actual free float with the Green Oaks shares being accurately calculated.

&#x200B;

With the provided Ortex date currently:

&#x200B;

[ORTEX DATA](https://preview.redd.it/mj2sd3jl6p671.png?width=2838&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c2f759ba161e8b0ad4c694248bfd931911b8f4)

We can see that the estimate current Short Interest is = **52.58 million shares, and the shares on loan currently sit at 59.16 million.**

&#x200B;

Now if we do some simple math here by seeing that shares on loan currently is at that **59.16 million**

We simple just divide the shares on loan by the correct float.

**59.16 million / 56,685,529 = 104% of the float is short**

This has been my findings and DD on it all here are the documents they posted today that states they are Class B and not Class A.

&#x200B;

[SEC FILING FROM TODAY](https://preview.redd.it/ejes91dj8p671.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2c474e3699862e7bd97aad73b8ceaf3276df9a0)

Here is the link as well : [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/node/7306/html](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/node/7306/html)

&#x200B;

I have reached out to numerous people stating this false information they are posting onto their data sources of wrongly having their calculations about $CLOV. I have yet to hear any conformation back yet but these are my findings on all of it and why it would be a big deal.

&#x200B;

If you were or were not apart of the GME mega squeeze then this is the exact scenario of what happened and I am not saying we are going to repeat it but this is the EXACT same that happened. The man Roaring Kitty debunked the whole thing and that is how they got that ridiculous number of the float being short over 100%.

&#x200B;

We have ourselves a GME 2.0 IMO and no one is talking about it enough so I wanted to go on here and clearing explain the math and the procedure on how I got this number and the provided documents with it all.

&#x200B;

On another note CLOV came out today as well in their SEC filing and stated a disclaimer warning about a short squeeze that could occur in their stock. Here is the statement on that from the document:

[Document proof same link as earlier as well ](https://preview.redd.it/nb89qvjn9p671.png?width=1750&format=png&auto=webp&s=990076e48ed1099a74bcc376c28e875bce9ff2a7)

&#x200B;

Funny that this happened, because guess who also had this happen to them before an absolute moon shot of a move???? You guessed it was **GAMESTOP**.

&#x200B;

Also another thing that confirmed this and brought it to my attention was the Russel 3000 deletion. If you all do not know the reason they did get deleted was due to ""failed voting rights"" which here is the reasoning on that: 

[https:\/\/research.ftserussell.com\/products\/downloads\/Minimum\_Voting\_Rights\_Hurdle\_FAQ.pdf?\_ga=2.158045113.2035201761.1602685218-1267924083.1596218340](https://preview.redd.it/ukznz6r6bp671.png?width=2570&format=png&auto=webp&s=690b6b45eb5350ff91251b95cca8064a64bb9b47)

&#x200B;

By reading that you can see that they got deleted due to having less than 5% of unrestricted free float available to purchase which was just another confirmation that something more was going on and somebody is inaccurately calculation the statistics.

&#x200B;

Now all the signs our pointing in our direction and I wanted to come on hear for people to understand it as simple as possible with some simple ape math.

&#x200B;

CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG ON ANY OF THESE STATEMENTS OR CALCULATIONS

&#x200B;

Hope you all enjoy.

Today I receive a ""Congratulations"" notice from Robinhood that my order to sell everything was fulfilled.  I thought I must have stupidly sold it by knocking my phone around in my pocket ‚Äæ\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/‚Äæ 

I called in and got a response call rather quickly.  They admitted they took it upon themselves to sell all my positions. They said they emailed me earlier in the month. I cannot find the email. I interact with the app multiple times a day. There is a message center in the app, yet Robinhood chose to send this important message to me in a way that almost guarantees it will be filtered out as spam. What level of bullshit is this?  

The guy from Robinhood had no answers other than to say that they had emailed me. He had no ability to answer any of my questions or connect me with a knowledgable person. All he could do is put me on a list for his manager to return my call. Then he complained about how difficult it is for them to make ""thousands of calls a day""..... as if I give a f''' about how snowflake difficult his job is.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"An overly long question about taxes on stocks This is a very simple question but because of the page rules it apparently needs to be very long and complicated. I'm somewhat new to using reddit and very new to this community so please understand if this is already common knowledge. I tried Googling a bit on taxes and stocks but didn't see and answer to this specific type of question. I also just tried making this a comment but I can't because of something called karma. 

If I have 10k and I lose 1k but then gain 1.1 k, is the full 1.1k taxed or is just the 100 dollars net gain taxed? That's my main question. I understand the rules and everything for short posts but honestly I don't have any way to go deeper into this question than that. The best thing I can think to do is just ask another question. 

I can't seem to understand why people yolo into a stock at one price. Why not stagger your buys so that if the underlying stock loses value after your first purchase you can just buy again to lower your profit threshold? Let's say you buy 10 stocks for 100 and then the value drops to 90. You can then buy another 10 stocks, lowering your profit margin to 95, and even if the stock goes back to 100 without increasing further you can just sell at 100 for a 100 dollar profit. You didn't make anything on the initial 10 but you made 100 on the second set. Combine this with cash covered puts and you have a pretty solid buying strategy in my eyes.

Then again I've been trading for like a whole of a month or two so this could be pretty stupid. Well, this is getting kinda long although i have no idea if it's long enough but I have to get back to work. I'm gonna copy and try to make it longer later if it doesn't work. Also is there a place I can put not very complicated questions like this or is this pretty much the only way. 

Thank you in advance, and may your hands carry the blessing of the diamond and also insatiable greed too."

Tired of him going long on your credit card? Looking for a company to invest in that is actually profitable? The answer to all your questions is yes! With Big Lots ($BIG) you have found your solution.

[ Please God take my life, I can‚Äôt afford all this for my wife‚Äôs boyfriend ](https://preview.redd.it/mmxkdpsi3o671.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=528b83b519bce253ed0cdea7034ee2f3e684f3f2)

The topics that will be covered in today‚Äôs presentation:

¬∑ **General overview of business model**

¬∑ **Financial overview**

¬∑ **Operation North Star**

¬∑ **Shareholder value**

Big Lots, Inc ($BIG) is a neighborhood discount retailer operating 1,408 stores and an e-commerce platform. Its mission is to help people live BIG and save LOTS by providing customers with the right product at the right price. You‚Äôre probably asking ‚ÄúWho shops at stores anymore given everything is done online?‚Äù Surprisingly, a lot of people. There will always be a market for in-store shopping because 1) some things are too big to be shipped such as furniture 2) not everyone wants to wait for their item(s) to be shipped. This is where the real appeal of $BIG stands out, their Buy Online Pick-up In Store (BOPIS) shopping experience can only be achieved because they have physical retail centers as well as an improving ecommerce platform.

They are able to source their items at closeout prices by dealing directly with manufacturers and vendors. This allows them to keep their prices lower than traditional discount retailers. As a result of the company‚Äôs focus on obtaining closeout prices for items net sales have increased year after year. In 2020 $BIG purchased 21% of their merchandise at cost directly from overseas vendors.

&#x200B;

[‚ÄúI love books‚Äù says Tommy who doesn‚Äôt know how to read.  ](https://preview.redd.it/7j7a50fr3o671.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d970620214cd76c518f3f08ff87f6665e579bbb4)

In 2020, $BIG began fulfilling direct-ship e-commerce orders from 47 store locations which were strategically located. In 2020, overall sales came from furniture, seasonal, soft home, food, consumables, hard home, electronics, toys & Accessories.

Big Lots also offers customers incentives to continue shopping at their company through the BIG rewards program. This program provides coupons and incentives for customers and encourages new membership. Through the beginning of 2021, the BIG rewards program had nearly 21 million active members. The value presented in this base of membership cannot be overstated; incentivizing customers to keep coming back by providing discounts for further purchases all but ensures that they will be retaining their core customers.

**Financial Overview ‚Äì**

The company is in a strong financial position as 2020 was its best year.

¬∑ Net sales increased $876 million, or 16.5%.

¬∑ Diluted earnings per share increased 161.5% to $16.11 per share compared with $6.16 per share in 2019.

¬∑ **Cash and cash equivalents increased to $559.6 million.**

¬∑ **$BIG acquired 3.8 million of its outstanding shares for $172.8 under the 2020 repurchase authorization program.**

¬∑ **Paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.30 a share.**

**Operation North Star ‚Äì**

In 2019 $BIG completed an initial review of its operating strategy. This resulted in a multi-year plan for strategic transformation called ‚ÄúOperation North Star.‚Äù

Operation North Star has 3 primary objectives:

**1. Drive profitable long-term growth**

a. Strengthen the offerings in the furniture, seasonal and soft home merchandise categories.

b. Grow $BIG brands such as Broyhill

c. Grow store count

d. Grow e-commerce sales

**2. Fund the journey**

a. Expand gross margin rate

b. Increase organizational efficiency

c. Continuously analyze purchasing habits and vendor agreements to ensure the company is maximizes buying power and makes cost-effective decisions

**3. Create long-term shareholder value**

**a. Executing the first two objectives of Operation North Star will deliver value to shareholders through earnings growth over time.**

&#x200B;

[‚ÄúHoney we‚Äôre going to need a bigger cart‚Äù  ](https://preview.redd.it/4dq868e64o671.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f90b7b5310332919c37f24212c3e9212db5f96d2)

**Share repurchase program** ‚Äì

¬∑ When looking into the financials of Big Lots there is a trend that dates back to 2005. Back in 2005 they had 115 million shares outstanding and as of 2021 they currently only have 39 million shares outstanding. I found this to be of particular interest when considering shareholder value, typically as time goes on the shares outstanding of a company tend to increase but in the case of Big Lots the company has a consistent record of buying back their own shares. This reflects in their earnings per share as it was $0.21 in 2005 and now is a whopping $16.11.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Big Lots ($BIG) is an underappreciated undervalued company that has a market capitalization of $2.5 billion while its competitors are valued at hundreds of billions. $BIG has been profitable every year for over a decade and has a strong balance sheet.

Position: 2x 72.5c exp. 7/16 & 5x $80c exp. 7/16

2021-06-21 22:38:49,wallstreetbets,I was looking at the multi-year trend on yahoo finance.  Total debt in 2019 was $518M.  Seems like a really big increase.  3x debt in just 2 years.  Someone posted yesterday on Norwegian Cruise lines and it was the same way.  It nearly doubled to $12B in a year.  Stock looked cheap relative to pre-covid but some of these companies will be digging out of debt for awhile.

Hello again WSB,

If you're reading this, I want you to be aware that this post is not about WISH, and I'm not sorry for that. It is also not financial advice. I'm fucking tired today due to norco beating back tooth pain, so this isn't going to contain much in the way of jabs at the absolutely retarded things that have taken place here in the past week or so. I will say, though, that the people buying into PRPL are special...

Basics:

* Corsair Gaming Inc
* CRSR
* Revenue $1.7B

As strong a buy rating as you can get, pretty much. The upside on the price targets is pretty universal as well with a minimum upside of 15% and a max of 72% (estimated, of course). I think pretty much everyone in the market knows that this is going to go up, even without the meme fuckery that took place. 

There is no play here involving (opposite of ""tall"") or gamma or any other kind of (really tight grip). This is a pure value play with growth potential...

# ""So why is it interesting? Get out of here you boomer ass bitch."" Fair - two reasons though, retard...

1. The obvious growth potential (70% potential not good enough?)
2. **The seemingly consistent chart to play with in the meantime...**

Since taking this screen grab, it's gone up a little bit as well. Ignoring the retard spike that just took place, you can see that this is in an upward channel. We're not talking about some of these idiotic posts that show a ""channel"" for a couple of days or something. This is months of activity here driving a consistency seen similarly in stocks like ASO and CLF. 

If I set my target line at $35, because I like $35 strike for mid/shortish term calls, I can see that I've had multiple opportunities in this recent trading pattern to bank in the money. The potential meme spike reoccurrence is just a bonus, honestly, and I won't complain about it. 

# Bonus section: earnings beats

Just to add some fuel to the growth fire here, a company less than 1 year out of IPO posting not only profitability, but also major beats for a couple of quarters. Sales aren't slowing down across retail and especially electronics retail (I'll throw another bone to ASO here too and mention outdoor retail booming).

# TL;DR again - this stock fucks. If you like what you see, buy some shares and play with options on this growth/value play. Try to generate some bags rather than hold them. Forecasts, earnings beats, and growing sales all point toward higher price.

Obviously, this depends on your risk tolerance, but this is one of those situations where it wouldn't be difficult to justify.

At more than 10% of your portfolio in shares of one company, you MIGHT actually be able to better balance your investment somewhat with a replacement strategy since you could get a contract that gives you the ( effective ) equivalent of 100 shares for less than you paid for your 50.

Obviously, this is not financial advice.  Just something to consider.  Good luck."

2021-06-22 07:28:09,wallstreetbets,It's not undervalued if there is selling pressure of half the existing shares. That's calculated and adjusts the value of the share price. Liquidity and ownership matters. If you want to ignore it and look at the p/e then you're willfully ignorant.

It is undervalued by every metric and eagletrees selling may be nearly over with if they want to retain majority control for the time being.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why $SOFI Ss An Absolute Steal Of a Lifetime Right Now Listen up, take your Adderal, and tell your wife's boyfriend to shut up.

&#x200B;

**What is SOFI?**

 SoFi provides a suite of financial products that include student loan refinancing, mortgages, personal loans, credit cards, investing, and banking. Not to mention they have their own brokerage platform, with options trading coming soon. And they also have great fucking customer service to keep people coming back time and time again.

**Why is $SOFI being so heavily shorted?**

$SOFI going public through a SPAC deal already made it heavily shorted based on a crackdown by the SEC. With a short volume ratio of 25.32%, it is one of the most shorted stocks on the market right now meaning you can get a great discount.

**Galileo.**

Galileo a company SOFI purchased for $1.2 billion is a payment processor with customers like Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Revolut, Varo, and TransferWise. Google Cloud executive Derek White is joining the board as CEO with more than 20 years of experience in financial services replacing Clay Wilkes. Galileo in recent news just signed a deal with Verizon to provide a teen card. In a field, with companies like Stripe it's doing quite well with revenue increasing 97% first half of 2020, and their new launch Galileo Instant saw more than 1500 small businesses signup within the first six months.

**Stripe.** 

Stripe has had an amazing year and things are only getting better. Sofi after buying Golden Pacific Bancorp will expedite its process to a bank charter allowing it to take deposits and allowing it to offer lower interest rates on loans. Analyst Sean Horgan said that SoFi possesses ""a powerful cost advantage over incumbents which will lead to dramatic disintermediation over the next 5-10 years, leaving substantial primary bank accounts, revenues, and market value up for grabs."" Not to mention that Rosenblatt gave it a $30 price target for you retards that's $8 a share in gains from current prices. And with SOFI stadium being a new staple in LA it's bound to boost sales, and forgot to mention that Cramer likes the stock and their brokerage directly competes with Robinhood. The stock is very much reminiscent of SQ in its earlier days. Currently, they do $547 million in revenue with member growth in the most recent quarter topping 110%, and with an estimated $2.4 billion in gross proceeds from their merger, they have all the funding they need.

**TLDR**

Cramer likes the stock so you should too. Referring to it as the trifecta of fintech as Square, PayPal, and SoFi.

EDIT: Just in, Cramer hates this stock."

2021-06-22 02:46:15,wallstreetbets,"Imagine not understanding valuation multiples. Would you compare Walmart‚Äôs multiple to SoFi‚Äôs? You cannot compare SoFi‚Äôs to Blend, which derives nearly all of its revenue from SaaS sales. SoFi does not sell software. 

Instead you can look at the revenue of all of Blend‚Äôs *customers,* because that‚Äôd be a closer comparison to SoFi, which acts as a bank. So let‚Äôs look at Wells Fargo‚Äôs revenue then.

WF: $72 billion
US Bank: $23.3 billion 

Just two of Blend‚Äôs hundreds of customers"
2021-06-22 02:05:45,wallstreetbets,Yeah great incentives for the CEO but they only brought in $90 million in revenue last year (SoFi brought in 5 times that)‚Ä¶. And if they processed roughly a third of the overall market in mortgages last year it‚Äôs not going to be a great earner like gallelio
2021-06-22 02:41:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes but you‚Äôre comparing SoFi‚Äôs bank-like revenue (like Rocket lmao) to Blend‚Äôs pure software sales revenue. 

You failed to read the link. They already process 1/3 of the entire US mortgage originations and their latest offering gives every single existing financial institution an opportunity to compete in the digital age *without having to employ their own software engineers like SoFi.* Blend is essentially giving traditional financial institutions a way out by outsourcing the development of their tech stack, and the latest consumer banking offering does payments and cards just like the touted Galileo does. 

Go look at Crunchbase or Pitchbook if you pay. They‚Äôve been oversubscribed every round of funding, every round has been an upround, and their valuation went from $.95B in spring of 2020 to $4.4B in spring of 2021.

I‚Äôm not a SoFi hater, I had over 100 contracts to include 7/16 $20c that printed after the merge. I‚Äôm just able to identify real headwinds. And I‚Äôm not an outsider looking in, I‚Äôm a B2B fintech product manager"
2021-06-22 06:53:49,wallstreetbets,"Okay so they processed 1/3 and aren‚Äôt making much revenue. So it looks as though there is not a lot of room for revenue growth, plus we are in a housing bubble rn

Plus it‚Äôs going through a traditional IPO so this will already be overpriced by the time it hits market and the peasants like me can get in on the action"
2021-06-22 14:41:59,wallstreetbets,"That wasn‚Äôt the point of any of this. Blend‚Äôs software gives traditional FIs the full stack tech they need - SoFi doesn‚Äôt have an edge against them now, and won‚Äôt by end of year when Blend‚Äôs consumer banking platform is widely adopted. SoFi‚Äôs consumer facing app will be no different than any bank‚Äôs or credit union‚Äôs 

Galileo will compete directly with Blend for customers (do you even understand what their API gateway is or does?). Here‚Äôs the kicker - said FIs that already use Blend‚Äôs software for mortgage will be more likely to use Blend‚Äôs software for credit cards and payments than Galileo because they would already be a vetted third party vendor that has gone through all of the respective FI‚Äôs internal risk management and third party management due diligence processes

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Broken Camera on BRAND NEW IPHONE reveals macro trend. First and foremost, I've been an apple customer since 2005. I like the ecosystem and have enjoyed apple products. 

REcently, My cameras just random went out on my iphone 12 pro 512gb phone. Ive been working with the apple support team after tmobile sent me there due to a warranty issue. So i chat with apple through support, they give me 3 options. self service, send in for repair or express replacement.  

I ask a lot of questions, because if i can go to a store (self service option) and get a new phone, it will be a lot faster than express replacement. 

(This issue is rather minute, yet when i researched how many people are having their cameras randomly fail on the iphone, i was really stunned). 

So i setup an appointment with Apple to go get a new phone under warranty. The ""Genius,"" at the genius bar informed me that Apple HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED THEIR SERVICE SYSTEMS.  Instead of issuing replacement devices, they have to repair every single device. They have to fix it there and give it back, they're not in the business of replacement devices any more. I still don't believe this, but if it is indeed true. Apple is screwd. 

Here is why apple is screwed. 

After asking this guy a bunch of calibrated questions to get him to bend.. he really wouldn't. So i said fine, fix my cameras. But How can we get this done fast? I own a business and depend on my phone to help all of our flight crew.  

He looked me in the eye and said they don't have the parts and cannot get them for a while. I mentioned how i've seen hundreds of posts on reddit and elsewhere... people who have the same problem that I do. 

&#x200B;

Why is it that Apple cannot get replacement parts? Is the supply chain that bad? 

When i see the scale of the issue by searching online, it really makes me wonder if Apple has caused themselves a serious bottleneck. 

1. They change service to repairs when possible dont' replace...
2. Can't get replacement parts
3. Leave people hanging. 

I know this seems like a hit piece on apple, but as i searched more and more. I realized i'm not jsut one guy with a broken iPhone. 

I'm one guy of 10's of thousands who have a phone more expensive than a laptop and no way to fix it. While this may take months to showcase a real problem over time. It really makes me want to dig into the numbers at apple. No wonder why they are so after service revenue. No repairs. 

Id rather just buy a blackberry and an iTouch and get teh same experience. At least the price will match the expectations."

You‚Äôre probably wondering why you should listen to some random guy on reddit who does not have diamond hands and doesn‚Äôt post regularly on this forum. Well, you shouldn‚Äôt. But you‚Äôre lazy and do not want to do your own research. I am not in finance by trade, in fact, I am more of a real estate analyst than anything but I took an interest in equities and have an entire library worth of books from the classics such as Buffet‚Äôs mentor Benjamin Graham, etc.. so of course you can take my word for it.

**What Macy‚Äôs is NOT.** **Why are the Shorts and Analysts‚Äô wrong?**

I came to write **about Why the Shorts have it wrong on this one.** **As of May 28th, It‚Äôs 17.8% short**!? Which I just do not understand. Besides the fact that they have a freaking awesome fireworks show on the Hudson river every year, they are basically an anchor tenant in every single mall. This is not JC Penny or Sears. **This company is holding 1.8 Billion in** **cash and not going anywhere**. Yes, malls have been on the beatdown because of the pandemic, but things are coming back and they‚Äôre coming back fast.

This is not just a GME type company who is going to benefit solely from the shorts being squeezed and forced to buy back their positions at a higher price. This is a company that has been around for a long time with a solid business model and fundamentals.

The 1st quarter for 2021, Macy‚Äôs beat out the earnings estimates from analysts by a huge margin yet a lot of them are still bearish on the company.  They reported their adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share which beat out Zack‚Äôs Analyst Consensus of -41 cents. The analysts‚Äô had it wrong then and they still have it wrong now. Macy‚Äôs has taken a beating this past month, which is a good thing if you want to buy the stock on the cheap.

**Pent up Demand for Shopping**

If you‚Äôre going to follow guys like Peter Lynch who talk about how you can beat wall-street just with your eyes. Go ahead and head down to your local Macy‚Äôs and see it for yourself. You have the information with your eyes before Wallstreet can enter those numbers on a spreadsheet. Have you been to any malls lately? If you haven‚Äôt, I‚Äôll tell you that they are absolutely packed.

Macy‚Äôs sales surged 56% year over-year last quarter yet sales are still down due to the pandemic so there is still room for upside. As offices re-open, people are going to start shopping again for their work clothes, etc. which is a key market for Macy‚Äôs.

Usually industry stocks move in lock-step with one another (a rising tide will lift all boats) and the retail sector is no exception. According to Zack‚Äôs Industry Rank, the retail segment ranks 9 out of 250 industries meaning retail is going to be in pretty good shape. Analysts are starting to warm up a little bit over the past month by revising the earnings‚Äô estimate for the stock but of course you‚Äôre going to want to get in earlier rather than later. They have revised the estimates from -19 cents to +13 cents per share for the quarter and from $0.76 cents to $2.15 per share for the year.

They have their Credit Card / Loyalty program, a major source of income for them, which added 1.7 million members. In addition to their retail operations with Macy‚Äôs, Bloomingdale‚Äôs, they are also investing heavily in their online segment which will be an additional area of growth/sales for them as their 47% of their 4.6 million new customers came in digitally.

EDIT: Also, the owner of the Carolina Panthers David Tepper bought in January.  I don't have Diamond Hands, but this dude sure does.

So all in all, not only am I supporting by buying stock, I‚Äôm also going to rack up some money on my Macy‚Äôs card.  What do you all think?

Disclosures: Do not own Macy‚Äôs stock but do plan to buy."
2021-06-21 23:31:09,wallstreetbets,"The fact that they don't know who Tepper is tells you everything you need to know. Shorts think amazon and e-commerce gonna kill department stores, so they've been pressing the position for a few years. They should realize it's 2021 i.e. not the time to press a short. Also  a lot of these old line retailers are expanding their omni channel capabilities so the short thesis may be invalidated. We'll see over the next 3-5 years."
2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMD already beyond the GALAXY... and Google is coming with a 1-2 punch!!! # Dear Apes,

# I've got more news... and frankly, it is beyond my wildest dreams.

We  had **TESLA** loving AMD, adopting their APUs & GPUs in the MODELS X  and S, and an optional for other vehicles. This pushes AMD to MARS... as  autonomous driving is a perfect for gaming.

We  had **Google** signing a contract to adopt Milan Epyc Datacenter CPUs for virtual machine offerings... SMOKING intel. HUGE DATACENTER WIN, as the TCO is dropped dramatically.

We had the 6900XTX Liquid Cooled breaking **World Records** (previously held by the 6900XT).

We have **Valve** releasing a new handheld with AMD by the holiday season 2021.

We have **Fidelity FX Super Resolution** with AMAZING FPS boosts in Ultra Quality and Quality modes (launching **tomorrow**).

We  have the AMD Advantage Program for LAPTOPS allowing for a 5900HX (TOP  mobile CPU) to be paired with a RX 6800M, an VALUE HIGH-END mobile GPU.  Giving Mobile 3080 like performance at $1650, with high refresh monitor  (300Hz on 1080p to 140Hz on 1440p).

But now... it is **Samsung**'s latest info.

We knew AMD was coming in the Galaxy S22.... but it gets BETTER!!!

The  performance of RDNA2 in mobile is **beating expectations**... and SAMSUNG  is signing a future deal with AMD... as they are **SUPER PLEASED** with  AMD's performance. Samsung will effectively ABANDON their GPU plans and  work with AMD going forward.

But that IS NOT ALL.... **GOOGLE** also wants AMD in their Mobiles.

Google, the **Android** software developer... wants AMD. This is NUTS.

To summarize,

**AUTONOMOUS DRIVING:**

Huge Partnership with TELSA for GPU's and APU's. More manufacturers to join soon!

**GAMING (Consoles & PC):**

Consoles: PS5, Xbox X/S, Valve handheld, Aya Neo.

PC (CPU): Zen3 with stacked cache coming late this year (15% IPC expected). Zen4 in Q2 2022.

PC (GPU): 6900XTX, 6800M available. Fidelity FX SR tomorrow!!! RDNA3 MCM coming next year.

**DATACENTER:**

Goggle wants Milan Epyc for Virtual Machine service offerings. Tencent and Alibaba coming next!

Datacenter chips with 128 Cores (256 threads) coming next year!!!

**MOBILE (phones):**

AMD making a HUGE entrance into the Samsung Galaxy with RDNA2. Google wants AMD too!!!

AMD is now officially EVERYWHERE. From ""El Capitan"" Dept. of Energy to **EVERY popular gaming hardware & software solution**.... including mobile phones.

This was the last catalyst... the stock will now retest the $81.70... and surge towards $130.

Xilinx has been given a Green Light by all major regulators.

# MILKY WAY HERE WE COME!!!

2021-06-21 20:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Again, they have the 6900XT which has set world records.

There's also the 6900XTX, just launched, available only from system integrators.

This GPU is stronger and more powerful than a 3090.

But AMD has even gone beyond NVIDIA's discrete GPUs.

Namely, APUs, which can run graphics without needing a discrete GPU.

Less power, less space, smaller form factor, cheaper... the 5700G and 5600G coming out in early August.

Finally, they have the 6000 mobile GPUs with Smartshift and Smart Access Memory... beating NVIDIA. Look at the Asus G15 Advantage Edition, which is getting praise by reviewers. At $1650, you get a Ryzen 9 5900HX + Radeon RX 6800M/

Next year, it will be RDNA3... on MCM.

AMD will do to Nvidia what it has already done to Intel."
2021-06-22 00:39:40,wallstreetbets,"in which world is the 6900xtx more powerful than a 3090. you clearly don't know your shit because the 3090 has more memory and almost double the memory bandwidth thanks to 24 gb of gddr6x compared to amd's 16 gb of gddr6. Yes, there are a few games where even a 6800xt outpaces a 3090 because the game is more optimized for AMD but in most scenarios, the 3090 will smack the 6900xt. In productivity tasks for the graphics sector, AMD just can't compete. I'm not shitting on AMD, I love their products and competition but get your facts straight. Also, DLSS is better than FSR as FSR looks like dogshit in the demo as it isn't temporal (superior tech) like DLSS is (that's why DLSS sometimes looks even better than native resolution). It's pretty much just a shitty upscaler, that's why it's supported on a lot of products. I have big hopes for RDNA3 outpacing NVIDIA's Lovelace but most people will still prefer NVIDIA for the time being."
2021-06-22 03:44:08,wallstreetbets,"The use cases for when 16GB of VRAM is not enough and 24GB is enough are extremely narrow when you look at the market as a whole. A slice of the productivity market, maybe. Nvidia does have CUDA, which is also better for that. DLSS is great, but AMD takes the lead on more than just a few games at native resolution. (Modern Warfare, a game developed with Nvidia cards in mind with raytracing and whatnot, performs much better on AMD's offering than what I'm getting with my 3090 at native resolution) 

 I'm saying this as I use my 3090. The 3090 is the better GPU right now, I guess, but the 6800XT and 6900XT is the better product for your money. The point is that AMD's trajectory is scary for Nvidia. In only 2 generations, AMD went from mostly budget cards to having the better value product in every price bracket I can think of, including the top end. What's exciting is that the rate of change for innovation seems to be much greater on AMD's side, present marginal advantages Nvidia may currently have notwithstanding."
2021-06-22 07:54:53,wallstreetbets,Indeed. Good points!
2021-06-22 08:04:01,wallstreetbets,"For the money, yeah AMD is miles better espescially with the pricing on ebay. Where I‚Äôm at a 6800xt is half the price of a 3080. Strange world we live in. I‚Äôm excited for AMD‚Äôs next generation of GPU‚Äôs and CPU‚Äôs as there will be many advancements (eg. new CPU socket with DDR5 support, 2nd gen ray accelerators, TSMC 5nm for both CPU‚Äôs and GPU‚Äôs). as a long term growth stock, this is a great buy imo. I‚Äôll hopefully get profits from my 100 shares in $WISH and then buy shares in $AMD before it shoots up."

i've been buying equity to compliment my options etc, and Ive been impressed with my returns so far.  That being said, nothing is actually affecting $X Negatively from social media and at this point it is just a hedge fund dump.

  
Since they cleared a lot of the debt on their books as well, everything is really looking like a solid bet for equity and calls..  Anyone interested helping drive away hedge funds?

Analysis to follow:

&#x200B;

is that i think that we have an interesting opportunity.  With the market worried about china and others releasing reserves into the market, there was a dump across minerals.  Across the year, it has been making great progress since I thought US Steel was fairly undervalued.  Right now, you see it had a hiccup with a Double Top on the monthly, but when it retakes 22.60, it is pretty much free burn to orbit.  I dont mind other insights, but ive been happy so far with them through the last 6 months."
2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"API - Quick Analysis Some thoughts on API. No position yet. Want to see what you guys think. 

>*API*

**Industry attractiveness**

\- RTE adoptions among Twitter, Spotify, Facebook

\- Unverified rumors - Greenroom (Spotify) is built using API

**Market bears misconceptions** 

\- tying API to Clubhouse (Clubhouse sign up has slowed down drastically)

\- tying API to the Chinese Education sector (going through regulation reform, 35% revenue in danger)

**Competitive Dynamics**

\- RTE (Agora business) doesn't use CDN which could provide better communication when networks/sites are down. The problem surfaced during recent Airline & bank websites went down due to major internet failure. Brad Altfest (Agora Director of BD posted a message around how Agora can help bank and airline prevent such risks in the future)

\- Agora's new App Builder - zero coding and suitable for firms looking to have their own branded Zoom Calls.

**Key developments**

\- New partnership with HP. Felt like an early version of ROKU when it first partnered with TV manufactures

\- [Symbl.ai](https://Symbl.ai) can transcript [Agora.io](https://Agora.io) stream into transcripts. A live demo code can be found here

[https://github.com/symblai/symbl-agora-demo-app](https://github.com/symblai/symbl-agora-demo-app)

\- Acquisition of Netless - The White-SDK from Netless is a cross-platform, real-time, interactive whiteboard solution. 

\- partnership with HTC for VIVE to accelerate the adoption of VR innovation in real-time engagement

The market is focusing on what Agora is doing now (Education, clubhouse), I felt maybe it's time to move in and focus on the next round - ROKU-like strategy and invading the mission-critical operations now relying on the internets."

As I write the title for this DD I can't help but cringe a little bit at the thought of receiving a purple nurple. Its probably been years since I've been the victim of one but the emotional scars are still there. $PRPL gang has been in a deep hibernation for months now even sleeping thru the great meme wars. Purple is a undervalued company with tremendous upside in the coming months.

**TLDR:**

* $PRPL is currently trading at 1.8x this years projected sales
* Analysts are projecting strong earnings growth for the next two years, with 14% and 28% EPS growth estimates for 2021 and 2022
* PRPL is planning on becoming the #2 player in the sleep industry and is projecting \~1.5B\~2B in revenue- with this move expected to take 3-5 years
* It is currently trading in the $25-27 range and 3 times it has traded in that range the past year it has bounced big

The Company

Purple Innovation designs and manufacture mattresses, pillows. Purple is a leader in comfort technology, they designs and manufactures products to improve how people sleep, sit, and stand. It offers cushions, pillows, and other comfort products using its proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology. All products are focused on the company's vision to improve comfort for people. Purple continues to be a disruptor to the traditional mattress industry with its innovative products, packaging and shipping, direct-to-consumer sales, and generous trial and return policies. In my humble opinion some of Purple's product lineup should hit home for some of you autists. Purple is trying to make some of you computer goblins not look like the hunchback of Notre Dame so you might be able to get some bitches without having to show them your portfolio balance.

Financials

Q1 2021 Revenue 186.43M Net Income 20.82 Profit Margin 11.17%

Q1 2021 Total Assets 566.77M Total Liabilities 409.23 Debt to Assets 19.19%

From $200M to $648M in 2020. Operating margin has improved from negative to positive territory, to 5.7% at present.

Due to the housing boom of 2020-21 people bought lots of new mattresses and pillows this resulted in a 2020 net revenue increasing 51% YoY to $649M. Gross margin improved as well from 44.1% in 2019 to 47% in 2020 due to lower input costs.

Last year direct-to-consumer revenue increased by 83%, and wholesale revenue had a slight increase as well.

For all you smooth brains who can't leave a tip at a restaurant without pulling out the calculator app on your phone these numbers good.

üì∑

Upcoming Catalysts & Growth

As Purple continues to grow and expand their profit margins and sales the company becomes more and more undervalued at their current price point. PRPL believes 50% of the market opportunity is outside of the USA. They are not currently focusing on oversea expansion but will pivot to there in the coming years when every single mattress in America is ruled under the iron fist of $PRPL. Another upcoming catalyst will be their hosting of a virtual investor and analyst session on June 29, 2021. This will hopefully give some more insight to the growth projections for the company and could spur new investor interest as well. Many analysts are very bullish on $PRPL with the median price targets in the mid 30's.

üì∑

Technicals

At the time of writing this post $PRPL currently trades at $26.5 with a market cap of 1.98 B. As I stated earlier it has been locked into this 25-27 range and once it breaks out big movements could be on the horizon. I see big upside for this stock going into the summer and I am very bullish on the current price point. August and July calls have IV's in the 60's right now. Those are the main calls I will be focusing on.

2021-06-22 10:40:43,wallstreetbets,"I get that a lot of people don't like Wish... I don't either.  But the numbers don't lie.  It's currently a successful company.  And even if it weren't, it didn't make any sense to be down over 50% from IPO.  It didn't lose half its value in a couple months.

The vast majority of stocks I trade, I have never used the company.  I've also never used Ali Baba, Tencent, etc., but those are hugely successful.  Wish is multinational like them and can have successful markets in other countries.  I've also never owned a Volkswagen.  I've never even touched a Tesla before.  Yet guess what... My experiences and tastes have nothing to do with a company's long term prospects... And certainly not their short term trade potential.

This run with Wish has legs because they were undervalued.  It will spike, and then sell down to a fair value after earnings in August.  Until some new sales & MAU data points come out, Wish's stock trajectory is likely up or sideways.  We should have until August ER at least, and I plan to utilize the opportunity.

Edit: Pretty sure I've never owned a Blackberry product, either.  Nor have I ever liked their products."

The problem I have developed reading people's posts on here is how many people continue to buy at the top expecting it to make a higher run.  Everyone adds to their post to do your own DD but the truth is people just buy hype.  Yes, you are likely right that it will continue to run a little higher over multiple months with multiple pull backs, but most of the run is over for a period of time."
2021-06-22 11:04:35,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I think it's got enough behind it to make it to $16 as support, with some occasional rising above that and dipping back down.  I personally wouldn't buy here, but I am holding here.  I'll probably exit at $16... But this thing has enough hype and volume right now that I could be way off and it could fly to $30.  That would certainly be irrational, but I've watched plenty of stocks rise to irrational heights over the years.

I think the people buying in now will be okay, I just agree with you that I wouldn't personally buy here.  It's a hold for me now, and I sold 2/3 of my calls on that pop this morning as well.  I'll probably sell the rest on the next pop and then just hold my shares for ~$16."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why did the 2-year yield jump when the FED was more hawkish in the last speech? When last week the FED announced they will start increasing the FED Funds Rates earlier than previously expected, the [2-year yield](https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/u.s.-2-year-bond-yield) jumped from 0.16% to 0.27%. I understand that expectations of rates increases, increased the rates, but is this move is justified?

&#x200B;

The FED said they forecast the first increase somewhere in 2023. This means that the first increase may be between 18 and 24 months away. Therefore, buying a 2-year bond now doesn't cause any ""missed higher interest rate"" because the bond likely reached (or almost reached) maturity by the time rates are increased. To explain more clearly: if I buy a 2-year bond now and the interest rates are increased in 6 months, for 1.5 years I lose the higher interest rate. However, is the rates are going to be increased in 2 years, I'm not losing the higher interest rate as the bond will have reached maturity by the time.

&#x200B;

I thought one possible explanation is the fact that the FED may slow down their bonds purchases. However, this is expected to be just 10B per month starting in Jan-22. Given the amount of money still lent back to the FED through the [Reverse Repurchase Agreements](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp) (765B on June 21), 10B would be easily adsorbed by the market, and, other than that, a 0.16% would be still better than the current 0.05% available on the Reverse Repurchase agreement with the FED.

&#x200B;

I also thought the reason could just be that the market expects rates to be increase much earlier than 2023 and this seems the most plausible explanation, which would also be validated that by looking at the [Eurodollar Futures prices](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/stir/eurodollar_quotes_globex.html), where the first interest rate increase is forecasted to be in the May-22 meeting.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street failed to shake Amarin's Vascepa. Amarin tried but it seems Generics are the new greedy pharma. From a health point of view I see this as a failure to keep people healthy. J&J suspected the in-active ingredient in the vaccine to be causing the blood clots. Imagine if Hikma generic has a similar in-active ingredient among its 20% fluctuations. This is a medication to protect the heart and the vascular system. It is not a headache med.   All what Amrn needs to do when it comes to the USA market is to keep an eye on the infringements and nail them with powerful law suits. The generic is not that much cheaper any way. I don't think educated insured patients should go for the generics and I don't think pharmacies or physicians should conspire with the generic.  The SC decision is not that impactful on the share price negative wise. It could have helped the shorts with a good news bounce. It is a very stable company with no debt and world-wide market awaiting.  


Background:

 Vascepa is an FDA approved drug to decrease Cardiovascular risks such as heart attacks and strokes. Vascepa is protected by 60 patents listed by the FDA. Once it hit the market, HIKMA a generic giant jumped in to harvest the market and infringe beyond the thin label granted for the generic. A federal court ruling in 2020 invalidated 6 key patents for Amarin/Vascepa. Today the case is at the Supreme Court and decision will be made about whether to re-validate the patents and stop the infringement or let the un-tested generic swamp the market and compete the validated medication out. In my opinion this is both not fair and dangerous. Dangerous because the generic is not clinically validated, the in-active ingredients side effects are not known and the stability. The public only knows that the generic is slightly cheaper and ignore the rest.

The Supreme Court failed to rectify the course of justice by dismissing Amarin's patents hearing. This might pave the road for generics to harvest the hard work and the results of years of clinical trials and geopardize safety standards. Generics are allowed by the FDA to have up to 20% variation margin in their products and that the in-active ingredients in the generics are not clinically tested or proved harmless. A cheap medication that harms is more costly than a brand name that is fully tested and approved."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WISH is pretty much a sure thing (eCommerce pro's opinion) **Not financial advice** (Possible dd from an insider here. The insider being me. Not a Wish insider, an eCommerce one)


Listen up apes!

I work in eCommerce (business of buying and selling bananas online) and can tell you that Contex Logic aka Wish.com is a strong contender to be our Chinese Amazon.

Does anyone remember how they first positioned themselves when they launched? Fun, cheap novelty things from China. That's not the heart of their business. That's just the fun thing that they advertise to people to get them in.

Enter Wish Express. Wish express is a program that sellers have to adhere to when it comes to shipping times. Basically it will mirror the Walmart shipping speed (3-5 business days). This shipping speed makes it a contender.

So if Wish is so great, why is the stock price so fucking low? Great question voice in my head. FIVE Words: Covid killed global supply chains. Once supply chain speed returns to normal, Wish will pick up. 

You will almost always see an increase in stock price if if we're getting near BF / Cyber Mon, or Prime Day (today).

Wish's ""secret sauce"" lies in their algorithmic pricing. Wish will push you a price that you are more likely to purchase at based on the data it has gathered from you. That's why the site is pretty much locked until you sign up. 

So let's say I'm the seller and you're the buyer. I list a product for $100 with free shipping. If it sees that you don't usually buy products at that price point, it'll drop the price (without fucking telling the seller, but that's a story for another day) and offer it at 89.99 with let's say 9.99 shipping. Same amount, different structure. All based on consumer psychology and machine learning. 

Wish also has a TON of data / kpi's for sellers. And it has a ton of cool marketing tools for us as well.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$MYRG dive MYRG, aka MYR Group, is a construction engineering company up 242% in the last 5 years, but it's not done. EPS growth has approximately matched share growth of 30% per year for the last 5 years. Recent improvements in TSR also likely indicate the business itself is getting better with time. There is every reason to believe the earnings growth as well as share price growth will continue to increase at the current rate, or perhaps more.

Zacks Investment research would concur that the stock is strong with a recent upgrade to Strong Buy given the current price. Zacks model predicts that the earnings will actually outperform estimates, which would shoot the share price up even more.

And for the waves of new autist investors that only care about small market cap moonshots, the MC is a mere 1.5 billion üöÄüöÄüöÄ

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC what a STONK This stock has great earnings power and its fundamentals are stronger than my erection when looking at its potential dividend payments!

I don't get why UWMC is not getting the traction, it is simply a great company. Its forecast to earn around $1 a share this year and this is expected to increase year on year. This leads on to potential increases in the dividend pay-outs and share buyback options. Plans have already been announced to buy back $300 million of stock. The company is a great buy and whilst your waiting for take off to the moon you can be sipping champagne with your quarterly dividend pay-out. It turns over a healthy profit and the last half of its ticker is the same as $AMC.

What is there for us retards not to love!!"

2021-06-22 12:01:23,wallstreetbets,"I dumped this stock a couple of weeks ago. I learned that one of the posts promoting it on here was fake. It was a totally fake and fictitious screenshot. It freaked me out and I sold for like a 4% loss. Glad I dumped when I did. I think this is a pretty good company and everything, for sure. But I think there's been a lot of manipulation with this stock and I just don't trust it one bit right now."

2021-06-21 23:28:28,wallstreetbets,Corporate shill here made 80% returns with 7-10% percent dividends. What am I missing witb this stock? I work transportation for a fairly large investing firm named Berkshire Hathaway loz
2021-06-21 21:32:58,wallstreetbets,"They make more than enough money to pay the dividend.  In that sense it's reliable.

Next Q they are projected to earn less than 10c / share due to extremely low margins.  The environment causing the low margins is not expected to last.  But if it does last eventually the dividend has to be cut.

I don't foresee problems here... the margin is low because they initiated a price war to try to win more market share and maintain their high volume when there is just less business out there to compete for.  In the end they will crush the competition because their superior tech gives them lower costs than anyone else, and they close faster.  If they are making 1%, no one is going to be able to match them without losing money."
2021-06-22 09:21:41,wallstreetbets,"If they cut the dividend without some big growth numbers I can see tons of people fleeing the stock.  That being said, I‚Äôm long 100 shares and selling CCs to make my own ‚Äúdividend‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt see this stock flying to the moon any time soon because of the uncertainty of the housing market, but gamblers could run this shit up short term with a bit of WSB traction."
2021-06-22 12:45:28,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm poor and currently holding about 150 shares but that is like 1/6 of my portfolio.
2021-06-21 20:16:32,wallstreetbets,"This sounds glorious, good luck to us!"
2021-06-21 21:51:01,wallstreetbets,"The point here is that UWMC offers better rates than a bank.  Refi vs purchase is irrelevant.  If you go Wells Fargo or even Rocket directly you are just going to pay more than you will pay if you go to a mortgage broker.  That's the whole point.

The banks will still make money (they actually do the lending) but UWMC will own the origination.

Also, I used to think that refis would drop off as rates rise but now I'm having my doubts.  Housing prices are going up so much that I think we are seeing a lot of 2nd morgages or cash-out refis.   So the drop-off might not be as severe as you might expect, or at least it might take longer than people thought to play out.

Also there is a lot of pent-up demand, so new purchase originations should make up some of the slack when refis fall, at least for a couple of quarters.

Predicting any further than that out is hard.  While it's true that you won't see the same numbers you saw in Q3 - Q4 ever again (or at least for a very long time) I think that UWMC is undervalued even if you look at more ""normalized"" earnings.

Everything is a good long term play... at the right price.  I believe that we are well below that price."

2021-06-22 09:24:57,wallstreetbets,"Even if rates rise and refinancing slows down, the housing market is red hot.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why you should pay attention to this organization , clover health investments ( CLOV ) . Clover Health operates as a next-generation Medicare Advantage insurer , which leverages Clover‚Äôs flagship software platform , the Clover Assistant , to provide America‚Äôs seniors with highly affordable , ‚Äú obvious ‚Äù healthcare plans .

By empowering physicians with data - driven , personalized insights at the point of care through the Clover Assistant platform , Clover strives to improve clinical decision - making and outcomes .

They also have their own email for contacting investors on their official website "" Investor Relations / Clover Health "" if you have any questions , please contact them , they also have information about their company's shares on the same site .

Medicare Advantage membership was approximately 66,300 as of March 31,2021 , an 18% increase from March 31,2020 .

Total revenue was $ 200.3 million in the first quarter of 2021 , a 21% increase compared to $ 165.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 .

This growth was primarily due to an increase in membership .

Salaries and benefits plus General and administrative expenses for the quarter were $ 104.6 million compared to $ 50.0 million for the first quarter of 2020 , an increase of $ 54.6 million .

This increase was related primarily to an increase in non - cash stock - based compensation expense related to stock awards that were issued to certain executives in connection with the Company's merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp .

III on January 7 , 2021 ( the "" Merger "" ) .

GAAP net loss for the quarter was $ ( 48.4 ) million compared to $ ( 28.2 ) million for the first quarter of 2020 .

Our first quarter 2021 results were impacted by the application of updated guidance from the SEC related to our accounting for public and private placement warrants assumed by the Company in connection with the Merger .

Applying the updated guidance , we recognized a gain of $ 85.5 million in the first quarter related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability .

Adjusted EBITDA loss ( Non - GAAP ) for the quarter was $ (76.2) million compared to $ (21.7) million in the first quarter of 2020 .

Normalized Adjusted EBITDA loss ( Non - GAAP ) , which excludes the net impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic and any changes to our estimate of prior period revenue and medical costs , was $ ( 52.1 ) million .

Cash , cash equivalents and investments totaled $ 720.1 million as of March 31 , 2021 .

The Merger delivered approximately $ 670 million to the Company‚Äôs balance sheet , net of deal - related expenses .

Financial forecast of their organization :

For full year 2021 .

Medicare Advantage membership is expected to be in the range of 68,000 - 70,000 by December 31 , 2021 , a growth rate of 17% - 21% as compared to year end 2020 .

This is consistent with our previous guidance that we discussed in our year - end 2020 earnings call on March 1 .

For the Medicare Direct Contracting program , while the Company expects to have access to up to 200,000 Medicare beneficiaries through its contracts with Participating Providers , we believe we will end 2021 with between 70,000 - 100,000 total aligned beneficiaries .

Voluntary alignment will occur quarterly , and the majority of voluntary alignments are expected to become effective in the fourth quarter .

Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $ 810 - $ 830 million , inclusive of a preliminary estimate of approximately $ 20 - $ 30 million of revenue generated from Direct Contracting .

GAAP revenue estimates for Direct Contracting are dependent on the finalization of accounting treatment , which we expect will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021 .

CMS benchmark expenditures under management for Direct Contracting are expected to be in the range of $ 700 - $ 800 million .

Total Medicare spend under management , which includes revenues from the Medicare Advantage program plus the estimated CMS benchmark expenditures for Direct Contracting , is expected to be in the range of $ 1.5 - $ 1.6 billion .

Adjusted Operating Expenses ( Non - GAAP ) , which we define as Salaries and benefits plus General and administrative expenses less stock - based compensation expense , is expected to be between $ 250 and $ 270 million , reflecting the use of a portion of the proceeds from the Merger to make investments in marketing , network expansion and technology to support future growth .

**I‚Äôll try to keep this simple without any over explanation, lots of pictures.**

1. **May 13th, 2021 - Funds Holding $CPNG via 13F filings (whalewisdom)**

[Big Boy Accumulation](https://preview.redd.it/kzjqahb89n671.png?width=2004&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2f843e058c10a61615da7d2333fa63e715fbbe6)

They post ‚Äúoperating loss‚Äù but it is not really a loss.

Why?

&#x200B;

[Cash is used = \\""negative\\""](https://preview.redd.it/yolkx9ge9n671.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=8adc41b791f832a7ffe790e137c9571310de8820)

Cash is used to 1) expand inventory and 2) to expand business.

Coupang Inc is an ‚ÄúAmazon,‚Äù an e-commerce store.

Cash is used and is shown as a negative.

Profit = Tax

Loss = Expansion

Why pay tax when it is better to expand business?

Financial news basically pushed the ‚Äúnet loss‚Äù without actually explaining it. Why?

Selling = lower cost basis

&#x200B;

3. **May 13th, 2021 - Cost Distribution and Option Snapshot**

[\\""Push it down\\""](https://preview.redd.it/uqmb2ghi9n671.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fe1ffe2a77d013e8b0d4627621553e12ddb042c)

Financial news successfully induced fear to push price below average cost of $52.87 to low of \~$30.

&#x200B;

$35P Breakeven $30.8

$45P Breakeven $31.70

The calls/puts were accumulated prior and the counterparty to the obligation wanted to push it down.

&#x200B;

[Short volume increased and pushed it down](https://preview.redd.it/9dwbwl4p9n671.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c5181201f64b7163835d0f18da8ee5c30ad36a8)

Short volume increased to 20% < 30% within the same time price action decreased.

Simultaneously option open interest increases at longer/higher timeline/strikes.

[Cheaper calls? \\""Fuck Yes.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/zz4p5r3x9n671.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc70e9823ff43318964d94b42257df53859eb707)

4. **November 19th, 2021 Option Expiration**

Both Call and Put Sweep on April 9th, 2021 (Spot was $45 at the time)

[After the sweep price was surpassed\/shorted as shown prior](https://preview.redd.it/os10bk43an671.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=65af59c9bcdbf9a28590ef05b2731344f0388530)

$50 CALL STRIKE | Open Interest 13,932

$40 PUT STRIKE | Open Interest 19,434

Opinion: Someone had the intention to manipulate price down, sold/wrote calls and bought/long puts to offset equity selling/shorting. Also, I think that the put premium was too extreme. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù wanted to try and squeeze out the puts into closing.

The **CALL** counterparty wants to push price down.

The **PUT** counterparty wants price up.

***Basically, once the sweep occurred, short volume spiked and resulted in price tanking from $40s to $30s.***

**5.** **UPDATE on November 19th, 2021 Expiration (Today is June 21st, 2021)**

[Still here \(bullish\)](https://preview.redd.it/wgsktn48an671.png?width=2796&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad37de78fa08596a1094d3e89909d3ca04d2f7f)

**Open interest remains elevated.**

What does this mean?

It means that there is no liquidity for the counterparty to get out of their position. The only thing they can do is hope to suppress price until expiration and let time value work for them.

It also means calls are still bullish and the counterparty to the puts are willing to accumulate stock.

&#x200B;

6. J**anuary 23rd, 2023 Option Expiration**

[Calls are bullish.](https://preview.redd.it/9l923w7dan671.png?width=1789&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfc05dd16e612f36f6f08fb60df21a5043e94d11)

7. **Last Fridays Expiration - June 18th, 2021**

On May 27th, 2021, price held $41.

Why?

They needed it down as the counterparty was bleeding on premiums for the calls at $35 and $40 strike.

**In essence, the reason why Coupang Inc. hasn‚Äôt taken off and is down is because the sentiment is so bullish.**

&#x200B;

[Longer Timeframe Same Story](https://preview.redd.it/wepwxq7man671.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=94cd088c7b3bfaac240aa8f465c7ac4d9887d692)

And the option interest is relatively unchanged today, still bullish.

[Still bullish.](https://preview.redd.it/9f2nibdpan671.png?width=2800&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3be7a4a799213710a7dde1b478e3ec0952df66)

**8. 130% Ownership?**

The data might not be accurate, but it seems this stock has been overbought 130%?

[They like the stock.](https://preview.redd.it/pjjt7bluan671.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=e27c9d8384c0e6c1eeca0a07df3cf6123e889ac9)

[So much.](https://preview.redd.it/8oa4qdewan671.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f92936f33ef7ce9d80167221b7d51c08c624d6)

And... with a huge put/call ratio of 0.14

Shares Outstanding: 1,700,000,000

3.741 x 1,000,000 x 100 = 374,100,000 shares(contracts) bullish

[So maybe options are extremely bullish.](https://preview.redd.it/h8h8zs9zan671.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=2148aaffaf61fc0865b9d740ed329acada905fc4)

With the recent headline news (headline risk) of the fire and CEO stepping down to focus on global expansion into Japan and Singapore.

It seems the narrative is trying to suppress price because *something isn‚Äôt right.*

The counterparty to the calls are either naked or covered.

Covered = 1) Get assigned away premature valuation, 2) buy back contracts at a loss, or 3) time value expiration

Naked = 1) Buy stock to fulfill obligation, 2) try to hedge more, or 3) short it down?

The thing is though‚Ä¶

[Only 35,000 available to short.](https://preview.redd.it/4sflis45bn671.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8dc03b811e1a07799a24efc65bbd06a69f9773a)

**How is the short shares availability only 35,000 out of 1.7 billion shares outstanding.**

If this explodes higher, the counterparty to the calls have no way to suppress price.

That is 374,100,000 shares.

Of course it is only above certain strikes but still.

So I think the recent headline risk/fire is a last ditch attempt to induce selling somehow.

>""The fire broke out at 5:20 a.m. due to a spark from a power outlet in one of the basements of the four-story, 127,178-square meter Deokpyeong Logistics Center in Icheon, about 80 kilometers south of Seoul, authorities said.""

I don‚Äôt think short interest numbers are accurate. Something about the previous drop last month seemed too extreme too fast. If there is any chance that the drop induced shorts, naked calls, or panic hedging, the V-bounce caught them off guard and they tried to suppress price -- only increasing their cost basis at a lower strike/price.

Opinions?

Disclaimer: I am long.

It could easily surpass what I think is fair value.  I tend to think it'll spike back up to $20+ on hype, and then probably sell off after earnings in August.

Good luck."
2021-06-21 21:15:38,wallstreetbets,"It's up over 60% in a month.  Clearly it was a good play a month ago.  If you're saying he's late to the game, maybe.  But with current volume and hype, short covering, bullish analyst PTs, a new partnership with Prestashop, still being down 40% from IPO and >50% from ATHs, and significant revenue growth, it's not unrealistic to think the run isn't over.

To be honest, I can't tell if the people like you bashing WISH are salty apes or hedge fund bots/employees with short interest.  Don't be mad you missed the play... The market doesn't revolve around 2 stocks and neither does WSB; there are other plays to be had."

Also, this is a trading sub... You can make money on shit companies if you can time a bounce.  And Wish has every reason to be bouncing right now.  And if you don't think you can time the market, why are you in a trading sub?  Go to an investing sub."

My story is a lot like yours.  Lived cheaply, invested heavily early, finished school late, got a high paying job, and still lived like a regular guy.

Sure, I can do fun stuff when I want and don't have to worry about the price of a lot of things, but the things I thought I'd do with $X never seem to turn out to be what I actually end up doing.  Which is usually nothing lol.  Now I just try to give to my community and set up my son and neices/nephews to be in a similar position someday.

you see, wish is a known shill stock, along with clove clne etc, i have no problem with people investing elsewhere, obviously. i wish WSB wasnt deeply imbedded with HF shills. but again (and they'll downvote me for this, as shills do) it is, and has become a tool for them to monitor our moves, as well as to advertise stocks as ""the next meme shgkskwkfksk"" in order to bring in newbies who feel as though they missed the bus, and manipulate them into going against the two tickers with biggest potential to fuck over HF's. and prolong their end.

 id be dragging my feet on the walk to the noose too. 

you think they havent bought the sub? you think they arent manipulating you right now with the PnD's? you think people posting DD's and commenting in this very thread arent shilling? arent bots?

invest in wish, go right ahead, nobody is stopping you. but if you wanna be a shill and defend shills, jesus christ, thats your legacy, i honestly dont care. i have other stocks as well besides meme stocks, i just make sure to research what im buying before i invest, to make sure im not helping those soulless cucks rob another generation of their tax dollars. 

dont say i didnt warn you if they pull the rug before you realise your profits. that would be a shame if they got away with your money too.

2021-06-22 15:17:31,wallstreetbets,"Sigh. Look. While I agree with OP's sentiment of saving, living below your means, etc, the math still doesn't add up based on his (or her) comments.

You can fuck with the assumptions as much as you want, but being fairly generous, let's assume OP was making 50% above average US wage (per OECD data) every year from the age 12 (when they claimed they started investing) onward and puts 15% of gross salary into S&P500. Total portfolio value in 2016 (when OP claims they hit $1M using this strategy) is \~$450k (using actual annual S&P500 returns).

Even at double the average wage (puts wage at 35 at $120k, not too shabby), portfolio value is $670k in 2016. And OP commented they were making close to minimum wage for a while, and I'm sure weren't earning full salary from ages 12-18...

Anyways. Point being is their sentiment and comment advice is good. But simply saying ""put 10-15% in SPY annually and in 15 years you'll have $1M"" is fucking misleading (although you should strive to save/invest 10-15% of your salary as a good thumb rule). Might be true if you make $100k+ annually from age 20 onward (which obviously some people, and perhaps many in this sub, do), but not if you earn an ""average to decent"" wage, as per their comments.

S&P500 average from '93 - '20 is 9.5%. So, sure, higher than the 6% I started with. But probably not as high as you thought. Dot com and 2008 crashes really did a number on returns."

2021-06-22 07:50:33,wallstreetbets,"The thing about everything you just said is that I know for a fact that I'm not being manipulated on WISH, because I was in it before I ever saw it posted on WSB.  I was looking for some stocks with long term potential and good charts and WISH was one I found on my own.

I also know I'm not being manipulated away from GME and AMC because I was *never* in AMC, and I was only in GME pre-squeeze, and I never had any intention of buying either one post-squeeze.  And maybe y'all GME and AMC shills are right that the squeeze isn't over, but for me it's too risky, because it's a long way down to a fair valuation from current prices.  I'm not risking everything on those crazy plays.

You should also know by now that they will do everything in their power to win that fight from here, and currently you look to be on the losing side, and that's not where I want to put my money.  Has nothing to do with what any ""shills"" have said.

And if I *were* somehow being manipulated on WISH, they managed to manipulate me into making tens of thousands of dollars, so I guess I should thank them for manipulating me.  Pretty sure no rug pull at this point could get me back to negative."

At times I did more other times less depending on the month and what I made as I worked by the hour so OT played a roll... I always took all the OT I could get also FYI.  I also if you read started at 12 years old, I mowed lawns and shoveled snow as a kid and saved almost every penny as a child.

2021-06-21 22:01:55,wallstreetbets,"Hello OP, WKHS bull here but I will agree with you on the state of the subreddit, too many conspiracy theorists and the autism spectrum is through the roof. HOWEVER, I am still bullish on the stock regardless.

Ironically, I'm the author of [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o374vm/why_wkhs_is_going_to_be_the_next_rocket_ship_to/), and have yet to do a write-up on the fundamentals.

I'm going to keep it brief here but if you want a longer read check [this comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o374vm/why_wkhs_is_going_to_be_the_next_rocket_ship_to/h2kg8g9/?context=3)! 

But tl;dr Oshkosh and the USPS board are both shady, [only 10% of their fleet will be electric](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131375_fresh-usps-mail-trucks-revealed-not-all-will-be-electric), which goes against the Biden Administration stating that all federal vehicles are to be electric. 

[Oshkosh's is currently under investigation and their contract is on halt](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/09/house-lawmakers-push-biden-administration-to-investigate-usps-contract-with-oshkosh-.html). 

WKHS will continue to build revenue regardless of the contract with [more orders coming through](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/04/workhorse-group-announces-order-for-more-electric/).

And forming a bull case for OSK does not automatically make WKHS bearish. It is against my ethics to invest into a company like OSK that shadily managed to take a deal away from an EV company with legitimate technology and products. The whole idea is to push for a greener future, and if this is also Biden's goal there's no way he would let this slide.

WKHS focus on manufacturing EV's. OSK is a fucking military company."
2021-06-21 20:16:41,wallstreetbets,OP. What possessed you to write this? Mods why was this allowed?
2021-06-22 01:42:37,wallstreetbets,Because it sucks lol
2021-06-21 22:32:30,wallstreetbets,"I'll be honest, I was really really hesitant to open up this reply because this whole day has been a tard nightmare, so it makes me so beyond happy to see somebody presenting points to create a discussion that we can hopefully both gain from. 

Yes I know that only 10% of the fleet will be electric, but I remember the electric announcement coming after to the USPS announcement. I know the push to make new postal vehicles has been going for years, so I don't know if the bill was mainly focused on then being electric or mainly focused on them being improvements of previous vehicles, but that article you have seems to believe it does so I could be wrong and will definitely do more research on that. 

The biggest issue is that the specifics of the case are currently private and therefore mostly speculative. I'm not saying that WKHS is going to fail, in fact I think it will shoot amazingly in a year or two, but I think that right now they don't have the fundamentals for me to get behind, although I'm happy you told me some of their contracts they did get.

Oshkosh announced they would be able to increase that 10% figure greatly if they just had a billion or so more in the contract, which Biden might find easier (given how much infrastructure and capability they already have) than switching the contract to WKHS and having them profit. 

It would go against my ethics to support OSK too, but I don't think Oshkosh ""took"" anything from anybody. WKHS has been losing a lot of contracts lately likely because of the fundamentals I mentioned and them getting a class action lawsuits filed against them makes me think that a lot of investors believe they were mislead as well.

Thank you for all the source, I would provide one for each paragraph but I took my insomnia medication an hour ago and I'm about to keel over and die, but I'll put sources up tomorrow if I remember or am reminded

Here's the big news: ALL SHORT SQUEEZES are essentially banned at the moment. The sub has new rules against market manipulation because it is illegal and will get the sub shut down if not enforced. What I wrote doesn't break a single rule of this sub, that's why it's allowed.

2021-06-21 20:42:55,wallstreetbets,"Well the question seemed rhetorical so I didn't think you actually wanted an answer considering that your entire answer is plainly written on the post above you. I realized that WKHS has absolutely zero chance of recovering its contract so unless you're in it for the multiple year long term then best look somewhere else, OSK took a dip that's really easy to take advantage of and I did and so should you, and the desire to see what people had to say about all of these positions, which wasn't in the post but was implicit since it was labeled discussion. Sadly I forgot just how retarded GME made this sub and so most answers have boiled down into people thinking their ""this convinced me to buy more WKHS"" joke was original, ""um have you checked this single sites estimate that says 60%"", and saying that I work for a hedge fund. Nothing has addressed WKHS's abysmal earnings, bad profit margins, bad track record, consistently losing contracts, being sued for lying to investors and nothing has addressed the opposing against Oshkosh and their amazing earnings, profitable dip, amazing fundamentals, etc. because this sub has lost all character in place of become a group of conspirators. If you watch the Ted Talk by a former cult member about how to know if you're in a cult then it's very disturbing how closely it matches this subs current states, except you don't HAVE to give up anything to be part of this cult."

2021-06-22 16:24:11,wallstreetbets,"If you are thinking it's $20 or $30 stock, then you are wrong.  WISH will reach Amazon if not beat Amazon. Holding 1450 shares on a long term. If you sell 20 or 30 you are inviting shorts to attack it again and let them win."
2021-06-22 03:44:47,wallstreetbets,Is it going to do what CLOV did?
2021-06-21 20:37:40,wallstreetbets,I already spent mine.
2021-06-22 01:55:53,wallstreetbets,Knew it.
2021-06-22 07:06:58,wallstreetbets,Probably‚Ä¶ hedge funds are trying to cash in to cover their short bets on amc and gme. Everyone going for quick gains on wish are actually slowing things down.
2021-06-22 11:43:41,wallstreetbets,I'm crying ü§£
2021-06-22 16:28:09,wallstreetbets,No one is slowing anything down this isn't a team sport. You invest to make money.
2021-06-21 21:15:56,wallstreetbets,If it does and I can afford a new tenere 700 motorcycle I'll put a wish sticker on the bad boi :D
2021-06-22 17:19:25,wallstreetbets,This is the truth.
2021-06-22 18:36:12,wallstreetbets,"Applying for mod or something?

What‚Äôs next, want to tell us to take gains at 15%?"
2021-06-21 22:18:10,wallstreetbets,but you are literally hundreds of dollars away from buying a new indian bobber?
2021-06-21 22:54:55,wallstreetbets,Ah can't go offroad and have fun with the indian bobber without it exploding

WISH $25 earlier than you expect."
2021-06-21 20:40:35,wallstreetbets,Because it has a price target above its current price is a really good reason.
2021-06-22 05:08:02,wallstreetbets,"Clov performed a sec filing, didn't see WISH doing that."
2021-06-22 14:18:51,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm stil CLOV
2021-06-21 20:43:31,wallstreetbets,Clov is currently trading over its price target while wish is trading $5 under its price target. How is clov the better bet?

2021-06-21 23:19:30,wallstreetbets,The short positions in CLOV are way higher.  Right now wish is killing it but Clov keeps getting shorter while they try to keep the options from popping. Volume has been up last couple days.
2021-06-21 23:17:06,wallstreetbets,They are being shorted big time because of the options.  They had to cover last Friday but there are a lot in the next two weeks and the actual float is about the short count. Once this really gets out there it could fly.  Clov board is showing the count short to now be 104%.  Sec.gov has a filing with notices this could be a short squeeze.  People are showing where that was filed for GME before it blew sky high.  I had to add 1000 more just to be safe. Hope that helps
2021-06-22 10:12:37,wallstreetbets,well is working out!
2021-06-22 02:21:25,wallstreetbets,Look what they did to my boy
2021-06-21 23:53:02,wallstreetbets,So different plays. Got it. May as well buy some clov if that‚Äôs how it is.  Cheap right now.
2021-06-21 22:53:03,wallstreetbets,!Remindme 6 weeks
2021-06-21 20:13:35,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs what they told me in March about AMC, the original ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù. Glad I didn‚Äôt listen."
2021-06-21 20:01:13,wallstreetbets,"I might be paranoid but I believe the two big players in this whole squeeze , naked short drama are GME and AMC. Before them you would hardly see anyone talking about a squeeze possibility. All of a sudden, now every stock, WISH, CLOV, ‚Äú might squeeze ‚Äú .

2021-06-21 22:54:40,wallstreetbets,yeah bro AMC is SuCh a DIsTraCtIon. Shit was $5. Those who bought and held with conviction made a shit load of money when it ran up to $72. That‚Äôs a 14x increase in price.
2021-06-21 22:42:02,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs fair. I bought into the fud about amc being a distraction, so I dodged amc when it was 5$ and dodged gme at 50$... eventually got into amc at a cost basis of 12.74 and still holding. I just can‚Äôt make heads or tails of 104% institutional ownership. Been thinking about buying puts on wish and clov to be honest."
2021-06-21 22:40:13,wallstreetbets,"Umm ok. But seriously, go check your trading app and look at the ownership %"
2021-06-22 01:34:28,wallstreetbets,"Short selling is one of the two probable causes of institutional ownership being listed over 100% (the other being erroneous, delayed data).

CLOV has been shorted like crazy, as pointed out."

2021-06-21 21:10:11,wallstreetbets,I was the same. I had $155 calls that were upwards of $1800 each. I got greedy and didn't exercise them.
2021-06-22 05:33:16,wallstreetbets,Sounds like greed is the problem - not CLOV
2021-06-22 14:27:26,wallstreetbets,"If by greed, you mean trying to maximize the profit of my investment in a volatile market, but ultimately resulting in an ill timed exit strategy, then yes."
2021-06-22 03:34:04,wallstreetbets,"So, how have you been doing the last couple weeks?"

2021-06-22 15:10:01,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I feel bad for everyone falling for these $WISH and $CLOV short squeeze lies. If your doing a little day trade riding it up to make some money that's great, I do too but in no way is this a long term or short squeeze play. The only safest YOLO play for a short squeeze is $AMC. It's the only unique stock where retail owns the float with tons of facts on why this will happen. Short squeezes are hard to come by but $AMC had is the only real potential for one"
2021-06-21 21:55:12,wallstreetbets,This is the largest shill campaign I‚Äôve witnessed YTD well done üëç
2021-06-21 20:56:38,wallstreetbets,How do you type with such big balls in the way. Holy shit.
2021-06-21 20:55:44,wallstreetbets,They have also been investing in logistics to make those deliveries a lot shorter. Also starting to work with local brick and mortar for pickup points and supply.
2021-06-22 06:01:54,wallstreetbets,Same thoughts. I mean AMC GME NOK BB. I can trust my money with. But WISH sounds Fishy.
2021-06-21 21:04:54,wallstreetbets,Its insanely cheap.  Half the people I know actively buy from wish.
2021-06-21 21:01:53,wallstreetbets,This... Plus it's a pretty huge online retailer at a smoking cheap price. Good chance for an early buy. Already said to have rejected a 10bil buyout from Amazon. Things will change and evolve. They have a great starting point. I think it's still very undervalued. I've been looking for a stock to get into like this for a while. 15k shares at 12.32.
2021-06-22 10:56:30,wallstreetbets,Fun-dee-mentalz n shit
2021-06-22 08:25:43,wallstreetbets,"People buy stocks early, then use bot accounts and ""apes"" to mass pump the stock. If you notice the gains on many people posting these stocks, their initial investments were at $8 to $9 dollars per share.  This sub has been brigaded by pump-and-dump pros who downvote the bagholders when the fun is done, so noone sees the failure and everyone jumps on the next pump. 

Wish.com is, and always will be a joke (as literally everyone knows), but yet here we are.

The strategy works, just don't get greedy and be caught holding the bag when all these ""DIAMOND HAND"" folks secretly sell, but convince you they didn't."
2021-06-21 20:38:58,wallstreetbets,They took more overdraft fees than any other bank during the pandemic. Bad bank gang
2021-06-21 21:10:30,wallstreetbets,"Not since he purchased it, just for the day. You click on position details if you want all of your tax lot information."
2021-06-21 21:05:15,wallstreetbets,"That's cool, but it doesn't change the fact that alot of the shit they sell is just that; shit. So maybe in the future you'll be able to get your garbage delivered faster. There are entire youtube channels dedicated to buying suspiciously cheap electronics from Wish just to reveal that they are, in fact, fake ass junk. Pretty entertaining. The best so far was the cheap SSD that turned out to be a bunch of daisy chained flash drives inside of a cheap plastic case."
2021-06-21 21:29:38,wallstreetbets,This type of stuff is obviously something they need to work on. They will evolve. They get lots of traffic and buyers. I think they are a work in progress. Just the beginning. That's why it's 12-13 bucks and not 1500 bucks. Yet.
2021-06-21 20:02:31,wallstreetbets,You realize I‚Äôm going to use apes for everything now right? Thank you for the term

2021-06-21 22:11:15,wallstreetbets,One day RKT is going to be a $100 stock. This company literally prints money and is gobbling up market share in multiple sectors.
2021-06-21 23:59:53,wallstreetbets,"The main FUD I absolutely dont get. ""RKT IS CYCLICAL."" They only talk about the negatives of the MORTGAGE company, and refuse to utter the words Fintech. RKTs building a MegaDome of finacial tools, programs, and companies, while sitting on a shit pot of money for acquisitions. Hell they structured the share class specifically for acquisitions. Let's see, we have the number one mortgage company in the us, that also is becoming a direct competitor to Zillow with RocketHome. Then we have RKT auto because they said shit what else....CAR SALES! Let's do that, oh its ALREADY HIGHLY PROFITABLE in the pre full release phase?  The most dangerous weapon a powerhouse company like this has is the cash on hand to become WHATEVER they want to be next. 

Nope, SELL, High Sell Rating.

2021-06-21 22:37:25,wallstreetbets,Aphria holder too.  If it wasn‚Äôt for Simon I‚Äôd have sold.  Let‚Äôs be real‚Ä¶.this stock is WAY undervalued
2021-06-22 08:56:45,wallstreetbets,TLRY is the future of the Cannabis market! This is definitely not a Meme stock.
2021-06-22 08:03:45,wallstreetbets,"Purchased 20,000 shares of TLRY. I am long"
2021-06-22 19:17:30,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not long because with this word of long, short sellers use to take profit every day with their shorts. over $30 is the base price for me."

2021-06-21 20:15:47,wallstreetbets,At least 30 is fair.
2021-06-22 05:01:14,wallstreetbets,"In the US, the feds get more tax revenue keeping it illegal if states make it legal. This forces companies to report and file taxes. With it being illegal federally, it limits the deductions they‚Äôre allowed to deduct (for THC). This doesn‚Äôt apply to the public companies as OP mentioned, but for all the private cannabis companies. I think that‚Äôs also a big factor in while it has been so hard to make it legal at the federal level while more and more states legalize it. It‚Äôs the best setup for the governments to collect taxes revenue."
2021-06-21 20:15:55,wallstreetbets,Me as well
2021-06-21 20:16:30,wallstreetbets,This is such a no brainer. 10x potential in 5 years.

2021-06-21 20:14:22,wallstreetbets,Yes I was an Aphria holder as well.
2021-06-21 21:28:21,wallstreetbets,"Yes! Considering all its aspects, $tlry should be above $30. It‚Äôs fair!"

2021-06-21 21:00:45,wallstreetbets,"Probably because BB is trash.

Go back in time to 2015ish.  They just utterly shit the smart phone market. Remember their app marketplace?  Neither does anyone else.

Their best product right now is some security software that is competing against MSFT.  And it is doing a really bad job of it. 

Sweet, sweet PUT options."

Those changed my life. The subsequent ones at higher strikes after the 150 climb also made tons. 


It was super risky though. I think the subsequent ones were $20 each ($2k)."

There were confessions of a MM floating around describing how they manipulate the market. I was lucky enough to get out of a stock before it got shut down and rode it from .15 to $26 a share. 

I was a more well known poster on a board and remember getting messages after the stock got shut down, ‚ÄúI lost my kids college fund‚Äù ‚ÄúI lost my mortgage payment‚Äù what do it do? It wasn‚Äôt fun. 

Manipulation is real. When I read these threads and see ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù or ‚Äúonly buy, no sell‚Äù I feel bad for them as they will eventually watch their stock go to zero and wonder how many of those post are from people with ulterior motives. It‚Äôs not a profit till you sell."

- He said retail would cause volatility in the market and

2021-06-21 20:40:56,wallstreetbets,Do not think this includes AMC or GME. The DD is done and is solid on those.

2021-06-22 00:15:06,wallstreetbets,"There's this local financial advisor who claims to be an expert saying that Gamestop (GME) is going to be the next big thing in terms of stocks. Putting memes aside, not only is the company overvalued, but there's really nothing set in store for the future (IMO). Many traders took his advice and bought it shortly before their recent earnings report.  I'm sad to report they took the bait and lost over 30% of their investment. If I had to take a guess, those invested in GME probably lost over $100K. What also grinds my gears is that he keeps saying there's going to be a rebound very soon as they hope for the best. At one point, I asked him how much did he invest in GME. He told me to GTFO threatened to call the police if I didn't leave. Makes me wonder if he's intentionally giving false advise to ruin others' financial lives.

On another sidenote, IMO, I believe that GME was also the mastermind in the rise of meme stocks. Please note that I don't have any evidence supporting my claim and is clearly speculation. I ask myself, why was it GME that was shorted and not some other company with similar financial settings? Short squeezing is nothing new to the markets. My belief is that GME intentionally inflated the markets so that they can sell their own stock at those inflated prices. Granted, it appears they haven't sold any yet based from SEC guidelines, but it may be their ultimate goal in the longer run. GME is a morally bankrupt company when it comes to ethics, and this wouldn't surprise me based on their controversies from the past. I believe they're doing whatever it takes to take another quick buck to keep the business alive, even at the expense of their employees and customers.

tldr; Don't let your feelings get the best of you in the markets. The stock market doesn't care about your feelings. Research, learn from your mistakes, and write personal notes for future reference."

2021-06-21 20:22:46,wallstreetbets,CLNE is still awaiting its run
2021-06-21 21:06:06,wallstreetbets,"Dark Pool data for BB (6/18): $-2,349,440,000 
Dark Pool data for BB (6/21): $-2,378,070,000

Net change was: ~$-29,000,000

The interpretation of this data is that shares are being bought in the dark pools and being sold out into the open market. Obviously, this scenario is not unique to BB. It‚Äôs happening to AMC too to a greater extent. 

Just food for thought. Not saying price will go up or down or sideways in the near future, just that entities operating in the dark pools have an overall net negative position. To my understanding, the data encompasses the last 20 trading days."

However, I did end up losing a lot on it when the VIX went from 25-30 territory to 15-20 where it's at now during the bull run at the beginning of the year.

2021-06-22 01:33:17,wallstreetbets,"Lol I love that narrative that just because well they had a pandemic in 1918 and look at how well the economy was after the fact.  This ignores one huge event that you know happened for the 4 years prior.  A war where countries like Great Britain, France and Germany lost anywhere from 5-10% of their male populations.  That doesn't even factor in the effects of the Spanish flu.  So yeah typically if you survive what was at the time the bloodiest conflict in human history and then a pandemic after the fact that sure you will be coming into a labor market that is far better for the worker than normally would be and that would lead to an era of prosperity.  

COVID doesn't even kill 1% of the people who have it.  There arent any parallels you can draw to imagine what the world will look like by comparing the roaring 20s to the 2020s by viewing it from the perspective of pandemic equals prosperity.  Here's how I think this plays out.  Its smooth sailing until we hit one bad GDP report.  Then theres a correction which leads to a recession.  We don't know what the true cost of shutting down the entire world for months basically.  I drive down the main street of my podunk little town and I can see a dozen businesses that were there prior to covid not coming back.  Once all these unemployment plus benefits run out we are going to see a glut of labor on the market and not the jobs to fill it which will lead to a more competitive labor market and all those supposed gains that are around now will be given back 2 fold.

My bet the shock comes q1 or q2 2022 GDP report.  Then a recession leading into 2023"

Further, I shit on the apes because they're pathologically incapable of making a good decision, even if you lead them right to it and put it in their face.  Look at every stock they rally behind - they literally find the absolute worst company they can locate in a sector and pile into that.  But every time they do, they create a bunch of bagholders who then spend months trying to convince everybody to take their bags, which results in weakened splintered spend.

OH, you want to invest in entertainment?  Lots of options there.  $DIS, $FUN, $SIX...technically even $FUBO falls into this.  But that's for suckers and chumps, let's throw all our money in a failing movie theatre chain that openly uses you as an ATM.

&#x200B;

Renewable energy, that's the future!  Are they in $BE or $CLNE or even $BLDP?  Fuuuuck no, they're buying $NKLA, $RIDE and $QS.

&#x200B;

Biotech?  Huge volatility, this should be fun.  But why do $NVTA or the like when you can pile into clinical stage testing plays like OCGN or a 1-product company that makes glucose monitors or...what was that company that makes it faster to do blood tests on dogs?  Whatever that one was.

&#x200B;

Re-opening and rental cars?  Sure $CAR is posiitioned to thrive and emerge stronger than before, but there's this other company going through bankruptcy.  Let's do that.

&#x200B;

Every fucking stock they pile into, almost without exception ($BB, $WEN) is literally the absolute worst company in the sector they could buy into.  And on those rare occasions they do accidentally stumble into something worthwhile, they're out of it in 1-3 days with no conviction like they're allergic to good decisions.  The entire concept of ""let's attack the shorts"" only works if it turns out the shorts are A) overleveraged and B) the underlying company doesn't deserve what's happening to it.  These companies?  Deserve every put placed against them."
2021-06-21 22:23:14,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt believe you left out MVIS (haha ah today).
2021-06-21 23:31:19,wallstreetbets,Are you actively shorting any of the tickers they prop up? Thinking of buying some puts on $WISH when this inevitably blows over.
2021-06-22 18:26:50,wallstreetbets,What's your long-term price target for CLNE?
2021-06-21 23:39:25,wallstreetbets,Not sure BB deserves to be on that list. That one is actually a good play.
2021-06-22 03:07:29,wallstreetbets,"I'll scalp a lot of them (especially Clover and MVIS) if I'm at my main base of operations and have access to my macros and all the screens, etc.  Not presently, as we're all basically living out of suitcases traveling.  Typically won't hold them because one bad day of retard strength can wipe out weeks of gains in shorting them.  The only way to effectively trade them is to adopt a Warrior Trading mentality towards them.

&#x200B;

Raisinets I don't usually touch, but I made an exception last Friday when I took a  bunch of shares and set up a sell wall at 59.98 so that they couldn't get to $60 by expiry as sort of a ""fuck you"" to all the b ullshit they had been pulling all day trying to tear down other equities to promote their own.  Video games I have a pile of active shorts sitting comfortably at 408.  Not so much because I'm trying to profit off of them (I took most of my profits when it fell to 50), but rather because it amuses me to have them look at the SI and think they've got some HF on the ropes (as I would imagine most of the other people with shorts are up in that 400 area, as well) and I like to imagine them flinging shit over it."
2021-06-22 00:34:51,wallstreetbets,Bb is 'without exception' and bracketed.. as in its an exception

2021-06-22 16:26:38,wallstreetbets,"Amazing DD! I see that there are many catalysts between now and September, but would you recommend going further out with the strikes, say Oct or Dec. The spreads are super wide on most of the calls though."
2021-06-22 17:03:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, in regards to the spreads that's why I gave a warning. But to answer your strike date, Q3 is reported in November, so you're going to have to pay extra premium for the DEC strike.

I found that the stock was way oversold, even relative to the other homebuilder stocks, so I was reasonably comfortable with the September Strikes because IV was low, and the stock should easily get past 72.66 by then which is my break even (especially with all the earnings in July + economic forecast data and decreasing commodity pricing). 

The stock went down all the way to 60.47 but rebounded Monday and Today sharply to 66.81. As it stands I'm roughly break even, premium wise and i still have months to go. 

Ultimately, it's your decision man. I think September or December calls are fine."
2021-06-21 21:08:52,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs your strike on the RKT august calls

2021-06-21 20:08:38,wallstreetbets,"I'm talking about someone executing an option ATM or slightly OTM lol. Even slightly ITM can be money losers. The morons even buying 145c on AMC... just wow.

I think AMC is retarded but I may pick up 300 shares just to write calls against. If it keeps going I should break even and eventually sell when the shit crashes like it will"
2021-06-21 20:38:52,wallstreetbets,"Exactly 
I WISH they would assign my shares at 145 strike price when AMC is trading at 60-70 dollars lol. I might even go down to 100."
2021-06-21 23:29:59,wallstreetbets,Just because it can be done doesn't mean it will be. You're likelihood is unlikely. But 100 strike should mean more premium. I don't foresee amc breaking 70 but that's up to you.
2021-06-21 20:02:02,wallstreetbets,Not passive if you buy them in Texas before it becomes the new California and short lease tf out of them via air bnb. That money is like option trading with no risk
