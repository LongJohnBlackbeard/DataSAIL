2021-06-18 19:55:38,stocks,"My calculations are basically as long as Wti oil stays above $62.50 a barrel for a year they should be able to have that resolved though. Or at least get out of what the ratings company consider over leveraged territory. 

On the high side, if oil averages up to $100, which some are predicting but I'm skeptical of, OXY could potentially get that resolved in 6 months."
2021-06-18 19:40:37,stocks,Why wouldn’t they have to? If you look into their 10k they also include financial info from 2 years prior to their IPO as well.
2021-06-18 19:28:49,stocks,"Only a crystal ball knows for sure but I’d focus on both growth and value. Some are saying that things are going to rotate back toward growth in the second half of the year. Others say not. Nobody really knows for sure.

The bigger banks in particular stand to have a pop after the dividend/buyback prohibitions end of 6/30 and we find out whether they will raise dividends and by how much. Or they could decline. Who knows?

I’ve got BAC I bought last year and I’ve added some C and WFC over the last week or so (for multiple reasons, not just the 6/30 thing).

XLF definitely gives you diverse exposure and is probably a good way to “bet” on banks if you don’t care to pick individual stocks."

2021-06-18 19:11:27,stocks,"What platform are you trading on?

To answer your question, yes I have seen this before, and also on GME.

I experienced this on RH during the first squeeze when they halted trading and off and on for about a week afterwards.  But when it happened to me it wasn't just one strike price, it was multiples missing across all dates.

My theory was that they removed options from the chain to prevent purchases."
2021-06-18 19:17:45,stocks,"Interesting, thanks for sharing that you’ve seen strikes removed before - I don’t know if 215 was removed or just never sold, but I guess the former is more likely the case. Hopefully we will find and get confirmation from someone in the know that it’s an extremely unusual occurrence (or even a prohibited one). 

I verified the 6/18 215s weren’t available across Fidelity, Schwab, and TDA. Also, you can see it’s missing from the chain at maximum-pain.com as well (not sure where they source their data."
2021-06-18 19:47:55,stocks,This guy is straight up lying. No one removed any existing strikes from the chain to prevent purchases. Grab your tinfoil hat and fuck right off to where you came from.

2021-06-18 18:00:34,stocks,"Imagine copy-pasting the pipeline of any random biotech company and talking about the high short float as if that’s a positive. 

This company makes no money and hasn’t in its entire existence. It doesn’t mean it can’t or won’t in the future, but there’s too much speculation to even throw a price tag on it.

Not to mention of course the whole chance of a smaller company with a advanced niche treatment potentially being bought out but you know, what do I know.

2021-06-18 18:39:46,stocks,"I don’t even have a negative opinion of the company per se. I couldn’t tell you one way or another whether or not their pipeline pans out. However, neither can you. It’s discouraging that they haven’t had a strong record of drugs moving past stage 3 and FDA approval to begin with, but who knows. The past does not necessarily dictate the future. 

A pump is a pump though. This isn’t serious DD as there was no attempt to identify potential risks investing in the stock (of which there are PLENTY). Furthermore, the wsb pump theme going on by identifying a high short float is not a good reason to invest. Maybe trading for fun, but it has no basis for the stock’s inherent value. 

Whether or not you are “right” with this stock is irrelevant to me. The current methodology you’re implementing for this investment is not a strong long-term strategy and it’ll be hard to replicate with success."
2021-06-18 18:43:23,stocks,"I wasn't aware that I had to do everyone's research for them? I mentioned some of the potential upsides which if I'm not mistaken for anyone who's at any experience investing in pharmaceuticals, especially those that are reliant on results of late-stage clinical trials, would know that the downside very much so exists if those trials are unsuccessful. Thus far these trials have had very good results. They did have another drug which I didn't mention because it wasn't having stellar results but it's also not one of their lead products which the two I mentioned are.

And you're right, this isn't a long-term play. This is a swing play for a couple of weeks or maybe months. Depending on how things play out am I end up buying some shares to hold for a year or two and then reassess my position from there."

2021-06-18 19:43:36,stocks,Tech is definitely touching highs again.  Wonder if we'll see a breakout next week possibly?  Only headlines I've been seeing are inflation worries and possibly interest rate hike in 2023.  Meh.  Although nonsense is happening with Israel/Hamas again.  Still seems like tech revenue keeps rising so maybe we'll break out next week.  Hard to say.

2021-06-18 17:16:33,stocks,"I have money set aside to buy, which makes no sense why this popped. Growth took a hit today, but this and a handful of other growth just surged. Sounds like a PND to me. Hedge funds manipulating to create fomo to sell against retail."
2021-06-18 19:48:04,stocks,"That doesn't make sense to me. Growth techs should be heavily affected by the news, but it seems like valuations are getting worse and worse. This is almost at 80 RSI. If you're a technical person, this is overbought. If you're a non technical person, this is valued way too high. I'm thinking next week is bad for everyone, probably 3% down min for all sectors."
2021-06-18 15:48:10,stocks,"1. What is the product/what are the products. Is there projected room for growth? Who are the competitors? What does the next 5 years look like for the sector?

3. positive EBITDA preferred.
4. If pre-revenue or early revenue, point 1 needs to be absolutely stellar. Which it can be.
5. Catalysts
6. Bear case: Worst case scenarios. What happens if the interest rate rises and PEs return to historic norms? When? What is the competition doing, do their pipelines hint at anything?
7. general rule of thumb: if YOY Growth % is lower than the current PE (say, 50% growth expected PE at 80), I am going to look for other things.

Looking at the balance sheet is a necessity, but it isnt enough by itself. Intel has a gorgeous balance sheet, a beautiful PE. If going by the book, the present moment, you would go to intel. But you then look at the products, there is a serious problem, and its hard to imagine that it would not lose market share, and probably revenue as well.

And finally when choosing an entry point this is the hard point. If the stock has recently spiked it probably needs to cool off for a bit before I enter. ""A bit"" is highly subjective. Depends on catalysts and market. Honestly half the time I buy a stock it goes down for a week, half the time up. Sometimes it loses 20%, sometimes it goes up 20%."

2021-06-18 15:38:07,stocks,"price to earnings ratio, PEG, price to sales, price to book are all measures of value. always read the annual and quarterly reports and get a sense of what the company is doing. compare the ratios to the peers or sector performance. Try and make your own calculations based on the company filing, rather than sites like CNBC, yahoo etc. There can be errors. Do your own math and see if it matches up with whats published and if there is a discrepancy follow your method.  I like this W.  Buffett saying: ""One thing that could help would be to write down the reason you are buying a stock before your purchase. Write down ""I am buying Microsoft at $300 billion because..."" Force yourself to write this down. It clarifies your mind and discipline."""

2021-06-18 16:00:34,stocks,That is a glorious write up. Thanks for your effort with it.
2021-06-18 14:09:35,stocks,That is correct. Another scenario is the stock crashes to $5 overnight and you won’t be able to sell because your shares are locked up unless you close out the option
2021-06-18 14:28:23,stocks,"You still lose money if the stock drops obviously, caps the upside, reduces risk, increases brokerage fees"
2021-06-18 17:04:02,stocks,"This is incorrect. Your worst case scenario is if the stock goes to zero. In that case you incur a 900 dollar loss on your overall position. Your ""worst case scenario"" is actually the best case scenario if you are considering your overall position and not just the covered call as a standalone security."
2021-06-18 14:06:05,stocks,Correct
2021-06-18 16:53:36,stocks,"My question is, who then decides the premium? I do since I own the contract?"
2021-06-18 17:54:45,stocks,i'm a little confused as well; what is the downside to this? is there a reason to not sell covered calls if it's a business yoy trust?
2021-06-18 15:40:25,stocks,"The worst case scenario is the underlying value drop a certain percentage, you will lose a good chunk of money. Especially with low volatility you will be getting only a fraction of the premium paid even if you try to shake off the covered call.

In your example you may be able to buy back in around $60 for a instant $40 profit on the premium but your stocks are worth much less. If it keeps trending downward, your covered call wont be able to cover the loss. The risk here is that it massively slow down any exits you want to make. This is incredibly important to know.

Then again you shouldnt sell covered calls on stocks you are very bearish on or have no intention of holding for a long time."
2021-06-18 17:27:43,stocks,"Best case scenario: Stock doesn't hit $15, and you keep all the premium and and the shares, and can repeat selling covered calls in subsequent weeks and months.

Good case scenario: Stock passes $15, you keep premium and $500 extra

Worst case scenario: XYZ goes to zero, and while you keep premium, you lose $1000 on the underlying."
2021-06-18 17:30:09,stocks,I do this but only for stocks I'm comfortable holding if there was a downturn
2021-06-18 18:17:14,stocks,Just wanted to point out you're buying 100 shares of stock xyz and not 100 stocks of stock xyz.  Your understanding is correct.
2021-06-18 19:08:22,stocks,Your losses are limited to the opportunity costs you would incur if the stock goes a lot higher than your strike price.
2021-06-18 19:28:34,stocks,"that is correct, usually though you arent getting that kind of premium on a call 50% higher than the current price lol.

the only ""loss"" you would take is if the stock skyrockets and you lose that profit that exceeds your strike price. thought you do lock up those shares until expiration so you cant sell them in an event the stock starts to tank, you would have to just buy back your call."
2021-06-18 19:44:52,stocks,">there is no way I can actually lose money doing this right?

Lose money compared to what? Compared to cash? Absolutely. The stock could fall and you'd have lost money. Compared to buying the stock and not selling the call? Absolutely. The stock could rocket and the call could expire for more money than you collected. You'd lose the difference, paid in your choice of cash or shares. 

There's most certainly the risk of loss."
2021-06-18 14:31:31,stocks,"i mean in that scenario, that call would be worthless so not really an issue to buy it back at a 99% profit. the underlying dropping 50% is a much bigger problem"
2021-06-18 14:20:26,stocks,"Yeah that's a good point as well.  So unless it's a reliable company, probably not a good idea to sell options with expiration dates too far out so you can retain some flexibility on downward trends."
2021-06-18 17:54:27,stocks,"Yea that make sense, never thought about it from that perspective.  thanks."
2021-06-18 17:07:05,stocks,"Don't think of ""premium"" as you would with insurance where the buyer has to make consecutive monthly payments. It's a one time up front payment, and just like with stocks there is a bid/ask spread to determine how much the option is worth."
2021-06-18 16:59:05,stocks,The buyer and seller have to agree on a premium. That becomes the trade price.
2021-06-18 18:46:54,stocks,the bid ask spread determines the premium. market makers basically determine the price
2021-06-18 18:12:47,stocks,The downside is you could potentially lose out on additional profits if the stock price continues to go up past the strike price.
2021-06-18 18:56:17,stocks,"The downside is the same risk you take when you own a stock.  All you are doing with a covered call is reducing your entry point by the premium received.  and capping the potential gain the stock may have. 

If you bought 100 shares and $10 and sold a call for $1, you basically paid $9 per share for the stock.  If that stock goes to $0 then your loss is $900.  You already didn’t lose $1000"
2021-06-18 18:20:32,stocks,"If you're bullish longterm, a sudden price spike might force you out of your position. You'd lose potential gains, and have to pay capital gains tax if you held the shares for under a year. And if you want to pick-up another 100 shares, you'd be potentially buying back in at a higher price.

Basically you're being paid a premium, but the drawback is it limits your upside potential."
2021-06-18 19:18:09,stocks,Of course at this point you should probably ask yourself why you’re long so many stocks that are on the brink of bankruptcy.
2021-06-18 15:04:30,stocks,can you please explain what you mean about the underlying dropping being a bigger problem?
2021-06-18 18:35:00,stocks,"Not strictly true: the value of the call might stay high if the crash in the stock led to a spike in implied volatility. It's very unlikely you're buying back your call at low cost, if the goal is to get out of the losing equity position quickly."
2021-06-18 15:28:40,stocks,I personally don’t sell anything longer than a month and I consider that long. I try to stick with weeklies so that I keep getting premiums but I’m also able to adjust my position as the stock price moves.
2021-06-18 15:45:09,stocks,"If it's a reliable company then your premium is lower.

The price of the contract is mostly dependent on volatility.

This is why AMC and GME option cost so much.

You can get stuck holding the bag for AMC at $5 and lie to yourself that you're a long term investor to sleep better at night. This is from experience with rkt T_______T

edit:

I sold weeklies for ADM at $21.

Where as rkt CC I sold at a bit higher because how volatile it is.

The price of option command is mathematically determine and the broker will give you several option prices and you can either choose those or at limit order within those range.

You should look into the wheel strategy. It uses CC and CSP and just thetagang it."
2021-06-18 18:41:24,stocks,"Yes. Just to add a little more color to your answer: I own stock because I think it's going up. Selling CC gives away the upside of unlimited potential gains in return for relatively small premium. Meanwhile I'm left with nearly all the downside of the equity position because the premium collected is a trivial compensation if the stock really tanks.

I was selling CC the first quarter of this year, and it was going fine until eventually I got assigned. The lost profits on being assigned that one time eclipsed the profit of 10+ other successful CC transactions. 

Covered calls superficially look like free money, but I don't think the risk/reward calculus is really a good one..."
2021-06-18 15:16:05,stocks,"let's use your scenario: you sell a 15C for 1 dollar. The next day, the stock drops to 5. That 15C is going to be worth 1 cent so you can close it for a 99% gain instantly. However, your initial purchase is down 50% (if you bought at 10 dollars) so you're down 400 bucks (-500 + 100 premium). Therefore, the covered call is not an issue, the underlying dropping is a bigger deal."
2021-06-18 15:47:58,stocks,I love weeklies. We should create a gang like thetagang or something.
2021-06-18 15:46:12,stocks,Makes sense thanks
2021-06-18 19:14:25,stocks,What do you mean you can just close it? Haven’t you got to wait till expiration before you do anything?
2021-06-18 19:33:15,stocks,"Nope. Someone buying a call or put can exercise it any time they want to assign it to the seller. 

In this case, if you ""open"" a contract by selling a call or a put, you're basically beholden to whoever buys it. They can exercise that contract at any time, or not at all, which can put you in an unfavorable position. 

Say it rockets to $20. The call is not exercised, and is instead sold around the market due to the markup. You can't sell your shares at the moment because you could be assigned at any time until expiration, you don't want to end up naked. Suddenly, the stock plummets to $5. You still can't sell your shares (again, theres still the potential that the call can be assigned before expiration). Call expires worthless, you're stuck with the premium but half your initial investment value.

If you knew it was gonna rocket to $20 because something changed after you sold a call, you can buy back the same call at its current price to ""close"" it. You now have no obligation to keep your shares on hand, because you bought the same option you sold and have a net zero position contact wise."

2021-06-18 14:28:17,stocks,These giant banks are absolute cash cows and literally print money for a living. To think that they cannot compete with newly formed fintech is dumb.

2021-06-18 19:09:45,stocks,Most of the “fintech innovators” aren’t banks and have to partner with banks to get anything done.

2021-06-18 14:35:05,stocks,"The Fed prints the money; not the banks. I am not trying to crack the armor of those that own JPM, it is just common knowledge that the relevance of banks is waning and many are ill-equipped to change at the same pace as the emerging innovators.

Berkshire Hathaway is classified as a financial, presumably from all the insurance companies. but they also have foods (Dairy Queen, Sees Candy), Clothing (Fruit of the Loom), etc. 

so McDonalds is probably similar. lots of businesses have multiple sources of revenue, several products or services."
2021-06-18 14:25:18,stocks,Another interesting piece of info: McDonald's and Disney and Coke have a 3 way partnership that stretches back decades. Ever wonder how McDonald's can sell coke for a dollar and be profitable?

2021-06-18 14:37:32,stocks,Cause Coke syrup probably cost like 1 cent for 1 drink.
2021-06-18 15:35:28,stocks,"Ever wonder how they can sell coke for a dollar and be profitable? that's where most of their profit comes from! What is it, 99% margins on coke?"
2021-06-18 19:54:43,stocks,"What I think you fail to see is the value that their partners with coke and Disney is really about promotion. For every Disney movie that comes out there is exclusive promotions between all three of these companies ( MCDONALDs / Disney / coke ) it stretches their ad budget. 

Come get the new Disney toy from our happy meals and don’t forget the coke. Even if food sales falls off they can always count on Jr bugging mom to swing thru the drive thru to get them that happy meal. This angle is pure gold for MCD"
2021-06-18 16:50:44,stocks,"Lol, yeah, does OP think they're buying cans and pouring them into paper cups?The syrup and carbonated water cost almost nothing.  I'm not sure the cost of the equipment but that would be factored in to margin or CAPEX with ROI.  It has nothing to do with their partnership that their soda is the most profitable item, more to do with the COGS and margin."
2021-06-18 16:58:18,stocks,"Exactly.

The point being that McDonald's gets such a huge price discount on Coke products that they can afford to undercut their competitors day after day and still rake in the bucks."
2021-06-18 19:38:02,stocks,Fountain drinks are near 100 percent profit margin literally everywhere. Even mom and pop convenient stores. Source. Parents had one bad in the day. The syrup is ridiculously cheap.

2021-06-18 12:34:13,stocks,I didn’t know gains were possible with ACB
2021-06-18 12:35:55,stocks,"Copied from Google search:

The split for ACB took place on May 11, 2020. This was a 1 for 12 reverse split, meaning for each 12 shares of ACB owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 1 share. For example, a 1000 share position pre-split, became a 83.3333333333333 share position following the split.

So your 110 shares turned into 9 shares. You bought 11 more so you now own 20 shares at current price.

Today was spy ex-dividends so they get speculatively priced out of stocks that pay them (since the payments can't be known until the boards approve them).

2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,"How to short US stocks (MSTR) from Europe Hi, I'm a trader from Europe and I'm trying to find a platform that would allow me to short US stocks such as MSTR. I tried signing up on Interactive Brokers but they won't let me trade US stocks due to my low income (I'm in my early twenties); Degiro still has to approve my registration but as far as I understand they don't allow shorting on US stocks. Etoro doesn't allow shorting for this stock either. 

Are there any brokers at all that would allow me to perform such a trade here in Europe?"
2021-06-18 14:34:49,stocks,"It will depend slightly on what country you're in and your broker but there are a few ways.

The 1st is buying puts, however the options market isn't very liquid across Europe and some countries have different regulations regarding when they can be sold, so there's a good chance these are a bad idea.

The 2nd is through the use of leveraged ETPs, these are trading like stocks but instead of owning the actual stock you own the ETP which tracks a specific stock, or group of stocks and the price tracks the stock\*the leverage factor. The -1 leverage means for every 1% drop in the underlying stock the ETP gains 1%. These are available with -1x, -2x, and -3x leverage (also available for long positions with the same leverage). The downside to these is they track the daily changes so you could lose a lot of cash if the stock goes up in the short-term before dropping (they're specifically made for day trading). Also, they aren't very liquid.

The 3rd is with a CFD account, where you trade using derrivatives, essentially betting whether a stock will go up or down. However these are very high risk and I wouldn't reccomend using them unless you're an expert/very successful trader. 75-80% of people using CFD's lose money."

The 30y indicates how much opportunity is out there for banks to earn risk adjusted returns. With the inflation talks cooling down, institutions who were afraid of rising rates now feel more confident to chase 2% returns. There is nowhere else to invest for banks.

> why would investors be locking in a lower rate now than they could expect to get in a couple years or more?

The reason why the yield curve is flattening is because the Fed is signaling it won't let inflation get out of control, meaning it'll hike rates sooner but more gently to cool the economy down rather than let inflation, which tends to be sticky, run hot for a few years and hike rates very aggressively to combat it."

2021-06-18 09:49:29,stocks,"People think this actually means inflation is going to get out of control. This is the opposite.

It means rates could go negative if this keeps growing.

The banks aren't lending, therefore, aren't earning returns on their cash. They don't want to put that cash in other risky assets so they give it to the Fed who pays them a very tiny interest rate to offset the cost of interest they have to pay to their depositors.

The Fed actually slightly increased this rate at the last meeting.

Banks don't want/need more cash so they could start charging people to hold it, essentially making rates go negative. You'd think this would make inflation grow since money is so cheap (they actually pay you to take it). However, the economy is consumer driven and even if banks don't want cash, consumers never have enough of it. Therefore there's a massive supply/demand imbalance.

People want it, banks don't want to lend it. At the same time, banks still want to earn easy risk free returns on it while believing investing it in other areas is too risky.  The banks are swimming in excess cash reserves and hoarding it like Scrooge McDuck. Consumers get squeezed and still don't have enough cash to keep inflation rising."

2021-06-18 13:05:22,stocks,The problem with your bullish case is that markets are at an ATH and that's probably due to big money being already invested massively.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Futures Drop as Reflation Trade Continues Unwind: Markets Wrap U.S. equity futures fell, extending a bout of volatility ignited by surprise hawkishness at the Federal Reserve that may be exacerbated Friday by the mass expiration of stock options. Commodities slumped and the dollar touched a two-month high.

Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid about 0.7% as investors stepped back from trades tied to expectations for hot economic growth and inflation. The S&P 500 was poised to drop for a fourth day. Treasuries erased earlier gains after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on CNBC that the central bank has started discussing scaling back the pace of pandemic bond-buying.

“Investors believe the Fed will keep inflation in check, while U.S. activity is peaking,” Barclays Plc strategists led by Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note to clients. “This is driving rotation away from reflation plays and back to growth stocks.”

No.  Investors have realized the inflation trade got way ahead of the facts on the ground.  The financial news media made it about the Fed, because they always try to make it about the Fed.  Because fed stories drive clicks more than…”yeah the stock market went up today but we don’t really know why”

I doubt I could find a trader who said “yeah I am buying shares because I believe the Fed will keep inflation in check!”"

But after the media hyped inflation and commodities for the past few months, all of a sudden people aren't concerned at all. Tech is safe again, pile in. Fed promised they wouldn't raise rates until 2024, and people acted like it was set in stone. Now its 2023, and people still act like its set in stone. The reality is the fed could raise rates next month of they wanted to, or in 6 months, eventually they will have to and you'll see a reaction like 2018. Its so obvious but people will be blindsided."

When they are growing at 30-40% y/y and will be growing at this rates the next 3 years at least. So there is not interest you could raise to compete with growth stock. Any cost of capital you want to use to discount cash flows using a higher rate, is peanuts against a 30% y/y growth stock. It always a better investment, think FB, Google, Amazon, and so many others. Great opportunity to buy more of them if Mr Market gets crazy because of higher interest rates."

2021-06-18 09:22:38,stocks,"Capital depreciation.

Because they cap the upside and do not limit the downside the QYLD will tend to be exposed to more downwards pressure over time, will take longer to recover from drawdowns, and only does better than the nasdaq 100 in down or flat markets (in flat it may not even be much better due to low premiums and higher fees).

Sure it pays out a super attractive dividend but this will essentially come out of the growth you otherwise would've had"
2021-06-18 09:20:24,stocks,"5 year annualized total return (including reinvested distributions) for QYLD is about 11.2%

5 year annualized for straight QQQ is 25.9%.

Distributions aren't free money.  They sell at-the-money call options on QQQ, which means sometimes those options go in the money and get exercised, which means the NAV of QYLD then goes down slightly relative to the NAV of QQQ.

The more bullish the market, the more often ATM calls become ITM, so this strategy works better in bear markets, relative to the underlying asset."

It obviously depends on what kind of trading you are into and how much of your net is tied up in investments. Personally, I have seen our system scramble to bail-out or prop up corporations time and time again, crisis after crisis. If there is anything I'm hitching my wagon to it's the S&P and similar powerhouses. 


Corporations have won, they'll always get taken care of. If they have a hard couple of years policy wise, they get made full with a few more years of easy living. It's a repeating cycle making more and more money each time. 



I have zero worries about where the companies in my portfolio will be in 10 years. I just DCA as aggressively as possible and don't worry about the noise, I actually kind of enjoy when everyone is freaking out and I'm sticking to my routine."

2021-06-18 09:22:16,stocks,Yeas your definitions are roughly what is considered a correction and a crash. Swings and dips have no real definition. You never know what could happen so it’s always wise to reserve some cash for opportunities like this.
2021-06-18 11:47:47,stocks,"> What is considered a dip in regards to etf? 

Markets are kind of fractal... Change the timeframe you're looking at and the ebbs and flows are still there, but the size of movements change.  I don't know if there's a one-true-definition here.  And while we're at it, learn to put charts into logrithmic mode if you're looking at longer timeframes.  Otherwise everything that doesn't crash and burn will end up looking like a hockey stick.

> If you have larger amount to invest do you wait for that -5% period and risk the missed gains?

The rule of thumb is time in the market beats timing the market -- in other words, investing right away *usually* beats waiting for an entry point or dollar cost averaging into a position.

Now if you're moving money from one asset to another within the market... THEN you might consider entry points, assuming you aren't in a panic to exit a currently held position. 

It's a great rule of thumb, but you can still use your head with regards to these things...  Like when Covid panic was steadily ramping up in mid-Februrary 2020, it's good to realize that it could be one of those outliers.  You'd have done fine regardless, but waiting a month, you'd have made a killing."

2021-06-18 09:40:09,stocks,"Yeah, something like that although it depends on the ETF in question. I'd add a bit at - 5% but probably wait to - 10% before I started to deploy any substantial amount. A 10% sale is good enough, anything more is just gravy"
2021-06-18 12:30:39,stocks,Get up early check futures and base the dip at its lowest when the market seems ready to bounce green. Have cash to buy more if you can.. This is not financial advice just an observation..

2021-06-18 12:42:52,stocks,I always buy when it fell down 4% each time. That happens about as much in a year as I am willing to put money in the market. So 4% is a buydip for me.
2021-06-18 15:23:42,stocks,"I hate the thought of 'missed gains' because you only know what you know.  Everything is a risk anyways.  FOMO is poison.

I always think about what the reason for the dip is, and if it seems like there's justification to think the worst is over at a market level, macro and micro level of the stock itself, then you shouldn't feel dumb for taking a chance."

There's always more money to be had on the market and I'd rather make consistent trades with a defined profit/loss tolerance than trying to hit some magical 100%+ run up.

Sure I've had plenty of ""if only I'd bought X at Y price and held till Z"", but I get over it and remind myself that so long as I haven't loss my ass I always have new opportunities in the future.

I'd also add that if you're focusing entirely on how a single stock moves and worrying about what it does after you sell (unless you're hoping to rebuy in lower), you're doing it wrong. See way too many traders trying to predict exactly how a single stock will move up and down at any point and ignoring opportunities across the market."

2021-06-18 18:18:58,stocks,"Yeah, thats another pitfall I had to fight too.

If you spend $100 on a stock and it drops 10%. But you know it will go back 10% in the next month and another stock will go up 30% in the next month what should you do?

You should sell, take your loss and buy the other stock.

We have a desire to not ""lose money"" by holding until it comes back. But money lost is money lost. The past doesn't matter. Its only about the best place for your money moving forward."
2021-06-18 19:13:24,stocks,"That was me. I bought GME and AMC at the peak months ago like right before the huge dip. They finally came back up, and I got out right before the next dip. Made a tiny profit and definitely learned a lesson about meme stocks lol."
2021-06-18 18:22:07,stocks,I totally agree. Its actually easier fix the problem and get the desire to buy when the price is down then to sell when the price is high. I'm still working on that one too.

DCA isn't a magic bullet that is sure to make you money, as you unfortunately discovered. It works out a bit like hedging a bet. If you're right about the stock and it goes up, you still profit, but DCA makes you profit less than you would have if you went all in to start with. If you're wrong about the stock and it goes down, you still lose, but less than you would have thanks to DCA."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Another NVDA dividend question. So i basicall understand how stock splits work but im a bit confused for how this will work with 2 dates given by Nvidia being a month apart. 

So what is the benefit between owning the stock before the 21st of June and whats the difference with buying it after the 21st of June? That is just my question what is the diffrerence between buying before and after the 21st of June.

I understand that you own the same amount in form of value, just more shares now ( assuming price doesnt change)."
2021-06-18 08:43:47,stocks,From what I read I understand that technically It doesn’t change anything about the fundamentals of the company but a split may encourage more people to trade that company since will be cheaper raising the volume.
2021-06-18 13:02:43,stocks,I think the 21st is suppose to be the cut off date to be guaranteed your shares split.
2021-06-18 12:09:13,stocks,"It will work just like a cash dividend, except the dividend here is shares. So anyone who has 1 share on June 21st will be given 3 additional shares of NVIDIA on July 19th, regardless of what they do with their share after June 21. So the share price will go down 75% after June 21st since buying a share after that date no longer will get you 3 more shares, and all the shares are now diluted even though the additional shares will not be technically given out until July 20.

Just like how a stock drops after the cash dividend ex date even if the cash won't be given out for another month.

Edit: Idk what the downvote is for, this is the exact answer to the question... The benefit of buying before June 21st is that you are buying 4 shares, price will quarter after hours since after that date you will only be buying 1 share"

Edit: reporting on the split makes it sound like this split is not working like a dividend at all and that it will just split on July 19 like any other stock split, and nothing will happen on June 21. What I described is how a dividend is paid with an ex dividend date and a payable date which is how the initial reporting made it sound to me."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Intel Processor Market Share May Fall to New Low Next Year Due to Apple Silicon Intel may see its market share fall to a new low next year, in large part thanks to Apple's decision to move away from using Intel processors in its Mac computers and instead use Apple silicon.

As a result of the four Macs with ‌M1‌ and upcoming releases, Intel this year will lose 50% of its orders from Apple, and eventually, losing all orders from the Cupertino tech giant will lead to Intel's market share falling below 80% in 2023, according to DigiTimes.

However, Apple's in-house developed Arm-based processor series is expected to play the key role in taking a major chunk from Intel's share in the upcoming year, the sources said.

Intel is expected to lose nearly 50% of its orders from Apple in 2021 and will eventually obtain no orders from the client. Losing Apple's 10% market share and seeing AMD staying firmly with another 10%, Intel's share in the notebook market is likely to slip below 80% in 2023, the sources noted.

2021-06-18 16:50:50,stocks,"nope, you are looking at the wrong company. Apple is still a great company to invest in however! the big hurdle is still porting programs designed on x86 to ARM, many programs do support ARM but nowhere near enough yet to *really* start hurting intel. 

Intels main revenue source is datacenter and enterprise low volume but crazy profits. datacenter is always intels and AMDs primary focus, next is client computing, this is your computer, the chip that is still in your pc and laptop unless you have an M1 based apple product. theres more volume here, less profit but still again a lot of profit to be made. most of their total revenue is from this sector. 

what market does apples M1 chip currently cater for? its highly specific, their own products, and most of which is going against what intel consideres their client computing group. now its possible the M1 chip could do datacenter tasks, it does have ECC support however there's no memory modules in LPDDR4 that support ECC making the product totally useless for enterprise until then. 

not only that i suspect apple had an exceptionally good deal with intel for their chips, its very common for intel to provide hefty bulk order discounts to system integrators because in reality, but the silicon itself is also cheap the R&D is expensive. in reality, its not just apple they should be worried about, its ARM in general. is apple with the M1 chip is accelerating the transition to ARM away from x86? absolutly, but i dont think apple will be the one to capitalise on that because they like to keep their products to themselves, but once that transition has occurred, any arm compiled program would run on any arm chip (assuming its compiled for that OS) which is the bigger cause for concern

then you have AMD, who they should actually be significantly more worried about because they directly compete with each other in the same markets, and currently, AMD is absolutely on an R&D rocket. AMD is not just staying at 10% they are not staying still for intel, Zen4 from rumours sounds like it will compete against Alder lake just fine and when the move to DDR5 for consumers seems like it will be cost-prohibitive or totally non-existant by the time Alder Lake releases, which also needs significant scheduler changes in windows to be supported due to the introduction of x86 ""big.little""

apple is still only 6% of computer sales globally. unless they start taking more of that pie, the loss to intel is honestly quite minor in relation to their size and overall profits."
2021-06-18 18:37:17,stocks,"Intel still a monster
Ship is turning around under new CEO.

Only own 100 shares but keeping it"
2021-06-18 19:42:15,stocks,"Intels revenue from apple was 1% of their total revenue. Ouch ;-) 

Get your facts rights, don't klick on this garbage article"
2021-06-18 09:12:41,stocks,It's the second market they're losing after mobile chips
2021-06-18 09:08:48,stocks,Good for Intel to get out of that business. Focus more on foundry solutions
2021-06-18 12:24:25,stocks,AMD YES
2021-06-18 17:11:04,stocks,"Time to short Intel! But honestly, they keep losing market shares every month, so I would not be suprised of the stock falls when there is no longer a semiconductor shortage."
2021-06-18 08:19:37,stocks,"Other laptop manufacturers have added AMD cpus, Razed announced the Blade14 recently.
I like what Thunderbolt offers, but there is a reason other companies started including AMD in their lineup.
Hopefully Intel can make some advances instead of spending money on smear campaigns."
2021-06-18 17:01:09,stocks,In five years every consumer laptop will be on an ARM CPU.
2021-06-18 08:01:19,stocks,Intel is still a better value play than AAPL. Most AAPL value bulls are waiting for it to go to 50-60 or if the company shows greater growth 80-90
2021-06-18 12:53:40,stocks,"imo, it feels like the semiconductor shortage is the only thing propping Intel up right now.

I've been hearing nothing but a constant stream of bad news for Intel for years about new competition, and how Intel is either years behind on their promised released dates for certain products, or getting their butts kicked by the competition when you compare their products.

Intel is one of those companies that I don't care how cheap they get, I'm simply not buying it. I've heard way too many bad things about them from my very tech savvy co-workers who much prefer AMD & ARM processors. Their judgement has proven to be very accurate on this subject in the past (I would have made a boatload of money if I had bought into AMD when they started obsessing over it)."
2021-06-18 11:37:27,stocks,"Everyone is adding more capacity, chips are in higher demand. Intel is opening a new fab plant too"
2021-06-18 09:15:38,stocks,"Probably 10% of the CPU business. Only 2-3% of overall revenue. Especially with the chip shortage, it will be funny to see INTEL make more money because now they are selling those CPU's at full price to others instead of a discount to Apple."
2021-06-18 14:54:30,stocks,"More than that. They sold their whole wireless business (to Apple), then they sold their whole NAND   business so out of that market too. Probably been more ventures they retreated from too"
2021-06-18 13:33:18,stocks,"Smear campaigns is the last thing Intel did well, but now AMD is incontestably better than Intel and improving while Intel is staying the same."
2021-06-18 19:38:28,stocks,Err no....
2021-06-18 17:02:36,stocks,What about servers/cloud computing? That appears to be where the money is now a days. Iphones were already on ARM. I'm sure Intel would have loved to get that revenue but you can't lose what you never had.
2021-06-18 18:35:18,stocks,Depends if others are willing to put in the same money that apple did into research (or apple lets others license their chip designs).
2021-06-18 10:40:51,stocks,"Im not falling for that bull trap, its clear intel is in trouble so of course its cheap. Just because something is cheap doesnt mean its a good buy."
2021-06-18 08:05:34,stocks,I'd buy apple at 90. I have Intel now
2021-06-18 12:56:36,stocks,"They have a new CEO now though, one with impressive technical chops and the right combination of engineering and management credentials. And more obvious to the naked eye, they've made the right choices when it comes to r&d spending recently that will start to pay off after a few years."
2021-06-18 14:41:06,stocks,"If you mean the one in Arizona it won't be online until 2024 IIRC, while AMD has made prior comments confirming additional capacity coming H2 2021.

In the meantime AMD and TSMC aren't slowing down their node development, chip design, or advanced packaging efforts. 

Intel is relatively stronger in laptops since they can actually produce 10nm chips in volume there (I'll believe Ice Lake-S has good volume when they give real, unambiguous numbers in earnings), but I still think the only way AMD doesn't hit at least 20-25% in laptops is if they're capacity constrained from all the server and pre-built desktop share they're taking. 

AMD has doubled its laptop design wins YoY for the last couple of years in a row and they have hit above 10% in the past when their advantage was nonexistent in PPW."
2021-06-18 09:18:58,stocks,Im not sure intel was affected by the shortage. They’re in stock everywhere here and at a deep discount thanks to AMD. They’re an amazing bargain right now. That will change when Intel rewrites the x86 processor game end of year.
2021-06-18 12:15:03,stocks,"Over the past year they've started to make the correct changes neccesary to right the ship, also I believe one of their cpus represents the best value proposition for consumers right now. Their situation isn't great right now but I think the next year or two will be  a good time to get in. Id expect them to already be started on the ~3 year cycle to release a great cpu line."
2021-06-18 15:39:10,stocks,"*""Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."" -WB*"
2021-06-18 15:50:04,stocks,"If I had been worried about Geslinger (I figured it takes 2-3 years to start turning the ship regardless) I'm not after his sing-songy nonsense on the Q1 call and him approving whatever that was at their Computex show this year.

When Intel actually fesses up to their issues and eats the crow they get served as a result I'll start believing they're a serious threat again. Right now they're still too full of shit to even properly acknowledge they have competition, much less that they have major problems. If you just listen to their earnings you'd believe they have no competitors, any drop in margins or revenue is just seasonality, and their schedule has never slipped.

Firing Murthy was an underrated move though if even half of the rumors about his mismanagement and favoritism were true."
2021-06-18 13:43:04,stocks,"Too late, they should have poached AMD CEO and let her take the lead. Lol"
2021-06-18 14:42:26,stocks,Haha you referenced 10 nm. You definitely know what you're talking about.
2021-06-18 09:24:28,stocks,"Ya, my 5900x comes in the mail today. Always been an Intel fan till lately of course. But I wonder if the server market makes up for it. 

I haven't looked into it, are you saying I shouldn't be building now but wait till Intel comes out with some magic at the end of the year? Probably gonna take that long to get a damn video card anyway."
2021-06-18 16:36:08,stocks,What rewrites are you referring to? Any links?
2021-06-18 15:52:02,stocks,"I don't think you're wrong about the value thing, but ask AMD of 2008-2016 how being the value option works out."
2021-06-18 13:29:42,stocks,"I hear you and know theyre investing in their new plant, but the tech industry is fast pace and cut throat. Amd has surpassed expectations while intel has been sitting down with their thumbs up their ass for the last few years and are just playing catch up. Definitely a gamble when it comes to their revival. I personally wouldnt go all in but ill look at what they do in the next few months and throw some in."

The little cores are Atom based and handle OS background tasks and such and the big cores do the heavy work like games or number crunching.

2021-06-18 08:48:12,stocks,"I like this assessment. It’s simple, honest, and to the point. There are little brewing catalysts besides the options expiring today. You can say the NSCC filing is a catalyst, but I’m not 100% sure if it’ll even help all of the meme stocks at this point. I personally believe in a downtrend today though, as I think all or at least 80% of the calls expiring at $55 and below have been hedged for at this point. Short sellers have more than enough funds to probably delay buying back shares and just opt to eat the yearly interest."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

2021-06-18 14:36:18,stocks,"Contrarian view, but I think this rotation into tech, especially high growth/risk, is very premature and not terribly thought out. In the 3-5% inflation world we’re heading towards it just doesn’t make a lot of sense for these stocks to be surging right now.

I’m not a market bear by any means, I’m now fully invested in a number of companies (thanks huge pull downs of the last two days!) like CLF, DAL, DOOR, VMC, BA, GAP, BAC, STZ, etc. Companies who will profit massively from this new inflation friendly policy view and reopening spending surge over the next two years. I also just bought some SMH as I think the semis have been beaten down terribly for no particular reason.

I loaded up on some more DIS. And still bag holding CRSR, PLTR, and two SPACS. ME (a former SPAC) is finally showing movement now that the merge went through. BMBL, ZNGA and OPEN continue to do nothing and I'm flat with those. And lastly, still bag holding TSLA bought at the top but it's starting show signs of life again.

2021-06-18 17:25:30,stocks,I wonder how much in “speaking fees” Bullard got from the big money bears to say that completely useless speculation about “fed rate hike might come in 2022” BS. I guess people stopped listening when yellen cried Wolf for them so they had to find a new manipulative bitch. It’s funny because neither of them have any say in it and the only purpose their dumb announcements served was to spook (manipulate) the market.

2021-06-18 19:28:58,stocks,"Only way to win in this market is to hold, when talking heads on TV are spreading max fear and the markets bloody that’s when I just buy more and deposit money to slurp up the discounts. Every red day is just a long term discount on good stocks and the indexes"
2021-06-18 10:30:18,stocks,"Last time yellen increased rates the market reacted amazingly. People who think they know what will happen are usually incorrect. I’m just saying that increasing rates can be spun anyway you want, it’s suppose to cool of equities - pretty sure corona was suppose to do the same instead it was a fantastic year."
2021-06-18 10:34:40,stocks,"We may be pleasantly surprised by how reasonably the market takes tapering changes from the Fed, whenever that time comes. It could be awful, but it’s equally plausible that aside from a minor correction the markets will react positively to projected stability."

2021-06-18 15:52:27,stocks,If you are listening carefully: You are either being straight manipulated to do their will or recognize they like us have no fucking clue what is going on. The job of the news is to get views/clicks not to be right.

2021-06-18 13:03:40,stocks,"Baba will have its time in the sun again the company is doing very well so is JD. People not buying these because they are either Xenophobic or racist is honestly extremely foolish, when baba and JD take off it will be swift.

2021-06-18 11:03:27,stocks,"According to Bullard, the timeframe is 6 months. The timeframe is slowly creeping up. Then when supply chain is resolved, Iran starts producing oil again, semiconductors are back in stock, all of those scary numbers will look a lot better. There will no longer be doom and gloom of inflation. I wonder what the next narrative will be?

Assuredly all of this will occur once retail investors have been scared out of their positions and large institutions have bought up the fear. They will kindly let you back in for a premium."
2021-06-18 11:30:10,stocks,"I think it's a solid long term play, they keep expanding their services and are getting their name out there with stadium sponsorships.etc

I just hate the volatility at the moment as it is slightly a meme stock due to Chamath. 

I would buy around 20 dollars if you can."
2021-06-18 11:54:02,stocks,Bought KO few months ago at ATM and I am still positive even after this drop. Great company and I figured if all those senators are holding it and Buffet loves it… what do I know that they don’t. And their dividend is great.
2021-06-18 11:38:15,stocks,"They are a huge company, they make way more than cola. It’s a good buy in my book."
2021-06-18 11:42:17,stocks,"Feels like a ""sell the news"" situation for banks/recovery plays now that the Fed finally actually said something about rate hikes, rather than rumors."
2021-06-18 12:14:25,stocks,"Yup, all of them, looking at some ALLY leaps since my January 60c's are burning. Had really solid growth, good technicals, solid foundation for future growth and good recent PT's, no real reason for this massacre the last few days."
2021-06-18 11:52:43,stocks,Just bought C
2021-06-18 11:47:53,stocks,Yea. Im buying. Best to do the buying at a time people are running for the exits. Especially since banks pay dividends.
2021-06-18 11:47:41,stocks,Depends what you are trying to buy.
2021-06-18 12:40:50,stocks,"JPM is 10% down from ath now, time to start buying incrementally."
2021-06-18 12:12:49,stocks,"Today is a good day to buy banks, they got massacred yesterday and this morning over this nonsense, BAC, JPM, C, ALLY have all taken some big shots in the last day and half and are solid buys right now. Remember, inflation isn't going to magically end and the fed WILL increase rates sometime, so invest now and banks will benefit down the road."
2021-06-18 13:44:06,stocks,"I might be wrong but i think they are rotating out of overvalued commodities (due to inflation, so things like coper, steel and lumber and things related to that). and materials and back into tech stocks."

2021-06-18 06:45:00,stocks,Go for it. I see Etsy getting back to 200 after how oversold it was. I think I'll get back into etsy today.
2021-06-18 09:35:24,stocks,"We're at 0% right now so.....DUH?  Even if they raise 4 times in 2022 we'll be at a whopping 1% next Christmas.

Delaying until 2023 was always a stupid idea."
2021-06-18 09:48:50,stocks,"They have a huge stake in BAC. Something like 11%.

So that explains some of the move."
2021-06-18 09:48:20,stocks,">BRK

don't know why anyone would want to buy them. Buffet failed to follow his own principles and buy the dip during march, and brk is consistently outperformed by the s&p. Its holding mostly cash in a short term inflationary environment. Its gonna plummet and it deserves to."
2021-06-18 10:58:54,stocks,"So he can knock down the market, incidentally enough on expiration Friday. CNBC really keeps milking the narrative. I think they must have mentioned it about 10 times in an hour. Then very casually they mention that he isn't even a voting member until 2022. We have time, however the markets are forward looking 6 months, so...."
2021-06-18 11:00:31,stocks,"He didn't say anything new.

A 2022 hike was on the table from the last meeting."
2021-06-18 14:24:02,stocks,I like it better actually
2021-06-18 15:25:04,stocks,Yea the market is acting like the economy is fucked for the rest of the year right as we are starting to reopen.
2021-06-18 15:35:12,stocks,"Careful though.  I mean you do you and Im not disagreeing, but someone has been buying CDOs of toxic commercial real estate.  And someone is buying the CDSs on them.  Until you or me can figure out who that is, I just think the big and bigger banks are very risky.  Banking consolidation is coming, just like in 2008.  Some of these names wont be around by 2024."
2021-06-18 15:33:53,stocks,"XLF breaks the trend line, but there may be a bounce since banks are soooo oversold"
2021-06-18 19:45:03,stocks,What about that ITUB bank people are talking about?  Apparently whales are buying calls on it like crazy?
2021-06-18 19:07:31,stocks,The yellen who cried Wolf isn’t working as well for them anymore so now they are trying it with Bullard now I guess. Fucking clowns

2021-06-18 09:14:48,stocks,"sure they are, sooner or later. just need to get a dip in on googs so i can get the tip in"
2021-06-18 09:35:25,stocks,for £100 I can tell you the date they will split.
2021-06-18 09:52:43,stocks,So the institutions can sell off today
2021-06-18 11:33:47,stocks,same -- it's so different from March-April-May where each red day was just dipping further.
2021-06-18 11:58:38,stocks,Some fucktard from St Louis decided to open his mouth last night. This is a reaction to that.
2021-06-18 12:02:10,stocks,"What you're describing is definitely not what occurred outside of March 4th, and I thought my memory was bad.

March FOMC: The Nasdaq in particular spent the entire day before the Fed statement was released down a percent, but stable after the first 30 minutes or so. Once that statement was released, those losses on the day were gone in like 10 seconds and I believe it jumped as much as 100 points before closing 50 points up. The Dow and S&P closed at records on that day.

But on the next day, yields soared, the Nasdaq went and posted a -3%, and the Dow had something like a 350+ point reversal to end down half a percent.

April FOMC day: There was another spike higher but it wasn't as crazy as that one, and it was reversed. Then on the next day the broader Nasdaq set its first intraday record high since February and then threw it away completely before finishing slightly higher.

I know, it doesn't fit the narrative, and it's odd that I can remember this, but in the latter case, I was so frustrated by that."
2021-06-18 13:09:05,stocks,"I was planning on buying NVDA right before they announced the split. When the split was announced, I didn’t buy in because it was already up like 4-5% in pre-market. Jokes on me cause it just kept going up and up.

Definitely wish I would’ve just bought in then but now I’m still waiting hoping for a “sell the news” type of dip when the split becomes official. But man idk, i’ve already left a lot of gains on the table by waiting it out. This thing might just keep on ripping. I realize this isn’t helpful at all lol…."
2021-06-18 12:46:04,stocks,"""Bank of America Global Research raised its price objective on the computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software company to $900 from $800 and reiterated its Buy rating.""

Likely is not dropping too much in the near term.  Overall price per share will drop after the split, but it is the same valuation."
2021-06-18 14:02:51,stocks,"Ya, what's up with PYPL? Are you going to sell or hold?"
2021-06-18 14:21:53,stocks,amat is having trouble getting back past its 50 day average around 131.85 today. It may drop more by close and over the weekend especially if people are left to stew over the Fed's throw away comments at close. I think I'm gonna wait and see if it rallies a bit more or it falls farther before buying.
2021-06-18 13:51:24,stocks,you buying more nvda at these valuations? Its like buying tsla at 900$ in feb.
2021-06-18 14:40:17,stocks,"When I was looking at the big US banks, JPM has the best financials (return on investment, free cash flow yield, etc)"
2021-06-18 14:35:51,stocks,"Bank-backed funds are basically ETF's and many are doing well, but these are not exactly bank ETF's as you're probably looking for.  Most invest in sectors (utilities, global, etc) and are heavy dividend stocks (some monthly).

All the individual bank investments in my portfolio are down.  Not panicking (yet) and also do not feel now is the time to sell profits elsewhere to buy back in."
2021-06-18 14:27:54,stocks,"Not FA bla bla, but i think its a poor time to get into banks."

2021-06-18 07:32:50,stocks,I see absurd PE ratios like 60-100 in Chinese equities. Even the stock valueinvestors like the most in China BABA is trading at a pe ratio of 26 while it has been undervalued in the past at 16.80
2021-06-18 08:41:00,stocks,Nice hair
2021-06-18 09:02:03,stocks,"Probably get them cheaper sometime next week. 

What tech stocks want to do won’t matter until the Dow/cyclicals are finished drilling 6 feet into the ground. Wait and see how that index reacts to 33k, as it looks like it has a date with it very quickly (not today, but early next week)."

2021-06-18 10:22:17,stocks,"I would either do just VTI, VTI+VXUS, or VOO+VXF in addition to QQQ. Heavy overlap between VOO and VTI but you can use VXUS for international or VXF for mid/small cap exposure to supplement one of them."
2021-06-18 10:02:25,stocks,That dip is almost certainly a placebo effect in terms of what you're looking for. But it shouldn't hurt you either.

2021-06-18 11:37:47,stocks,"Never personally been a huge fan.  Think you can make some money on the stock because of the brand, but as an actual home buying platform there are much better options out there."
2021-06-18 13:47:49,stocks,"Shares held in platforms that fold need to be transferred to another platform/brokerage or cashed out (at whatever terms they dictate, usually strike price whenever executed).

This happened with Loyal3, which might have been the original Robinhood style platform.  Became popular around the time of the GoPro IPO and a few others.  Benefit was fractional shares.  Downfall was could not set limit purchases and execution times were not guaranteed.  

When it folded, everything had to be transferred to another brokerage account before a 6 or 8 week period of time or else your shares would be cashed out and you needed to deposit into your bank within X amount of time."
2021-06-18 13:47:39,stocks,"Not stupid at all. I am not too clear on robinhood specifically but most brokerages have some sort of insurance to compensate my broker is insured up to 250k per account. Also some brokers hold your stocks in an independent clearing house so you might be able to keep your stocks. You can google for more information on RH.

Its not a bad idea, it is dependent on your risk tolerance, strategy and goals. I would suggest getting a broad market index fund instead if you are just starting out"
2021-06-18 14:16:32,stocks,"Just being honest here, you probably need to alter your mentality a bit.  There arent often going to be 'no brainers'. A lot of people work full time jobs to stay on top of no brainer investments.  

Each and every investment carries risk of it going down and no one, especially not reddit, knows which way a stock will go. 

If you're new, load up on a combo of a sp500 tracker and a world market tracker.  Then paper trade individual stocks for a few months.  Get used to researching companies and making informed decisions, listen to podcasts, read a book or two.  Get used to being wrong and get a feeling for when you can hold during a downturn and when you feel like you need to get out of a trade.

Learn how to do your own research as taking reddits advice on this sort of stuff is more likely to lose you money."
2021-06-18 14:09:20,stocks,"Lots of holders taking profit or breakeven right now driving the volume.  Many tied up with them for years with little to no gain.  

I'm all for biotech, but this one is still bit of a risk.  Needs to skyrocket with successful Phase 2 into a Phase 3 to make profit.  Cracked $6 once in 2018.  Have to go back to early 2000's for significantly higher per share prices.  

They're not an all or nothing investment and doubt they would be acquired by another company, likely license if successful.  Have an exit strategy if getting in."

2021-06-18 19:24:42,stocks,"TLT options.

However, tbh I doubt that TNX will be above 2% within a month. It should stabilize again eventually though.

Regardless of what TNX wants to do, there's probably going to be a day fairly soon I would think where the premarket suggests that non-tech is going to be an absolute bloodbath while tech isn't hit as hard, and then it shifts intraday like May 11th, but in the opposite direction."

DOW stocks look like Nasdaq when inflation news hit in Feb and people started taking profits and rotating into reopening/value. Now it seems they are taking profits from reopening stocks and going back to growth/tech. So consider profit taking. CAR had a pretty amazing run and this could be a sign to move on. You could use the profits to buy back at its new bottom or try new stock positions. Unless you are already seeing a loss.

2021-06-18 16:57:44,stocks,"It depends on your risk tolerance.  I was looking into covered calls for AAPL and MSFT and any price that was 2-3% above the current price had a negligible premium.  For me, it wasn't worth selling covered calls to make less than $10 with the risk of being forced to sell my shares if the stock jumped.

I have some other positions that I do covered calls on.  These are stocks or etfs I don't care if they get sold.  QCLN is a good example of that."

Record years for spy were all in 5%+ interest rate environments and when they were being raised. It’s just FUD for the FUD cannon, when retail starts winning and getting more involved the shake outs get more intense. Banking benefits from higher rates which is why they are trying to force the feds hand, they are sitting in trillions to buy some imaginary crash they are hoping for, so they are wanting a rate hike to cause them to earn more money and create panic so they can buy up the crash. That’s why it’s up to smart money to ensure they never get to, I’m looking forward to fin tech putting all those dinosaur bear bitch banks out of business. In 10 years most of them will be gone and fintech will dominate. Karma is a bitch, even more so for evil bear scum"

And raising rates after the financial crisis was hardly a success.  They only made it to 2.5% before quickly dropping again, and their balance sheet tightening lasted less than 12 months.  This market is unsustainable without Fed support.  Good thing that we can keep going like this forever, right? 

Finally, the fact that it was a fantastic year in spite of Corona might cause you to ask yourself if this is normal or healthy."

But that play is at least a year off.  It's coming, my current car loan is handled by that market.  It cost me almost $100k to get a nice $30K car loan, but at the end of it, I get my $100k back, my $30K back, and make money in the end while owning the car.  It isnt going to be that way forever, but for the early adopters it is.  In the future, hopefully, a 30% stake of the 100% loan is all that will be needed.  In the end, you'll own the car.  You'll earn with your 30% deposit that will offset the costs of the other 70%.  You might end up paying 50% of the total cost of the car since you were making money on the stake.

Key word here is 'stake'.  And not a single bank was ever involved.  Hell, it might end up being you that lent me the money.  And this is why in 10 years, so many of these banks that are late will be gooooooone."

Rarely do I care if a stock drops 1-10% total after I purchase.  When it sits at the 10-15%+ drop for weeks/months is when I become concerned that I made a bad decision.  I'd love to time a dip and buy at the record low, but it just does not happen."

They'll likely be taking actual losses if people are really behind on mortgage.  Evictions can take several moths/years, plus backlog, and could be 2-3+ years.

Completely agree. I understand most people are scared by higher risk, but I feel like there is a lack of perspective.

2. Buying a medium-risk, undervalued Chinese stock with 30-40% margin of safety

The stocks of terrible companies like WKHS, FSR, M VIS, and others are sitting at or near ATHs despite being in bad economic shape and with terrible revenue generation. The only thing keeping them afloat at this point is retail investors who expect to win big by screwing short sellers. In other words, companies who *should* see their values tank are seeing them explode upwards instead, utterly defying the normal confines of price discovery and supply/demand. 

On top of that you have clear pump and dumps going on too, where people flood into companies with small market caps sending their values soaring, which fuels momentum chasers and algos, who send these stocks even higher.

However, the short float is quite huge at almost 22%. What am I missing? What is the bear case for Corsair? Did they have profits just because of the pandemic?"
2021-06-18 09:29:46,stocks,"The sectors that Corsair competes in and gets the vast majority of its revenue from are low-margin, commoditised products like memory and PSUs where everyone just rebrands Micron/Samsung/Superflower products. The only small advantage they have here is the brand, sustained by massive marketing spend. All of the acquisitions they've done are tiny and don't shift the needle on the bottom line. Elgato is probably the best business they have but that's tiny.  
Look through the financial statements going through history, and you'll notice that historic gross margins have stayed around 20%,and net income margins float around 0%. In 2020, net income margins were 6.1%. All of that increase (and more) can be attributed to the  700bp increase in gross margin. They have no operating leverage whatsoever.   
The key to this investment is whether that increase sticks around - not the PE firm, or meme potential, or growth of the wider gaming industry. If all of those go right, but gross margins go back to historic means, CRSR WILL NOT PRINT FCF.  
My view of the gaming market is that the past year has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for component makers like CRSR. The demand was so high that they could gouge prices and increase margins, but that's not going to stick around forever. I haven't seen a compelling argument for gross margins continuing to stay where they are.  
Arguments like Elgato having higher margins, or debt all being paid off in the future simply don't have big enough impacts to alter the fact that gross margin is the linchpin."

add that to the main point of their markets having razor-thin margins people are likely expecting they will have too much surplus overall which is a terrible thing in a market where the profit is so thin

maybe another factor is lockdowns are starting to end and people aren't locked inside all day, during lockdown, there was a surge in gaming, so that bubble could pop

That said... I think if they have 1 or 2 more incredible quarters, this will speed up the process and we may see the price push higher even through the selling pressure, as the fundamental value of the business will clearly be higher than what the shares are being sold for.

Not sure what you mean by 'high end' market either.

The problem with insider selling is the share dilution. Say the company grows by 10% a year but every year they release 10% more shares. Than the revenue or earnings per share is not growing at all. Thus my share is not increasing it's fundamental value and I own 10% less of the company each year.

If a company issues new stock, that dilutes your shares so you own, but the proceeds of the sales of the new stock do not just go to a specific insider. They are now funds for that company. So if Corsair has 100m shares worth $50 each, Corsair is worth $5bn market cap. If they issue 10m more shares, that dillutes each share's % ownership, but corsair now has $500m more cash (if they sell for $50 each) that they can use to grow. So each share is now a lower % but it's of a company with more cash on hand (which is more valuable than the same company without said cash).

For me both are good companies and will grow on the future, at the end it's a choice of cost-oportunity and in my case I also try to stay away from anything that is being extremly pumped on certain subs.  


Note: The inside ownership in the last 6 months has been cut almost to half..."

It's just a bit weird to imply a company is over valued without looking at any of the financials. It sounded like you were specifically talking about Corsair since that was the topic, but I could have misunderstood."

2021-06-18 15:50:17,stocks,"First off all, iCue is not a basic RGB ecosystem. It is arguably the best PC RGB ecosystem; although it is completely proprietary.

I don't know the details, but they have been talking about selling subscription software services to streams probably related to their streaming hardbard.

It is impossible to say it their streaming software business will take off, but iCue is a fairly impressive software product, and subscription software services can be extremely lucrative."
2021-06-18 17:06:28,stocks,The answer to that should be pretty clear from what I said before.
2021-06-18 10:47:58,stocks,Not talking specifically about your post but the dozens of posts a day across all subs referencing short squeezes in the title. It's why I generally stick to the smaller investing subs

A vast majority of entry-level, cheap peripherals are from the same manufacturer. Some have gone away for good or are bought out by larger companies, it's just labels and stickers at a certain point."

That's where. Until that I wasn't talking about you. You're not the first and not the only corsair shareholder. A lot of them get real mad. Also nobody except maybe you is implying it's overvalued. Well that and a lot of analysts. And shortsellers. And many armchair retail investor analysts. 

But if you see a statement that X is possible in the world, and immediately apply it to yourself that's pretty telling. Or are you saying it's impossible for a company to be a good company doing well and be overvalued? Are you saying that's impossible, or is it possible? Give a straight answer!"
2021-06-18 16:08:45,stocks,"You're surprisingly upset about me calling iCue exactly what it is.  All of the rgb software options out there are garbage.  If corsair offered truly quality products and iCue was the best software option out there you would have a leg to dtand on regarding iCue, but they don't.   There stuff is ok.  If someone asked what the best ram, cases, fans, or other hardware was Corsair is not the first thought.

So you don't have any links or hard evidence of these discussions?   How can a service that has no documentation of ever even being in the talks ever take off?"

It's a very peculiar thing to do. 

Clearly we don't agree, but derailing the topic because you don't like when someone points out a huge flaw in your argument (that you say Corsair is over-valued while also saying you have never even looked at their financials), is just a bit petty isn't it?"

Then go ahead and explicitly say it. Explicitly state that it's impossible for a company to be a good quality company and overvalued at the same time. Go ahead, do it.

Also I never said corsair is overvalued, you're the only one saying it. We're not even talking about corsair anymore, we're talking about random hypothetical any company. And since, as I said, I have not looked at the fundamentals, I will not say wether they are good or bad, which is what you bagholdingly keep demanding of me."

If you talk about what those other guys use, you have to use the same number, earnings, not revenue."

**It might be good but just wildly overvalued at current market cap.**

**It might not be good but just wildly overvalued at current market cap.**

Both of these end up making you say that it's wildly overvalued. Therefore, you said it's wildly overvalued, Regardless of whether it is good or not. Sentence structures can be hard, I understand. Maybe you meant to say:

**It might be good, but it may also be wildly overvalued at the current market cap.**"

This thread is no longer talking about CRSR, it's talking about English and grammar, and the meaning behind statements made. All I'm saying is the way you worded your statement it's very easy to interpret it as you saying you think it's overvalued. I just provided an alternative way to say what you said that would better infer your intent."

2021-06-18 03:24:02,stocks,I don’t think we will crash but we might see a pullback. There are always people talking about a crash but it rarely happens and if it does most of the time it will quickly bounce back up but i think you should wait a bit to buy in the or options on the S&P 500 we are almost at ATH and you should never buy in at ATH. There will always be another Pullback or Red day. One rule that really helps me not to fomo in to some play is „The Stock market is a device for transferring  money from the inpatient to the patient“ -Warren Buffet.

It goes up much more frequently, and with a net upward trend in value. If you just buy and hold, you get all the bad days, but you also get every good day, and that tends to be better in the long run. You only need 4 or so holdings to have a great diversification, depending on your risk preference. It all depends on what you're trying to do."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Time to bet against Facebook? First let me point out that I don't have any positions in Facebook.  I did however apply for options trading on Fidelity today for just this reason.  Btw, is it just me or do those option prices look steep?

TL-DR: I think Facebook is dropping hard in the next 4-6 month.  YouTube is screwed as well, but I won't bet against Google.  I know FB has a ton of bright people working for them, but Apple is attacking their business model and it seems to be working.

Little background here.  I work for a D2C (direct to consumer) company and am very involved with marketing spend allocaction, analysis etc.  Basically Facebook has been a boon to these types of marketers for the past couple of years.  We spend on avg 400k-600k per month in Facebook advertising.  It's very profitable until late May when Apple fully rolled out iOS 14.1.

iOS 14.1 is essentially a first strike attach against FB & YT.

Perhaps you've seen the latest Apple ads toting how great they are for privacy.  Here's what's really going on.  Advertisers like FB & YT are able to make money by tracking user behavour to deliver ads that will convert.  Apple decided to throw a huge wrench in their business model....and look like they are the champion of privacy at the same time - genius.  Seriously, this was a master stroke move.

Here's the reality of what I'm seeing and have heard the same from other marketers.

Facebook & YouTubes advertising platforms are basically broken.  I mean campaigns that we have run for 6mo's just stopped working.  We are cutting spend by 50%.  We want to spend more, but we can't justify it.  Not only that, but it's getting more expensive.  I'm not sure if this is due to other parties trying to spend their way out of the poor performance or FB increasing rates to make up for advertiser drop off.

Not every company has in depth analytics like we do.  Some can go months before they realize that they just burned a pile of money.  Side note - this is great for companies like Pinterest that are intent based.  Similar to how search works...they know you are interested in certain subject so they send you relevant ads.  Also, Google search campaigns are still performing well.

Here's my view on what's happening w/FB & YT.  If an iOS user upgrades to iOS 14+ they are automatically oped out from being tracked on the apps they use.  I don't know about Safari, but f you launch FB or YT on your iPhone then you look like a brand new user from an advertisers point of view.

Serious advertisers use a funnel approach to FB advertising.  Top of funnel (TOF) is used for brand awareness.  Bottom of funnel (BOF) is used to target people who interacted with your ad.  BTW, an interaction could mean you hoverered over the ad, not just clicks.  With this new reality, advertisers cannot re-target iOS users on FB and YT effectively for BOF ads.  This is huge.  Now we're stuck with some basic demographic targeting for ads with no intent data points.  It's like every FB user who has opted out of tracking looks like a brand new user with not history.

From FB & YT's point of view - every iOS user has no historical data to use in targeting.  You still have your friend list and YT subscriptions, but they can't use that data to target ads.  This might be fine for brand marketing but it doesn't work for performance marketing.  Performance marketing means we want you to interact with the ad and buy something.

Now let's talk about attribution.  When FB/YT delivers you an ad, they will track whether you eventually bought the product - think the normal window is 28 days.  This means if you see an ad for a t-shirt, then go to the t-shirt company's website a week later and buy it...FB/YT take credit for the sale.  Now a good marketr knows that FB/YT doesn't deserve all the credit.  You may have advertised to them on some other medium...but FB/YT does deserve some credit.  If they hadn't seen the ad on FB/YT first they would never have eventually bought the shirt.

iOS 14 iis changing this as well.  I think the window is 7 days now...but might be less.

My ompany's sales are down 35% since iOS 14 rolled out.  Not only that but our FB/YT spend is down approx 40%.  In fact, I remember before the rollout happened our FB rep reached out to inquire what our spend budget was going to be for the year.  This is not normal.  Usually these platforms make you come to them and beg...they never reach out...and never ever for a budget plan.  We told them we planned on spending the same unless performanc changed..  Well, we're cutting spend by 50% and I have to imagin we're not the only ones.  Don't get me wrong - we want to spend more.  It's just not working out.

Also, has anyone noticed how much stock Zuck has been selling lately?  I think he's already doubled last year's number.

Oh, and FB nearly hit their all time high today.  Really, how is this possible.

BTW - I have not interest in placing bets against Google.   Who in their right mind would place bets agains both of those giants.

Here's my guess w/FB. I think they will come in a little low on earning on 7/19.  They have been increasing rates and traditionally they are the best place to advertise.  Howver, I think the cracks will really show on Q3 earning and continue to deteriorate in Q4.

My question is - if you had 20K-40K to invest in this scenario what would you do?  I'm thinking put options winter 2021 or Jan 2022.  Im assuming the stock is going to drop a \~\~hundred\~\~ $30 bucks between now and then.   How can I maximize my play with this set of assumptions?

edit - Thanks for all the responses.  I've decided to wait to buy put options a week or two before earnings if the FB performance issues aren't resolved by then.   I would not be surprised if they took a 5% hit on earnings in Q2 and provide guidance for 10% reduced earnings in Q3.

There's a lot of stuff going on in that company, and it's not all tied to FB ad space.

I'm not saying you're wrong, as I probably log into my FB account once every three or four weeks these days (same with most friends).  I'm just saying it's a *very* busy company doing a ton of different things."
2021-06-18 06:00:59,stocks,"Not a financial advisor but I am also in marketing and the ad issue is a major, major problem for FB. The entire ad industry has been flipped on it’s head and I think more ad dollars will flow to influencers & curated content (like youtube video plug). So the dollars will go past fb/yt and straight to influencers. 

I would think it could hit their bottom line really hard, but again I think it will slowly become noticeable to investors.

2021-06-18 02:16:40,stocks,"They can make an ad campaign showing iPhone users being smug about the privacy. Being the “not fun at a party” stereotype. Even show all the cool kids rolling their eyes after saying “oh, very cool Mr. Achtshually” or make it like it’s a paranoid boomer thing with their users wearing outdated clothes, accessories and toys.

Then show all the Popular people with cutting edge fashion they claim they got cheap deals on. “Oh Mr ackshually, I never see you at the trendy parties anymore what happened?”

Just show them all missing out on all the fun stuff society peddles. Could even black mirror it where the apple androids are super nerdy and paranoid and try to shelter their users. While the marketing friendly androids are also fun and are like best friends feeding you cool ideas about fun stuff you’d like.

I don’t have a strong opinion on the topic, but you can see I’m skeptical about how much people really care if their ads are made less effective on them. This will be popular with the conspiracy and minimalism crowd, but that’s not really apples brand. Only the politically engaged crowd moderates (small group) will feel smug about not being manipulated"
2021-06-18 03:13:40,stocks,AAPL is also overvalued. Valueinvestors are looking to enter the stock at 50-60$. If AAPL keeps buying back shares and starts growing at a faster rate and getting towards a lower PE then some consider buying it at 80-90$ but nobody who is holding for years would buy at the current price.

Op you can buy puts.  Or invest in competitors
Since you are in advertisment, where do you see the money flowing.  Amazon ads have been growing.   Youtube is the biggest media platform.   Snapchat?  Pinterest?   That advertising money has to flow elsewhere if its not going to fb.

There are some companies like Shopify that might get screwed since they rely so much on small businesses and Facebook advertising so shorting them might be a good idea if you believe the apple changes are going to be significant. 

So really the only thing this will do is increase the revenue Google/FB gets from big companies while small business gets pushed out. I doubt this will hurt either stock significantly."

2021-06-18 01:25:48,stocks,There's a lot that goes into option pricing but yeah IV is usually the X factor with these things. What's more important is the IV percentile for deciding whether they're relatively expensive or not. 100% would mean they're at a high and 1% would mean a real low.
2021-06-18 07:51:18,stocks,I think float and velocity of movements (related to IV also) have a big effect on option pricing. Apple rarely has 2 to 3% swings
2021-06-18 07:02:04,stocks,Facebook has already come public with a statement that what Apple is doing won't meaningfully hurt their profits. This public statement is important  because putting it on record can potentially set them up for shareholder class action lawsuits if they are wrong/lying.

You better believe either someone at FB or someone at a third party tracking company is working on it. As for if it’s possible, your guess is as good as me.

Either that, or there will be a small shift in marketing as a whole. I agree with the guy above saying that influencers are going to see an increase in usage. But I still think a majority of spend is going to funnel towards digital as a whole. I’ve worked with non performance marketing brands, and their budgets haven’t changed at all.

There's a pretty huge audience that doesn't watch TV. So depending on the target market, TV ads would be a complete non-starter. I still recognize the bear case of losing SOME ad revenue, but that news is old and I'd argue it is already priced in."
2021-06-18 13:41:30,stocks,"I'm aware, that's why I don't think it will hurt FB too much. Their revenue sources will just change to Instagram, possibly Oculus (though that's more long-term), as well as from bigger companies."
2021-06-18 11:43:19,stocks,"The impact just started over the past 3 weeks.

Before iOS 14 was implemented their reps reached out to all big advertisers to find out how much money we plan to spend on platform for the rest of the year.  This is HIGHLY unusual.

We told them we plan to spend the same as long as performance remained steady.  

If all your customers told you that they planned on spending at the same levels wouldn’t that justify telling your shareholders that there will be no impact on revenue?"

2021-06-18 08:39:39,stocks,"TV works with our target audience to a certain extent.  The problem w/tv is calculating attribution.

I agree w/your point of limited channels to advertise. Facebook & Google dominate the space.  I’m actively looking for new channels to test.  Heck, we’ll probably give Reddit a try.

Imagine there are 100 companies that you compete w/in Facebook marketplace.  Previously all 100 have varying levels of success b/c FB targeting is excellent.  IOS 14 comes out and now only 75 of the 100 are able to make FB work, and all 100 have a reduction in performance.  

If the 25 reduce their spend by half - how does FB maintain their advertising revenue?  They can increase their rates, but this just causes more advertisers to have reduced performance.

The only way they don’t take a hit is to figure out a way to get back to their previous level of ad targeting - or find née customers to compete in the market.

There are a ton of VC backed companies that will still advertise b/c they are trying to grow top line revenue - so maybe the impact will take a little longer to show up.  But IMO FB revenue will start to decline unless they are able to get back to their old levels or targeted ad performance."
2021-06-18 12:36:37,stocks,"Maybe so, but you're also ignoring new sources of revenue. I think they announced recently they will start advertising on Oculus VR. They also have yet to monetize WhatsApp, so there seems to be more than one way they can make up for any lost revenue due to iOS 14. You're going to do what you're going to do, but I think betting against Facebook is a bad move."
2021-06-18 13:04:41,stocks,"long term I agree with you.  I'm going to continue to monitor the situation and make a decision a few weeks before earnings.  Put options will be cheaper by then and i'll gamble on a bad reaction to a 5%-10% revenue miss over the next 2-3 quarters.  Not going to risk alot - just really curious if my theory is correct.  Of course even if it is correct, who knows if that moves the stock that much."
2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,"$ASAN Current Stock Price Analysis - Expect Downtrend Soon **Ticker:** ASAN

**Company Summary:**

Asana, Inc. operates a work management platform for individuals, team leads, and executives in the United States and internationally. It provides a work management platform as software as service that enables individuals and teams to get work done faster while enhancing employee engagement by allowing everyone to see how their work connects to the mission of an organization.

**Bullish Signs:**

* Founded by Facebook co-founder (left in 2008 to start Asana) who just bought $70m in shares on 7 different buys at average of $43/share in the last two weeks. Partner is ex-Google executive, so they know their tech.
* [Dollar Retention Rate YOY was 115%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/04/why-asana-stock-popped-today/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article), meaning last year’s customers spent \~115% more this year to continue using the product / expand their use. Sign that current customers not only like the product, but want to use it more.
* [Revenue projections](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asana-rises-revising-fiscal-guidance-112157591.html) were recently increased by 5%, from \~$314m to $340m for FY2022.

**Bearish Signs:**

* Without owner’s continued purchases, the stock would lose a lot of momentum and return to a more normalized volume/price.
* $230m in revenues and -$210m in [net income](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/asan/financials/cash-flow), but now a $9b valuation. Doesn’t add up, can’t be sustained.
* Has set a new All-Time High almost every day for the last two weeks. Correction seems overdue.
* Above the upper Bollinger Band (shown in image reference), which is a big sign it is oversold and likely to return closer to the current mean ($40.34), even if the company performs well in the long term. Went down significantly within 2 months the last time it went above the Upper BB.
* RSI above 90, meaning it is oversold and should return closer to the mean soon.
* Revenue increased by $85m last year, but marketing expenses increased by $84m and total expenses increased by $142m. Basically, every $1 spent on marketing only brought in $1 in revenue, which is awful for any business. It is especially bad for a product that doesn’t have long term contracts and easy access to market for competitors. However, we’ve already determined current customers seem to like the product, so maybe spending a lot of money to get new customers is good for long term growth.
* July Put/Call Volume is basically even (shown in image reference). Stock went up huge in June on a .16 P/C volume ratio, but the next 30 days are .99 P/C ratio. In June, 7x more people were betting it would go up vs. down, now it is even for July. Will be a lot more downwards pressure in the next 30 days if stock buyers/sellers match that ratio.
* Accumulation vs. Distribution is (literally) off the charts, 3x higher than a month ago. This isn’t the kind of stock that people will just hodl forever. Eventually, these people that have had 60% gains in the last two weeks will sell for a profit and the spike will end.
* [StockTwit overall sentiment is -6%](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ASAN), with many of the bullish comments admitting they are probably going to take profits and rebuy soon. Rather unusual for a stock that has gone up so quickly, so sentiment seems way down.

Any opinions on the short-term outlook for this stock that I am missing?

I've been wrong before and maybe this thing just goes up forever, who knows? Not advice, but I would probably set some type of limit sell and just make sure you get out on the way down while still riding any upside that is left."

2021-06-18 10:58:27,stocks,"Whatever you're comfortable with! I like 5% increments. Eg. If I'm up 10%, I'd set a limit at +5%. If I go up to +15%, I'll increase my limit to +10%. Etc. Gets you out within 5% of the ""top"" and doesn't stop your upper limits. Could possibly catch a bad swing day and get forced out before another run up, but can never be mad about taking gains!"

KRUS (Kura Sushi) - Is simple to understand so no need for me to explain. Unit growth is fast and they are still very small. So each unit make a huge splash. They are also the market leader in their specific service specialization... though there is competition, there are literally no other major sushi chains. They are it and I would venture to say that the reason for that is sushi is very hard to do at scale. They obviously figured it out in Japan, so they are doing here. Also, prior to COVID, they were already profitable not just per store, but company wide.

OTGLY (CD Project Red) - Despite the nay sayers and emo kids who think a single bad game will derail an entire business, these guys doubled their business size the last 2 years. But, due to very long cycles, this hasnt shown up in their earnings yet. Further, their stock got hammered due to a questionable game release (as if the other companies never had one). So its a perfect storm of stock being cut by about 60%, them doubling in size, and extremely long  profit cycles. In about 2-3 years, their rev will start to consistently show double historic levels and will stay that way moving forward. Oh yea, they are also profitable so no chance of collapse."

2021-06-18 01:43:34,stocks,"I hate to be the nay sayer but I really dont think its going to happen fellas. Nuclear is just pointless now. Solar is already cheaper per kWh on the generation side in many states and the price is still falling. Wind is also getting cheaper every year albeit its not as cheap as nuclear yet. Plus both have a much smaller up front cost thus you can build better redundancy and build closer to point of demand (less transmission needed and fewer points of failure).

With nuclear, not only do you need to mine the mineral but you also need to enrich it. Both non trivial. And then you need to build a big bass plant to use it and you create 1000 years of waste every few years. And oh yea, the plant requires crazy amounts of cooling, has a very high operational cost which only increases over time, and there is always the chance for major catastrophe especially if you hire Homer Simpson. None of these problem exist with wind or solar... not even if you have tons of battery banks. They are so easy to service, relatively speaking, that you can do it with high schoolers.

There is literally no upside nuclear except in areas where you have low sun hours and no wind (or usable rivers) and cannot possibly run long range transmission. But where is that exactly? Alaska perhaps? Definitely not Hawaii. So we are doing all this for Alaska alone? We cant just get a permit from Canada to run a transmission cable?

Before you say there are limits to batteries, ill cut you off. You are wrong. People who dont understand chemistry misinterpret the meaning of ""rare"" elements. Rare doesnt mean we dont have enough it. In fact we have plenty and not just plenty, but we also have alternatives especially in batteries. But ""rare"" is a relative term, not an absolute one.

For example, on earth, carbon is exceptionally rare compared to more common elements like Silicon or Aluminum. Does that mean we have a practical shortage of carbon? Did you know that Lithium is actually more common than Lead and about as common as Nitrogen... the same stuff you pee every day or so? We have plenty of Lithium and odds are we wont be needing it for long anyway. My money is on flow batteries for home and grid. Those will likely use Vanadium which is twice as common as Copper and 6x more common than Lithium but 3x ""rarer"" than Sulfur (see what I did there ;-p). Its just semantics. And we can still use other types of chemicals if we wanted to.

And no, recycling batteries and panels is not an issue. The issue is tooling recyclers because they arent set up for it yet, not the actual process. The process is obvious and well known and highly efficient. Most everything in both panels and batteries can be recycled with little waste and they are not very toxic either, comparatively speaking, to nuclear.

Just my 2 cents. Best of luck fellas."

One word: intermittency. Solar generates power only when the sun shines and Wind only when the wind blows.  Neither are suitable to power the grid, they can't be used as a baseload source. You need a baseload power source such as Coal or Nuclear. Nuclear is the safest and most energy dense power source we have. Solar and Wind will never be an alternative for Nuclear. Basically Nuclear energy is the future of energetics. Solar and Wind are just temporary distractions. They are like a child's toy in comparison.

2021-06-18 08:52:55,stocks,Most of their revenue comes from non crypto.
2021-06-18 16:16:47,stocks,"Why between 2019 and 2020, China installed 30% more solar/wind while increasing nuclear 2.4%?"
2021-06-18 02:11:07,stocks,"""... none of this is true, ...""

Wow thats a pretty absolute statement you made there. By all means. Make a logical argument. I am all ears.

The rudimentary research bit was hilarious btw... I almost spit out my tea ;-p"
2021-06-18 10:14:29,stocks,"Nvidia absolutely ruled the GPU market with an IRON FIST for over a decade and the stock just chilled at 10-15/share.

Crypto goes off the fucking rails and NVDA skyrockets, even despite beginning to lose market share to AMD which had until recently been basically Nvidia's (and Intel's) idiot cousin. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck..."
2021-06-18 09:57:55,stocks,"? How do you figure that?  Their largest, fastest growing segment is gaming GPUs which is a segment that is almost entirely priced in correlation to ETH prices.  It doesn’t matter where the cards go, their pricing power is based on demand from crypto.  Even their data center GPUs are being priced by crypto demand to some extent.  

The effect of ETH mining on NVDA’s profitability is gigantic.  I don’t think investors have really gotten wise to the extent that this is so.  Just wait till millions of 3060’s come on the market when EIP-1559 hits, then again when ETH moves fully to PoS.  If you do not know what this means then you should be staying away from NVDA."
2021-06-18 16:39:54,stocks,Because solar/wind power projects can be completed in months while nuclear power plants takes years-to-decades to build.
2021-06-18 17:22:58,stocks,Because nuclear plants take longer to build. China plans to more than triple nuclear energy generation by 2030 from the current 42.8 GW to 150Gw.
2021-06-18 02:29:52,stocks,"Well, you can listen to literally every single commodities fund manager in the market today. The men and women who have all built multi billion dollar portfolios for their clients, and who have each spent decades in this exact profession. All of whom are on the nuclear wagon bandwagon, and all of whom can explain in excruciating detail exactly why solar and wind are inefficient and lackluster energies. I have not heard a single academic expert of any credibility ever posit that solar could overtake nuclear.

We can talk about how uranium, including the mining and processing, is still the most efficient energy source by KW/hr by far. We can talk about how it's the safest energy source, with less deaths than oil, solar, or wind, per KW/hr by far. We can talk about its global range, going places solar can't even begin to compete. This includes the entire northwest, from Oregon through Canada, not just Alaska. And I'm just looking at the ability to provide energy at all, and not the fact that it provides more energy, for cheaper, and safer, in every area globally, from Alaska to Arizona. 

We can talk about how nations across Europe, and even more so in China, are ditching solar to aggressively expand nuclear energy, because it's cheaper, safer, and more efficient.

 You say make a logical statement, but literally every single person who knows energy is on nuclear. Make a logical statement as to why it's a bad investment."
2021-06-18 15:57:17,stocks,"The other areas going off the rails is datacenters, EV, AI...

There are simply a growing number of computational problems being solved with the massive parallel processing capabilities of GPUs."
2021-06-18 18:34:54,stocks,That makes sense. Thanks
2021-06-18 03:28:53,stocks,"Ok cool so lets discount all the fund managers off the top. We all know they are doorknobs who barely keep up with an index fund on average thus are about qualified as a monkey on a dart board to talk about anything scientific. Its like asking a car salesman what they think of Teslas no dealership model... many still believe it will fail... lol.

Next, if you havent heard of a scientist telling you solar + wind can overtake nuclear its probably because you dont hang around science folks. Nor do fund managers. Well you have one now telling you that in about 10 years, wind + solar will likely reach nuclear capacity in the USA.

And thats just the USA. Worldwide, this will be done in about 5 because other countries are ahead of us (China... cough). You do realize nuclear is just like 10% of worldwide generation right? And that wind + solar is already 7% and growing by leaps and bounds... this isnt even a comparison. 5 years ago we were generating about 700TW from solar, today its about 1800TW... In the same time, nuclear went from about 6500TW to 6900TW... Im not even counting wind. If you go back 10 years, the numbers are even worse. Back then we barely had about 100TW of solar and we actually had more nuclear than we do now...

The death rates are silly. I mean, that should be obvious. Any death from solar is likely due to, sadly, working on roofs. This wont happen with giant solar farms. Can you imagine the death rate for nuclear if people did it at home?

Your efficiency numbers are outdated. Check again. Solar, when purchased wholesale rather than retail, has been cheaper than nuclear for well over 5 years and running in sunny states. It is now A LOT cheaper due to advances in panels and can be brought to parity with nuclear even in less sunny states. Now the problem is that when you include batteries, then the price climbs above nuclear but for how long?

Panels keep becoming more efficient and cheaper every year by about 2% and batteries are in their infancy... i mean 5 years ago it would cost well over $1/Wh for battery storage, and next year Ford is releasing a F150 with likely well over 100kWh for about $40k... 2021 Teslas model 3 is about 82kWh for $40k. The prices are in free fall and the tech is no where near done in terms of improvement. We probably have another 10 years for panel innovation before plateau assuming absolutely no new breakthroughs and another 20-30 years for batteries. In 10 years, solar + batteries will be so cheap that they would even make sense in low sun areas.

Further, you need to account for current cost of nuclear plants... this is something people dont consider. Nuclear plant cost is not what it used to be and many calculations used today are based on those old costs. Its possible that old plants might be cheaper than solar/wind (not always) but you cannot, in any way, build a new one that will be cheaper today. Why do you think utilities arent rushing out to build them even in low regulation states? Yet they are all building solar/wind farms and battery banks in droves...

I have no idea where you got that China and Euro info about them ditching solar for nuclear. Please give a citation. Hell just today there was a report of damaged fuel rods in China lol. Further China already generates twice as much from solar/wind than they do nuclear. Between 2019 and 2020, China installed 30% more solar/wind while increasing nuclear 2.4%..."
2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,"#AMC500K is the biggest pipedream I've ever seen on here. Do people really think one AMC share will be worth half a million dollars? I hate how confident some of these posts are.

Like they seriously want people to believe 500K a fucking share of AMC? And someone will pay them that much? Ok. Sure. Let's roll with that..

Let's assume all the funds and brokers get their trillions liquidated and then dispersed among all of us. 

...What do they think will happen to the rest of the market? 

Again, this is assuming everything goes the way they claim, which let's be real, it ain't. We'd be lucky to see a few hundred, let alone 1000. 

Why? 

Because people **will** sell. 🤦‍♂️🤔

If you think the whales are here to get the little guys their tendies... The ones holding lots of shares are the ones selling us calls and CSP's and making money off of each date that is set for AMC to do anything other than roll around like a fish outta water. 

This shit is a cult at this point and it's ridiculous the kinda shit I see being posted here, and even worse on their own sub, like honestly, it sounds like a straight up cult. I can't wait to see the sheer amount of people who are gonna be left suckered and holding the bag because common sense is too hard I guess. 

500K lmao."
2021-06-17 22:52:35,stocks,AMC isn't even worth what it is now. I'm glad people are making money but as some point it's going to crash hard and leave a lot of people broke.
2021-06-18 06:58:50,stocks,"I think it will hit $1 billion a share.  

See how easy that was?"
2021-06-18 00:16:16,stocks,At 500k a share the capital gains taxes wouldn't be able to be collected because there literally isn't enough money in circulation to cover it.
2021-06-17 22:50:28,stocks,"People who’ve been screeching about 500K a ShaRE simply don’t have the slightest idea of how the system works.

Do I believe it can squeeze? Sure. Can it squeeze high? Maybe, we’ll see.

But I’ll be damned if it goes beyond 3-4 digits"
2021-06-18 02:08:27,stocks,"If Berkshire Hathaway did it then so can AMC....

All jokes aside you all here are really missing the point. Obviously no one legitimately believes AMC will hit 500k. But them saying it will brings more attention to the stock. It got you talking about it so its obviously working.

Now its at an all time high.

Personally I got in late at around low 40s and sold at 60 but as long as people know when to get in and get out its easy money."
2021-06-18 11:59:02,stocks,"It is completely cult like at this point you don’t even need to speculate on that anymore. Twitter, the amc sub Reddit’s are just massive echo chambers that are nothing but the result of group think. You won’t find any amount of reasonable discussion when you ask any questions and all of their “DD” is insane confirmation bias. One DD that was linked to me which they consider “highly regarded” contained a Twitter poll as their means to extrapolate that retail investors owned hundreds of percents of the float, it was absolutely insane."
2021-06-18 07:02:09,stocks,"here's the way I think about it, if the short squeeze happens we're essentially in a real life 'prisoners dilemma', it's in everyone's best interests not to sell for as long as possible, but no-one knows who's selling and individually there's a strong incentive to sell... so setting a very high floor helps by price anchoring

if people thought the floor was $100 then they might sell at $80 or something, cause they've only missed out on a little per share... but if the floor is set at 500k, even jokingly, it encourages everyone to see how high it'll go rather than cashing out early, and everyone ends up better off as a result (except the short sellers of course :p)... it also gets attention and might bring in more speculative fomo buyers, which would help the odds of a short squeeze 

so I guess just don't think about it too much, buy and hold for a bit of entertainment and a potential lottery ticket if you're so inclined... gme and amc to the moon yadda yadda"
2021-06-17 22:49:11,stocks,Aye thats honestly good for us if they are a 500k cult means we have a better chance of getting out before it crashes
2021-06-18 09:44:41,stocks,Until the shorts have been covered we will see how high it will go. It may not get to 100k because people like you will sell at around 90 to 100 bucks per share. And if the shorts have not been covered it may keep going up even after you sell. It all depends on the 80 percent investors holding and the squeeze effect unfolding.
2021-06-17 23:14:26,stocks,The only one that has a chance of hitting 4 digits is gme
2021-06-17 22:54:01,stocks,"Your points are based on if people sell @ 100 right ?

What happens if no one sells ?"
2021-06-17 23:52:40,stocks,"I feel bad for these people. They have been brainwashed by some dude on YouTube or TikTok. I don’t know if it’s true or not but people have claimed to put their life savings and more. They are being tricked by these whales. And once it does come crashing down they will be so fucked up in the head. I’m referring mostly to the younger, Gen-Zers, which are the most sensitive generation statistically, they wouldn’t be able to handle such losses and possibly take their own lives. It’s really scary."
2021-06-17 22:51:58,stocks,"Do not use logic, common sense, intelligence or facts to attempt to understand anything 4chan related. Everything they do is For Teh Lulz of The Cosmic Joke™️"
2021-06-17 23:40:44,stocks,"As I have said on other posts about these meme stocks, in order for them to actually realize profit  someone actually has to buy the stock they own at the price they ask. Yes, some will get thier money from executed options and such but a large portion of people will be stuck with thier stocks because nobody will want to buy it"
2021-06-18 02:24:18,stocks,"AMC is a distraction to pull people away from GME. The funds didn’t pay their lost bets. They have to when they eventually run out of ammo. It’s really as simple as that. Superstonk has DD that is basically a PhD thesis, they have uncovered all the criminal tricks that they have used so far. AMC is all over the MSM while they are afraid to even mention GME just like superstonk predicted months ago. AMC booming plus a media blitz and suppression of GME is a planned move. Just my opinion but it’s not an uninformed one, this shit is backed up by months of deep research by hundreds of thousand of people from all different backgrounds. I’m happy to see counter DD but no one ever gives it, they just say it’s a joke and remain ignorant."

2021-06-17 23:39:44,stocks,"I’ve been posting a similar message on a few YouTube channels (I think you know which ones I’m referring to).

It’s inevitable... capture gains, and buy back in when it drops.  Maybe we’ll get lucky and it will go back again."

2021-06-18 10:18:54,stocks,AMC is officially a commodity stock now. The idea is that there is more demand than there is supply and as soon as the short position covers it will boom like shovels in a gold rush. The thesis of high value is based on scarcity.

People who hopped on for the squeeze back in January and have stuck around since are learning about the company as a whole and are optimistic about its prospects. Like a growth stock. Sure there's a lot of meme magic there, but I think referring to it as solely a meme stock is reductive/dismissive and ignores the other factors that have let to its meteoric rise. 

Another reason for its violent boom this past year has been because the price had been and continues to be artificially depressed via illegal tactics such as naked shorting. Here's an article from Reuters that came out the other day where the president of the NYSE said that the price may not reflect the demand: https://www.reuters.com/business/meme-stock-prices-may-not-properly-reflect-demand-nyse-president-2021-06-16/"

With 500 million shares in circulation, the number of sellers is going to massively overwhelm the number of people who have the capital to buy in at that price. Stock prices don't go up by magic, it's all supply and demand.

The other problem is that a lot of the major price action so far has been due to call options that were purchased in the past forcing a gamma squeeze as the sellers of those options are forced to buy back the calls or shares to cover those positions. With the IV and call option prices so high there just isn't the capital available to retail traders to force additional gamma squeezing on AMC in a cost effective manner."

Only thing retail have done is hold a lot of shares that normally should be moving around everyday. 

To say theres no public data that proves hedge funds are illegally naked shorting shares is a pretty obvious thing to say because if there was accessible public data that proves it then they wouldnt be doing it would they lol. Also to say everything from the vote to whatever was wrong just means you havent read any of the dd presented in gme or superstonk.

2021-06-18 02:28:26,stocks,"Nothing really says that shorts have to cover, other than whatever margin requirements their broker is enforcing on them. When I checked my broker earlier today there are still lots of AMC shares available to be shorted and the borrow rate is just 2%, which is actually quite low.  The opposite of ""shorts needs to cover"" that apes conveniently ignore is that longs need to sell if they want to take profits, and in the process of selling they will tank the price. This means only the people who sell first will be the ones to reap the profits, and everyone else will be left holding the bags.

In theory if everyone holds their shares and people keep buying, yes the share price can go insanely high - but in that process nobody can sell and nobody can take profits. It might make for a nice screenshot, but until you sell the stock is not cash in your hands and can't be spent on anything. In reality, people are going to sell because retail traders are not robots and everyone has their price. At the high prices only a few people can sell before the share price goes down again, so it becomes a game of chicken where 99.9% of the people holding aren't going to be able to cash in at anywhere near the peak.  A lot of people at some point are going to be left holding a bag, so if you are smart you won't be that person."

The comment I responded to literally said they were going to have a great earnings because millionaire apes were going to buy out stores. That kind of blind fanaticism is what's so off-putting from the outside looking in. Surely you understand that.

As far as skins are concerned, steam has had zero trouble monetizing this realm so far without the influence of NFT. Before that, this market was being achieved via eBay and PayPal even though it definitely broke terms of services. So while I do see the benefit of NFT in possibly streamlining all of this, I have a hard time seeing why GameStop is going to insert themselves into the profit of this specific thing to any large degree. They're looking to solve a problem companies are already solving.

But I do understand what their execs look like these days, I do understand that they took advantage of this whole meme whirlwind to get out of debt and get into a larger cash position. While I do believe that massive windfall has absolutely nothing to do with fundamentals or high IQ business strategy, I do think it was a no brainer play that moves their timetables up immensely, and gives them options they didn't have before.

I certainly wouldn't be the first person to be doubtful about a company's future that ended up being great in the future. I'm not a genius. I just can't envision the same future you can."

&#x200B;

>and everyone they poached only left because they got huge promotions.   
>  
>Nobody is willingly making a horizontal move from Amazon to Gamestop. 

Come on, man. That is one of the main reasons to leave a company. Very few people will move laterally unless they hate their current job. A very lazy point here.  


>And just because someone works at Amazon doesn't mean they're an ecommerce wizard. If you truly believe that, then just buy AMZN.

Amazon is not in a rapid growth stage anymore. Why would you pick up a company that has been trading flat despite stellar earnings since 09/2020?

Amazon needs to think about transitioning into a dividend company since the market saturation is approaching. Their Prime is no longer 2 days guaranteed, and Amazon is worried about running out of new labor. Why is this a company we should invest in? They currently cannot keep up with their current logistics, much less scaling further.

Why should I invest in Amazon, if they cannot keep up with their labor demands?

>I find it highly amusing that everyone on superstonk seems to think that the ""pivot to ecommerce"" being successful is already a forgone conclusion just because they've made some management changes. If poaching market share from Amazon was as simple as firing the CEO then Amazon wouldn't be Amazon.

It isn't a foregone conclusion, but the executive team is stellar. Ryan Cohen stole already market share from Amazon and raised a company in an area people thought was impossible to be successful in once before. The market cap is currently around $30-35 billion.

Cohen is now poised to do something similar, with a denser distribution network, much more capital, and a very marketable name. It is literally easier to pivot Gamestop than it is to bootstrap Chewy. The fanaticism of superstonkers is just a bonus.

&#x200B;

>Currently, Gamestop has the same market cap as many tech companies that have already shown they can be successful and have rapidly growing revenues, while Gamestop is a shrinking company. 

Gamestop Survived the lockdowns without having to pull serious measures to stay alive. That is much better than pouring money into the furnace of a tech company that may never be profitable (Uber anyone?) 

Gamestop is a much better base to launch off of because its business model allowed it to stay alive when most companies were dying. At one point last year its stock price was less than its cash-on-hand. That is what is really hilarious.

>If you're investing because you think you can make money in the short term from a short squeeze/gamma squeeze/upward pressure from apes/whatever then I solute you, but I'm getting tired of people pretending like the stock isn't massively overvalued on a fundamental level.

What do you think, \*on fundementals\*, is gamestop worth at a market cap?

Their cash-on-hand alone is $770 milion

They have been on record to expect to sell 5 million shares around $255/share (no  hard upper limit) Which will bring a cash equivalent of $1.275 billion

Their cash-on-hand alone is $770 million GameStop worth at a market cap?p to $420 million and a maturity date of November 2022. it also includes a $200 million expansion feature. That is another $620 million.

They also maintain LOC worth $38.2 million.

Their other assets total $1.276 billion. 

Zero short-term debt, the only loan they currently hold is with the French Government ($48 million) and can be extended for five years. 

SO, with these all added up, assets, cash, and credit facilities, minus the loan, GameStop has $3.9 billion of readily accessible capital.  

At a current market cap, is it really that unreasonable to trade at 5x your accessible capital?

But, tell me, based on fundamentals, what is your valuation for Gamestop? Gamestop is a much better base to launch off of because its business model allowed it to stay alive when most companies were dying. At one point last year its stock price was less than its cash-on-hand. That is what is really hilarious

>Also Microsoft has partnerships with countless companies. That's not a big deal.

A revenue share partnership is a pretty big deal, especially if you are pivoting to an online sales market (Xbox) and into the PC market online and physical.

2021-06-18 19:46:49,stocks,"> Matt Francis, Elliot Wilke, Jenna Owens, Matthew Furlong, and Mike Recupero are quite a few poachings. Their resumes are fantastic, and if you look at the executive team as a whole, in the words of Cramer, ""I can understand why you never should've shorted this company in the first place.""

Five people is literally two more than ""a few"" poachings. And what do you mean their resumes are ""fantastic""? Are we checking Linkedins now? They better have some pretty good stuff on there if they're being hired to literally run a company lol. But seriously, neither of us have any idea whether they're actually good or not so let's cut the bs. 

> Come on, man. That is one of the main reasons to leave a company. Very few people will move laterally unless they hate their current job. A very lazy point here.

It destroys the narrative that Gamestop is a particularly appealing place for executives to work. FAANG companies poach talent from each other all the time, but for Gamestop to do it the promotions have to be particularly enticing. I'm not saying that it's a mistake but Gamestop is taking employees who weren't super high up and giving them the keys to the company. It's a risk that may or may not pay off.

> Amazon is not in a rapid growth stage anymore. Why would you pick up a company that has been trading flat despite stellar earnings since 09/2020?

LMAO its revenue grew nearly 45% over the past year, while Gamestop has been shrinking for the better part of a decade. I brought up Amazon because it's ultimately going to be Gamestop's main competitor if they truly want to transition to online retail.

> Amazon needs to think about transitioning into a dividend company since the market saturation is approaching. Their Prime is no longer 2 days guaranteed, and Amazon is worried about running out of new labor. Why is this a company we should invest in? They currently cannot keep up with their current logistics, much less scaling further. Why should I invest in Amazon, if they cannot keep up with their labor demands?

You should invest in them because you think five of their former mid-levels employees are capable of turning around a failing business into a rapidly growing one. Clearly, if Amazon's level of talent is as incredible as you seem to think, Amazon is going to be unstoppable.

> It isn't a foregone conclusion, but the executive team is stellar. Ryan Cohen stole already market share from Amazon and raised a company in an area people thought was impossible to be successful in once before. The market cap is currently around $30-35 billion.

Ultimately, Ryan Cohen is one man who created a very successful business in a space that had much less competition than online video game retail. That doesn't mean he is guaranteed to turn a completely different one around. He's also not even the CEO so it's difficult to say how involved he will be, but it won't be the same as with Chewy which he started from the ground up.

> Gamestop Survived the lockdowns without having to pull serious measures to stay alive. That is much better than pouring money into the furnace of a tech company that may never be profitable (Uber anyone?)

Uber is an extremely overvalued stock, but at least their revenue is rapidly expanding every year.  

> Gamestop is a much better base to launch off of because its business model allowed it to stay alive when most companies were dying. At one point last year its stock price was less than its cash-on-hand. That is what is really hilarious.

This doesn't make any sense. They're trying to completely change their business model. The stores they are about to shutter won't even provide a capital boost because they're rentals.

Just going off of Finviz stock screener, there are only two companies in the Consumer Cyclical sector with a >10B market cap that have a greater P/FCF ratio than Gamestop. One of them is amusingly Chewy, which averaged over 50% revenue growth for the past five years and is currently profitable. The other one is Starbucks, which is one of the most solid businesses around when it comes to profitability. Even if you think Ryan Cohen and his five Amazon employees are enough to justify doubling the value of the company, it still isn't worth 50 bucks a share."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,Wash sale rule Could someone please help me understand this better? Last week I sold my position in blueberry for a little profit (very little) after the memes finally pushing it past my average. So yesterday I decided to throw some more money in at a lower average than the first time and I noticed my cost basis was much higher than what I thought it should be. Obviously my unrealized gain/loss was in the red but I'm just not really grasping the concept here.
2021-06-17 21:07:49,stocks,"If you have multiple lots, but sold above the average price of the lots, some of the lots sold at a loss, and some at a profit. 

When you bought the new lots, the cost basis is rolled in with the lots that sold at a loss, because those lots are subject to the wash sale rule."
2021-06-18 07:48:36,stocks,"jesus christ, the explanations here suck.

Wash sale rule is a tax accounting law that prevent people from selling an equity at a loss and claiming that it's a loss and then buying back the same exact thing at a lower price. In other words, you can't have your ""loss"" and still have the same ""asset.""

So when you sell for a loss, either you sit without the asset for at least 30 days to avoid triggering the wash sale rule. Or if you decide to buy back the asset, the broker's accounting system will list your basis as if the sale never happened and that you never realized that loss. 

if you have multiple lots of stock and some sold for a profit while others sold for a loss, the broker's accounting system will retain the basis from the lots sold as ""losses"" and use it to calculate your current basis when you buy back in at cheaper price. 

So if you sold 50 shares at a loss and then bought 100 shares at a lower price, your first 50 current shares are still counted as that original basis and then will be averaged with the remaining new basis of the extra 50 shares you just bought. when you finally get rid of the shares you hold, thats when you realize any loss."
2021-06-17 21:05:30,stocks,"Wash sale applies to selling for a loss, not a profit. Sounds like an issue with your app/broker."

2021-06-18 17:13:30,stocks,thats just the averaged cost basis of all your shares minus the current price you sell at. It's not a wash sale issue until you sell to realize a loss and then try to buy back shares at a cheaper price than your last sale.

2021-06-18 17:49:27,stocks,"Unfortunately I learned the hard way that isn’t the case. If you sell at a loss within 30 days of purchasing shares it’s a wash sale, regardless of if you buy back.

They initially removed the wash sale, but ultimately they concluded it was a valid wash 

Appreciate the response tho. 

Edit: I should point out that the wash sale rule may not be triggered if you sell ALL your shares within 30 days of purchasing. In my situation with Ameritrade, i only sold some and held on to others. In my current situation, I would be selling everything so wash sale may not apply"

look for the 'beta' of a stock, which measures volatility relative to the market. 

the market as a whole has a beta of about 1, which is what you'll get from a total market or S&P 500 index. +1 is more volatile, -1 is less volatile. 

Tesla is a hotter stock, beta of 1.36 (36% more volatile than the market). 

https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla

compare with some of the stocks suggested here. 

WM has a beta of 0.72

and JNJ has a a beta of 0.64

It is slow and boring, but patience is their game and that does mean missing some opportunities while waiting for their moment.

As a retailer trader it’s much more acceptable to take on that kind of risk than it is for BRK. What if the unprecedented global pandemic actually left stocks depressed and stagnant for years? At the time there was no reason to be so sure the dip would be short lived.

BRK is not really geared towards maximizing the value of each position at any moment. That’s not what they are for. They don’t swing trade, the hold mostly steady companies and don’t usually take major changes to their positions.

Now ironically they did kind of make some interesting and major structural changes. They consolidated in Verizon and BoA, expanded into pharma and trimmed some of their other long term financial holds. But the goal isn’t to quickly take advantage of the current market volatility. The goal is to build a fortress that performs well over decades long horizons"
2021-06-18 11:06:25,stocks,"Market crashes are generally unprecedented. And it wouldn’t really matter if stocks stayed down for a longer period of time, Brk would’ve probably bought near a low if they did anything.

2021-06-18 11:12:18,stocks,"I disagree. The cash pile is waiting for the right move. That takes time, patience and due diligence. It’s not meant to be used for a fire sale. What happened in March last year was effectively everything was in a fire sale for a few months. At the time, we did not know how long pandemic would last, lasting ramifications, and no company had a major lasting change to their fundamentals that would make Berkshire see them as an appealing target for the cash pile.

They made moves. They made money. Berkshire did not just sit with their thumbs up their ass doing nothing. But they didn’t deploy the elephant gun so to speak. And just because they didn’t deploy it last March, doesn’t mean it invalidates the idea that they have a huge cash pool waiting for the right opportunity to capitalize on."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Why I am Bullish on $GEO Hi guys,

I have been digging into GEO and I am here to know your opinion about it. Despite the high debt/equity ratio I performed a fundamental analysis and I think this stock could have tremendous upward potential and a short squeeze seems inevitable. Hence, these are my reasons:

• GEO is a REIT that invests in private prisons, mental health facilities, electronic tracking devices, and secure transportation.

• This stock has an extremely low P/E ratio (6.32).

• The Price/Book is near 3/4.

• In the last four years the company is not diluting any shares.

• The EBT Margin remains constant for a long time.

• The management changed recently, and the insiders have been buying a high number of shares.

• Despite it is a REIT so it must pay dividends, these dividends got cut to pay some debt.

And here is where the things get interesting: The market price of the stock decreases 74% of its value since 2017, and it has a short ratio of 55% of the float. Also, there are only 800k stocks available to short. So, all the conditions seem to be met to a huge, short squeeze.

I’m not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice so you should do your own diligence.

Current position: 1000 shares @ 6.17$"
2021-06-18 01:35:15,stocks,"GEO is in fact a value play (my opinion) for the aggressive investor. I did thorough DD including DCF with sensitivity analysis and Multiple Approach and came to the conclusion that there is huge value (talking IRR +20% over 10 years min) to be found.

Please consider, this is the worst case scenario (government ban incl. - 40% on revenues and - 50% on FCF). Of course there is additional tail end risk (bankruptcy). 

BUT

there is big refinancing risk involved. for everyone interested take a look at their outstanding debt and map out the maturities until 2030. Refinancing of debt for 2024 and 2026 is crucial. But I am positive about this: think about it - Banks finance war, tobacco, alcohol etc. they don't care about ethics, they care about profit. As long as GEO generates cash, banks are going to be paid back. GEO gets loans. Everyone makes money.

Disclaimer: bought GEO on the way down at 7 USD share (750 shares) - stay safe and do your own DD (open the 10ks!!!)"

It's easy when a stock you really love drops under you because you can buy more at an even better cost. However, what happens when a stock you love runs on you before you can enter? 

Example: the stock has been consolidating and is at $100. You think it may hit $90, so you watch it. Then overnight it runs to $110-$120. How do you justify buying it at $120 when you could have entered yesterday at $100? You wait and hope it retreats back so you can enter. Then it runs to $120-$140. The cycle repeats. You missed it.

I rather feel devastated about blowing my opportunity or I eat crow and buy at a much higher price still knowing I blew the opportunity. The few times I've done that, it of course then retraces and I'm stuck in the red - again devastated only now feeling like a fool as well. So, I usually just never enter the position at all and walk away all together and stay cash. 

Any advice? How do you handle it?"

If it is higher and I saw the price rise in the future, while I feel sad that I didn't earn those money, it is risk I am not willing to take so I will not feel too bad about it.   


If price currently is lower than my limit and I believe it will drop price even more, I will also consider buy a portion now, and wait and see in the future. I believe the term is call dollar-cost averaging. Overall I might not earn as much, but I will not lose as much too."
2021-06-17 20:16:05,stocks,">You think it may hit $90, so you watch it. Then overnight it runs to $110-$120.

You chalk it up as a lesson learned. You can't predict the movement of stocks. The only thing you can do is act on current information. You can't act on future information that you don't possess. If you think it's worth 100 but you think it would be great if you could get in at 90 then you can either buy with half of your capital and see where it goes or you can sell puts. If I put in half of the capital I've set aside for this stock (2.5% of my portfolio) and it runs up and is now 3% of my portfolio I usually just leave it alone. If I didn't like the price enough to put all 5% in at 100 then I'm happy with the gain. If I have 100 shares or more I may sell out of the money calls if I think it's.over valued. 

If you didn't buy any and it jumps I guess.you missed the boat. There are other opportunities

You should be able to do security analysis and know what the price should be. That will help. If you don't know what price you are willing to pay then how can you judge it's value?"

2021-06-17 20:45:11,stocks,If Im long equities it’s because I like their books and business. I only buy companies I foresee growing into their space and expanding. I can be a bear too.

I want a seat on that rocket ship even if the admission price is higher than before. I buy businesses. Not lines on a chart. You’ll get to understand your companies and space a lot better over time. If you currently don’t have domain knowledge you should seek to obtain it. It will help temper your feelings around price. And you will truly start to see what is a discount vs not. I buy high sometimes. And sometimes I buy at -35% discount. But it’s all because the trajectory for the companies I buy I believe are incredibly long and profitable.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,Thinking of selling Apple to put it into Index funds. Thoughts? Apple has been trading pretty much flat since I bought it about 6 months ago. I bought with hopes of growth in the future from the potential EVs. I know I havent waited near long enough but 6 months to only make $12 sucks. Thinking of selling this and putting it into SWPPX which is what I normally invest in. Other considerations are VTI/VXUS 50/50. Thoughts? Hold the AAPL or sell?
2021-06-17 20:14:12,stocks,I share your disappointment in the flat performance of Apple’s stock. But I think you should buy more while it’s flat. It’s still a phenomenal company with some avenues to growth.

2021-06-17 21:32:56,stocks,"Historically mega-cap growth stocks like AAPL tend to underperform the market. Part of the issue is market cap. It's going to be very difficult to add even 25% to a 2.2 trillion cap. Retail is certainly incapable of adding $550b so you are basically relying on institutions.

That's not to say that AAPL can't keep growing, but a PE of 30 with a 2 trillion market cap demands very high growth numbers, while at the same time having such a high market cap makes that growth hard to sustain/justify."

uhhh

>but 6 months to only make $12 sucks.

How much money and what was your buy in price, if you think about it, if you bought the dip, you are doing well, if you bought near the top of course its going to look flat.

Why sell though ? Why not just add the next money into index funds ? This is what i don't get the most. Unless we are talking about a million you have, you should still be actively saving up money technically.

I mean you are also the guy that bought Apple that went flat for 6 months, and now you are asking reddit, how can you trust yourself that next step you do also won't go flat for another 6 months ?

Also impatience, don't forget that after you sell, its going to have the historically best run up ever, but its never ever going to go up as long as you are still holding.

This is part of investor psychology and how people always end up buying at peaks and selling before the next run up."
2021-06-17 22:11:27,stocks,AAPL is trading sideways and bumping along IMO. How big can they get? I know some will disagree and yada yada yada I'd put the money in VTI/VXUS 70/30 if it were me.
2021-06-17 22:16:55,stocks,I'd wait a week at least. Apple seems to be on a bit of an upswing lately and just got out of the 120s for the first time in what feels like awhile.

2021-06-18 07:06:48,stocks,Probably not a good idea to sell apple as a good chunk of the performance of the index is from apples share growth along other tech giants. Should just DCA.

2021-06-17 22:56:59,stocks,"Wait - are you saying AAPL has a tendency to underperform compared to the market?!

As r/notlongnot posted already

“YTD on SWPPX, VTI, VXUS are 10-14% plus
5 year on SWPPX, VTI, VXUS are 50-100% plus
YTD on AAPL is 1.85%
5 Year on AAPL is 464%”

I don’t quite understand the thought of “it’s hard to add to a already large market cap”. 

They have virtually unlimited money for R&D. So while you might look at it as “it’s hard to add 500B to a 2T market cap” I look at it as “a company with a 2T market cap and a long history of innovation in technology has an infinite amount of money to continue to make products that will likely become a part of people’s everyday life”

They (using AAPL in this case - but you can use any tech stock you’d like) are constantly making products that are universally loved and consumed at crazy high rates.

Over the last twenty years: iPod. iPhone. iPod Touch. MacBook Pro. iPad. More iterations of iPhones that has users buying a new one every two years. Apple Watch. Bought BEATS by Dre and blew that up. Apple Pay. MacBook Air. AirPods.

And that’s off the top of my head. Look around when you’re out and about - I’m guessing almost every person you see has or uses an Apple product. Most of them you can see out in the open - watch, AirPod, phone.

Obviously I’m long in AAPL - but my reply can really be used by any mega-cap tech stock (insert their cutting edge products instead)."

2021-06-17 22:07:34,stocks,"VTI is a good starting place OP, and so is SPY. If you find the time, and have the interest, you could consider researching other companies to invest in. At a young age, now is the time to take risk. Not stupid risk, but some risk. 

There's plenty of high growth, speculative stocks out there that could yield substantial returns in the coming decades. And they could complement VTI or SPY nicely"

2021-06-18 00:06:54,stocks,That's a great choice. One of the best things you can do long term. Only thing that I might suggest would be to put ~25% of it in VXUS to diversify for international markets. Both are great ETFs with extremely low expense ratios.

Let's say that you will graduate at 23 years old and get a job that you can use to invest 1k$/month.

This would give you 5 years to invest, with a 7% gain rate, this will result in 1752$, so less than what you will be able to save in 2 months after you get a proper job.

Basically you would compromise the enjoyment of your youth years, skipping parties and events with friends for some money that will be basically irrelevant after you get a proper job."

2021-06-18 07:56:38,stocks,"So I plugged some numbers [here](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/investment-calculator) at no starting income and 25 dollars monthly for 40 years.  Your raw dollar amount invested over that time will be 12,000 dollars.  However for a very conservative 6% return over that time, you would be looking at 50 thousand total at the end of that period.   If the 10% which is more historically accurate atm holds you're looking at 158k.  Either way a pretty good return on what will equate to you spending 12,000 dollars over your life time.  

Now this isn't going to be FIRE money but as you get older, you can up those contributions quite easily and get that compound interest working for you.  r/financialindependence and r/personalfinance will also be of help to you in planning longterm."

(7) now im here where my portfolio is 80% VTI and 20% speculative plays and then occasionally i use a small percentage of my margin to sell some options. Every paycheck i buy some vti and then when my vti allocation gets to around 85%, i buy other stocks i like and bring the balance back down. Usually its just palantir, apple, or microsoft"
2021-06-18 10:03:43,stocks,"There is literally nothing smarter than putting a regularly amount in VTI every month, tho $25 is a tiny amount. Try to make sure you raise that amount up over time as your career rises. Another smart thing for any young person is to butter up any rich relative who plans on leaving you money later anyway to ""loan"" (or give) money for you to max out a Roth IRA every year. That's the cloest thing to free money that exists, and if you could somehow max out your $6000 each year, you could grow it over time and never have to pay taxes on it later in life."
2021-06-18 10:20:21,stocks,"I agree with other posters.  If you can schedule automatic partial shares to be bought, bump it down to weekly instead of monthly.  If that means $6.00 a week thats fine.  But this is seriously the best thing you can do.  Eventually when you can afford it bump it up to $8.00, then $10.00 a week etc.  Keep bumping it up to what you can afford and short of the United States failing to be a country anymore, you'll be sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars by you time of retirement."

2021-06-18 11:33:02,stocks,"Better to put 1/2 in VTI and 1/2 in VGT if Vanguard will allow it. If not, put all into VGT. You are young and can afford the greater volatility risk [beta]  in order to reap the higher expected growth [alpha] from greater tech exposure."

2021-06-18 14:17:39,stocks,"Excellent initial strategy.

If you have income from a summer or weekend job or the like, open a Roth IRA and invest/dollar average into that account before investing in a non-retirement account.

You will need $1000 to open a Roth IRA with Vanguard, have your parents front you the $1000 to open the account if necessary.

I also recommend VIG (growth) over VTI given your age and exceedingly long (hopefully) investment horizon.

And, let me give you a speculation, financially, you're going to do well in life with this kind of insight at 17 years of age. Peace and good luck!"

He’s on the right path to retire at 55. Good for him. Only thing I’d recommend for OP, is let’s say that $25/month is 5% of their income. As OPs income increases, maintain that 5% monthly investment. Don’t keep it at $25/month, but keep the same % of their income going into it. Good on ya friend, you’re way ahead of a lot of us here."

2021-06-17 22:33:40,stocks,For free trade account only. You wouldn’t even break even on VTI for years paying a fee every month for a $25 investment.
2021-06-18 00:20:03,stocks,I agree. If 25 a month is what you got go 6 or 7 a week. The higher frequency lets you stay more true to the DCA desired outcomes of buying high sometimes and low other times

2021-06-18 00:28:57,stocks,"S&p has been averaging 7-10% lifetime. Closer to 10% lately, which could imply we are growing faster and the trent will continue, or we are taking some of the growth from the future and putting it in now which would imply the coming years to have lowered returns. 

Im still putting money in every week. But odds are there will be a good pullback or dip relatively soon which could hurt the yearly growth numbers. I would advise to not always ""wait for a dip or correction"" though because if you miss out on the 3 best days of the entire year then you miss out on like 50% of your profits had you held the entire year. Unless you have great timing, and as a beginner you should expect yourself to not have great timing yet."
2021-06-17 21:25:41,stocks,What are the fees? I’m pretty new to stocks and am a little confused on this. Do you still have fees if you buy VTI with apps like Webull/Robinhood?

Edit: I was looking at the chart and realized I said for today when I meant yesterday and the price is off.

However, the Vanguard fees are really low.  0.03% for VTI and 0.08% for VXUS.  These also both provide dividends that when you enable reinvestment will also grow your holdings over time.  You still get dividends even with fractional shares, based on how large your fraction is."

 If I had gone pure VOO, I'd have made a 73% profit, while this bet I was fairly confident in took that to almost 82%. Beating the market by 2% annually adds up to a surprisingly large amount of money over a career.

And yeah, obviously you can't predict what company will double, but the point of investing in individual stocks is that you're trying to pick companies that will outperform the market. My larger point here was that you don't need to get Facebook level gains (about 1200% in the last 9 years) to outperform the market. 15.6% is a great long-term strategy for wealth accumulation, but that isn't to say that a few equities you're highly confident in and that you've done significant DD on can't boost your performance.

2021-06-18 14:04:39,stocks,"So I have a business in the gun world. We've had the longest run on guns/ammo that we've ever seen. Usually the panic subsides in a couple of months and things get back to 'normal'. But the pandemic coupled with the election chaos followed now by the fear that Biden/Democrats are going to grab guns(lol same fear everytime a Dem is elected).

HOWEVER there's been a BIG down-turn in buying recently. Like dropping off a cliff big. Prices on most ammo has dropped 20-40% over a month period. The premium certain firearms commanded like ARs, etc, is mostly done. All ""normal"" guns are staying in stock now, it's only the more rare things that are still hard to keep in stock.

The thing with firearms is that it's not a consumable resource. Once you buy a guy you own that gun for life(or until you sell it on the secondary market). Yes, people will still keep buying guns, but you have to remember that this was a VERY odd year for the firearms industry - and if trends follow previous cycles, we're going to see prices and demand bottom out for years as people realize ""oh shit I spent way too much money on guns/ammo."" I'm sure we'll have more runs on guns/ammo with more world catastrophes and fears of gun control. 

What I'm saying is that all of the market forces driving the sales/revenue/income numbers are played out for the foreseeable couple of years. People have spent all they could afford to spend on guns/ammo and then some. I really expect to see a much slower market in the next couple of years. The secondary market is going to get absolutely flooded with good deals too as people try to unload all of the unnecessary weapons they picked up in a panic. It's what happens every time. That will also really slow the sales of new guns because why buy new when you can get the same thing used for 20%-30% off?

Bottom line S&W will **absolutely not post numbers like this for the next few years barring ACTUAL movement on gun control and not just a bunch of talk or another pandemic-like event.** To give you a sense of the kind of market that created this situation:

* Jan-April 5.56 was selling for as much as $1.50/rd. Up from around 20 cents per round pre pandemic.
* AR-15s worth $500 were selling for $1,000-1500
* Handguns which were selling for 10-20% below MSRP all sold for MSRP or 10-20% higher then MSRP.
* Nothing could stay stocked on the shelves.

We're just not going to see market conditions like that in the short term barring something outrageous. Even the latest ATF releases about ""ghost guns"" and pistol braces barely made a blip in sales. People are just out of cash and they've bought too much shit already. I'm already seeing a steady influx of weapons being posted below MSRP on the secondary market. That hasn't been the case for months now, most things being sold second hand were commanding 10-50% over MSRP just because of the supply squeeze.

But now all the stores shelves are starting to get stocked again and staying stocked. Things that would be gone online within 5 minutes of them being posted are staying in stock indefinitely again. Go look at /r/gunaccessoriesforsale lots of things being listed, not a lot of things being sold.

So here's my question - knowing all of this, is it still a good buy? I am not versed in how to properly evaluate a company. But I am very very involved in the firearms market and am absolutely certain that we're going to have a much much cooled off market for the next couple of years, again barring big events like actual gun control or more pandemic type civil unrest and/or a civil war which sadly is not even a crazy concept anymore."

2021-06-18 03:56:03,stocks,"The run on guns have been going on for the past 18 months. I’ve been keeping a close eye on the firearms industry for the past couple years and have made firearms my pandemic hobby. 2020 was a record year for firearms sales, most amount of firearms sold in one year. The first half of this year, sales are on pace to break last years record. Google: “fbi NICS background check”, the NICS bg check is run for any new gun purchase. 

At the start of the pandemic in the US (March 2020), people started panic purchasing items, one of the hot items was guns. The run on guns was worse than the toilet paper shortage. People were standing in lines for 3+ hours to get into a gun store. Gun stores shelves were literally bare and empty everywhere in the country. If you YouTube “gun sales” you’ll see video proof. 

Gun sales haven’t slowed since March 2020. It was the pandemic panic buying, then all the rioting that happened from George Floyd / antifa / BLM / white supremacy, then fear of a democrat in office campaigning on gun control, election results, Capitol Hill overrun by protestors, Biden “executive action” for gun control. 

Only recently have gun stores had inventory on shelves that sat for more than a day. I frequently visit local gun shops and sporting goods stores and they’ve been cleaned out. Guns and ammo sells out the same day the shipment comes in."

Hypothetically, lets say a company is growing, but I am the only person to buy some stock.  No others get bought/sold.  In my head (with little understanding of how this works), the price does not move because there is no action.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Exxon, Suncor, Devon today. I make posts here about oil relatively frequently at this point. Todays price action on crude is something I expected after the fed meeting. A stronger US dollar does not help oil, but I think for the long run, the oil thesis is still very much in tact and today may be a good opportunity to average up, or buy calls for good companies.

All 3 of my oil holdings are taking big losses today, as well as my options. I took the opportunity to buy more shares of Exxon. I have not bought more suncor or Devon because I believe that I may be able to get them cheaper at some point, and I'm also happy with my overall positions and cb so far. I did also buy farther dated calls for Exxon, and I did them at a higher strike($70 1/22.) I still hold $60-65 7/16 strike calls. 

I think this is oversold and I believe this is worth holding. Most people have been in oil for a while, and I have gotten in relatively late (Feb) I still think this is going to play out well for people long oil. WTI is creeping up mid day. We also had a fantastic day for oil on Tuesday, with prices gapping up significantly. I think this is normal commodity volatility and is NOT worth panicking about. 

These companies are not at precovid highs despite the financial situation they are in. I would suggest waiting for earnings to reassure that the higher oil prices are going to mean fantastic cash flows for Exxon (and others.) The price of crude, even if it stays at current levels, will make the company be able to comfortably afford a dividend hike, which will make the shares more valuable.

I brought up the stronger dollar, and that is what I feel is really hitting the energy sector today. Commodities all around are taking a hit, this is not just oil getting hit. Inflation is very real still as well, and inflation is great for oil. I think the shakeup today is probably people taking profits (understandably so,) and repositioning. 

Commodity volatility should be expected. I have not seen it this squirrelly in a while though, but I expect that even though the graphs may look a bit fishy, this will continue playing out the way oil longs think. Best of luck to you all, stay safe out there, the market is definitely a bit strange these days."
2021-06-18 15:34:34,stocks,"hey, it's stupid but mind sharing with me on how you evaluate oil companies? 

i am holding 3 different ones as well which i bought last year, i did actually do DD on some of them (i panic sold XOM for RDS at one point, not too happy with that one) but did not bother to write it down or really memorize it. now i want to evaluate till when i hold them."
2021-06-18 15:39:29,stocks,"This is a swing trade for me, and I'm mainly following their free cash flows and debt repayment. Oil companies tend to trade on cash flows (dividend safety,) and balance sheet. So improvement in those two areas are mainly what I focus on. Exxon payed down $4b In debt last quarter, and I'm waiting for their earnings to see the situation improve. 

I took yesterday and today to buy more calls. My portfolio does hate me for it though. At this market cycle, market seems to be believing the transitory nature of inflation, I still don't buy 100% of it.

Also OPEC today said the fears that US shale will start to produce is false and that they have market control until 2022ish while US shale still is focusing on cash flows and returning cash to shareholders. The fundamental bull market for oil is still in tact despite this all around correction.

I do not value my swing trades on any technicals, I do not tend to believe in those with commodities like oil."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Trading US securities on Scotia iTrade? Watch out This may be obvious for some people but I did not realize the crucial mistake I was making and in doing so, have lost probably thousands unnecessarily in FX conversion over the past few months.

Every iTrade account comes with a CAD and USD side. You have the ability to buy and hold USD securities through the CAD side. However, when you go to sell the security, you will have to convert it back into CAD.

For example, on June 10th I sold Facebook and had to convert back to CAD since I owned it in the CAD side of my TFSA. I sold the shares for a 1.192 FX rate.

On the same day, I bought another US security with my CAD but paid 1.230 as an FX rate. This is a spread of 3.18%. The trade was around $10,000 CAD so I essentially paid $318 in FX fees + commission for the trade.

The moral of the story is - learn from my expensive mistake and if you plan on trading US securities, do it in the USD side of whatever account you're using. If you currently hold US securities in the CAD side of your account, you can call iTrade and they will ""re-journal"" them to the USD side, or you can do it yourself by submitting a securities transfer e-form under the ""additional services"" tab."

Even if you take the average YoY increase in CPI from 2010-2019, and imply that growth to 2020 to get an “expected” CPI, had there not been a pandemic, 2021 YoY is still significantly above even that.

I don’t care for memestocks, pump and dumps or the usual “overlooked” stocks that everyone is talking about but nobody is buying (for good reason). I’d like to see this as an exchange of ideas, where we all can profit from each other’s insight. So here is one I find interesting: Rosenbauer. They are a small company from Austria, their market cap is less than 0,5 billion  ( about 350 Million Euros give or take), but they are the world largest maker of fire engines. That market is small and competitive, but has very few serious players and is very difficult to enter because there is a lot of engineering in such a truck and there is an insane amount of regulations to deal with ( at least in most countries) Rosenbauer styles itself as the technology leader in the industry. (And looking at how others have copied their designs in recent years, they probably are correct about that. They have recently debuted the worlds first hybrid fire truck, that will most definitely drive sales in the near future, their fundamentals are solid, the stock price has gone up about 40 per percent since January alone, after a more than decent recovery after the COVID-drop.

Even if demand for RVs dried up, they'll still be in an advantageous position.

After googling it seems like a Senior Note is a type of bond. The article isn't clear whether this company has borrowed this bond money and intends to pay it back or if it's the opposite. The language is a little confusing to me. In a quote in the article, ""Superior operating performance and our focus on unlocking value through the sale of non-core assets..."" seems to say that they're selling something, which confuses me even further.

Yesterday, the market got all worried about inflation and tapering, and today (and for the last few days, really) all of those sectors are getting destroyed. And guess what is all in the green? Tech. Even the ARK stocks. The very things that are supposed to sell off with higher inflation and higher interest rates.

There is a significant difference between the two. You may want to determine your goal.

You are listening to headlines and not reading fundamentals and doing your due diligence. If you are trading you should determine what type of trader you are. If you want to invest, think long term.

I don't know what's ironic about what I said, but you seem to use a different meaning to what I'm used to.

You said you can only see the strategy ""buy-low, sell-high"" working on green days, I said: No, because Warren Buffett does precisely that. If you bought it because you believed in it, then buy more when it goes down, you don't sell.

I see no irony."

2021-06-18 00:59:15,stocks,"> The same Burry which sold GME right before January events and spoke against it ?

He bought GME way before the reddit meme and made a lot of profit on it, are you really going to question his ability because he couldn't predict it going to $400? He has an amazing track record, he doesn't have a crystal ball though. He also made half a billion on Tsla puts this year. He predicted the housing bubble of 2009. Ever heard of the big short?

> Why suddenly betting ? Can't you just check it ? What ETF did you buy 13 years ago, how did it perform ? How did the tech perform ?

Do it yourself. Find out what were the 20 most popular tech stocks 13 years ago or something and track their performance against the S&P500 for example.

> And why do we suddenly have to start the ''except FAANG'' ? They would be part of the equation after all. I have not seen anyone who would buy a tech and somehow forget to buy FAANG. 

Because like I said before, not every tech stock is massively overvalued. I just said that most of them are."

2021-06-18 12:30:44,stocks,"Your problem is that you're chasing the segment. I buy companies, I don't buy TECH, CYCLICAL, STAPLES, ENERGY, etc.

If you wanna invest like that, buy ETFs. Again, if you liked *The Company* enough to buy it, you should buy more on the dips, when they're caused by external factors (inflation, pandemics, etc).

There's no need for hindsight when you buy a good company."
2021-06-18 17:20:59,stocks,"My point is that history has shown that buying the dip doesn't always work, even if it's a good company. A lot of the times you'll try to catch a falling knife that way. Look at the dotcom bubble, very extreme example, but even the greatest tech companies didn't reach a new high until around 10 years in. Companies like Cisco have never reached a new high. 99% of tech companies from that period went bankrupt most likely.

If you diversify the majority of your portfolio over value stocks and ETF's and have a smaller part in tech stocks/etf's you'll make much more steady and safer gains. It's a solid strategy. People in this thread are acting like OP is an idiot for rotating to value stocks while that isn't a bad idea IMO, even if you lose some short term gains."
2021-06-18 17:44:06,stocks,"what history? history has shown that the market tends to go up on the long run:

https://globalfinancialdata.com/200-years-of-the-united-states-stock-market-in-one-graph

If you want to time the market be my guest, I don't mind you contributing to my retirement fund. Nobody is saying OP is an idiot for rotating. What I heard most of the comments say was that you can't be chasing something else as soon as you see the tide turn. As I said, if you believed in the company when you bought it, and the intrinsic reasons that made you buy it are still there, then there's no reason to rotate. Nobody is saying you can't rebalance or diversify either, but that's also something you need to do with caution.

I made €2K on Monday, I lost €1.5K on Tuesday, I made €2.5K on Wednesday, I made almost €3K on Thursday, I lost €3K today Friday. I made NO transactions this week. If I rotate to booming sectors every time my profit goes down, I'd be selling LOW and buying HIGH almost every other day. It's not sustainable."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Shorting the Banks Title above says it all, just hoping to get some insight  and discuss the possible reasons why this might or might not be a good play. 

Very new to this, started back in June of last year, trying to break outside of ""meme"" stocks, I don't think anything is wrong with them, just looking for different plays.

I'm sure many of you have noticed (or maybe you haven't) that almost all banks residing/operating within the U.S. have been taking some heavy hits these past 6 months from a chart standpoint. Sure from a yearly standpoint they're absolutely killing it, most US banks are up $5, $12, even $20 and most Q1's of this year for most US banks were some of the best quarterlys they've posted in decades, but from my point of view this all seems to be tapering off and this excess success seen in the past year seems to be (and maybe obviously) driven by the pandemic and the abnormal year we had during 2020.

From a 3 month perspective a lot of these gains are still positive but they're like a 1/3rd of what the yearly gains were and for some banks (mostly smaller ones like: First-midwest, Citigroup, Fifth Third Bank] the positive gains and momentum they were having have started turning negative by like $2, $3, $5+ in some cases and others are just breaking even by the cent and to me it seems like the small banks are bleeding out a little faster than the bigger guys, but I suspect the big banks to follow suit due to a lot of monthly and now weekly gains for almost all banks are turning negative as well by again $2, $3+. 

I've personally been following U.S. Bank (USB) the most because I personally Bank with these guys and have been seeing some odd discrepancies on an internal side that don't necessarily match with what they're saying on a public/more formal side. I reside in Iowa and U.S. Bank has been closing down a lot of their branches over here and I've received emails from U.S. Bank stating that the company is going through various changes and restructuring at the moment and that they'd like to have a financial meeting with me to discuss the nature of these changes to assure me that U.S. Bank still has a bright future. U.S. Bank will probably post a good Q2 this July, its going to be higher than their Q2 last year but it's going to be much lower than their Q1 of this year, analysts estimate Q2 of this year to be around .45 cents whilst Q1 of this year was upwards of a $1, I just personally feel like Q3 of this year will be lower than Q2, am I wrong in my thinking/line of logic and understanding here?

All I wanna know is this; is it a good time to start shorting Banks, does the evidence and mania in the market and possible bubble speculation warrant a closer look into shorting these guys? Am I just crazy? 

I'll take any advice or criticism given, just be gentle please"

I would also do some research into current taxes and what those might look like next year and for the next few."
2021-06-18 03:15:48,stocks,"No, don't realize the gains for no particular reason. 

I would need to know the exact positions but if there is a chance at dividends in the future, you definitely don't want to sell. You can profit off dividends on unrealized share gains.

Ideally, the company stays fundamentally strong and you literally never sell."

A useful hint:

A single person can take $40k in long term capital gains every year tax free! Married can do about $80k tax free! If you have a lot of money in there and near retirement, might be good to take a few years off to enjoy the tax free capital gains ;-p"

2021-06-18 01:15:12,stocks,"Then is O a good choice as an inflation hedge? Can any REITs be considered a similar investment to actual property in the current market?

Thank you for the detailed reply btw"
2021-06-18 02:08:48,stocks,"If you want to play it just as an inflation hedge you probably need to leave out the capital gains aspect because that one is hard to predict. If you sell in a bear market, it might be negative or if you sell in a bull market it might be positive. Its still a stock after all so volatility is in play.

But if you look at it just as a income generator and you reinvest said income for compounding returns, then maybe.

If you are talking simple CPI then I would say yes. There were very few times in history where inflation was more than 4%. But its important to note that to keep up you have to reinvest constantly and not just cash out and use it for mojitos and babes... else you fall behind. This is fine if you are a retiree since your intent is to spend the money, not build wealth. 

But if you are talking investment inflation then the answer is no. Investment indices have far outperformed 4% thus you are actually losing buying power over time if your intent is to dump the money into investments. For example, Real Estate has inflated about 7.5% the last 10 years. So after 10 years, you would have lost buying power. 

Of course, there is no guarantee that investments will keep inflated like they have been so its possible that it may keep up with that as well if we enter a bear market or a long sideways market (a la Japanese lost decade/s)."

2021-06-18 12:00:15,stocks,Yeah I was trying to buy several stocks from companies I'd bought from immediately numerous times before. And transferring from the same bank.

I'm invested TCEHY but it's a smaller position. I really love their moat and market segment. I also think they are making killer acquisitions in the gaming space. In my opinion, all the best game companies are private equity, tencent gives exposure to that. It blows my fucking mind that ATVI isn't also on an a acquisition frenzy like tencent. It's shocking how little Tencent is paying for these companies, and it's shocking that the owners are agreeing to the deals. 

That's said, I never allow myself to be more than 10% china (simply for diversification). And right now, I can't justify putting money into TCEHY over baba. Baba’s multiples are so insanely low right now

I think the fears about China on the regulatory side are vastly vastly overstated. The China problem is a macro economic problem more than a regulatory one."

I don't invest in a country where it's legal to fraud foreign investors. Madoff went to jail. Chinese Madoff doesn't go to jail as long as he works with foreign investors. It's not about the company or DD. It's about Chinese law and the risk as a foreign investor.

What Enron did (I guess) was illigal. Madoff is in jail. It wouldn't be in China as long as no Chinese investors are hurt."

2021-06-17 23:50:42,stocks,"We truly are lost when we can no longer tell the difference between the ethno-nationalist totalitarian state that is China today and our own imperfect democracies. If you think the problems the US or my country Australia have today are even slightly comparable to China’s system you are misinformed, that’s not to say we are perfect and there are no problems. Tencent, like all private enterprises in China, is ultimately state owned. Investing in it is investing in the Chinese state, you know the same one force sterilizing people and working them as slaves. If this makes me xenophobic so be it, I’ve been to China and I like the Chinese people which is precisely why it’s such a shame their government and the structure of their state is horrific."
2021-06-18 03:28:04,stocks,"I just don't see how Tencent accepting business from the CCP makes them culpable for genocide or human rights abuses. The Australian government and people do a lot of business with China for example, something like 40% of our exports are based on trade with China.

No one is disputing that the CCP is conducting genocide and should not be supported. You seem to keep glossing over the fact that this argument seems hyperbolic when we are discussing a videogame publisher that is so large one of its many clients is the CCP.

Speaking of Australia, here is some good policy regarding cleaning up investment around supporting CCP genocide and human rights abuses. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-18/bipartisan-call-for-ban-on-goods-from-xinjiang/100224952. 

I do not see similar efforts from the US, likely as the US maintains the largest privatised prison in the world and imprisons more of its citizens then any country on earth, 40% of whom are African American. You can be sure the US does not want to clean up supply chains of prison labour implicated production. 

But I'm sure you might still buy shares in companies that have the US government as a client? Microsoft for example has been taking on more and more defense contracts for AR products. We can all agree that supporting human rights abuses are unacceptable so if the moral line is support no company who receives business from a compromised government then that standard should apply across the board no?"
2021-06-18 07:00:51,stocks,"I appreciate you having a thought out objection, I still disagree on many points but I feel if we are to continue this debate it should probably be elsewhere than an r/stocks comment section. My closing thoughts, Tencent doesn’t just do business with the CCP they are owned by the CCP, as all major businesses in China are. It’s profits in large part will go to the CCP not to private citizens. On your point about the fact that our countries do so much business with China already, you are of course correct, and it should be phased out as quickly as possible. Whatever problems the US system has at least there can be open opposition, protest and change. That is not possible in China, the conversation we are having would not be possible in China. I mean the words could be said but there is no guarantee it would not result in punishment. Besides my points were about China, how it operates and how in my opinion it increasingly appears to be evolving into system not unlike Nazi Germany. Refute those points rather than deflecting to “Well the US is just as bad” no it isn’t and besides that doesn’t address my points."

2021-06-18 07:51:18,stocks,"The guys on the board are typically tied to the majority of the stock. So its almost always their call and many times they get to vote even though its not their money (fund managers etc), so as you might guess, there is a lot of corruption, capitulation and collusion that can potentially happen (and has, many many times in the past). 

They are also tied to the execs and the two do often collude and do very shady things. Not saying thats the case here, but just that it happens. And yea, I have exited plenty of stocks due to shady management. 

Recently, I left RIDE early on when the CEO starting to come of as scummy. I also left GOEV when the bean counters and board hijacked the company away from the CEO and smeared him (he just took a job at MSFT). In the past I avoided several mREITs tied to a specific CEO (Jeffery Zimmer & his pal Scott Alma) who had a history of making new companies and bankrupting them after siphoning money. I have also pulled many background checks on execs and board members of small and micro cap company I intended to invest into. Its cheap and worth it."

Are you the head of NYSE? Cause he didn’t *say* dark pools are used to *intentionally manipulate prices* in the quote. *You* keep saying it.

But then again, your perspective is pretty simple:

Funds (supposedly) act to influence stock prices: evil selfish unfair manipulation!

Retail acts to influence stock prices: that’s the point of trading, buy and make price increase and then sell!

The hypocrisy is thick. The meme crowd brought huge price distortions on some stocks, is often acting with the adamant purpose of blowing up someone else position (Short Squeeze!), sees the stock market as a Get Rich Quick scheme, yet complains that others manipulate the market.
Pot. Kettle.

And the biggest irony?
**You want hedge funds to short stocks**, all the while you rally against them, because it gives you both a villain to feel holier yourself, and a counterpart for your Get Rich Quick short squeeze scheme to work.

The last thing you want is to happen is that there is no manipulation, that AMC etc are owned 100% by retail and no one is shorting them, and that there is no villain to exploit for your own holiness and profit."

They don't want to trade until they see a good price. Same as you. Their shares are not for sale until the quotes move their way. Same as yours. You would absolutely lose your shit if the law was that you had to leave your shares in the window for everyone to pick at all the time. The rules for those who seek to qualify and are given permits to be MMs are that they have to do that, but only 3000+ or 5000+ shares at a time.

If you want the whales to trade, make them an offer. Put in a limit order and they will see it.

Market rules apply to those who trade on the market. They have no reason to apply to anyone who trades elsewhere. SEC rules, however, apply to everyone who trades securities anywhere.

Very few tickers have millions of people willing to trade them. The vast majority are barely ticking at all on most days. If every lot had to go through the book, the market would be as stable as a dribbled basketball."

If Citadel is creating disequilibrium then it would create a massive arbitrage opportunity for the others. There would be a lot more competition and Citadel would be one of several similarly sized providers, not 25-50% of the market.

The reason is they're not creating disequilibrium. They're reducing retail cost and winning orders because the others can't operate as efficiently or won't allow margins to be as low.

There might be an argument to split the MM unit into several companies to reduce concentration, but eventually they'd be acquired or competed out of business by each other. The only way around that would be to hand all market-making to a government agency.

The accusations that the MM and hedge operations are in collusion isn't backed by any evidence. They had FINRA, the SEC, and Congress all up in their shit a few months ago and all that came of it was grandstanding about how Big Money was exploiting the System to hurt The Little Guy.

Your linked article doesn’t talk of price “manipulation”, definitely not in the sense that you imply.

The concern it mentions is a wider spread on the Buy-Ask offers because of the smaller trading pool. Keep in mind, these spreads are tiny. You may be losing 1 cent on every share you trade, or a fraction of that, or a little more of the situation is really egregious.

But it has nothing to do with your claim that “they” “sell on the open market but buy in the dark pools” to lower a stock price, neither in function or in magnitude of the effect.

They don't make money when you buy. They make money when you buy high and sell low because that's how the book has always worked.

2021-06-18 19:44:31,stocks,"So the backstory with Consol is this, (which I didn't mention because the post was already kind of long...)  I grew up in West Virginia.  I had a grandfather who was a long wall miner (that's shop talk for an underground mine...  as opposed to a strip mine...  We have both in WV)  He died of black lung at 58.  In my teens I knew the difference between anthracitic, bituminous, and lignite coal.  I knew that Consol mined in WV with its deposits of anthracitic coal (the highest grade, its high carbon, no moisture, low sulphur)  WV has some of the highest grade coal in the world.  This is important because it's not cheap ""power plant grade coal""  (bituminous).  It's was in high demand for making steel, not firing power plants.  It commanded a higher price.  China was still in it's city and infrastructure phase and was importing a lot of WV coal.  The US steel industry demand is always there, but with China's unprecedented need, demand and price was high for Consol's product and they were a major player in an area that will basically never run out of that type of coal.  So yes.. perhaps little DD on the company, but I did know the sector (in hindsite...  I didn't know what a ""sector"" was at the time)  lol  The dividend is what sold it.  I really thought the stock would pay for itself eventually and then I'd look into selling it.  Value did go up faster than I anticipated, but again, knowing the sector, I knew where price would eventually be heading, so I took profits.  


With China's ""city building"" phase over, it's very likely that the world may never see that kind of demand for steel (and the coal it takes to make it) again.  As a side note, I always chuckle when Trump or some other vote panderer promises to ""bring back coal"" in WV.  They have no idea what they're talking about.  Anthracite coal had a ""rebirth"" from 1990-2008 because of China.  That kind of demand is not coming back anytime soon.  (Although I think if we get our shit together on this US infrastructure bill, we may see a bit of a renaissance in the sector...  Something to think about...)

Where I really think I got ""lucky"" was not being invested in the market when it crashed in 08.  Any profit made off that sale could have been wiped out if I had immediately reinvested it when I sold in 07.  I don't know that I would have had the discipline back then not to panic sell and cement those losses rather than ride it out.

I agree 100% though, for most investors index/ETFs are the way to go.  You have to keep in mind that I was just illustrating what can be done with $1800 of side money and a few things I learned from it."

Um...prioritize getting cash flow (a job) and pull every bit out. See what repmt plan options you could roll into for the loan if available.

You need to know about debt, competitors, direction of demand, insider trading trends, earnings per share, overall investor sentiment...  There is a lot to consider.

You should have a reasonable understanding of the underlying business. Then, when Cramer starts shouting about “rotating into x because of y factors in the economy” you can think: “okay so there’s going to be high inflation/interest rates/etc is this going to affect this business and in what way? Is this going to affect the long term potential of this business or only short term” etc etc. If you feel like you can’t win with stocks because you buy and sell them every few months because of all the headlines then just put your money into a mutual fund/index fund and leave it be and enjoy your free time rather than stressing over whether or not the fed raising interest rates by .5% is going to make your Google stock drop by 1% in a day."

Am I understanding that right?"
2021-06-17 20:12:22,stocks,"The glorious thing about put credit spreads is you actually get a credit when you put the trade on. A put credit spread is bullish, you sell a put at a higher strike price and buy one at a lower, for example 15/10. The credit you receive is the credit from the higher strike sold, minus the lower strike put you buy. This credit is your max profit. 

Downside loss is low strike x100 minus high strike price x100 plus the credit you received so in the example above it would be (10x100) - (15x100) + whatever you're credit was. That is the max amount you can ever lose on the credit spread. To receive max profit you want the price to be above 15 when the option expires, anywhere in between 10-15 you will win/lose some depending on price. 

So to put on a put credit spread, you basically just need enough funds to cover the max loss, since if the price was below 10, you would exercise your bought put and sell at market, then sell the 100 shares at the 15 to the person who bought the put you sold."

2021-06-18 17:16:46,stocks,"It all depends on what the value of the options you're trading are. 

You buy a put/sell a put in the same transaction, the sold put is  the higher strike price, therefore you end up with a credit. The higher the credit you receive, generally the less loss involved, but also has to do with underlying asset price. 

I've seen as long as like $30-$40 max loss on them.

>>Who is we? Europe didn't. Neither did the US. The Dow closed October 9, 2007 at 14,164.53. It closed March 5, 2013 at 14,253.77. You tell me what record high it hit in 2008 though 2012. What date?
>
>Why are you referencing the DOW if you're talking about Europe lol.

Because I said Europe recovered from 2008 last week, and the Dow was flat from 2007 to 2013. *You* said ""we recovered by March 2012."" This is factually incorrect for both indexes. Then I asked you to name the date and price, and you didn't. Because there isn't one. 

>Also, the dow dipped in late 2007 but rallied up again in 2008, only to then drop significantly. I fact, in April 2008 it was the same value as April 2007, the wobble in late 2007 to early 2008 looked like previous and comparable market fluctuation.  

So you now admit that it was indeed flat from 2007 to 2013. Good. I accept your retraction.

>Worst for 90 years. That's exactly why I said lifetime. Recessions do happen but there need to be so many factors that come in play, large, deep global recessions are once every few generations. Please pay more attention becuase I'm not interested in tangential arguments from you not reading what I specifically posted. 

Back atcha. Pay attention or STFU.

>Oh, glad you admit that those years of 200 to 2006 are now the boom years, despite previously saying they weren't, and listing them as a period of recession 

I didn't say they were a recession, I said the Dow was flat across 2000 to 2006. Glad you could catch up. Pay attention. Read better. What the fuck. 

>because ""the dow was flat"" (even though it actually wasn't during that period and gained by 50% (from around 1000 to 1500)).

January 14, 2000, the Dow was 11,722.  
October 3, 2006, it was 11,727.34. Tell me how that's 50% higher. 


>>This isn't r/comprehensiveindicatoroftheeconomy
>
>Well that's for sure, becuase you're the one using the dow as if it is. It's one indicator, like the S&P is, like the 10 year treasury note is etc. Why you're clinging on to the dow, I don't know but it shows a lack of broad understanding about economics. 

This takes an extra level of bad reading skills. Seriously. I tell you the Dow was flat, you say that's not a measure of the economy, I tell you we're not talking about a measure if the economy we're talking about stocks in r/stocks, and you accuse me of taking about measures of the economy?? What the fuck? Read better. 

>>No I don't.
>
>You do, becuase otherwise you'd understand that you could have invested at any point in the last 40 years, including the peaks and you would have had guaranteed returns. That is literally the meaning of a safe investment.

Go ahead and invest during any of those years I mentioned and you end up worse than holding cash. But sure, miss the entire fucking point of the post, why don't you?

Do you have an idea how the stock market works? It discounts future expectations. Your beloved SPG REIT deals with shopping malls and outlet centers. Do you see ANY issue with that? For example the fact that COVID accelerated a trend that was already present before - the death of the American mall. I would rather prefer to invest in a great stock at its historical peak valuation than a crappy stock at a ""discounted"" valuation. And if you care about profits as you say, you should too. In 5 or 10 years from now I strongly doubt that SPG will have beaten the S&P 500 since it operates in a dying industry.

By the way, literally ANY idiot has made money off investing in the past 5/10 years. Whether it's RE or stocks, assets are incredibly inflated right now. I literally made 43% in a portfolio that is 75% ETFs in 2020. Do I consider myself a genius? Far from it.

2021-06-18 05:24:52,stocks,"For me to feel like I can talk about a particular stock, I need to look into competitors (market stalwarts) and I want to feel like I understand the industry.  You've thrown out mostly individual stocks in different industries, so the time to look at all of them would be immense for me.

I've looked at BUD and TAP, and compared them to KO (coke), PEP (pepsi) and Constellation brands (STZ) as they all fill a similar market place.

I try to buy stocks that I can hold for a long time and I'm not trying to find short term trades (though I will do them on occasion if a stock that I hold becomes overvalued in my opinion).  Because of this approach, I focus on current earnings, future earnings, profit margins and projected growth.  If a company has small margins, then I like for them to have a good quick ratio (short term assets vs short term liabilities).

Of these stocks, TAP has the lowest price/future earnings - but it also has the lowest growth prospects.  Both BUD and TAP have negative earnings and not great quick ratios.  

Ko, pep, and stz have PE ratios about 24, with a 5 year average PE ratio of about 22.  They're all positive in earnings and pay a small dividend, and all 3 project to grow ~9% per year (Bud and tap are about 3% projected growth per year).

Because of these weaknesses, I would rate both Bud and Tap below the other 3 stocks AT THE CURRENT PRICES.  I would need to look deeper into Bud and Tap to make sure I was happy with their plan to regain profitability - and if I was happy with that then I'd be having a very close look at them if they lost 18-20% of their current value.  It does sound like a long way off, but that's what a watchlist is for.

KO, Pep and STZ - again I'd look more at their business plan, but I'd be looking more closely at them if they pulled back 10-12%."
2021-06-18 10:55:15,stocks,"BUD does not have negative earnings. How did you come up with that assessment?

KO and PEP aren’t really in the same market as BUD or TAP. Sure they sell beverages, but not beer. I anticipate a good summer for sales in beer, simply from a common sense line of reasoning. People have been drinking all along, sure. But big gatherings, parties, and celebrations have been curtailed. It’s time to party again, especially with warm weather and blue skies.  In fact I don’t just predict a good summer, but a great one. Better than 2019. When fall comes, well, that’s when I look forward again. I won’t guess now.

I will look for a few other beer companies. I picked BUD to because they are the biggest. But maybe there are small choices that are making big gains in market share.

My current base strategy is to look forward to the next quarter or two and backwards at least just beyond March 2020. I won’t waste my time trying to look any further forward than six months and certainly won’t set useless 12 month price targets, unlike every analyst out there. I figure that I have never worked for a company that can accurately predict even a year into the future, why should I expect to do any better spending less time and with less training that the management of those companies? However, I will repeatedly reassess everything that I own or watch regularly. Once a month is likely to be the longest interval between those assessments. While I hope to hold for a good long time, I won’t hesitate to sell for short term gains and possibly buy back in later. Right at the moment I am unconcerned about taxes as I have no real income. I was laid off in 2019 and decided to retire. I start social security this year, late enough that my annual income will be quite low for the year."

Hello, I am still kind of new to investing so my portfolio might need to be changed a bit and I am looking for advice on what to change within my portfolio.Some current information that might help

&#x200B;

**Time Horizon:** Very long 40+ years (Currently 16)

**Risk Tolerance:** Medium

**Preferred Investing Style:** Growth (Preferably Blue chip)

**Amount of Capital Invested:** \~$3350 (Currently adding $50 a week)

**Time Invested In This Portfolio:** 7 months

**Current Broker:** M1 Finance

**Portfolio:**

VOO - 20.19%

VTI - 20.00%A

APL - 14.33%

MSFT - 12.56%

AMZN - 11.56%

AMD - 3.52%

TSM - 3.33%

PYPL - 3.01%

CRM - 2.93%

V - 2.56%

NVDA - 2.24%

ADBE - 1.91%

MA - 1.86%

**Questions I have:**

I know VOO and VTI are basically identical; they just have different allocations of each stock. So is it ok to have both of them in my portfolio, or should I go \~40% into one of the two to clean my portfolio a little?

How often should I re-balance my portfolio, so I get in the habit of not creating too many taxable events?

I am very bullish on cloud computing and semiconductors long term but I feel I may be too heavily invested in those sectors. Should I decrease my allocation to these sectors in my portfolio and diversify more, or is it ok to make bets like this because of my time horizon?

Is it ok to have basically my entire portfolio in large-cap tech stocks? Have I diversified enough with the 40% allocation of the two funds (VOO and VTI)?"

2021-06-18 10:40:23,stocks,This man has outperformed this whole sub and most professional equity managers.
2021-06-18 01:31:18,stocks,What’s the exact ticker
2021-06-18 17:02:17,stocks,Not a criticism but why Estée Lauder
2021-06-18 19:42:28,stocks,"VOO and VTI are quite similar except VTI include small cap and mid Cap companies. You didn't really have to split between VOO and VTI since these ETFs are quite similar. It's ok to have both of them in your portfolio. (Not necessary)

 Since you're young 100% allocation in stock is fine. You're a bit over-exposed to large tech stock, but I mean, it's fine. You have a long time horizon and your portfolio should perform well in the long run. When you'll grow older  you should diversify into other industries idealy."
2021-06-17 21:52:29,stocks,"I hear a lot of people say QQQ isn't as good of an investment over time as it may seem, but I also watched a video of someone taking the return rate of spy and QQQ over the part few years and it was roughly 2.5-2.7X"
2021-06-18 17:01:13,stocks,It think you are holding too many stocks for just 750$
2021-06-18 05:22:00,stocks,"BABA and CRSR are good trades. The rest is too high risk, low reward. CRSR is a short term stock play. They are not generating income but are fully flushed with cash flow."
2021-06-18 14:41:31,stocks,Why LTC?
2021-06-18 11:25:39,stocks,"There is zero reason to have 50+ companies in a portfolio. 

I would also be weary of clov"
2021-06-18 01:40:18,stocks,why do you have so much CLOV? Isn't iti just a meme stock?
2021-06-18 17:44:13,stocks,cuz I like the stock
2021-06-17 22:06:01,stocks,"yeah there are plenty of websites out there to compare ETF performance. I would agree QQQ is riskier, pretty much the golden rule of trading. Riskier the bet, higher the gains. It all has to fit your risk profile and circumstances.

2021-06-18 17:30:34,stocks,What do you suggest I do then...like how many should I have w just $750. Or should I just invest in dividend stocks and/or ETFs
2021-06-18 11:52:05,stocks,What is the concern if you have more than 50 companies? What is the worry about clov?
2021-06-18 01:47:58,stocks,It is not a meme stock. Unfortunately it is tagged as meme stock. The company is in the health care industry and is making in roads in several states and making partnerships with other health related companies. It has 670 million dollars revenue. It is not profitable yet but with the eventual growth this has very good potential in stock appreciation.
2021-06-18 07:18:09,stocks,"I said as good as it seems... it's 3x leveraged to spy, but its not always 3X the return rate of SPY. Sometimes it roughly is tho"
2021-06-18 14:41:14,stocks,"There’s no chance you can keep track of 50 companies. Even if you did, it’s a waste of your time. Have some conviction in your picks and consolidate in what you really believe in. 

As for Clov, it’s blatantly overvalued and grouped in with the other memestocks. Not a believer, but that doesn’t mean I’m right."
2021-06-18 02:02:11,stocks,Nice! And what's your case for AMWL? I bought at $20 and sold at $13 at a huge loss.
2021-06-18 12:10:44,stocks,That's not what QQQ is.
2021-06-18 15:17:23,stocks,I have started with 5 stocks and ended up with this in the name of diversification and trying to find the next multi bagger. I have reached a point of too many and so cutting back the under performers and adding it to the winners.
2021-06-18 02:12:50,stocks,I have a very small position in that. Telehealth is dominated by tdoc and is still in the early stages. For now I am just monitoring the stock and will give little bit more time and might go on chopping block. Good catch.
2021-06-17 23:55:20,stocks,Reed some books by Warren buffet. Jack boggle. Peter lynch. Maybe you will change your mind on dividends. 5% dividend is a warning sign though.
2021-06-18 15:22:01,stocks,"If you want diversification, just own a market etf or buy a sector etf if you think an industry has been beaten down unnecessarily. 

Your quest to find a multi-bagger will also be severely diminished if you only allocate a small percentage of your portfolio towards it. 

Do you have a price target on your securities? If so, how did you arrive at that conclusion? If you’re not well-founded in either of your answers, you shouldn’t be in that stock in the first place."

2021-06-18 15:38:28,stocks,"Yes there was a time where I was in ETFs UDOW, QLD and got out at 3-4x. I have started NVDA at 10. Apple at 15(post split). It became monotonous with big run up and fear of lack of diversification. So far I am doing ok with my strategy,"
2021-06-18 10:30:04,stocks,It all depends on the company you buy. You are confusing new investors. You wouldn’t buy Apple in 2015 because of a divined? Then compounding annual growth with dividends buying more shares? It also depends on taxes. $O realty income pays large dividend and has annual growth of 15% since entering the market. But it’s gets taxed as ordinary income because it’s a reit so it would have been smarter to keep in tax advantage accounts. It’s how you use that dividend to help with growth. But I understand growth is important first. Even warren had a annual growth greats that 35% in his portfolio the first ten years of investing. Then switched to the value investing.
2021-06-18 10:35:48,stocks,"You're missing the point,  focusing solely on dividends is a bad idea because, as you said, you will miss out on the stocks that currently do not pay or pay low dividends. I'm not saying dividends are bad at all and they are an important factor in total returns and compound investing."
2021-06-18 11:35:03,stocks,You replied “ dividends are irrelevant” to someone who recommended adding “some” dividend producing companies to their portfolio. What if the person reading your advice to your response too literally. Understand the context and understand everyone’s investing strategies are different. Some have higher risk tolerance than others.
2021-06-18 11:35:37,stocks,Good luck though homie let’s get that bread and retire on the beach!
