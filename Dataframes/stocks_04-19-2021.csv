Second part is absolutely necessary as well. You need to rebalance. Basically means sell the winners buy the losers so you are back at what you started.

2021-04-19 19:45:16,stocks,"Most of my 401k is in bonds. What I did during the crash last year was move about half of it out of bonds into stock funds when I thought the market was at the bottom. Once it kind of plateaued, I put it back.

Another large portion of my investment money is in real estate. Investment properties. This is (should be) a relatively stable income towards retirement.  Appraisal district here just went around and raised the tax value of most of the property around here 10+ percent, but I still think this is a good long-term investment (just means I'll need the raise the rent to pass on the expense).

Then I have some play money, I've got some money invested in mutual funds, and I've got some money invested in the stock market.

So what do I do if the market crashes, move my 401k back out of bonds into stock funds, scrape together any liquid cash that I can and buy more stocks, and just keep on doing what I'm doing...stay diversified."

In terms of buying equities to prepare, wouldn't that kind of do the exact opposite of helping to weather the storm, given that equities usually are the first to go poof? Given that the framing of the question is what people should do if they thought that such a crisis was coming within a year or two, not if they knew that they were right in the middle of it (Which, like with any market timing, is inherently difficult to do). So would your answer be to keep assets liquid (ie cash on the bank) and buy into equities once you think that they have lost ""enough"" value? (Although, again, that would be playing on luck a bit. When the markets tanked because of corona in mid 2020 I thought ""ohh I should buy into the S&P as soon as it drops more"", but then it never dropped more, haha.)"

Yeah, I agree. A significant financial shock, even if to a lesser extent than '08, could still be on the horizon though.

> which violates this whole thread

How so? I specifically didn't specify equities alone in my post. (Or did you mean in terms of the rules of this sub, since it's aptly named r/stocks?)

I‚Äôm not a believer in trying to be super cute and timing the market which is what you proposed in effect. You‚Äôre right - sometimes it doesn‚Äôt keep going down.

2021-04-19 19:00:21,stocks,"
You‚Äôre right that strategy is also what I do during normal times. Only difference is the mix changes where I set a band like +/- 15% on each bucket. It really shows that we as non-professionals should stick to something that is simple enough to repeat and we can withstand downturns. 

I‚Äôm also making blind assumptions like people here are young and have a long time horizon. Even during downturns, you don‚Äôt have to go completely non-equity. Again...well what if I‚Äôm wrong about the timing? Now I‚Äôm fully invested in bonds...or worse commodities which has its own set of fundamentals.

I‚Äôm not 100% sure how I will play it long term regarding the mining/metal stocks, but I think they have a lot more growth potential (medium/long term) then what people tend to think. Gold will never die, atleast not in the kind of societies we all live in today.

I want things with as little speculative value as possible, such as: Gold, Silver, Oil, Aggriculture, Lumber and so on. Because they have a ‚Äùfixed‚Äù value as people need them to live, NOONE needs a Bitcoin (atleast not for now and probably never)."

2021-04-19 18:01:03,stocks,"Interesting take. You mentioned them having little speculative value, but didn't lumber and oil especially turn out to be extremely volatile during this past year? I admit I don't follow either market quite closely, but I remember coming across my fair share of articles about it. But on a medium timescale, even gold was relatively volatile (~2000$/oz@2012, ~1000$/oz@2016, ~2000$/oz@2020 again).

Regarding the mining stocks, are you mainly using them as a value-store? I mean, you said so already, but you also mentioned growth potential, which is what I'm confused about. While I'm no expert on the subject, in my view mining companies (and similar) should be companies that are extremely easy to value, even for the long term, so wouldn't such growth potential be already priced in?

What do you make of the long-term speculation of many of the mentioned commodities becoming more and more redundant?"

2021-04-19 17:56:08,stocks,buying dividends for the sake of buying dividends is a trap. how a company that is doing well increases value isnt significant- be it dividends or stock value growth.
2021-04-19 18:02:48,stocks,Dividends are more of a nice bonus than a main factor. Read up on why that is.
2021-04-19 17:52:12,stocks,"Do you have a minimum percentage for the dividend or frequency of dividends?  MSFT is super reliable in both growth and dividends.

Also, what's your goal for dividends right now?  $50/week isn't much.  I think you'd be better off reinvesting your dividends until you really find you need the money."
2021-04-19 18:00:37,stocks,"i am also watching for dividend aristocrats like Abbvie and IBM, with high dividend yield"
2021-04-19 18:06:03,stocks,For $50 that‚Äôs $2600 a year. For mmm( I use as example bc I have) that‚Äôs 38k for 1000$ a year. In my experience most stocks will be around 40k for $1000 a year in dividend. Moral of story your gonna be hard pressed to get $50 a week in income for under/@ 50k. Can be done using calls I suppose but you‚Äôll still have a hard time
2021-04-19 19:01:46,stocks,Congrats on doing well so far. Why not go for growth stocks if you are just beginning? AAPL and MSFT will continue to dominate long term. They are not considered big dividend stocks but they do offer dividends too if you want them. But the real value will be in higher stock prices. Just keep adding to them regularly.
2021-04-19 17:31:31,stocks,Looking to get diverse perspectives.  Folks over there are overly concerned with dividends from my experience.
2021-04-19 18:08:44,stocks,"I understand the sentiment, but that is not accurate. The difference is that the dividend is realized vs the growth being unrealized. That is a significant difference depending on your purposes. 

When people say you can only lose if you sell, well that goes the other way too.  Doesn‚Äôt matter what the high was on that meme stock, if you diamond handed it all the way back down. 
Dividends lock in a portion of your profits, that you can reinvest as you see fit or take and use in your life. 

Not claiming one is better than the other, it really depends on your specific circumstances. One implication for example is no tax on the unrealized gains vs tax on dividends.  If you are trading in your Roth this may not matter to you. 

Many more examples out there from smarter people, just wanted to point out there are differences and they can be a big factor."
2021-04-19 19:21:03,stocks,"Not necessarily, a stock value growth is only good for me the day I sell. If my stock shoots up 1000% I've not made a cent, it's all imaginary until I cash out. If the market crashes or the stock goes down for any reason my gains are potentially lost forever.



Now a dividend is the opposite. It's as close as we get to a *guaranteed return on investment*, especially for dividend aristocrats. The stock can rise and fall and make me money on the way but regardless I get a return on my money every now and then that I can use to double down or diversify. Warren Buffet got rich partly due to dividends from solid companies. A bird in the hand is worth ten in the forest..."

2021-04-19 17:45:06,stocks,"I mean, are you not, too?

It seems like you are trying to build a portfolio to generate cash flow specifically. Do you need this extra cash flow for something or do you just prefer it that way? I don't fully understand your question.

Yes, you could load up on dividend stocks to get a cash flow going. You could also buy other stocks and not get any dividend at all, making the same money in the end. It's all based on performance, of course.

In the end, it doesn't matter how you make your money. If you like dividends go for it, but also keep in mind that many clear cut dividend investors are after the payouts because they live off of them. If your portfolio is ""just"" a side gig and you're saving up for the future and not taking any cash out, you aren't really in need of any dividends at all. The only real argument for dividends specifically would be if you know you will not be able to deposit any new money into the account, you can still raise a few % cash to buy new things if you don't want to sell positions."
2021-04-19 18:50:00,stocks,"Are you really open to diverse perspectives? 


I hear a lot of dividend investors say this but once the academic research comes out they get butt hurt and defensive."
2021-04-19 18:24:13,stocks,"No offense but with all due respect the person you‚Äôre responding to isn‚Äôt the one with the sentiment, it‚Äôs you. 

Cash in the bank for a company is going to be the same as cash being paid out to shareholders, dollar is a dollar as everyone agrees. It‚Äôs your impression that a dollar in hand is better than unrealized, but that‚Äôs just psychological. Someone could create their own dividend by selling a fraction of their position and ‚Äúlocking‚Äù it in as well. Added benefit, though, is you can choose not to. 

I understand people like dividends so they can avoid selling principal but that‚Äôs psychological. It‚Äôs them being uncomfortable with doing that which drives them to seek out dividends instead. I‚Äôd much rather invest in a company that doesn‚Äôt pay a dividend that is growing well and has strong management than a company that has to borrow money to cover their dividend and a payout ratio >100%. CVX is an example of this."

2021-04-19 18:02:22,stocks,"The basics of a companies profit is really 2 uses. If a company turns a profit it can choose to either 
1. It distribute the profit to share holders. 
2. Reinvest in the business like buying, hiring, building

When choosing #1 it can do it in form of a dividend which you are familiar with or it can do a share buyback. By buying more shares to treasury, it will limit the number of shares outstanding thus raise the share value. Both are comparable in theory though actual effect may differ. 

Choosing #1 meaning take on more risk because the expectation is you‚Äôre not paid now, but paid via future profit in form of higher share price of future ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù"
2021-04-19 17:56:15,stocks,"Cash on hand is good to have.  It can fund initiatives, acquisitions, growth, expansion, etc. with it. It could be invested to earn a return, It can be used to pay down debt too. It can be used for stock buy backs which theoretically are a return for shareholders.  Just having money in the bank is good to help weather downturns in the economy too. 

You are wrong to assume that every nickel needs to be spent right away.  That‚Äôs like a fool who spends his entire paycheck and lives a paycheck to paycheck lifestyle. Growth is often strategic and calculated.   Growth could be multi year plans that require a healthy balance sheet.  Companies are investing in growth and development in a manner that makes sense rather than just throwing money into the wind."

2021-04-19 17:17:22,stocks,"1) wash sale is 30 before and after

2) hypothetically everything is amazing if you assume quick 5x turn around.  

Real answer most traders lose money in the long run, so the 5x quick return is most likely not going to keep happening."
2021-04-19 17:18:42,stocks,There‚Äôs nothing wrong here other than the fact that it‚Äôs almost impossible to predict how the market will move within a given time frame. Even if you do manage to be profitable doing this you‚Äôd have to be extra profitable compared to buying and holding because you take a larger tax hit. I have a small account myself set aside for short term plays/degenerate speculations with options. It‚Äôs fun to mess around with but most of my money is in long term investments I.e index funds. You can give it try and see how to do but chances are in the long run you‚Äôll underperform the market. You might be able to get lucky in the short term.

2021-04-19 17:50:21,stocks,"One way of significantly reducing market risk is to implement a market neutral strategy using long-term in-the-money options.

Long-term options start behaving more like stocks the longer the duration, and the deeper in-the-money you go the less leverage is associated with the position and the lower the time-value cost of the position.

By buying calls on undervalued stocks and puts on overvalued stocks you end up profiting on the calls in a bull market, and on the puts in a bear market. Conversely, you lose on the puts in a bull market, and on the calls in a bear market. This essentially cancels out any influence the overall market has on your portfolio returns.

What you're left with is industry risk and company risk. So if you're calls generate more profit in a bull market than you lose on your puts, you turn a net profit. And if you're puts generate more profit in a bear market than you lose on your calls, you turn a net profit.

In the end, you have a portfolio that is uncorrelated with the overall market and if the markets crash you should be safe."
2021-04-19 16:57:53,stocks,Start by protecting what you have. Cash is king at times like that.
2021-04-19 17:55:41,stocks,"Be a psychic and pull your money out the minute before it crashes, then also use your psychic abilities to buy back in at the absolute bottom.

Joking aside, it's probably best to continually buy in as the market crashes since you won't know when it reached the bottom.  You can also look into sectors or companies you think got unfairly decimated by the crash and buy heavily into those, hoping they recover well.

The psychology of continually buying as the market loses several points per day is tough though.  It's easy to imagine doing that right now, but when you see your portfolio value drop 8% day after day, shoveling free cash into investments isn't easy."
2021-04-19 17:14:24,stocks,"The best way to profit off of a crash is to buy in at increments. You can not reliably predict when a crash will happen, so it is not best to buy an inverse or go all cash in my opinion. I would also not go short on any position (ever).

Think of it like a random Black-Friday sale. So long as the companies that you are buying are good companies, they'll bounce back up fairly quickly. This of course depends on the reason for the crash, though most things will fall in sympathy for the market during a huge crash as fear gets the best of people."

I use a 1yr chart, & look at stochastics, RSI, MACD & moving average, sometimes BBands.  And will check charts on at least 2 platforms (ToS, TDAmeriT, TradingView, YahooFinance).

Look at chart on $URA.  I'm mad bullish on this.  Right now its riding the bottom of an upward price channel, & should pop above $20.  Dividend only pays out 2x/yr: June & Dec, so thats coming up soon.  Normally I sell covered calls on my positions, but Im not on URA cause I dont want to get called out before dividends (this has happened to me with $PHG).

I check positions on my phone a few times per day, just to check on things.  Otherwise Im going on about my business.  Also depends on what kind of positions I have
For example, Im short Peleton, so I'll be checking a little more frequently.  When I was short gold, I was also checking much more due to volitility & me being leveraged.

1) Transfer from a Chase checking to You Invest (now called Investments by J.P. Morgan) is instantaneous during market hours. Outside of market hours I think it waits until next business open. I'm not sure about non-Chase to You Invest.

2) Settlement time recently changed to no later than the beginning of the 2nd day. For example, order placed Mon 3pm ET will settle no later than Weds morning

2021-04-19 16:53:42,stocks,We have been in a bull market for a record amount of time.  Growth surges in a bull market but crashes just as hard in a beat market.  That is the downside.  So it depends on wether you are bullish or bearish.

2021-04-19 18:23:24,stocks,">As in why wouldn't everyone just go for these growth funds if they perform this well?

look at the year-by-year data going back to inception, or as long as possible. there are stretches when growth stocks are on a wining streak, other times when they under-perform the broader market or value stocks. some investors will bail out at the first sign of trouble or underperformance, relatively few will ride it out during a rough patch. 

compare FBGRX: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FBGRX/performance/

with DODGX, a large value fund: 
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DODGX/performance?p=DODGX

Plus if you are reinvesting over many years the lower expense ratio does make a large difference in overall growth.  IE compound interest.

2021-04-19 16:15:58,stocks,"Market cap = share price x total issued shares.

When a valuation (market cap) seems high it‚Äôs because the market expects future profit/cash flow of the company to grow thus making the current valuation seem fair.  Obviously not everyone agrees with a current valuation so some people are buying, selling, long or short at any one time. So yes earnings have to grow and it doesn‚Äôt always happen thus stocks tank."
2021-04-19 16:10:20,stocks,"Its all speculative based on what sector its in and what potential growth is expected. Watch some YouTube videos about valuation. And if a 10% rise saw a $3 billion growth in market cap the next 10% would be more. Its to do with how many shares are outstanding.

Edit: so if company A has 1,000,000 shares at $1 each that a market cap of $1,000,000. 
Company B has 10,000 shares at $100 each thats the same market cap.
Company A goes up $1 it has doubled its market cap, company B goes up $1 and its now worth $1,010,000"
2021-04-19 16:13:27,stocks,If they build something new or create more value for customers they get more valuable as a company. And when they get more valuable then their stock price usually rises in relation to that new value that they create. If Duke energy for example opens a new plant and it creates $10 million of value for customers the market cap should go up around $10 million too. At least that‚Äôs the best way I can explain it.
2021-04-19 16:14:28,stocks,"&#x200B;

>Now for the easiest way to ask this question: If every 10% in share price $SNOW rises, the market cap rises by 3 billion. So what actually has to happen for them to be an actually fairly valued company. Is it earnings have to grow? Without the stock price rises along side earnings.

&#x200B;

Not really, honesty. Marketcap is just outstanding shares multiplied by the share price.

To explain it: Snowflake currently has 288.7 million outstanding shares. Their price currently sits at around 229 dollar, which gives them a marketcap of around 66 billion (288.700.000 X stock price of 229$). If a share would be worth 10% as much, it'd be trading at 252$, which would but them at a marketcap of 72$ billion. 

Obviously the biggest tell is indeed a company their earnings. The reason why snowflake (and some other company) have such a high valuation is because they show good YoY growth and they are active in an industry that has high margins."

‚ÄúEveryone has their own style, whether it be focusing on growth stocks, going for dividends, focusing on a sector, or whatever. Your investing style may not be optimal but it is what **you are comfortable with.**‚Äù


I think this is a really important distinction. We all want to get the most returns we can, but that means investing in your style.

2021-04-19 15:40:05,stocks,"I agree with what you‚Äôre saying but I think asking these questions helps people develop their investing style. That and taking losses. 

I think this is great advice but I would still say that people with these types of questions should still go ahead and ask."
2021-04-19 17:16:00,stocks,"While I agree in principle, I also find that it‚Äôs important to expand your risk tolerance over time in proportion to your skill.  This helps you master lower risk trades and also improve your returns over time.

Investing is like learning how to ski.  You need to be comfortable with the fact that you‚Äôre probably going to fall when you move into new terrain.  If you don‚Äôt get comfortable with that, you‚Äôll be stuck on the bunny slopes forever.  You might never realize your potential."
2021-04-19 15:52:34,stocks,I agree and thanks for the award! Everyone has a different approach to investing and different knowledge. What works for one person won't work for another (I'm talking about specific investing strategies not passive investing).
2021-04-19 15:50:04,stocks,I completely agree. Asking is always a great way to learn and I encourage it!
2021-04-19 15:50:18,stocks,"Uhhhh. 


According to Google Finance over the last year: 


IWM: +83.48% 


S&P500: +47.31% 


And over the last 5 years: 


IWM: +93.85% 


S&P500: +98.84% 


So it just depends on your time frame. Sometimes stocks go up, sometimes they go own and sometimes they trade flat. IWM is exposed to more stocks including some mid caps."
2021-04-19 16:22:21,stocks,".88 correlation is pretty high, but it‚Äôs still low enough to offer diversification benefits."
2021-04-19 15:45:43,stocks,ü©≥
2021-04-19 16:34:58,stocks,Good point! Probably their correlation will return to the mean over time.
2021-04-19 18:40:34,stocks,Actually the biggest winner has been Roku. Their shares have risen more than Netflix and any other streaming company.
2021-04-19 15:24:54,stocks,"I have Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, & HBONow, among others. 99% of the time, we are on Hulu. 

We have binged all the shows that interest us on Netflix, and only go to it for my wife‚Äôs addiction to Criminal Minds & SVU reruns. 

I can‚Äôt see how Netflix continues to grow. So much of their ‚Äúnew‚Äù content is horribly dubbed from other languages."
2021-04-19 15:48:52,stocks,"Netflix has a few good shows. But, once Disney really starts to push this streaming service with even more Marvel, Star Wars, etc. they will ultimately win imo."
2021-04-19 15:19:38,stocks,"Netflix is good, Disney is better. More growth potential for Disney, more diversification, more money."
2021-04-19 16:25:18,stocks,So hard to believe I thought it was over for Netflix but Disney has been sort of disappointing. Very Intresting
2021-04-19 18:09:00,stocks,The great thing about Disney is streaming is only one part of their income stream. They also have live sports with ESPN and Disney World. If they beat Netflix it is icing on the cake but they dont need to.
2021-04-19 15:40:31,stocks,Netflix is good but Disney seems better in almost every way. Idk how you can compete against the behemoth run by the mouse. In one year they attained what took Netflix more than a decade.
2021-04-19 15:21:48,stocks,"Disney with the Hulu and espn package...  
I don‚Äôt see Netflix long term with Amazon having prime as a streaming too.

Seems like everyone can get what they need with Amazon and then Disney for kids and the espn part for sports.

I dunno... anyone else?"
2021-04-19 16:02:34,stocks,"I think that the competition amongst streaming services is what the market is all about. All these streaming services offer mostly unique showings, and it's exciting to wonder which service people will enjoy the most. In that way, the more affluent can enjoy the services of *all* the major competitors--who's to say picking streaming services has to be mutually exclusive? A lot of analysis seems to hinge on the assumption that one can only pick Netflix OR Disney+ OR Hbomax OR Amazon Prime. People can have them all."
2021-04-19 16:38:00,stocks,its called netflix and chill not disney plus and chill. no one wants to fuck to a kids movie
2021-04-19 18:20:44,stocks,Begun the streaming wars have.
2021-04-19 15:25:31,stocks,The real loser is HBO Max
2021-04-19 16:04:49,stocks,Content is King. Disney FTW long term.
2021-04-19 16:08:58,stocks,"In a similar spot here. We barely use Netflix anymore. A lot of the content we used to watch there is now hosted on other platforms that wised up. We refuse to watch any of the Netflix Original series because weve been burned so many times by a series that started and got abandoned after a season. 

Netflix is good occasionally for an interesting ""Limited Series"", like the one they recently released on the art heist at the museum, but 90% of our netflix using is signing on, looking around at the exact same 10 titles listed under 45 different categories, then saying ""Fuck this"" and going to Hulu. 

I think Netflix really needs to get their shit together or they are going to get left in the dust. Hulu, HBO Max, and Prime video see the vast majority of our usage. I only have Netflix because I am on a family account, I wouldnt pay for it if that wasnt the case."
2021-04-19 17:14:36,stocks,Disney+ hasn't reached full potential yet. It will be a juggernaut in 2022/2023 once the Marvel and Star Wars show pipeline has matured
2021-04-19 16:39:16,stocks,"Honestly have been running out of enjoyable content on Netflix. I've started watching things on Amazon prime, but family nights it's always stuff on Disney+."
2021-04-19 17:33:43,stocks,"I think STAR is going to be the real game changer for Disney+. The platform as it stands is pretty much for kids and comic book movie/Star Wars nerds. Netflix and HBO serve much more diverse content. But Disney owns gobs of non-family entertainment through NBC, Fox, etc. that they're not using yet.

Once that stuff is up, along with all the new adult oriented content they have planned, I think subscriptions are going to take off even more."
2021-04-19 18:02:05,stocks,"If they can pump out some better star wars content (more about the movie than shows), The two marvel TV series have been pretty solid and received alot of praise. 

Netflix has a better UI ( think this is the right term). Content is mixed with people overall, especially me. 

I feel people are going to transition streaming services in cycles, and im not sure how that will effect financials. Mainly due to the rising cost and amount of available streaming services."
2021-04-19 15:20:57,stocks,"Disney has content Netflix can‚Äôt compete with right now.

Nothing stopping Netflix from creating content on par but themselves."
2021-04-19 19:14:14,stocks,"Disney surely can grow but saying their the top dog is an extremely US-centric point of view that will lose people money. The rest of the world isn't obsessed with Disney, not like you are. We like the occasional star wars but we're not diehard fans, we feel nostalgic for old Disney films but won't pay monthly to see them. Even as a ""kids option"" the competition is fierce and Disneys lack of new content hurts.




However their biggest flaw is their lack of variety. I can take 10 people from across thw told of different race, gender and class and they'll all find something on Netflix. They'll not love it but it'll be *good enough to keep watching* which is what Disney lacks. We had it for a month but saw all we (as a family) wanted to see in a mere two weeks, not even the kids bothered after seeing Frost 7 times. Netflix is the core of any streaming portfolio, I'll always keep it and add Disney/HBO/Crunchy roll/Whatever as I need more. But I'm always loyal to Netflix because it's the only *jack of all trades* whine Disney/HBO etc are very slim in their offerings."
2021-04-19 18:38:35,stocks,I hate Disney plus interface. It feels so clunky. Also the Marvel and Star Wars shows cost a ton to produce and I feel like there is a market cap for those people.
2021-04-19 18:27:06,stocks,"You just don't know what you are doing. Disney movies are the absolute best for seduction.

Want a guaranteed successful way to go for a kiss on a girl? Watch The Little Mermaid and wait for the ""Kiss The Girl"" song to start playing. Then emulate what is happening on screen. Works every time.

When you are ready to take it to the next level then you break out The Lion King and wait for ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" to start playing."
2021-04-19 15:33:03,stocks,it does seem like they have shat the bed in terms of their business model. too bad bc as a film fan it‚Äôs really great. if you want to watch classic hollywood or foreign films it‚Äôs got an incredible selection
2021-04-19 18:41:21,stocks,You don't think their technological marvel is fully armed and operational yet?
2021-04-19 15:44:43,stocks,It‚Äòs hard to build brands that can compete with the ones that are decades or even a hundred years old as are Disney‚Äòs.
2021-04-19 15:50:01,stocks,"I still can't believe Netflix canned Patriot Act. That show was seriously amazing and was one of my favorite things they had going on. Oh well, guess that's what they get for calling out Netflix's tax dodging on their last show üò∂"
2021-04-19 17:41:02,stocks,"netflix's whole strategy is quantity over quality (supported by data to give people what it is they want) and on that front, they're winning

i have some reservations with it long term, but more likely or not netflix will continue to grow on that strategy (while other streamers, like hbo and apple, push quality and disney pushes IP)"
2021-04-19 16:37:07,stocks,"If you are a 15-35 year old tech savvy male you might think this, but you‚Äôre in the minority of streaming subscribers these days.  Most people who stream are watching re-runs of old shows, not originals.  Hence why the office is still the most watched show on Netflix despite it not being on Netflix for years.

Disney has the best library.  And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs powering them right now.  All this talk about disney+ not having any content is malarkey."
2021-04-19 18:40:22,stocks,Also they had arguably the best franchise in television history and completely ruined it by rushing the series finale and failing to set up anything after it or ride it out.
2021-04-19 15:36:02,stocks,"AT&T fucked it up

Total clowns"

I can see Disney having more and more shows, and maybe even movies, use it"
2021-04-19 17:02:10,stocks,"Very true. But it‚Äôs not impossible.

If you think Netflix is just willing to let Disney have better content you‚Äôre insane.  The likely outcome is they spend lots of money and fail, but they could succeed."
2021-04-19 17:23:01,stocks,They did?  Was wondering where the new season was...
2021-04-19 17:01:05,stocks,"I think you replied to the wrong person?

I said Disney has the better content...."
2021-04-19 15:37:35,stocks,that company is absolutely toxic. everything they touch turns to shit
2021-04-19 17:16:00,stocks,"I am convinced that Netflix will grow too, but Disney will outperform because they simply have more leverage and intellectual property they can milk."
2021-04-19 17:34:22,stocks,"They even [caned the channel and had it redirect to their Netflix Is A Joke](https://i.imgur.com/ptw1rgj.png) so you can't sort easily through their old catalog üò≠

2021-04-19 18:03:57,stocks,"Second this. 

Only possible move was LOTR? But even that has limited following. 

Witcher could be good, but that is also limited in scope as well"
2021-04-19 19:17:19,stocks,"Disney has espn. No one else in streaming can touch that. ESPN plus is a joke. Once Disney adds espn to the streaming mix it‚Äôs game over.

They also might avoid adding it to keep premiums high at cable providers."
2021-04-19 17:51:11,stocks,That's a bummer.  I liked the show.  Hopefully he gets a contract somewhere else soon.
2021-04-19 15:19:18,stocks,There‚Äôs no volume so there‚Äôs nothing to update
2021-04-19 15:36:29,stocks,"If you're a US based investor, it's likely you should be looking at LVMUY instead. This is the LVMHF ADR traded via otc. The price is less because each ADR holds a fraction of a normal share. 

Remember that a lot of international equity is traded via ADR in the US so you don't need an account to try to buy the equity directly via the foreign exchange. Usually the ""F"" on the end of an otc equity means foreign."
2021-04-19 15:22:17,stocks,"what does that mean? I find that hard to believe since it's one of the top end stocks out there.

the swings in this seem purely bc they aren't being updated fast enough

But there won‚Äôt be second by second price movements"
2021-04-19 15:30:37,stocks,And it‚Äôs not exactly cheap.  For that share price I‚Äôd rather something that wasn‚Äôt OTC.  Probably not the easiest position to get in and out of.
2021-04-19 15:45:34,stocks,"This is a fundamental question of what is the difference between buying the ADR vs. the foreign stock which might be worth reading about on investopedia or elsewhere via google search.

An ADR might not represent a full share (as it doesn't in this case) and there is some counter party risk due to the bank holding the shares. Also ADR doesn't always get voting rights. 

Generally the ADR will always have higher trading volume in the states versus the foreign version of the equity."
2021-04-19 15:33:00,stocks,that was my thought a month ago and since then it's gone from 662 to 759 practically constantly going up.
2021-04-19 16:07:34,stocks,"still sorta confused but I looked at a comparison and still think LVMHF looks better. 

https://financhill.com/compare/industry/luxury-goods/LVMHF-vs-LVMUY

I dont care about voting rights, I just want full access to all of their brands with the stock I buy."
2021-04-19 16:14:52,stocks,">still sorta confused

One is an ADR and one is not. I'd suggest looking up and understanding what an ADR is and it will be less confusing. Investopedia should have a bunch of info on it. 


Example: 

https://www.google.com/finance/quote/TSM:NYSE

TSM is an ADR traded on the NYSE. It is an ADR of ""2330"" which is the ticker for TSM equity sold on the TPE exchange."

These guys talk long term investing strategy and give index fund allocations for the long term.

2) supposedly investing money lump term outperforms dollar cost average (dca) 2/3 of the time, but I prefer to dca anyway.  If it goes up, you're happy because you have a piece. If it goes down, you're happy because you got to buy more for cheaper.

3) I don't know PAVE and SOXX but ARKK is pretty high risk.  I wouldn't put it in the same category as VTI, but in the same bucket as any individual stock.

2021-04-19 14:43:36,stocks,Is SquareSpace going public? Their product is honestly fantastic.
2021-04-19 15:37:58,stocks,"GME already had a share sale program. The old program allowed them to sell a maximum of 6 million shares, raising at most 100 million USD. They didn't have to sell everything, but at most they could sell 6 million shares or raise at most 100 million, once one of those numbers was reached the program was done.
They recently announced a change to this plan, they will now sell at most 3.5 million shares, with a cap of 1 billion USD. So they expect to raise 10x as much money while selling slightly over half the shares they planned to before.
Does this sound like a good or a bad thing?"
2021-04-19 13:35:38,stocks,Usually dilution causes stock value to go down.  GME/AMC is in a special situation where they're a retail frenzy.
2021-04-19 13:42:49,stocks,"If the company can use the new money from dilution wisely then it's a win for existing investors. That's because what matters isn't so much your % of the company, but rather the size of the company itself."
2021-04-19 14:04:54,stocks,A company cannot sell stocks against the interest of it's owners. A permission for secondary public offering is given in the general meeting. The board of directors also acts in the interest of the owners. It should make sure that company issues new stocks only for good reasons. One reason is the company is in deep trouble and secondary public offering is the best way to get new capital.

2021-04-19 16:40:22,stocks,Is there a way to search for share sale programs in a database?
2021-04-19 13:42:15,stocks,But why would anyone buy a companies stock again if that company demonstrates its willingness to dilute the stock? Assuming other companies dilute as well
2021-04-19 13:52:54,stocks,"There‚Äôs inherently risk involved though hoping that the company will grow by a greater amount than the dilution of ownership.

As a large investor you have the voting power to decide if you want to take on that risk. But as an individual investor isn‚Äôt it much less attractive since you now have no control over the risk level? What if I preferred the company issue debt instead? Especially in this low rate high inflation environment."
2021-04-19 14:44:59,stocks,Can it sell more stocks in the interest of 51% of the owners? And would bigger investors have different incentives than smaller investors?
2021-04-19 14:25:50,stocks,"Because the dilution has a purpose: to raise money for company growth or to pay down debt. Assuming shareholders trust management and believe dilution to be a temporary hit to a profitable long term investment, you‚Äôll see people hang on or invest once the dust has settled. Ultimately, what matters is what the company does with the newly raised funds and whether or not that value will go back to shareholders in the end."
2021-04-19 13:43:39,stocks,I don't know man. AMC diluted it a few times but people are still YOLO their entire life savings into it believing in a short squeeze or thinking they are saving the movies from going bankrupt.  It's counter intuitive to be. I don't get it either.
2021-04-19 13:45:42,stocks,"The dilution changes some things but overall, the sentiment behind the investors‚Äô original purchase remains the same."
2021-04-19 13:56:22,stocks,"Yes, agreed that there is risk involved. But as a small individual investor clearly your opinion doesn't matter much, just like they aren't asking you if they should roll out a new product line or create new stores."
2021-04-19 15:32:56,stocks,"Though rare, it can happen. I know almost an example. Italian Grimaldi Group had bought major share of Finnish shipping company Finnlines. They were planning to acquire the whole company and did not want to pay dividends out of it. One minority owner, a Finnish insurance company, demanded bigger dividends and it had some leverage to get that. Grimaldis said: ""If we have to pay the extra dividends, we will issue a secondary offering to collect that money back. Then you can choose between participating the offering and paying the money back, or having your ownership diluted."" Eventually that did not happen. Later Grimaldis got the whole company.

You don't want to own a company with that kind of majority owner."
2021-04-19 14:42:49,stocks,How do I figure out which companies to trust? Is there some resource that records the history of stock dilutions?
2021-04-19 14:22:14,stocks,"So why would anyone be a small individual investor? Seems like the big players are just going to try and use you as much as possible.

If I were a big investor I would create a schedule for stock purchases to seem fair. Then announce stock dilutions or big purchases right before I buy.  Also announce stock repurchases and new product lines right before I sell. Individual investors would buy in at higher prices on stock repurchase announcements. Then lose all that value on the next dilution announcement so I could buy in at a lower price."

2021-04-19 15:04:41,stocks,"I hear ya. Your only real option is to sell if you don't like it. I would also remind you that the big dogs are also share holders, so you are mostly on their side anyways. The market has apparently decided GME is worth this many billions and the company is just using this fact for more capital at this valuation, again if you think that's crazy then you just shouldn't be owning the stock."

2021-04-19 15:35:14,stocks,">Do I convert my cash into something else that might not be as affected by our economy? What would that even be?

That's what asset allocation is all about. I'm sure you read how people put X% in bonds, gold, real estate, whatever. Depending if you think you might need liquidity during a crash, you keep in your portfolio a % of assets that are relatively unaffected by the ups and downs of equities. So if your stocks drop 80% your bonds/gold/whatever are unaffected (or rise!). The cost is that when equities are doing well you are most likely not gonna get as much growth in the other assets.

For more : [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp)  


Edit : If you access to cashflow (usually income) during a crash you are better off continuing to buy (probably in an index fund/etf) as the stocks will go back up and you'll make nice gains. Might even sell the assets that did not lose value to buy the dips. But that has its risks (like the market didn't go up soon enough and suddenly you no longer have cashflow), like in everything."

2021-04-19 14:45:10,stocks,"Lots of joking answers, but if you want a real answer: look at the Japanese lost decade.

In that specific example, both stocks and real estate proved to lose their value.

Bonds held their value due to the Bank of Japan suppressing inflation, but the Fed seems willing to accept inflation. Bonds will be safer then stocks in a crash, but I suppose you want something better.

The best bet for Japanese investors would be the US stock market, but that doesn't really help you. It's highly unlikely that any stock market will perform well if the US market crashes.

What remains then?

Gold, silver and, perhaps, those bitty coins seem like the safest bet.

However, timing is difficult. Those coins are at ATH right now and might go crashing down if tech stocks crash, so in that sense Gold seems like it has a better price point right now.
This is not investment advice, but I think if you were to get good investment advice, Gold or other valuable commodities might be the best choice.

I myself am hedging with the bitty coins though, since I think Gold is on a long term decline vs. those coins. But it's a really bad strategy. Don't do as I do, do as I say.

Should you decide to diversify, my suggestion is to choose a percentage of your portfolio that you want to be hedged (5%? 10%? 30%?) And then ease into it over a few days or weeks. Always sell at high points, always buy at low points, if possible."

2021-04-19 19:10:00,stocks,"I gave my general answer above which is, simply, don't worry about hedging against a crash unless you need that money in the short term, but one serious answer to your question is desirable real estate (desirable being key). But of course, you have to have a very large portfolio for that to be an option, because desirable real estate is generally expensive. Also, it is relatively illiquid, especially during a crash, so it would help maintain your net worth but not a great way to protect your spending ability during a crash."

2021-04-19 16:00:47,stocks,"This is somewhat accurate.  Even used, guns barely depreciate, and it's really just an initial depreciation from new to used.  If you buy used guns they typically hold from that point.  The issue is liquidity.  Buying common guns, ie Glocks and other common striker fired pistols in 9mm, and AR-15s you can alleviate a lot of the liquidity issues, versus something like a lever action rifle or single action revolver.  Right now they are very liquid because demand is through the roof, but under normal years it could take some time to sell off a sizable collection.  That said, the current demand has prices temporarily elevated, so buying right now wouldn't be a good move.  During years where the gun community isn't panicked about bans you could sink cash into AR-15 lowers at about $50 a pop, and you could easily sell them off whenever you need to cash out, and if you end up holding them to a ""ban year"" you could sell them for $200 each for a tidy profit.

If you want to look at it as a collectible instead of a commodity, you could invest in true collector pieces like a Colt Python.  Less liquid, but can easily gain in value.  Downside is you now need to concern yourself with safe storage so your investment doesn't rust."
2021-04-19 17:26:16,stocks,"No, that is the right answer.  Everything except the percentages.  The percentages are guesses.

You can identify the bottom of a recession with some reasonable level of accuracy (if S&P falls more than 40%) so it's easy to know when to sell bonds.  It's very hard to identify the top of a market, which is why slow buying bonds is ideal.  If you want to do the 75%/25% you want to start that five years from the bottom of the previous dip.

I ended up with a 30% lose in my portfolio but by August I had an overall gain of 10% because of the stock I bought on the way down.   Just info maybe it will help."

You should be hedged for raging inflation and market collapse. For example, take a mortgage on a house and keep the cash to pay the mortgage. If inflation happens, house worth more. If crash happens, you have cash to buy in."
2021-04-19 18:25:12,stocks,"Ok, sometimes a stock falls under book value, but has a consistent dividend in it's past that never changes, and increases after the recession. You buy it for the solid 3-4% annual dividend. Now it pops and rises back up to book value. Another recession happens years later, but the dividend increased. Now you can dump more money in for a higher yield if you want at the irrationally undervalued price. When it goes back up to book value you make double or triple the gains of what you invested on the irrational dip. When the dividend does increase, so does the yearly yield % on whatever you invested. Usually start dollar cost averaging all the way back to the book value, then I just wait and see how far past it goes.

Usually those stocks only appear, when there is something like a natural disaster or a negative world event. Covid was the time to buy bank stocks."

I think bitties will follow tech stonks in the short term. If APPL and TSLA go down, bitties will go down too. How can they stay up? 
So Gold is a better hedge.

But I think bitties will displace Gold as a store of value. So bitties only go up. 

If I was 100% sure there was gonna be a crash in the next 12 months, I would sell everything now, buy gold and the buy stonks and bitties 2 years from now.

But what if the crash only happens 5 years from now? Or 10 years?

I believe in 2030 bitties will be worth much more than gold.

Only the stock market can crash and take the economy with it. Why does the economy fall with it? because if people take out loans that they cant pay back because the economy sucks in reality (which some people say is already the case) then lots of loans default which can lead to bankruptcy of banks. However the FED and ECB have shown their willingness to inject stimulus forever. So it's hard to say how a real crash would look like. 
What's more realistic (imo, im absolutely no expert and im fairly young so all I say is from reading not from actually experiencing it) is that the money printing will keep up the phony economy until some black swan event happens like covid. So impossible to say when that happens. 
What also might happen is stagflation like what was seen with japan for a long time. Just forever sideways trading because everything stays at the same valuations forever. 
But if inflation happens it's better to own stuff than to own cash."

2021-04-19 15:48:03,stocks,Look at at the chart of gold during the great depression (1929-1934). It's during times of uncertainty that demand for gold goes up and along with it it's price. We've been in a 12 year bull market which means the opportunity cost of holding gold has been high leading to lower demand and lower prices.

2021-04-19 15:21:26,stocks,"When people punish capitalism , they're only hurting themselves. Communism and socialism and every other ism cost us 100 million lives and probably more, historically. I hope you meant to convey that the notion of capitalism as something that is being punished poses a danger to humanity and our markets. I'd also point out that even communist/fascist China uses capitalism even within their broken dangerous inhuman system so that they allow their economies to flourish. But they're unwillingness to take their paws off of free enterprise taints their efforts and ultimately costs them even more meaningful growth. Look at what's going on with the Jack Ma/Alibaba/Ant Group/Communist party debacle. 

But we are in an interesting global economy though I would agree; and there are interesting things going on. But, the economic curve keeps shifting upward and to the right, and the Technology factor like automation during the industrial revolution,  and later the internet, and now the  Block chain is about to revolutionize our world even more. If I remember correctly from my economics courses, The aggregate production¬†function and the makeup of GNP formula pn a macro level talks about this.

Human ingenuity and goodness and the American ideal will always win out in the end. So if we can just get rid of fascist and communist  nonsense once and for all, we'd be greater again. üòâ

So I daresay as bad as things may be in certain areas, in other areas we're doing pretty well. I just think people haven't really seen this kind of growth before and we keep breaking records, especially here in the USA. So naturally they're afraid of a crash. But we're having another technological revolution, so we're probably pretty damn good for a long while yet."

Any money the FDIC gives out comes from its reserves. If they run out, the Fed, Treasury, or Congress may be able to cover for them.

But people take that money and put it right back into another bank.

The interesting part is the excess above the 250k that FDIC doesn't cover. That disappears from depositors net worth, but, again, it doesn't even exist in the bank. Somewhere there is corresponding debt owed to the bank that now doesn't pass through to depositors.

If you have multiple lots you can avoid fees by selling all of them at once for one fee of $6.95...Another thing to look out for is E-Trades default setting of ""First In First Out"" when selling a specific lot of shares. I FOMO'ed into a penny stock a few months ago at just over .007 which of course ended up being peak price and slowly averaged down as the price dropped ending up with 5 separate lots. When the price started to come back up I tried selling my one lowest priced lot of 20k shares at .0048 for a small profit and instead it pulled from my 3 highest priced lots for a decent sized loss.

I personally find more value in reading and evaluating the DD the paid members perform on their picks, and also reading their personal disclosure policy on whether they own stocks or not, showing their personal conviction.

At MF SA (and other paid ones), at least they have employees that are paid to come up with the DD.  Sure they might be overvalued, but remember- the SA picks are recommended for the long haul.  If you expect to pick up short term trading, you indeed might need to pick up more expensive services they offer. 

I just ignore the pop ups.  After a couple times, I don't even notice it. 

I definitely know that MF's nonpaid articles, written by forum people, are click bait material and not very informative.  There are picks with in SA that the CEOs and the chief staff there purchased, those I look around to see and then end up buying (after the initial spike).  

You are mentioning the ones that are trading sideways or aren't doing well.  There were ones such as LAM research that had a very nice gain (I wasn't able to buy myself) after their pick.  Also- they are evaluating as a long time investment, not for quick sale. 

I personally have a full time job and also don't know the ins and outs to go through a decent DD, therefore I found good use of this service.  I have also been burned this year as a consequence of buying stocks from reddit.  I am slowly transitioning to their picks and plan on staying long term."

2021-04-19 17:16:16,stocks,"I subscribed and regret it. Also ""Rule Breakers"" list of stocks is *very* similar to the other list of stocks. 

It is a lot of spam e-mails, almost all the stocks  they recommend are overvalued (which they justify because they're to be held 1-3 years - but some of them are so overvalued that still doesn't make sense).

Their DD is often incredibly surface.

They don't offer current market info. Everything is behind the curve. Often, they'll send out a member blast about a stock *after* the stock moves so they can seem like they called it when really they reported it after the fact.

They have ""live"" events which aren't and often amount to pump and dump events.

They constantly drive you to try and buy more of their packages, offers, etc.

As far as their blistering hot percentage returns on the market - it's sketchy AF.

First of all, if you have Tesla/Amazon etc. in your portfolio over the last few years, it's going to bring the rest of your portfolio up a lot.

That doesn't mean the *overall* stock picks are good. It means a few are good and bring the rest up.

A more accurate representation would be to compare stocks individually to track performance since they were selected.

Also, that crazy high percentage doesn't account for the allocation in portfolio (which they don't have specific parameters on). So, yes, Tesla went up 300%, but if you bought 1 share of that at $100 and bought 5,000 shares of a dud company at $200 (and they have lots of duds on their list) that is a 50% loss, then it doesn't mean your portfolio made a 250% return.

I have found zero use for them. They recommend very little that is different from what everyone else recommends.

Waste of money, as far as I'm concerned."

### ""Foolish Four"" and dot-com bust

In 1999, the Motley Fool was criticized by Jason Zweig for its ""Foolish Four"" investment theory.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-12) This idea had been marketed as a way to ""crush [mutual funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund) \[in\] only 15 minutes a year"" by using a mathematical formula to find stocks predicted to grow much more than average.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-14)  In 2000, Motley Fool writer Ann Coleman admitted that the Foolish Four  method ""turned out to be not nearly as wonderful a strategy as we  thought.""[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-15)\[[*better¬†source¬†needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS)\] 

During the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) and market collapse of 2001, the company lost 80% of its staff in three rounds of layoffs.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-16) It also closed its operations in Germany and Japan, which have since been reestablished.\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] 

### Expansion

In April 2002, The Motley Fool shifted to a [subscription-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model) business model with the launch of its first subscription service for investment advice.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-17)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-18)  The company launched their Stock Advisor program which is still in  service today. The Stock Advisor program offers monthly stock picks and  premium investment education to subscribers.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-19)[\[1\]](https://trefort.net/motley-fool-the-stock-advisor-reviews/) 

The company also established free and subscription-based  businesses in several countries. As of 2019, The Motley Fool has  operations in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom),[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-20) [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia),[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-21) [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada),[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-22) [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany),[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-23) and [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan).[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-24) In October 2019, the company announced that it was shutting down operations in [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore).[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-25) A year later, in October 2020, the company announced that it was also shutting down operations in [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong).[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool#cite_note-26)"

2021-04-19 17:57:33,stocks,"Depends. Want to be a trader or an investor? For investing they give some pretty good tips even though they do spam a lot of stuff they do have a good track record. I use them as a kind of heads up. See the advisor selection and then dive into those from there and pick what I think will do the best out of those and one thing they say a lot is that your winners will be bigger than your losers. Considering losers can only go to 0 and winners could run for a long time, it‚Äôs not wrong... lol."

2021-04-19 18:18:56,stocks,"Motley Fool has some great educational resources. But the stock advisor won't tell you anything. Basically buy FANG and similar stocks. Totally useless. And they constantly upsell you and lock stuff behind paywalls, even if you're a subscriber. If you got it for free from amex then, sure why not, but don't bother renewing it."

2021-04-19 19:34:48,stocks,I think you are wrong.  It doesn‚Äôt seem like a scam.  It is clearly and obviously a scam.
2021-04-19 19:40:54,stocks,"I'd never subscribe but in an fairness I do know people who've had success with it. They happened to be older people who don't really have the time or patience to learn how to screen for picks.

IMO it's bc they're able to pump stocks, it's a feedback loop and what they promote might pump bc they promoted it. Kinda like Cramer.

Is that useful? Idk. It's going to depend on your method of investing here and what works for you.

Problem is they're an outdated method of getting information. So many better tools out there and frankly the way they come across is just hard to look at. Their rare buy now alerts make my eyes bleed."
2021-04-19 19:42:12,stocks,I'm pretty sure these Motley Fool posts are just karma farming at this point
2021-04-19 19:45:53,stocks,It‚Äôs run by a hedge fund.
2021-04-19 19:46:40,stocks,"Long time investor speaking.  Your time and money is better spent on learning how to analyze a company you believe in and understand , or investing in an index fund or ETF.

2021-04-19 19:46:50,stocks,You can pretty much google their stock tips
2021-04-19 19:48:59,stocks,MF is terrible. They are their own hedge-fund so if you ever see them shitting on something it probably means that they are short on it. Can't tell truth from fiction with that lot.

2021-04-19 19:59:13,stocks,"I've tried a couple of services:

SeekingAlpha: Not worth it. Lots of wannabe analysts with hopium. Every stock will have wild predictions. Sell side analyst garbage.

Sentimentrader: Good market charts and indicators, but the studies are just backtests. No real predictions or stock picks. Just ""this might happen based on past charts."" If you want an indicator and market sentiment service, it's OK. 

FSInsight: Actually good. Stock picks, market rotation. Sure, it's a bit of a pump and dump, but they justify their picks with estimated PE. But this is definitely a ""buy the value dip"" strategy and rarely sell."
2021-04-19 15:11:06,stocks,"I signed up with them too and they had the same stocks you mentioned. They also had SHOP, MASI, CRWD, etc. Well, I lost close to 30% of my investments in a few days.

2021-04-19 13:00:18,stocks,"Just ignore all the crap and use their picks. You can day trade them and make money since so many people use the service, it pumps any stock they recommend immediately."
2021-04-19 13:27:33,stocks,"I signed up for the trial and soon canceled.  They are experts only at selling you new shit and never actually reveal any good stock recommendations or if they accidentally do, it is hidden by their marketing stuff"

I have lost respect for them."
2021-04-19 15:35:59,stocks,Motley Fool is actually a hedge fund. I wish I was being sarcastic. So I would suspect the info they are pushing is only for their best interest.

2021-04-19 15:44:02,stocks,Take a look into the hedge fund they operate. Motley fool asset management. Think a lot of their picks are ones they have in their portfolio. AKA it is in their interests to ‚Äúpick‚Äù these for us as good buys

2021-04-19 15:57:41,stocks,The Fool mainly regurgitates what the major analysts are saying.  If you don't know much about the market they can provide some foundation.  I still look at their free stuff to see if I know the stocks that are pumping.  I find one or two a month that has some interest.   There is lot of free information around that has as much value.
2021-04-19 15:58:37,stocks,They charged my credit card on auto renew when they were sending emails saying they were going to cancel if I didn‚Äôt renew. I had to have the charges reversed.
2021-04-19 15:58:50,stocks,Very disappointed in it too.  I couldn't find simple examples of those top 10 stocks both their advisors picked to be winners and other things they advertised.   Much of the news I found seemed already well known and the stock prices were already much higher (or bombed out) than the articles talked about.
2021-04-19 15:59:14,stocks,It‚Äôs the worst !!!  I tired it one year just to see and have a true opinion on it.  And I can honestly say it‚Äôs by far one of the worst investing scam subscriptions out there

You look at the stock when they make a recommendation and it's almost always peaking - as if I'm going to jump into that even if it is a good company.

2021-04-19 16:10:32,stocks,I got a refund 3 months into having paid for Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers on the grounds they didn't inform when to sell and there's further products they'll continue to try to sell you without the ability to unsubscribe.
2021-04-19 16:12:14,stocks,"I could be a moron (likely) but when they first came out (first book) I found them refreshing and ate up all their advice.

Turned out their dogs of the Dow was wrong and they seemed to have evolved to clickbait trash at this point.  

I agree with people saying run and deep down it makes me kind of sad.   Reddit is kind of the current version of what I was seeking then (90‚Äôs yeah I‚Äôm old)"

They mentioned skilz and I was interested just because ms.wood bought them up and it‚Äôs going to be huge in the internet gaming realm. But then again I tell myself why not just throw it all in SPY or VTI and chill and do other things lol. I also got annoyed with the upwelling, and hate when people do that so I canceled but I purchased the thing for a year so it‚Äôll end in July. Over all haven‚Äôt found the service to be as helpful as Reddit or Twitter tbh"

The whole thing seems super dodgy to me and I dont trust anything they say now

Many people have validated this. I think maybe their brand is a little bit tarnished because their free content is such garbage, but stock advisor is a good service. 

I‚Äôve read a lot of the negative reviews on trust pilot. I think my advice is just use stock advisor as a data input, a signal in your overall investing strategy.

How do you know that the testimonials from the people you hear from online are all long time traders?  Far as I am concerned, many are ""retail investors"" that don't know very much, bots, or pump & dump fanatics, on social networks online.  Even if you find the right ones, the initial process to find and continually vet them are time consuming.

I am trusting the testimonials of the paid employees of a company that has been existing for longer than I was around and keeping this business successful by investing.

2021-04-19 13:30:39,stocks,">you can find much cheaper and better alternatives than a $2000 bike with a screen attached to it

Yes, but that doesn't make the product ""bad."" You can find cheaper and better alternatives to an iPhone as well, but Apple's stock isn't exactly plummeting. Peloton makes a very solid bike, the classes are high quality and the brand, at least in the fitness space, is comparable to Apple and Tesla. You mention the cult following, but I think you downplay it a bit, as its supremely important. People with Peloton bikes are irritatingly enthusiastic about it, recommending it to everyone and posting their rides on social media.

>The target audience is people who wanna pay money to feel like they're working out, not people who actually exercise.

I think this is a bit hyperbolic - having access to 24/7 spin classes in your home, as well as the wealth of other classes available (strength, running, yoga, pilates, etc) isn't some sort of fake exercise like you seem to be implying here. It's legitimate and works if you put in the work (and after spending what you must to enter the ecosystem, I think a lot of people do). 

But, I understand the sentiment - big time fitness gurus don't need instagram celebrities motivating them to get on a bike a few times a week. They're hitting the gym regularly and likely have a full home gym that probably cost them less than the PTON bike alone. They really aren't the Peloton target market - but I think the market for people who just want to be in better shape, have some extra cash and want to own the latest shiny thing is probably bigger and easier to penetrate anyways. Many of these people do not like the gym and would welcome the opportunity to stay in shape in their bedroom or basement.

Finally, my other bull scenario for Peloton is them actually getting their bikes into more public spaces like gyms, hotels and office spaces. COVID created a lot of new Peloton owners who wanted to work out from home, but obviously, COVID is (hopefully) on its way out and those customers are returning to the real world. Would be great if they could take their Peloton login and jump on a bike anywhere they might normally work out, and it would really cement Peloton's place in the fitness world."
2021-04-19 14:41:13,stocks,"I knew peloton sold bikes and treadmills but i didnt know the exact details, just took a quick look and its C$2500 for the bike. Im not a cheap fucker and I would pay for quality but thats worth 5x more than a bike on amazon.

2021-04-19 14:59:43,stocks,"Im genuinely curious, what does a peloton have that other bikes lack? Forget about the video training sessions (cause you can use an ipad and pay 13 bucks a month to access them), im curious about the actual bikes themselves."
2021-04-19 16:37:17,stocks,"I've used one and it was pretty good.

I do feel like it's kinda like trying to understand an apple watch. Does it 100% make sense that it's more expensive than competitors? Maybe not. But you can't deny that it's the most silent bike you've ever heard, that the single resistance dial is a practical design, that there is a surprisingly high amount of value in the bike/software integration.

Tbh I think if I were designing the product I can't think of a single thing I'd change or add (besides price point!)-- that's pretty good. Their app isn't groundbreaking but it's pretty solid.

My tiny apartment complex was considering getting one. We already have a couple stationary bikes. Even if the peloton weren't 100% smoother I'd obviously choose it to track progress and all that.

And like the apple watch, sure you could have a fitbit + iphone + whatever lol. You could definitely buy the training videos, track your biking with another method (is it as accurate as measuring the output directly?), make graphs of your progress and share with friends manually. But there's a lot of value in having a great experience end to end."
2021-04-19 18:01:43,stocks,"Trawlin explained some of it. In addition to that, I think there's the branding that they do. They hype it up as a quasi status symbol. Their coaches seem to spend quite a lot of time on Instagram marketing the bike, the accessories (which also cost substantially more than many alternatives), and the lifestyle.  

It makes people feel like they're part of a community that projects fitness and status. I think a *somewhat* analogous example would be Equinox v. 24 Hour Fitness. Both are gyms, but one costs like 2-5x more per month than the other, yet there will still be people going to the expensive choice."

I don't love the valuation or think it's a must-buy stock. But after my personal experience I do think it's a reasonable company with a good product with the possibility of room to grow, if it somehow is able to grow or sustain its popularity. I do think it's more likely that the COVID growth will stagnate or go negative, but again-- reasonable company imo. Bikes are pricey as fuck but compared to some of these SPACs and tech companies at least the product is good."

I have already posted in last week‚Äôs Monday thread. I‚Äôm adding more info based on findings and hoping to get more feedback.

$MTTWF was originally founded in 1964 and has grown to operate across 26 countries. It was spun-off from $MTTRY in 2017 and the stock has been falling ever since.

$MTTWF shows stable revenue from wholesale (2017 - 2018 dip was because they stopped reporting the hypermarket department revenue, sold in 2020). The wholesaler dominates Germany and is growing in other countries.

It‚Äôs been trading side-ways with 5 P/E (yes, five) lately so I‚Äôve done some comparison between $MTTWF and $WMT. $WMT is financially doing 20x better than $MTTWF (possibly due to business model diversity + dominating the US market). However, the market cap of $WMT is almost 100x that of $MTTWF

Assuming $WMT is trading at fair value today, doesn‚Äôt this entail that $MTTWF is massively undervalued (20% - 30% of fair value)?

Position: I own 572 shares of METRO AG as of today, and got some spare cash incase of a dip

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Haven‚Äôt forgotten about this old dispute. Arbutus Biopharma ~ Moderna Dispute 

Arbutus Biopharma Corporation is a publicly-traded (NASDAQ: ABUS) biopharmaceutical company primarily dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing a cure for people with chronic hepatitis B virus (""HBV"") infection. We are advancing multiple drug product candidates that may be combined into a potentially curative regimen for chronic HBV infection. Arbutus has also initiated a drug discovery and development effort for treating coronaviruses (including COVID-19).  

On February 21, 2018, Moderna launched its own preemptive attack on Arbutus‚Äô patents, Moderna filed a petition for inter partes review (IPR) against Arbutus‚Äô U.S. Patent No. 9,404,127.  On March 5, 2018, Moderna filed another IPR against Arbutus‚Äô U.S. Patent No. 9,364,435.  And on January 9, 2019, Moderna filed a third IPR against Arbutus‚Äô U.S. Patent No. 8,058,069. the IPRs indicate that Moderna is seeking leverage in its negotiations with Arbutus. Presumably, Moderna believes that if it can invalidate two of Arbutus‚Äô patents, it can use those decisions to leverage further invalidity decisions against Arbutus‚Äô larger portfolio of LNP patents.  Alternatively, this threat alone is likely a means by Moderna to gain leverage in its licensing discussions with Arbutus, and to negotiate down the price for a license to Arbutus‚Äô patents.  

why did Moderna file these IPRs in the first instance?  Arbutus has not sued Moderna for patent infringement of any of the three patents challenged by Moderna.  Thus, Moderna‚Äôs choice to file the IPRs was not purely a defensive reaction to contain a lawsuit.  If that was the case, it would be harder to conclude that Moderna was particularly concerned that it was necessarily using Arbutus‚Äô LNP technology.  

Moderna previously licensed mRNA delivery technology using LNPs from a small Canadian company called Acuitas.  Acuitas had itself acquired a license to this technology from Arbutus.  Arbutus subsequently claimed that Acuitas‚Äô sublicense to Moderna was improper, and won a preliminary injunction in Canada against Acuitas‚Äô sublicense.  

On July 23, 2020, Arbutus prevailed in Moderna‚Äôs third IPR challenge to one of its patents, the ‚Äò069 patent.  Given that Moderna‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine candidate is currently one of the most promising, the question is, will Moderna‚Äôs vaccine infringe Arbutus‚Äô patents?  Arbutus will likely, at best, have a claim to a royalty.  For Arbutus to seek an injunction against Moderna‚Äôs vaccine, it would likely have to demonstrate it is also practicing the patent.  Even then, seeking an injunction from a court requires consideration of the public interest.

Most of the EV stocks that are tanking will likely not still be around in 30 years, but I do believe there are clear winners that will not only be around in 30 years but will be responsible for an amazing innovation in the industry.

2021-04-19 19:03:53,stocks,"10 billion pre-revenue is ridiculously hyped up and overpriced, but the situation right now is that most of these companies have dropped about 60% if not more from their hype levels. My most bullish EV stock, HYLN, is valued at 1.5 billion with 0 revenue. However they project 2 billion revenue 2024, which would make their current share price a damn steal, especially in a sector where prices typically tend to stay higher than reasonable.

Also in 10 years what will be considered fair value for companies today? Lots of these startups need years to ramp up production, reduce costs etc etc. After all those years, plus an extra few years, how much more money will be flowing into the market? Will a 10 billion market cap in 10 years be considered a penny stock?(exaggerating but I think I'm getting my point across.) Will 10 billion be the new 1 billion? 

By the time the winners in these early-stage companies are well underway in terms of products on the market and are up to scale, will the economy have grown as much as it did in the last decade? Where will the mega cap companies be valued at? I think that if it takes until 2025 for HYLN be earning money from their shares and earning revenue, then by 2025 they will still be valued higher than right now just due to economical growth in general.

Am I overestimating how fast the economy grows?"
2021-04-19 19:17:36,stocks,"It kind of has as many people consider under 5 or 10B small cap.  In 10 years at a very high 5% inflation 1 Billion will be 1.27Billion. Revenue growth and multiples have both expanded in the past decade and is why we saw 2 $Trillion companies quickly after first seeing $1trillion.

HYLN is honestly not bad at 1.5 Billion if they can generate that much revenue and have good margins at scale. Hopefully in 10 years it can be atleast 10x.

Nikola one point at 30B and QS at 12B to me are astounding. Examples of extremes for sure.

But they‚Äôre a very strong cash flow producing business, with an enormous R&D budget, and with the right leadership I could see them being in a better position in 2-5 years.

While I think the general negative feelings about INTC's losing ground to competitors is understandable, I feel like the reaction has been exaggerated on both ends of the spectrum, with INTC selling at multiples far below the industry average and competitors selling at multiples that are more speculative. The growth factor is important, though. If INTC is going to break upwards, they need to show strength on the income statement."
2021-04-19 12:38:16,stocks,"Definitely feel bullish on this one, there is such a huge requirement for chip fabrication right now and Intel is one of the 3 major companies on the fabrication side (Samsung & TSM). TSM is now running with fabrication for so many companies including Apple that I feel like their struggles to meet demand will only continue (Taiwanese drought is effecting production). Despite Intel's  woes in  consumers eyes their balance sheet is still excellent because they have diversified there product and are only investing more into building out there fabrication side. Their design and architecture brilliance for the desktop/laptop cpu's will come eventually, but in the mean time they can focus on winning in other ways. E.g. new factory openings, server cpu's etc."

Between Apple doing their own chips, ARM trying to squeeze in and Nvidia declaring they're going to start making CPU's and also AMD now focusing on the server chips (Which was Intel's bread and butter) this is starting to look like one of those: ""They owned the industry, how did they fail?"" scenarios."

2021-04-19 11:14:08,stocks,"Definitely long play. Intel is actually only a node behind (Intel's 7nm is close to TSM's 5nm). Their new CEO is an ex-Intel engineer, and them having their own fab is a plus in this weird time. AMD has the better chip right now, but TSM is at peak capacity and still have nowhere near enough chips to sell. I'm pretty bullish on INTC comeback. 

I'm not that concerned on Apple's ARM efforts either. Apple is squarely in their own lane, apart from some sentiment that those ARM chips are way more efficient, and they are. I think going forward, Apple's going on a way different path that both Intel and AMD shouldn't be worried (Apple is all about extremely tight integration but PC community is all about DIY and freedom)"

I entered a position in them back when they were trading in the high 40s back when everyone and their mothers grandmas cousin was trashing them. Even at $60.00 they are still pretty undervalued.
2021-04-19 13:14:49,stocks,"On last three quarters, they have reported financials that were above street's estimates, but took beatings (about 10% dip in average) in bad news on 7nm node (first 2 quarters) and not providing clarity on manufacturing on last quarter.

Good news in that they have no more bad news to report on 7nm node and they have provided clarity on manufacturing. They are expected to beat street's estimates this quarter since they have stated as much. Look for data center division's revenue and profit for how they are doing. Since this is cyclical, they may do well this quarter.

Notes: 

1. It seems AMD has diverted a lot of their chips manufacturing to data center products. Hence, unavailability of their desktop CPUs in retail market.
2. Intel's product pipeline is really good for 2021 with Alder Lake, new GPU and maybe Sapphire Lake."

2021-04-19 15:16:08,stocks,"The first thing you should understand about Intel before investing is that they're trading at a discount to their competitors for a very good reason. They threw in the towel on producing the most up-to-date chip (i5?) basically saying ""we missed the boat and we can't bring it back"".

The company is also going through some recent C-suite turnover, which is a big reason why the stock started sniffing the $60 range again in the latter half of 2020. 

If you're looking to invest, do yourself a favor and wait until after earnings at the very least. The trend of ""sell the news"" on ERs lately is rock-solid, and I don't think INTC is going to have any information in this upcoming ER that's going to pleasantly surprise the market. 

If you're betting on INTC right now, you're betting on a serious company turnaround. Not quite full-Blackberry mode, but close. Tread lightly. In my opinion, $60 is too high right now.

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Coinbase Deep Dive Diligence - Financial Overview & Valuation Hey All, below is some diligence on Coinbase. Would be great to crowdsource some thoughts as I never view my investment theses as impenetrable.¬†Almost all of the data I provide here comes from the company‚Äôs¬†[S-1 filing](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373?cik=1679788), website,¬†[latest Q1 2021 report](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788), and¬†[Meritech‚Äôs breakdown of Coinbase‚Äôs S-1.](https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/coinbase-ipo-s-1-breakdown#:~:text=Coinbase%2C%20the%20leading%20digital%20currency,their%20S%2D1%20last%20week.&text=The%20company%20is%20riding%20a,for%20when%20they%20start%20trading)

**Overview of Q1 2021 Results**

* I‚Äôve spread Coinbase‚Äôs key financial results and metrics over the past 9 quarters [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzNvBZZVoAgWzDW?format=png&name=large)¬†and all you really need to do is look at the last column to see the insane growth Coinbase has experienced in the past quarter
* To highlight a few of the most impressive stats from Q1 2021 alone:
   * **$1.8BN in revenue** \- 208% growth vs. Q4 2020 and almost equivalent to all of 2019-2020 revenue **combined**
   * **$1.1BN in EBITDA** (63% EBITDA margin) and **$765M in net income** (43% net income margin) - highly profitable business
   * $223BN assets held on Coinbase / $1.9TN crypto market cap = **11% market share (share has been¬†growing from 5% in 2019**
   * **56 million verified users -**¬†148% increase vs. Q4 2020
   * **6.1 million monthly transacting users** \- 118% increase vs. Q4 2020
* In short, Coinbase couldn‚Äôt have picked a better time to go public given its business is firing on all cylinders

[**S-1 Income statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=35)

* Already went through revenue, EBITDA, and net income above so won‚Äôt go into those numbers in this section and instead here are some interesting details about how Coinbase operates:
   * Only 5% of total revenue comes from¬†**institutional trading** vs. 90% from **retail** ([source](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg))
      * As you can see from this [chart](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc425026023788b31aa90_Retail%20vs%20Inst%20Trading%20Volume.jpg), institutional trading which is in orange is increasingly taking up a larger portion of trading activity, but since the fees are much less, institutions aren‚Äôt as big of a revenue driver for the company
   * As an investor, you also want to pay attention to Coinbase‚Äôs [subscription and services revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg) which is **growing quickly but only represents 4% of revenue**
      * These revenue streams are important because they aren‚Äôt as reliant on the volatile crypto market
   * Another key component of revenue you‚Äôll want to keep track of is **Coinbase‚Äôs fees** which is known to be one of the highest amongst all crypto exchanges. There is a [slight downward trend](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg) which may continue over time as competition intensifies
   * Something I personally find most impressive is that only **4% of revenue was spent on sales & marketing**. The company states that [90% of its retail users came through word of mouth](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&hl=450165:450601&hl_id=vkh5d_8u5) which just means customers are freely marketing for the company
* So in sum, Coinbase‚Äôs income statement looks really great but it‚Äôs important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly [if you look at the quarterly figures](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg)
   * The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase‚Äôs revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very¬†strong correlation between these two metrics
* This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at [this visual](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg). The blue bars here represent Coinbase‚Äôs operating income while the¬†orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all¬†over the place
* **Main takeaway:** Coinbase‚Äôs reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase

[**S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=38)

* Coinbase‚Äôs 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and¬†subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with **a little less than $3BN in free cash flow** which sounds pretty outstanding (but there‚Äôs a catch):
   * Custodial funds are basically **cash deposits customers are holding** on Coinbase‚Äôs platforms and the company is **restricted** form using this cash
   * This means that custodial funds actually **inflate** Coinbase‚Äôs cash from operations since it‚Äôs not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers
   * As a result, Coinbase‚Äôs cash from operations for 2020 is closer to **$300 million** and their free cash flow is¬†closer to **$285 million** which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above
* Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures
* Definitions in case it‚Äôs helpful:¬†
   * **Cash from operations** represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.
   * **Free cash flow** is the cash the company generates that they are ‚Äúfree‚Äù to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends

[**S-1 Balance Sheet Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=34)

* With **$1BN in cash and no¬†debt,** Coinbase is in a very solid position
   * Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that‚Äôs also balanced on the liability section
* Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the **crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings** which are interrelated and offset one another
* The last thing I want to mention is that **Coinbase‚Äôs PP&E is only $50 million**¬†which is tiny¬†compared to the company‚Äôs scale
   * Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage

**Coinbase Valuation**

* The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company‚Äôs results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I‚Äôll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations
* With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = **$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,**¬†which represents **464% year over year growth** vs. 2020
* Comparing against some of the [fastest growing software companies in the world](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png), no company comes close to Coinbase‚Äôs revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase‚Äôs revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year
* As a result, I think it‚Äôs fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company‚Äôs volatility and potential downside
   * 9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$250 / share**
   * 11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$313 / share**
* **Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase** with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction

**What I‚Äôm Doing**

* I‚Äôd be comfortable buying Coinbase at **$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (\~5% max)** as I think that it's a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been
   * I know there‚Äôs a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don‚Äôt see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can‚Äôt buy crypto in
* That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just **pure personal speculation**), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises

**TLDR:** In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company's volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn't blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I'm bullish on crypto in the long-run, I'm cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well."

I've recently started dabbling in Crypto and have found the different fees to be significantly more confusing than my traditional securities broker.

It seems even the no-fee options introduce 'spread' into prices to make a functional fee.

I'd rather just pay a fair commission on trades rather than get Nickle and Dimed on fees for depositing, withdrawing, spread, etc.

Bitcoin wallets already exist without a cost as far as I know, but the problem is buying the coin and getting it to the wallet.

Can I get a link to this fee-free competitor where I can finally ditch the horrible Coinbase fees without feeling like I need to be an IT professional to understand how it works? I assume it will be FDIC insured so that we don't have to worry about storing major amounts of money in there? If it's not launched yet, when it is supposed to launch?"

I think 1.5% (depends on transaction value) I‚Äôve already moved all my coins out of Coinbase. BlockFi pays 6% yield on BTC and LedgerX allows you to sell options and place limit orders. Coinbase is like the most basic retail fluff. They won‚Äôt keep any serious traders or institutions in my opinion. And then the Robin Hood type of traders still on their platform will leave, when other platform offer zero commission trades. IMO Coinbase knew exactly what they were doing, getting out at the peak. The only way the company goes up in value is BTC would have to run bullish exponentially. Like just keep breaking all time highs monthly."

This isn‚Äôt financial advice but.....When you buy stocks off FOMO and past returns, and then the stocks go down, the whole reason why you bought them has gone out the window. I think it would be wise to sell and put it into something more reasonable like VTI. 


Just remember, you‚Äôve learned your lesson, now don‚Äôt forget that lesson. When you buy a stock you actually have to have a reason on why you‚Äôre buying it and that reason should have nothing to do with past returns.

Euronav Sees Demand for Supertankers Rising As Oil Output Ramps Up -- Market Talk

April 16, 2021

Belgian tanker owner Euronav NV says that dozens of new supertankers must be deployed over the coming years as oil demand and production ramp up after the Covid-19 imposed restrictions give way. Oil production from OPEC members is expected to increase by up to four million barrels a day later this year and the US EIA expects oil demand to grow by 5.6 million barrels per day in 2021 and another 3.3 million next year, which implies consumption will be back to pre pandemic levels at above 100 million barrels per day in 2022. ""This would of course underpin a recovery in demand for tankers, potentially adding demand for 80 VLCCs on the Middle East-China route alone,"" Euronav said. Ship brokers say the extra production could push daily freight rates for very large crude carriers to more than $30,000 from around $8,000 now.

2021-04-19 10:54:03,stocks,"I learned my lesson during the Dotcom bubble.  I thought I was a ""F""-ing genius with QCOM and few others from 1998-2000 and all the Y2K hoopla.   In mid-late Jan, there was like a 10% drop -  ""I am a f-ing genius, rushed in to buy the dip""; by mid March-April, lost $300K and got out it.

It taught me a valuable lesson, **max out retirement accounts** with low cost mutual funds and **save 15% cash of yearly income** for emergencies, after that than **purchase blue chips names and reinvest dividends**.

Then and only then  develop a \~10 stock speculative portfolio that you did a lot of DD.  For me, more than 10 are difficult to keep current.

It also taught me to have a strategy on both the upside run and to manage downside risk (if any drops by \~15% I am out but will watch).  On the upside, I take profits at 25% and if its 50%, I sell 1/2 - 1/3 and let the remainder ride and not really tracking it. (Today those stocks include FB, BABA, CC, AMD, and LLY.)

So when the crash happen in 2008, I was well positioned and rode it out.  Retiring early and been enjoying the good life.

Today, I have a speculative portfolio to keep my mind active.

Good Luck.

PS:  I purchased my house right before the bubble at a fair price.  I am worried today that many people are getting over-extended by purchasing a home that they really cannot afford because of low interest rates."
2021-04-19 10:43:19,stocks,"In my opinion, the best approach to take is based on risk management. As markets become more and more overvalued, the upside potential goes down while the downside risk goes up. Also, the number of good investment opportunities goes down. As this happens your portfolio will naturally start to accumulate cash as you take profits from positions that no longer have a positive future outlook while it becomes harder to reinvest the proceeds. This reduces your exposure to the overvalued markets at the same time as they are at their riskiest. So by simply making smart investment decisions and not chasing returns you should have no need to time the markets."

2021-04-19 11:24:12,stocks,"I remember reading an article about a couple who had next to no capital, but who just got a loan of tens of millions of dollars and started buying and flipping entire apartment buildings. Again, with nothing but a loan from a bank. I was a teenager at the time with a fledgling interest in financial markets, but I remember thinking that this was a respected financial publication and here we are listening to this couple explaining how everyone else is an idiot for not getting a loan from their local bank and flipping apartment buildings, and the magazine I read it from was treating them like they were the smartest people they'd ever interviewed.

I remember people talking about how property was dirt cheap and that prices cannot go anywhere but up - and I'm not even from the U.S. This was a global phenomenon. I remember how TV had nothing but ads of banks pushing loans with fixed interest of only 4% - which in today's negative interest world probably seems ludicrous, but where I'm from, banks stress test your mortgage viability by calculating an interest rate of 6% even today. Also, for a short time, banks were allowed to give out mortgages of like 60 years, and I remember a friend of mine telling me about this couple who worked at the same factory as he did, and they both made minimum wage and still managed to get a mortgage of 1 million euros for 60 years. 

Two months later the factory closed down, I don't know what happened to the couple, but you can't get a mortgage of 60 years here anymore. Law prohibits it.

I was actually very vocal about my skepticism of the whole thing. Not only did the dumbest people in my social circles dish out investment advice, but newspapers and magazines and other publications celebrated the people who took insane risk that they clearly didn't understand. Like ""interest rates can't go up"" (technically they were right), and ""I'm worth 10 million on paper"" - no, they weren't. They had 10 million in liabilities and a slight change in either the property price or the interest rate will mean you'll be liquidating all of your assets. A lot of these people couldn't perform basic percentage calculations - like they couldn't understand why you'd still be in the red if a stock price went down 10% today and rose 10% tomorrow, but they were still being hailed as the people who were proof that Warren Buffett didn't know anything about how to make money in this new world.

I see a lot of that today, again. It's more of a gut feeling: The wrong people are telling you what you should put your money into. I can't predict when it's going to happen, but last time I told people that it was going to happen before 2010. It was a guess back then, and while I was right about it, it was for the wrong reasons so I can't pat myself on the back for it. 

But yeah, people will be really wide-eyed and tell you that everything is better than ever and that a crash cannot happen ever again because everything is so great. Things are so fantastic, that even complete morons are making a killing, so how could anything be wrong? 

How indeed."

[Here is an article from January 2021](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/lcd-monthly-assessing-the-us-loan-market-one-year-after-the-covid-19-crash) that explains the issue and warns about what might happen.  Helpful snippets from the article:

""The primary market too is awash with cash, allowing high-yield and leveraged loan borrowers to tap funding at cheap rates, despite falling revenues due to COVID-19. As one buyside account said this week: 'Some companies are worse off than a year ago, and they are borrowing money at cheaper rates than ever.' 'It feels like we are back to pre-crisis levels almost, and the default rate has not really spiked, even though everyone knows Q1 is a write-off in terms of normal business activity,' said another buyside manager this week. 'Some companies, especially in the leisure and retail sectors, just see their leverage multiples rising and rising, but as long as they have liquidity, no one seems to care. You would think that sooner or later this could catch up with us.' ... Restructuring advisers agree that unlike in past crises, liquidity will be the main driver of defaults. But there is indeed a risk that the current accumulation of debt due to cheap rates could come back and bite both borrowers and investors. 'High-yield sometimes used to be 10%-plus, but with non-investment-grade spreads as low as they are, pressure from interest payments is not what it once was. However, following the COVID-19 recession, liquidity shortfalls stemming from businesses ramping up to pre-crisis levels of activity will be a major driver of default rates going forward,' said Joseph Swanson, co-head of Houlihan Lokey's EMEA Restructuring Group.' ""

Think about the scene in The Big Short where the stripper tells Mark Baum (played by Steve Carell) that she owns three homes that she should not have qualified for because she got them at low interest rates.  She then realizes that if those interest rates shift, she's in trouble.  That is the point where Mark Baum (in the movie) realizes the housing market bubble is real and it is going to burst.  Now replace the stripper with businesses that have not had any real income over the past year (""zombie companies"").  They have been limping along, hoping to survive the COVID-19 crisis, and low interest loans have helped them do that, but what happens if anything shifts?  Boom.  The companies fail and default on their loans, and people lose their jobs.  Those people who lost their jobs might have bought homes during the crisis too, so they now default on their mortgages as people desperate to sell flood the housing market with inventory, decreasing the average home price.  Boom.  Other people who bought homes they could afford, albeit at a premium, are now super under water on THEIR mortgages.  The ripples from the collapse of those zombie companies also creates a lot of extra talent competing for the ""survivors'"" jobs, which may deflate wages, meaning it is harder for people to afford those giant mortgages, leading to more potential defaults.  Boom.

2021-04-19 15:44:17,stocks,"Tangentially related, but if you go back and look at contemporary cultural artifacts from ~2006-2008, the idea that the mortgage market was a bubble was EVERYWHERE. In retrospect, it‚Äôs shocking more people DIDN‚ÄôT see it coming. 

For example, I saw a JibJab flash cartoon (lol if anyone else remembers JibJab) I think a parody song about Bush winning a second term, and one of the lines is like ‚ÄúI hope the mortgage bubble doesn‚Äôt collapse in my second term!‚Äù There were also plenty of like sketch comedy skits or sitcom throwaway gags that referenced it, not to mention all the ‚Äòhouse flipping‚Äô reality tv shows (referenced in the big short). 

It seems to me there was a very common perception that the housing market was going crazy. We seem to have memory-holed that and have somehow retrospectively decided that no-one saw it coming. The more interesting thing is why so few people made bets on it / banks continued the MBS party. And i think it‚Äôs literally just because they were getting paid on keeping it going...and perhaps some knew full well it would come down eventually but thought they could get out before it went down, or didnt understand how bad and how big it had got.

2021-04-19 18:19:07,stocks,"I'm old enough to have seen several major downturns '74, '00, and '08 come to mind.  Here's my take.  Everybody saw it coming,  and nobody saw it coming.  In order
1. '74 Nixon resigned and out of control inflation with Arab oil embargo.  Prime interest rate 20%. 
2. '00 Internet bubble
3. '08 mortgage meltdown with housing price collapse. 

In '96 FRB chairman Alan Greenspan coined the phrase ""irrational exuberance"". He was too early for the internet bubble.  By '99 you could throw $ at a stock that said "". Com"" and make a fortune. Mark Cuban prime example,  started a company sold for a billion at just the right time.  
Then with the y2k potential problem the FRB pumped out $zillions into the money supply.  After y2k wasn't an actual issue they tried to take it back out . At the same time people realized that companies that said "". Com"" and had no earnings,  no revenue, no actual productive employees weren't worth a shit load of money and sold.  Result:  economy in the shitter followed by 9-11 next year. 

In the early '00s Barney Frank wanted everybody to have a house.  Sub-prime lending was born.  A mortgage lender friend told me a borrower only needed one of credit history,  capacity to repay, collateral value, character, and conditions to get a mortgage . 5 c's of credit.  Bankers learn those in elementary school. Houses were built that were crap.  People could barely make the payment , ect. Loans were usually 5 year with a balloon 30 year amortization.  When 5 years were up rates go up borrower couldn't pay, house forclosed. But when it happens to half the houses on the street, prices go down.  World burns.  We are now in a house we bought for peanuts. Couple bought it for about $250 k cash out refi and owed $350. Price collapsed to $275 wife left him. They gave it back to the bank.  We got it for $ 200, now valued at $600.

That is a synopsis, I could write a book.  

Fast forward to now. It feels to me like '00 again.  The electronic ""money"" that you can't say in this sub being the internet stock now.  That may work long term, it may work now. I don't know.  Other issues are the  covid,  Gamestop, all the indices at all time highs and home prices at crazy levels. One thing to remember is life is short but also life is long.  If you are young, your investment time horizon is measured, not in days , months,  or years,  but in decades. Stocks ALWAYS rise decade over decade. Buffett didn't start out a billionaire.

I hope this helps. Good luck."
2021-04-19 12:24:38,stocks,"I've said this before and I'll say it again: Contrary to common wisdom, it's actually easy to spot bubbles, almost impossible to time them, and also difficult to find the financial instrument that allows you to make money on them.

For me, it was increasingly obvious when house shopping in 2005 that prices were out of whack. When they kept going up throughout 2006 in my area (in other areas they already peaked) I bought a small position of SRS (ultra short REIT) in Nov 2006, thinking this was  the play.

The stock market continued to go up, even after the subprime crisis in Feb 2007, signs of contagion Aug 2007, and peaked in Oct 2007. Market only started to really slam down fall of 2008.

The short REIT wasn't an ideal instrument. Shorting financials would have been better for the sophisticated non-professional investor. The only ones that made serious bank were the people in the Big Short shorting CDOs.

In 2020 (and even now), the SPAC frenzy was a pretty obvious bubble. However, how would you bet against it? Outright shorting was risky due to margin calls, not to mention borrowing costs and hard to borrow. Puts were god awful expensive -- you had to time it perfectly to make money, which is impossible.

I can give you a handful of tickers I have high confidence they will be cut into at least half in 5 years. But you can't really make that bet."
2021-04-19 12:57:31,stocks,"It was like a game of musical chairs. Everybody, and I mean everybody knew the music would stop eventually, but everyone kept playing, hoping to be the one that would up with a chair. Even in a beginners economics history class in Vienna, Austria I took in early 07 the prof was talking about how the excessive lending in the US will cause the market to collapse soon. But the actual event and particularly the size and the actual consequences ( suddenly banks wouldn‚Äôt loan each other money and business couldn‚Äôt get even the most basic of loans.) surprised a lot of people. Including me. I lost a good  amount of money in some very safe ETFs early in my forays into investing.

There were stories of people buying a house with no money down, taking the gained equity and buying another house. There were seminars in every city teaching how to buy property and flip it, buy apartment buildings, etc. It was scary to think of people extending themselves and the banks were letting everyone get a mortgage without an income, job, down payment, etc. The frenzy ran up housing prices. So it was coming. It was looked at as a prosperous time. People were happy that they owned a house and had a job. And then they didn't.

But the timing of it all was not predictable. Just one day...and there it was. Within a few day most peoples portfolios lost half."
2021-04-19 15:16:22,stocks,"I remember at the time I noticed irrational exuberance. EVERYONE was investing, buying new homes, rental properties, taking equity out of their houses multiple times a year(i.e. over leveraging themselves). It seemed as though everything the average person touched turned to gold. All of the financial institutions kept telling us everything was great and to keep spending. I played it safe and refrained from doing any of the above mentioned things, only to have the equity from my home stolen to bail out the banks. Last year I made the comment to a friend that this feels like 2008 all over again, the difference (that I see) is that regulations have made it impossible for the banks to abuse mortgage securities so now they are doing it with stocks, bonds, and precious metals. I believe that the market is going to implode and I know this community will have saved many households from taking the same hit they did in '08."
2021-04-19 10:17:04,stocks,"in 2003 i started looking to buy a home, and was shocked at the prices of the houses.

I saw people that had no credit or money to put down buying houses for 500k+, it all seemed like lunacy.  Point is, there were markers available to the average person a good 5 years before things finally shit the bed.  You cant time it, and when it looks crazy, it can easily have YEARS left in the tank.  Tread careful, wisely, but not too fearfully."
2021-04-19 15:39:02,stocks,My boss at the time said he was going to take all his money out of the market about 6 months before the crash. I don't know if he did or not. I can tell you I was house shopping at the time and the prices were so ridiculous I knew something was up. Glad I trusted my gut and didn't buy because I was laid off 1 yr later.
2021-04-19 13:01:25,stocks,"I was caught by some surprise but the crash didn't happen that fast cuz the bottom hit in 2009.  There still was lots of time to productively spend my invest-able cash. Always keep a list of great companies you want on sale so you know what you need to buy when the opportunity strikes. Also have a plan getting cash into your portfolio regularly. 

Ask Shakespeare says too early can be as bad as too late. So don't worry too much about timing. 

(That said, there's almost always a bear market somewhere and therefore a good deal to be had no matter the timing)"

2021-04-19 12:41:24,stocks,"For the dot com crash it was chance to an extent but I ‚Äútimed‚Äù it. I knew everything was going to come crashing down and had options vesting in October I think it was. They vested at the peak and I got out just in time. The daily gains/losses right at the end were giving me serious heartburn and anxiety. If I didn‚Äôt have options vesting at that point in time, I would have failed to time it I am sure.

For the 2008 crash I knew things were crashing because I worked in mortgage at the time (management) and saw all the last ditch efforts going on to shore things up. I didn‚Äôt know how bad it would get though. I also didn‚Äôt do anything about it. Time in the market vs timing the market and all that. I really wish I would have taken advantage of some of the real estate deals after the crash though.

Personally, I think we are a bit frothy right now and see similar signs. Too much money is causing housing to go nuts like it was prior to 2008 and valuations are crazy like the dot com area or feels that way anyhow. I am no expert. No idea when this ride will end though and think we have more runway as covid, presumably, ends. I am bullish through the end of the year. Maybe, who really knows. It is sort of irrelevant as am not going to do anything about my opinion on where we are at right now.

2021-04-19 15:50:19,stocks,"I'll answer this in a different way - after the crash, REITs and Real Estate stocks were badly beaten up but you could buy some of them with 10-20% yields, which NEVER cut their distributions. 

I worked in investment banking covering this industry and most of the people were too cautious to recommend buying at that time. The thing is - it was a crisis of liquidity (access to debt) not a crisis of fundamentals. To be a buyer at that time, you'd have to have predicted that the Fed would bail out the banks and open up the spigot. 

Some investors, however, waded in and made huge returns. I know two guys in the industry who looked at General Growth Properties - which had its share price hammered to $0.30 or so - who loaded up. One guy put over a million dollars into it and sold out when it hit $13.00 if I recall. He retired. The other guy bought a giant old Victorian house and gut renovated it."
2021-04-19 16:15:24,stocks,"I saw it coming, just way way too early. That's been my issue with this market too. I went bearish in 2018. It cost me a ton (albeit with some return last march). So timing is key. I think if you look at the fed's moves and the effect (or lack there of) they have on the bond market, you can predict the next crash. A crash in junk bonds always preceded a strong market downturn, and I'm willing to bet we're near one, just not sure how near. Also, the fed is delaying that with their direct purchases of fixed income securities (which in my opinion, is ILLEGAL), but the more desperate they seem to buy, the closer we'll get to a crash.
Don't listen to what everyone is touting btw... The market is not priced correctly. It's rising because people cannot put their money in anything what, as it's earning nothing. These PEs are reminiscent of 1999!!!"
2021-04-19 10:29:54,stocks,"No, that was the craziest event I‚Äôve ever seen financially."
2021-04-19 15:44:03,stocks,"Sort of, yes.  But I didn't see it crossing all sectors.  

I saw real estate being insanely valued and transacted.  Everywhere you turned, amateurs were bragging about being financial geniuses because their house value appreciated.  Everyone that owned a house was trying to use the equity to buy second and third houses, and clucking about how other people would pay their mortgages for them.  Mortgage approvals were a joke.  No down payment, no appraisals, 30 year terms, low rates.  NINJA loans everywhere.  

Everyone, and I do mean everyone, was talking real estate and income property 24x7.  Listings, bidding wars, tactics for winning bids, finding non-public listings, etc.

The most vivid example was a guy we knew who was a nice guy but essentially unemployable. No skills, education, or personal discipline.  Basically a video game addict.

He somehow ""bought"" a pre-construction condo on the strength of what he predicted his income could be if he became a freelance graphic artist and managed to find clients.  

The value of the not-yet-built condo started to rise well above his contracted price.   That difference was considered his equity, and he leveraged that into buying two more pre-construction condos.  His stated plan was that the profits from flipping one condo would pay for his personal condo, and the profits from the other condo would set him up for instant retirement.  It sounds silly today, but at the time, anyone talking like that was just considered normal daily conservation.  (Kind of like how we've heard people since talk about their Apple or Tesla or Ark or GME or krypt-o.)

One condo (his) got finished, and the other two got sucked into the vortex.  He got lucky (if you will) because we were monitoring and nagging him early and often which helped him bail out much earlier than otherwise.  He was still stuck with the personal condo, but had to take on multiple food delivery gigs and his life was spent delivering pizzas and doing car repairs.  

Seeing a non-employed person owning three condos and claiming he was more than halfway to being a ""self made"" millionaire was the capper for me.  We went into a defensive real estate posture, modest house, limited debt.  But lots of investing into other aggressive sectors, which didn't work out that well.  I knew real estate would get smoked but I didn't expect it to hit everything."

Hate to be a na√Øve optimist but I have to ask myself, what if this is actually the market floor? With some of the worst fundamentals (ehem literal global economic lockdown) the central banks were able to prop us up at these levels. If the CBs never really plan to unwind the balance sheets, which they can easily keep rolling forward, we might not be headed for a calamity. Plus who cares how big the balance sheet is as long as it doesn't cause rampant inflation, I know groceries and housing is up bigly but I don't think there's incontrollable inflation yet (or if there will be??). I just feel like people have been saying the stock market would crash since 2009 (at the literal bottom, people were calling for The End of Capitalism) and on top of that it seems like everyone thinks a big bull market is imminent, which is often a sign there isn't one coming. The 2020s might be the most innovative decade in the history of humanity due synergies kicking in (accelerated by covid). Furthermore, billions of people are being raised out of poverty as we speak. The only missing ingredient for an insane economy is productivity growth, new technologies may kick that into high gear."

2021-04-19 14:25:38,stocks,"I don't remember if it was common knowledge that the mortgages were being bundled and sold to investors as bonds. 

I think that was a big driver of the no verification mortgages. Huge investor demand"
2021-04-19 17:27:20,stocks,"That's because the securities which included subprime mortgages, in theory, should have been just fine even if the subprime borrowers defaulted.  There's still plenty of income from the senior (investment grade) tranches, and what's more, if a borrower defaults then the lender can foreclose and flip the house.  Everything still seemed safe, and Bernanke famously remarked in 2007 that the subprime crisis had been contained.

What nobody expected was that housing prices would cease to go up.  Housing prices had always gone up... it's brick and mortar and that's a valuable asset anyway you look at it.  Unless, of course, supply of houses drastically exceeds demand.  Subprime borrowers defaulting put a lot of houses back on the market at once (more supply).

Furthermore, investor confidence was shaken by the subprime crisis so there's a credit crunch... this means borrowing gets more expensive.  Interest rates rise.  This means less eligible buyers, and less people willing to speculate on houses with easy money (less demand).

Then there's the problem of adjustable-rate mortgages.  Borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages suddenly get hit with rates that they can't possibly afford.  In the past, this wasn't a problem, because housing prices always go up, right?  They could just refinance using the new value of their home.  But faced with falling home prices, they couldn't anymore.  This results in more foreclosures.  Even more houses on the market, less eligible buyers.  The crisis spreads.

Now banks holding ridiculous amounts of these ""safe"", AAA mortgage-backed securities, using ridiculous amounts of leverage, are in real trouble.  Their mortgage-backed securities are no longer worth anything.  They can't pay what they owe.  They go bankrupt (Lehman Brothers), unless bailed out by the government (Bear Stearns).

People thought that subprime wasn't a big deal, because it was only about 20% of the market. In a way, they were right.  In and of itself, those subprime defaults didn't mean much.  What they didn't count on was how subprime defaults could cause the whole house of cards to come toppling down."

That said, I think most reddit investors have been more ""risk-on"" than just holding broad index funds, and they might benefit from stopping to consider the valuations of the kind of stocks they hold. In particular, if someone is invested in leveraged funds, LEAPs, and/or speculative growth companies, they might want to consider ""timing the market,"" by shifting to a less leveraged/risky portfolio.

I agree that nobody can call the top with perfect accuracy except by dumb luck, *but* it is possible for a somewhat active investor to recognize when valuations are too high/low and shift between a more risk-on/-off portfolio."

I also have IPOE - because I really like their target SoFi, not the mgmt team.

I also took a position in Tuscan Holdings Corp B as a pure momentum play as merger has been announced but it approached NAV.   They have a shareholder vote on April 28 - if I hold past the merger their would have to be significant news.

I also like CC as a momentum play - With both SHW and PPG reporting good quarters and the boom in housing starts, I noticed both has nice upticks this week. With CC being the world largest TiO2 supplier (basic pigment in paint, plasters, caulks) , I am thinking that they will have a similar pop when they report on May 3. (I already hold CC)

Yeah, at the end of the day the market is the sum of the individual companies the make it up. So if you want to know where the market is you just have to look at the valuations of the underlying companies.

If you see crazy valuations time and time again, then it usually means it's time to be patient and wait it out in cash or other safe assets."

Early 2000s people were still learning about the internet and the possibility of exchange of information. Free wasn't exactly a term that mainstream society adopted and a lot of skepticism on information found online. 

Stock market was really at the time still not opened that much to the public. And most would likely put it in securities and ETFs like a savings account. College and university students unless they were really interested or in need of money would highly unlikely want to try to access and enter the stock market with low funding accounts especially when each trade would have been charged with costs. No free meals unfortunately. 

A lot of generalization since it's hard to pin point everyone's story. So do take what I say with a grain of salt since not everyone will make the same observations."

2021-04-19 18:57:45,stocks,"Yep. Early investors should really trust in long term DCA. The only way that theory doesnt work is if we head into Nuclear war.

Dollar cost averaging takes the emotion out of investing and you aren't trying to time gains and dips. You honestly shouldn't even care what the price is. You should only care how many shares you were able to buy over 30 years. You'll buy some of those at the highest of highs and at the lowest of lows. The point is that you bought them in both cases, equally. And you didn't try to time the market and discriminate or adjust your monthly contributions based on ""fears"" you heard somewhere.

Contribute monthly. Don't miss a month, whether the market is red or green. And I don't care how long it's been red or green for. Contribute every single month. You'll thank me in 30 years. 

DCA is how you take emotion out of it."

I wouldn't know where to start in terms of calculating a reasonable price estimate for a bank as complicated as CS, but it sounds like an obvious discount buying opportunity.

Their assets:equity ratio is about 19 (just from looking at their balance sheet), which is higher than famous American banks, but not out of line for international banks (compare e.g., RBC or BNP).  Their [tier 1 leverage ratio](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/investor-relations/corporate-and-share-information/corporate-information/key-metrics-tables.html) is also not out of the ordinary (around 6%).

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Learnings from Mohnish Pabrai's Q&A Session with Indiana University  Here are the learnings from Mohnish Pabrai latest Q&A

## Finding investment opportunities and when to dig deeper

As  there are more than 100,000 stocks in the world, one needs a system to  eliminate large quantities of companies in less than a few seconds or  minutes. Mohnish uses Warren Buffett‚Äôs method and asks ‚Äú**Is the business in my circle of competence?**‚Äù.  This would eliminate most of the companies. Adding industries that he  doesn‚Äôt have an interest in, like US Healthcare or defense contractors,  there are suddenly fewer opportunities available. A lot of tech names  tend to be high-flyers and lose him on valuation. A company similar to  Snowflake would take him just around 15 seconds to move on.

One idea finding generator is Value Investors Club,  where investors have made thousands of write-ups to create ideas. Since  there are harsh restrictions on who can post they provide a good way to  hunt and learn. Many of the write-ups and comments are very insightful.  Value Line (Note: Many libraries have an online *Value Line* subscriptions, and some even allow Non-US residents to acquire an online card) and SumZero  (Note:quite expensive) are other idea generating sources. Additionally  he receives emails that contain investment ideas. Going through all  those, some of the companies stick out and he spends more time with  them. The objective is to quickly eliminate them. Saying no in 15  seconds is great, a minute is good. **To become a good investor one needs to be good at saying no**. The investment idea should be so compelling to convince a very deep skeptic, then one can dig deeper into the company.¬†

Looking  through the filings can give great insight into a business. Management  over- or under-delivering on their promises made five to ten years ago,  gives invaluable understanding of the company. It is a mixture of a  treasure hunt and a jigsaw puzzle. You have pieces and ideas on why a  company looks interesting looking for evidence that confirms and denies  that. He often looks at flimsy reasons to stop doing his research.¬†

There are times where he looks at a company for three days and then finds a reason to move on. **As  you learn a lot about the industry and the company one shouldn‚Äôt be  discouraged to discard an idea, even if it took long to research.**

&#x200B;

## Circle of competence and diversification

**One should never compromise the circle of competence in the name of diversification**.  Most entrepreneurs like Sam Walton (founder of Walmart) aren‚Äôt  diversified for their whole lives and aren‚Äôt plagued by sleepless  nights. Charlie Munger‚Äôs friend John Arillaga only invests in a two mile  radius close to the Sanford campus, yet he is a billionaire. His circle  of competence is restricted to real estate in a specific geography, but  that doesn‚Äôt stop him from doing well. If you only understand a single  industry, and your competence is solid, a focus on two or three stocks  is enough. Don‚Äôt compromise to become diversified.¬†

As he handles  other people's money he never puts more than 10% into one position and  he is historically unwilling to cut positions back. After a big run up,  there were times where two stocks made over 70% of the portfolio.  Mohnish doesn‚Äôt like to cut the flowers and water the weeds (originally  coined by Peter Lynch). Instead of cutting positions in the name of  ‚Äúrisk management‚Äù he carefully looks at the business and what makes most  sense in this situation.¬†

In his personal portfolio he is even  more concentrated, hardly ever having more than three stocks and  sometimes only one. There are not many ideas that you understand and are  priced well.¬†

Many would lose sleep being as concentrated as he is. **An investor needs to do what gives him comfort,yet maximizes the potential returns**.¬†

 

## Knowing where to draw the edges of your circle

**To ask the question is to answer it**.  If you ask yourself if it is in your circle of competence, or chances  are high it isn‚Äôt, if you have to question your business valuation it is  outside of your circle of competence. If you are competent, valuation  and the soundness of the business will be very apparent. Staying dead  center in your circle of competence is important. As there is no clear  boundary between confidence and incompetence, as you get closer to the  edges your risk factor increases. Mohnish says he doesn‚Äôt understand 99%  of all stocks, you just need to understand a few things well.¬†

 

## Expanding the circle of competence

In his book, he had to  research the shipping industry in order to make an investment. He was  intrigued by the industry as it isn‚Äôt very complicated. He was  especially interested in large crude carriers and started to read about  the industry and companies inside it. **To grasp how the industry functions, he used a mental model from an industry he already knew**.  In commercial real estate building office towers take around 4-6 years  to build. When the market is tight and rents are rising, lots of  projects are started at a similar time. As the towers get ready at the  same time it causes an oversupply, creating a boom and bust circle. The  same happens to large crude carriers, but on steroids. There are only a  few places that built them and it takes at least three years to deliver  them. Understanding the dynamics on how daily rates are determined and  how you couldn‚Äôt instantly expand the fleet was important. Learning  about different industries and businesses is always interesting, if you  can get a deep enough understanding to make an investment is another  question. One needs to learn enough to understand the dynamics of both  the industry and the business.¬†

Mohnish at the time was looking at  Frontline, one of the largest crude carrier operators in the world. As  100% of their fleet was on the spot market the dynamic of widely  fluctuating daily shipping rates (sometimes in the order of 50:1),  greatly influenced the company. After the Exxon Valdez there were a new  set of regulations that all new ships need to be double hulled. Ships  that were built before that were single hulled and were rented out for  lower rates. As the demand for oil went down, rates collapsed and the  delta between single and double hulls disappeared. This resulted in the  ship operators scraping the old ships. If inevitably oil demand rises  again, rates fluctuate more widely than the price of bitcoin, going from  $10,000 to $200,000 in a matter of just three weeks. Looking at the  business and the fleet, he knew that the liquidation value in a fire  sale was around $8 a share, while the stock was $5. He invested 10% of  the fund and in just a few months it went up to $11. Patting himself on  the back, he exited the position. As he looked at the company one year  latter the price was at $150. He missed the ride, because the market  went from fear to euphoria, while his thesis was just not losing money. **Being savvy about euphoria and greed is important in investing** and often having a small position to capture that pop at the other end can be beneficial.¬†

&#x200B;

## Emerging and Efficient markets

Efficiency doesn‚Äôt depend if  the market is developed, emerging or declining. There are, were and will  be times where the US market is extremely inefficient. As today‚Äôs  inefficiencies of the US market are on the side of being overvalued, he  looks in different corners on the globe. Today there are very few  undervalued names that have the significant discounts he looks for.  Mohnish wants to buy something that is worth $10 and selling for $4.  Different countries are at different points of the inefficiency circle.  Taking advantage of those cycles and markets outside of the US can be a  huge advantage for an investor.¬†

&#x200B;

## On Shorting

While mathematically it looks nice to reduce  potential returns in a falling market and create alpha, there are very  few who can do it well. As the Forbes 400 is dominated by people who are  long only and non-diversified like the Walton family, Bill Gates or  Jeff Bezos, Mohnish isn‚Äôt interested in shorting.¬†

To be good at  shorting, one has to be competent as risk management. If one shorts  Tesla at $50 dollars, you need to cut your position by 10% if it rises  to $100 and if it goes down, you need to increase your short position -  else you risk losing too much. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger had  short candidates and were right on the company, but often horribly wrong  about the timing. **Since you need to get both timing and the business correct it is much easier to make money on the long side**.  When you have a short position you always need to know what the market  does. As Mohnish has no leverage and no short positions it is irrelevant  what happens today, tomorrow or even next month to the share price of  the company. The only thing he has to worry about is if the company gets  better each year.¬†

 

## How long to hold a stock?

In a book from 1972 ‚Äú100 to 1 in  the Stock Market‚Äù by Thomas Phelps there was a sentence that said that  every sell decision you make is to acknowledge an investing mistake. In a  Utopia you would only hold investments that compound over decades at a  good rate. Those companies do exist and while it is easy to find them in  hindsight it is very hard to find them at the starting staging of the  compound curve.¬†

As 2020 was a year of learning for him, he had a  change in his thinking. Whereas before he tried to find dollar bills for  50 cents he now tries to find those compounders. Managing those 50 cent  stocks is tax inefficient and requires a treadmill of activity. He now  looks at the destination of the business in 10-20 years. Finding  compounders that the world hasn‚Äôt figured out yet is the holy grail of  investing.¬†

&#x200B;

## Checklist for companies that are great

Mohnish had Dinner  with Charlie Munger a week ago and he is doing well. Charlie often talks  about cinches (as a non-native speaker I had to look up what the hell a  cinch is: basically an easy and certain thing). So a company isn‚Äôt a  cinch when the odds are high that something destroys the company. When  Charlie says something is a cinch he know he has to back up the truck  and life will be good. Charlie Munger would probably say that Costco is a  cinch. It is hard to imagine forces that destroy Costco, to the  contrary it becomes more valuable the more stores they open. **Capitalism  is brutal, 98% of all companies go bankrupt in less than 10 years and  even the fortune 500 don‚Äôt last more than a few decades**. Just  like in nature at the end almost all of them die. While it seems like a  fool‚Äôs errand to find the exception to those inherent traits it is the  path to the promised land.

Ten years ago a friend of his analyzed  American Towers and showed up early to an analyst meeting. As he went to  the office of the CFO, he saw that the CFO was relaxing and had nothing  to do. After questioning if he had nothing to do, he answered that  everyone who wants to sell a cell phone tower has our number and we  already know what we will pay, we just have to sit and wait to acquire  it. **So if the CFO has the luxury of having his feet on the desk it is a kick-ass business**. Most businesses can‚Äôt even think to run that way and would go bankrupt in less than three month.¬†

In  the future he only wants to have cinches and ‚Äúfeet on the desk‚Äù  businesses in his portfolio. According to him, his current portfolio  only has two of those companies. As time progresses he wants to replace  his 50cent ideas with awesome companies.

The third question concerns the destination of the business. Costco  just entered China and they had to put up restrictions as the store got  mobbed. In 20 years there is the probability that there are many stores  in China and since there are more than 170 countries where Costco has no  presence, there is enough room to grow. If the DNA of the company  remains intact it looks like a cinch in 2021.¬†

His investment  checklist is a living and breathing document and he just recently added  those three to the moat section. He has a lot of other factors but he  won‚Äôt all list them.

* Is it a cinch?
* Is it a ‚Äúfeet on the desk‚Äù business?
* Where is the destination?

However  it is not difficult to come up with a good checklist. He looked at how  great investors lost money and if there were things to know before the  investment was made, that could have prevented you from doing so. Warren  Buffett‚Äôs investment in Dexter Shoes turned sour as they got decimated  by cheap overseas labor. So he added it to his checklist:¬†

* Is this a business that can be negatively impacted by cheap overseas labor?

 

## Valuing a business

Mohnish wants to have the cake and eat it  too. Great businesses rarely are cheap, but he still aims to buy Costco  at 3 times earnings. At the moment it is at 36 P/E, which is not bad for  a kick-ass business, but as it goes into the lower double digit range  he passes most investments.

In order to value a business one has  to take many scenarios into account. Costco has a range of future  stores, membership and profitability per store. Getting these numbers  and backtracking from there get you to a reasonable price to pay for the  company. Depending on the business and the circumstances regarding the  nature of the business one has to take different scenarios into account.  Mohnish isn‚Äôt a fan of DCF. **If you need Excel to value a business it is probably too difficult**.  In an older talk he outlines 10 commandments of investing and one of  those was ‚ÄúThou shall not use Excel‚Äù. If Costco would sell at 9 times  earnings, one doesn‚Äôt need Excel to know it‚Äôs a great deal.¬†

I collected the ten commandments:¬†

* Thou shall not have an investment team (hard to have a good working relationship with an analyst)¬†
* Thou shall accept I shall be wrong one-third of the time
* Thou shall look for hidden 1x price-earnings stocks (based on future or hidden earnings and not shown by any screen)
* Thou shall never use Excel
* Thou shall always have a rope to climb out of the deepest well (setbacks are part of the course, learn to deal with them
* Thou shall be singularly focused (Focus on the company, not the macro
* Thou shall never short (Unlimited downside, only 100% upside)
* Thou shall not be leveraged.
* Thou shall be a shameless cloner (look for ideas from great investors, VIC‚Ä¶)
* Thou  shall not skim off the top (Investment Managers should only make money  when they create returns -¬† similar to old Buffer/Munger Partnerships)¬†

## Setbacks in investing

If wealth is lost - nothing is lost, if  health is lost - something is lost and if character is lost -¬†  everything is lost. It is in the nature of investing that at least four  out of ten ideas don‚Äôt work out as you expected. Predicting the future  is hard. Nobody predicted the pandemic and even less how stock prices  would look like after a year. **The way the future unfolds is often different than one‚Äôs logic dictates.**¬†

Mohnish  had several zeroes. A mortgage company in 2007, a zinc recycler and  countless picks that went flat or declined somewhat. One must have the  discipline and the process to still continue and learn from those  setbacks.¬†

 

## Most important trait for investors

While there are many  things that are important, extreme patience is required to do well.  Business changes happen not in minutes or days, they take years. **If you love to see paint dry one is suited to be an investor**. Doing nothing and being in bliss is a great trait to have as an investor.¬†

## Starting a fund and career advice¬†

When he was a student he  had no idea what he wanted to do. The key is to work for someone you  like, admire and trust. We all have a tendency to go for the name  brands, but ask yourself what you would really like to do. Focus not  what would look good on a resume but what you would like to do and what  allows you to maximize your potential.¬†

Mohnish started his fund  in 1999. In the previous five years he turned 1 million to 10-14  million. As he always gave his friends stock tips they one day  approached him and asked if he could manage their money. As his priority  was keeping his friends, he guaranteed their principle and 6% a year,  above that he took a 25% cut similar to the Buffett/Munger partnership  in the 1960s. As his fund grew he knew he had to run it like a real  business. He set up another fund, with similar conditions except the  guarantee of principle. While his friends protested as he closed the  first fund, they all transferred their money to the new one. **They will swim to you in shark infested waters to invest with you, if you can create above market returns**.¬†

There are three requirements to start a fund:¬†

* Be independently wealthy
* Have a good track record
* Friends and family should be willing to let you manage their assets.¬†

## Biggest mistake in his career

While there were many left and  right turns, the journey was good. His biggest mistake was probably in  2014, where he had the idea of a holding company that acquires insurance  companies and invests with the float. After raising 150 million in  capital buying an insurance company, and intensive learning, he realized  that his plan won‚Äôt work out. He unwinded and sold the insurance  company for a slightly higher price than what he bought it for,  returning the money. While returns for investors weren't great there  wasn‚Äôt a loss of capital. In the process he learned a lot and got a  great understanding of the insurance business."

2021-04-19 12:22:48,stocks,"not a very good comparison since its not a double negative but i get what you are saying.. so i'll rephrase what I mean.

""wasnt unexpected"" is the same as ""was expected"" is it not?  If something is not unexpected, its expected.   So using that, ""Cant say it was expected"" still has the opposite meaning to what the OP meant (unless i am misunderstanding what the OP meant)"
2021-04-19 19:17:25,stocks,"If you can't say something, that means it is false.

Therefore, ""it wasn't unexpected"" is false.

Therefore, ""I can say it wasn't not unexpected""

Also, if you have no idea if she left, you should say ""I can't say *if* she left the house today (or not)"", because if you just say ""I can't say she left the house today"", then you are saying she is home.

Anyway, OP wrote that it was unexpected.  Whether that's what OP meant, dunno, but I can't say I wouldn't inadvertently make that kind of mistake given the chance."
2021-04-19 12:28:01,stocks,"Right.. you can undo the double negative to mean the same thing. But you can‚Äôt change the triple negative to mean the opposite. That‚Äôs my point.

So let's look at Manchester United stock first in the pre market this thing is up about 10%. 

Another Italian club called juventus is up around 12%

In 2020 Man utd made 500$ million revenue but a loss in profits because of covid. 

If This super League thing does happen Manchester United could potentially double their revenue to 1 billion dollars in a matter of 1 year.

The super League if you guys don't know about it is going to look a lot like the NBA. The most valuable team in the NBA is the golden state warriors and they are worth 4 billion dollars while Manchester United are only worth 2 billion. I believe man utd could potentially 3x or 4x in the next 10 years if the football super League does happen because football is a much bigger sport than basketball the club's will be able to make more money and uefa and FIFA won't be able to get a slice of that money this is why they don't want this new league to go ahead because they will lose alot of money also the super League will have financial backing from JP Morgan the biggest bank in the world if iam not wrong so all this is legit. 

I personally hate man utd to death ü§£ because I support Manchester city but Iam going to put rivalry aside and buy this great opportunity. I currently do own man utd and juventus through a fund but iam going to buy more of man utd.

If you guys don't know Manchester United trades on the NYSE."
2021-04-19 09:11:11,stocks,"It is the worse thing that you can ever do to football. These are big european football sharks that want to fill up their pockets even more. Not their retail investors and for sure not their fans.

This is basically a way of saying: Look, UCL and EL is all fun and games but it kinda of sucks we having to share our money other 36 clubs, most of them from countries with lower leagues. So... why don't we create our own league where we don't have to play them, risking embarassent if we loose and divide the profits amount us? And don't worry we will leave 5 places for the rest of the teams to have the opportunity to join in, in case you guys want to accuse us of elitism.

Now, this is the worse thing that you can do to any kind of sport that has the main target since its creation to be inclusive. Everyone, and I mean 99,99% that actually care about the sport are agaisnt. From Federations, National leagues, other clubs (like Bayern, Dortmund or FC Porto that were invited and refused), UEFA, FIFA, football players, coaches and most important the fans.

There a clubs joining that in the past few years are far from achieving good results: AC Milan, Internazionale and M. United are good examples of it. In the past years they are even having a hard time getting to UCL, yet alone win it, with clubs like Ajax, Shaktar, Roma, FC Porto, Dortmund getting the best out of them.

This is nothing but a fake coup agaisnt UEFA to gain more money, attention and get some new changes (like UCL going for 36 clubs) undone. Proof of this? Read the latest Barcelona FC press realese where they admit that they have the biggest interest in keeping conversations with UEFA and FIFA to improve the quality of already existing competitions.

Even if this goes foward there is one more isue: Some clubs have to do elections to see if this gets approved. Not shareholders elections but fans elections and that will never pass in at least 2-3 clubs.

And UEFA, FIFA and football federations won't let this go easy. They will be blocked from entering UCL and EL, but also national leagues plus they can prohibit players to go in international duty.

So, football wise... this is might be the worse decision and by far the most contested one for decades and for it to go all the way... it is a long shot.

With that said, I disagree with you when you consider that this is a good opportunity to stock up on football clubs stocks. On paper it might look like they will be victorious and they will double their revenue but... the chances of that happening are minimal

Note: I'm a football fan and this is one of the worse things that happened. I honestly feel sick just thinking about how these clubs are thinking. Thus, my post so far might seem a bit over the top  but I don't intent to go agaisnt the OP and just completly bash him and say his stupid.

""‚ÄúWe will try to use all the sanctions against the Super League clubs. As soon as possible they have to be BANNED from all our competitions, players too‚Äù. 

 ‚ÄúThese are so-called big clubs, it is clear that the big clubs of today were not always big clubs. Juventus were in Serie B, Man United before Sir Alex Ferguson was I don't know where‚Äù.  (BIG OOFF)

""We will do the sanctions we can do within the law, of course‚Äù. 

 ‚ÄúThe players that will play in the Super League will be banned from playing in the World Cup and Euros. Ceferin. They will not be allowed play for their national teams‚Äù.  

In terms of stocks, this clubs will most likely be sanction this season already, both monetarly and with bans from International Competitions where they get most of their millions (prizes, views, tickets, sponsors, players). If this is confirmed... what OP would think it would be amazing for the clubs its going to destroy them financially when they are already crippled from Covid. Plus more and more players are coming out against the Super League, players from said teams, such as Bruno Fernandes from M.United or Jo√£o Cancelo from M. City.

Moreover this:

""Serie A clubs will meet today afternoon to talk about Super League situation - Juventus, Inter and AC Milan will not attend the meeting.  

Spanish clubs are planning for a meeting on Thursday to discuss about Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atl√©ti position after joining Super League.""

National leagues are also planning to sanction the clubs just for what happened in the last 24h. I can tell you that both the Italian and Spanish leagues do not go easy on punishments

These are just a few updates of the last few hours. If you guys are interested in all the situation or want to know more about it, a good place to start is the twitter of Fabrizio Romano, the football journalist that is known for knowing everything before anyone else... and yes, getting everything right!"
2021-04-19 08:37:42,stocks,"Tbh I don't know why fans hate this for me this looks like a good idea and it will only replace the champions League not the national League so the premier League or la Liga can go on as normal.

I personally think this will probably happen because this has serious backing from a serious player like JP Morgan also Manchester United have left the football association and ed Woodward has left his role at uefa. Chelsea are also going to announce they will leave the European football association. 
The Italian league will have a meeting today about the super League and juventus AC Milan and inter Milan will not attend this meeting.

The Spanish league are also planning to have this meeting

The only reason psg are not joining is because their owner is on the uefa board so he wants to play the champions League while the German clubs are owned by the fans but in the future I think these clubs will budge and finally join the European super League if they don't then all their best players will simply leave for more money.

This competition looks serious"

2021-04-19 08:50:52,stocks,"From a footballing perspective everyone knows a standard league competition will not run alongside this and if it does every team will seek to field a weakened side week when it doesn‚Äôt matter as competition is irrelevant.

Typical city fan."
2021-04-19 08:55:00,stocks,"Loooool ü§£ they just said this competition will look like a replacement for the champions League.


Clubs before their champions League games almost always play their weak side if you haven't noticed that's why city lost Vs Leeds in the league but we beat BVB in the champions League ü§£


All this new competition is doing is taking the middle man away so uefa will have no money while the club's will get all the money this is more of a fair Idea.

If you haven't noticed both FIFA and uefa are corrupt just look where the 2022 world cup is"
2021-04-19 08:59:13,stocks,"It absolutely won‚Äôt. If they‚Äôre playing against Real Madrid every week they‚Äôll want to play less and less games, not more for the sake of playing. 

Yes they absolutely do and it‚Äôs part of managing a squad to play in the biggest club competition in the world, but they aren‚Äôt doing that every week because they need to be competitive on all fronts. 

Under this new model they could literally use the premier league to train their U18 team and first team play only ESL games because there‚Äôs no need to be competitive.

Furthermore, with the amount of backlash and boycotts from actual football fans there‚Äôs a far smaller market."

I have looked at a few different sources and they all show the same high yield, but something doesn't make sense."
2021-04-19 09:24:06,stocks,"For whatever reason, they paid around $4 this past year. In 2019, (the fund was made in 2019, so it was a partial year) they only paid around 14 cents.

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Dollar cost averaging question. I'm new to investing on my own and new to Webull. I have a general question about dollar cost averaging and lowering your average cost.

When selling stocks that have multiple buy points I believe that webull has a policy of first in/first out. So if I bought 10 shares at 20 dollars and kept buy 10 more for every dollar drop in price until 14/share for an average of 17 dollars.

Here's the question. If it is trading at 14 and I believe it will be trading at 17 dollars within three months would it be feasible and wise to sell 10 shares at 14 and buy them right back to lower my average to 16?"
2021-04-19 08:10:23,stocks,"What you‚Äôre basically saying is you want to take a $6/share loss now and hope it‚Äôll go up so you can make an imaginary $3/share ‚Äúgain‚Äù later. 

Keep holding the shares or buy more to lower your avg cost."
2021-04-19 08:12:24,stocks,"Dollar cost averagin means you pick an arbitrary number, lets say $100. So now that you have your ""dollar cost"" you spend that $100 every month, sometimes you buy less sometimes you buy more but you ALWAYS spend $100 (risk tolersnce and flexibility are requirements for investing but essentially spend the same each month). Finally, the averaging part is done by the market as it, on average, moves up. 

Idk what you are talking about or what youre even trying to ask but its not DCA."
2021-04-19 09:24:27,stocks,"All logical answers even I can understand. Thank you all for the guidance, and honesty.

I guess inside I know the right way to go, but sometimes you need your friend to smack you hard when your doing something dumb."
2021-04-19 08:29:58,stocks,Average cost is just a number!
2021-04-19 08:57:12,stocks,"I think what you are trying to say is that you want to have a lower ""average cost"" so that it appears that you made more money, such as if you bought in at 15 but now its 14, if you sell and buy back at 14, then it will show you are even. That doesnt make you any more money, you don't just buy and sell stocks quickly like that. If you believe a stock will make you money, you buy it and holid it as long as you still believe it will make money. They always go up and down and the avg. Cost doesnt really matter over the long term.   Also, if you hold stocks over a year, you pay less tax on gains, so you definitely dont want to be selling and buying back in for no reason."
2021-04-19 08:06:37,stocks,This doesn‚Äôt even make sense
2021-04-19 08:19:13,stocks,"You‚Äôre thinking average price of the stock you‚Äôre holding. When you buy 10 shares at $10, 10@ $15 and 10@ $20, your average cost is 15. When you sell any amount, the cost does not change. The average cost is only tied to what you spend, not what you earn or sell"
2021-04-19 09:30:05,stocks,"Most brokers default to FI/FO, but you should be able to specify which exact shares you want to sell (higher or lower priced ones).   Look for an option to sell by lot (I think that's what it's called)."

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Valuation of Coinbase? First of all thank you to all of you out there adding great content here every day.

And now over to my question..

I have been looking into Coinbase ( COIN - Nasdaq ) after the IPO. Last year the company published earnings of $1.3B, and guiding for Q1 21 at 1.8B and net profilt $400-$500m. Currently the float is 199m stocks, at $337 making the value $67B. 

If Q1-Q4 comes in at the same EPS would be like $9-10. 

I see analysts push buy ratings from $381-$600. And for $600 this seems to high for me. 

What do you guys think of this as a medium to long term investment? Are there any red flags?"
2021-04-19 09:04:19,stocks,What competitive advantage do they have that is difficult to replicate by bigger firms or banks?
2021-04-19 08:12:17,stocks,"In my opinion it is difficult to say how to evaluate the value of a company these days and determine a fair market price.  The good news for COIN is that it is one of the few IPO/DPO that actually makes a profit year in/out.  The main consideration I had was do I think there is growth in this company, and I believe with the increase in Crypto and mainstream adoption becoming more apparent, there is a good chance that it will.  The multiples across the board and market are crazy and difficult to predict.  Right now, this seems to be the only crypto exchange trading on the market giving it 100% in the trading market.  I'm sure that this will change over time.  Question is, how long before other crypto exchanges try to do the same or better yet, how long before one of the big boys buy / acquire another exchange to offer their customers a direct trade option in crypto along with equities.  Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity etc. have the capital to make an acquisition, question is, will they?  I think they are waiting for regulatory clarity before dipping their toes into these markets, but once the fear goes away and clarity is provided, it just seems to make sense to have crypto access from equity trading accounts to diversify portfolios."
2021-04-19 14:40:58,stocks,Maybe ask over at /r/coinbaseshareholders
2021-04-19 15:06:50,stocks,"I think....

It‚Äôs tough to give them the current valuation and at the same time it is an emerging market.

I think their valuation is a percentage of the market their in, and therefore, somewhat out of their control.

I like their service - I use them. Don‚Äôt @ me. I don‚Äôt own any stock. I‚Äôm into my positions at the moment. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd enter now because my plays are a different style."
2021-04-19 10:11:52,stocks,"Their revenue is incredibly dependent on price of cryptos as they take %cuts of transactions. 

If Bitcoin and other cryptos contunue to rise, so will Coinboise earnings.

The opposite is true as well.

Very unpredictable revenue growth."
2021-04-19 09:21:47,stocks,"It could be the next Tesla style stock, but at the same the negatives of crypto are begining to be reviewed by countries. Turkey for example out right banned it and India is in talks about doing the same. Environmental agencies are looking at the energy expenditure of useless computation. Also us regulators have commented about crypto as a threat to the dollar, which in turn could be a good bye to crypto."
2021-04-19 07:39:06,stocks,The fact the CEO dumped loads of shares on IPO day is a huge red flag. He obviously thinks the company is overvalued.
2021-04-19 12:35:49,stocks,"Honestly, just ignore analysts completely, they have their own motivations and interests.

As others said, and as mentioned in the very long \`RISK FACTORS\` section of their fillings, their whole business model is reliant on cryptos. Their financial results depend directly on cryptos valuation and public interest in them.

IMO, investing in Coinbase is the same as investing in an ETF for cryptos + competition risks.

2021-04-19 11:46:03,stocks,"They're vertically integrated. Other competitors like Voyager or BlockFi source their crypto from exchanges like Coinbase for trading on their own platform. They also have the competitive advantage of being the longest-standing major US crypto exchange that has not suffered a security vulnerability or flaw, making them the first choice for institutional investors. Institutional transactions have been the majority of their revenue since 2020."
2021-04-19 09:13:35,stocks,"Thanks for the question. My take on this is that they have 56 million customers, and a lot of active ones that leave revenue. It also has some billions worth of crypto currencies in their plattform. Any ‚Äònew‚Äô contender would have to put some serious effort into building a company. Currently Coinbase has 1300 employees. But yes, if someone comes up with a businessplan that would affect the price. But I‚Äôm not aware of any of the big that are in process of going into this, except Governments."

2021-04-19 12:18:33,stocks,I dont really understand this. Putting 100 dollar into crypto and getting a 1% transaction fee on this is not going to change with the price of crypto? 100 dollars in crypto is 100 dollars in crypto whatever the price? What am i missing?

2021-04-19 07:53:43,stocks,"This is not a huge red flag. As this was a DPO (not an IPO) all shares offered came from the existing shares owned by the founders and existing investors. No new shares were created. So in order for the rest of us to buy he *had to* sell.

2021-04-19 13:24:26,stocks,"They probably also charge when it goes the other way too.  That $100 of BTC you buy (they get $1) increases in value to $200 next year, then when you withdraw they get $2.  So they get $1 now, and $2 more later.  

Not a user or invested in crypto.  I think the whole thing will crash when it gets banned by the US and other governments under the guise of cracking down on money laundering, which I think will happen in the next few years."
2021-04-19 09:49:23,stocks,"Yeah that guy has no idea about Crypto fundamentals. You literally *can‚Äôt* ban it, it was designed with this in mind.

2021-04-19 08:25:51,stocks,Fuark. I want to get out but I have an average cost of 185. Not sure whether it's gonna ever go back up to that. Should have gone with my gut feeling and exited when I had the chance.

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Toyota Unveils New EV, Joins Volkswagen‚Äôs Bet on Electric Future Toyota Motor Corp.  is accelerating up its push into electric vehicles with the release of its first SUV built on a new EV platform, joining Volkswagen AG ‚Äôs splashy bet on the future of electric cars.

The world‚Äôs largest carmaker previewed its ‚ÄúbZ4X,‚Äù an electric SUV sitting on its new ‚Äúe-TNGA‚Äù platform

 at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show on Monday. The vehicle is a compact SUV that resembles Toyota‚Äôs popular Rav-4, but is built on a entirely new platform and features a distinctive yoke instead of a traditional steering wheel, as well as a system that can recharge the car‚Äôs battery using solar power.

By 2025 Toyota plans to introduce 15 EVs, including seven ‚ÄúbZ‚Äù series models globally, said Toyota Chief Technology Officer Masahiko Maeda, speaking at a briefing Monday. The bZ4X is the first of the ‚ÄúbZ‚Äù series, which stands for ‚Äúbeyond zero,‚Äù or cars that exceed being ‚Äújust zero-emission,‚Äù according to Toyota. Toyota plans to produce the bZ4X in Japan and China and sell it worldwide by mid-2022.

2021-04-19 15:42:02,stocks,"I am of the mindset that EV start ups are the new Internet start up gimmick. You make some IP and the smart plan is to sell out to a major player just like tech start ups used to do with Apple, Google, and Microsoft. Lately we have seen a lot of start ups trying to go the distance thanks to crowd funding but in reality this is not the market to try that tactic due to initial costs."
2021-04-19 19:50:14,stocks,"Once you have the battery, EVs are actually much easier to make than gas engine. The biggest threat to Toyota is not Tes1a, but that anyone (ie Apple) with manufacturing capability can enter the space with relative ease. Note also that by 2035 batteries will certainly be a commodity (ie brand name will not matter, simply a race to the bottom on profit margin). 

If you want to know why Toyota is late, it's not due to lack of engineering expertise...they simply make more money selling traditional cars. Maintenance costs are much lower on EVs for example. EVs are unfortunately bad business for the car industry, even though they are good for consumers."
2021-04-19 15:09:21,stocks,"The only true players in EVs are Tesla, VW, and Chinese EV makers.

As for green trucks, Lion Electric is already in the game, but it could be eclipsed by Volvo later this decade."

2021-04-19 15:32:13,stocks,"What would be really cool is if we could get trailers that have battery banks built into them. Then you could have an electric vehicle with a motor capable of hauling 15,000ibs and the extra energy in storage to make up for the loss range/performance when a trailer is attached. Heck, you could even put a small motor in the trailer that can provide a small amount of additional propulsion on steep grades and then act as an extra bit of braking potential when going downhill."
2021-04-19 10:26:15,stocks,I'm getting ready to buy a Tesla and I'm always excited to see more companies busting out EV's. Do these musk cultist not realize it's better for everyone and the earth to have more options üôÅ

Tesla had one thing many of today's hyped EV stocks don't have, time to actually develop their EV tech, bring it's costs down, and build out factories before the big players took EVs seriously. Tesla (with help from various government regulations) has forced the big players into making EVs, so they won't just sit around for half a decade while Lucid and others figure out how to bring the costs down of their EVs."

2021-04-19 08:43:20,stocks,"I'd argue the opposite. They're already so late they'll go out of business doing it. Converting a company as large as Toyota to make 100% EVs will be incredibly expensive and cause them to go through multiple years of unprofitability. Seeing how most of the legacy automakers' shareholders are short term thinkers, this will probably weigh on the company heavily, and they already have massive debt.

And don't forget they're not even all in yet. Just a few months ago their president was saying how Hybrids are the future and the Japanese government should stop EV adoption at all cost."
2021-04-19 07:48:47,stocks,Yep. Not to mention existing factories and the skilled labor filling them that can be revamped to produce any kind of vehicle with a shut down of a few weeks.

2021-04-19 08:39:13,stocks,"Yeah, that's why innovative startups literally never take out well entrenched giants in their industry. Just ask Netflix how well taking on Blockbuster went for them, and then ask Apple how well taking on Nokia went for them. /s"

2021-04-19 08:34:50,stocks,"On the contrary. The bigger the company the slower it tends to become, and automotive companies as well as Japanese companies in general are notoriously slow, hierarchal and old-fashioned.

A ""debt-strapped start-up"" is exactly the kind of company that can be agile and adapt new technologies faster. For these large legacy automakers switching to 100% EVs will mean going through multiple years of being money-losing businesses while their shareholders generally tend to be short term minded."
2021-04-19 08:28:48,stocks,"Have you ever seen an auto company from the inside? They are inflexible behemoths, rigid management and much much legacy processes and software weighing them down. They might have pull, yes, but you are massively overestimating their ability to change. Also, converting ICE factories to EV is really, really hard. Not only are most workers useless for the all-new tech, but the gigantic supply chains have to be cut almost completely and remade (with suppliers losing out because of the much simpler nature of an EV).
I'm really want to see them succeed, but they have to pivot their business model, suppliers, management, structure, engineering, manufacturing and overall focus. They have a really rocky road ahead of them."

2021-04-19 08:37:18,stocks,"You think you can just push a button and suddenly an ICE factory is building EVs? It takes months to convert a factory and it's almost as expensive as building a factory from scratch, while the factory output will always be much lower than a factory that was designed to produce EVs from the start. The factories legacy automakers have aren't assets when it comes to producing EVs, they're liabilities. Not to mention the staff that needs to be retrained or let go (yes, firing people is expensive if you're not located in the US), as EVs require many fewer parts and the ones they do require are different."

2021-04-19 08:41:47,stocks,"The difference is a CAD design and a handful logistics calls such as inverters and battery cells.

A car's superstructure is anyways changed every few years due to platform shifts.

Most electronics can be adapted with ease. In fact a dude around managed to backyard coock and register an EV on a renault Megan platform.

Most subsystems, transmission including are similar enough to even be jurry rigged in order to work on EV style.

If you believe a car manufacturer makes cars.... you are wrong. Sometimes they don't even make their effing engines. 

The Renault-Nissan Coalition Forces been whoring the 1.5 DCi/TDCi engine on everything.... Mercedes, Peugeot even effing Volvo have been dipping in that.

It would be as simple as making a new generation shell. Most of the rest can be ordered from 3rd parties.... You might say the ""BUT THE COST IS TOO GREAT AND PERFORMANCE WOULD SUCK"".

It doesn't even need to be affordable. Pleebs will pay. Just has to be a few K less than something else.

And you'd be 100% right!

No one would want to buy a shit 2 doors, no frunk/trunk, POS   in which you can't fit a handbag properly and that has a range of 3 miles if you good at pushing.

Unless... Renault Zoe. That shit us close to useless except for maybe intra city job commute .... but it sells.

If you include the planning and logistics parts of the process, then yeah it takes months or years but if they‚Äôre already announcing vehicles they‚Äôre already well into that process. 

Also Electric engines are actually simpler to manufacture. There are fewer moving parts. And the rest of the manufacturing process (body, frame, etc) are the same.

A ICE transmission is nothing alike an EV transmission, but I agree that the fundamental knowledge needed is the same. Still, the hardware is very much different. All the tooling of old-auto will become useless, they have to buy most technology (such as batteries and motors, because they are new to them) and are nowhere near the software skills needed. 
Also, they have a very hard time making attractive EVs anywhere near comparable cost to their ICEs, simply because outsourcing has increased and they can't rely on their steady service margins anymore."

EDIT: Outside of EV's their lead in battery and solar roof technology is next to none. I'm in the architecture world I truly believe that as those cost come down, people will want their solar roofs instead of solar panels attached to it."
2021-04-19 11:42:24,stocks,"EVs are now more expensive than ICE cars, so unless you are an EV enthusiast it is not worth it. If there will be a breakthrough in battery technology you might be right, but I doubt it. 

If the batteries will be much cheaper, many companies would make them, there is les complexity. Tesla cars a nice and trendy like a fashion item, but I would never invest in them, because their CEO is a conman. FSD and TBC are lies."

EV tranny? Maybe a reductor at best.

If anything most EV's are actually easyer to make."
2021-04-19 10:32:25,stocks,"It can't.

 But if you can jurry rig one to the degree in which a state is willing to register it for road use, I say that's a pretty good indicator of how little the shift is from ICE platform to EV.

Even if it was lead-acid battery pack and had a range of ... ooof miles... the thing was road legal, all mandatory safety and driver assistance systems fully operational."
2021-04-19 10:40:38,stocks,"well... they weren't.

In my honest opinion, there's a shit ton of marketing and pr fuckery around tesla. 

There's also no urgency to shift the production. Especially since all EV's Tesla included are practically inferior to the most modest ICE.

It's a technology super rushed to the market, way ahead of the necessary integration in the society... there's just proper infrastructure around them yet ... not for mass adoption.


Not sure hoe much of the population lives in a house and can afford to leave their EV charging in their yard. I know 90% of the drivers in my city would be forced to drop wires down from their windows.

There's barley enough parking  as is. Parking with a charger? 10 years away minimum.

And that, kids, is probably why no one is in a rush to ditch the ICE yet.

It's not like I don't want an EV.... but... even if you gave me a free Model 3 ... I just COULDN'T keep it running no matter how hard I wanted. it's just unfesible and unreliable for me.

AND I? I AM NOT ALONE! (Stupid people rarely are lol)"
2021-04-19 12:06:57,stocks,"That's your opinion. I would argue the opposite.

Your information is incorrect though. Even without incentives, unless you plan to own a car for less than two years, most EVs are cheaper all costs considered already. Now imagine where that will put them in 10 years when the cost of batteries has been cut in three and economies of scale have started kicking in for EVs."
2021-04-19 08:54:25,stocks,well actually.... yeah and entire different platform.They do that every 4 or 5 years anyways.
2021-04-19 11:47:27,stocks,"1. This is factually incorrect, Tesla‚Äôs 2020 free cash flow was $2.8 billion, and they only had $1.6 billion of regulatory credit sales so they did have free cash flow even without reg credit sales. You might be referring to net income, which was $721 million before adjusting for stock based compensation and large one time expenses of the CEO compensation package due to the rapid rise in stock price ($2.455B after adjusting for stock based compensation).

2. Tesla‚Äôs regulatory credit business is actually growing. They‚Äôve added new partners in Europe, VW just started paying them in China, and the US is about to ramp up emissions restrictions and breathe life back into the emission credit market. This is a legitimate line of business and is here to stay in the medium term.

3. Tesla‚Äôs operating margin is trending higher and higher as their revenue growth outpaces operating cost growth. This means that they will soon be positive net income even net of emissions credits and will continue to do so. 

4. Tesla‚Äôs cash and debt position is Tesla‚Äôs cash and debt position, you can‚Äôt back out past credit sales and call it fake cash. That‚Äôs just absurd."
2021-04-19 09:26:47,stocks,"I'm no expert by any stretch, but I think you are underestimating this. If it were so easy, the EVs from old OEMs wouldn't be such utter shite, would they?"
2021-04-19 10:39:27,stocks,"Anyone can kluge together a piece of crap. Actually selling it is another matter. 

Look Toyota is in a can‚Äôt win situation here. Either they try to compete with Tesla on costs, lose out on a price to quality metric, and sell very few cars. 

Or they try to compete on a quality basis, but lose out on margin in order to keep the final price palatable to consumers and compete with Tesla. At the same time they are cannibalizing their legacy ICE sales with vehicles sold at a loss or zero margins.  

Let‚Äôs see how the bean counters are going to figure this one out......"

2021-04-19 09:18:52,stocks,Surely you're not suggesting that changing from one ICE platform to another is comparable to changing from an ICE platform to an EV platform? You literally have to replace almost all the equipment and machinery.
2021-04-19 09:27:58,stocks,I think you are overestimating how good the EVs of Tesla are... You might be a Tesla bull but IMHO most of what a Tesla is hype.

2021-04-19 13:04:39,stocks,"Ah yes, the anecdotal one example statistic. That surely proves the point for the entire market...

Also, you didn't even take into account lower cost depreciation of EVs, lower maintenance costs of EVs, lower registration costs of EVs (in most countries). Even in your - admittedly very poor - example, the EV might come out cheaper over a 10-15 year term of ownership."

2021-04-19 09:39:20,stocks,"You're just making a fool of yourself mate. VW recently spent 1 BILLION euro's to convert one of their factories that will only build 300.000 EVs a year. That's about 1/3rd of what Tesla's Giga Berlin factory costs which will produce 2.000.000 cars a year. VW also has multiple of these kinds of projects running, and they're all taking 6-12 months to complete. What you're saying is total nonsense."
2021-04-19 09:31:38,stocks,"True. Kind of like no 1 is fawning over their Volvo. It still beats the shit out of any mercedes, build quality wise.

Benz? There was a complete change of paradigm when the company switched CEO once... when the interest shifted from GermanEngineering to PumpDaStockPrice... quality took a hit."
2021-04-19 09:57:56,stocks,Do you have a source on the 6 to 12 months factory shut down?  I suspect you‚Äôve misunderstood and the switch over will happen in 6 to 12 months with a few week shut down.

2021-04-19 10:54:35,stocks,"How does this help your argument? The transition for the Zwickau factory will be completed this year and took almost three full years. [It started in 2018...](https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/countdown-to-production-start-conversion-of-zwickau-plant-to-electric-car-factory-began-in-2018-5504)

Your article also showed how VW has started conversion 8 other factories that will take at least another year before they're ready. Seems like my 6-12 months estimate was actually very much on the low side."
2021-04-19 11:24:48,stocks,"Because how long it takes to plan the design and gather the materials doesn‚Äôt matter as long as there‚Äôs a market for the ICE vehicles they produce in the meantime. I said at the start of this chain that if you include design and logistics you‚Äôre right but that they can actually do the physical converting with a few weeks shut down.     And they shut down for a few weeks per year so employees can go on vacation anyway so they‚Äôre not losing any production when they convert. For these reasons, traditional automakers‚Äô existing facilities and skilled labor force are an asset, not a liability. 

VW will have vastly more EV facilities and EV production capacity than Tesla once they get their factories converted while not losing out on any of their current ICE vehicle profits in the meantime - profits which already dwarf Tesla. The same will be true of Toyota and any other traditional automaker who get in now. 

Tesla‚Äôs head start just isn‚Äôt very big except maybe in full self driving tech but that‚Äôs currently illegal to use on most roads and traditional automakers have more lobbyists than Tesla. It won‚Äôt be legal on most roads until the majority of new cars produced have safe and effective FSD."
2021-04-19 11:30:22,stocks,"You have to stop making stuff up. The article clearly shows how this is not just a lot of planning with only a few weeks of actual transformation time:

>Transformation of the Zwickau plant is being completed in stages and during normal operation. Conversion got underway just over two years ago. Since then, the body shop, paint shop and infrastructure have been extensively modernized and refurbished. Among other things, the entire conveyor technology had to be aligned to electric vehicles. In addition, the first of two assembly lines was converted. The first ID.3 will leave this line in just a few days. With some 1,700 robots, driverless transport systems and fully-automated manufacturing processes, Zwickau gives a contemporary insight into the shape of forward-looking high-volume production of electric cars.

The whole process is performed in different stages over years where stuff is being replaced, retrofitted and updated.

On top of that, it costs VW more money to convert a factory (1B euros) than it costs Tesla to build a comparable factory from scratch. It's clearly not an advantage for VW, and it will be even more difficult for other carmakers that have worse balance sheets than VW. Meanwhile Tesla has no debt.

Also, let's remindme! 5 years to see if VW indeed has ""vastly more production capacity than Tesla""."

While it's disappointing I plan on holding for at least a year. I would think a year from now it should be higher than $60.50 a share. That said, it sure is disappointing to see what looks to be a good valued stock go down literally right after receiving great news (of partnering with the NFL)."

**Bull Case**

Literally [nothing significant](https://www.marketwatch.com/economy-politics/calendar) is happening over the next three days. (*EDIT: Other than earnings season, of course, as others have pointed out.)*

This is the longest stretch of time without major market data coming out that I've gotten to work with since making predictions. That suggests that the next three days of trading should be controlled by technicals without any surprises whatsoever, and with nothing but bullish news fueling our market, that's great news.

**Bear Case**

Alright -- I might be going crazy here, because I'm starting to listen to Reddit conspiracy theories. This is probably stupid. But hear me out.

Banks around the world had their lights on and phones ringing Saturday night after midnight. Redditors were taking pictures, checking their phone status on Google Maps, and even [flying drones around financial buildings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtgr19/a_breakdown_of_citadels_overnight_activity/) to prove that people in the executive floors were burning the midnight oil.

And now, with absolutely no bearish news made publicly available, futures are blood red.

Cities never sleep, so it's not that crazy for the lights to be on at night, but as you read through the post I linked above, you really get drawn into a rabbit hole of believing that there's something strange going on here that's probably not going to be good news.

Anyway. That's probably just crazy talk.

I'm forecasting a **red day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,025** and a **low of 13,976**, with the market **closing higher than it opened**.

[*See past results and visualizations from forecasts that weren't based on conspiracy theories here.*](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/yEPBC)"

Growth stocks will likely continue to face slight downward momentum throughout they year as investors continue to rotate into value plays until the opportunity in value is mostly ""saturated"".  If a correction occurs in the major indices, which is long overdue, growth will dip further versus the March 8th Tech Correction Dip. If a correction occurs I'd expect stocks such as NIO/TSLA/PLTR to dip another 20-30%

Growth will become more relevant in FY22 and Beyond.

He hasn't made any contributions to it in 2021 yet.

How can I help him do a backdoor roth IRA? 
Would it better if he created a new separate IRA account, contributed $6k to it. Then create a Roth account and then transfer the $6k?

I am confused about his existing $40k account... The article and video I watched had said to make sure there's no other money in any IRAs before doing a rollover? Also, with the 2020 deadline passed, he can't roll over any of the $40k to a Roth, correct? So basically he needs to start 2021 and onwards?

If your answer was that the speculation fever is likely over, you'd be correct.

Honestly, I'm surprised myself. I figured it would continue for at least a little while longer, but so far, that answer looks like NO.

I still don't consider the double top lower high idea to be valid in .IXIC at all because of what NDX has been doing (and because there's an unfinished auction again in the Nasdaq-100), but it looks like the speculation unwinding in .IXIC is going to cancel that again."

The thing that could reverse this trend is announcement of a huge contract or several major contracts. (i.e. if they announced a 300 million contract with AT and T or something). 

My target for this stock in next 6 months is around 15-18 if the economy remains strong/neutral, 12-15 if a market wide correction occurs, and 25+ if they announce a series of LARGE contracts (bonus points for commercial sector)"

I bought a share today so now I have a whopping 4 lol."
2021-04-19 15:29:50,stocks,"If you're getting FOMO you probably ought to practice restraint here. MSFT is going ex-dividend next month and May tends to be the start of the so-called ""worst 6 months,"" so perhaps you could get in at a better price if you just wait. It's not egregiously overvalued---about at a level similar as APPL---and it's not going anywhere anytime soon, so it's probably not a risky investment but you'll feel like crap if you buy now and it ends up sliding 6% the next quarter. I'm long MSFT, full disclosure."

2021-04-19 15:29:32,stocks,"I think it's mostly small cap heavy people sweating. The market has been going up overall, but mostly because the mega caps are carrying it on its back. For the small caps the last week has been either red, or very red. 

Most of my portfolio is in FAANG+VTI, so I'm okay, but the 15% of my port which is speculative/small cap is being rocked."
2021-04-19 15:22:07,stocks,"It's weird because whenever there's a good streak, I'm like, ""Damn, I should've increased my exposure to X. I'll be sure to the next time we have a bad day.""

A lot of spec stocks are even below their IPO prices.

2021-04-19 10:25:07,stocks,i think so too but not like a crazy drop just red week or two due to earnings.

Pinterest isn't. Their ad data tends to look really good in Pinterest Ads, as long as you don't look at the whole picture. But the people who click on them immediately bounce off the site without interacting with it and, if they do interact, end up being click farm spam instead of real customers.

Obviously there's a lot going on with the company, but I'd like to see a plan to exit some of the investments and turn the paper gains into cash, and get some updates on some stuff before I buy any more shares. So I think I'm sitting tight until the next earnings report.

To all those not from Europe who don‚Äôt fully understand what is happening. The super league will be created and will fail. Why? Well, if most of European soccer clubs don‚Äôt support it (German and French clubs already said no). What will happen is, that those clubs that join in the hopes of a way of clearing some of their debt will see their club and players excluded from all UEFA and FIFA tournaments. Even the British government is against it as it would damage their home league. For me it is just a push by hedge funds and US billionaire‚Äòs who want to get into the football action. Good luck, we in Europe like it when a small club wins the league and we like underperforming teams to drop down from the league.

Tax avoidance is bigger than just tech, it happens everywhere with everything and governments are the ones that need to prevent it. It's a big deal in tech because it's a huge amount of money being lost.

And wtf are you talking about with data centres, it's a thing of now and the future whether we like it or not. We're not suddenly going to stop everything and come to a halt back to the stone age.

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Manchester United and The Super League (TSL) The Super League is on its way making $MANU a way for investors to participate.

Twelve of Europe's top soccer clubs have announced plans to form a so-called European super league, in a move that looks set to rock the foundations of the sport's top competitions, including preeminent leagues in England, Spain and Italy and extending all the way up to the World Cup.

A joint statement says the league will ultimately consist of 20 clubs and be governed by the founding clubs. Manchester United is a founding club.

**Positive:**

*  no more missing out on ""Champions League FootbalL"" aka ""The Super League""
*  more revenue (Founding clubs will receive an amount of ‚Ç¨3.5bn solely to support their infrastructure investment plans and to offset the impact of the Covid pandemic.)

**Negative:**

* potential ban by UEFA/FIFA
* fan revolts
* political opposition

**The future:**

Like it or not, the Super League will become an NFL-like league.In the long run, that means more money, a proper salary cap and the reduction of transfer costs. 

$MANU will start printing money.

**This is obviously not a financial advice.**

**Edit: I get it, nobody likes the idea of a super league. I still think that $manu is a good investment right now (and it is also +8% on the day)"

You think there will be a JP Morgan cup replacing a world cup? If FIFA and fans agree on a stance, you know that the project is doomed.  Change in football is needed, but it will come in another shape, maybe in reaction to this dystopian suggestion.

2021-04-19 02:57:59,stocks,I love qebulls graph but it's not as clean as RH. imo. Options is kind of a mess.
2021-04-19 06:25:36,stocks,Literally nobody allows you to daytrade with <25000
2021-04-19 02:56:56,stocks,Mine was strictly cash. I'm gonna try t1 out. I just like the interface for options. Webull is ugly and clunky imo but I like webull graph

2021-04-19 09:16:23,stocks,Disgusting
2021-04-19 10:47:32,stocks,Everything
2021-04-19 12:00:29,stocks,They restricted trading to only sell orders on Gamestop and AMC when they were going way up because of the whole Wallstreetbets thing. Literally manipulated the market and caused the price to go tumbling. Among many other sketchy things they‚Äôve done.
2021-04-19 03:02:56,stocks,Interactive Brokers
2021-04-19 07:02:36,stocks,If you're a cash account you can make as many trades a you want as long as you have settled cash
2021-04-19 06:36:12,stocks,"My regular bank, where i keep my cash, let's me daytrade. You just buy. Then sell. Then buy again. Who would dare tell you how you're allowed to spend your own cash money for which your broker is not liable in any way lol. You're talking about margin requirements. If you have no loan from the broker and just have 100$ they don't care if you buy for 100$, sell for 70$, then buy again a bit less for 90$ until you're all out."
2021-04-19 03:00:39,stocks,"Robin hood is shit. They will keep you as margin even when you are ""strictly cash"". Then margin call you whenever they want despite you not extending over your cash amount ever.

All you want from an ""app"" is to click buy or sell quickly. For prices use yahoo finance"
2021-04-19 05:41:56,stocks,No bad bot
2021-04-19 03:03:29,stocks,I'll check it out thanks! Free transactions?
2021-04-19 06:37:55,stocks,Lol you literally can't daytrade with less than 25k. It's an SEC rule.
2021-04-19 03:01:48,stocks,What do you suggest? I would use webull If they changed there interface up some.
2021-04-19 03:04:50,stocks,"It has free version but the pro version charges some fees but they are minimal,Also the amount you save on fills is better than the broker who use payment for order flow and advertise as free.

Trust me much much better fills than Robinhood"
2021-04-19 06:46:27,stocks,It's an SEC rule that a retail investor can't buy and sell securities unless they have 25k dollars? What if they have money in euros and due to the exchange rate their amount of euros was worth 25k but suddenly it's worth 24k? The rule is for margin traders only.
2021-04-19 03:13:27,stocks,"I don't have any of your fancy american brokers. Use webull. Use fidelity. I think many gme-ers love that one. Don't cry about the interface, it's all about the money, not how much confetti you see on the screen when you click buy/sell. You want money, not a pretty interface. And it's been documented how RH screws you out of money in many ways."
2021-04-19 06:11:15,stocks,"IMO every UI sucks compared to robin hood. I'm on webull now, and it definitely takes some getting used to."
2021-04-19 03:05:47,stocks,Cool will peep out later. Thanks alot.
2021-04-19 06:50:18,stocks,"If your closing balance is less than 25k then you are subjected to pattern day trader restrictions... so even if you have 100k and you lose 76k and close at 24k, you will be marked a PDT if you make more than 3 day trades in a week."
2021-04-19 05:18:38,stocks,It's not about confetti or popping visuals. I just want something clean. Imo RH has the best look. I like being able to buy an option and it shows up on my main screen and shows profit loss and all that. Webull just needs to fix a few things and I would switch over to it.
2021-04-19 06:53:11,stocks,Pattern day trading restrictions... apply to margin accounts only.
2021-04-19 05:43:14,stocks,"Would you rather see lies, or not be prevented from buying, selling and not get falsely margin called or even have your account kept on margin when you thought you switched to all cash? You make the most money in spreadsheets, yes, even in 2021 still. When you use a broker, any broker, you want money, not bells and whistles."
2021-04-19 06:57:04,stocks,And cash accounts you cannot day trade at all... you have to wait 3 days for the funds to clear after every trade.  You really sound new to this.  Why are you debating me on something you are clearly clueless about?
2021-04-19 07:04:13,stocks,Sounds like you are the only one debating and the only one clueless here. Considering you kept going on how pattern day trading restrictions apply to cash accounts. But I guess I'll have to call my broker and tell him to cancel all my losing daytrades I did because apparently I did the impossible.
2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"I'm Really Scared Hey, so I have several thousand dollars (which is a lot for me) invested via Cash App. I have been seeing a lot of things that are making me really nervous to be so heavily invested in the brokerage. I just opened a Fidelity account and I want to transfer to it so I don't have to worry anymore. I'm just concerned that I am going to mess up somewhere along the way or make an oversight and screw myself. Like I said, this is a lot of money for me, so I'm very tressed. Any and all help would be much appreciated. I can also only transfer full stocks so I will have to sell of any stock that is a percentage. I am extremely nervous for many reasons regarding this. If anyone has any insight about Cash App as a whole it would be much appreciated, thank you."
2021-04-19 01:26:05,stocks,Call Fidelity. They will handle the transfer for you.
2021-04-19 01:30:27,stocks,I did a transfer from etrade to fidelity and it went through seamlessly. I know you can buy fractional shares on fidelity but I did not try to transfer any but as was mentioned above just give them a call and they'll tell you everything you need to know
2021-04-19 02:35:42,stocks,If you dont want to sell your fractional shares or pay taxes you can always just do a partial transfer. Transfer out your whole shares and leave the fractional to sell at a more opportune time.
2021-04-19 01:34:17,stocks,"Fidelity is now your Agent and Intermediary, you pay for the service, You call them and tell them what you need."
2021-04-19 06:12:49,stocks,Why are you scared of cashapp?
2021-04-19 08:05:38,stocks,"I am not in USA and don't have access to Cashapp but OP I would do some more research on this vs rushing to switch brokerages.

If you saw a few posts on social media about Cashapp then look into this more. Cashapp is owned by Square. I can't imagine there are real worries about you losing out on your investments."
2021-04-19 03:15:45,stocks,"Hey man, you got this. If you don't want to sell, why don't you just do a partial transfer for whole shares and hold your fractional shares in cashapp for now? That way you can hold them long enough to escape short term capital gains tax."
2021-04-19 01:26:01,stocks,Send the money to your bank instead
2021-04-19 04:42:25,stocks,"Don't take me wrong, but if the transfer of several thousand dollars invested are giving you all these concerns, how would you react if the market dropped 25% overnight?

The best non financial advice anyone can give you here is to only gamble - yes, gamble - with money **you do not need**. The FOMO neither what anything anyone says in these threads are not worth the risks, potential problems and constant concerns."
2021-04-19 01:40:34,stocks,Don‚Äôt be scared. Breathe. You got this.
2021-04-19 09:18:33,stocks,"Others have given some good advice, so feel free to ignore me, but why are you investing that money if you are so scared/stressed about losing it? Obviously no one wants to lose money, or lose out on potential gains, but if you're this freaked out by it, why are you investing in individual stocks? If you can't afford to lose it, you shouldn't be investing it."
2021-04-19 12:43:55,stocks,"I was in your boat I called fidelity and I‚Äôm just so happy I did . Customer service is great but the fact that I was able to do my transfer from robinhood to fidelity without speaking to anyone threw the app was amazing. I spent more time worrying about the switch then the switch took . Think about this , it takes a week and if you can‚Äôt get to your stocks you can‚Äôt sell your stocks so if you are diamond handed like everyone claims then it should not matter."
2021-04-19 19:28:00,stocks,Switched to fidelity and love it. Highly reccomended.
2021-04-19 19:46:54,stocks,"Fidelity will charge a $75 fee to transfer. 
Give them a call and they will reimburse you"
2021-04-19 02:02:23,stocks,But wherever u do....DONT answer the phone!!!!
2021-04-19 02:01:20,stocks,Be scared....be very very scared!!!!!
2021-04-19 15:19:38,stocks,"amazing how so many people let money control them..lolz

no body wants to lose money but only invest what you're ok with parting ways with..until you realize this..enjoy being a sheep"
2021-04-19 01:44:41,stocks,This. So easy and rep was very helpful. Transferred out of RH a few months ago. Fractional shares sold. Be sure that if you have shares on margin in CashAp (whether you chose that or not) that you ask fidelity to make it type: cash.
2021-04-19 18:11:55,stocks,"Second this approach. Use fidelity to open a cash account. I feel they explain it clearly, but it is a cash only account for personal investments. They dont allow margins or anything you have been reading about in the other stonk pages. 

The purpose of the cash account is you are playing/using your own money. Though they do give you a good faith amount(credit) until your deposit comes through"
2021-04-19 11:01:43,stocks,"It was a pain In my ass for me as my address was different on schwab and fidelity kept saying it was wrong

You won't transfer my stuff because of a few letters.. why not just update the address within fidelity....nope must be done at schwab"
2021-04-19 01:45:49,stocks,"Transferring fractionals to fidelity was a pain, although I can‚Äôt be sure if its robinhood or Fidelity that I should blame.

On second thought it was probably robinhoods fault.

Yeah, definitely robinhood."
2021-04-19 09:13:35,stocks,Oh that sounds perfect I didnt know that was an option. CashApp seems to say that if I transfer I cannot buy with them anymore so I wasnt sure if that would work.
2021-04-19 01:34:53,stocks,Their service is free is it not?
2021-04-19 09:10:04,stocks,"I don‚Äôt understand why anybody would use it for investing when there are so many better brokerages out there. Fidelity, TDA, CS, etc. you‚Äôre investing without all the tools you‚Äôd want if you use RH or cash app types. Square is a solid company but investing is not its focus"
2021-04-19 09:15:13,stocks,"Check out the cash app sub, that plus my experience with their support is concerning."
2021-04-19 08:30:47,stocks,Curious about this too - what's up with cash app?
2021-04-19 01:27:53,stocks,The problem is I don't want to lose my positions or have to sell and get taxed on the earnings.
2021-04-19 09:27:05,stocks,The transfer itself is not what is scaring me. I trust the stocks I own. What is scaring me is the current brokerage my stocks are held in.
2021-04-19 01:43:53,stocks,"Thank you kind stranger, just been hearing really bad things about Cash App and regretting all of the trust I put in them."
2021-04-19 09:20:16,stocks,"I understand that, I am confident in the investments I have made. That is not what is scary to me. What is scary is that I could lose all of that without the stocks themselves diminishing. Because I like the stocks I'm in, I'm not scared of losing on the large scale or over a long period of time."
2021-04-19 02:03:01,stocks,Why do you say that..?
2021-04-19 02:03:23,stocks,Have you had experience with Cash App or something bad happening?
2021-04-19 04:34:20,stocks,"Yeah! Cashapp will withdraw and send your $ to the Mars, literally. You will need to figure out a way to retrieve it yourself. If that happens, don‚Äôt panic. Tweet Elon Musk real quick. He‚Äôll probably give you a ride to Mars.

Joke aside, just relax."
2021-04-19 06:55:45,stocks,I hope you‚Äôre never in this dudes position. Fucking pussy
2021-04-19 15:32:46,stocks,I am confident in my investments just not in my brokerage. I was just looking for advice and help seems unnecessary

2021-04-19 01:48:08,stocks,"Okay, what does type: cash mean?"
2021-04-19 01:48:36,stocks,How did you end up handling it?
2021-04-19 01:49:49,stocks,Hahaha out of the two that'd be my guess also üòÇ
2021-04-19 01:38:18,stocks,"No, you will pay commissions and broker fees on the back end."
2021-04-19 01:48:19,stocks,"Free as far as trading, somewhat.

Same business model as Robinhood data mining and selling the trade info"
2021-04-19 14:02:12,stocks,Nothing is free
2021-04-19 09:12:12,stocks,Cashapp is really easy to use for people looking to just buy and hold.
2021-04-19 09:28:32,stocks,"Convenience essentially, the investing aspect is really simple and easy to understand. I regret it now but that's why."
2021-04-19 09:16:21,stocks,Check out their sub. What people are posting there in addition to my own experiences with their customer support is what's concerning to me.
2021-04-19 01:37:20,stocks,"You know the whole ""not financial advice""? Thats us. You realize they can give you that advice."
2021-04-19 10:38:22,stocks,"Well, in a ""run for the hills"" scenario, all brokers will have a lot of liquidity issues, and potentially blocking any mass sales of stocks, under some pretense excuse like it happened for the GME case.

Under unconventional circumstances, these small investors like yourself will be cannon fodder.

So, my comment still stands: only play with money you would be willing to lose at the casino in one play of the roulette."
2021-04-19 01:47:24,stocks,What bad things were you hearing about cashapp?
2021-04-19 01:44:47,stocks,Don‚Äôt worry. You can always move or sell your positions and move your money to Schwab or Fidelity or Interactive brokers is solid
2021-04-19 02:27:51,stocks,He‚Äôs making some kind of scary movie joke
2021-04-19 04:17:04,stocks,He's teasing you
2021-04-19 07:13:00,stocks,No worries. I won‚Äôt be.
2021-04-19 07:15:18,stocks,Enjoy life. Don‚Äôt be too uptight.
2021-04-19 01:53:49,stocks,"He means you want a ""cash"" account."

2021-04-19 13:40:32,stocks,">only play with money you would be willing to lose at the casino in one play of the roulette. 

Wow, that is majorly alarmist and overboard.

Many, many people use the market as a long term retirement and savings plan. It's only roulette when you start making short term options plays, penny stocks, etc.

If you have a diversified portfolio and have 20 years or more til retirement, saying it's like dropping all your money on a single roulette spin is definitely *not* analogous."
2021-04-19 01:50:16,stocks,They are stopping withdraws and keeping people from selling their shares.
2021-04-19 01:46:44,stocks,"I know, and I'll be working on it tomorrow. The problem is with selling I be taxed 20% on gains and with the transfer I have to sell all partial shares. Fingers crossed it all works out and I try and take some breaths"
2021-04-19 07:15:28,stocks,People will like you more if you‚Äôre not an asshole. Try it. Maybe you won‚Äôt feel the need to taunt scared kids on the internet. Coward

2021-04-19 01:55:03,stocks,"Okay so when talking to them about wanting to transfer I should just specify I want it to be a cash account? Thank you all again for all of the help, I felt like I understood more of this than I seemingly do."

2021-04-19 14:21:15,stocks,"Sure. Not my point. 

Simply, Op mentioned some worries and concerns caused by having a few thousands of bucks in some broker. I think we can agree that such amounts are essentially *roulette starters* for some high-roller players. 

My failed metaphor, transposed to the stock market, tried to illustrate just that."
2021-04-19 07:18:44,stocks,Wasnt a taunt idiot. It was a movie reference. Go play in traffic.

2021-04-19 02:00:58,stocks,"First ask to speak to a broker or account "" specialist"" or whatever the woke nomenclature is. Explain your situation. Tell them what your expectations are, tell them your concerns. Let them recommend what could fit you best. Take notes. Ask for a direct number.

If market crashes next week and it's down 30%. If I sell, I will realize a loss of $60K.

If I buy VTI and hold it for long term, I am thinking it is a smart move on my side to realize the 60K loss.

Or, am I missing something?"
2021-04-19 01:08:50,stocks,"Nope, that‚Äôs pretty much what tax loss harvesting is. You could probably even replace the VOO with SPY or equivalent and still do the same thing."
2021-04-19 04:58:02,stocks,"It's a bit unclear whether VOO and VTI are considered ""substantially identical"" and thus trigger wash sale rules. https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=306173

So yes, selling VOO would lock in your $60k loss, but be careful what you buy afterwards to replace it. If you think VTI might cause a wash sale then maybe buy into a sector ETF that would still largely track the overall market. Like XLF, plus some small cap value. 

But many people are of the opinion that VOO and VTI are not considered substantially identical, and would be safe to use as a TLH pair. It's up to your judgement. If you're not familiar with the wash-sale rule then read up on it a bit, because it's a royal pain in the ass."
2021-04-19 02:32:19,stocks,Don't wash sale
2021-04-19 09:50:01,stocks,"Never base trades in taxes, sell if you feel you should, either all or half etc. during the tech bubble in 2003 I had clients with several hundred thousands in gains and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not selling now because I dint want to pay 25-33% in taxes, 3-6 months later they had tax losses.  Don‚Äôt be greedy, the Gov‚Äôt. may get 1/3rd but you still keep 2/3rds, be wise"
2021-04-19 12:42:12,stocks,"I‚Äôm pretty sure if you don‚Äôt have any other gains....you can only claim up to $3,000 in losses to offset your ordinary income. In your example the other $57,000 would just be wasted money assuming you have no gains."
2021-04-19 01:11:17,stocks,Thanks.
2021-04-19 07:21:33,stocks,"From what I gather, it's not a wash sale if he buys VTI or SPY or other similar asset instead of VOO.  Thus tax loss harvesting.  /u/ItsOnlyJustAName mentioned that VOO and VTI may be considered ""substantially identical"", and I can imagine that SPY and VOO would also face a similar issue (perhaps more so)."
2021-04-19 11:10:24,stocks,"At the same time, investing in long term trends you are confident in, allowing to strategically keep that money in and not take out to pay taxes, allows for the full power of compound growth."
2021-04-19 09:59:42,stocks,This is great advice. Wish I took it. Never get overly greedy on the stock market.
2021-04-19 01:17:27,stocks,"Just keep in mind that a 60k loss may not help you too much unless you have gains that the loss would be offsetting. You can only deduct 3k of capital loss from your regular income per year otherwise, although you can carry over the left over to subsequent years. The other thing to consider is that your basis in the replacement security is going to be 60k lower than the initial security, so you‚Äôd ultimately end up paying the taxes on that 60k too, just at a later point in time, and potentially at the long term rate."
2021-04-19 01:23:27,stocks,"The 60K tax loss helps offset future gains. Let's say this is the only loss I have and I don't see anything else. Then you are right that 3k can be deducted from salary.

The rest of the 57K is deferred to subsequent years. Next year if the market grows to ATH, then I can sell and ""wash"" the gains with the losses I deferred."
2021-04-19 04:27:23,stocks,Everything he said and you need to wait 30 days to use the money you have from selling to claim it.  If you buy another stock before 30 days it would be a wash sale and it will not count till you sell the stock that you just bought.
2021-04-19 01:25:22,stocks,"Yes, absolutely, just wanted to make sure you knew you couldn‚Äôt just deduct the entire amount from ordinary income. But yeah, it definitely carries over to offset next year‚Äôs capital gains too."
2021-04-19 04:30:55,stocks,"I don't think that is correct in only 3k of a carryover can be used in future years. The losses can only be used to ofset gains in the year they occur -- after that it's a
carried forward and you can only use 3k a year.   Let's say you have 60k losses and 30k gains one year.  You can wash the 30k gains +3k and carry forward 27k losses.  The next year, you gain 10k.

2021-04-19 05:58:19,stocks,That is incorrect.  In the second year you could use 10K of the 27K carry over to negate all of the 10k gains for that year and carry over the remaining 17K.

2021-04-19 06:56:58,stocks,That‚Äôs what I thought but I had a stock tagged as a wash sale on Fid when the only two transaction I have on said stock is 1buy order and one selling half the shares. Yet after selling half the shares it showed a wash sale even tho I‚Äôve never purchased more.
2021-04-19 06:24:35,stocks,"You should if that is what (s)he told you.  However, perhaps you just misunderstood.

My answer above wasn't the whole story either.  You can offset all the 10K gains the second year AND you can use another $3k to offset ordinary income, so you'd be carrying over $14K to the third year.

2021-04-19 07:24:15,stocks,"Just spit-balling, but could just be an error on their part, or could be you had another transaction on a stock that was considered ""substantially identical""

Another thought:  Was the sale of 1/2 the position within 30 days of the purchase?  I'd need to re-read the regs to be sure, but I think that can also trigger the wash sale rule -> the purchase of the other 1/2 being considered the purchase of the same stock within 30 days triggering the rule.  Again, I'm not positive of that, just something that is sticking in the back of my mind.  I'll likely check the regs later today, because it will bother me until I do.

&#x200B;

Edit:  I do know that the order does not matter.  Usually, it is a sale followed by a purchase within 30 days that triggers the rule, but a purchase followed by a sale within 30 days can also trigger the rule (assuming you owned some of the underlying beforehand)."
2021-04-19 06:40:27,stocks,It's possible I misunderstood and I could only take 3k cuz I had no gains to offset that year?  I was thinking I did but maybe not?   I certainly have gains this year so we'll see!

Consignment based used car retailer tapped into the fleet market and wholesale markets. Their cars are regularly priced 5-15% below SHIFT, Carvana, and Carmax. The operation procedures for their hubs are highly cost effective and they can set them up *fast*. Same time last year they had one hub, they are now penetrating the market in 5 regions and have signed leases on 10 more hubs set to open by year‚Äôs end, bringing their total up from 2 hubs in Q1 2020 to 25-30 hubs by Q1 22. They also have like $350M in cash on their books and are trading at a valuation of like $570M. EBITDA is positive on projections from the company for this quarter. I think we‚Äôre going to see a massive upset in earnings this quarter, the analysts covering the stock are still estimating non profitability.

Due to the way their business model works, they do not invest in most of their inventory, which takes a large portion of operating expenses for a used car dealer down to zero. They work on a consignment basis returning greater value to their clients, providing a cheaper product for consumers, and enlarging margin for the company. This could be a major disruptive force in the market they operate in. 

Assuming they do not dilute, if they capture 15% of the market share Carvana operates, they‚Äôll be a $200-$250 stock. I literally do not invest in anything except this stock, other than spreads/IC on short term swings.

Of course, the point is that the company is beat up PLUS there is change happening. That's crucial. Another great thing about those type of companies is that they are cheap. Anyway, my few pics that worked out very well:

**HPE.** People think that this is dying PC and printer company. It is not, that's HPQ. HPE makes hybrid cloud infra and freaking supercomputers. It was scary but I loaded up majorly at $9 a share. Can't complain.

**GM.** You honestly could not mention GM here without being downvoted. You fool, it's all about Tesla, all that. Ok, that peaked my interest. I looked into it. Profitable business, amazing CEO, hard transition to EV only by 2030 and they announced that before it was trendy, making their own batteries, owns leading autonomous driving company, P/E ratio of 5. I mean, I was seriously thinking if I was insane or it everyone else was. Been doing great so far.

**HAS.** It's toys company, it's all about video games, it's stupid Boomer toys, yada yada. What I saw was portfolio of amazing and loved IP, 3% dividend and P/E ratio of 15 (back then). Plus they own D&D IP which is really hot right now, licensing their IP to make video games and bought films studio to produce shows based on their IP. I'm very excited about Hasbro future and top up every time they pay dividend.

**GD.** Ok nobody said anything bad about GD. Well, nobody gave a shit about GD here ever. I've noticed it when share price was $130 and could not pass that kind of opportunity.

Alright, I'll stop now. To be honest picks above have already played out by now so I'm just bragging at this point. I have a long list of other hated but profitable companies that I'm slowly building position in and I hope they will work out as well as the ones above."

The housing market in the Netherlands is already going crazy, and it will only get worse in the upcoming few years. With interest rates rising, they will bank on this hard. Also, P/B ratio of only .42 atm.

Credit Suisse - Imo, the selloff last month was an overreaction of the market. Will not be holding this for the very long term though.

Fate therapeutics - biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of next-generation cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. Dropped due to the general genomics market beatdown. Speculative as well."

I like NOK (nokia) and FUBO even though they were involved in the meme stock frenzy recently. Nokia has been a viable company for a long time and continues to be relevant in the mobile tech sector. 

FUBO has a lot of potential for real growth over the next few years, but is really a long shot. Not a sure thing.

WATT - Energous. They have pioneered consumer RF-based (contactless wifi charging). Charing electronic devices at a distance with what they call 3D energy pockets. This technology is real and has been demonstrated to be a truly viable solution for mobile and IoT devices. They have a very positive future, and the stock has dipped recently so its a good buy right now."
2021-04-19 13:10:06,stocks,"TBA - It's a SPAC, so it's getting dumped on right now with all the others. But they're going to become ironSource (IS) in a few months, an $11 billion mobile adtech company. I worked in mobile marketing for a long time, and I've worked directly with IS at several companies. They are counted in the top 5 mobile marketing companies overall, with Google, Facebook, AppLovin and Unity. Every single major mobile gaming company, and many smaller ones, use IS as a part of their marketing suite. In my personal experience, they are great at getting scale in certain genres, and generally returned fairly well on ad spend. 

Their major weakness to me was that they were best at scaling in the puzzle and hypercasual genres, and not so great on core games, which are going to be the major driver of growth in mobile over the next 5-10 years. There is also the impending launch of iOS 14.5, which will severely hamper advertising capabilities across all mobile marketing firms by limiting the types of data that games can pass back to advertisers. Right now, that's not as large a risk as most outsiders anticipate it to be. I personally doubt anyone is going to stop advertising in mobile - they'll just move spend to Android (which IS had a huge presence on). I however anticipate Google to make a similar move over the next year or two, (Apple is always the first moved in these cases and the rest follow) and that could really test adtech stocks in the short term. It won't be a long term issue if you're a long investor, though, imo. The industry is just growing too aggressively, and anyone worth their salt in mobile knows that the instant you turn off paid advertising, your game dies due to the way Apple and Google's search algorithms are structured. So people won't stop spending long term.

Regardless of potential weaknesses in the short term, I'm majorly bullish on TBD/IS long term. They can easily overcome their weakness in core through acquisitions, and although they are already used by every major mobile gaming company, there is room for them to juice more business out of those companies by expanding into core, further improving their return on ad spend for clients, and introducing disruptive solutions to counteract the inevitable blows from iOS 14.5. They also have a gaming branch, which I don't count as a substantial part of their business but which could grow, especially if further integrated with their advertising side. Even with headwinds, compare with Unity and AppLovin prices and this is not a $10 stock imo.

I'm no longer in paid mobile advertising, so these are just my opinions based on having been in the industry previously"

Their business is well diversified with their Semi-unit reporting strong growth. While TSM is ridiculously priced (even considering 20%+ CAGR rates in the future). Samsung is completely overlooked.

Trading at an EV/EBITDA of approx 9?. This is a joke considering their FCF-generation and their rock solid BS and margins (pls compare to peers like TSM, Apple or semi-design stocks like AMD).

Risk is obviously their ownership structure and the listing in South Korea.

Company in Alberta, Canada that takes a wide-range of feedstock to create renewable diesel. Some high points for the company:

- In North America there are 7 types of plastic. Only types 1 and 2 can be recycled, leaving the other 91% of plastics to sit in landfills. Cielo can turn all these into renewable diesel.

- Renewable diesel is not biofuel. Biofuel requires modifications to engines to use. Renewable diesel works in any diesel engine.

- They've spent the past 15 years making the technology and revenue is finally starting to come in.

- They have proven they can desuphurize their fuel, which was one of the last risk factors for selling. Once they prove they can scale that up, this thing will move hard.

- They currently have plans to have 30 facilities up and running in 5 years. Right now they have one test facility while breaking ground on others.

- They have JV agreements for the first 9 facilities. After that they have stated they now have the money to fully fund further facilities on their own, making the margins much better.

Mortgage REIT with 10% quarterly book value growth since liquidating a majority of assets to cover collateral obligations at the inception of covid. 

Well insulated from corporate tax changes (given it is a REIT), and recurring dividend income provides liquidity for proactive portfolio realignment on more speculative stocks as the market continues to swing.

Long term strategy is to build a large collateralized annuity stream at an implied yield well in excess of 20% annually as the book value recovers on a 2 year horizon and dividends continue to increase in proportion to share price. 

Present value of discounted future cashflows assuming modest continued growth on a 5yr horizon shows the stock undervalued currently by roughly 50%.

2021-04-19 11:09:44,stocks,"I bought $INPX. (Just shy) of 500 @ 1.16. It has the potential IMO to break out this week.

Credit u/pd4106 for the DD below.

""This is a **SHORT/MEDIUM-TERM PLAY.**

Sysorex announced that they are entering a triangle reverse-merger with an ETH miner today. This has caused the stock to fly from under $1 to $9, with highs of $14 today.

That is HUGE news, but this is even bigger news for $INPX - **a large shareholder** in $SYSX. As of April 13th's market close, they owned around \~17.5m shares in $SYSX, valued at $17 million. **Today this is now worth $178m.** That's right, they have almost 10x'd this investment in Sysorex. The best part? INPX have a market cap of $110m and they are currently only up 12% today (current price is 1.23). The potential here is HUGE as this is a sympathy play off Sysorex which hasn't moved yet.""

In addition, they are currently drilling for gold and copper in Victoria and results are expected soon. If we get positive results then this stock is going to do very well.

This is a company i had followed before the infamous wallstreetbets was even a thing. It's something i believe in and heres why:   
\-During Covid, yet taking a massive hit due to film productions, they capitalized on streaming channels and pushing content to multiple platforms. This brought in record number Ad revenue to keep them running. (shows quick responsive behavior)  
\-Massive Debt Payments are being made, just back in march they put 3.5 mil down on a 10 mil debt and extended the duration til march next year. They are executing their aggressive debt payoff plan well.  
\-As the film industry opens back up more they will begin generating more content to sell ON TOP of ad revenue from their new found user base, (I am expecting higher revenue by end of year.)

On top of that, integrating vet services to their retail locations (can't order a vet from Amazon) in combination with already having grooming services helps retain in store customers, and offering delivery through door dash helps get them more in the online space. On top of that, general trends related to people and their pets have improved from a business side perspective since the pandemic."

Finally - the reason they are so cheap at the moment is 1) they are not yet listed on any US exchanges, but they've filed to be on NASDAQ, so expect to see that soon. 2) there are a lot of shorts on this stock (i read somewhere about 40%, but take that with a grain of salt).

2021-04-19 15:53:50,stocks,"It's not necessarily ""under the radar"" because it is a well-known company and merging with one of Chamath's SPACs, but it's still crazy how little publicity SoFi has gotten across the various investing subreddits and on Youtube. The fact that it is currently trading at a mere $16 a share pre-merger is the definition of ""real upside potential"" too. Companies that operate in a similar space include Affirm ($66), LendingTree ($220), and UpStart ($96). Hell, a company like Loandepot only does mortgages (one of many things SoFi does) and is stabilizing around $20 after its recent IPO. And if you're super-bullish on SoFi, you might put the company with the likes of SQ (I wouldn't go that far though).  

On the occasion that SoFi does receive proper coverage, a lot of the bullish takes echo Chamath's overly optimistic view of the company, which can be annoying. Those bulls think SoFi will radically alter banking, and the company's Galileo platform will be the ""AWS of FinTech."" 

However, we don't need to be that optimistic to have a bullish view of the company. SoFi is arguably the best and most reputable lending/refinancing FinTech company out there already. Go talk to anyone that refinanced their student loans and I guarantee either (1) they refinanced their student loans with SoFi, or (2) they barely ended up picking a different company but had a very positive experience with SoFi and would absolutely consider them for other things going forward. Do the same thing for someone who recently refinanced their mortgage. Overall, you'll find that SoFi has made a name for itself in customer service in a field where it is very common for people to harbor negative feelings towards their lender/refinancer. At the same time, SoFi actually does offer great rates, which will only get better once their banking charter goes fully into effect.

So I see a company with core products that lock their customers in for years/decades, thereby giving them ample ability to cross-sell their other products. And unlike other lenders in this space, SoFi *actually has* lots of other products to cross-sell. Even if some of these products fail, they still have their core products to fall back on for quite some time. Moreover, SoFi carries a very positive reputation that intrigues would-be customers. SPACs/Chamath aside, it's not hard to love SoFi as a company, and envision it trading much much higher than its current price."

I had Pen Inc. for twenty years (before it became Pen, I bought it as Applied Nanotech, they merged)

Bought for 200, was eventually force-sold by my broker for 6 because suddenly after no change at all (I wasn't an active trader, that could've been the reason), I was not capable to trade on the OTC market according to them so they had to sell it.

Needless to say, I changed brokers. Haven't bought it back as Nano Magic (again a name change) now has no stake anymore in Canon's SED monitors. I really hope Canon is continuing the development but I haven't followed it for years."

They are simply changing the form in which the carbon is bound, which at best would make them carbon-neutral.

Furthermore, a process that requires energy to actually take place can only be carbon-negative if the energy used for it was not made usable via a net increase in atmospheric carbon, which for most countries on this world is not the case.

2021-04-19 00:09:54,stocks,"I saved this one and so far this is the best comment I have read. I agree with what you wrote. This indeed does look undervalued from a quantitative perspective. The forward PE is low, the revenue growth is good and business seems to be good as usual. I personally don't own any pharmaceutical companies as I'm not very knowledgeable on the space. I'd love to hear more about this company though. Thank you so much for the comment!"
2021-04-19 00:11:48,stocks,VRTX is a banger. Me Ma was an EVP there snd helped bring that drug to market.

2021-04-19 07:45:42,stocks,what you think of SRPT
2021-04-19 09:33:12,stocks,"That looks like an excellent play!

Be aware that there are some in Congress that think that Big Pharma should be nationalized, that is, funding and profit controlled at the national level b/c Pharma does not produce rare disease drugs that are cheap enough.  I don‚Äôt personally think this will happen b/c drug lobbies are strong and money is still flowing freely, but monitor what is happening in insulin.  If Medicare takes over the insurance biz, and is allowed to negotiate drug prices, it will have a chilling effect on VRTX. Just something to add to your DD pile of concerns."

2021-04-19 10:08:04,stocks,"if you like pharma with no revenues take a look at PLXP. they've been approved for a 81mg and 325mg liquid version of aspirin which uses their drug delivery system. the special thing is that their system utilises lipids which prevents breakdown of the drug in the stomach and delays it until it hits the small intestine which improves absorption. 

FDA approval sent it from 7 to 17 but profit taking took it back to 8. they did an offering for 100m at 8 and its been creeping up ever since. 

they plan to push to market in q3 and they have a board which seems to have done this before with another drug called mucinex ."

Usually a good sign in my opinion when a company is investing to modernize"

2021-04-19 01:14:28,stocks,I got burned on the hype train. Took my losses. Not sure how I feel about it anymore. Glad I sold when I did ($10) but it seemed to be great value even at that price. I just bought for the hype so I wasn't willing to hold. In today's environment you need momentum more than a healthy balance sheet.

Definitely has growth potential. Im bullish on both AMD and INTC."

was under $50 as recently as January. It's not even late April and it's $67

it's not *that* cheap for a company facing existential threats from competitors with far better tech if it can't catch up

It's crazy undervalued and has so many resources. It's been a company screaming for a new CEO for a while and I like the hire. Same for IBM. And GE too although that's a bit longer back now. The old boomer names still have alot of business. I think people underestimate how quickly you can turn those types of companies around by M&A."

You can get better CPU from AMD, but you can not. And while as a consumer I'm still for the read team - I would probably buy an Intel today should I be in need of a new PC."

It was at 50, but now it isn't."
2021-04-19 08:40:44,stocks,"The issue with Intel is that they are losing server market share to AMD, and fast. They haven't done much in terms of consumer CPUs in 5 years, while AMD has crushed them. And now, Nvidia decides to get into the CPU market as well. I would only think about buying in when either the price drops more or they have strong improvements in either the GPU/CPU space."
2021-04-19 10:39:29,stocks,"INTC has yet to show they can reach modern process nodes (i.e. smaller transistors). They won't have 7 nm CPUs for two more years, and they will have to get the support chips made by TSMC.

I.e., they are limping and could be dead money for a while.

As for its competition, I still don't get what Lisa Su is doing buying Xilinx. The FPGA and modern core technologies will not merge easily. She's paying 7X what Hector paid for ATI, and that should have been a slam-dunk integration (but, being Hector, he utterly bungled it and it took 5X as long as it should have and the results were an abomination that cost the company its fabs, and he vanished with them). Meanwhile Ryzen is aging and they don't have design talent that can replace it the way Jim Keller dropped it on them to replace the old garbage. Radeon crypto sales are their real cash cow. So AMD is a question mark that just diluted shares due to vast goodwill in the XLNX takeover.

NVDA, however, has a rolling business in video, crypto, and AI, and has ideas in the pipe that will expand it significantly. The decision to target servers is all win. The ARM buyout will be a huge up if it goes through, and a small down if it doesn't (since the risk is currently baked in)."
2021-04-19 12:38:32,stocks,"INTC is NOT undervalued lmao. You might think it's undervalued because of the crazy valuation of tech stocks but their (INTC) current valuation is very fair. 

The time to get on the INTC train was 6 months ago when everyone was selling INTC in response to the M1 chip. Sad I didn't pull the trigger then but INTC currently **IS NOT ""UNDER THE RADAR""**

Edit: This guy downvoted me to get people to buy INTC so that he can sell LMAO üòÇ"
2021-04-19 07:01:06,stocks,I'm definitely going to wait a couple years before jumping on INTC.

At the same time, Corsair isn't doing a great job at marketing their products as a display of wealth or status like what Razer did while suffering from issues like low-profit margin and poor cash flow.

Maybe Corsair is significantly popular in North America, but outside of NA, Razer products are generally treated as the luxury brand."

All the stocks listed aren't suddenly going to have their value pumped because someone made a comment about it."

It is an archaic word.  Use '*greatly*' instead, and if that does not sound right then maybe chose a word that has a standard meaning, instead of a troubling political association.

"" *Bigly* is now rare, possibly nonstandard, and other words such as *greatly* are typically used instead. Many uses are associated with [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump), who in 2016 often used [*big league*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/big_league#English) unusually as an adverb, rather than a noun or adjective, which was widely misinterpreted as (and thus popularized) the term *bigly* ""

2021-04-19 14:38:28,stocks,"Sure! 

Origin's cost of timber feedstock ($.03 lb) is significantly lower than that of Danimer's canola ($.36), and is also lower than that of oil ($.18) although obviously that price goes up and down with oil. After all is said and done Origin is currently cost competitive with oil with all the additional benefits.

Origin uses chemical processing as opposed to fermentation like Danimer. 

Origin's PET plastic is chemically identical to current plastics on the market which means it immediately slots into existing recycling infrastructure, and can immediately drop-in to replace customer's existing products. There is no need to make extremely large capital investments. 

Danimer's advantage over Origin is that their plastic is biodegradable, however, their share price fell a week or so ago after it was disputed that it meets standards to be called biodegradable so that advantage might be disappearing. 

Origin are part owned by some of the biggest users of plastic on the planet (PepsiCo, Danone, Nestle). 

I think the biggest advantage is that Origin is a carbon negative product. Danimer uses about 30% less carbon than fossil fuels, but if it turns out their claim of biodegradable plastics isn't true then it takes away most of its value as a company. It costs more than oil, isn't recyclable, isn't a drop-in ready product that fits into existing infrastructure, etc. 

Hope that helps give you an idea on my thoughts on it!"
2021-04-19 15:04:55,stocks,Yes this is correct. They're billing themselves as carbon negative for that reason.

Wishing your family good health."
2021-04-19 00:14:42,stocks,"I appreciate your kind words. Glad you found value. Generally I like to be contrarian if I invest in individual stocks. If the market assumes the worst, we know the world doesn‚Äôt really deal in absolutes both positive or negative, and I‚Äôm willing to bet against the extreme sentiment. I‚Äôve made a lot of gains recently this way in everything from mall REITs to tech stocks. 

In VRTX and BMRN‚Äôs cases, I‚Äôm super bullish. Pharma companies get a bad rap, but their treatments save lives and improve QoL by a significant margin. VRTX has some data coming up from a study concerning a promising compound they have, so if you do your own DD and are still interested, you could initiate half a position now then wait and see. But if the news is positive it may very well be a rocket."
2021-04-19 00:17:48,stocks,"Wow that‚Äôs crazy. Yeah their CF treatments are in a class of their own. Reading patient testimonials is very emotional; aside from a cure that would likely require gene therapy, VRTX‚Äôs treatments give the ability to live a normal life. That‚Äôs remarkable and priceless."
2021-04-19 09:43:59,stocks,"I like it, but still think it can slide a bit from here. But generally fits similar profile to the names I list. Smaller market cap and thin volume with more short interest, so that can explain its path downwards. If it stabilizes around 70 I‚Äôd be curious to learn more."
2021-04-19 09:42:12,stocks,"Yeah, I appreciate the comment. Agree that it‚Äôs potentially a big problem, though I doubt the government wants to take a huge bite of that apple. I‚Äôd assign it high impact, but low probability. To a certain degree maybe all big pharma names reflect this danger, and I‚Äôm comfortable with it until something substantially changes. 

Another thing is VRTX and BMRN benefit from orphan drug status from the government. Even if they were to set price controls, ultimately someone will have to pay for the difference since the incentives to bring rare disease therapies to market are already low without orphan drug incentives. 

I would argue there are lower fruit to go after in the fruit tree than life changing treatments like VRTX offers. But the risk is definitely there."
2021-04-19 09:59:29,stocks,"No problem, glad my comment brought you value. Let me know what you think once you‚Äôve done your DD - curious to hear other takes."

2021-04-19 16:03:38,stocks,"Thanks for your comment. I‚Äôm just humbled that so many people have reached out and given their experience interacting with VRTX. It‚Äôs just a reminder that these aren‚Äôt just prices on a screen: real companies impacting real people everywhere.

2021-04-19 05:47:45,stocks,"Lol no .  Quite the contrary .  Biossance has blacklisted over 2,000 potentially harmful ingredients that aren't regulated by the FDA.  So in essence, they are a clean beauty products that the self regulated themselves .Their revenue from this alone has been growing over 100% last quarter and 65% YoY.  Their gross margins are over 50%.  

They already spent so much from R&D worth over $1.7 billion . The failed clean biofuel almost took them to the brink until they found their niche on clean beauty products.  But the molecule they produced, they can sell it to 50-100 million a piece.  Only constraint by their manufacturing plant and so they are building more.

They just secured a 600 million upfront partnership deal from their successfully scaling 13 of 13 molecule.

They have the MOAT that can revolutionize the synthetic biology.  Amyris' patented fermentation-based production method - That Yeast machine that makes the molecule.

This is high risk high reward type of play .  Most of their products are not on FDA radar.   From clean biofuels, cosmetics, makeups, baby brands and even cannabinoids etc.  The recent F&F deal with DSM and DSM exercises their warrants for dilution should solidify their balance sheet in their next earnings.

If they are able to complete their new plant in Brazil this year, they projected to be profitable by 2022.

I have been building up position .  Glad I did not miss their turn.  They managed to turn this around with Doerr backing.  The potential is there .  The only question is their execution."

What did I learn? What actually changed about these companies? Nothing. From non-legalisation to legalisation day all that changed was the environment. The companies still had to produce, sell, distribute. Did the fact that something they expected (legalisation) occured really didn't change the day to day business.

You suggested that it is not *that* cheap because the price has gone up from $50 to $65. That is a ridiculous way to value a stock. Pray tell, can something that has increased in price still be undervalued?

The day to day changes in a stock‚Äôs price that are not due to fundamental changes is called NOISE and there‚Äôs a lot of it.

2021-04-19 12:50:04,stocks,The average PE ratio of the NASDAQ is around 33. Which is about average compared if you look at 2016-2019 it was in the 50s to 90s. During the dot com crash it was around 150. I don‚Äôt understand people like you who say tech stocks are overvalued rn. You might as well say that tech stocks have been overvalued since the history of the NASDAQ. Also if you compare Intel to S&P companies it still has a lower PE value than the average. If you also do the intrinsic value metric if gives you a fair value of around $95.00 a share. So the math and metrics says its undervalued. FYI I entered a position into Intel when it was trading at around $45.00 a share but keep talking because you clearly know what you are talking about lol

Personally, I think the major car manufacturers are going to be the big winners in EV. I know NIO and some others have promise, but where they might have advantages in the technology used in their platforms, the big car companies still win on everything else: existing market share, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure, brand recognition, financial and corporate structures (remember that most big car makers also have financing divisions), marketing, etc."

QNX is currently so dominant, I don't see it being replaced anytime soon, especially now BB is making it even easier to host other OSs on it.

I suggest reading up on IVY, what it is and what value it brings. Please note that IVY is a joint project with Amazon, and currently AWS's most hyped automotive cloud solution.

As far as personal cost for the medication there is none at the moment due to making less than 45k a year. Since we found her diagnosis my wife could not work a regular job and I had to drop hours to make all of our monthly and weekly appointments. The cost of the medicine is actually cheaper than not having it in the long run. Without it you‚Äôre looking at many hospital visits and possible lung transplant.

2021-04-19 11:03:10,stocks,"What I said is sort of a joke lol and is pure speculation. But it‚Äôs based off this: 
https://m.imgur.com/a/ggIFTfQ

It‚Äôs a 15 page document that was leaked out of the estate of an American astronaut after he died. It‚Äôs basically a set of notes taken by a scientist who regularly works as a consultant to the Pentagon named Dr. Eric Davis about his conversation with a top ranking Pentagon official named Admiral Wilson that happened almost 20 years ago.

The admiral says he came across a special access, black budget program at the Pentagon headed by one of the top defense contractors which he doesn‚Äôt name  (I think it‚Äôs Lockheed Martin, specifically their Skunkworks division). He eventually arranges a meeting with the program director to find out more information and is told that the purpose of the program was to reverse engineer a craft they acquired that was ‚Äúnot of this Earth - not made by man - not by human hands‚Äù.

The admiral demands to have access to the program but is denied by the program director after he gets shown a list of people who do have access (no one from the Pentagon or even the rest of the government, not even the president, is on that list. Basically no government oversight.) Admiral Wilson goes all Karen and threatens to complain to his superiors about this and the program director is like ‚Äúlol go ahead‚Äù and when he does, he gets his career threatened and is told to never speak of it again.

If you‚Äôre doubting the authenticity of the document, it‚Äôs probably real: all of the people mentioned in it are real people. (Dr. Eric Davis was in a recent NYT article a few months ago. I wouldn‚Äôt doubt if the next article/bombshell about this topic that comes out is about this leaked document if they can verify it.) Whether or not the conversation took place or if what the program director told the admiral is real is up for debate.

Anyways long story short, if it‚Äôs true that Lockheed Martin has a UAV in their possession, $LMT is probably going to be a (very) long term hold, but who knows if they can actually reverse-engineer technology that is probably thousands (or even millions) of years ahead of us within our lifetimes."

Server - AMD was already stealing market shares from them, then Nvidia when announced Server CPUs and is now directly competing against them(which was why INTC dipped down from $67)

Networking - Intel was never the big guy in network processor development, the monopoly is split between Samsung and Broadcomm.

With that said, I bought the dip at $45 and still holding 500 shares after cashing out some at $65.

Long term, there are also signs that RISCV might become competitive with ARM in a couple of years, and at current growth rates it is likely that all chip makers are experimenting with that.

For the record I think the fair valuation of INTC is $52 a share. All these mumbo jumbo people are throwing around about what they are working on is just not realistic. Every big company has multiple ongoing projects, until I see results, I cannot, in good faith, claim that INTC is ""undervalued."""

The process Intel calls 10nm has similar transistor density to TSMC 7nm process (a bit better than their initial 7nm process, a bit worse than TSMC got after some refinement).

Their 7nm process is also supposed to be superior in that regard to TSMC 5nm. And I'm pretty sure it's actually supposed to be not far behind TSMC 3nm.

So, I'd say that if there are no more delays, Intel and AMD will be on pretty close to equal footing (probably slightly in favour of TSMC process on AMD side of things) on the manufacturing process front around 2023/2024."

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2021/03/22/just-the-facts-on-spacs/?sh=598570dd4fb4

>What Makes A SPAC An Attractive Investment?

>On the other side of the coin, SPACs can offer attractive asymmetry for investors. With valuations for the market, as a whole, near historic highs, buying SPACs at or near NAV can provide a favorable risk/reward. Because the SPAC holds in trust safe securities, its NAV should not deviate too far from $10, given the opportunity for arbitrage there. In other words, the downside may be limited. On the other hand, if investors become enthused about an announced deal, we are seeing SPAC shares trade well above NAV. Of course, as the share price increases above NAV, the cliched margin of safety declines, and the risk becomes more like that of any other stock.

>From one perspective, SPACs are seemingly more democratic than traditional IPOs, where investment banks control supply and retail investors are typically only able to transact at levels far higher than where the IPO is initially priced. SPACs, on the other hand, often (but not always) give retail investors a shot at owning a position closer to the $10 price."

2021-04-19 10:10:25,stocks,"A SPAC is less of a traditional ‚Äúcompany‚Äù and more of an investment vehicle.

The SPAC ticker AACQ which you would buy to invest in ORGN is simply an investment account where the value of the fund is typically equal to the stocks market cap. SPAC shares generally have an ‚Äúassumed‚Äù NAV of $10 since that is what your share is worth if the fund dissolved due to not being able to find a merger company. 

Once the merger takes place, the SPAC and the target company merge and the shares convert.

Playing SPACs used to be incredibly easy since everything was pumped on merger announcement. Now it is more challenging, I have been sticking to proven mgmt teams and near NAV plays."

No one knows for sure, just like with any company. There will be bears and there will be bulls. Personally, I'm bullish but honestly it'll depend on market sentiment. 

A similar but different company to compare to is DNMR if you'd like to take a look at what they've done. They did have the benefit of merging at the height of the SPACs, and there is no guarantee ORGN will replicate that on the same timeline. But I believe ORGN offers a far superior product and has a much higher potential."

For now the chinese Government is very interested in bitcoin because it is a shift from using the US dollar as a world currency. A significant percentage of bitcoin in mined in China alone. However US miners are beginning to dominate marketshare as well.

Look at what happened to Alibaba CEO, and the Alipay IPO, or the recent congressional bill of delisting Chinese stocks as US/China tensions grow.

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"How can I find trade opportunities outside of market hours? (Swing Trading) Hello,

The job I currently have really does not allow me to stay on top of things in the market, as I get out of work with only a few hours left in the day and it is difficult to check the news while I'm at work (However I *can* execute trades, if I have some planned). So I am left almost exclusively with having to conduct research outside of market hours in order to find a swing trade opportunity. 

I am pretty much just lost, I don't really know of many resources I can use to find near term catalysts like a demo day, planned speech, etc. I have heard people say, ""You don't need to monitor the market and the news all the time to be successful."" However, I honestly can't apply that to my own trading in a way that makes sense to me, take the recent MSFT rally for instance, news came out at 3:00PM about the contract, and the stock subsequently rallied. To me, you had to be there, you had to be stalking a news wire.

I try to use Finviz, and don't get me wrong, it is a fantastic scanner, but when I want to find catalysts and anticipate volatility in the short term, I just don't find it incredibly useful in that regard. I also go through EDGAR filings every night, but every time I find something notable, There's just a nice gap up to a subsequent selloff the next morning.

So how *can* someone in my position (which I presume to be a lot of people) reliably find trade opportunities without stalking the news? What specific sources do you use to first find a stock or event, and do research on said stock or event during after hours? 

I am absolutely aware that there is no such thing as a guaranteed trade, I am not asking for some ticket to beat the market, all I want are better odds and a plan."

I try to maintain a balance of 70% in long term, and the resulting 30% is devoted to frequent swing trades. I do admit it is a little risky of a ratio."
2021-04-18 23:12:39,stocks,I swing trade options. Only buy at close and sell at open the next day because of theta burn. Something like fubo up 20% in a day I‚Äôll buy puts on. Snap drop of 5% like last Friday a week before earnings I‚Äôll stock up on calls. Been working out pretty well. Could apply the same strategy to just stocks

2021-04-19 03:59:24,stocks,"Quarterly earnings reports are usually delivered before market open or after market close. 

Following that earnings report, the stock will usually take a wild swing up or down depending on how far away from analysts expectations the earnings reported are - the ""surprise factor"" (note, it is not as simple as earnings exceeded, stock go up)

Screener tools like [finviz.com](https://finviz.com) let you search which companies have an earnings report due today.

I've tried this strategy for day trading, but it's still very hard to predict which way things are going to go. The only thing you can be sure of is that the stock will move following an earnings report, which is what the parent commenter was saying."

2021-04-18 23:41:50,stocks,"My returns from swing trading have not been exactly exceptional thus far, but in my belief it's a skill that is honed in, and one can begin to recognize patterns and utilize different tools. So as of late, the effort expended to returns has been better on the long term side. But this ties in to why I made this post, I am trying to find ways to improve my returns with swing trading.

I am always evaluating and making necessary changes to how I approach the market. I went into it with only swing trading in mind, however, I found that if I had the majority of my money in long term investments, their returns could hedge against possible losses from a bad swing trade, and if I make a good trade, then I'm a happy man.

I do get alerts from various news sources, however I would like to figure out a way to identify stocks that I can expect volatility from in the short term without needing to respond to news asap."
2021-04-18 23:51:22,stocks,"I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm not a believer that day trading or swing trading is something where effort expended and skill acquired will lead to meaningful improvement in returns. Reason being, stocks can move for any reason or no reason in the short term. Prices are random in short intervals. So assuming you‚Äôre going up against similarly skilled ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù in the market, the only difference between outcomes is going to be luck (someone won the trade, someone lost). The market as a whole is filled with sophisticated and knowledgeable traders and investors. 

Just think about it for a second. Also, if you‚Äôre ‚Äúhedging‚Äù your swing trades with your long term portfolio, aren‚Äôt you just better off being 100% long term? Save yourself time and effort. Anyway you can feel free to disagree. I‚Äôve tried a lot of different strategies since I first started investing and I‚Äôve come to realize the only way to win long term is to just accept the market return. And you can focus on other things in life."

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Yet another wash sale question If I completely close out of a position that triggered a wash sale and never buy back in, will I be able to deduct the originally disallowed loss from the current tax year?

Buy 100 XYZ @ $100 on 3/1
Sell 100 XYZ @ $80 on 3/15
Buy 100 XYZ @ $70 on 3/20
Sell 100 XYZ @ $90 on 3/25
Buy 100 XYZ @ $100 on 3/26
Sell 100 XYZ @ $80 on 3/31

May have gone too crazy with the buys / sells but I‚Äôve bought back in to one stock quite a few times and have mostly sold at a loss. I‚Äôll be closing out of the position and won‚Äôt touch it for at least 30 days.

2021-04-18 22:04:32,stocks,"Yes, you can deduct them. The easy way to think about the wash sale rule is that if you sell the stock before December 1st and don‚Äôt touch it again in December then you‚Äôre good."

In your example, After the sale on 3/25 you had now broken even and wash sale is no longer in effect because that sale was not a loss. Then you lost 20/share on the 3/26 buy vs 3/31 sale. If you don't re-buy you can deduct the $20*100=$2000."

Should I just sell it and put it in VTI?

So Basically they are the same 

Canadian ETF:

VSP

USA ETF:

SCHD

&#x200B;

So I would like to buy VSP because its in my currency, CAD. But SCHD has better Dividend yield.

VSP has a 1.43% Div yield and SCHD has 2.82%. Should I just convert my CAD to USD and buy SCHD because of the dividend yield?  This is going to be a long term investment. 15 years+

* Healthy cash balance
* tons of opportunities for expansion
* strong partnerships with NFL, PGA, and more
* Forward facing consumer company, with more than 30 states that could become available to DKNG. It will be huge once sports gambling becomes legal in NY, CA, and TX

Do they have issues with putting up ‚Äú$X Million Guaranteed‚Äù contests and not breaking even if not enough people enter?

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Quick question with some background Assume that there‚Äôs a stock that has been shorted into oblivion and now here exist more shorted shares than actual total shares. Now the people who shorted the stock into oblivion need to buy back all the shares multiple times over. However, since the shares shorted were synthetic, there isn‚Äôt enough money to close out of the short positions. These people then go bankrupt and hand over the bill to the DTCC. Now there are rumours that the DTCC has insurance coverage up to $60 trillion, however there is no proof of that. So the only way the shorts could be covered is by printing more money. This could then lead to hyperinflation.

Now that brings me to my question. How does one protect themselves against hyperinflation? I know about investing in real estate, commodities and treasury inflation protected securities but is there something else that can be used as a hedge against hyperinflation?

Ps. Not here to discuss if the situation above is probable or not. For the sake of the conversation, let‚Äôs just assume that it‚Äôs very unlikely. Any advice is appreciated.

Edit: a user pointed out that I‚Äôm talking about the devaluing of the currency and not hyperinflation. Still have the same question tho"
2021-04-18 23:02:25,stocks,"When Money Died is a book that covers Germany and Austria during inflation/hyperinflation.  

The short answer is that hyper inflation (50% per month) is a political problem and destroys an economy.  If you're expecting hyper inflation then you're expecting many other bad things.

Plain old inflation is a different (easier) problem to hedge against."
2021-04-19 08:41:11,stocks,"The government does not print money to cover your bad trades.

If you lend your shares to someone who goes bankrupt, you lose your shares. You were being paid interest, ostensibly to cover that risk.

Whoever is allegedly making DTCC pay insurance premiums on $60T in coverage is an insurance-salesman god. Because DTCC didn't need it. DTCC requires up-front collateral to be deposited with them when a transaction is created; that's their risk coverage. And they increase the rate when they see crazy trading in a stock.

So there's no way a short frenzy leads to hyperinflation.

The way to avoid the risk of hyperinflation is to avoid holding the cash that's being hyperinflated away. Buy anything *that isn't cash-settled or valued on cash.* You'll be part of the problem, but only momentarily."

Medium to heavy duty vehicles such as trucks, buses and ships need a fast refuelling system and a much larger energy storage than lithium based batteries can provide while being weight efficient. Herefore they are going to be using hydrogen in the future.

Therefore both technologies have their place."

Ships and planes need to be light though, which is where hydrogen comes in nicely. You can get a ton of energy into a hydrogen cell ship, and without the weight of dense batteries. Same with planes. Plus, batteries need to get away from limited resources just like fuel cells do. 

I think we will likely see a mix, with hydrogen fuels dominating shipping and batteries in consumer cars/ public transportation. Neither one can solve the problem alone. Invest in both!"

Also, you don't use gas of diesel for welding, but you can use hydrogen:

Speculation on the valuation of alibaba is really coming from a material impact to their business model. Previous to the last 6 months alibaba was an ‚Äúunregulated‚Äù company who used monopoly like tactics in its e-commerce and financial services products. 

With the recent news, the government seems to be going after both its e-commerce and financial services products. E-commerce will need to change to allow for smaller competition. Financial services will likely need to begin being regulated by a financial regulator. The question on future value is really do you believe the Chinese government will follow through on its threats and to what extent."

I own a bunch of BABA and think it is one of the best large cap investments in the world right now. Whenever someone responds about not investing in Chinese companies and they‚Äôre all a scam throw Charlie Munger back at them.

It‚Äòs a judgement call. The communists are willing to make decisions that could quickly change the value of this stock. Also, the accounting practices in China leave something to be desired. The communists have the means, motive and opportunity to cook the books for decades and we would never know.

Then there is the geopolitical issues. Another war with Vietnam or war with the Philippines. The invasion of Taiwan or even just destroying their ability to manufacture chips could quickly turn into WW3 or an embargo at the least. North Korea could go nuke and who knows how that could affect the company.

I don‚Äôt think those issues are simply dismissible. But I do believe its possible to make an investment in the company but someone should consider these issues beforehand."

1. If the United States could actually legislate so that:
   1. The US had universal health care, or at least a public option
   2. The US punished companies that under-hire people so as to avoid paying benefits like retirement, etc, by taxing them more than they save by the dodge
   3. The US stood up for unions and allowed walmart employees the protection to organize and collectively bargain

I think that Walmart would be on an even playing field with other companies, like Kroger, Sprouts, Costco, Target, Trader Joe's, etc, in terms of payroll/taking advantage of the US government .

IF these things were to happen, what edge does walmart have? Walmart would have the same goods. If people want to buy in bulk, they go to costco. if they want to buy produce, they can buy it cheaper and fresher on average at sprouts. If people want ready-made meals, sprouts or trader joes. Target has a better ambiance. Winco has off-brand low prices and is employee owned.

Walmart can consistently undercut their competitors because they are less scrupulous, and because of their huge volumes nationwide. My argument is that if they were no longer allowed to be less... humane... Walmart would fall over time to competitors, due to being perhaps less agile and lower quality.

This is what I wish would happen. But the number 1 thing is that the united states left needs to be able to legislate, which is a pipe dream in the current political climate."

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"With the recent dip in crypto prices across the board, tomorrow may be a great opportunity to buy Coinbase shares For some reason, cryptocurrency values all dropped overnight. Bitcoin for example went from $61,000 to $51,000 just yesterday and is currently trading at $56,000.

These types of dips are not uncommon in the cryptocurrency world, and anyone who has been trading crypto for the last few years can attest to the volatility of crypto.

In the equity market however, these types of drastic price changes are not commonplace and typically signify some sort of impending disaster for a company. 

Given that COIN has been trading on the stock market for less than a week and that many people were already weary of how closely the price of COIN is tied to Bitcoin and the recent attention, both good and bad, to cryptocurrency, I suspect that there will be many people dumping their COIN stocks tomorrow and the price could be hit hard. Many investors may not be used to such massive price swings and may be regretting buying the company.

Personally, I don‚Äôt see this as a major deal, and I think the price of bitcoin will recover within the next month or two, and coin will as well.

Bitcoin prices routinely fluctuate like this, and this is the first time it‚Äôs happening since COIN went public. The next time this happens people won‚Äôt react to it quite as strongly, so I see this as a possible buying opportunity since this price may drop the most this time around.

2021-04-19 00:00:00,stocks,"How much cash to hold? 
Hello everyone! 

Coming to the internet for a bit of a resource here.

Background: currently 24 with a full time IT sales gig, making decent money. Recently signed a lease to move in July for $985 a month. 

Financial state: Have a Roth IRA which I have already maxed out for the year. Currently have $24k in there invested into VOO, AAPL, MSFT, FUBO (questionable one I know) and ARKG. I also have an emergency fund built with Goldman Sachs with $10k in it. Additionally I have a standard account with $4k in it which I‚Äôve used as a way of investing into riskier stocks and have fell on my face here in terms of losses.

My main question/input I‚Äôm looking for from you all is how much cash is too much to hold? I‚Äôm a big believer of making my money work for me. I currently have $15k sitting in my checking account doing nothing. Should I put another $6k-$10k into my individual account? Obviously trying to transition my moves into more mutual funds and ETFs so I don‚Äôt get caught chasing short term plays."
2021-04-18 22:21:09,stocks,"you're only 24..relax bud! you have a much better head start than majority your age. 15k cash isn't that much anyway.

no need to rush to invest it..just put more and more slowly in. stop looking at your portfolio. enjoy life more..you're way ahead at this point and i'm sure you will succeed in life at this rate."
2021-04-18 20:54:36,stocks,"6 months of your cost of living at all times. That‚Äôs what I aim for, though my investment loss chasing has me really straddling the line.

6 months of expenses is good because it gives you a very nice buffer if you suddenly find yourself out of work, and it‚Äôs a decent size if there are any emergencies where you need cash on hand.

That‚Äôs my minimum. Once you hit that I think keeping 20% of your savings in cash is a good number in case any investment opportunities come up."
2021-04-18 22:29:26,stocks,"I'm gonna get downvoted for making sense here but you should have like 20% of your portfolio in cash assuming you're young with good income. Market corrections DO happen, and having almost everything invested is a great way to lose a ton of capital. Also it's good to have cash on the side for when downturns do happen, if you want to buy back in cheaper. If 100% of your portfolio is invested then what happens when a stock you believe in loses value? Absolutely nothing because you don't have cash to buy more with."

2021-04-19 03:31:31,stocks,"Take a look at [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) , and the useful flowchart linked to from that page.

You should hold 6-12 months of living expenses in either an HYSA or in i-series savings bonds, or similar zero-risk instruments.   Yes, you will not make as much on this as in the market, but you can think of this as an insurance policy against anything life throws at you.

It is not uncommon for the stock market to tank at just the wrong period.   Think about what happened this time last year - lots of people out of work \*and\* the market taking a dive.

The cash is so you don't go backward, even in bad periods.    If you don't have this, it is not uncommon to end up in debt you then have to dig yourself out of, which puts you on the wrong side of the interest/capital gains equation.

At some point, you can reduce this, but it's only after you have multiples of your annual expenses in your taxable portfolio.   

Now, as far as how much cash to keep uninvested (once you've allocated the cash to investments instead of savings), the correct answer is zero.   You want it working as much as possible as long as possible.   But, I'm an index fund investor which basically never sells anything so it's all about being in the market as long as possible for me."
2021-04-18 20:15:42,stocks,"I agree with u/provoko. Your emergency fund can play a few different roles, such as replacing a water heater that blows up in the middle of the night, leaking roof, or any other major expense that comes up unexpectedly. The main reason for 3-6 (or more) months is to keep you afloat if you suddenly find yourself with no income, such as losing/leaving your job, getting laid off, contract expiring, etc. The idea is to have cash immediately available and enough of it to pay for your monthly bills while you get back on your feet.  People that don‚Äôt have an emergency fund will start using credit cards or take out 401k loans and put themselves in a bad financial position. 

I just turned 40, and my wife also works, but we budget off of 1 income, so if either of us loses our job, we won‚Äôt have to touch any savings to stay afloat. We do still have about $25k in an emergency fund, in case the worst case scenario happens and we both lose our jobs, but also because even major home repairs like a brand new roof will seldom cost more than 15-25k."

2021-04-19 06:54:45,stocks,"We think similarly.

I like having cash on hand to buy bargains but I think 20% is too large. It‚Äôs sitting there doing nothing. I like 10% but even then I look at that mule sitting in the shade. At the same time I hate selling stuff so I can buy other stuff.

I‚Äòm not to worried about keeping cash so I don‚Äôt lose more during a correction. If I‚Äôm doing it right, my investments won‚Äôt drop as much, and will recover quickly, in a correction or even a bear market. I was able to sell a third of my portfolio in a week so I can always raise cash if I need it.

I finally had a rich guy problem., I have money but I don‚Äôt know what to do with it. I anticipated the last correction and sold about a third of my profile to take profits and then started to purchase in the new rotation stocks. It‚Äôs hard to find quality investments so I still have about 10% I want to spend. I want to get that cash into play because I believe this year will be a good one.

I don‚Äôt know it wise but I count the cash in my brokerage account as part of my emergency fund. I can get it relatively quickly and most emergencies can be covered by my savings account.

All said, I want to keep about 10% as cash In the brokerage accounts."

2021-04-19 03:22:22,stocks,"If you can't save this much, you have no business investing.  I don't necessarily agree that 24 months is needed in a savings account or i-series bonds (12 is more reasonable at the high end, and I usually say 6-12 months).   

But there is an order of things.   Long term investing (other than getting the 401k match at work if it's available) comes after all but the lowest-interest-rate (<4%) debt is paid off and you have a big enough emergency/savings fund that you're paying for everything with cash, and never have to use the credit card for living expenses, even when a job loss or something else unexpected happens.

Very rarely will someone get ahead if they do this out of order.

Don't let it stress you out though, save a minimum of 3 months, don't even invest if you can't save min 3 months worth of expenses.

My point to pick this up, is that I often find this advice really strange, knowing that I am in what I consider an on financial situation and I'm in the minority. A loooooot of people don't even have savings, and I agree that if you don't have any you shouldn't invest, but at this point we are at a point (and always have been probably) where investment is limited only to people that have the means, and that only furthers all of the inequality in society.

I understand what you say about cash earned always flowing in. A larger reserve makes it easier for me to manage that cash flow. My portfolio is probably not as dependable as yours.

By saving up cash for the next year,  you'll have a resource that many don't have.  And you will have this resource for the rest of your life, as long as you live within your means.   Yes,  the balance will go up and down as time goes on and SHTF,  but since you've chosen to live frugally, even if you have to rely on this for an emergency you will quickly rebuild it after the emergency is past, and you won't have had to pay anyone for the privilege of using their money.

First

How much of my portfolio should be invest in ""guaranteed"" growth? (stocks that consistently grew in the past 1-2 years)

Second 

Should I be looking into options as a beginner? How much experience would you guys recommend before doing more advanced trading?

Since then this stock has surged almost 60%, including an epic 15% jump last Friday when the housing starts numbers were published and showed massive increase in construction since February; which I said it would a month ago.  

I‚Äôve been getting a lot of messages recently asking if this stock is still worth buying or what‚Äôs my PT.  I am not going to suggest a PT or tell anyone whether they should buy this stock or when to sell if they bought it.  Everyone has their own risk tolerance and investing style.  

However, I am willing share the main data points (positive and negative) that I have so far focused on which will explain why I haven‚Äôt sold any of my shares yet, nor plan to in the next few weeks.  If you see flaws in the data/analysis, please share.  I am not a financial analyst.  I can‚Äôt give you advice.  I am just going to share with you why I am still sticking with this stock.  

**Brief History Description**

If you want a brief history description on this company, you can go to [my old DD on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m8tj0f/dd_on_rfp_a_lumber_value_play_poised_to_have_its/)

The only thing I will add: here‚Äôs a [very recent interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-04-15/lumber-prices-are-rising-like-i-have-never-seen-before-stinson-dean-video) from a lumber distributor/trader giving a good interview on why lumber is so high, and will continue to be high for a while.  If you look at analyst projections for the major homebuilders, like LEN, DHI, TOL, etc‚Ä¶ they all expect the homebuilders to see continuously increasing earnings for this year and 2022.  If they plan on building like crazy for the foreseeable future, that‚Äôs great news for companies like RFP.

**Present Day Conditions**

YTD RFP is up 126% and 812% for the year.  As with any stock, the higher it climbs, the more you should expect resistance (little dips) from profit taking.  There may be a dip on Monday after last Friday‚Äôs insane rally.  When I posted in March that this was an undervalued stock, there were many people saying the lumber surge was over and the stock had peaked.  They were wrong :). Now let‚Äôs look at what‚Äôs changed in the last 30 days now that the stock is up 60% since then.

**Bear Case Considerations**

I want to start with possible downsides to consider.  First, this stock is almost now trading at its 5 year high  (Current price ‚Äì 14.78; 5-year High was 15.50 in 2018).  The stock hasn‚Äôt traded in the 20s and 30s in over a half a decade.  So expect more turbulence and resistance on the way there.

Second, this is a cyclical stock.  Cyclicals do great until they don‚Äôt.  This stock will likely start a decline right before the decline in earnings shows up in an earnings statement.  A great analogy for exit strategies on cyclicals is: You want to leave the party while you‚Äôre still having fun.  To see a great example this, look at RFP‚Äôs stock price trajectory in Fall 2018, right before it‚Äôs Q3 earnings announcement on November 2, 2018.  Q3 was its best earnings for the year, but the stock was already declining from its 52WK high because lumber and wood pulp prices were crashing prior to that November announcement.  

Third, the trailing PE is now ~135.  So there is absolutely some futures earning priced in at this point.  However, for reason‚Äôs I‚Äôll explain later, this PE is very misleading because of an accounting quirk from Q4 2020. 

Four, dimensional lumber already has surged over 300% to ~ $1200-1300 MBF in the cash markets.  While those prices may surge a tiny bit more in the next couple months, it‚Äôs highly unlikely that there will be much more growth in price; a very important consideration for a cyclical stock.

Fifth, who the heck knows what Covid still has in store, if anything.  There was a recent lockdown order for Ontario (where some RFP facilities are) due to a spike in Covid cases.  Things like this could cut into RFP‚Äôs bottom line.  Hard to say how much if at all.

Sixth, they still have some pension liabilities that need to be paid for and will certainly mute the full impact of earnings (meaning less re-investment or less dividend potential) until these liabilities are fully paid off.  These pension liabilities could be a major factor decreasing the perceived fair value of the stock in the eyes of the institutional investors/HF‚Äôs.

**Why The Bear Case Doesn‚Äôt Scare Me Yet**

1)	I like Peter Lynch‚Äôs perspective that past performance doesn‚Äôt guarantee future performance.  800% growth doesn‚Äôt mean it will stop growing nor does it mean the stock will continue to grow.  What matters is whether the future earnings coming down the road justify further growth.  If they do, stay the course.

2)	While the pattern of cyclicals means there will be a peak and a drop from that peak, what‚Äôs different with this particular company is that it was trading at ridiculous lows, and if they finish paying off their debt this year (which I think they will), that combined with the improvements they‚Äôve made in 2020 and 2021, the resting run rate of this stock has a good chance of being higher than it was before this cycle started.  If it does, and you ask me how much higher will than normal run rate be? I have no fucking clue.  Anyone who claims to is talking out of their ass. 

3)	The trailing PE is high, and a good portion of Q1 earnings is priced in, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fully priced in for two reasons.  First, in Q4 RFP did an $80 Million writeoff for the idling of two newsprint mills‚Äîa one-time accounting expense that wasn‚Äôt a literal cash expenditure‚Äîwhich put them in the negative for that quarter and a EPS of 10 cents for 2020.  *If you remove that write off, their current PE would be in the ballpark of 13-14.*  

Second, Q1‚Äôs average projected EPS is $1.66.  I think they will beat it, but let‚Äôs say they don‚Äôt.  Then the trailing EPS will be $1.77 and give you a PE of 8.3 at the current price.  If you go for the adjusted PE that doesn‚Äôt include the writeoff, that would make the trailing EPS about ~$2.77 which would give an adjusted TTM PE of 5.33 at current price.  So, either way the company is still undervalued when Q1 earnings gets added in.

4)	Dimensional lumber will probably hit its peak in the next couple months.  That being said, because of what‚Äôs driving this massive surge in prices (massive growth in housing construction and remodeling), unlike in 2018, I don‚Äôt think the price will drop fast after it hits the peak.  Consistent with that, if you look at [dimensional lumber futures here]( https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/lumber-and-pulp/random-length-lumber.html#), you can see that the futures market right now is expecting lumber to stay 2-3x it‚Äôs 2019 price for the rest of year, and possibly into 2022.

**Current Valuation Metrics compared to other Lumber Players**

Even with the awesome rally in the last month, here‚Äôs RFP valuation ratios

    RFP
    P/E			    135
    Forward P/E		3.86
    Price/Sales		  .42
    Price/Book		1.19
    Price/Cash flow	6.57

Now let‚Äôs compare RFP‚Äôs ratios to similar forestry/lumber producers (WFG, WY, LPX, IFSPF and CFPZF) ([Link to screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/syWoh0F)):

    Forestry/Lumber Avg
    P/E			      15.2
    Forward P/E		  10.1
    Price/Sales		  2.1
    Price/Book	       4.4
    Price/Cash flow	  11.4
		
Takeaways: 1) RFP *still* has the best forward PE, price-to-sales ratio, price-to-book ratio. 2) It has the highest trailing PE, but again, if you remove the newsprint mill write-off, it is actually sitting right below the average, 3) Interfor and Canfor have slightly better price-to-cashflow, but RFP is substantially better than WY, WFG, and LPX.  Overall, RFP still has the best overall ratio picture and best forward-looking position, even after this 60% rally.

**The Bullish Case for 2021**

I am not going repeat what I wrote in the last post.  To see the things I listed to support a bull case a month ago, [here‚Äôs the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m8tj0f/dd_on_rfp_a_lumber_value_play_poised_to_have_its/)


*Future Lumber outlook has dramatically improved but analysts haven‚Äôt yet accounted for it.*

Myself and other RFP longs have been banging our heads for months now, because the 4 analysts who cover RFP so far still refuse to acknowledge the complete reality of the surge in lumber prices.  [Here‚Äôs a snapshot of average analyst quarterly EPS projections for 2021]( https://imgur.com/a/qepFiqC).  If you look up the other lumber stocks, they make all the same projections of mediocre Q2 and then Q3/Q4 dropping off hard.  

The issue is that the avg lumber price for Q1 will probably fall in the ballpark of 800-950.  (Remember there is a 9% duty for the lumber produced in Canada).  However, the avg price for Q2 will absolutely be over $1000 MBF.  So profits from lumber should be higher in Q2 than Q1.  And given the volume and price surge for the futures in the Q3 months (July futures currently trading over $1100 MBF), Q3 will almost certainly have a higher EPS than Q1, much less the current analysts‚Äô projections for Q3.

Also, by end of June, RFP‚Äôs three US mills they bought in 2020 should be running at full capacity according to the last earnings transcript.  At full capacity they increase the companies lumber production by ~25%.  So this only further adds to the extra sales/profit to be expect after Q2, compared to Q1.

**But here‚Äôs a decent way for you to do your own math for the value of the lumber segment:**

For RFP, assume $400 costs USD. There may be a few other costs to factor in, but not that much. May be $50 for longer shipping distances or whatnot. So, at $1000 MBF, you get about $500 cash margins.  At $1200 (which is still lower than the current cash price) you get $700 cash margins.

RFP will probably produce around 2.5 billion feet of lumber, so prices of $1000 per thousand feet let‚Äôs you do the math. I‚Äôd use a lower realization given the duty and we don‚Äôt know yet how Q4 will look.  So let‚Äôs call it $900 avg for year. So that roughly gives us margins of $450 USD per thousand feet on 2.5 billion of feet. So that‚Äôs **$1.12B in cash earnings ‚Äî or about $14/share ‚Äî for 2021.**  Depreciation/Amortization should take a chuck of that away so I don‚Äôt think that will be pure GAAP net income.  But still, pretty decent for a stock currently valued at $14.78, or a market cap of 1.2 billion.  *And that‚Äôs just the lumber segment.*  

So for those wondering if the party is over, ask yourself, how many companies are likely to produce their current market cap in EBITDA in the next year from just *one* of their business segments‚Ä¶? Food for thought on the current valuation. : )


*But Wait, there‚Äôs More!*

Putting aside all the cash the lumber segment is printing, the Paper and Pulp sectors also appear to be doing well and likely will boost profits in Q2/Q3, at a minimum.

Unfortunately, the current prices of paper and wood pulp are much more opaque and harder to preemptively track.  However, there are some limited free resources out there and they seem to show upward trajectory starting at the beginning of Q1 and continuing to grow in Q2, which means we should expect higher Paper/Pulp profits in Q2, and Q3 if trend holds.  Since it is harder for me to figure out all the drivers of this surge (beyond economy reopening and China‚Äôs ban on non-degradable single-use plastics), I don‚Äôt have the confidence to look beyond Q3 for now on these two areas.

In terms of what I use to try and get a feel for these two areas: 

1)	The closest thing to a futures market indicator for pulp. ([Shanghai Futures Market]( https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21/futures-prices))  The value is in yuan so you have to convert the currency yourself.  It is a relatively recent and speculative market, but it so far has generally done a decent job of acting as a mirror of the general wood pulp market.  As long as these futures are up, that‚Äôs a decent indicator of what‚Äôs currently going on in pulp world generally.

2)	There are couple of analysts who give little tidbits when companies, including RFP and its competitors, announce price increases on pulp. [I follow this editor]( https://twitter.com/bryansmithrisi?lang=en).  I don‚Äôt pay for his service.  But if you scroll through his feed (or search twitter for the terms ‚ÄúNBSK price‚Äù and ‚ÄúSBSK Price‚Äù you‚Äôll see his tweets in the last few months announcing price increases to RFP‚Äôs two main types of pulp in the last few months, both by RFP and its competitors. If you do that, you‚Äôll see big price increases being announced, many of which are effective during Q2.  So I expect Q2 and beyond to do better than Q1 in those areas as well.

3)	For Paper, this one is the hardest.  This was a [recent article]( https://www.specialtyprintcomm.com/blog/paper-market-update-paper-prices-continue-increase/) that talks about the type of paper RFP produces and that indicates prices are going up.  But beyond that, as the economy opens back up, paper profits are expected to increase from 2020 levels.  So I think this will get better over the next few quarters, compared to last year.  

Overall, it‚Äôs hard to say for sure what this means for true earnings for the year, but in terms of how I am planning my own exit strategies on this stock, I think there are major upward revisions coming to analyst projections after Q1 Earnings on April 29 and probably again during the summer, largely because lumber‚Äôs historically increased price probably isn‚Äôt going away any time soon.   


*RFP has a major additional earnings booster hiding in its financials which aren‚Äôt reflected in the valuation metrics but will be in the next few quarters*

Here‚Äôs an awesome nugget I recently realized that isn‚Äôt reflected in the valuation ratios, but I think it will help propel the book value/EV of RFP‚Äòs earnings and the ultimate EPS.

Here‚Äôs [a screenshot of RFP‚Äôs 2020 10-K, specifically it‚Äôs deferred tax assets]( https://imgur.com/a/tzwjlhM).  If you don‚Äôt know what a deferred tax asset is, especially loss carryforwards, google it or watch a Youtube video on it.  If you don‚Äôt know what valuation allowance, it‚Äôs **very important** you look it up to understand this bit.  

Essentially, because of the massive losses RFP sustained over the last decade while it transformed itself, it has over $800 million dollars in loss carryforwards and tax credits which it can use to pay virtually no taxes on the likely 100s of millions of dollars in earnings it will generate in the immediate future.  

Here‚Äôs the real critical point, those carryforward losses largely aren‚Äôt reflected in the book value/enterprise value of the company because of that 774-million-dollar valuation allowance which was essentially a write off of those deferred tax assets. 

Meaning, as RFP starts to generate more earnings, some of that valuation allowance will likely be undone, so that the loss carryforwards can be used, and when it does, the reversal of those valuation allowances will look like extra earnings/EPS on the books. Meaning, if they remove $160 million of VA to account for the use of the same DTA‚Äôs to avoid paying taxes on 2021 earnings, that will look like an extra $2 EPS for 2021.  Given that the current enterprise value is only 1.63 billion, if the total valuation allowance was reversed tomorrow that would cause an immediate increase in their enterprise value of  47% and would look like a net income of $9.69 EPS‚Ä¶.

RFP probably isn‚Äôt going to do it all at once but that gives you a sense of the scale of net income that will be added to RFP‚Äôs books in the coming quarters/years as they generate profits and RFP removes the valuation allowance negating the book value of the DTAs they previously wrote-off.


*If the Canadian Lumber tariff is removed, this would result in an instant windfall for RFP.*

I‚Äôve been asked how the politics of the tariff could affect RFP.  The answer is, it would be incredible for RFP if the tariff is removed. Right now, pressure is building from the homebuilders associations and from Canada to have the US remove the 9% tariff on Canadian lumber. I have no clue when or if this will happen and won‚Äôt speculate on that issue.

BUT, if the tariff is removed, RFP gets all the money it has set aside to pay future duties.  At end of Q4, that was $243 million ([See Page 4 of their 2020 10-k]( https://www.resolutefp.com/uploadedFiles/Investors/Financial_Reports/2020_10-K_Resolute-RFP.pdf?v=1)). That comes to just over $3 of EPS, which is quite significant given that the average analyst projection for net income for the year is $4 EPS‚Ä¶ 

**TLDR**: This stock has been kicking ass for a reason and I think will continue to do so.  I can‚Äôt predict the future, but I haven‚Äôt sold a share yet and will continue to keep a majority of my portfolio in this stock for the next 1-2 quarters *at a minimum,* because of the massive earnings they are/will be generating.  I don‚Äôt think the true future earnings of 2021 are priced in yet by analyst PTs or the current stock price.

Note:  I am not a financial advisor/analyst.  Please do your own research and make your own decisions if this company is under or overvalued.  I am sharing my thoughts with you because the mainstream financial media gives dogshit advice on how to invest in lumber.  

I‚Äôm long RFP in both shares and long term calls.  Don‚Äôt ask me for a PT, I‚Äôm not gonna give you one.  Don‚Äôt ask me if you should buy it, when you should buy it or when you should sell it.  You have to make those decisions for yourself."

Not a criticism, but I wonder if your grandfather just bought anything that he used, or if he bought things that he kept on buying in his life. For example, he may have bought heinz stocks because he will buy their ketchup over and over for years to come. You bought CD Project Red game once or twice, but you might not keep on buying their release over and over for years to come.

I don't go by the 'buy what you use school of thought', but I do like the concept because it saying you believe in the quality of the product for the cost so you could trust that the company will grow(P.S. also their marketing is good because you learned about he product). But that thought only works if you believe the quality of the product is consistently good.

Maybe for the CD Project Red you bought games from them and you liked it and you planned on buying the Cyberpunk, but you didn't have any plans on buying anything from them after that. Then the cyberpunk release should have been your exit time since there was no more future purchase in plans for you. Or if you have another game you know you will buy but nothing after that then that next game will be the exit point. You only buy and hold  as long as you purchase from them, but when the purchase stops you also let the stocks go.

A 3000 dollar a month payment making 50,000 a year. I looked into buying and I ran the numbers and knew in 2 months I would be screwed. So I waited. People were remodeling and buying cadillacs and spending like crazy. Others were doing cash out refinancing on homes they had.

Then it crashed. In months it turned into an absolute wasteland. Scorched  earth. Dozens of homes empty, block after block ,city after city, county after county. The banks would throw people out only to leave them empty for a year or more rather than taking a lower payment.  Now magnify this state wide. Nationwide.  Globally.  

I waited and then started looking for a home.  Scared to buy because in a neighborhood of 20 homes maybe 5 were occupied.  Block after block .City after city. . I looked at about 100 bank owned homes.

I said I would never buy one because of someone else's loss. But it really didn't matter. They had been out of it for a year. Long gone.

So I offered them what they wanted and.the appraisal was lower so they took less. I thought what the fuck . You don't care about the loss. They were just writing it all off. They knew they were getting bailed out.

If the market crashed 30% tomorrow, I‚Äôd start buying:
*75% of cash deployed into different indices - sp500, small cap value, large cap value, intl index, total market index, etc 

*25% of cash deployed into individual stocks for the long term 

Everybody‚Äôs horizon is different and so is risk tolerance.  This is what I‚Äôve found has worked for me - I‚Äôm happy w the return and I can sleep at night not wondering if I invested in the right stuff (I.e. individual stock risk vs index fund risk)"

So I bought every day the indices were down more than 1% in addition to my usual weekly buying, and I accelerated the amount bought as the market went further into bear market territory.  Invested all my free cash in the span of 2 months, and it paid off.   

Even then, there‚Äôs still lessons to learn - I could have taken on more risk with some tech names that went up 4-8x since last year, but I guess I‚Äôll remember that for the next recession lol.  I made money and beat the indices so I can‚Äôt complain, but there‚Äôs always room for improvement"

2021-04-18 22:55:45,stocks,"Extensive back testing shows that optimal stock allocation for index investors is more like 200% stocks (meaning leveraged up 2:1) when young, tapering down when you near retirement. At 35 allocation would still be close to 200%. Consider if you are only at 100% stocks, your allocation may be too low, not too high.

The book Lifecycle Investing lays this all out.

Rather than selling stocks and holding cash, an alternative method may be to keep your stocks, wait for the next 30% pullback and then take a leveraged position. Deep ITM long dated call options are probably the cheapest and easiest way to get leverage. So if you owned 100 shares of SPY you would sell it and buy 2 calls for Dec 2023 around the $210 strike. For the same money you now control 200 shares. The effective interest rate for the 2:1 leverage is well below 1%."

Since these hedgies shorted the stock into negative beta of -1.82, meaning that there is a strong inverse relationship with the SPY. So as the SPY (and the market) goes down, GME will strongly go up and when the squeeze happens. I personally believe it will cause a market crash since the worlds 2nd biggest market maker (citadel) just got smashed for shorting GME. And all of their positions in all other stocks will probably get liquidated and used to pay off the apes. Thus a mass sell off on all these other stocks"

2021-04-19 10:18:10,stocks,"Can confirm. I was new, starting many of my core stock investments this year by late January. The correction was getting dicey so I considering trying to preserve some of my capital by selling a few positions and buying back later. Low and behold, right as I did that, things almost immediately rebounded and I found myself having to quickly rebuy a load of crud and destroy my cost basises in process. A similar thing almost happened to me with crypto during the February correction. Somehow gloriously timed selling the bottom and had to rebuy instantly while begrudginly throwing extra money in to compensate to not get destroyed. When folks time the top, it more often than not is just dumb luck and chances are if they try to do it the same way in the future, they'll eventually get burned cause the market just can't be predicted. 

I have been selling some stuff here and there the past month but that's largely a dilligent, ongoing effort on my part to rebalance my portfolio into something I am more willing to stick it through with no matter how nasty things get. In the short time I've been seirously investing on my own, every time I try to ""time the market"", I get it wrong. My best performing assets have the ones that I've timed the least and just largely sat on. My managed Roth started last October that I've only added once too? Considerably up. Individual account I had my advisors start for me in January not too long before my own Fidelity account? Back in the green. My long crypto portfolio that I've now made a point to touch as little as possible? Up quite a bit.

My biggest losses have come from purchases I tried to time the bottom on and failed or hyped up crap on Reddit that I probably shouldn't have bought in the first place since i didn't know lick abou the tickers and they were overbought. I've been realizing I'll only get the most consistent success by not only keeping a reserve of cash at all times but continuously adding into picks I myself believe and not trying to get too fancy with them. I am now trying to make a side cash reserve but I won't be doing so at the expense of market exposure. I've payed for that too many times already both figuratively and literally."

Meanwhile the same old story of rich getting richer. If you happened to buy these things before they inflated, you are very well off, heck you are actually interested in assets inflating.

This actually shows a lot, anyone getting into stock market now are generally worried, everything seems overbought and they don't know what they should do about this exactly. Same worries also shows in housing market, do you buy your family house today at these extreme prices, or is it all going to come crashing down in near enough time period ?

2021-04-18 23:12:06,stocks,"DCA wins. It's crazy that the simplest of strategies is actually the best strategy. A monkey could do it. Problem is humans are emotional as fuck and even when they think they are being rational, they are actually acting the opposite. Don't be ""fearful"" of the market. That's emotions talking and making decisions for you.

Throw all that nonsense out the window and just dollar cost average to 10'ish years before retirement and then start looking at making major moves in profit-taking and changes in portfolio risk profiles.

I'm in my mid 30s, been actively investing for 15 years with a manageable monthly contribution...and....I don't know shit about day trading or timing the market...but let's just say I have almost as much wealth as my parents....and I'm 30 years behind them. DCA will make you a millionaire if you stick to it, don't let emotions make decisions for you, and you make sure to KEEP CONTRIBUTING EVERY SINGLE MONTH. I've bought shares at insanely high prices and I've bought shares at the lowest of lows. Idc, because I buy every month, therefore I'm averaging just fine....with very little thought or in-depth analyses required.

DCA, for some reason (and idk why), is never the first piece of advice for new and early investors. Day trade and ""play""...sure, but wealth management isn't a seasonal activity. It is an endurance race that takes decade after decade of commitment and steadfast contributions. In DCA, the price doesn't matter. What matters is how many shares you've accumulated over 30-40 years. And then when retirement comes around the corner...then you start strategizing about profit-taking and rebalacing risk profiles to develop an exit strategy.

No 30 year old should have a total exit strategy imo. That is a decision driven purely by emotion and fear. Humans like to tinker away, and we break stuff when we play with it too much. Wealth management isn't something you tinker with. Time and consistent contributions is what matters. It's a game of patience more than it is a game of financial ""smarts."""

Would you be so kind to post all the companies you own so we can get some ideas?"
2021-04-18 22:34:11,stocks,"Only buying companies that give a dividend means you are only going to be buying a certain type of company that has matured and doesn't have any better use for the capital.

This is both a good and bad thing, not exclusively a good thing.

What investing in dividend stocks do is hedge your risks, but they also limit your potential reward because these companies generally aren't investing a lot into growth.

I would see them as excellent choices though for someone who no longer has an income."
2021-04-19 03:16:18,stocks,"> Dividends are misleading because share buybacks do the same thing while being more tax-efficient. Many companies that don't pay dividends, buyback shares.

Bingo. Share buybacks are just a more tax-efficient way of returning capital to investors. Really blows my mind when I hear people say ""I only want to realize gains in a non-tax efficient manner"" (aka- dividends). I'm not AGAINST dividends, but every time someone posts about how great dividends are without at least mentioning that they aren't even the most effective way to return capital to investors, I'm just forced to assume they're ignorant. And so yeah, kinda calling out OP here"
2021-04-18 22:30:49,stocks,"good link, thank you."
2021-04-18 22:34:25,stocks,"Depends on country. In the UK for example there is something equivalent to a roth, a dividend allowance, a capital gains allowance, and a flexible income allowance that can used against dividends. And on top of that, the capital gains rate varies according to income with a threshholding effect. 

In Ireland, tax on capital gains and dividends is also very different.

In practice company earnings transforming into a mix of dividends and capital gains is fairly good for a UK investor. Check out the yield on the FTSE100"
2021-04-18 20:21:50,stocks,Doesn't this miss the OPs point about dividends being disciplining?  If the management knows they won't be punished for not buying back as many shares then they don't have the same incentive as if they know they need to keep the dividend up.
2021-04-18 22:27:49,stocks,Buyback efficiency is unrelated to whether a dividend is being paid. The critical issue is whether the buyback is taking place at prices less than the inherent value of the company (i.e. sum of discounted future cashflows). Also; whether the cash could be put to better uses than a buyback that would increase IV faster *or* more importantly stop the company fucking failing randomly in a pandemic economic crash.

2021-04-19 13:11:29,stocks,"Has it ever occurred to any of you that corporations who exercise free speech/free choice are helping you to teach your government to control their spending?  Everyone wants to blame corporations for not paying enough taxes, but average public traded companies produce only 6-8% annual profit margins.  Due to double taxation(on dividends), tax rates on those profits can exceed 65%.     

Meanwhile, the government takes 40% of your gross annual production, sometimes more.  

Furthermore, increasing taxes on corporations only results in higher prices and lower wages, so you actually solve nothing."

Google can now pay all the taxes it owes without paying the US a penny. The US is an exception in terms of collecting global tax. The only reason they HQ in the US is for higher multiples in valuations and tax loopholes. 

Unless a global tax is introduced, closing loopholes will cause companies to move. A similar thing happened in U.K. law which previously allowed ‚Äòcontractors‚Äô to work like an employee but pay tax like a corporation, once that ‚Äòloophole‚Äô was closed a lot of individuals under this arrangement got similar roles in Ireland/France/Germany - reducing the total tax revenue, not increasing it."

However, I argue that arms, particularly firearms in the hands of the weak can do great good.

Before the invention of the firearm a strong man would almost always prevail against the weak. But with a firearm the weak could defend themselves. A great good in my estimation.

One of the first historic pistols was called the Colt Peacemaker for that reason. It was said that God created man but Samuel Colt evened the odds. (In a fight) You and I would probably agree that since God created Samuel Colt then God evened the odds.

looking at their history of growth I just cannot believe that"
2021-04-19 04:09:12,stocks,"Let's just examine that statement for a little bit so we're both on the same page:

1. MS is NOW worth 2T$ - priced in is its current standing as well as future short-term discounted gains for current tech pipeline.

2. Growth means two things:

a: MS maintains its current relevance/cashflow/tech adoption 

AND 

b: MS comes up with new products which make a splash big enough to cause a blip on 2T$.

Let's say even 5% growth - that means a new product which generates 100B revenue. I know they kept buying stuff like Skype and wanted Discord and now bought AI speech software which was used for Siri and that's great, especially skype being converted into MS Teams was a great push. Azure is really kicking ass in the server space but it's already priced in since it's adoption is widespread.

ATM I don't see any source of future growth in their line-up or any announced project/acquisition.

As far as HISTORY is concerned: they've grown a lot during Bill Gates and Nadella's tenure but everything else was quite stagnant and they've had multiple botched products and/or strategies: windows vista, 8, nokia acquisition, windows ARM and phone as well as SQL not really keeping up with mySQL or most server-oriented tech with Linux. They've had growth, they had stagnation, they also had lots of headwind. MS didn't just ""keep growing"" for anyone to believe they will continue to do so.

------------------

In conclusion: will they stay relevant, successful and have 2T$ worth of a company in the near future? Very likely.

Will they grow to 3T or make significant headway in that direction? Atm I have no reason to think that.

I'm open to anything which would suggest otherwise."

This year they released new techniques for [carbon capture](https://news.cision.com/aker-carbon-capture-as/r/aker-carbon-capture-and-siemens-energy-join-forces-on-sustainable-power-generation,c3311971) and the reuse of [waste heat](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210212005363/en/Siemens-Energy-Signs-Agreement-to-Build-First-of-its-Kind-Waste-Heat-to-Power-Facility-in-Canada) for power generation. Aswell showing the modern approach for [Cloudbased energy production](https://press.siemens-energy.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-energy-shapes-internet-energy-digital-products) what looks nice due to more and more distributed power generation and grids.

H2 will be dominating in the future, but energy companies don't know if it evolves into smaller distributed production or big centralized.

One general concern is if there's an oversupply of SPACs and a smaller supply of good private companies ready to go public via a merger then the SPACs can end up bidding against themselves in terms of the valuation that they give to the company, so then when the merger takes place the people who already owned shares then own a smaller piece of the newly merged company. But if the company you're looking at already established a valuation that you're comfortable with it wouldn't really matter (is it possible the stock price change you mentioned was due to valuation news though?). 

The other thing is to look at how many warrants are outstanding and when the people who had a stake in the original private company can start cashing out shares- so you can keep an eye on dilution."

Then you have the recent shit shows of ex spacs such as GOEV and RMO, who basically 180'd from their investor presentations and revenue forecasts - this isn't helping pre revenue or early revenue firms coming through SPACs.

GIK has a bit of stigma attached to it now (too many bagholders) and now the nav floor is out, it could easily drop further. If you're thinking of adding more, I'd be inclined to wait until merger is done and it bottoms out / shows a clear uptrend.

2021-04-18 21:08:52,stocks,"I've been holding strong and follow those subs everyday. Love all the DD, mostly makes sense to me but I can't foresee these 100mil, 10mil, 1mill numbers."
2021-04-18 21:58:25,stocks,So what‚Äôs realistic to you? Just your opinion
2021-04-18 22:12:13,stocks,"I definiltly feel like we zoom past 500 like we were supposed to last time, and we bounce around between 600-800, maybe we touch 1k for a bit but not sure itll last long.


I admit I don't know shit and anything than can happen (see DOGE), just gut feel. Just feels like if we hit 100mil/ 10 mil there's gonna be a lot of redditors out there richer than Elon and that just seems weird to me."
2021-04-18 22:31:38,stocks,I‚Äôd be happy to just make 800k with my shares lol
2021-04-19 05:26:03,stocks,"> Just feels like if we hit 100mil/ 10 mil there's gonna be a lot of redditors out there richer than Elon and that just seems weird to me.

There's not enough cash in the system for this to happen. It makes absolutely no sense for the price to go anywhere near these prices, and even if it was on that trajectory it would be shut down immediately because it WOULD crash the entire US economy. Anyone spouting that shit is delusional.

GME is an echo chamber which has had some amount of confirmation bias from the 2 squeezes we have seen. It may pop again, it may not, but if it does I would expect it to be slightly lower peak each time as it settles down to a fair value. 

I don't own any but if it popped again, I would be selling as soon as it hit $300. If it starts to drop before $300 I would sell then too. No shame in taking good profits."
2021-04-19 01:31:17,stocks,What's ur price target expectation.
2021-04-19 03:25:11,stocks,Was hoping at least 5k but I‚Äôd even be happy with 1k at this point lol
2021-04-18 23:53:08,stocks,NEE 5/21 80C has been printing. I bet they're gonna add it to the index tomorrow
2021-04-19 02:26:01,stocks,4.5% is the max I think. I would like to see plug down to 2-3% until it's financials are sorted.
2021-04-19 03:17:35,stocks,"I was mostly joking given the topic of this thread, but thanks baby doll ;)"
2021-04-19 11:38:09,stocks,The same thing happened to enphase energy when a short seller released a report on them. I sold in a panic. Missed out on a big bag with the quadrupling is shares. I‚Äôm in QS until retirement.
2021-04-19 10:02:24,stocks,"I mean no offense dude, but if you‚Äôre paying less than twice the minimum wage, you‚Äôre paying your employees shit. 

If you were paying exactly twice the minimum wage, to folks working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year with zero days off, that‚Äôs $30,160. But as you say, you‚Äôre not paying them that much. And I bet they‚Äôre not working 40 hours, 52 weeks a year. Plus, taxes takes 12%. Just so you know, the poverty wage for a family of 4 is $26,500. 

So yeah, you‚Äôre now competing with government assistance to attract workers. That doesn‚Äôt indicate there is something wrong with government assistance, it indicates there‚Äôs something wrong with how much you pay.

And how did you keep your workers safe during the pandemic? How many got covid? Many employers didn‚Äôt do much."
2021-04-19 11:35:16,stocks,"You know minimum wage is different in every state, right ? I pay well over double federal minimum. 

You go ahead and show me all these retail jobs with no higher education requirements that are paying over $16/hr to start. Go ahead"
2021-04-19 10:08:21,stocks,"Assuming your workers work 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year with no days off, you‚Äôre barely paying them above poverty level wages for a family of 4. Here‚Äôs hoping all your cashiers are single and working unrealistic hours."
2021-04-19 11:42:39,stocks,"I‚Äôm not the one with such a problem attracting workers that I complain when the federal government offers a poverty level wage to those out of work. 

Maybe, just maybe consider other reasons why people wouldn‚Äôt want to work for your charming self other than ‚Äúthey‚Äôre lazy.‚Äù"
2021-04-19 11:49:02,stocks,"It‚Äôs all employers, not a problem unique to me. But go ahead and keep blaming the evil business owners providing the jobs."
2021-04-19 12:01:48,stocks,"Consider the possibility that if you‚Äôre having problems finding people to work for you, you may have to:

A) offer more money
B) offer better benefits
C) offer greater protection/flexibility in a time where a lot of cashiers literally died or at the very least, got spat on and screamed at during a pandemic

Accept that maybe, your struggles to fill a very unattractive job‚Äîespecially in this environment‚Äî says very little about those who are out of work other than they‚Äôre not rushing to take a very unattractive job."
2021-04-19 12:48:06,stocks,"are you willing to pay double for your groceries ? That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking at if you want retail workers to be paid $30/hr. 

Also, don‚Äôt give me a high and mighty story about how hard these times have been - I was on the front line working alongside my staff every single day through the entire pandemic. I get it. I saw everyone else reclining at home and talking about how bored they were. 

Once again, it‚Äôs not just me and it‚Äôs not just retail - almost every employer is struggling to find help these days. 
Go out and talk to some business owners. You seem to have a very sheltered view of the world around you."
2021-04-19 16:09:16,stocks,your trash is my treasure fam i literally bought uwmc for that divi and its a powerhouse in mortages and expi baby on the dip
2021-04-18 21:49:08,stocks,"In comparison to literally

They are gone for all practical purposes, as (at least with current technology) they cannot be recovered"
2021-04-19 19:42:03,stocks,What? This is silly you are just ignoring the business lines laid out in the S-1 filing? They make a fortune from custodial holdings of others assets banks don‚Äôt and won‚Äôt have this capability for federal reasons. Coinbase represents 11% of the world‚Äôs exchange market. America is just waking up to crypto and the Coinbase is accessible to the worlds biggest market holding a minority stake compared to Europe. Margins are 60% and up which the S-1 already has fee reduction baked into scale.
2021-04-19 17:38:41,stocks,"Volume was pretty wild today, no idea what's going on. Being shorted?"
2021-04-19 10:44:43,stocks,"4/21

2021-04-19 15:27:23,stocks,Lol
2021-04-19 15:42:14,stocks,"I've been reminded by the bot.
Guess you're too bearish"
2021-04-18 21:44:45,stocks,"Tbh, probably would have bought a bunch of XOM and just collected the dividend on it until I found a promising prospective investment."
