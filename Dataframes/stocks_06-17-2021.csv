- don’t mind owning it

That’s perfect condition for selling Puts option. Time to learn it.

2021-06-17 19:43:46,stocks,"Reconsider and ask yourself is it worth more than the current price. Buy in if the answer is a yes, then if it dips buy some more more to average down."
2021-06-17 19:59:07,stocks,"That's a great question, and one we all have had to deal with, so you're not alone. The answer is that it depends. I know, crappy answer. 

Here's the deal. It depends on how bullish you are on the stock and even more importantly, how long you intend on investing in that stock.

Option 1 - not a long-term investment and you're very bullish on the stock. Buy right now. You are bullish in the short term because you feel the stock is undervalued and has a short-term price target high enough to justify the move. Using your example, the stock is at $140 today and when you wanted to get in when it was at $100, you felt it had a price target of $170 over the full year. You are now four months into it, so buy as you are expecting the stock to continue to rise and sell when you've hit your personal target. Always with a trailing stop of course. 

Option 2 - long-term investment and you're bullish. Buy now and don't look at its performance for another year. Meaning, you're going to keep this stock for decades, so it's short-term movement is irrelevant. 

Option 3 - not a long-term investment and you're only somewhat bullish. The stock has likely gone up as much as you would expect and you would have exited the position by now if you had invested at $100.

So, the real determinant is how long are you planning on holding and what is the price target you've set. Even if you think a stock has more room to go, but you have reach you price target and you were only in it for the short-term, stay away and don't sweat it. 

If you want the stock as part of your portfolio for many years to come, then short-term movement, even if it is not to your advantage, doesn't matter. If a stock is a long-term investment and it moved from $100 to $140, it doesn't matter a whole lot. Holding for decades on a good stock will go up in the long term.

Bottom line, you like the stock and it's under your price target or if it is a long-term investment, buy now and don't sweat it. If you don’t, sure it could move down, but it has a more than likely chance of going up. I say more than likely because if you're high on the stock, others probably are too and it's going to go up. If you try to time the market, or a single stock in this case, then you're going to be kicking yourself once that stock goes to $160, because baring any crazy event, it will go up.

Hope this helps and best of luck."
2021-06-17 19:44:58,stocks,"Setting strict exit points would solve this. If the company rises above your exit price, move on to the next one. If it's still under, reassess the risk/reward with the expectation of smaller profit and make decision.

If you're not trying to trade and you're trying to open a long position it's a bit less straightforward, but maybe a stock so volatile that you don't feel comfortable opening a position after just one day of movement isn't the best long target. Or it's such a good long target that the volatility is irrelevant. Another comment mentions selling puts, it's a good option for this case too."

2021-06-17 19:57:00,stocks,"Any insight on knowing you are paying more than you would have had you entered when you first started monitoring it?

Like, I ask myself: would I buy an iPhone for $1400 today but it was $1200 at the store yesterday. I still love the phone. I still want the phone. But, aren't I a fool for doing it? I guess that's it. I feel foolish paying more for it."
2021-06-17 19:53:18,stocks,"Thanks for the reply. I like this. You could basically put it as a ratio formula. The closer it gets to your target, the greater the risk:reward ratio.

How would you handle the mentality of knowing you left great money on the table by buying in later? Example: NVDA at $550 a month ago and now approaching $750.

Note: I'm trying to do 24m LEAPS for leverage and then roll before expiry if my sentiment in the stock hasn't changed. Basically, long term investing in leverage."

2021-06-17 19:16:25,stocks,"Because it's not legal.

&#x200B;

In order for something to be considered insider trading, it has to pass two tests: is the information PUBLIC and is the information MATERIAL?

&#x200B;

PUBLIC means that anyone has access to the information. That doesn't mean it has to be published anywhere, for example you might notice that your favorite store is empty all the time. After calling around to your friends in different cities, they confirm. That would be considered public information, since anyone could do what you did. But if a newspaper has info that the rest of the world doesn't have, then it is not public - until they publish it.

&#x200B;

MATERIAL means: will the information affect the price of the stock once it is released? If the CFO has a sister who is about to come out of the closet, that is not material information. But if the COO is in the hospital with COVID, that is definitely material, and it would be illegal for doctors, nurses, etc in the know to trade or pass on that information.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, if someone is in possession of material, non-public information and they pass it on to someone else who then trades on it, *both* parties are guilty. So the newspaper workers cannot tell their best friends about stuff either."

2021-06-17 19:59:16,stocks,Short answer is...the Newspapers are owned by the same big money funds who send those articles in to them for publishing. Therefore it makes no sense for newpapers to short that stock as they are already doing so through their hedge funds.
2021-06-17 18:51:24,stocks,">it would also expose them to suspicion of conflict of interest \*whenever\* they published any story about any publicly traded company

That's certainly a good point, but I don't believe that many people would distrust the Wall Street Journal even if they put a small disclaimer that they had bought/sold the stock prior to the publishing of this article. Furthermore, if the more highly-respected news outlets continued to hold themselves to their prior standards and their reports continued to be verified I don't see why people wouldn't believe them."
2021-06-17 18:40:30,stocks,"Duh, but why don't actual newspapers do what they do when they discover real negative news?"
2021-06-17 19:40:30,stocks,"That makes perfect sense, thank you. However, if this is the case, how can Hindenburg do what they do? Don’t they act on information that is both non-public and material? Or does all the research they do count as something that could be done by anyone, and thus public information?"
2021-06-17 18:52:18,stocks,Did you read the post?
2021-06-17 19:01:21,stocks,"What it draws into question is the veracity of their fact checking. That small disclaimer could open the reporter up to legal charges of slander as well. It could further be used as a defense in lawsuits by companies that writer exposed unflattering information about as well. Hell, a reporter who's been shown to trade on confidential information could find themselves without access to any important information because their sources could get fired or sued by being outed in discovery- they'd loose the legal protections afforded to sources for journalists.

There have been news outlets that didn't allow their reporters to *vote.* Journalistic ethics is pretty much it's own *branch* of professional ethics, right up there with medical and legal ethics, because journalists are afforded a lot of special protections. They exercise constitutional rights ordinary citizens rarely get to. Their contribution to society is uniquely valuable and it comes with responsibilities we don't ask of other citizens."

I decided to invest in VIO, Square, Fiverr and many more and though I have confidence they will end up making me money in the future, VOO/VTI would have been a better option. I would suggest always maxing your Roth IRA first if you are playing the long game over playing with individual stocks."

If you are interested in investing, when you get to a point you can take on more risk, try choosing individual stocks if it interests you as a percentage of your portfolio. I wish I would have gotten interested 10 years ago, but it is pretty addicting researching and finding stocks to invest in and can be very rewarding. I wouldn't recommend yoloing it into a meme stock, but if you're young and are able to do so, nothing wrong with risks. Most investors don't become wealthy by throwing money into index fund, they look for the next Apple, Factbook,  etc."

Only advice is try to do so in tax free accounts as much as possible"
2021-06-17 19:15:09,stocks,"Yes. Good that you are starting that young. I wish I did. 

Look for seting up a Roth ira and maximize its tax benefits. Like once you get older and you want to use your money in roth to buy a house, pay for school, medical expenses etc it will not be taxed. Or when you are ready to retire all the growth your contributions has accumulated will not be taxed when you take money out.

2021-06-17 16:45:22,stocks,"Here we have a question of theory versus reality, and I have an answer for both.

&#x200B;

THEORY: Stocks trade based upon the expectation of future earnings. The key word is ""future"". When you see a stock come out with great earnings and drop (and wonder why) it's because the new price is based on the next earnings, a quarter from now. Or perhaps a year from now. Or maybe two years from now. The past is the past, and stocks trade based upon the future. P/E ratios are important, although be warned... they can easily be manipulated.

&#x200B;

If the above worked as it should, stocks wouldn't change prices more than once or twice a month, because everyone would know the fair value and that's where the price would be, all the time.

&#x200B;

REALITY: Stocks, like everything else, trade based on supply and demand. The individual doesn't know where the supply or demand comes from, we can only take educated guesses. When a stock is hyped, the demand goes up because people are buying it, and therefore the price increases. If a stock is boring and not followed by many, then they could be a fantastic investment but undervalued due to the lack of demand.

&#x200B;

In a perfect world prices would be linked directly to earnings, which would drive supply and demand. But we aren't in a perfect world.

&#x200B;

A good, solid company that is growing AND is followed by a lot of players on wall street will have some correlation between theory and reality, but it won't be a direct match. 

&#x200B;

COMBINING THE TWO: If you think about it for a minute, you will realize that the things that (almost always) cause big moves in any given stock is an announcement or event that was previously unknown. When the announcement takes place, suddenly the price adjusts, and goes in a new direction as the news is disseminated. Unfortunately, unless you have access to insider information, it is a challenge to know what is unknown. Which is why we take educated guesses and bet on our beliefs. The more accurate you are, the more money you will make when news eventually breaks."

Not entirely true. Since you might need to suddenly sell your shares for whatever reason, like Fat Tony wants his debt repayed tomorrow. Now, you think, I know the price, you know the price, you can sell for the price. But no, the buyer knows the price, and he knows you're exactly at it, so he wants you to sweeten the deal. Give him a discount. Or you could find someone who wants in real bad, so he's willing to pay more than it's worth just to get in. It becomes a mind game of how much everyone is willing to stray from the fair price. Not like it isn't all mind games anyway already."

Still sucks to see it down so much in a day though. I think oil is on an unstoppable upward trend. People are just now starting to travel again in earnest."
2021-06-17 15:38:52,stocks,"This was probably because of the 4% dip in oil wti for a few hours, looking at it now, looks like it’s down 1%, but it doesn’t look like any of the oil positions I’m tracking have accounted for the dip in oil being bought up (maybe someone expects further dips?) I just ended up buying more and opened leaps on XLE/closed my CCs."
2021-06-17 15:52:19,stocks,"I first started buying in the mid 40s, Devon and Suncor I got at 20, and 17 respectively. I do not really want to average up on those names though. I initially sold almost all of my exxon at it's first peak around $60 in March, and bought back in around $52. I have since averaged up a bit. My cb on exxon is not great by any means, but that's why I figured long calls would be a good way to get leveraged gains.

I think it's at the point where people are taking profits who go in at the range you have, it makes sense. It's the sell the news aspect, and its also June and tomorrow is the quad witch. Volatility is expected, I just didn't think oil would take a hit this quick. I think we will recover. As I said, wti and Brent are trickling up mid day."
2021-06-17 15:42:33,stocks,"Oil is a volatile commodity and I think it has been in a very stable uptrend with very few plus +/- 1% moves. It seems that it's finally at a point of dispute where the prices SHOULD be, not where they are. Oil is heading higher, that's just a fact as of right now. I was very surprised a correction came this quickly in all honesty. 

I took the opportunity to buy some more exxon and long calls. Seems to be a smart move in my eyes. Limited supply and high demand. Earnings in July will be reassuring and then I bet the price of wti will also steadily rise through until December as people continue to travel via air and cruise lines. 

I couldn't agree more with you."
2021-06-17 16:38:06,stocks,"This drop for Suncor didn't make much sense unless someone was selling their position?  Before when Oil futures tanked due to Iran Nuclear talks, Suncor dipped hard, this was a more prolonged controlled sell off."
2021-06-17 16:49:28,stocks,"Stronger dollar I think, it hit all commodities. That's my main thought, dollar spiked a bit today. It wasn't just oil, which was a reason I bought calls on the dip. I could be wrong, but I don't think oil is going down in price because some futures got beaten down a bit. It's just the beginning of summer. I believe we will see $80 Brent/$75 WTI this year."
2021-06-17 17:20:33,stocks,I think you are right on brent reaching $80.  Personally I think it might go above that due to artificial supply/demand suppression.
2021-06-17 14:41:51,stocks,"eli5: you buy call, stock go up, you make money

simpler version: options are complicated. don't buy one until you read multiple articles/watch youtube videos. options are actually very easy to understand, you just need to put in the time and effort."
2021-06-17 17:54:49,stocks,"Look at it online by a video, they explain it really well. I will give it a go, but they are way better at explaining than I am.

When I started trading, and I started with options right away (which I would never recommend anyone), I had specific things I couldn't understand and the videos I watched all just made weird comparisons to houses and stuff - which are right, but if you are looking for specific things they throw you off.

Q: What options exist?

A: Call and Put. Call for price going up, Put for price going down.

Q: Why do options generate so much more profit than simply buying shares? 

A: Each option contains a value equivalent to 100 shares, meaning profits will be multiplied by 100. At the end you can decide to either sell your contract or exercise it.

Q: What are ""profits"" on options? What is exercising?

A: Green money. Jokes aside, when you buy an option, you choose a strike price and an expiry date. Remember it's worth 100 shares? The strike price is what these 100 shares are worth upon buying the contract. Exercising an option means you buy the shares at the strike price you set in the beginning, no matter how much higher or lower the current price is. 

Q: Hold on, upon buying them? I just set how much the shares are worth? So I can just take a 100$ share, put it at 1$ and then exercise it to buy 100 shares worth 10000$ for 100$?!

A: No, this is where Intrensic and Extrensic Value comes to play, but you look that up online. A price of a contract ALWAYS includes such differences, so in this case the contract would cost you AT LEAST 99$ per share, so 9900$. 

Q: Holy shit, a contract costs 9900$?!

A: At least, yes, but only because you chose a strike price of 1$ for a 100$ share. If you choose a strike price that is out of the money (so above the current price of the share if it's a Call, or below the current price of the share if it's a put or at the exact same value for both, then you don't pay this extra.

Q: So...if I buy a contract with a strike price of 100$, then I pay nothing?

A: You still pay a premium. The premium is based on many things, but in short it's based on volatility of the stock (or in other words, how likely it is to move up and down), as well as how far dated out your contract is.

Q: Okay okay, so I call option for ABC worth 100$ per share at a strike price of 105$, isn't that then stupid? Because there seems to be no difference between 100$ or 105$, as I would only pay more money if I would buy it for let's say 95$, which adds 5$ times 100?

A: Come on, if it sounds like it makes no sense, then look it up or think about it. This will result in it costing less. In general, the less likely it is that your target is hit, the lower is the premium. That's why higher volatility means a higher premium, as your target will most likely be hit.

Q: But...what does volatility help? I have my expire date let's say 1 month in the future, if it jumps up in 2 weeks and then crashes down, then this is a higher risk than it just being less volatile but climbing up!

A: You can close your options at any time - so you choose the moment you do so. If it looks like a profit you aimed for, then just close it and don't look back (except for analysing, but if you are a person that gets emotional, starts hesitating, re-thinking 200 times when it comes to executing, then don't look back. Ever.)

Q: Okaaay, but...if I have a strike price at 95$ and the current price is at 90$, do I have to buy it then when it expires?!

A: No. You just let it expire. It didn't hit your goal, so it's just worth nothing.

Q: So...I ""only"" lose the so called premium?

A: Correct. You can never lose more than you put when you open the contract.

Q: So much how capital do I need to buy an option? Just enough for the premium? Or enough to technically exercise the option?

A: This depends on the Broker. Some require margin, actually all that I am on, so I don't know for others. Interactive Broker e.g. also requires you to have a minimum of 2000$, though that might have changed meanwhile. 

Q: Okay so buying options, I got that. A contract is worth 100 shares, that's why the profit is so much higher. But I have to at least make the premium as profit or the entire contract ends on a negative. A Call option is for the price going up, a Put options is for the price going down, which is important for the Strike Price that I choose - otherwise I pay the difference as Premium and make it even worse if the strike price is not hit since the Premium is way higher. 

A: Yea, as a rough summary. Also, it's smart to close your options a decent time before the option expires. It's never worth to gamble towards the end unless of course your option is worthless right now (e.g. strike price of 105$ and the current price is 103$), then just let it go until you can close it. IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't know if this is different per broker and I have never let an option expire, but I read that some people that had their POSITIVE options expire received nothing, because they expired. Upon expiry, it didn't matter for them if they were up 500% or 0%, it's just worthless the very moment it was hit. So make sure this doesn't happen to you.

Everyone has their own definition of ""worthwhile"".

Some investors won't lift a finger for under $1000 of profit. Some are happy to make $5 on a trade. 

It really does come down to your personal budget, your goals, and your risk tolerance. (Never forget it's just as easy to lose as it is to gain.)"
2021-06-17 15:15:54,stocks,"Since no one is giving you exact examples but rather just broad generalizations. Here is a good idea. You want to invest 100? Well you clearly can’t afford an Amazon stock lol. And don’t do “fractions of shares” shit. Eff that. So now you know you’re limited to stock prices less than or equal to 100. 

Then just go based on companies that are solid or have good growth potential (if you have the timeframe). For example. GE V. O  is a solid stock. 8 bucks a share now. Will easily grow to 20 bucks by end of year. Almost a 300% return. I highly doubt that X this year will go from 24 to 100. You won’t see that most likely. You can tell by looking at historical trends and what the future holds (short term infrastructure could be a boon for X but after that it’s likely going to green energy stocks like CHPT and G E V. O for example). That’s how you can narrow it. 

These people will just tell you to do all this insane research to make 2% gains. Eff that. Go on broad technicals and what you think (and others) the future holds for particular sectors. Obviously risk will be involved (for example solarwinds tanked after a hack and it still hasn’t recovered). You can’t predict those so just be wary of course. Shit happens"

2021-06-17 15:39:13,stocks,No problem. This sub is good to keep an eye on but they aren’t super useful to beginners. Maybe some really technical stuff. Plus these people aren’t making like 10% gains. They get raging boners from 1% gains. They are like long term 40 year share holders. They wouldn’t go near AMC or GME with any amount of money. That’s not always the best decision (I mean I would never go into those two but sometimes certain meme stocks can land you big gains as long as you get out in time). This also depends if you want to hold for the long haul (like months or years?) or like daily or weekly holds (or a mixture of the two). That’s important for strategizing. Depends on how much time you have on a daily basis to invest in this. Lol. Good luck and I hope you get some big gains! 💪🏻
2021-06-17 15:40:47,stocks,You're welcome :)
2021-06-17 16:38:22,stocks,"Idk why this answer hasn't come up yet but think of it in market cap. For e.g If Company A is worth 1 trillion $ and has shares at 1000$ each and Company B is worth 1 trillion $ and has shares at 10$ each.
And for e.g we know each company is going to grow 50% in the next year to 1.5 trillion $ market cap.

If you have 1000$ to invest. Either you buy 1 share at 1000$ or 100 shares at 10$. 
Now in a year these will grow at 50% meaning 1000$×1.5=1500$ or 10$×1.5×100 shares= 1500$.
Either way you gain the same amount of money no matter what the stock price is.

Although some investors like a 100 shares so they can sell covered calls. Because option contracts are sold in 100 of shares."
2021-06-17 16:08:55,stocks,"This has nothing to do with itrade specifically, and everything to do with not understanding USD/CAD accounts."
2021-06-17 16:17:38,stocks,"It sounds like you are just trying to inform others so they avoid similar situations, but you frame it in way that Scotia did something wrong/scummy which is not the case. It's simply you not understanding how the accounts work."
2021-06-17 14:30:51,stocks,LOL this is why you have USD and CAD ‘sides’ of your account. I also have a USD chequing account i opened (it’s free) which I used to transfer my USD stock option grants from work to my iTrade account so I didn’t get burned on the FX.
2021-06-17 14:22:02,stocks,"Does iTrade not let you hold funds in both USD and CAD? Questrade does. I have most of my money in USD to buy US equities etc as the canadian market is pretty lame and lacklustre. If you can, I would convert to USD funds and just have it ready so you can take advantage of quick opportunities vs having to wait for conversion etc etc."
2021-06-17 15:46:58,stocks,Look up Norbert’s gambit to save on the bank FX spread penalty if you want to convert CAD funds for your USD account.
2021-06-17 15:52:08,stocks,"Lol that’s why you always exchange before you execute a trade!

But hopefully this teachers others that don’t know"

2021-06-17 14:32:23,stocks,"Yes it will let you hold both currencies but you can do that in the CAD or USD portion of the account. If you're using the CAD side, you have to convert back to CAD when selling US securities and get ripped off by the FX spread. I was having to sell and convert back to CAD, then rebuying US securities with CAD"
2021-06-17 14:32:45,stocks,"Yes they do but you need to pick the right account when you’re initiating a trade. You can buy USD securities from the CAD account and they do an “on the fly” FX transaction to purchase, then when you sell it’s another “on the fly” FX conversion back to CAD. This is what OP is complaining about."
2021-06-17 17:03:06,stocks,The one thing that is slightly confusing or specific to iTrade is that they never used to have USD available in registered accounts and you instead had to pay a monthly (maybe quarterly?) fee to get a discount on forex

Amazon sold books online at the start and never turned a profit for many years before it became what it is today. Many people made fun of Bezos. Thats the thing no one knows the future.
2021-06-17 17:58:22,stocks,Nio. Sorry for confusion. I think EV is the future but it’s bubbled too soon. They all need a bigger correction and I might buy back in. I also don’t trust China at all. They will eat their own companies if they ever step out of line no matter how big. So if I do buy back in it will be a very small % of my portfolio.

2021-06-17 13:39:28,stocks,"Open a Fidelity account (Roth IRA if you don't have one already, taxable brokerage or cash management account if you already have an IRA) and put it on one of their zero fee mutual funds (FNILX or others) or into Vanguard (VOO). 

If you choose VOO, set it to automatically reinvest dividends.

The reason you want Fidelity is for the partial shares. Some stocks are very expensive, but Fidelity lets you buy a fraction of that share for a fraction of the cost. It allows you to invest with smaller amounts of money.

Then, don't sell those shares for as long as you can. Just sit back, check maybe once a year, and watch your account value increase.

Also, don't wait until the market pops. About 2/3rds of the time, immediate investing will outperform trying to time the market."

Any increase from the Fed will be too little too late, and any increase will be small in the big picture. Quite frankly, if you're looking for a bear case, I'd much rather use China's price regulations.

None of that factors in the obscene demand the industry will see. Particularly with the miners, and the growing green energy market. Semiconductors are just the tip of the iceberg. There's a push to electrify the world, including remote or impoverished areas like parts of Africa, that will demand huge resource needs. And of course, every carbon neutral energy source requires a ton of metal.

In the PM sector, inflation will absolutely pressure gold higher, but it's really Basel 3 that will have the most impact on value.

Any rate hike will have immediate downward pressure, just because the market is so sensitive to every change, but over the long term will be only a small part of the equation."

NXE, which owns the best uranium deposit in the world at a time where there is about to be a major push for clean energy that only uranium can fill. SAND, who gets paid a royalty from gold miners, and doesn't have to do any of the heavy lifting. TRMLF, a Canadian oil company and a significant player globally in the natural gas market.

Some ""safer"" mining names include RIO, VALE, and BHP. To a lesser extent, FCX, GLEN, and NUE. For PMs, GOLD, NEM, KGC. In oil, BP, CVX, EPD, ENB.

2021-06-17 13:58:10,stocks,"""Redemption of senior debt"" means they are paying off money they previously borrowed.  Senior debt has priority over subordinate debt, it is a class of borrowing.  Paying off your debts is a always a good thing."

2021-06-17 12:38:03,stocks,Investors purchased bonds and became creditors of the company. The bonds had a condition that they could be redeemed prior to maturity and are considered senior debt bc the company is obligated to repay these creditors before they repay subordinate debt holders. Company wants to buy this swath back to the tune of +700mil. There could be a variety of reasons they are redeeming the note. Depending on their age they probably want to buy them and reissue debt at a lower int rate or perhaps simply want to wipe the debt off the books.

I then evaluate those 100 using what’s important to me; such as understanding the company’s competitive advantage, Free Cash Flow Yield, PEG, Debt to Equity, etc to determine which stocks I would like to own.  

I like Morningstar because they determine the fair price based on factors I like; such as predictable free cash flow and level of risk.

Individual Analyst Ratings should not be used as they are biased.  During times when the S&P500 is clearly overvalued; Analyst Ratings still rate 90% of those stocks as a buy. These Analyst must do what they are told by their company and these companies have a vested interested to lean favorable, especially those they have connections with, which is most of them. I also believe these analyst are predicting what people will pay for the stock more so than what the stock is truly worth."

But if you’re following the hour to hour,  day to day week to week of the markets, there can be a ton of volatility and short term, whipsaw moves. And it doesn’t always go by what you think would drive such moves. A lot of what is going on in the market right now is a war between two forces—the Fed and Inflation. If the Fed is right, interest rates will stay low, inflation will get under control by itself as supply chains and production catches up to where they were before the pandemic, and we’ll all be fine. If the Fed is wrong, inflation will begin to be a drag on the economy and send all sorts of things haywire, and the Fed will need to raise rates sooner than they want to stem the tide. Higher rates will be a headwind for the stock market. So right now, the market is vacillitating between those two possibilities while continuing to deal with the pandemic and political fallout that is impacting certain industries. While also dealing with the relatively new impact of meme traders and the accompanying volatility.

Real money in investing is made over the course of years, or even decades. Judging your own performance based on short-term price movements over the span of mere months is a fool’s errand. Anything can happen to markets in the short-term; they can go up, down, sideways, or in fucking circles, but in the long-term, they can only really go up.

Continue to do your due diligence and invest in stocks and funds that you have researched and understand. Do not get discouraged by short-term underperformance, and do not chase outperformance by throwing your savings at failing companies like GameStop and AMC.

But at that time, it will NOT be the popular sentiment.

This is not a knock on you. This should be a learning a moment and a period of self realization. Not everyone is able to predict things accurately. Not everyone can spend time researching to find the correct trade. And last even if you do the above, everyone still makes mistakes. I would recommend you switch strategies. 

A wise person adapts to the situation. If you are not good at projecting future outcomes, dont do it until you get good at it. You get good by studying. Make a fake paper account and trade there while you figure things out. I did this recently to see how good I am at day trading. Been experimenting with it for about 2 months. 

In the meantime, stop trying to time things. For now, buy low fee ETF's. Yea its boring and wont beat the market but its safe and steady. If you want to be more aggressive then pick more concentrated funds.

2. Ignore the news. When CNBC is talking about stocks for inflationary environments, you can be sure that many other people have already bought ahead of time. These folks are now selling to those late to the party. At best, the news is an indicator of what the current consensus thinking is.

3. Avoid buying the hot sectors of the moment. Instead, invest in boring or unloved sectors. Mr. Market is moody and sentiment swings over time. This provides opportunities to buy cheap. At the moment, there is opportunity in the tobacco sector. It's both boring and unloved.

4. Even if you could predict the macroeconomic conditions for the next year, you still wouldn't be able to predict how other market participants will react. Instead of worrying about unpredictable short-term data, identify companies that will continue to do well over the next few decades, regardless of macroeconomic conditions. A couple of examples are Novo Nordisk, the world leader in diabetes medication, and Otis Elevator. These companies have significant tailwinds and strong competitive advantages."

Seems like the best option for you is to buy into some passive index funds that will grow your confidence in the market.

My tips are 

-slowly drip feed into the index funds you pick every month.

- If the funds you have invest hit a 5% decrease in value then then consider investing more than you usually do to take advantage of a reduced price and increased value of your selected funds.

My current index funds are these 

-Legal & General Global 100 Index 

-HSBC FTSE All World Index

-HSBC American Index

-HSBC FTSE 250 Index

If you Google those index funds it'll tell you what company's they hold. They hold a wide array of companies in many different markets around the world from many different sectors. I would recommend this strategy maybe even look into more index funds."

Just compare P/Es for large, mid, and small caps - you'll see that the large caps are very high historically. Look at the chart of these sectors like banks, travel, materials, etc. You're buying very high up at this point. And while the party can go on in the short term, at some point, prices will catch up with reality i.e. fundamentals.

That's why many people prefer very broad diversified total market or even total world funds. They don't move up as much but they tend to have a hard floor on them.

And gone lower why and how ? You do realize past 2 - 3 earnings have been absolute floor breakers, destroying, no completely nuking their earnings.

Also massively overvalued ? You people been saying that for past 13 years, how has that worked out ?

Buy low, sell high, seriously don't over think it too much, it the tech really goes lower, buy more or wait it out. Buying low and selling high doesn't mean perfectly time it, kinda timing it works too.

Seriously been having this argument past half a year, people coming and telling us that tech is going to crash hard, its over for tech etc. best it can do is stagnation.

You have to identify stocks that you believe in or have an investment thesis. In downturns on those companies, if nothing fundamental has changed with the core business and it's just market noise, then that's a strict discount, you should be buying more not clearing out. I think the market noise is guiding your moves versus finding companies you understand. Play a few good companies and you will come to understand what is on discount vs what isn't. If you are chasing market news you will continue to get pushed around. If you are holding etf's just consistently buy as it doesn't matter long term what's happening now. You either buy into a rising economy or you get discounts. 

As for the economic analysis, you'll come to refine your understanding. Everyone thinks inflation = bad, not necessarily. Runaway inflation is, and the feds indicated that they will control inflation so that it doesn't get out of hand. With rates still near zero, and future rate hikes pushed out to what looks like 2023, that is still 2 yrs of growth runway for growth/tech etc. Because reopening / inflation fear plays had a good runup, the street likes to find alpha elsewhere, and given the new fed direction, the alpha is in the beaten up tech sector which has seen some recovery. DOW and S&P stocks can only be so richly valued, tech can be richly valued too but there is a larger case for their valuations. In short, for the near term, the daq is back. In order to ride out these sector rotations and stuff however, you really need to find good solid companies you enjoy, so you dont lose sleep. Meaning if the price drops, that's a discount buy, if it rises, great. You should be winning either way with your picks regardless of the immediate dollar P/L reflected in your portfolio.

The worst thing you can do is follow everybody else's trades. One day it's tech stocks. Another day it's value stocks for reflation trades. Then it's meme stocks. Now back to tech stocks. Keep FOMOing and switching from stocks to stocks will destroy your portfolio faster than anything else.

Stick with one strategy that you believe in. Cut losses if you stop believing what you were investing in fundamentals no longer hold true.

Well yeah, that dives what we classify meme territory or others classify as reddit stocks, i wasn't generally including highly risky and volatile stocks into rotation talk.

Why suddenly betting ? Can't you just check it ? What ETF did you buy 13 years ago, how did it perform ? How did the tech perform ?

Also why are we talking about ETF right now ? I just pointed out his mistake while rotating was buying high, selling low, never even discussed to buy ETF or not to buy it.

You are honestly pretty incoherent.

>except for the giants like FAANG

And why do we suddenly have to start the ''except FAANG'' ? They would be part of the equation after all. I have not seen anyone who would buy a tech and somehow forget to buy FAANG. On top of that FAANG rise was absolutely massive, even though people were crying overvalued at everything, just sticking one of them into the portfolio and you can have tons of dead and ditch companies along. 

Even 5 years ago the discussions on what to hold for next 5 years had quite a lot of Facebook and Nvidia. 

Today the general use would be switching out Netflix with Nvidia, and don't forget to consider AMD.

>the majority of individual tech stocks are probably dead in a ditch now

That is a big claim though, would want to see more of it.

But even then i was just talking about buying low, selling high, the opposite of what poster did. Doomsdaying that every drop is going to send us in free fall and every rise is going to create a major market crash doesn't make much sense to buying low and selling high

Many bank loans are interest rate sensitive, meaning that when interest rates rise so do banks profits. This is bad for shorts.

Since these fees are priced at the whim of the bank, they can be raised at any moment in time, generating additional profits.

I wouldnt short to begin with.  Unless you mean buying puts.   Puts on bank stocks are probably not expensive and could work as a hedge i guess.

Joe Biden wants to eliminate stepped-up cost basis and instantly slam all heirs with inheritance taxes plus cap gains taxes.  He also wants to raise federal cap gains tax rates to 40%+.  If Biden gets his way, heirs could lose over 80% of their inheritance through combined federal cap gain tax, state cap gains tax, city cap gains tax (like in Philly and NYC), federal inheritance tax, and state inheritance tax.

But it is definitely a poor performer if you are building wealth. Dividend growth has been extremely sluggish for more than 5 years, rising only about 17.5% in that time frame. Share price has also barely moved $4 up in 5 years for a flaccid 1% gain per year. Add in the div, and you are basically looking at 5% gain per year (averaged). Not the end of the world, but obviously, way below a standard S&P index ETF. 

That said, if you zoom out 10 years then it looks great so it really is a matter of timing. Do not make the mistake of thinking that rising property prices help REITs however. Thats a mistake. Though equity gains are always good for many reasons such as allowing said REIT to leverage more, you cant just sell their properties to realize a gain. In general, REITs are valued based on operating sector and cap rates. So what you want is rents to go up. 

Though it might make sense for rent to go up when property value goes up, this isnt always the case. Rent is actually tied to household income growth for residential and business growth for everything else. If you go to other countries, for example, where land is scarcer but incomes are lower, you will find property values are sky high but cap rates are super low and thats just normal in most of the world.

Not advising to buy or sell. Just saying it how it is. You will need to decide. Id say for a retiree then O is a good choice for safe income. For everyone else, stick to VOO or BKLC."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Paysafe (PSFE) poised to beat analysts estimates TLDR : See summary at bottom

With PSFE’s daily short volume often in the 40-65% range, many believe the share price is being tactically pinned down as 13F filings have steadily revealed more institutions taking large positions. Joining noted fund managers David Tepper, Aaron Cohen, Dan Loeb and Leon Cooperman, Wells Fargo’s various funds have picked up 12 million shares and Blackstone has increased their holdings by an additional 37 million shares.

Some have calculated that share lockup rules have reduced the true available float to as little as 80-85 million shares, causing the most recently reported short interest of 36 millions shares to have an outsized effect.  But shorts must be covered eventually.  A common theory, given the regular 700K-2M block trades we’ve seen, is that aggressive shorting enables large funds to accumulate before Q2 ER (which should beat estimates) and before PSFE is added to the Russell 3000 Index next month. Goldman Sachs also anticipates Paysafe’s Russell 1000 inclusion which, in light of their projected $100+ billion in market share, would likely be followed by other benchmark funds and ETFs, carving out yet even more of the available float.

Along with now priced-in fears of PE lockup expiration (more on that below), it’s clear that PSFE’s share price has also suffered from the Q1 report of YoY 5% quarterly revenue growth which, no doubt, disappointed the short-term expectations of many impatient traders invited in by constant Cramer and Steve Grasso pumps.  It's understandable that, over the last few months, PSFE has reportedly experienced a large demographic shift away from younger shareholders, indicating a transition to a steadier long-term investor base.

But that 5% number may have been misleading to some who didn’t bother to look under the hood.  Paysafe not only upgraded the low end of their 2021 revenue guidance to $1.53 billion, they beat analysts’ average estimate and they also noted that revenue growth would have been “mid to high teens” were it not for their strategic “market/channel exit to improve overall risk/reward profile.”  This was not a surprise as they explained: “adjusting for the actions we have discussed in our Analyst Day and continued risk reward optimization in our business model, our revenue growth would have been in the mid to high teens.” Based on valuation comps, such a growth rate would easily support a share price double the current level.

Paysafe’s quarterly revenue, gross profit and EBITDA numbers all came in at the upper range of their guidance along with a 63% gain in eCash revenue and 29% gain in free cash flow to over $108 million for Q1 alone.  On the day of their earnings report, initial headlines were favorable: “Paysafe beats on revenue, Reaffirms 2021 outlook” only to be suddenly overtaken by articles almost uniformly focused on the negative, offering oddly biased summaries like: “Sees Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $110M-$120M, which means it could fall below the Q1 level of $113.2M.”  (Obviously, given that range, it could just as well, if not more likely, rise above that number.)

Several outlets focused on an EPS miss of $0.02 despite the fact that Paysafe did not offer any EPS estimate to miss.  Even now, many platforms continue to wildly misreport their financial data.  For example, Yahoo Finance falsely reports a much more dramatic $0.37 miss, something that would naturally deter potential investors at first glance.

Intentional or not, analysts’ EPS estimates overlooked previously signaled temporary quarterly expenses associated with paying down $1.16 billion in debt and the transaction that took Paysafe public.  The company noted: “Results included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.""

Take away these one-time non-recurring expenses which amount to roughly $90 million and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly earnings thereby significantly beating all analyst estimates.

Thanks to an improved credit rating, the company announced a refinancing of roughly a billion in debt at a 1.25%+ lower interest rate.  In all, their recent debt management measures will save them an estimated $92 million in annual operating costs.  Global Capital reports that their loan offers an additional 25bp margin step-down if the firm hits 3.7 times net leverage, something they told analysts they intend to activate quickly.

Taken together, all of this will greatly enhance EBITDA and free cash flow (already $362 million in 2020) enabling them to better pursue their “active M&A pipeline.”

Unless the company chooses, for strategic tax purposes, to write off some discretionary impairment expense on intangibles, they should soundly beat the current analysts’ average EPS estimate of $0.00 for Q2 and $0.02 for 2021.  Those analysts have a median price target $17.67, so consistently beating their estimates over the next three quarters will likely lead to price target upgrades (and new price catalysts along the way).

&#x200B;

Note on Private Equity lockup expiration:

Blackstone bought an additional 37 million shares of Paysafe beyond their original 123 million shares.  Redditor kiedennis noted that these additional shares would theoretically secure a 50.159% controlling interest for insiders, which some think could be part of ensuring Paysafe’s M&A strategy going forward.  At the very least, it protects the company from hostile takeover.  Notably, such a large purchase on top of the initial merger deal should allay fears that they’d want to sell when lockup expires in the coming weeks.  At this point it’s evident that such fears are priced in but some are still concerned so here are some further notes on the subject:

Back in 2017, Reuters reported Blackstone/CVC initially pursued Paysafe making five separate bids to take it private, increasing their bid 32% before Paysafe finally agreed. The Wall Street Journal later confirmed, Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private for $3.9 Billion. (Around $4.2 Billion in today’s dollars)

An inside source close to those negotiations said, “There is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents’ age,” adding that the private equity firms “have a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.”

Blackstone’s website says its typical investment term is “upwards of 7-10 years” which dovetails with the “decade-long thesis” noted above.

From 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020’s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth.

Recently Paysafe has gone public through reverse merger, paid down $1.2 billion in debt and Blackstone/CVC received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.  Adjusted for inflation, that’s only a 33% gain on a 4 year hold which tells me they’d want to stay on and benefit from Foley’s M&A playbook which has steadily proven to generate 300-800% growth in as little as 5 years (This falls nicely within Blackstone’s remaining time horizon). As part of the deal, Paysafe’s 20F filing confirms that Blackstone rolled $1.23 billion into Paysafe, keeping 123 million shares. Foley says, this is part of what “created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.”

More recently, Blackstone’s 13F shows they now own 160 million shares indicating that they acquired an additional 37 million shares outside of the deal structure. That’s $436 million more at the current share price. As insiders on the Board of Directors, they wouldn’t take on that level of additional exposure if they didn’t see serious value here. Dan Loeb (Third Point)’s 13F indicates they also picked up more shares beyond their original PIPE investment. For the above reasons, along with the depressed share price, I highly doubt private equity would be seeking a near-term exit.

&#x200B;

TLDR summary:

Paysafe has put itself in a great position to beat analyst EPS estimates for Q2, Q3, Q4 and 2021 overall, leading to raised price targets and  positive price action catalysts.

Q1's one-time $90 million in expenses showed Paysafe is already poised for significant profit growth.  Recent  debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures even higher  profits going forward.

The picture gets  brighter with the introduction of fast growing revenue streams from the  US iGaming market, especially in Q3 and 4.

Fears of private  equity lockup expiry fully priced in at this point, but such fears are  unwarranted at these low levels, especially considering Blackstone’s  acquisition of another 37 million shares.

But  here's a question: Has anyone thought about cash conversion of PSFE's  outstanding warrants bringing the company as much as $600 million? The  last SEC filing says there are as many as 53.9 million warrants that  could bring the company $11.50 each upon redemption.  This would more  than double their EBITDA and go a long way towards deleveraging and/or  funding their ""active M&A pipeline.""

Such a huge cash infusion gives them meaningful incentive to eventually  promote the stock price to well above $18, a 60%+ gain from current  levels.

There’s a strategy here and Foley has repeatedly shown he knows exactly how to play his  cards. Like most good things, it takes time."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Tencent Deep Dive Analysis - Amazing Company to Keep an Eye On Hey all, please see below my deep dive analysis on Tencent ($TCEHY). I know Chinese stocks are highly controversial, so it’d be great to hear opinions from both sides.

**What Does Tencent Do?**

* Tencent is the largest company in China and has just way too many businesses and so in this section, I will be focusing on the three you need to know as an investor, which include QQ and WeChat, gaming, and Tencent’s investment portfolio
* **QQ and WeChat**
   * Just as a bit of history, Tencent was founded in 1998 by current CEO Pony Ma and 4 other founders who were college friends
   * Their first product was OICQ which was later renamed to **QQ** and was a messaging application that still exists today and boasts [**more than 606 million monthly active users**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ProductListofTencent.pdf)
   * But the jewel in the crown is **WeChat** which is known as Weixin in China which was launched in 2011 and now serves over [**1.2 billion users**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ProductListofTencent.pdf)
   * These two applications are at the core of Tencent’s business model and drive the entire ecosystem by enabling Tencent to launch a suite of other products like such as games, music, payment transactions, and more. Basically, you can think of WeChat as a super app that combines Facebook, Shopify, Uber, GoogleMaps, WhatsApp, TikTok and a whole lot more.
   * **It’s really hard to overstate the power of WeChat.** I’ve read in my research that even homeless people in China use WeChat to receive money and when I was doing business with suppliers in China for my old business, I only used WeChat to communicate
   * Because of this, **there are just an endless number of ways for Tencent to continue building out its ecosystem** because they can always add new functionalities to WeChat like the TikTok feature they added when they saw TikTok dominating or TenPay to take on Alipay
* **Gaming**
   * Though WeChat is the engine that drives Tencent’s business, **gaming is actually the** [**real money maker and profit driver**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ResultsPresentation.pdf) **for the company**
   * Tencent has been involved in the gaming industry since 2004 and since then has become the **second largest player** **in the world** after Sony with $13.9 billion in revenue
      * The company holds a dominant **43% market share in China** and owns the **top 3 PC games and top 2 mobile games published in 2020**
      * Another important thing to note is that given the PC and console markets have been stalling, **Tencent has been focusing a lot of its attention to mobile gaming,** which now owns roughly **70% market share** of the gaming market
   * **Tencent obviously has a natural advantage with WeChat** given that it’s a mobile app that can be used to market to 1.2 billion users, but another one of Tencent's advantages is **Yingyong Bao** which is also known as Tencent My App and is China’s leading Android app store with [**26% market share**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1058612/china-android-app-store-market-share/)
      * So basically, if you’re a game creator, not only do you have to create a game that competes against the resources and teams Tencent has, but whenever Tencent releases a game, it can automatically market it through WeChat users and feature the app on Tencent My App
      * All of this would result in the game being downloaded more and becoming the number one most downloaded gaming app even though it may not standalone be the best game
   * As a result, it may come as no surprise that Tencent owns a dominant [**52% of China’s mobile gaming market**](https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mobile-games2-1.jpg)
   * **Believe it or not, this is not where the dominance ends.** Just take a look at all the [**investments**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent) Tencent has made in some of the world’s top gaming companies including Riot Games, Supercell, Epic Games, and Activision Blizzard
* **Tencent’s investment portfolio**
   * First of all, it’s important to note that while Tencent does own a majority stake in many businesses, **the company’s investment philosophy is well known to be hands-off** meaning that after they invest, they just let the company do its thing
   * Tencent owns a very impressive portfolio of 800+ companies including 20% of Meituan, 100% of Riot Games, 25.6% of Sea, and even 5% of Tesla
      * Based on the last calculated market value of these companies, Tencent’s ownership from its portfolio is estimated **$331 billion (couldn't provide source link due to subreddit rules)**
      * A large part of Tencent’s growth strategy is inorganic and the company has shown no signs of slowing down

**The Bull Case**

* **Reason #1 - WeChat which is a nearly impenetrable moat that Tencent will enjoy for at least another decade or two**
   * WeChat users spent **$115 billion** **through mini programs in 2019** and exact figures weren’t disclosed in Tencent’s 2020 annual report but I did find that in their report that annual transaction volume from Mini programs doubled in 2020
   * All of this is important because while WeChat is a dominant force, user growth has been slowing given that it already penetrates nearly all of China and so it’ll be important for Tencent to continue monetizing on its users to propel further growth
* In order to not be too repetitive, I won’t touch upon gaming and Tencent’s investment portfolio
* **Reason #2 - Livestreaming**
   * Tencent owns a dominant **37% and 38% stake in China’s largest gaming streaming sites named Huya and Douyu** and has been pushing for the two companies to merge
   * This would remove a lot of the competition between the two platforms which control **90% of the streaming market** but the deal is uncertain to pass due to the heightened antitrust environment
   * But either way, Tencent still owns a commanding share of the two companies and live streaming is a fast growing industry that serves as a **great complement to Tencent’s gaming business**
* **Reason #3 - Tencent's fintech and business services**
   * This is the **fastest growing segment of Tencent’s business** and it grew by 47% year over year in the first quarter of 2021
   * Regarding fintech, Tencent has been able to take considerable share away from Alipay through Tenpay which currently accounts for about **39% of transactions,** which is up from about 10% in 2014
      * **Tenpay is basically like Venmo or Paypal on steroids** and it allows for cashless transactions amongst peers and merchants, while also providing services like loans that are approved within 3 minutes and a whole lot more
      * **Regarding the cloud, Tencent holds the 3rd place spot** in terms of market share and given that the overall industry grew by 62% in Q4 2020, I’m sure Tencent will be putting a lot of efforts into this business segment

**The Bear Case**

* **Reason #1 - Regulatory risk by the Chinese Communist Party or CCP**
   * Unlike Jack Ma who notoriously spoke out against the party and caused many issues for Alibaba, **Tencent is known to have a very strong relationship with the government**
   * Even still, the CCP can at any time change its policies that can hurt Tencent’s business with one such example being in **2018 when the CCP stopped approving gaming licenses for 9 months**
   * There have also been a lot of **antitrust news** and Tencent is expected to pay a fine of around **$1.5 billion for anticompetitive practices** and the CCP can do things like this out of thin air
* **Reason #2 - Political unrest between China and the rest of the world**
   * While President, Trump issued an order to ban WeChat transactions which never actually took effect and was recently **revoked by the Biden administration**
   * Still, the risk remains especially in the case that China grows way too powerful that **countries will work to limit its power,** such as making Tencent sell off its US holdings if an anti-China US president came to power
   * What should be noted though is that **Tencent’s business mostly resides in China (97%),** so there would be notable but minimal impact
* **Reason #3 - WeChat is dominant but slowing in growth**
   * One of the newest and fiercest competitors is **ByteDance** which is the company behind Douyin / Tiktok
   * [**TikTok has over 689 million monthly active users while Douyin has over 600 million,**](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/) and as we’ve seen with WeChat, once you have the users, your opportunities to create additional businesses are endless
   * In a sign of what may be to come, **ByteDance created a hit game** and may be starting to encroach upon Tencent’s gaming dominance
   * That said, Bytedance has a long way to go, having earned just $42 million with its top game vs. hundreds of millions for Tencent and **previous game launches have been unsuccessful**
* **Reason #4 - Tencent trades in the US as a Level 1 ADR**
   * [**Level 1 ADRs trade on OTC markets**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/what-are-differences-between-levels-i-ii-and-iii-american-depository-receipts-adrs.asp) and don’t need to abide by GAAP accounting which result in less reliability and transparency
   * I don’t think that Tencent would commit accounting fraud given that the company is so large now but they are operating with some looser standards and this is something to keep in mind
   * There was also some talk about the US delisting Chinese ADRs so again, this is another risk

**Financials & Valuation**

* Starting off with the [financials](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21CorporateOverview.pdf) (refer to this link for the datapoints I reference below), Tencent is a highly profitable business with an adjusted EBITDA margin that has hovered around 40% for the past few years which is extremely solid
   * The company has just about as much cash as debt and normally you might want to see a larger cash position, but Tencent is generating so much in free cash flow that it really doesn’t matter
   * For instance, the company’s debt to adjusted EBITDA is around 1.3x and for this ratio, about 6.0x is where you would get really worried about being over leveraged and so Tencent is way below that
* Regarding valuation, I’ll be referring to this [table](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4FkTDhVoAAluTO?format=jpg&name=large) and comparing Tencent to its peers (trading comps)
   * Amongst the Chinese peers, we can see that **Tencent’s revenue growth is in the middle of the pack** but its **profitability numbers** aka its EBITDA margin, profit margin, and free cash flow yield **lead the pack**
   * This along with Tencent’s competitive moat and impressive investment portfolio is probably why **Tencent is trading at a premium versus its Chinese peers**
   * **Amongst the U.S. peers,** we see that **Tencent is growing the fastest in revenue while is more in the middle of the pack for profitability**
   * You can also see that Tencent is in the middle of the pack when it comes to multiples vs. its U.S. peers meaning that **Tencent is not cheap vs. its U.S. peers either**
* Based on all this I think Tencent is an amazing business with a nearly impenetrable moat in various industries, but there are a lot of risks investing in Chinese companies, so I’d want to invest in companies that are a bit more discounted so I can have a higher margin of safety
* **Tencent is not the cheapest company vs. its Chinese peers nor its U.S. peers** and so for me, I would want to see Tencent trading at much lower multiples before I invest, probably somewhere around 15x 2022 EBITDA (loosely speaking)
   * This is because I could simply invest in U.S. companies at a better valuation while not taking on the risks that come with investing in Chinese companies
   * That said, if you believe that China will vastly outgrow U.S. companies and are not as sensitive to the risks with Chinese stocks, Tencent’s moat may be enough to warrant an investment with a long-term time horizon

**TLDR:** Tencent with WeChat, its gaming business, and investment portfolio has an incredible moat. That said, the company is not trading cheaply and so personally I would wait for the price to come down a bit before investing. That said, I welcome all counter points and it’d be great to hear your thoughts."
2021-06-17 13:16:46,stocks,"You get the same kneejerk comments on every DD of Chinese stocks, so IDK why people bother writing them anymore. Personally I just drop have a decent portion of my portfolio in VXUS and that's like 10% Alibaba and Tencent.

I think people overstate regulatory risk because they read front page posts re: china and think all it takes to bankrupt Tencent is for Xi to be in a bad mood. 

Short term really depends on whether Tencent gets hit with the 2018 e-commerce and anti-monopoly laws. For some people it's a question of how hard they get hit instead. 

Long term IMO it's a decently safe investment. But then again you might as well buy international indices."
2021-06-17 10:41:30,stocks,"I have a few personal and professional rules I like to live by. 

When it comes to stocks - “Don’t invest or gamble on Chinese companies” reigns supreme. American companies and the SEC are nowhere near perfect but at least in the US we don’t need to worry about the CEO mysteriously disappearing for months on hand after critiquing the government. The lack of stringent regulations and widespread state ownership/control is enough for me to never even think about owning a Chinese stock.

DD or revenue is irrelevant to me when sales can be fraudulently created (Ex: Luckin)"

I don't think you can outright discount the regulatory dangers of the Chinese government has on its industry. It doesn't help that the CCP operates in a black box situation, which is very different then how any Western government operates. But Tencent and Alibaba are great companies with awesome growth potential, and I hope those who directly invest do well on their holdings."

If you're smart, you're not putting all your eggs in the US basket, nor the China basket.

You play both sides.

If you're a professional investor without any China exposure, from a fiduciary perspective, you're doing your investors wrong.

You can either swallow the Sinophobic narrative, fight against the CCP and wear yourselves out fighting. Or you can go along for the ride and let the CCP make you rich, as you live a nice life here in the States."
2021-06-17 14:27:49,stocks,"I think this is very far from the truth. The political landscape in China is quite different from the West. The method is different because the culture and people mindset are different. But ultimately, the government and the people in China want the same thing as everyone: Long term prosperity for the country with fair and open market for the people.

The reason that CCP clamped down on Alibaba is because they exploited their dominant position to make profit. It is no difference than US or EU clamped down on Google and Facebook with many fines before. 

I find it funny when EU fined Google 1.4b$, it's is justice against evil corporation; but CCP fined Alibaba, it's evil government tried to control the market."

I don’t have investors that rely on my choices (Maybe my dog) and I do have global exposure. But my desire to not own stock in a Chinese state owned company is not a new or uncommon one. Again, look at what happened to Alibaba and Luckin."
2021-06-17 15:20:46,stocks,Very good post.
2021-06-17 12:55:25,stocks,"There's a gulf of difference between interventional government actions between the American government and the Chinese government.

The American market anti-monopoly bills and growing anti-Big Tech sentiment has been slow and predictable, and priced into a lot of valuation. The fact that of the big 5 bills being called into action, targeting firms like Google or Amazon, hasn't stopped either's growth projections. It'll take years for those bills to work their way through the various levels of the American government before they can even be enforced, plenty of time for investors and traders to model company valuations. This isn't even factoring that Big Tech firms hold more political power than ever, and can directly lobby against government action with better results than ever.

A break-up of a company of say Amazon wouldn't even be a big factor to many investors, as shareholders would either get shares of the new company or the premium of the sell-off would increase the stock price to go up. This happened to AT&T back in 1984, when it was forced to spin-off large parts of its business. After the break-up, AT&T had a huge bull run from 1984 to 2000, going from $6 a share in 1984 to its peak of $57 in the 2000 DotCom crash. \*EDIT\* AT&T's bull run doesn't even take in for account its [3 stock splits it had between 1984 to 2000.](https://investors.att.com/stock-information/historical-stock-information/historical-stock-splits/att-inc) AT&T printed money.

China is a different story. China is still inexperienced with dealing with it's Big Tech firms. The government realizes their tech industry is part of its path to economic domination, but now is dealing with the fallout: mega-rich tech billionaires with political clout and worldwide popularity.

I agree with you on US politics, and how the megacorporations are about as powerful as any state government. They continue to erode human rights and dodge investing back into the country that allows them to be megacorporations.

But it comes down to being predictably evil. The American business landscape is predictable enough that I can DCA into VTI every month, knowing that VTI will continue to grow a steady pace. The American government will broadcast its intentions on shitty 24/7 new channels, takes entire election cycles to pass laws. But I don't know if we can get that sort of predictability from the Chinese government at this point of time.

The CCP operate in a black box: there is no openness in how it operates, what it's current concerns are, or when it was enforce its edicts. It can crack down on a company with no warning, and prop up a law without having to gain public goodwill.

This is like saying investing in the American market is being pro-American. I'm a Canadian and have no love for the American government. But I can safely say that the American government is open with its procedures and public momentum.

>June 17 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Cloud on Thursday said Google will offer cloud computing services based on AMD's newest data center chip, a move likely to intensify AMD's push to grab market share from rival Intel Corp (INTC.O).

>Cloud computing providers such as Google, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are some of the biggest buyers of data center chips. They build services on top of the chips to rent the computing power out to millions of customers.

>Google said on Thursday it will start offering services based on AMD's ""Milan"" server chip, which AMD released in March. Google said customers such as Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) are testing the new AMD-based services.

>AMD has been gaining market share against Intel, which was long the dominant player in data center chips but whose offerings have inferior performance on some measures because of years of stumbles in Intel's manufacturing operations.

>Intel in April announced its ""Ice Lake"" chip competitor to AMD's ""Milan"" chip and said all major cloud providers would support it, but Intel has not said when Google will start offering services based on its latest chip.

2021-06-17 19:52:54,stocks,This is the way.
2021-06-17 16:47:14,stocks,"intel has changed leadership and is focusing on new architecture for their cpus which can be a game changer. 

AMD is making a lot of positive moves but AMD is also fractured with a lot of fingers in many different cookie jars. Their platform is schismed between all of their different endeavors - CPU & GPU. That's great to get money but that means the majority of their time is beholden to partner R&D. Chips for tesla, chips for sony, chips for microsoft, but nothing to push themselves to #1.

Intel isn't what it once was but they still have a marginable lead. Anyone saying otherwise is playing favorites in favor of AMD and not being realistic."
2021-06-17 16:47:41,stocks,"I dont have any position in intel personally, just a small handful of amd stocks. Wasnt really planning on buying intel either, I was just curious about your reasoning. 

I dont believe intel will go anywhere personally, and think theres a place at the table for a cheaper mediocre chip in consumer electronics. 

Thanks for your insight."
2021-06-17 19:34:37,stocks,Apart from that they make way more money for every share holder than all there competition?
2021-06-17 18:11:10,stocks,"I didn't write your whole comment is wrong, but I said it's not *entirely true* either. Nvidia will be releasing a CPU, yes or no? So to say ""they're not in the CPU market"" isn't actually correct anymore, is it?

To say ""they're not competing with AMD or INTC"" (not INTL!) is not true either since in their promo of their ARM acquisition they actually reference this, saying they are going to ""offer an alternative CPU architecture to x86"". See: arm.nvidia.com

Thirdly, it is absolutely the first time they are actually leveraging their ARM acquisition because instead of just licensing their IP they developed the architecture together. Jensen Huang actually referenced this at the Developer Conference announcement.

Last point: Fair enough, the rally could be because of the stock split too but that's not adding any value at all to the company which is why I'd favour a different explanation. I'm sure it's a number of factors."
2021-06-17 16:58:08,stocks,yeah intel will not go anywhere. they are solid but will not grow like amd and nvidia.
2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Struggling with knowing when to take profits I’m still fairly new to trading (< 1 year) and I’ve consistently struggled with knowing when to take profits due to greed and FOMO. What is everyone’s strategies for profit taking? I’m currently struggling with whether or not to sell NET. I own 115 shares and my total profit is $3k. Last year I didn’t sell when it got to its then ATH of $95 and it went all the way back down to me being in the red $1k just from this stock and I’d rather not hold it through another cycle so I’m thinking I should sell it, but I also don’t want to miss out on profits if it continues to take off."
2021-06-17 11:06:29,stocks,It's the last part after the last comma that does you in. It's not knowing when to take profits that you have an issue with. It's your inability to be happy with any profits. Straight fomo shit.
2021-06-17 10:36:02,stocks,"I don’t know anything about the company you invested in, but always have an exit strategy. 

It’s also very easy to look back and tell when you should have sold - as the saying goes “hindsight is 20/20”. 

When you buy something, you buy it because you believe the company to be undervalued. So that should mean you should also know when it’s fairly valued and overvalued. 

If you bought the company as a long term investment, it might not even be worth looking at when something is overvalued currently to make a quick buck. 

If you’re looking to hold short term, then selling a company that’s overvalued is not a bad thing. This makes all the more reason to be valuing companies when making investments/ trades. Blindly buying and selling hoping that it’ll go up is just speculating/ gambling. There is nothing wrong with it, it’s your money, but if that is the case then the answer to knowing when to take profits should either be “the moment you make profit” or “you don’t”."
2021-06-17 10:01:32,stocks,If you think it's going to go higher take half to three quarters off and let the rest ride. And watch it like a hawk
2021-06-17 11:00:50,stocks,"Trading requires a strategy.  All successful traders use a system with rules for entry and exit points, and they stick to those rules religiously.  Otherwise you get stuck like you are now, not knowing when to sell and risking the loss of all your profits."
2021-06-17 14:57:27,stocks,"My strategy is this. Diversify between dividend stocks (~30%),multi-year long-term growth (~50%), and short/mid-term growth (20%)

Speaking solely on my short/mid-term stocks, here is how I determine when to take profits:
  -hold for minimum a year to get long-term capital gains tax
  -If stock goes up 100% in that time, in most cases, sell and get realized gains to then find new potential stock to invest in.
  -If not over 100% refresh on due diligence to see if still worth holding or worth taking less profit or the loss.
  -If stock goes up 1000% automatically sell regardless if it's been less than a year and take normal income tax hit. Reinvest in different company.

This is just a very basically written understanding of my strategy.

Don't worry about missing out on gains you never realized. It's going to happen. Just build out your own strategy and as long as you make some money over time, you're succeeding at it. If you get hung up on money you never actually had, then you'll continually be miserable Also, learn from past mistakes and readjust your strategy as needed. I've adjusted mine several times."
2021-06-17 10:41:01,stocks,"I’m more of a buy and hold type of person, but if you want to trade NET, or any other stock for that matter, chart out support resistance lines, look at moving averages. If a stock breaks a clear uptrend or support, that’s usually a signal to sell if you’re trading. Good luck :)"
2021-06-17 10:41:54,stocks,"I find it helpful to know what percentage each investment makes up of your portfolio, and whether you’re comfortable with that percentage. For instance, if you had 5 stocks with the same amount invested in each, you’d have 20% in each stock. Then let’s say one of those stocks shoots up 300%. Now it makes up 28% of your portfolio. You could either sell off that 8% to bring it in line with your other investments, or decide that you want to stay at that higher percentage. 

If NET is your only stock, or makes up a large percent of your portfolio, you need to decide whether you’re comfortable with that risk. Diversification reduces risk. So i’d suggest trimming back to a percentage you’re more comfortable with and try to maintain that percentage. If the stock goes up, trim. If it goes back down, you can add."
2021-06-17 11:45:49,stocks,"Does it help to know that nobody knows when to sell? Or when to buy either.
You must set your convictions and stick to them. Looking back typically hurts."
2021-06-17 11:52:54,stocks,"Consider stop limit orders. With the given example you are up 3000 and you don’t want to go back to negative. Set a stop sell order to some profit that you like to keep. Say 1000. (I would think in percentages instead.) So if it falls down there you automatically take your 1000 profit and exit. If it goes to 5000 move your limit to 3000. Something like this, numbers are up to you."
2021-06-17 15:53:36,stocks,"""I’d rather not hold it through another cycle.""

This means you should sell.  It will go down again and it will go up again.  I'm in NET for the long haul.  They are a smart company with a good product and are positioned brilliantly.  But yeah, it will most likely correct again before it steadies back up. 

I suppose you could sell but leave a bit in so you can have a moral victory if it does go up but not sure that's the most efficient use of your money."
2021-06-17 17:18:04,stocks,"Taking profits doesn't mean closing the position.  It means (in a sense) reducing your risk exposure.  All else being equal, diminishing returns are a thing, and especially if the position is as volatile as you say it is, experience has already taught you to take some of your winnings and put them somewhere safer.  Now you're stuck asking whether you should eat a loss instead of take profit, and that's not very good.

So... as for this particular position, nobody can tell you what to do next, but in any position you take after this one, USE THIS LESSON."
2021-06-17 11:52:39,stocks,"Your decision to buy or sell should have nothing to do with being up or down or what has happened to the stock price before today.  The stock price today is either undervalued, fairly valued or overvalued, don’t complicated it with hindsight or emotions."
2021-06-17 11:36:49,stocks,Set achievable goals and have a plan to move it around!
2021-06-17 12:32:01,stocks,"Set your own price target based off of your own DD and estimations. If it hits price target, sell. If not hold. Don't cry if it goes higher, you hit your price target. Some profit is better than no profit. You can never time the market, if everyone could, we'd all be rich."
2021-06-17 12:32:15,stocks,Use limit calls.
2021-06-17 13:50:32,stocks,"Lots of good advice here so I'll just add this. Take some profit, not all. On stocks I'd like to keep long term, I'll sell a portion of to take some profit and let the rest ride. My ideal scenarios are when I sell enough to cover my initial investment and let the rest ride. It's a phycological trick in that since you get all your investment back, everything else is house money."
2021-06-17 14:03:44,stocks,"if the cycle eventually comes back up and higher why not hold and forget? you potentially miss buyign back in.

you're timing the market and cycle is not guaranteed. because something happened in the past does mean it will happen again. I've been caught in this thinking a few times and learned my lesson. you can't watch something dip and surge and dip and surge and dip and buy certain it will surge."
2021-06-17 15:10:46,stocks,"i have 4500 invested in a robo advisor account that has grown to 5300 (variety of deposits, currently set at $350 a month). should i take that 800 out and let my original total investment grow again?"
2021-06-17 16:18:57,stocks,If it makes it easier to hold then sell some of your profitable stock.
2021-06-17 17:43:03,stocks,"If a stock doubles, sell half.

If a fund and you like....ride it out.

Anyways, you get your nut back on first one and can decide how to reap rewards later as they are now free of stress....you got your nut back.

Funds are more simple. If you like the direction and initial investment, hold. If not, sell anytime for a profit and research again."
2021-06-17 18:33:06,stocks,"It is harder if you are trading in a taxable account, but if you aren't...

Sell at the end of one day, think about it overnight, than buy on the open."
2021-06-17 12:30:22,stocks,",,, you an the rest of the world.

here's what I know about you so far,,, you jumped into the market with out first reading 5 or 6 books on, How to invest and you didn't take any on line courses on, How to invest. Example: Udemy. com, it's cheap. 

If you had done the above you would know how to set up an exit strategy an wouldn't be asking total strangers for advice.

Here's some other bad news, this is a Bull market, a very strong one. Even idiots can make money in this market. So don't confuse making money durring a Bull market with being smart. It almost all cases, it's dumb luck.

2021-06-17 11:53:34,stocks,I’ve mostly been buying tech but isn’t all of it overvalued?
2021-06-17 13:08:53,stocks,"Never said I was smart at investing/ trading, I’m fully aware it’s a bull market"
2021-06-17 11:16:32,stocks,don't look at the profits. Look at the company you own. Ask yourself if you believe it will continue to grow into the future as a business. You are owning a business after all.
2021-06-17 18:05:38,stocks,Ask yourself ‘would I buy this stock right now’. If the answer is ‘yes’- buy more or keep holding.  If the answer is ‘no’ sell it and don’t look back.
2021-06-17 11:51:17,stocks,"There are basically two types of systems traders use:

1) Profit targets (e.g., sell as soon as you hit 10% profit)

2) Technical targets (e.g., if you're buying a pattern breakout, there are usually rules for estimating potential gains)"
2021-06-17 18:05:09,stocks,">I’m in between investing and trading

2021-06-17 11:59:27,stocks,"However you chose to divide stocks into groups; each group will contain stocks that are overvalued and stocks that are undervalued at any moment.  There are Tech stocks worthy of investment now; but yes, there are likely many more that are not."
2021-06-17 17:19:15,stocks,"If it is, why are you buying it?"
2021-06-17 17:36:15,stocks,Because I don’t think it valuation means anything anymore
2021-06-17 17:51:32,stocks,"Yet in buying it, you clearly think its valuation is going to go *up*.  That's not really consistent with believing the current price is meaningless."
2021-06-17 17:58:18,stocks,What I mean is that nobody cares if a stock is over valued. Me thinking a stock is over valued is not going to prevent me from buying it. Apple is overvalued yet I still bought 100 shares because in the long term I think it’ll grow.
2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"You come into a (relatively) large sum of money. What next? Say you somehow received a large sum of money relative to your pay check.  How do you go about investing it in this market environment? Do you lump sum into an index fund 2-3 times in the next year? DCA every month? Save half for a market downturn? 
Add to this you’re a student and don’t expect much monthly income at all in the coming months. 

All this assuming you don’t need it for living expenses of course"

2021-06-17 09:04:07,stocks,Post about it on my favorite internet message board
2021-06-17 14:26:06,stocks,"Like many of the questions here, you failed to give the key details that would allow for meaningful responses.  How much money?  $10,000 ?  $100,000 ?  1,000,000 ?  What are your goals?  Risk tolerance?  Overall family financial situation?  Credit card debt?

The first rule of asset management is ""don't lose what you already have"".  I would suggest paying off over-priced credit card debt first, if you have any.  Then you can gradually move some of it into large diversified ETFs, like those tracking the S&P 500.  Keep a $5,000 cash emergency fund for yourself in the bank, if you don't already have one."
2021-06-17 09:13:20,stocks,Pick 5 stocks. Divide the sum by 104. Invest 1/104th every week for 2 years in those 5

2021-06-17 08:52:38,stocks,"Depends what you are comfortable with. A friend of mine is going to be in the same situation, he has no experience with investing so I told him to buy some books and start with etf's, maybe dividend stocks.

I'm gonna sell my appartment in NL to live in a poor country, cause said friend has his girlfriend there, and can live from what he is getting. I'm going to buy stocks with it, cause that's what I do with my current savings.

Also how much are we talking about? Enough to live off? Enough to buy a house? Or 10k?And what's your goal? Go on holiday off your profits everyday? Never work a day in your life again?

You could take more risk with 10k than with a million."
2021-06-17 09:14:04,stocks,"Find a few cheaper stocks that interest you. Invest on the small side and follow it hard for at least 4 months. You will learn tons that way.

2021-06-17 16:40:01,stocks,"Scalp even smaller profit margins, if a stock is $5 and my account is 1million, then I can afford 200,000 shares.

2021-06-17 08:54:40,stocks,"Depends, i wouldn't pay off a cheap 20/30 years fixed rate on a house. But if you got loans on a car for example yes."
2021-06-17 10:27:54,stocks,"I see a 20/30 year fixed rate home loan as good debt a car is bad debt, a car goes down in value a home over time goes up."
2021-06-17 19:57:34,stocks,"Yeah but let’s say you have the money for a car, if you finance it at 3% and have a better way to deploy the funds, the opportunity cost isn’t the ownership of the car. The car is an expense regardless, but if you have the money and just deploy it elsewhere, it is just a form of leverage with cheap debt.

Edit: basically the asset that secures the debt has nothing to do with the opportunity cost. If it’s a house, or a car, it doesn’t matter, what matters is how you deploy the capital elsewhere, instead and what the cost of capital is."
2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"My Inflation Hedge broke... As did my brain.

So I have a SLV position I was using in part to hedge vs inflation... I mean precious metals gain in value during inflationary times, but here we are today and both GLD and SLV are dropping like stones.

When did we get a disconnect between inflation and metals? I suppose its been a decade or so since I last had to deal with this particular risk but WTF.

And TLT is heading upward! Mindboggling!"
2021-06-17 08:41:14,stocks,Inflation good for precious metals. Higher interest rates bad for them. So if the cure for inflation is higher rates then the overall outlook is bad for stocks and precious metals. Hello bonds. So if bond yield rises we know.

2021-06-17 10:14:39,stocks,"I bought Silver at 36$/oz back in 2009 before it tanked, so don’t feel too bad.

Precious metals correlate more to macro volatility than to inflation expectations. You’d only see silver and gold take off if there was doubt Central Banks could get things under control, like a hyperinflation scenario or a deflationary event.

If you really wanted to hedge against inflation, you should just short TLT, there’s so much going on in PM markets it’s exhausting.

Or if you fell down the rabbit hole, realized there is no inflation, you’d have TLT calls like I do."
2021-06-17 08:44:24,stocks,Fed announcement yesterday that rates will rise twice in 2023 usd strengthened  all commodities are in usd meaning they went down. Don’t panic it’s not that inflation isn’t a real issue because it is. If people start to see it increase pace more people like you will buy gold / silver that demand should push it up. Also as more stimulus is announced usd should soften meaning commodities will go up. I am using this as an opportunity to add to my position personally. Once usd stops appreciating or levels off might be a good opportunity to add as the trend in usd is down. Follow DXY it’s the USD index. Don’t panic sell at a loss I would add personally. I don’t think the commodity boom is over just fed policy has created expectations that usd securities in the future will provide higher returns driving dollar demand. Also not a PHD economist so happy to learn others opinions.
2021-06-17 09:03:09,stocks,"PMs are typically correlated with inflation / rates, but really they are just speculative, its supply and demand that determines the price. The fear around inflation was hyped up the past few weeks in anticipation of some random fed meeting, which ending up being nothing, so I believe some of the hype is blowing off temporarily."
2021-06-17 15:16:22,stocks,"So first of all, JP Morgan collects the shit out of those ETF's in fees. Even if we had inflation jump to 5% you'd get fucked because of it. Also, and this is *super* important, but JP Morgan owns all the silver and gold. And in the contract, they *always* have the option to buy out 'fair market' value for the metals. Practically, this is like what happened in the US with gold. The US locked in the exchange rate which disconnected it from the market.

A way to envision this is imagine a time where we get a massive inflation spike. Lets say after the spike it says $1000 for an ounce of silver. But no one will sell you an ounce for $100 even though that is the 'market' price. The true price is infinity because existing dollars are now considered worthless. The market has disconnected. What JP Morgan can now do is pay off every SLV holder $1000 for each share of SLV they own, which is meaningless when the $1000 buys them nothing.

Of course that's an extreme example and the odds of the US currency collapsing like that is basically impossible. But a less extreme version of this can happen where holders of SLV still get fucked, just a little less fucked."
2021-06-17 08:45:39,stocks,"Precious metals have an inverse correlation with rates. The market is forward looking and it sees a 2% 10yr by the send end of the year. Also, the market believes inflation is transitory. Therefore big money is decreasing exposure to gold and silver and even (c)rypto. 

5% cash 5% gold 5% bonds 5% (c)rypto. That’s my hedge."
2021-06-17 09:21:43,stocks,It's still a good inflation hedge.  You just need to stop looking at it
2021-06-17 10:08:09,stocks,"Precious metals only go up if inflation is expected to be high and yields low. Powell just opened the door to possible 2023 hikes so there goes your gold appeal.

If you want silver exposure go to PSLV, it's an etf that is actually backed by physical silver, not that paper only future market crap."
2021-06-17 08:55:48,stocks,It's due to interest rates rising...
2021-06-17 11:08:04,stocks,"Not mindboggling. Forecasted rate hikes mean runaway inflation is something that will be contained by the Fed and will not be allowed to occur. The street believes so, I believe so, people getting rid of GLD and SLV believe so."
2021-06-17 13:20:33,stocks,"check commodities, there is inflation but a big part of it was from the supply constraint that is getting lower and lower"
2021-06-17 10:21:50,stocks,"just to add, higher rates can lead to the USD strengthening, which is also bad for gold/silver (makes them more expensive)"

2021-06-17 10:56:05,stocks,I was just as shocked by that run up. But since it was in my favor it resulted in a different emotional reaction... and the selling of some 27 strike calls.

Honestly it looks like Stagflation... rising cost stagnant wages.

Oh and ouch on the $36 silver."

2021-06-17 09:39:50,stocks,"It would be nice if they raised rates back to where they were before the subprime fiasco.

Let's say the 10 year hits 2% again.

What that means is you can loan the government money (let's say 1000 bucks) and they will pay you 2% per year (20 bucks for this example) for 10 years.

You owe taxes on the 2% and if inflation (or worse yet CPI) is over 2% you functional are loaning money at a significant loss.

If bonds paid 5 to 6% and inflation is 2% you can make money on the deal. Years ago it was easy money at that."

2021-06-17 10:12:22,stocks,"Yeah well sounds like a data scandal and ""leak"" waiting to happen. But of course if you want to do that then fair enough."
2021-06-17 10:21:48,stocks,They have one of the tightest security policies and transparency with the consumer is unmatched. Have you actually looked into this at all? Or just speaking nonsense?
2021-06-17 11:18:39,stocks,You have a lot of faith in cyber security I see

2021-06-17 13:16:36,stocks,"Fair enough. But they actually have really good data policies that I wish more companies followed, take a look when you have spare time!"
2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"When company insiders award themselves stock - this is bad, right? I own $CNNB which is a small regional bank stock traded on NASDAQ. The stock has done well in the last year rising from $7 to $14 per share. I’m looking at insider transactions, and in late May and early June, 10 insiders (president, CFO, directors etc.) were given a stock award of anywhere between 3,000 to 12,000 shares. To me, for a small regional bank this seems excessive. 

Should this make me think about selling the stock? Is this standard practice and nothing to worry about (within the norm)?"
2021-06-17 07:24:43,stocks,"Atleast in larger companies this practice is normal.  This is usually a performance bonus.  It also makes upper management care about stock price performance, because they are directly impacted themselves."
2021-06-17 08:21:52,stocks,So the theory is that it is good because that usually replaces part of the normal compensation so the company isn't spending cash.  It also theoretically ties the executives to the performance of the stock so that their interests align with the shareholders interests as it is now in their best interest to see the stock go higher.
2021-06-17 08:53:22,stocks,It’s when they sell these shares you should get out.
2021-06-17 07:36:33,stocks,"I love my company stock, its part of my employment contract.  There should be a vesting period too so they can’t just sell them all right away."
2021-06-17 07:32:10,stocks,They’ve been doing it for a long time. Insider trading and bonuses aren’t really a bad thing. Doing it over excessively IMO is a bad sign but you’ll most likely never know. It’s really up to yourself to look into the situation. Also how is this a small company? Around 21000 employees and over 1100 banking centers?
2021-06-17 07:44:17,stocks,"I doesn’t matter to me how the company compensates their executives; whether cash, stocks, Teslas or donuts. The net impact on the share holders is the same."
2021-06-17 08:15:32,stocks,The board don’t decide their own compensation. The shareholders have to vote on that. Right?
2021-06-17 07:30:59,stocks,but would u say this is good or bad?
2021-06-17 08:35:19,stocks,"Great answer, thank you!"
2021-06-17 07:35:21,stocks,You must be looking at the wrong company. The stock represents Cincinnati Federal Bank and Kentucky Federal Bank which has 80 employees and 7 branches. They used to be part of a larger conglomerate that was called by the same name (Cincinnati Bancorp).
2021-06-17 07:59:21,stocks,You don't worry when outstanding shares increase by 100% in the span of 5 months?
2021-06-17 07:34:15,stocks,"In my company, it is good.  The full stock bonus is paid 20% per year over 5 years.  Upper management are now stock owners who are looking at mid term performance."
2021-06-17 07:34:35,stocks,As a investor this is up to yourself to decide. Some people will look at it as a nice bonus for hard 2020 year. Some people will look at it like it has a corrupt board that only thinks about themselves. Up to you as a shareholder to figure out if you like the company and want to invest in it.
2021-06-17 08:22:46,stocks,The stock represents Bancorp. Bancorp is the holding company that possesses all the shares of Cincinnati federal. The stock your buying represents Cincinnati Bancorp. Litterally the name of the company for that ticker is Cincinnati Bancorp. (PS. Not arguing. Just intrigued by this now and wanting to figure it out for myself as well lol)
2021-06-17 11:05:21,stocks,"I don’t believe there is a reference to that in this thread.  If the Board of Directors chooses to compensate Executives $10,000,000.00, I don’t care how they do it, cash, stock, or whatever. I believe that is the question in this case. The value of what the shareholders own is decreasing by $10,000,000.00 regardless.

If the question is should the Executives be compensated $10,000,000.00 in the first place, that is a different question with a different answer."
2021-06-17 08:36:34,stocks,"Sure it took me awhile to figure it out myself, but even on Robinhood it lists the # of employees as 70, would send a screenshot but sub doesn’t allow"
2021-06-17 12:55:08,stocks,robinhood's # employees is not accurate in many cases.  i would not trust it.

Price likely to exceed $30, considering SOFI is so undervalued compared to other fintechs..
just one example: larger earnings and growth forecast than Robinhood, which is set to go public with a $40B valuation this summer (which will likely grow $60B off a first day of trading 50% jump).
Even at $40.. SOFI would have a market cap below $35B.

You just sign-in and you're on a secure WAN where any given application can be deployed to nearby AWS Outposts and/or Local Zones for very low latency remote work and you only pay for the data and compute you use.

What I'm confused about is why my unrealized gain/loss is at a loss when I have a lower average than today's closing price?

I figure if it ends up ITM and my shares sell, I'll just buy more NET.  If it somehow ends up OTM, I guess i'll be opening more covered calls on it, lol."

2021-06-17 11:11:18,stocks,"Just exited a sizable position fully in Fast Retailing (FRCOY) which I've held since May of last year.

Going to put that money to work in American Eagle (AEO) for a couple reasons.

&#x200B;

1. Fast/Uniqlo offerings more winter focused (thermals, sweats, activewear, tech) while American Eagle/Aerie more summer focused (lounge, swim, underwear) and we are set to have the hottest summer on record
2. Uniqlo's business is primarily Asia focused. We are seeing hiccups in vaccination/reopening efforts currently in Asia, foot traffic has actually declined, while America is reopened fully and consumer spending is way up, and foot traffic is WAY up. Uniqlo heavily depends on foot traffic for sales, while AE has really beefed up its online business, especially in Aerie. It now makes up 40% of sales, increasing over 150% yoy.
3. I see momentum in Aerie's underwear business, and give them a **really plausible shot to overtake Victoria's Secret for number one in market share in seven years,** assuming a 50% growth rate and constant decay thereafter. Uniqlo has a very weak underwear business
4. I see momentum in AEO's jeans business, and **we are entering the first jeans ""supercycle"" in 20 years, as skinnies are going out in a big way, and relaxed/flare/boyfriend/mom/wide leg styles come back for the first time since the 70s.** Remember since the last time more relaxed styles came back, they dominated for around 25 years, as jeans focused brands Gap/A&F/Aeropostale/Express etc. had their first heyday. AEO has a good selection of more popular styles today, while I see Uniqlo is still focused on skinnies, even as skinnies = new mom jeans. I see a jeans retail boom coming and lasting for the next decade as styles rapidly change.
5. AEO has a lower PE and forward PE than other retail clothing comparables in my set: FRCOY (Uniqlo), GPS (Gap), LEVI (Levi Strauss), ANF (Abercrombie and Fitch), LB (L Brands/Victoria's Secret), LULU (Lululemon)"

I plan to hold long long term but I would have thought it would be a lot higher by now.

Meanwhile Facebook is up over 35% since January, despite so much fear of losing profit from Apple's privacy stance. Could it just be that instead of AAPL having a correction it's trading sideways? Like a long drawn out correction?"

You could perhaps argue that it might form a third rounded top however (which is something I've said I don't want to see), but I suspect it's going to flag like it did in the last half of March (where you could argue that it was forming a shoulder, but instead, that time period was a bull flag)."

2021-06-17 11:32:08,stocks,"If you're betting on equities, especially growth, you're betting on a slow, controlled ride up that will end in a slow, controlled ride down to innocuous levels in the next  3-4 years. You're betting on inflation that is transitory, as well as debt levels that don't provide much headwinds, except for when the time for tapering comes, which again won't be brusque or problematic.

The other option is to bet that things won't be as slow, controlled, or benign as the Fed is predicting.  You would be putting hedges in place for inflation and for a taper tantrum, and also sitting on a decent cash position in order to scoop up better deals on equities in the event of an uncontrolled collapse due to Fed inaction or irresponsible decision making, or simply due to unforseen and uncontrollable variables. 

This is a trend right now in the way we think we understand the world: we think we can understand everything like a simple math problem.  That's why 2008 went unpredicted (at least by the mainstream thinkers).  That's why scientists were allowed to make stronger strains of a deadly, highly-contagious virus in a lab in Wuhan.  And that's why right now everyone believes that the Fed can go on with unprecedented credit creation without any possibility of unforeseen or unintended consequences arising.

Humility is lacking in the way we understand complex adaptive systems, and it's an accident waiting to happen."

(STLA) is aiming for the stars following the combination of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot. The company has said they are looking to be on the ""offensive"" in 2021 when it comes to vehicle electrification and autonomous automobiles, two of the hottest plays in the market, yet investors have given the stock little notice. The company also has a form of mobile software within their portfolio of brands through Free2Move and Leasys bringing a unique aspect. Furthermore, as money shifts from high growth tech to more mature growth with value, STLA may be the perfect addition to your portfolio.

2021-06-17 14:18:02,stocks,"I am swing trading Nvidia, while its a risk i already did capture insane profits on it on selling. Problem it is that it also rose with the stock split announcement which would make it irrational rise, it also participates in all tech rises and is currently way above valuation than their tech peers.

Problem with AMD is that its all time high is 	99,23, sure it might reverse from insane increase today, but it also might slowly go even higher and start scratching its ceiling, if it does that i would be stuck with dick in my hands.

What i wanted to say is i would gladly swing all big tech i have, but i don't have a case on any but Nvidia. For example any other tech could start releasing news in tech bullish times and that can send a stock to the moon, missing out on these news would be the biggest risk, that is why long term holds in big tech are long term holds mostly for me, unless something gets seriously out of line like Nvidia.

Of course if the stocks yeet up and stay there, there is no satisfying buying back into them.

Simply said, has not swinged enough to be worth the stress."

2021-06-17 10:46:26,stocks,Are inflation expectations going up? Inflation has likely been priced in over the past several months

2021-06-17 11:21:27,stocks,"AAPL has a lot of cool shit in the pipeline. I think their earnings are going to smash expectations in the next year. They’ve been pretty stagnant for months now, so the current increase isn’t really indicative of anything that will amaze me unless it breaks $140."

2021-06-17 14:12:13,stocks,Lol. Right?
2021-06-17 14:38:23,stocks,Holy Moly.  I added to my watch list at 11+ and was going to pull the trigger but got a work call.  Come back later to see it jump to 13+.  Dang!  hehe.

Not entirely sure what to do now. I thought for sure we were going to see a dip today with futures looking so bleak last night and early morning.

2021-06-17 08:04:43,stocks,It’s funny how you said few ‘red weeks’ when gme/amc  are only down this week and up significantly a couple of weeks ago. You see how you exaggerate you’re comment the same way as those wsber you laugh at? Don’t go to those level.

2021-06-17 15:47:26,stocks,The memes are such a small part of the market so no one will give a shit. Reddit’s really driven people to think that all of wall street is so over levered on this small handful of companies. Only ppl blown put are the hedge funds and reddit retail playing them. Breaking news. Hedge funds go down all the time. Look at archegos. And the market keeps going.

2021-06-17 09:40:59,stocks,I haven’t used TD Ameritrade but is there an option for GTC instead of end of day when you place the limit order? That means good til cancelled and as the name suggests that order will remain in place until it’s either fulfilled or you cancel it.

Because I know good and well you likely get one more big push from the bloody sectors and it's going to sock everything when that time comes, which will be pretty soon."

1. Even if he happens to be right, he's early again.
2. Even if he happens to be right, there's still little chance that the fed funds rate is raised until AT THE VERY EARLIEST sometime in 2022, and it is simply not that likely that they do it aggressively whenever the time does come (which was one of the problems in 2000 I believe).
3. This dude was rambling on about Weimar hyperinflation before he got banned from twitter (even though he's apparently back now), and somebody has said that he apparently fell down the QAnon hole. 

At least for now, I'm not concerned about hyperinflation, and I don't tilt toward being a populist, so all in all, even if Burry is a smart dude...couldn't care less about what he has to say atm."
2021-06-17 19:14:22,stocks,It’s not fud. Dude is probably autistic and he has a world view. Just because it doesn’t jive with yours doesn’t make it fud. He couldnt care less about your positions given what he’s worth.

2021-06-17 17:06:16,stocks,It’s no different than the high price sustained by GameStop. When so many have buy-ins that are so high they don’t sell which keeps the stock up in the hope it’ll do the 🚀 thing again.

Basically when you're young and doing this to learn (with a small amount of money), it is totally valid to just pick a company you know and then use that as a launchpad to learn the ins and outs of following their charts, reading up on financials, watching the ups and downs of the market. 

Don't put more money in until you've played with that 100 euros for many months AND you've done your homework learning the basics of the market. Don't YOLO. Don't panic sell. No FOMO."

Eagle Tree still owns 54 million shares, and are contractually obliged to sell most of them in the next few years (I think it's the next 5, but not 100 percent)."
2021-06-17 08:47:58,stocks,I’d say so. It was pumped by Reddit. It’s a solid company that is a bit undervalued now and should be a great long hold.

2021-06-17 10:21:03,stocks,Everyone realized that the FED isn't going to raise rates until 2022-2023. That is a long time to keep treading water for gains? I say all of this as a question/statement because I'm obviously just an average joe like yourself.

Lumber and building materials are already coming down. Oil prices are cooling off just a smidge. Energy prices are largely seasonal so it’s no surprise that it’s more expensive now than it was 3 months ago. Corn futures are lower now, and I think/hope we’ll see food come down a little as well.

Semis/chips and used cars are probably somewhere in the docket to get supply boosted. I’m very curious what CPI and PPI look like in 2-3 months. It’s very possible that we see it trend back down to an only-barely-uncomfortable actual of 3ish percent, possibly lower by then."

Indirectly related to stocks, unfortunately lots of people will be homeless and with home costs rising (still) they'll either move in with friends/family, sleep in cars, or change locations entirely. 

Many retail property owners on the east coast are building apartment complexes on the vacant mall and retail locations if they're not already sold to shipping/logistics operations.  That stop-gap is at least 12-18 months from helping the situation, however."

i mean there's a history you can just go back and check. why would it be you"
2021-06-17 17:42:01,stocks,it's been trading sideways since mid 2020
2021-06-17 16:28:25,stocks,"Since March of 2020 until November or December 2020, the stock went on a massive run. It's sideways now but it's not surprising considering how fast it went up. It'll still continue to grow but not at a pace you might be expecting."
2021-06-17 16:23:53,stocks,"It's based on fundamentals..  apple is trading at pe and price / fcf both over 30...that's overvalued even for an amazing company like apple...there's no fundamental reason for this stock price to go up unless their earnings keep knocking it out of the park and the valuation shrinks to match the business...so trading sideways is expected for a bit until it starts reaching a more fair value


As for FB with the negative news and sell off, it was as low as 250 in January which put it at a forward PE of like 15 or something insane for such a cash flow machine so it inevitably ran up

Valuations still matter despite what some people here may say, and is perfectly evidenced in this example as the stock with negative news still had a big run up and the one without it didn't, purely due to valuation"

2021-06-17 09:27:23,stocks,"Nope not worried. I invested in NVDA because of how good their GPUs are and how everyone wants them, even if crypto demand drops off, there is still huge demand for their products in general. I also don't think demand will drop off that much."
2021-06-17 09:29:08,stocks,"Less concerned about NVDA.  Their business is more diversified than GPU's right now.  The patent holds are just icing on the cake.

Slightly concerned about the impact on AMD.  Apple was a huge GPU customer and it is becoming clear that eGPU or dGPU from AMD will not be supported with M1/M1X.  They'll be fine, especially with their CPUs."

I can totally see Shell being a big green energy player in 2050 for example. Similar to what Ford is doing with EV now.

2021-06-17 12:01:57,stocks,"What? This is super obvious. not only tech, most non essentials will tank super hard due to extreme inflation especially from that families spending and tax credits plan. US does not have a robust manufacturing industry so it’s going to tank majority of stocks. Coupled with tax hike there is no way US corps can scale up local supply chain to meet all the artificial demand without insane artificial wage hikes, most goods will have to be purchased overseas. Big winner will be those coins though."
2021-06-17 13:59:43,stocks,I mean that’s a big discussion but I was mainly trying to get an answer to my original question. Is Apple very undervalued?
2021-06-17 11:01:02,stocks,"Yeah that's a good lesson. Part of my learning during the dips of the past few months was that I bought every dip early on, including new stocks... only to see the dip continue. Then I was out of cash to buy more into my best picks when things were truly way down. I saw someone say the other day the dips you should buy are when they are 5-10% down.

Also I am a little traumatized from the Feb ATH, but I read somewhere that sometimes it's also good to buy a stock on the rise too... But I got burned doing that a few times in Feb. But I saw that to be true. There are several stocks I DIDN'T buy in the past few months because they were at ATH and I was worried they'd just dip after I bought them. but they just kept on going up! So long story short: stick with my convictions on a stock for the long term, don't focus so much on the chart or emotions on what may happen."
2021-06-17 11:46:59,stocks,"Eh, it's pretty volatile.  I wouldn't be surprised to see it in the 80s again if the market pulls back.  I'll buy again at 92, 85 and heavily if it hits 80.

PLTR; highly speculative big data play.

SNOW; cloud database play, richly valued but could go up further if it can maintain its growth.

NKE: king of sportswear. Will continue to post killer profits. Huge brand loyalty. Market cap allows for doubling over time.

COIN: If you think decentralised currency is here to stay, this one's a good bet. Check out their balance sheet, they make a lot of profit. But only if (byte)/8 coin doesn't crash back to 5k or something.


LMND: millennials like their insurance. If they can keep up growth, they might eventually be a successful company. Right now they're losing money though. 


AMD: they're making chips that are better than Intel's and competitive with nvda. Production is only issue. But, assuming chip shortage is resolved over time, and their chips stay ahead of intel, this one has a lot of room to grow its market cap. It's still half of intel."
2021-06-17 08:04:37,stocks,"ORCL, SAP Oracle's cloud platform is quite successfull and its revenues are growing fast. SAP is finally transferring their software into the cloud and it is good and profitable software too. Both are cheap.

HPE their private cloud solutions (containerized too, i.e. Docker) are loved by companies that want cloud but cannot move to public cloud, i.e. legal, medical, financial companies. They also own Cray company which makes supercomputers. They been selling well. HPE is still quite reasonably priced.

INTC US gov will do all it takes to make sure that US produces the best chips on its soil. Its not a joke but matter of national security. Subsidies, incentives, espionage, banning competitors nothing is off the table. Intel is dirt cheap.

Some other tech sleepers but its already too late ROP, BSY, EQIX, MRVL and others. Wont bother as those are too expensive now."

Why did it run up so much in a year?"
2021-06-17 12:49:31,stocks,"Depends.  The NBV is $16.82.  The stock price of an mREIT is highly correlated to its book value.  Therefore, there is very little upside in terms of stock price, and it isn't a good sign that their book value declined last quarter.  Then there is the specter of a shelf registration hanging over it.  If the stocks drops meaningfully(10-15%) from this point, I would think about going back in.  If you add at this point, you are basically in it for the dividend yield."
2021-06-17 14:09:43,stocks,Could be. It’s not a sure bet but in a sector that has massive potential to grow I like it.

Then the reconstitution of Russell and a lot of ETFs chose June to rebalance.  A lot going on that I am not going to pretend Im smart enough to time.  I did LEAP short the SP500 though.  We will have at least one major correction this year.

2021-06-17 10:34:27,stocks,"You're basically me.  I bought at 44, then 35, then 31 over the past few month.  I sold most of my holdings around 40 but kept a bit in case it went crazy.  I'll add more around 30 because the P/E is super attractive at that price.

Just gotta understand that it could take 2-5 years and there's a strong possibility it trades flat for at least 12 months."
2021-06-17 10:35:02,stocks,"The fed in theory is immune to political pressures.

Whether you believe that or not is up to you.

I think Powell and the fed generally act independent and will not give in to political pressures.

That said, believing the fed raising rates will tank the economy is laughable."
2021-06-17 10:29:10,stocks,"Politics aside, I think the FED has backed themselves into a corner. Either kill the economy reopening or kill the stock market. Rock and a hard place for sure. No easy calls. Hence the volatility right now."
2021-06-17 10:26:45,stocks,True but I think the jobs numbers this morning gave everyone confirmation that it isn't going to happen in the immediate future. Everyone is trying to catch some growth before the hike. I mean you have to stay ahead of that transitory inflation lol.
2021-06-17 10:31:58,stocks,"Yes.

If inflation stays high they'll have no choice but to raise rates sooner than 2024.

Most likely 2023, possibly even 2022."
2021-06-17 10:28:28,stocks,"Well they’re also estimating some aggressive inflation 

Conceptually if inflation doesn’t keep rising beyond their rising expectations then what they’ve said is what we have"

2021-06-17 15:52:25,stocks,I caved and started a position at 327.  I saw some strong upward afternoon volume.  Only about a 25 percent position so I can load up if it does drop down to my 310 target.
2021-06-17 14:18:42,stocks,"Need to factor in a few things: how long you have held the stock, potential profits/gains, actual ROI after taxes, why you purchased to begin with, would you invest in it again right now, how many shares you hold, are you willing to part with some shares or do you want to close the position...

If bought under $40 in March 2020, I'd likely take some profits and at least sell to recoup initial investment plus some.

If you only invested because of COVID19, it is time to figure out when to bail entirely.  They'll continue to make money because of COVID vaccines, especially with variants, but that is likely a 2-3 year max return for true growth.

Personally think there is a lot of upside now that they've basically mainstreamed their mRNA platform.  There are many products in their pipeline, heavy on cancer treatments (including prevention and possible cures).  They've proven the technology is safe and deployable.  Even something like orhan drug style status should be achievable for targeted therapy on rare diseases.  Bright future if they can land any of the products in their pipeline or even push to Phase 2 trials.  They'll find partners with pockets (like they did with Pfizer) for something if it is even remotely promising."
2021-06-17 17:06:16,stocks,I bought earlier this year coming out of the mini dip before that month long correction. Thought I was a god. Then pain.
2021-06-17 16:33:28,stocks,Dec 2021.  I didnt pay attention to the particular day.
2021-06-17 17:12:25,stocks,"I mean in the present day yeah but since you mentioned you're holding for the long term, it doesn't matter what it is today as much. In another decade, you'll probably see that the stock has grown well since you first bought it.

AAPL is like a buy and forget it type of stock because it'll be fine. Maybe in the future, you'll see how much you've gained from it and take your profits to put it on a stock that might grow quicker or just leave it there and let it continue doing its thing. 

But if you're at a loss right now and you're thinking of pulling out, I would personally wait to get back to even or a slight gain before you take it out."
2021-06-17 18:31:12,stocks,"So to be clear your definition of undervalued is comparing one company to others?  If you're saying apple is undervalued relative to other big tech stocks you could have some truth to what you're saying...if you're saying apple is undervalued as a stock overall you have 0 basis for that statement, at least based on the above.   Apple never traded at a PE of 29+ pre covid consistently"
2021-06-17 12:40:11,stocks,A stock that goes up can also came from manipulation.

2021-06-17 10:37:45,stocks,"Which ones? Regional?

Wfc has a high pe right now because of their massive earnings decline in 2020, that will normalize when it falls off the calculation.

I'd guess the banks you are looking at are in a similar boat."

2021-06-17 10:15:33,stocks,"There is a lot at play. TSMC is using ASML equipment which is EU company. China wants Taiwan back. American doesnt want the best chips to be made right on China's border. TSMC is building new fab in US. Intel got rid of of Bob Swan and the new guy is really good. US gov and EU gov is literally pouring money into Intel. Made in America drive from Biden. AMD vs Intel vs Nvidia. nm vs 3d stacking. There is so much going in that I don't pretend to know it all or understand it all. However, at undemanding 10x p/e, positive cashflow, solid dividend it looks to me like risk/reward is in your favour. I think its worth a shot at this price, you might be pleasantly surprised in few years time."
2021-06-17 10:42:51,stocks,This is great.
2021-06-17 11:19:10,stocks,"Not the person you’re responding to, but I personally think so. Right now they’re sitting on huge reserves of undeployed capital, hesitant to lend because of uncertainty with rate changes. They would stand to massively gain from a rate increase, but since that isn’t happening near-term, they’re effectively business-as-usual and not positioned for large revenue gains until it does. In my opinion."
2021-06-17 10:57:43,stocks,"My question still stands though. What changed fundamentaly to cause it to double during covid?

I honestly have no idea. They may be worth it, but this runup is huge."
2021-06-17 13:01:16,stocks,"I think NRZ has more upside.  They added mortgage origination to their business and they bought Caiber for mortgage servicing.  There are a lot of moving parts, so this is probably a more of a long term hold.  If there is any pullback closer to 10, I would start adding.  They are trading under their BV, good yield, and the market isn't really pricing in the new moves they made.


Another idea might be Apartment REITs, which are back to pre-pandemic price.  They are fairly valued, but it would be a good income stock with low volatility.  Might be some upside with rent hikes and increase in occupancy rates."

2021-06-17 11:35:21,stocks,"Nothing to feel bad about, people were buying at 40 because they thought it would keep going up.  No one says, 'I feel bad for the person who sold me that at 40 now that it's 60'.  There's always a risk of the trade going against you on either side!"

Do you think it’s building energy to go upwards again?"
2021-06-17 10:33:47,stocks,"It's your money, but I would say to look at Q1 as a prelude. Intel is due to shrink for awhile and has a broken culture; the money is secondary and they're still going to be outgunned by TSMC and Samsubg either way there.

I will say that the recent geopolitical changes are very good for Global Foundries if and when they IPO since they're already an approved provider for DoD and have good SoI and photonics tech that kind of money could help them develop more (also a shelved 7nm process that in theory could be revived)."

**Ebix cash is a financial services company that  pioneered the idea of digital cash to the Indian consumer, handling $18 billion in tramsactions a year and generating $232,552,000 In revenue last quarter.**

 * They combine over 300,000 physical distribution outlets with their digital backend, making them India's largest end-to-end financial exchange today, conducting in excess of $18 Billion in gross merchandise value.

 * They offer prepaid cards and money transfers. Remittences alone account for 2.9% of India's total GDP with immigrants sending money back home to their relatives,[and it doesn't help indians have the highest median household income of any ethnic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income#Asian_Americans). Their remittences business handles $6.5 billion in tramsactions a year, 70% of India's remittences business.

 * 32 banks use their technology, asset, and wealth management making them leaders in India, The Philippines, Marutius and other regions.

* Their travel portfolio is one of Southeast Asia's largest with over 200,000 agents, 25 branches, and 10,000 corporate clients. This let's customers book flights, busses, cabs and hotels all online.

*Lastly they offer a service that lets people see a doctor online, 24/7.  


**EBIX SaaS**

* Ebix powers multiple exchanges across the world in the field of life,health and property & casualty insurance while conducting in excess of $100 billion in insurance premiums annually on its platforms. [They do so much with the insurance industry I can't reasonably explain everything there](https://www.ebix.com/company). 

 * They make CRM software, claims processing, enterprise software, research and quoting, loss and risk analysis. I'm not going to comment on this is much because it's a much smaller part of their business, and frankly don't know enough about health insurance to comment on this as much as their financial services. I'd rather look like I'm an idiot than a bullshitter.

I honestly don't get why they are shorted so much, according to their financial results, their operating income did decline 9% yoy and yoy gaap income decreased 13% yoy, however that was due to the pandemic, and does not reflect their core fundamentals. Excluding revenues from the foreign exchange, travel, e-learning and remittance businesses that were impacted the most by COVID-19, Q1 2021 revenues grew 187% as compared to Q1 2020.They have over $130 million in cash which is almost enough to cover *all* of their $139 million SG&A expenses last year.

I've been wanting to contribute to my Roth IRA, especially now that I'm at an employer that doesn't do a 401k match. However, I don't have enough disposable income to do regular standalone contributions. 

Then it occurred to me that I have some dividend paying holdings in a brokerage I leave untouched. These are long long term holds that I bought some time ago and are up a decent amount in percentage gains (example PFE and BAC bought back around 2012 or so). I'm a bit tired of doing the dividend tax filing for these each year, not hard, just one more thing I have to make sure I include. 

Since I don't plan on purposefully selling these unless I need emergency funds, and since I can't directly transfer the shares to my IRA, should I consider selling some of these holdings and repurchasing in my IRA to continue building my retirement nest egg more efficiently?

I'll of course take a tax hit from the capital gains but perhaps the IRA contribution would help offset that? Does the long term benefit of not having to pay taxes on the dividends offset the upfront tax cost?"

However, a lot can change in a year, especially for business owners. If I were you, I would wait until April of 2022 (deadline for 2021 contributions) to liquidate. In the meantime, I would see if you could save up enough to contribute and not sell."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"How do you silence that voice that says ""wait, stop""? Serious trading psychology question for anyone who is experienced enough to answer. I've been analyzing charts, learning the ropes, and practicing my stocks and options scalping strategies daily whenever I find enough time to. Heading into every trading day, I feel adequately prepared to place a few trades in the market.

However, when the time comes to actually place the trade, I hesitate, and for that brief moment, my fear of loss stops me from clicking on the ""buy"" button. The chart is a perfect setup, I'm almost certain of exactly what's coming, and seconds later, I see the price move in the exact direction I wanted, but because of that split second moment of fear that I'll lose money, I didn't get into the trade and missed my opportunity  for gains.

This has happened multiple times already (including THREE times today within the first fifteen minutes), and I've missed out on sizeable gains because of it. Worse, of the two times this week that I managed to actually conquer this fear and get into the trades, they've gone the other way on me  within seconds, so I DID end up realizing a small loss on each (which now makes this fear even worse).

I know the easy solution is to just ""get over it,"" but that's easier said than done when my FOBB (fear of being burned) supersedes my FOMO tenfold. Do you have any tips that can help?"
2021-06-17 01:01:19,stocks,You have to make a trading plan and stick to it regardless of your emotions. Humans are loss averse (we hate losing almost twice as much as we enjoy a gain) so what you’re feeling is totally normal. No trading strategy works 100% of the time so managing risk and getting more wins than losses is the name of the game. If it was easy everyone would trade for a living.
2021-06-17 00:59:15,stocks,"You're not losing anything you don't have, and what you do have, you haven't loss until you sell. 

I just did the same thing as you, did some research over the weekend, found a couple companies I really liked, got up early last week and the price took off 10%-20% that day (guess everyone saw the same opportunity). I waited out the early day swings and it never came back to the initial price - in fact it gained another 10% that week. I tapped out and moved on. 

I sat on it too long but didn't get caught up in the bidding up either. This week they have loss probably half those gains. If I bought peak I would be regretting my loss instead. It's easy to think what if, but you and I didn't. There are probably millions of people thinking what if I bought amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc years ago, look how much I would be up. But you can't know then what you know now. Hope this helps, it's only human - play long, I find it helps."
2021-06-17 01:04:04,stocks,"I'll preface with that I don't day trade; and swing only sometimes. My portfolio is a consistent 30% in stable funds that pay dividends, and the rest spread out across regular trades. Having that 30% there as a backup to add to or take from is great.

I'm also in stocks for the long haul overall. I tricked my mind early on to believe that once I deposit money, it's ""no longer mine"" in the sense that it stays there. I'm just over 2 years in and I haven't made a single withdrawal yet. I coupled that mentality with the ""Don't invest with more than what you're willing to lose"" adage.

I also love that Buffett quote that goes along the lines of ""If you can't handle your holdings losing 50% without becoming grief-stricken, you don't belong in the stock market"""

2021-06-17 01:06:06,stocks,Are you trading with a stop loss? The way that you are attempting to trade and not technique requires you to also be putting your trades in with a stop loss or percentage trailing stop loss. The way that you determine what your stop-loss should be under the price that you buy in at is that you look at the ATR or the average true range can you subtract that number from the price that you buy in and that's what you set your stop loss to. Now if you want to have a trailing stop loss you might want to look into that a little bit more deeply and try it out as practice in the end if you're feeling that way right at the moment of the by then you just need more practice and you need to keep doing it over a series of times to get more comfortable and it really sounds like you aren't using the stop-loss technique correctly if your scalping. I can't imagine any scalpers that don't use stop-loss
2021-06-17 01:33:25,stocks,"Making an assumption here: You learnt whatever you needed to and then jumped to trading live with a real money and are struggling with the psychology of the actual trading. If my assumption is right, then this is perfectly normal. The best way to overcome this is to practice on simulator with virtual money. You will build the reflexes and psychology to enter and exit trades and at the same time get a lot of screen time. Make all the mistakes you want and eliminate the FOBB. I’ve been through this and many people I know spent months in sim perfecting their strategies before going live. 

Once you’re comfortable in sim, switch over to live trading. Remember, you can’t become a good swimmer just by reading books and watching YouTube videos. You have to get into the shallow end first, get used to the water before you head to the deep end. It takes time

You need to get your mind right. You could've easily ""missed out"" on ""sizeable losses"" due to your hesitation too. In that case you'd probably be thanking yourself. In actuality, both are bad, because you show you are incapable of being consistent in your wins or your losses, and therefore won't have a baseline to judge whether you are right or wrong in the future.

You can sit me in front of a simulator right now and watch me pull off five trades in five minutes without any hesitation whatsoever, but the second it's actual live trading with real money, that fear resurfaces and holds me back 😓

When I started, I only risked $20. If the trade went against me, the max I would lose is $20. I use DAS Trader and it automatically calculate position size and create a stop loss on the click of a button. I used ToS, not ideal for scalping at all, but if it works for you, then great."
2021-06-17 01:58:30,stocks,"Just to clarify, when I say I only risk $20 per trade, my total investment will be a lot higher depending on how many shares I am allowed to buy. I only lose $20 when the trade doesn’t go my way. That’s how position sizing works

With scalps, the hold time isn't long: enter when the price is showing signs of trending in your favor, hold through the quick move (which could range from minutes to even seconds), and get out before the security's price has a chance to turn without worrying about how long the price continues to move in the same direction. In my limited experience, I always get out and take small gains when the momentum starts slowing; whatever happens to the price afterward is not my concern.

2. Stick to long term investing if that’s easier on your nerves


I know you want option 1

Day trading will involve winning and losing trades. With experience you will learn how to keep the winning side higher. You need to adjust your mindset and expect to incur losses. Maybe your trade plan could mention that you are okay with e.g. 20% of your trades being losers and you’ll stop for the day when you hit it.

>“Meme stocks,” which often start as low-priced, highly shorted stocks that users of online forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets rally behind, are some of the most heavily traded and volatile shares on any given day.

>Shares of companies like video game retailer GameStop Corp (GME.N) and theater chain operator AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) have whipsawed this year, with GameStop having rallied more than 1,600% in January alone, prompting trading halts by some brokers and sparking Congressional and regulatory hearings.

>""In some of the meme stocks that we've seen, or stocks that have a high level of retail participation, the vast majority of order flow can trade off of exchanges, which is problematic,"" said Stacey Cunningham, president of Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (ICE.N) NYSE.

>""That price formation is not really reflective of what supply and demand is,"" she said at a conference hosted by CNBC.

>Retail trading surged during the coronavirus pandemic, helped by a shift by retail brokerages to commission-free trading, with individual traders now responsible for around 35% of market volume, up from 20% pre-pandemic.

>In meme stocks, individual traders contribute as much as 70% of the volume, Cunningham said.

>The majority of retail orders bypass exchanges because of an arrangement called payment for order flow, in which retail brokerages sell their customers' marketable orders to wholesale brokers. The wholesalers match the orders internally, trying to profit off of the bid-ask spread, while offering retail traders the best market price or better.

>Retail brokers say payment for order flow lowers overall costs for individual traders.

2021-06-17 14:50:51,stocks,"You want every dark pool and hedge fund to get an MM permit and join in providing PFOF

The more of them are required to keep up 3-5k shares in quotes from open to close, the narrower the spread to you. And the harder they compete in the middle, the better your price-improvement and the lower your risk of getting a fill three quotes deep in the book."
2021-06-17 14:17:38,stocks,"MMs make perfect sense. They quote both sides and allow retail buyers and other traders to decide which side to fill, or to improve.

MMs are required to keep reasonably sized orders on the book the entire time the market is open.

That means you will always be able to trade, unless the market mechanism (including the broker, MM, or clearinghouse) breaks down because of an excessively large change in the order flow.

If the MM is posting irrational quotes it will quickly find itself with a large imbalanced position in the ticker, which creates a large risk that they can't lay off that position and will take a big loss that wipes out their spread profits.

Citadel's PFOF improves the price to you at the expense of their own MM quote.

If your broker doesn't take the fee from a PFOF provider, you get the quote price, which is worse for you.

A hedge fund has to deal with the market just like you do, but like any large trader also has access to traders who don't want to have to deal with fiddling small change or risk distorting the book. Those traders would rather do the legwork of finding a large counterparty to transact a block trade at a negotiated price.

While they're doing that the market price could easily move against them (either side), and the negotiations could be affected by it, so it their risk is similar to yours.

If the whales have to splash the tape, volatility will go sky-high, and you won't be able to even hope that your market order will be filled within 100% of the price you just saw quoted."

On top of that why would i short the stock when they can use dark pools to pump it even higher ? That would go against what i just said.

Luckily for you, i actually did short GME and AMC around the same time, i shorted GME stock when it hit 300$, price action was kinda pathetic while everyone is convinced its shorts queezing and new high(it wasn't, the high is 483$), it barely had legs to go up.

Shorted a little AMC about the same week as well.

Went pretty decently though GME had me worried for a bit there.

To actually short the stocks one would have to know when and why, otherwise this is not our first market mania, not at all, markets can be irrational longer than one can stay solvent.

Heck irrationality can go on for years, nobody is willing to pay the premiums for a year or hold money sidelines for margin calls.

If i notice something good, i am going to be right there, buying or shorting, whichever way wind blows

Do you know how many things started one way and go another? Most things…. You don’t consider historic context. Who was trading when “dark pools” or block trading like every non over 12 year old would call it? Only institutional investors why? No internet no interest no infrastructure.

Even on days people are making fun of ""volume for ants"" for GME and AMC, these are highly liquid stocks being traded in very high volumes in the lit pools. Also the common (uninformed) sentiment is to claim that the short ladder attacks are dropping the price via dark pool trading, which doesn't make any sense, since as you mentioned dark pool trades are cloaked and don't result in broad market price discovery.

However I could agree that dark pools may be a problem for the less liquid/lower volume meme stocks, that might definitely be true."

Good traders know it's a hustle and they factor that in. People who think it's a legitimate market don't in my experience tend to do very well.

And being made *aware* of that fact, that the free market isn't free at all, has made meme stocks what they are. People are furious at the open and blatant bullshit.

The markets won't clog up if buyers capable of buying these millions of shares are also in this market.

Shorted a little AMC about the same week as well.

On XOM, size is king. Oil is going to have a fantastic year or two, and they're much better positioned to take advantage of it. They need to get drilling back to full speed, but they should easily get back to profit this year. Plenty of upside on the underlying, and pay a generous dividend in the meantime.

The startup, which is profitable, is working with an adviser to solicit interest from investors, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The idea is to find backers who can help it become more of a mainstream media platform and lessen its reputation for porn.

Though OnlyFans has roots in adult entertainment, the site wants to be a place where a broad range of celebrities and athletes can connect with fans. It’s also looking to attract more advertisers, some of which may be wary of its porn ties.

So far, its celebrity users include professional boxer Floyd Mayweather and rapper Cardi B. Companies such as Sticky’s Finger Joint, a restaurant chain specializing in chicken fingers, have joined OnlyFans as part of their marketing strategies.

OnlyFans handled more than US$2 billion in sales last year. Since the site takes a 20 per cent fee, that means it had over US$400 million in revenue.

This year, the London-based company is growing at a rate of over 100 per cent, according to the person familiar with the situation. OnlyFans has said it’s paid out over US$3 billion to the more than 1.25 million creators on its platform. It has over 130 million registered users.

2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"A note to young investors (or new investors) As the Fed caused a bit of a ripple in the market today and I considered vacating a position (but ultimately didn't).  I thought a little bit about my journey over the years and thought I'd share a story and a few things I've learned.

Back in 2003, I made my first move in the stock market by taking an $1800 tax return and buying 200 shares of a coal company called Consol.  At the time it traded under the symbol CNX.  I bought it with almost no DD simply because it paid a pretty good dividend.  (Around .50/share if I recall correctly.)  This is back when internet trading really wasn't a thing.  I bought it through my bank and the trade cost me **$40**!  (I actually had to call a broker at my bank and place the trade over the phone.  Ancient times, right?)  lol  I figured, win lose or draw, eventually this stock will pay for itself with the dividend.  I didn't follow the market much after that because I was really holding for the dividend, but realized a couple of years later, it had climbed into the 30s.  Around 2007 it had hit 55 and I decided to sell.  Still with my bank, the trade cost me another forty bucks!  I took the money and put it in a basic savings account where it basically sat doing nothing until 2016.  (I missed the crash of 08, by being liquid at the time, but this was pure luck.  Nobody saw that coming.)

In 2016, after some reading I decided I had more confidence in trading so I took the money and opened an investor's checking/trading account with Charles Schwab.  *I was amazed at trades costing $4.99 and done on my laptop*!  lol  After quite a bit of DD I decided to buy 300 shares of NVIDIA.  At around $24 a share, it cost me about $7200.  (I took the rest and made a down payment on a new (*used*) car and an AK-47.)  lol...

After that, I just held the stock.  Diamond handed it as the kids say.  I've bought and sold quite a few other stocks over the years, but those two trades are where I started.  Two trades over the course of 17 years turned an $1800 tax return into a nice safety net worth over $200,000 with almost no effort on my part.

What have I learned?

Even a small amount of money in the stock market can lead to a big return.  But don't invest more than you can afford.  For me, a tax return one year was about all I could throw at it in my 20s.  ""YOLOing"" your rent check is never a good idea.

Be PATIENT.  You're not going to get rich overnight.  That type of thing is rare and risky.  Do your DD and hold onto what you're confident in.

When the market takes a downturn, **BUY!**  One of my biggest regrets is not investing heavily in 2008 when I was very liquid and the market had taken a nose dive.  I did not repeat this mistake last April/May when the pandemic caused another crash.  I bought everything I could.  Particularly old giants like Ford, and GE which were no brainer bargains at >$5.  The worst thing you can do is panic sell.  The market will come back.  Hold on and accumulate.  (I actually figured it might take 2 years for a comeback this time, but we bounced back much earlier.)  This thinking is what got me to hold the position I was thinking of bailing on today, when I realized I would just be panic selling in advance of some Fed news.  Regardless of the news, the market would bounce back.

Never let savings sit in a traditional savings account. (*like I did for 8 years from 2007-2016...lol)*  Even if compound interest is all you're after, there are much better rates with other financial products.

Be patient, *but don't be afraid to take profits*.  Don't fall in love.  Have an exit plan.  I sold Consol around 55 with a 9 entry.  Pretty good...  Later that same year, it climbed into the 90s.  Made me wince, but I didn't regret it.  *Unless you have a crystal ball, you're never going to enter at a historic low and exit at an all time high and that's ok.*  I realized at the time that coal was cyclical and was most likely going to decline in value in the coming years.  I stuck to the plan.  When I saw a spike, I sold.  For perspective, that high in the 90s in 08 hasn't been repeated since.  Consol trades in the high teens now and offers no dividend. (New ticker CEIX)  So in hindight I exited on a bubble that could have been better, but if I waited too long, it could have been much worse.

It's never too late to start.  If you look at those two simple trades over the span of 17 years, you could potentially do the same thing in your late 40s with a small amount of money (*remember nothing you can't afford to lose)* and have a decent nest egg by the time you hit 100% retirement in your 60s.

I hope to have given a little insight here.  I thought it was worth sharing.  If you disagree, don't be too hard on me.  I'm not a financial professional...  :D

I think this is the most important nugget: It's better to exit and see things get better (i.e., missing out on additional gains) then hold and see a net loss.

Only other thing I'd add is that it's also okay to accept a small loss or dump stagnant stock if there are better opportunities for your cash.  I see a lot of people proud to hold stock for years so that they can sell without a ""loss"", but they'd have made more accepting the loss early on with a sell and re-investing in a better stock."

2021-06-16 21:14:18,stocks,"Also a warning to young investors: if you invested $1800 into 200 shares of CNX at $9 in 2003, you would only have 200 shares of CNX and 25 shares of CEIX after the 2017 spinoff, giving you:

200 x 14.53 = $2,906

Plus 25 x 18.66 = $466.50

Total value after 18 years = $3,372.50.

Almost doubling your money sounds great, but if you invested $1,800 into SPY in 2003, you'd have around $10,000.

So HODLing a crap stock forever doesn't always pan out.  Not even close."
2021-06-16 20:39:44,stocks,Thanks for sharing. Just for clarification does DD mean due diligence?
2021-06-16 20:37:08,stocks,"Thanks for sharing your story.  Time in there market is better than timing the market? 
Do you believe in individual stock picking over an index fund for the long term?"
2021-06-16 21:22:50,stocks,"Great story, and the key in all this, is:

> Do your DD and hold onto what you're confident in.

The reason you were able to buy Consol at $9 and sell at $55, and Nvidia at $24, and hold until now, was because you picked stocks that were reasonably priced & had great up side potential. Now, with Consol, you probably just got lucky since the stock has since crashed from its high. But even still, you did not buy at $90 and then sit on your butt hoping for the day it goes to $180. That would've been a futile dream and you'd be down over 80% on your money today.

Many people on Reddit don't realize this. Or they do realize it but cannot get over the other advice - which you yourself gave - that ""time in the market is better than timing the market."" The problem being, while that is *generally* the case, it is *not* the case if you buy at market highs on fundamentally bad stocks, funds, or sectors. As your own story illustrated, Consol never returned to $90. Or even the $55 you sold it at. This isn't necessarily because it was a bad company when you bought it, but is rather because the sector it's in - coal - has since crashed over environmental concerns.
 
So without due diligence, and without paying attention to the market, I'd argue that the market isn't nearly as forgiving as the old saying goes. You could well buy high into a stock that *never* recovers or goes bankrupt, taking your money with it.

Consequently, I think to your advice, I'd add the following - ""time in the index is better than timing the index"" and ""only buy individual stocks if you are willing to not only do due diligence, but manage your positions over the long-term."" Because company and industry fortunes can change, as shown by the collapse of, for example, video renting retail stores and the coal industry. With actual stocks, you *can't* just assume ""it'll come back.""

If you're a buy and forget type of person, buy the index and hold it until you need it. There's better and worse times to enter the market, to be sure, so always keep cash on hand, but you're better off investing now than grow old waiting for the market to crash."

2021-06-17 09:45:42,stocks,"I have you beat on NVDA.  I bought it a decade ago at around $12 a share.  But I sold it all last year when it hit $300.  I thought for sure it would go back down to at least $150 and I could buy back in.  $300 just seemed crazy. I'm kicking myself now for selling, I could never imagine it hitting $700.  It just proves you can't time the market.   
I did do some DD and bought discover and target with my nvda profits, and both have doubled or tripled since.  Both of them had good fundamentals and seemed cheap.  
The market today seems crazy.  Some companies are trading at fair values while others are very expensive.  TSLA for example.  I can't buy stock that trading with a pe of 600. 

I also used to buy stock in the late 90s and early 2000s with a phone call.  The worst part of that was I always had brokers calling me at all hours of the day trying to talk me into more purchases.  

Or how about the phone tip lines?  I remember being in high school and my boss at my part time job making me call into a tip line and take notes each day lol"
2021-06-17 10:11:06,stocks,"I dunno man, the reverse repo markets got me spooked.  There are lots of signs of a big crash coming.  Just gotta know where to look.  I feel it in my bones.  The same thing that happened in 2008 with MBS’s and CDO’s is taking place now except this time it’s with CMBS’s and Bespoke Tranche Opportunities.  Banks got super over leveraged due to covid SLR which expired at the end of March.  As soon as that expired the repo market went nuts, it’s breaking records everyday.  Usually you only see heavy use of the repo market during the end of a quarter as financial institutions rebalance their portfolios.  But it’s already at half a trillion dollars a day, what’s it going to look like at the end of this quarter?  You also see the DTC passing new regulations and clarifications on already existing rules like crazy.  And most of these new rules are how to deal with liquidation of large financial institutions.  They’re planning for large scale domino bankruptcy.  I hope I’m wrong."

You could have picked up 300 shares of Intel back then at $34 and only be up sub-20%. Yes, stocks can provide astronomical returns if you happen to pick a unicorn. But, they could also lose money too. Your advice is to basically go all-in on basic DD when it would have been way less risky to buy QQQ or SPY in the non-taxable account.

What if NVDA crashed and burned? This post would be a cautionary tale lol....just buy ETFs."

Stopped contributing to retirement accounts in fear when I should have been pouring everything I had minus my emergency fund of 3 months. I would also suggest consuming financial media from multiple sources and mediums. Don't necessarily follow all their advice, but learn what you can from them and form your own opinions. Eventually you'll find an investing style you're most comfortable with. Good luck everybody! And buying a car and gun is very Merica! Love it."

2021-06-17 12:42:20,stocks,"Nice post but i would like to add (you already kinda said it with „nothing you cant afford“..) that this kinda tactic only works if you are rich or if you actually CAN leave your money there, essentially „forget“ your money there without worrying each second what will happen. 

If you are poor, these 1000bucks are ridiculously important.

Next year i have to pay back 10k € (student loan). I have around 6k atm. Iam trying to invest smartly, i unfortunately dont work anymore, and iam trying to reach 10k so i can get out of Uni without a debt. But also, i will have 0 bucks in my bank account.

Wtf should i do ? I see ppl gaining with options, ofcourse losing ones aswell. 

Iam currently thinking to take all 6 and invest in a good options call, 1-2-3% would equal around 20-30%. But this Fed thing yesterday and the general concern (inflation) makes me really worried.

And cause all of this is not enough, my father told me that they are not working 40h weeks anymore but 35. which has a huge effect on us. I kinda have the pressure to do something. Ohh man..... iam tired honestly. And then i see ppl yoloing 2million. They have lost the feeling for money, they dont seem to understand how much it is."

The kids these days live in the age of prime, shoot 2 day deliver they even have instant in select places. Streaming is the new, so no more waiting everything is on demand. Hence when it comes to money the same sentiment. They dont want to hold for like 10 years and collect they want to do what the big players are doing buying and selling in the same day to make 20k.

2021-06-16 23:18:42,stocks,"The market is not a get rich quick scheme.  If you treat it as such, you’ll be treated like a casino patron.  

My father’s timeless advice: the longer you stay in a casino, the more likely you are to lose.  The longer you stay in the stock market, the more likely you are you win.

Forget the stock picking.  Half of all mutual funds fail to beat the S&P 500.  To repeat, most people that have this as a day job can’t beat a boring index.

Think in decades, give up on DFV level expectations of returns, and you are guaranteed to retire rich.  Or... you can put it all on Red (AMC, GME, Bitcoin, whatever) and prepare to get comped a room, a buffet, and a realization of your inner most self.

This is turtle v hare.  Don’t be the hare."

I think if RC does what he did with Chewy, he could easily make Gamestop a big company again and while I know its extremely controversial, I generally see it as a good long term play.

After doing some research and watching some videos and reading the rare comments like these, i decided to drop all i had and start fresh, invest into stable dividend companies and well known, strong companies that are very stable and safe and just wait it out. now that's my plan from now on, i dont have the knowledge to gamble with meme stocks, i still don't know if im even doing it right but i think a long haul approach is better and safer.

Very true story I’m hanging on to one now of course after I buy it dropped even more way more day after day slowing dropping 3/4 less then 2 weeks ago I’m say oh my lord bad timing on my part but like you say we don’t have a Crystal ball right.
But hanging on to a share you know will bounce back in a matter of time walk away stopping watching it is my way of moving on to something else that could 🚀 100% or 1000% but if you don’t take as gamble you make peanuts money sitting in a bank account doing absolutely nothing.

Just wanted to say loved that story thanks for sharing 🚀👍📰🆙🚀💰"

2021-06-17 14:45:08,stocks,"Horrible advice to buy one stock. Even if you don't buy an index fund you should split your investment between ~20-30 companies preferably in different sectors of the economy that respond differently to different cycles.

Index fund has historically outperformed people that do it for a living(with their high fees) like 98%. Just buy an index fund.

If you want to have a hobby and or think you have some kind of magic bullet system, sign up for one of those fake accounts where they give you fake money to play with. I'd say if you can beat the S&P index fund for a year you can start dipping your toes. The longer you beat it the more you can put in."

The downside was when I bought, DIS and TSLA were worth the same... I chose DIS because TSLA seemed too volatile... oh well"

I have the goal of being a millionaire in 4 years to retire, and just swing trade/invest the rest of my life (currently 32 yoa). 

I’m trying to develop a specific plan of options trading: 

Sell weekly cash covered puts on higher bets stocks I’d like to be invest in long term anyway. 

I figure, an hour of research every Sunday, I should be able to nab a conservative 2% per week. 

Not including taxes, 2% weekly returns compounds to something like $1.5M over 4 years. 

I’m trying to try to allocate my puts across 5+ companies so as not to be too exposed to any one company. 

I was 20% up in 6 weeks (went from $20k to $25k), but my last 2 weeks were very ASO heavy, and the sporting goods consumer market took a dump this week. Now I’m only up 10% in 6 weeks lol."

Most people would be better of buying diversified index funds than buying individual stocks."
2021-06-17 19:40:17,stocks,"Excellent read, thank you very much. 

Probably not the place to post this, well maybe. I've been around stocks nearly all my life, watching my parents trade to having a ton of shares in Ford when my grand father passed away, so I'm fairly knowledgeable. I've grown up using etrader and Charles Schwab, well watching my parents play with their portfolios and them trying to set mine up. 

Now I'm  confident enough to start investing my own money, money I've saved for quite some time and I'm building a nice portfolio.
My question is where do most of you OG's invest at?
I've been browsing all the apps, so many different stories of each one. I watched the dumb shit Robinhood did unfold on Twitter. Webull seems great but my God the comment section is toxic. Etrader looks so simplistic yet confusing, figure it would be designed better.
I have my portfolio is places I'm comfortable with but my problem is finding all or any stock that I want to trade in not accessible. Just wanted to hear some insight. Appreciate it."

2021-06-17 19:52:38,stocks,Thank you for sharing. Buying and holding stocks especially in your 20’s will pay very well going into retirement. I was always skeptical of savings accounts. Why would I leave my money in savings accounts when I can earn way more from buying stocks. Gramps always told me to to hold during market downturns. See it as a buying opportunity!

* Assuming you're in it for the long haul and aren't taking money out of the market, holding something that loses less than a bear market loses can be just as much of a win as holding something that makes more than a bull market.  So you should consider it a win."

My 401k is for retirement security, and it therefore stays boring, just shoving more and more money into it over time.  

My Roth IRA is obviously also fire retirement, but for high risk/high reward plays, leveraging the tax advantage of such an account.  It's where I might buy a high growth stock has a higher risk of crashing but also could make boatloads in the long term.

My brokerage account lives somewhere in the middle, with some stock picks, some broad funds, some narrow funds... and I just aim to beat the market by a tiny amount every day.  I won today, beating the market by about 0.4% even though that means it went down in value.  That's the money I'm ""allowed"" to do something stupid with."

They just wanted our percentages so I 20 20 20 20 20ed them and I maxed my amount.  Thinking my car could die and I would lower my contribution when I started up a car payment.

r/superstonk is a sub focused on hedging the incoming financial crisis, by buying gamestop. they propose that the short position was never covered on gamestop, only got shorted more. apparently the fall from $488 to $38 was an artificial attack. ever since january, the price has been steadily uptrending. the current belief is these hedges that hold an infinite short position, are almost out of money, and once they get margin called, its supposed to trigger the biggest short squeeze of all time.

Most TA is pretty obviously sketchy.  Like high RSI values mean it's overbought and you should sell, or it's trending up and you should buy.  Low RSI values mean it's oversold and you should buy, or it's trending down and you should sell.  What do you know, it's always right! :-D  And then they'll say no no, that's too simplistic, you have to go deeper with divergences, crossovers, and other things, which just gives you more ways to interpret things, which means more likely that one interpretation is going to be right!  

Not to mention with the big boys, a good chunk of what you're seeing is market movement unrelated to anything about the company.

2021-06-16 20:11:08,stocks,Resolute also makes paper products. I’m in the industry that supplies them performance chemicals. They will continue to grow based on market demand.
2021-06-17 19:47:37,stocks,"There will likely be another special dividend. Lumber could drop another 25%, and and if it stayed there for a year, it would be the best year in lumber’s history other than 2021. 

RFP issued a special dividend at the end of the year 2018 of 1.5$ a share and the average price of lumber for the year was 450$ mbf. Everyone expects lumber to settle in the 700-900 range for the rest of the year with a likely drop into 500-600 range when building slows/stops for winter. 

The market is ignoring these stocks because they think this is a 2018/2019 scenario where lumber crashed hard and went into a recession fall 2018 and into 2019.  but the underlying industry driving the demand is different now than it was then.  Housing demand dropped end of 2018 and into 2019 so lumber dropped.   there is so much demand for wood products from the housing industry that it’s not going back to those levels for the foreseeable future. All those projects delayed cuz lumber was too higher were delayed, not cancelled. And lumber industry ramping up supply capacity but really only a few percent of total NA capacity. Demand will continue to outpace that growth. 

That’s why RFP’s and WFG’s forward PE is below 3 and there will likely be upward revisions to 2022 revenue projections once we get there."

2021-06-16 20:01:09,stocks,"Used to be a political economist. Some context:

Energy and Gasoline aren't used in inflation indicators because their prices are highly volatile and influenced by cyclical market activity. Also very subject to international cartel negotiations - remember, oil absolutely plummeted last year because of OPEC+ talks stalling and the crash in demand from COVID hitting at the same time. There are also seasonality issues across all energy markets.

Used cars also regularly spike when low income people start being rehired after a recession. Need a car to get to work in the US, so a resurgent in those prices isnt a shock and will stabilize quickly. Oil/energy being by similar amounts suggests that's just a cyclical demand spike. 

The bigger story has been construction materials, but that also appears to be short-term supply disruptions and speculative activity. Lumber prices coming back down to earth, per bloomberg. Which makes sense given the demand spike from people being at home doing projects, and low mortgage rates/shifting population from remote work. 

Basically, this will be a year of hiccups in the data. But  it's not a multi-year concern because of the recession and size of COVID economic displacement. Fed is taking a wait and see approach for that reason."

Ask someone who lived through the 1930s, and they would say: ""Stocks are risky, don't invest."" You won't find many people on reddit endorsing that approach.

By the 1950s, that attitude had changed to: ""Invest what you can afford to lose"". I doubt if many people in 2021 are taking that approach as long as the current optimism reigns.

Next old saying: ""Invest in stocks using 100 minus your age"". So if you are 25, you should be 75% invested in stocks, etc.

Next old saying is an update of the previous saying: ""Invest in stocks using 110 minus your age"". So if you are 25, you should be 85% invested, etc. (I always like how the conventional wisdom updates itself in a seemingly rational manner but with no more evidence than before.)

Ask today, and a lot of people would say, ""Invest it all in stocks"". A decade with a really good stock market causes that statement to appear as wisdom.

Very impressed with your statement that *""I'm in my 20s so I can ride it out"".* Can you, or you just think you can? One of the most common opinions I see on reddit is that everyone plans to stay fully invested no matter how low the stock market sinks. Let's hope they do. If there is no panic selling and everyone buys all the dips, then the market will never go down regardless of the economy, as the individual investors will buy shares when the professionals and insiders are selling. Professionals and insiders would like that very much. Of course, if all the individual investors are fully invested before stock prices begin to fall, then who will buy the stocks to maintain their prices? In a market if every buyer needs a seller, then every seller needs a buyer.

I was reading an old stock investment book written nearly 90 years ago, and the author makes two points about individual investors: they buy at the top and hold on all the way to the bottom before they sell. Wait, wait: this is 2021 and this time is different."

QQQ) is a pretty likely way to lose money in the long run - the better a certain market sector has performed recently, the worse the expected returns for that same sector tend to be (although that is not a sure thing). As always, past performance is not indicative of future returns. The US had a fantastic last decade while ex-US stocks lagged - but there's no guarantee that this will repeat the next decade or the next 20-30 years. The decade starting 2000 saw US lag ex-US stocks. In truth, it's very hard to tell what the future holds for a certain market cap size, sector or country.

It was quite an interesting read and I immediately began searching for a listed company that might be linked to this kind of research. I had no success and then the entire topic kind of slipped my mind...I was just thinking of it again and hoped maybe someone had some information on whether or not this was something that could be invested in yet?

2021-06-17 11:02:11,stocks,Switch looks promising. I bought some calls. It is slowly ticking up today. Hopefully it keeps going that way. I need to make up for paperhanding my ATOS calls too early today.
2021-06-17 11:23:47,stocks,"I bought $20k of Switch yesterday.  It has a nice steady incline.  It is forecasted to go over a hundred a share (five years), and $35 a share by next year.  Not too many people know about Switch.  

Switch has a good customer base.  

In addition, they are working with Dell and FedEx.  The companies plan to build technology hubs across the United States that will be capable of supporting multiple cloud environments with Switch’s edge data centers and Dell Technologies’ cloud infrastructure. The hubs will be placed in strategic, secure FedEx locations, with the first underway in Memphis, Tenn. This combination creates the foundation for a consistent experience across multiple cloud platforms.

This initiative will focus on bringing multi-cloud resources and exascale compute power closer to where customers run their businesses. Taking this approach allows organizations to make real-time decisions using capabilities like artificial intelligence, machine learning and 5G.

FedEx will provide the real estate and a portion of the construction and infrastructure costs. As the first consumer of these services, FedEx will provide enterprise end-user technical expertise as the basis for end-state product offerings. These deployments will provide low latency access to high density compute from FedEx operational locations, helping to power the digital innovations introduced by the company as FedEx transforms how data and technology are used in the global supply chain.

They announced on June 2nd the primary location of its Fifth Prime data center campus in Texas. The land purchase agreement with Dell Technologies will allow Switch to construct over 1.5 million square feet of its highly resilient Tier 5® data center space next to Dell's global headquarters in Round Rock, Texas. The Fifth Prime campus will be called ""The Rock."""

2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Lake DD: Covid-19 PPE winner with too much long term upside to ignore, despite market volatility LAKE is a stock that caught my attention during the pandemic and slowly (and then less slowly when the bubble happened) became one of my largest positions. Even in the short term, the global pandemic is far from over and LAKE is well divested internationally. PPE in other industries than healthcare longer term I believe will benefit from the need for global warming relief, a lot of emergency servicemen are needed, they all have various PPE for their line of work. This is not just masks (also it is a big part of it)

This stock dropped off massively, most likely inexperienced investors taking gains thinking the ride is over, but overlooking the long-term advantages this company has could be a mistake.

Pros:

Microcap of 170M, has 53M in cash: I don't feel like calculating how much value this is per share this time, but run the numbers if you want. If they give some of this money back via a 1 time dividend, people will buy back into the stock and it will recover in the short term too.

Future-Proof Defensive stock: Great hedge against climate change caused economic fallout long-term, as well as future pandemic proofing, which is obviously in demand in the healthcare industry now.

International Investment/Opportunities: With the pandemic coming to an end in the US, Lake will look to foreign markets to foster growth opportunities abroad. In the long term, this can help them gain exposure to international markets after the pandemic is over, which will mean the next pandemic, LAKE products will be EVERYWHERE. If it happens anyway.

Cons:

short term volatility investment: This stock likely will be overlooked a long time before its not. Keep that in mind. That is all. But right now, this is a risk for some, because this is a stock that has become much more volatile lately than it historically has. If your aware of current market sentiment, you are likely already pricing this in, but there is some short term risk right now

Potential VERY long term: Be prepared to wait over a decade potentially for the investment to pay off. Eventually another pandemic will probably happen or another disaster that will require insane PPE demand. If you buy, hold for the very long or stay very active on the news of this stock."
2021-06-16 22:23:42,stocks,I like it. Buying some tomorrow. Just told a guy not to buy trends but buy undervalued stocks. This looks undervalued. If revenue decreased by half this would still be a good buy at this price.

>[CureVac NV](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CVAC:US) shares plunged after a preliminary analysis of a large study muddied by the spread of virus variants found its Covid-19 vaccine was 47% effective, well short of the high bar set by other messenger RNA shots.  
>  
>The interim analysis of data from about 40,000 volunteers included 134 Covid cases, the German company said in a statement. CureVac declined to say how many who got the shot got sick or how many received a placebo. But the results suggest the vaccine works less well for older people than in a younger population, Chief Technology Officer Mariola Fotin-Mleczek said in an interview Wednesday.  
>  
>Though preliminary, the results throw the future of the vaccine into question as wealthy nations around the world move swiftly to inoculate their populations with shots already available. Still, CureVac will finish its trial and plans to gain approval, Chief Executive Officer Franz-Werner Haas said.  
>  
>“There is a huge need for vaccine, and I think we can still make a contribution,” Haas said.

Curevac is down more than 50% after market. This is another shock after many delays and other bad news. Looks like they will miss out on the global vaccine effort."
2021-06-17 04:24:55,stocks,"If I rather recently went in on curevac basically now taking the full brunt of the drop, what would you recommend? It's not life changing money as I knew it was a gamble, but still kinda annoying obviously.

The fact is that Curevac is likely to miss out on the vaccination effort and won't be able to fulfill any of the existing orders. If we write off the entire effort, what substrate remains for the company?

My personal rule is to not sell in the (deep) red unless I have a very clear plan. This free fall right here is probably the wrong place to sell unless you believe the company won't survive this. I would try to find something promising to rotate into and wait for a bit of a recovery. Not financial advice though."

I get your point but I just disagree with it. I think a better statement would be don’t invest in a company that you don’t understand. I work in big pharma (research side) and I barely understand how this place makes money considering the money that is spent on R&D and clinical trials. That’s why I mostly avoid pharma and healthcare as a whole. 

The one exception I made to that rule was Moderna when I saw the crazy amount of money the US gov was offering to our company to begin working on a Covid vaccine."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Is there a serious liquidity problem in the country right now despite inflation? Many people had to resort to unconventional jobs and income sources during the pandemic to make money, with gig jobs and frequent turnover in small businesses across the globe. Some of these people have grew once -small income streams into legitimate business operations, but will not be able to get any leverage for a while because of lack of consistency with income which is more important than your FICO score. Financially responsible people trying to fund legitimate business opportunities in the future that haven't made money consistently or are younger that 2 years (hasn't been 2 years since the pandemic yet),during the pandemic will have trouble for now.

&#x200B;

With rampant market speculation driving down legitimate fundamental investments as we all wait for a 'certain' bubble to pop that will not be named. People wanting to finance these new opportunities are kind of hung dry right now, but it is very hard for people in this situation to get fixed-rate loans right now.

The fact that huge businesses too are still enjoying cheap debt is also noteworthy. 

I worry about the intermediate and short term implications of this in addition to everything else that is going on in the market right now."

2021-06-17 03:29:53,stocks,"Just to be clear, they weren't even loans. They were forgiven, making them basically grants.

The way it was written, as long as you maintained payroll, you basically had 100% forgiveness.

If you were a business that was shut down, that money kept people on payroll without them having to work. If you weren't shutdown, all of the loan turned into net profit. Literally"
2021-06-17 03:26:38,stocks,"This is true but it has to do with regulations more than liquidity problems.

I've had to raise money a lot for small businesses. I've never been able to get a bank to agree. All debt I have raised has been in the private sector."
2021-06-17 04:48:31,stocks,"The payroll portion was a grant. If a business took 1 million dollar loan, spent 500k on payroll. The payroll portion would be forgiven and the remainder 500k would turn into a  regular business loan at 1 % interest, I believe after a few years the interest would go up to 3% which is basically free money. If you had income during hte shutdown you basically had 100% pure profit."
2021-06-17 00:13:41,stocks,Fair enough lol
2021-06-17 05:26:41,stocks,"That's not correct. 

60% had to be used on current payroll (if I remember correctly, it's been a few months since I applied for forgiveness). The payroll also had variable timeframes that you could apply it too.

So you could have had $1M loan, $600k payroll and still had it 100% forgiven (assuming the rest of the expenses where qualified, which was easy to do)"
2021-06-17 06:15:43,stocks,ok you are correct. but what I am saying is any portion not forgiven is treated as a low interest loan.

They own a number of other of studios hand have a lot of unused IP (Franchises that they can continue) and a lot of games in the pipeline for the next 3 years. Analysts at Jeffries set a price target of $230+, which is what I would agree with. They also have a long term deal with WWE to make their games and just announced a new deal to make multiple games with the NFL which may become rival games to Madden which is expected to continue. We are also likely to see a GTA 6 somewhere around 2023. GTA 6’s predecessor was the highest grossing video game of all time generating over $6 Billion in revenue. GTA 6 is also expected to be significantly more advanced and complex than its predecessor leading to a next gen experience. They have a total of 90+ games over the next 5 years.

2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"FOMC statement 6/16/2021 TLDR: No change to monetary policy. The Fed still thinks inflation is temporary and is going to let the economy run hot until unemployment comes down before it starts hiking rates. Still buying bonds $120b/mo at a time. See you next quarter. 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210616a.htm

>The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.

>Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.

>The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain.

>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.

>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Mary C. Daly; Charles L. Evans; Randal K. Quarles; and Christopher J. Waller."

2021-06-17 10:20:31,stocks,Oil crashed during the pandemic so yes it made sense to invest in it then for the rebound. But oil prices have been on a downtrend for many years.

2021-06-17 00:51:23,stocks,"I'm not saying it's the FED's responsibility to fuel bubbles. I'm saying their hands are tied. They know that increasing the rates too much (or even hinting that they might) could cause huge shocks to the economy on multiple levels.

There's a huge amount of speculation in real estate. Higher rates mean that people can't get mortgages as big, which necessarily makes home prices go down. A lot of the economy is real estate (building, selling, mortgages, etc). If you make home prices go down, you're hurting a huge portion of the economy. Higher rates also means people with variable-rate mortgages see their payments go up, and people who have to renew their mortgages do too. You could see a big increase in foreclosures.

As I pointed out, higher interest rates also mean higher interest payments on the government's debt: ""Every percentage point that interest rates rise means, roughly, that the U.S. government must pay $140 billion more per year on $14 trillion of debt, thus directly raising the deficit by about 10%."""

They followed up their brief phone call with a polite email and attached a PDF to sign an NDA to keep their latest acquisition on the hush. Within the PDF they want to know:

* The name of the stock at the time of purchase
* Current name of the stock
* Total number of shares purchased
* Full name the shares were registered under

&#x200B;

My relative never disclosed any sensitive information with the exception of her email address which has her name in it. This is so obviously fraud because:

* Why on earth would this firm spread the news of their acquisition before it's public knowledge
* Why would they cold call rather than acquiring shares on the public market
* How/why would a seemingly small firm acquire a fairly large insurance firm

&#x200B;

I am curious what they could do with this information, could they transfer these shares into an account under their control?

* The stock currently trades at $47.72 with a 52 week high of $58.99 (Firesale!!!)
* Compared to other meme stocks, **$CRTX** has extremely low float (meaning it is subject to much more volatile swings and has a much higher likelihood of massive upswings with high volume. **$CRTX= 14.35m float.** Contrast this with WKHS (113.38m) CLOV (112.78M), NKLA (171.77M), BBBY (103.40M)
* **Catalysts-** As this is a relatively newly traded company, there are many potential upcoming catalysts such as

1. clinical trial reports, (**$CRTX** is currently in phase 2/3)
2. Business wire (a Berkshire Hathaway company) recently wrote a report stating: Cortexyme is **advancing a pivotal trial** in Alzheimer’s disease **with topline data expected in the fourth quarter of 2021** and a **growing pipeline** of therapeutics for degenerative diseases.

However, there are some consequences to having fractional shares if you care about voting rights, the ability of your broker to lend out your shares to shorts, and stock splits.  Also, if the stock you want to trade is very volatile, your broker may restrict what you can do with fractional shares similarly to how they restrict what people can do on margin.  For the most part, though, if you just want to buy low and sell high, there really is no reason not to trade fractional shares if you don't have a ton of cash to trade with."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Are we in a stock market bubble? Or are these reasonable prices based on rising inflation? The official CPI year-over-year inflation rate is 5%, but annualizing the last 3 months of data puts inflation at 8%.  Worse yet, if we use the traditional CPI components, not the misleading ones used in recent years, then inflation is over 12%."
2021-06-16 23:02:26,stocks,We're in new territory cuz of the pandemic.  Higher prices fix higher prices.  Inflation will subside and the markets will advance.  Think long term.

2021-06-16 21:52:29,stocks,"Lol at everyone saying inflation is coming. Inflation is not coming. 

No we are not in a bubble. Stock prices are reasonable given the current environment of trillion dollar stimulus after trillion dollar stimulus and 0% interest rates. As soon as those change stocks will reflect the new information and come down."

2021-06-17 04:33:52,stocks,"> So there will be no bubble.

That conclusion is not supported by the first part of your comment. These are exactly the conditions that lead to bubbles. In fact the bubble has been inflating since 2016."
2021-06-17 08:42:30,stocks,"Agreed. What are people going to do with all their inflated money, put it in a savings account?"

2021-06-16 21:09:24,stocks,"Lumber futures have nothing to do with the real spot market where lumber actually changes hands. Lumber is up but barely 15% at major retailers compared to a few years ago. But major builders dont actually buy from retailers. They go straight to the source. Lumber mills have already stated that their prices have not changed much, if at all, the last year.

There is no shortage of lumber nor is there any major influx of building happening which is the crux of the problem with real estate... we have had a shortage of building for well over a decade. There hasnt been a major real estate building boom since early 2000s. Before that it was the early 90s. Why? Because builders got hit hard in the financial crisis and have been playing it safe since then. They are growing, but slow and steady which has not met demand in the least. Couple that with stupid interest rates and you have what we have now. It will take years and years of building to reverse the housing inflation. Its not going to just crash this time. Even if interest goes up, people are not going to give up the homes they bought. Investors might, if rent doesnt go up, but otherwise, they probably wont either.

Stocks are indeed inflated. No doubt about it but its definitely selective. Its absolutely not market wide. Its almost entirely due to highly speculative plays of which, we have record amounts of new speculative companies with insane PE's and promises of being the next 1%er and fools are lapping it up... not realizing only 1 out of 100 of these companies will actually be the 10 bagger. 50 will likely bankrupt and about 30 will be around average. But they are gambling anyway."
2021-06-16 20:46:56,stocks,"Bingo. Its definitely not market wide. If you look at blue chips and such, they are not much higher than historic levels.

What we are seeing is unprecedented levels of gambling on highly risky speculative plays. People who missed the boat on whatever stock (like Tesla), are now hoping to catch the next 10 bagger. That they dont realize is the odds are about 1% they hit a home run... and they are completely ignoring stocks that generate consistent singles."
2021-06-17 12:52:44,stocks,The perma bear has a bearish view?!!?
2021-06-17 12:20:45,stocks,"You appear to be a new investor, so you are still learning.  Minor price fluctuations happening a couple weeks ago are not a ""bear market"".

A ""bear market"" is a protracted period, often lasting years, when the market goes down significantly and stays down.  The last true bear market was from 2008 to 2012, triggered by the sub-prime mortgage crisis.  The Dow dropped from around 12,000 to 7,000.  The Dow did not recover to 12,000 until 2012.

The 2020 COVID market drop and rapid recovery are more of a ""panic""  than a ""bear market"".  The cause of a panic is transitory and does not reflect underlying problems with stock valuation or market mechanisms.  The Panic of 1907 was the most famous until COVID."
2021-06-16 21:23:55,stocks,"Etymologically, the history of this is actually interesting. I don't own the currency it refers to, but during its last run-up in 2018 or so, someone got drunk after trying to time the swings down and up.

I think many of us have seen a stock go up and down when we just started investing and thought: ""hey, what if I just keep buying this when it goes down and selling when it goes up?"" Most of us, I assume, know how easy this looks, but how difficult it is to do profitably.  


So this person, who tried to swing the currency, wrote a post on reddit that it's impossible to time these swings, and the title was JUST HODL. His drunk typo turned into a very commonly used word.

2021-06-16 22:33:34,stocks,"It’s generally bad for the market. Inflation causes increases in costs and wages for companies. That erodes profits. Thus, traditionally growth stocks do poorly in times of inflation while value stocks do better."

2021-06-16 23:02:03,stocks,"how so? with the rise of interest rate, people are draw toward Tbills which cause shifts in the fund from the market."
2021-06-16 21:35:59,stocks,"Bigger companies absolutely have their own supply chain and deal directly with mills. Smaller ones might go through retail but even then they are very discerning.

Now there is a rise in costs, but its not the lumber specifically, its actually the freight. Transportation costs are up. Its not gas either, its wages and its supply and demand. 

The bottom line is internet shopping is still growing. It has not plateaued and the delivery infrastructure hasn't grown with it. Our roads are not growing as fast demand has grown and we simply dont have enough drivers. To make matters worse, as traffic increases, commutes increase, exasperating the problem. Commute times are a huge huge HUGE problem. Traffic is a absolute supply cost killer. We had no problems during covid but now that we are all going back and since people have become even more addicted to home delivery... well... you cant depend on uber drivers for long range freight..."

2021-06-16 23:37:10,stocks,"As a swing trader, perhaps something you may find even more relevant than finding good tickers is a risk management structure you understand. 

You can’t control the market but you can control your money. 

There are ways you can manage your funds so that even if you read the market wrong, or buy too high, a reversal catches you, whatever it is, you can completely mitigate a negative position then turn it to profit, without having to hold indefinitely waiting for recovery. It’s called trading within your leverage."
2021-06-17 05:58:20,stocks,"My simple advice:

-Trade the 6 month chart.

-Doing nothing pays dividend, meaning that if it stays flat 12 weeks, no need to alter/close the trade (i.e. retail this year).

-Do look at market cap, avg volume and short interest (+15% s.i. will 'deactivate' the breakouts, i.e. TLRY, RKT, SPCE)."

2021-06-17 08:20:50,stocks,"Basically never

Occasionally I'll do small day trades, 0.5-1% of portfolio, with cash where I think it might have a good day but if it's not doing what I thought it would I immediately get out.  I'll only lose like 5% of 1% when it goes bad, and I have gained 30% on that 1% occasionally too, like when Harley Davidson bounced in Feb after it's huge earnings dip"

Note that their net has been sideways for over 5 years despite new phones and what have you. So its not surprising that its valuation got stuck. Obviously, cant hold 30 PE without big growth but if the last 2 quarters were real, it will zip right up.

I do think the services growth might have been impacted by COVID stay at home. I think that folks going back to work may damper that growth but not stop it. I also think phone sales were just pent up demand from the prior year and that growth may not be sustainable.

Nothing to panic about honestly, but thats the bear argument."

I totally agree that if you’re counting on others to do the updates it will never be done right. Some will be on point and some won’t.

If you believe there's a speculative frenzy put 60% of your money into value stocks and international markets (less overpriced). Then put 40% of your money into shorts on NASDAQ and S&P. 

That way you profit on the differing performance. If markets rise due to inflation your value stocks will perform well counteracting the loss in your shorts. If the market crashes your shorts will do well counteracting the loss in your value stocks. Ideally in a crash the expensive NASDAQ would plummet faster than value stocks.

If you can time crashes, you know when the peaks are (just before, duh), and you'll make a killing. Way better than averaging.

If you can time crashes, which you can't. Sure. But the point is that timing the bottom is near impossible, not that it is somehow worse than dollar cost averaging."

Why are you referencing the DOW if you're talking about Europe lol. Also, the dow dipped in late 2007 but rallied up again in 2008, only to then drop significantly. I fact, in April 2008 it was the same value as April 2007, the wobble in late 2007 to early 2008 looked like previous and comparable market fluctuation.  

>Worst so far. Do recessions happen anymore?

Worst for 90 years. That's exactly why I said lifetime. Recessions do happen but there need to be so many factors that come in play, large, deep global recessions are once every few generations. Please pay more attention becuase I'm not interested in tangential arguments from you not reading what I specifically posted. 

>Yeah, just like right now. You're offering explanations as if they were refutations. They aren't. Those things happened. They can happen again.

Oh, glad you admit that those years of 200 to 2006 are now the boom years, despite previously saying they weren't, and listing them as a period of recession because ""the dow was flat"" (even though it actually wasn't during that period and gained by 50% (from around 1000 to 1500)).

>This isn't r/comprehensiveindicatoroftheeconomy.

Well that's for sure, becuase you're the one using the dow as if it is. It's one indicator, like the S&P is, like the 10 year treasury note is etc. Why you're clinging on to the dow, I don't know but it shows a lack of broad understanding about economics.

2021-06-16 21:18:46,stocks,From monmouth poll 46% of people want biden's overspending families plan to pass as it is and other 46% want it to be significantly trimmed or just not pass it at all. It's very likely that majority of swing states voters now want it to at least be significantly trimmed. Inflated price will probably stay high but inflation in the long run should be calm. If inflation continues to be high in July the numbers should be even more favorable for these bills to be significantly trimmed or completely blocked.

If the stock price goes up 7% I make a 21% return, 23% and I double my money.  If it drops 9% I take a 50% loss.

I’m pretty confident in this company. They have been consistently growing profits and sales every year and do a very good job writing efficient claims. Buffet who owns Geico raves about how well run progressive is. 

The buy is like 1% of my portfolio so pretty trivial, I can afford to take on some risk."

2021-06-16 21:55:56,stocks,"Big money still isn’t happy about the current ever growing rate of retail money entering the market and buying every dip. Banks are fucking pissed because they are sitting on trillions of dollars thinking they are going to get to buy some giga mega dip but it’s never coming, that’s why they and their bear buddies have been trying to force the fed to their whims, never works out for them, they should just cover, buy, and go long. Retail won’t be leaving"
2021-06-16 23:28:23,stocks,"If you wait until the Fed actually announces a rate hike, you'll be caught holding the bag. If you hear it on the news, it's already too late, right?

People want to sell at the top, which probably means cashing out long before the Fed says anything."
2021-06-16 23:51:36,stocks,"Banks mad because retail will never give them a dip to buy lol, them and the bears keep trying so hard with these fake bear narratives that only complete newbies would fall for, funny thing is...is the S&P had super good years the years where rates were rising the most.

2021-06-16 22:07:21,stocks,Peter Lynch was right. People lose more money trying to predict when corrections happen than from the correction itself. It now two straight negative catalyst with the CPI release last week that blew up in those people faces.

2021-06-16 22:15:42,stocks,"Depends on the etfs. The point of etfs is to give you exposure to multiple companies/sectors. Some etfs provide more diversification than others, of course. Take VT for example, it's the entire world market. But then you can have something like SMH which only focuses on semiconductors. Broad market etfs are probably the safest since you're exposed to a large variety of companies, while sector/theme etfs are more risky because you're exposed to a smaller, more specific group."

2021-06-17 04:58:17,stocks,"15.67 p/e is good for a company you don't expect to grow much. Do you think Nintendo's earnings will *grow* substantially past what they are now? 

Personally I think they'll do well just to remain flat because current earnings include Switch sales which sell out almost instantly everywhere. That's not gonna last forever. 

They need a sequel to the switch and that's where we find out if they can turn this into an Xbox/playstation type generational console or if it's a one hit wonder."
2021-06-17 05:23:42,stocks,"I like Nintendo a lot and consider them to be the Apple of video game companies.

Game companies tend to rise and fall quickly but Nintendo has managed to remain at the top of their game throughout the years. They have a long history of successful innovation and putting out quality products. They basically stand on their own in the gaming universe and have perfected the method of hooking fans from youth to adulthood. It’s as big of a moat as you can get in the industry.

That said a lot of their future growth depends on the success of their next big console. It’s going to be hard to replicate the success of the Switch. But I think they will eventually find a winner even if it takes them a couple tries, and their loyal fanbase will carry them through any rough times."

2021-06-16 21:59:42,stocks,"I agree. Investing is easy now. Apps and $0 commissions  changed the game. It's insane but it's pretty funny to watch. Eventually it will probably end poorly for some people though, unfortunately.

2021-06-16 23:38:54,stocks,"Yea except a 0.5% rate hike in 2 years doesn’t really do much.

If  appl was releasing a new phone and computer with Microsoft power deal and a new car with hookers you would buy the dip twice ! It’s America shits going green !

2021-06-16 22:02:02,stocks,"I’m extremely confident today was a classic bear trap, I’ve seen this shit before, might be a multi day one but the over exaggerated futures that are fading to green indicate Tuesday and wednesday were a bear trap"
2021-06-16 20:15:11,stocks,"As in, average down on your pick if it’s down 5-10%. Sometimes we just see red and think that it’s a dip. If we buy 1-2% dips, are we really lowering our cost basis a significant amount? Or are we spending more and staying in the same place?"
2021-06-16 20:16:44,stocks,I guess it isn’t significant enough to buy unless it’s down 5-10%? Not sure either.
2021-06-16 20:17:44,stocks,Now I'm sad that there isnt a secret strategic covenant for me to wear jeans and eat hamburgers with.

Try buying things with good long term prospects, big tech is obviously going to be good long term like apple and Microsoft or google, also semi stocks like TSM and qualcomm are going to do well also. Throw in a few ark etfs and index etfs like SPY and QQQ and maybe some banks to balance it out"

2021-06-16 22:04:39,stocks,I think the Nasdaq is going to roar big one more time before the Fed eventually has to react to inflation and tanks it. The only thing that I think can actually save them is if wages actually keep up with inflation. I think they're banking on a strong labor market to bailout the easy-money bubble they've created.
2021-06-17 00:28:18,stocks,Those exaggerated futures are still red as hell…

2021-06-16 21:05:54,stocks,Seven and i is a fucking tank though.
2021-06-16 20:30:23,stocks,I’d say so! I just took a look at the chart. Looks like it found a bottom around $115 mid May and has been reversing/consolidating since then. If it can break the $165 resistance that would be a good sign. I see nice support around $145. My only concern is the death cross on the 1 day chart. Could be a choppy week or so. But I’m sure this is a long play of yours?
2021-06-16 21:42:15,stocks,I will buy the dip before you do
2021-06-17 13:13:04,stocks,I think I screwed up and may have actually sold at a loss 😅. I'm pretty new to all of this so I'm trying to understand along the way. So I bought in yesterday at a lower average and it has gone up today but I think I may have accidentally sold at a loss the first time. I'll have to look through my history. Anyways my unrealized gain/loss is red when I thought I would have been positive since buying in yesterday and the price being up today.
2021-06-16 20:53:45,stocks,Tesla is up on the day even after netting after hours.

2021-06-17 15:31:01,stocks,Exactly my concern too. Seems expensive and a little sketchy (but maybe normal?).
2021-06-16 20:45:43,stocks,I use the PE to know how concerned I need to be around expectations.   If it’s high and you miss then it’s look out below.   Also they can be ripe for rotations in market corrections.   They might not be in favor for the next run.   When possible I try to get where I get my initial investment back so I can ride the dips if I think I am at the beginning of a long run winner.
2021-06-17 04:28:13,stocks,Yeah I've got a little Jim Cramer system going that's earning about 2% per week so far. I'm not trusting any large amounts of money  to it though...

2021-06-17 12:18:33,stocks,I think  the only thing paper trading is good for is teaching you how to use the platform that your trading on and how to trade but to equate the actual practice of stock trading with simulation is unrealistic at best.  No emotional bias which makes the simulation of trading unrealistic.  Watch some you tube videos about trading basic stocks.  Get familiar with the terminology then get a paper trading account to get familiar with the platform like webull or TOS. In doing so you'll learn what you need to know.
2021-06-17 03:21:31,stocks,Just need to use the Fidelity app for fractional shares. Overall love Fidelity.
2021-06-16 21:05:25,stocks,"Their interface is terrible and they hide limit trades which IMO every beginner should be using. It’s when you set the price you will buy or sell for instead of whatever the market maker happens to match you with. 

Not a fractional guy but I use Merrill edge, E-trade, and Fidelity. Of those I’d recommend Merrill to a beginning investor and E\*TRADE if you plan on becoming more advanced - their E\*TRADE Pro is decent for day/options trading.

Add: If you want to build wealth get your brokerage account setup with your employers direct deposit - we have a surprising ability to adapt our spending habits to what’s in our checking accounts. 

Take it out before you see it and invest in indexes - their low cost guarantees you’ll always be within spitting distance of the benchmarks.

Making $12/hr I managed to get up to 21% of my gross earnings going into my brokerage before finances became difficult (2007). 2021 expenses are way more than what I was dealing with but push as much as you can in there. Time and compounding are amazing."

2021-06-17 16:51:47,stocks,"Let me get this straight: should I buy REITs because you sold your house at a profit? How is this even remotely relevant? Most REITs deal with offices and commercial RE, not in residential properties. Even if that was the case, you selling a house doesn't tell anything about future rental incomes in the RE market. Neither it tells anything about future prospects for the housing market overall.

My simple point was that it's not just because something  is cheap that is good to buy. There are a lot of uncertainties in the market when it comes to REITs, and that is why they are priced as they are.

2021-06-17 07:57:26,stocks,"If you're a PC gamer, then whether you like the brand or not you'd realize that Corsair has a pretty damn large brand recognition among gamers. It's *considered* to be a good brand, and that's more important at times than actually being a good brand.

People have the impression that their products are good, and the valuation for corsair looks to be pretty solid at the current levels. Obviously the whole ""jump to $40+ in a day"" is a bit extreme, but I'm in for 100 @ $31.36 after factoring in a call I sold when it was in the high 30s (I missed the 41-42 mark on monday sadly or I would've just sold and rebought) and I have zero regrets about owning these shares."
2021-06-17 07:51:46,stocks,"I mean... This is completely anecdotal. Sometimes shit like that happens-- Corsair is usually a pretty safe bet though. My last Corsair PSU lasted for 7 years before I had to replace it-- and if there wasn't a ridiculously good deal on an off brand PSU with really good reviews, I probably would've gone with Corsair again. 

Most people hold them in high regard-- both in gaming and in investing. I'm in for 100 @ around 31.50 after CCs are factored in and I don't really regret it at all. I'm not entirely sure why you have such a hateboner for Corsair.

They're not the best, but they're a pretty damn solid company with solid products, regardless of your own personal negative experience with one of their products. It's very rare that I've seen a bad review ratio for them, if ever."
2021-06-17 08:10:26,stocks,"If shit happens it's not a safe bet. If you go to an actual trusted specialist review site and they say it can happen a lot, it's especially not a safe bet. My cheap nobrand blue coloured chinese psu that i got used lasted longer than my corsair. That must mean chinese noname is a safer bet than corsair."
2021-06-17 09:57:09,stocks,"You rely far too much on your personal one-time experience with a product if you're defining your opinion about an entire brand because of said experience. I didn't invest in Corsair or think it's a good value at my price because of my good experience with them, I actually do look at reviews and generally have a good grasp of how people view the brand (or at least I think I do), and people tend to view it as a decent quality one.

Obviously people like you who have had negative experiences would disagree, but I'm pretty confident that you're in a fairly small minority. And going by the average rating for Corsair PSUs even just scrolling through Amazon (as well as their popularity), I'd say I'm right with that, as opposed to looking at an unnamed ""trusted specialist review site"" that's probably just someone confirming your bias rather than an actual view of sentiment towards Corsair or the consensus about their product quality."
2021-06-17 10:51:39,stocks,"Nah, you rely far too much on your personal one time experience with a product. Who the fuck sticks around with a shit company to have two bad experiences lol. Can you go back to wsb and keep your pump and dump promotion contained there?"
2021-06-17 11:05:48,stocks,"That doesn't even make sense lol. You can't just say ""no u"" when I explicitly say why I bought Corsair and why I think it's a good investment.

I'm also... not from WSB? I don't post there, at least not actively, and I've never been one to browse that sub. My first time purchasing Corsair was on 3/06, and I had 80 shares before this spike even happened.  Again, my cost basis is around $31.50. Would be pretty hard to get that if it was a pump and dump-- and I wouldn't still own the shares after it was $40+ on Monday in that case, either.

Edit: Cost basis just got $1.22 lower per share. Ain't covered calls grand? The trick isn't to be a WSBer, it's to capitalize on those suckers that do stupid shit like buy massively OTM calls a month out based on meme volatility."

I'm not holding out any hope that you're not just a troll with a chip on your shoulder about Corsair, but I'm genuinely positive on the company. I don't give a fuck about what WSB people do or say, but I'm thankful to them for generating hype and making the stock more valuable for me. 

I'm gonna laugh if your next angle of attack is that investing $3k~ into a stock is too small of a position to talk about or something dumb like that that has nothing to do with the conversation, but I'm happy with my decisions so far, considering this is just one stock of many.

I also didn't buy them because of my experience. As I literally said in my comment before, I bought them because of consumer sentiment + them seeming like a solid company that was a bargain as far as their fundamentals go. I'll stand by this investment over most of the ones I've made tbh. If you're saying that anyone who's ever had a good experience with a company's product can only ever invest in that company solely because of that experience, you're honestly just being ridiculous."

2021-06-16 22:27:32,stocks,"The risk is undetermined pending audit result, BUT the company makes tons of cash, is bringing blockchain to a massive market underpinning global trade. The market cap is tiny so share price can move very rapidly, 16% of float is shorted and borrow rate is super high. This stock has the potential to move up very, very quickly.  
The company said it would buyback shares and did so $50 million worth or 8% of float if I remember right.   
The recent acquisitions have been well met, some folks are uncomfortable with Singapore or still awaiting audit results. Personally I find those risks pretty low bar and the upside potential is massive. It would only take a couple of small whales to 2X or 3X this in a couple of days. I've been accumulating for the past few months and feel the risk reward ratio is great."
2021-06-16 22:42:44,stocks,"Float was 23 million shares they bought back 6.6 million shares.  Last I looked at ortex it was near 7 million shares short.  

I say the audit is moderate risk because of their cash position that has grown significantly since last reporting, even after spending 50 million on share buyback they report 130 million in cash. I also don't call any young company a low risk.   To me this is a clear indicator that they have continued to grow their business and have not been dependant on rhodium.  Rhodium never made that much money so it's clear they have quite a few more users that are bringing them significant income."

2021-06-17 00:46:08,stocks,"While IonQ's publicized system with an \*expected\* QV of 4M would be pretty revolutionary this early in the accelerated development era of QC, I think this assertion of 4M QV should be viewed as a ""forward looking statement"" and the next systems will be lucky to consistently hit QV of 1000-10,000 in actual operation.

Per IonQ's own calculator ([https://ionq.com/algorithmic-qubit-calculator/](https://ionq.com/algorithmic-qubit-calculator/)) they would need 2 qubit gate fidelity of 99.9% across all the gates in their system with ""all to all"" qubit connectivity without ""connectivity error"". I am not sure if the calculator includes other sources of error in real system which would further affect QV: initialization error, single-gate error, measurement error, etc.

I could easily be mistaken, but I don't think IonQ has demonstrated 2-Q gates with that high fidelity or all-to-all connectivity. If fidelity drops from 99.9 to 99.5% OR no ""all-to-all"" connectivity... QV drops to \~1000, or less.  

I don't think you have enough information to discern whom is ahead of whom."
2021-06-17 05:37:28,stocks,"Well I mean sure they published the highest benchmark they can hit, like everyone else would. Records are given for 1 time performance.

""and the next systems will be lucky to consistently hit QV of 1000-10,000 in actual operation"" Probably gonne be a bit higher than that, but I think they just wanted to proof a point. Those aren't really ""commercial"" systems yet. 

""they would need 2 qubit gate fidelity of 99.9% across all the gates in their system"". If you ultimately benchmark that thing, they will use the 22 qubits with the best 2 gate fidelity. Thats how you max the results.

In order to hit the benchmark, all errrors are included. Kinda like running minecraft. Everything counts at that point.   

All of IonQ's systems have all to all connectivity. Thats an architecture thing. You can think about it in term of ""if it is all on the same chain"". If they use Ion Shuttling, I think that might change, but they aren't using it now. 

""I could easily be mistaken, but I don't think IonQ has demonstrated 2-Q gates with that high fidelity ..."" Yeah thats why I said they need to publish the paper.

""I don't think you have enough information to discern whom is ahead of whom."" If they can demonstrate the 4 Mil QV, they are clearly ahead. That's the industry benchmark for the NISQ era. That benchmark comes from IBM and was introduce in order to see who is ahead. 

If you ask: How can I know who is ahead? The consensus answer is: Whoever has the highest QV."

2021-06-17 14:02:48,stocks,"Hi!

So 90% of my deposits every month go into my 'long positions' and 10% go into my trading account for active trading/yoloing whatever I feel like I want to do.

Of the 'long positions' 95% of those are the following ETFs and 5% goes into coins.

Current Long Portfolio: 

* IVV 70% 

* QQQ 15% 

* BOTZ 2.5% 

* ARKG 2.5% 

* IJH 5% 

* cash 5% 

I think I want to redo my long ETFs because I don't really think it's worth while to hold IVV and QQQ. I think I'm going to rebalance and shift to this:

Sell IVV/IJH & Buy VTI Add IYR - BlackRock's REIT ETF

New Portfolio

  * VTI 70% 

  * QQQ 15% 

  * IYR 5% 

  * ARKG 2.5% 

  * BOTZ 2.5% 

  * Cash 5%

I think this gives me better overall coverage, thoughts? Anyone else hold a SPY ETF and QQQ? Redundant? I think I like the rebalance more with the VTI/QQQ/IYR over IVV/QQQ/IJH.

2021-06-17 10:18:56,stocks,"My goal is to have a portfolio with decent dividends as well as at least 10% annual return. I can take on moderate to high risk because of my age (only 27), but during this time I have low confidence in the market so I've recently switched over to safer investments. 

I'd like some input on my portfolio as it pertains to my goals and am open to any critiques.

My portfolio contains the following:

DKNG (DraftKings)
TDOC (Teladoc)
GM
SFY (Sofi select 500 ETF)
FLXN (Flexion therapeutics)
AAPL (Apple)
NTRA (Natera)
AMZN (Amazon)
GOOGL (Google class A)
PYPL (PayPal)
VOO
TSM (Taiwan semiconductor)
JPM (JP Morgan)
SQ (Square)
V (Visa)
ENPH (Enphase)
DOCU (DocuSign)
VRT (Vertiv)
STOR (Store capital REIT)
ILMN (Illumina)
MSFT (Microsoft)
IBM

My recent purchases are IBM, STOR, & FLXN. I get a 1% dividend out of my portfolio.

DKNG, DOCU, ENPH, and GM are my top 4 holdings.

What do you think? Should I have more growth stocks? Should I think it out a bit? Do I need some commodity stocks? Where can I improve?


Thanks!"

2021-06-17 03:33:30,stocks,Sell the SLV and buy PSLV. PSLV is much more trustworthy about their warehouse numbers for more information visit:  [Wallstreetsilver](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/)
2021-06-17 13:59:52,stocks,However you have 50% invested in AST which has only one test sattelite without a proof of concept or any significant revenue
2021-06-17 13:57:00,stocks,"I would find it hard and too time consuming to follow this many companies. I don't think I would even be able to find this many good investments, or atleast the 20th idea won't be as good as the first 10"
2021-06-16 22:26:20,stocks,I would sell plug for tgt
2021-06-17 17:19:45,stocks,CHPT may be better than PLUG.
2021-06-17 03:10:47,stocks,"I'm into ASTS too. If they manage to achieve what they want, i feel like it's gonna be huge (easily 100$+ stock). I see this as one of the best high risk/high reward stock on the market atm. But it's gonna take a few years for sure. Next big thing is the launch later this year. I just hope it won't get caught in the WSB storm (like it did last week when 1 guy tweeted about it being ""shorted"" and it went something like 60% up in one day. That's not healthy at all)."
2021-06-17 17:12:24,stocks,"Solid IMHO. If it was my account, I would add a couple of higher-risk stocks with higher upside (especially over the next 3-5 years)."
2021-06-17 17:07:08,stocks,Very good. What is your year to date
2021-06-17 10:30:34,stocks,Buy some VTI
2021-06-17 13:04:58,stocks,Nice Job on your $330 gains. Stop trading options trade real stocks. Buy BABA along and you will be fine.
2021-06-17 10:53:34,stocks,"At 19 you have compounding on your side. Add some VTI, QQQ, And SCHD. You will outperform 99% of hedge funds over a thirty year period."
2021-06-17 10:42:09,stocks,Keep those make portfolio majority VTI for now on
2021-06-17 03:34:04,stocks,"Holy shit mate. that's so0oo big.

&#x200B;

you defo need to consolidate here. Some good names but you need more consolidation.

&#x200B;

Go for some good conviction stocks. $CRWD, $SQ, $SEA, $PLTR , $FB, $TSLA, are names that frequent quite often."
2021-06-17 10:27:55,stocks,"Maybe get some more value in there or simply buy VTI. I personally keep atkeast 50% in the whole market for safety because you never know what these companies will do 5,10,15 years from now."
2021-06-17 14:53:11,stocks,As an european I know first hand how big Vodefone is. The fact that they have backing from them and that Vodefone are actively working with them to help develop their technologies gives me great encouragement to invest in their company.
2021-06-17 14:51:41,stocks,"I am holding them as kind of a long term retirement fund. I am not even in my twenties yet but I like to have financial freedom and having investments as a backup emergency fund is my plan. As long as they grow even at a slow pace, I don't really mind."
2021-06-17 17:59:41,stocks,Thanks. My rate of return is +12.98% YTD so far.
2021-06-17 10:31:40,stocks,Why?
2021-06-17 15:52:32,stocks,"Moving towards Google, Nvidea, Tesla and Square as my weekly buys"
2021-06-17 03:50:41,stocks,Thanks. I have PLTR in other portfolio. Also indirectly some of the names in ARK in other portfolio. Some of my bottom have a chance to grow. I am looking to drop some that are not worth spending time.
2021-06-17 10:34:34,stocks,"That's been my thought lately - I think need some medium-small cap value stocks. That's why I bought FLXN, and I'm very confident in their product and company. It's harder for me to find them in the rough though. I'll consider VTI though. Thanks for the input"
2021-06-17 11:38:03,stocks,Dividends are what made make the entire markets grow substantially over the years. Focus on growth early then switch to a balance of dividends. People don’t listen to these randos who can’t consistently beat the market and sell at any negative news.
2021-06-17 11:40:26,stocks,S&P index funds like VOO pay dividends quarterly and make sure you have drip turned on to reinvest them. Also SCHD VYM etfs are great dividend producing indexes. Don’t listen to these strangers. Heck even me. Find a financial advisors and read lots of finance books
2021-06-17 11:45:01,stocks,Every portfolio should have a large portion of his/her portfolio in a low cost index such as VTI. You will guarantee to beat the market and 85% of all funds on a yearly bases. It beats out 99% over a 10-30 year time frame as well. Continue to add to individual shares and create a index foundation. You will not be able to beat the market every year and we are at peak bubble so have more diversification will prevent larger drops. We also can’t predict the future 30 years from now so have a index that will adjust for you over time is easy as Sunday morning.
2021-06-17 00:06:24,stocks,"People had no doubt in pets.com either

Edit: I like most of your plays, was just remarking on the “no doubt” part"
2021-06-17 11:08:33,stocks,Slowly add to positions and add VTI
2021-06-17 11:46:34,stocks,VOT is a mid cap growth index and has done very well if you are that interested in the midcap
2021-06-17 19:19:05,stocks,"Dividends do contribute to total returns yes, but  dividends reduce the value of the stock accordingly on the ex dividend date. If the company issues a dividend of 5% on a stock with a price of $100, that stock will drop to $95 and you'll receive $5 in cash on the ex dividend date. If the stock paid no dividend the share price would still be at $100. Of course, it won't be a perfect drop to $95 given that markets fluctuate for any reason. The point I'm trying to make is that dividends are not quite the ""free"" money that they are made out to be."
2021-06-17 12:16:52,stocks,Makes sense. Thank you. Will consider this.
2021-06-17 09:50:42,stocks,I agree. Nothing is guaranteed. I will exit these if my investment thesis changes.
2021-06-17 13:31:23,stocks,Patience is key
2021-06-17 10:49:42,stocks,Just get some VTI
2021-06-16 20:37:17,stocks,Happy I found this. Thank you and I agree wholeheartedly.
