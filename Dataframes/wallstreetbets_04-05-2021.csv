04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If AMD falls to say $79 wouldn‚Äôt this greatly effect your options ?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You forgot to cover what happens if amd heads down a few %. While i know stonks only go up, sometimes they go down."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sitting on 1300 shares.  Down too much to sell so looks like bagholder it is.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve had this stock for awhile.... not much 150 shares,  but I think it has potential. Good DD"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice DD. I am getting some.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Too dumb to own options.
Waiting for it to balance out again."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Shhhh it‚Äôs a DD we don‚Äôt talk about bearish news
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you please elaborate. I have not heard about this.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Accounting fraud?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Well how many shares then
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I found this: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ademi-llp-investigates-claims-of-securities-fraud-against-canoo-inc-301259293.html

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"currently 0. Not worth putting money in a company that's gonna lose to the shorts. Gotta see if some whales want to buy back in. Personally I could see the stock sitting within 20% of what they were before the squeeze (~$11), but it takes a minute to recover after the shorts get back into the game.

[Looks](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigation-alert-kessler-topaz-meltzer-174700683.html) like there CFO is gonna resign, maybe that's a good change.

I really hope you don't buy off of one DD that just bad investing."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I sure as fuck hope you aren't suggesting the class action lawsuits are accounting fraud.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"#OP buys 70,000 IV options and asks for confirmation bias ü§£ü§£"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy stocks not options... DD is true
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre throwing your money away. Stop buying overprice options of GME and get Shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Only thing I can confirm is that is ugly

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GME only goes up
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôll be good tomorrow! 210-217 too easy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,U are literally fucking your fellow apes in the ass. Buy shares you bitch
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,With options dated that short you need a significant move within a day or two or your asshole is going to bleed. The theta loss needs to be offset by a gain in intrinsic value or it‚Äôs still a net loss.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GME go brrrr
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck bro.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude...you‚Äôll be selling ITM tomorrow after lunch...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I would sell on the first spike up. FDs have only a small window to profit
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Confirmed - you are retarded, if a week or two early"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk why you‚Äôre nervous? Gme only goes up we all know this

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,By my estimates you've still got a ticket to the moon
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Patience!

That‚Äôs jarring to see, but I would bet 9-to-1 odds that you‚Äôre at least +20% green by Thursday afternoon."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"its monday and you're crying already?

gtfo and go back to investing in Coca Cola you pussy"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can confirm you're f\*\*ked
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, sell. Who knows when it'll pop up."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Weeklies are dumb. Shoulda bought some leaps or shares. Max pain is killing weeklies the past 5 weeks
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think youll be fine, gme is inevitably gonna moon"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I almost bought some for the $200 strike price would have made profit to
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Stay positive
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Covid happened and that was fucking crazy, so the possibility of OP coming on top is pretty high. Hope that helped, Goodluck!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Love this!! I feel your high.  Sell them and roll over to give you extra time.  4/16s are cheap
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"to hedge those options by buying shares would help boost the price, but then it wouldn't be a yolo"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know you are going for the homerun, but I would strongly suggest bull call spreads instead."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock is going to skyrocket you just need to be patient.  Why gamble with options (wasting assets) when you have a sure thing?  Just my $0.02.  I hope you make a boatload of $$$$ but I just don‚Äôt agree with the risk/reward in this situation.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GME will crash they plan to sell stocks
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No Options, Buy Actual Shares. Thank you"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What do the rainbows mean? That there's a pot of gold pit stop before mooning?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If u use thinkorswim just look at the probability metrics for each one. I have good results with that tool. If u use some other platform then sell cause ur fucked on these
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, I lost 100% of my 270$ call for 3/26."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Charge your phone first

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt stop, I‚Äôm almost there"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,youre a fucking idiot
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me know if you get any kind of response worth reading. I grabbed a 180 but then read that 190 is max pain this week soooo. And I know I know buy shares. I did both
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This could very well turn around in your favor.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear ya but the dopamine high just isn‚Äôt the same
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Translation: eat crayons, not paint üöÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not both?!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks brotha üôè
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe some of us like the butt stuff
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear you but if these hit I will 100% exercise doggie. Planning on holding through the week.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This one person literally has no affect on the price of gme. Let him try to make his money.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,As in I‚Äôm gonna buy a fook ton of shares bru - in this with you

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,ü•≤
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Mmmm bears trying to get that cash üòÇüòÇ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"As in, by Friday?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,question is when but ayooo
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is wsb"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Cuck
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How dare you use common sense in here!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude it‚Äôs a 50/50 they‚Äôll print. Wouldn‚Äôt stress it. The 195 will def print
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"the thing is whales are trying to burn down the theta on options thats why you are getting IV crushed. 

not gonna lie its great selling weekly CC on GME right now due to that.

but ya buy shares"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah dude buy stocks not options. Ya killing me smalls
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The losses aren‚Äôt the same either
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Or 185-190 easy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,i dont think you will be making money on this even if it does. it would have to go to 250+ for you to make money. theta is going to burn your premium faster. seriously read up on options and IV crush.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd watch the ticker like a hawk the next few days . GME announcing their plan to sell shares to finance their e-commerce plans is going to have an effect. They said this mornings drop was because of that but I thinks that‚Äôs bs. Volume was a way way down Friday and the long weekend. You could see this mornings drop from a mile away.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Your terms are acceptable
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"... if you were going to exercise, you'd be better off just buying the shares and not burn premium.   


Anyway if these calls get ITM, proof of exercising or ban"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah bruh, if you are gonna exercise buy deep ITM calls and exercise. OTM dont do any good but help the hedgie monster"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You could literally be the one person to suck my dongus and noone would care. Y u no let me nut?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only need a $50 swing upwards. It could happen. Also, it could not happen. Ideally you'll want that to happen before Wednesday. Good luck."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">Joined January 29th

lmao This place is *filled* with FOMO‚Äôers and bag holders now. Sheesh."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Just because it gets to 195 doesn‚Äôt account for the price of the option paid at the beginning.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,brrr
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What's theta got to do with IV?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Volume so low it can spike in either direction tbh
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wednesday IV crush hit different.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your right, I looked at it for 2 seconds and gave him a virtually meaningless response that would neither crush his soul nor give him a raging boner"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,everything. read up on options
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh. ‚ÄúPermabans for bad words‚Äù seems to me that Reddit would lose a significant portion of their client base
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha I was more worried about the Theta burn, but yeah, IV crush on a Wednesday during expiry week got a sweet flavor."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What a kind soul <3
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta is time decay and vega is what adds or reduces value based on IV. IV crush is Vega fucking you and the loss of value over time is Theta cumming in your ear.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel you ! Well I‚Äôm hopeful about your play brother ape ü¶ç and wish you plentiful returns
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I got my kayak from there and getting my covid shot! I like the company a lot and even analysts are at 100% buy which is odd for most ‚ÄúReddit‚Äù stocks but this one is legit. 4/16 calls let‚Äôs go!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain how revenue divided by shares equals a fair value target?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,To many words for my smooth brain. How many rocket ship emojis we talkin here?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you seriously just calculate ‚Äúfair value‚Äù using nothing more than 4th quarter revenues and o/s shares? Because if that‚Äôs what you did, you might be retarded."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you meant overly simplistic DD...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets," Summer is upon us and this is their bread and butter sales period. Kayaks, apparel, fishing equipment, etc. Sales will continue to grow. ASO, Academy Sports and Outdoors sells out of ammunition every week!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Clearly the shorts have never been to one of their stores lol. They‚Äôre always fucking packed
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I just bought in today
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My smooth brain enjoyed this DD. Buying $40 calls expiring next week
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm in, got 140 shares this morning."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck , lotta people gonna be left holding these bags RIP"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are giving out covid shots there? 

Get your buck shot and covid shot all in one place!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes! Time to get in formation

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like a dipshit for not buying in when I was first looking at it at $23.  Kinda late now, but props to those who onboarded the rocket."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha yeah I‚Äôm terrible with grammar:). Just meant that with more vaccines people will be enjoying the summer in full especially with the last year so I‚Äôm confident in the stock and future of academy!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,lets go
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ummm ok...

Maybe you could start with the $2.70 EPS that the company is projecting for next year. And then maybe you could multiply that by some multiple determined by ASO‚Äôs peers (let‚Äôs say 13-15). That would give you a price of $35-$40.  

You used top line revenue from a single quarter. And not just any quarter, you used the quarter that has historically been the highest revenue quarter because of the holidays. At the end of the day, they could have had $50 trillion in revenues and I wouldn‚Äôt have given a single fuck if it cost them $51 trillion to produce said revenue."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn‚Äôt look like we had to wait long. Go eat some more crayons
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was a great play beginning of last week before ER, I remember seeing it I ended up taking $BB earnings instead like a retard. But yea I feel like the ship sailed for this but could be wrong af"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets, 9-1-1.  I'd like to report a murder
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dang he got calculated
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welcome to WSB where the ""fair value"" is made up and the cost of revenue doesn't matter"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Got em
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,OP is humbled
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, title says simple..."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir you are 100 % correct. That‚Äôs word to the PLTR shares & calls I bought today + fubo 

Barcode gang until I‚Äôm out of the trade, then this shit will üìàüöÄ when I‚Äôm out"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Noice.  I wish I had that amount of shares. After the squeeze i will only get one Lambo while rest of you will have a whole dealership lol   üôåüíéü¶çüöÄ

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,ok
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,you need to pre-order one bro
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they will be sold out and go up in price like crazy too. In a way It has already started thats why people are buying VW stonk since it owns Lambo brand, and Porsche. People know squeeze is coming and people will be buying Lambos and Porsches."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn't matter when... but you know that. üòâ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,good enough to screenshot good enough to sell? obviously proud of the gains
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,that rule is for options

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,word? i think it‚Äôs advice imma start living by regardless
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,diamond hands bro
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,diamond hands is for not selling at a loss. you don‚Äôt have paper hands if you take profit.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Motley fool told me to avoid, I may have to buy some."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought shares back in April last year when they were $10. Back when I was poor and didn‚Äôt know much so only have 83. But it‚Äôs made me some money and should continue going up especially with announcing they‚Äôre resuming cruises in early July
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The $25 dip was a nice buy saw them dip and liquidiated what I had easy 20% ride back up
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm all in on CCL...it has less letters and hasn‚Äôt gone up as much as NCLH. Also why I‚Äôm all in on AAL
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,A little too soon on 4/9 for me
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I was thinking the same. Will buy tomorrow.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been holding 100 shares (around 16$ avg, up 60%) since last May and selling covered calls. Hoping to sell by year-end if price recovers to pre-pandemic (or close to) levels."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve had it awhile. Up and down but I‚Äôm ahead 26%.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Up 20k on AMC today. I guess I am in the wrong Forum
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I guess, this isn‚Äôt one of the amc cults you post in everyday. It‚Äôs kinda crazy, I didn‚Äôt  see anywhere in the op talking about amc. So yeah, I guess you are in the wrong post fucktard...."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bet I Banked more on GME than You Did Chump Change

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hello SPY my old friend. Has WSB come full circle on YOLOing SPY again? Cause I‚Äôm ready to lose money with you guys.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats now you have a balance that can produce incredible loss porn.üôå
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Somewhere that dude that bought all those puts is crying while looking at this post...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, would have been nice. I was eyeing 405c expiring today but bought 395 puts Friday instead. Bet the wrong way, fuck me."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,When did you buy those 404 calls??
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Then there‚Äôs me with my 7 SPY shares happy with the 1.5% increase todayüò≠üò≠üò≠
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How come when I try this shit I blow up my account
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"WTF am I doing with my life buying deep ITM AAPL calls hoping for a pathetic 3% return on the best of days. Somewhere along the way I got lost. AAPL is also dogshit, along with PLTR."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to rinse my eyes with loss porn so I don't quit my job.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Congratfukulations !!

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats!!! And a giant Fuck You!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Switch to a better broker and trade $spx. Then 60% of gains are treated as long term capital gains even if you hold for a day.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Holly shit congrats bro

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just taking notes because doing a play like this is the only way I can afford a down payment on a house
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I need to learn option trading.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice 10-bagger
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain this process from start to end? Or at least a link that explains what you looked for, what you bought and when you sold? So lost on contracts."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay you convinced me. (55) .01 SPY 455c 4/16s
  
ETFs only go up, right?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well... At least I made $70

https://imgur.com/a/v4c4HrT"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,wtf.. pls share your next play..
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is calls and options the only way to make big money here or is this for advance traders?  All I know is I have shares. Then, when/if it reaches the astronomical S/P people are predicting which I can't wrap my head around to believe, I'll put them up for sale and see if truly there will be buyers at let's say that 5K price point.....Let's play ball."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Cute

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, this guy is batshit crazy. I have so much respect for him. If this were me I would have been burned alive."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I did this same thing with 15 GME contracts @ 200 4/23 the other day when it bottomed at 118 a share. I bought them at 8:35am literally at the exact bottom. Three minutes later it took off. Within 90 min I was up 71k profit from 24k. That was a fun morning.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,YEAHHH this dude fucks forsure
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This. I love this guy‚Äôs balls
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would say the level of risk is unbelievably stupid unless his total account value is 2 million plus. 

This is a risk game, not a casino. If you treat it as a casino, sooner or later, the odds will get you."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here brother . Was up to 120k at a point . But I knew it would be 90 or 150 next . I accept my retardness.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Its a bot don't take it personal
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"i love this

Schytzo: ""should i buy calls take the easy road or buy puts and take the hard road""

Schytzo's brain: ""the calls are easy money, why the fuk would you even consider puts""

Schytzo's cock: ""buy the puts, dont be a pussy""

Schytzo: ""puts it is""

Schytzo 2 hours later: ""FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUK"""
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thursday
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The real trick is SPXL, 3x leveraged SPY. Who actually thinks the S&P will go down right now? Get you summa that ;)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell that trash and buy SPY calls instead
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§£ü§£ü§£
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I have six shares of the s&p 500 and it's just nice to see it go up. but what sucks is I could have put more money in a few days ago but I was trying to wait for the market to go down so I can put more money in and it never did I gave up and just put money in today
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm eating the same crayons that you are. ü¶ç üñç
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Profit is profit. I‚Äôm more than happy with a 3% gain between my shares and calls in both tickers.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"i‚Äôve been buying ATM aapl calls for a week & a half. $900>$3.6k

would have been 3.6k>6k if i held my 12 $123c i bought thursday & sold this morning at open

[march 24th to today](https://imgur.com/a/7dtLEva/)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR ain't dogshit. just gotta choose/be lucky with your 'catalyst' moments. nothing is quite as day-to-day volatile as $GME.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Gains are gains bro . Another day I will make a little while you will make much more . You are a honest man and you deserve it too - I will hope and pray for it . Congrats on today‚Äôs gains üòÄ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You know what the front page is filled with üòî. Well atleast I am happy to share a OG WSB meme yolo
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,exp 4/5 he's good
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too please. There needs to be a WSB options class or something.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed . Lucky for once üòÄ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree üòÇüòÄ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please don‚Äôt.

Remember for every such gamble that has worked for me - I have lost so much more . My lazy ass filled with pride refuses to share such loss porn many a times 

So this is all a gamble lol . Invest what you could lose"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am sure there are ppl who do this by skill and knowledge 

I am dumb . This is just pure luck and blind gambling"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Balls of steel to be exact.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell us more...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check my comment history brother . I did get a pet 1 month ago and I did share the pics . 

The main reason I am in Reddit is WSB and pet subreddits . I don‚Äôt spam or push anything . Too dumb for that 

I joined WSB years ago seeing yolos - gains and losses on Spy and Tesla . Just felt like sharing Spy yolo I finally got lucky

I can PM you for authenticity üòÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,yea for serious - 400 contracts.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not a üåàüêªbut I love his balls too
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a rare thing around here to sell for less than you could've had. Most wait around wishing for it to go back up and of course it doesn't.

Good job retard"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No it comes from the heart üñïüòÖ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did a $404 contract cost that day?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ballsy dude, congrats"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt try to time the market. It will wait you out, I promise."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt we all wait for that moment hahah
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. If you start with 10K and earn 1% per day and traded all business days per year (262) you'd have $135 thousand. Do that for one more year and you'd have over 1.5 million. Sure you'd pay some taxes, but after a third year you'd have almost 25 million and retire. Good luck with that lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since you like it, what are you looking at as good catalysts? I have shares but have been planning to hold it long term rather than expecting catalysts to launch it"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well put, cheers mate!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's pretty simple since it is just a casino. 


Options 101:

1. Pick a stock

2. Pick a direction (up or down)

3. Yolo that shit

4. ?????

5. Profit!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,lol r/options
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You don‚Äôt have faith it‚Äôll go up more ü§£ ok I mostly Likely won‚Äôt yolo but I think I gotta put something in this
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha nice. My question was based on me contemplating whether to get into the spy call game. If you won more than you lost, or if there is a possible method to the madness, i mightve tried myself.

I guess ill stick with boring boomer stocks like defense and tech zzzzzzz. Im into riot and CLF too, lost a good amount on gme b/c of paperhanding LOL"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you sell it already? If not, you do it right tomorrow morning if market goes up. You will struggle if you hold for further profit.

Market is going to pull back from tomorrow onwards."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They expired today it wasnt his choice
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,0.2. Sold at around 2 or so
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This . I am dumb and I followed this
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, that's what I learned from here."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Well duh of course there is a subreddit.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You are talking like you think SPY is a common stock and that is concerning.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,check the expiration date
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs legit. Congrats!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How long were you holding those contracts for ?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that is the missing step 4: be retarded
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,then you did good
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,WSB options are just weekly or 0 date expiration.  Go get em!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah.... I‚Äôm a dumbass I have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My bad ! Thanks !
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,He just said he bought them thursday and obviously they expire today. Are you asking for an hour/minute breakdown of how long he held them?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's in the course prerequisites
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I'm still learning,  got these viac puts waiting to pay out.

Shoulda yoloed that shit"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,SPY is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn‚Äôt see the part when he said he bought them Thursday. I guess my iPhone didn‚Äôt load the entire comment section. Thank you tho :)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry am dumb about options, eli5, didn't he resell them?

He bought Thursday for cheap and then must have sold them for the $2 at some point before they expired today right?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes please
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, you got it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never done that heard you wanna do that (sell) like at least a half hour before market closes so you don't accidentally get assigned, sound about right?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,100 shares of VXX? You could literally light your money on fire and get a better return.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shhhhhhhh don't listen to him, buy weeklies otm with high IV. I sold an 11$ call on amc for 75¬¢ today. 7perfuckingcent premium on a weekly otm option, y'all have big dreams.  

  Edit: ^^theta ^^^gang"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks i get smarter everyday.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this was a hard and scary lesson. You can make a ton of money (Made 90k in weekly rkt) or lose a tone (Lost 80k in a weekly gme) so sometimes it‚Äôs better to just buy the stock. By the time you hear about it on wsb options are a good play for quarter to quarter earnings or some hedging but if a stock goes below your buy price, you still own it and it can come up, if your stock option is below break even you lose the whole shebang!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Saving for later reading
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You said ‚Äúthe phenomenon of high IV for upcoming expiry is the volatility smile.‚Äù This is **incorrect** As you noted elsewhere, the smile is related to strikes. It‚Äôs also known as skew. The smile is higher IV for OTM calls and puts than ITM. 

Also lol tons of people are buying GME. It has one of the most active options chains in the entire market which is crazy for a sub $20B stock. 

If ‚Äúnobody was buying‚Äù IV would be low, as you stated elsewhere IV is a proxy for demand."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,We like the $FEYE 21C 4/9 option
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindME! one month
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but I still think the market is jacked. I got in not too long ago at slightly above pre covid values. Volatility will obviously decay asymptotically, so worst case I just hold it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Could  at least cook a few banana peels with the burning money.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"IV is based on Black Scholes or similar. You can have a low volume and massive spreads, but still crazy high IV. My comment was that IV is increasing near expiry, and the smile shape becomes more extreme. Obviously the smile is related to strike, that‚Äôs literally what it is by definition if you read the plots. It‚Äôs just most extreme at nearer expiry dates, which is the more surprising result. The shape is explicitly determined by strike, that‚Äôs why I plotted it that way lol. Maybe I just need to learn to write better  since that obviously wasn‚Äôt clear."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Based on that option volume thats a lie

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm trying to make it happen

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why so far OTM dude???
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP is fucked imo if he keeps holding, even though some of these are leaps. They're just too far OTM and the very forces and momentum that caused VIACA to sky rocket is now liquidated. 

Archegos went from 200 mil in 2013 to 20 bil before blowing up. When VIACA did their secondary offering, they expected Hwang to partake in 300 mil of the 3 bil stock sale. But the dude was so leveraged that he couldn't scrap together 300 mil and the unwinding started in earnest.

I wouldnt be surprised if this trades flat (or continues to bleed) for quite awhile until actual fundamental catalyst happens. Don't forget this is still up 160% from a year ago."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Credit Suisse is offering a block of 34M shares priced at $41‚Äì42

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is pretty much right. I think there is new value from a year ago with the Paramount+ rebranding and the addition of viacom cable shows and Paramount movies added into it. Then there's the new subscribers that would have given the service a chance after the superbowl media bliz and signing up to see the prince harry/meghan markle interview.

Still though, the company needs some big good news to start seeing an upswing."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Time in the market will always be better than timing it. I held onto APHA through the short report, bad press, not so great financials for years and pressure to sell. At the time I bought at the peak in 2017. Saw my shares go down to $2 and didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself. Family pressure and friends pressuring to sell. Saying that saving is the way and that I was being irresponsible. So I doubled down on every drop I could. 

By November my average share price was now 6.45 instead of 17 or 18 (can‚Äôt remember exactly). Elections roll around (exactly why I was BUYING MORE) and then we saw the results. 3 long years of me constantly looking at losses and feeling like complete shit because I had told people about my investments and of course people will always remind you of your mistakes every time they can (don‚Äôt do what I did be quiet). 

February rolls around and those same friends didn‚Äôt even ask. They knew. They knew I was right then and they know I am right today. There is no better feeling in the world and your day will come young grasshopper. You need to buy more. That‚Äôs it. Is it shares? Not options? Buy more. Is this industry going anywhere else but up? No. I‚Äôm still holding those shares and didn‚Äôt sell at the ‚Äútop‚Äù because that was t the top period. 

I am holding indefinitely because that‚Äôs how you build wealth. Not by hoping In and out of trades because somewhere along the way you‚Äôre gonna probably make a mistake. Few day traders are able to come up with (at peak) +300% return. The likelihood of you being able to do that? Not so likely. Hold your shares. Buy more. Period.

Happy 420 people!!!!

Edit: Check the APHA DD for crying out loud! If that ain‚Äôt good enough, let me know and I‚Äôll try putting a better one together myself!"

Things have to change and considering how Biden and Harris contributed to putting people in jail for a plant during their careers, their silence is unacceptable.

Are you fine with making money while knowing very well other people had their lives completely destroyed?

First, GME makes up less than 10% of my portfolio, so I‚Äôm not super biased, would love for it to print, but don‚Äôt need it to.

They are going to sell 3.5 millions shares, and expect to fetch $1billion for them.  Which works out to $285 per share. Either they know it‚Äôs going up, or already have a buyer who knows it‚Äôs going up."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because it wasn't an offering, they just adjusted their Dec 2020 right to offer (which was 6m shares or 100m dollars) they changed to 3.5m shares or 1billion dollars. ~~Keep in mind that they had the right and ability to sell shares atm at any time since Dec 2020 ie when the stock was at 400+ in Jan and 350 in Mar, yet did not sell a single share~~.

What they did today was ensure they can also make tendies when the real squeeze occurs. 3.5m dilution isn't enough to save the shorts anyways. minimum, there are 15m shorts and that's assuming zero fuckery. That's also, assuming that shorts would even be smart enough to buy the shares and even if they did, they will still need a shitload of shares to cover. Likely, short position is far greater than reported  so 3.5m will make a small dent in the squeeze.

Media tried making this news look bad but it's not. It's GME saying ""we only need the right to sell half as many shares as we previously wanted to, but up to 10x the max price."" They are looking to ride the squeeze with us and I'm down for that."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"well they didn't actually execute the offering yet as far as I'm aware, just basically established a shelf offering allowing them to dilute when they desire to. But then again I don't much attention to GME these days, too much noise there"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They say their max takeaway is 1 billion. Which would put the price at 275ish so I dunno

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"**Also, as I mentioned in my post, here is a $TSLA example on how Wall Street capitalizes on FUD from SEC involvement:**

In the summer of 2019, a ‚Äúhighly regarded‚Äù analyst at Morgan Stanley named Adam Jonas came out with a (pre-split) [worst-case price target of $10 for Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html). This was right around the time Tesla was being looked at by the SEC.

When the news of this broke, one of my friends I roomed with in college told me he made the decision to sell the stock. He was new to the market, and he was worried he was going to lose all of his money on this investment. I‚Äôm sure many other retail investors made the same decision to sell as Wall Street succeeded by inducing fear into $TSLA investors.

**A year and a half later, how much $TSLA does Morgan Stanley own?**

[Morgan Stanley now owns over 3.5 million shares of Tesla which equates to over $2.5 Billion dollars](https://fintel.io/so/us/tsla/morgan-stanley). 

And guess what? That same Morgan Stanley analyst, [Adam Jonas, now has a Wall-Street high price target of $810](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/05/morgan-stanleys-adam-jonas-raises-tesla-price-target-to-a-wall-street-high-of-810.html) (which would equate to over $4,000 before the stock split).

Must be nice ‚Äì lower your price target to scare retail investors, load up on the stock when the price drops, and then increase your price target to drive the stock way up. 

Wall Street does this all the time, and this is the reason we despise these crooks."

I was into Aphria, the pot company, when Hindenburg Research called them a ""shell game"" and released a lengthy report which turned out to be pretty dubious as well. I doubled my position then on the dip after reading their report and was rewarded nicely when the facts came out. I think any shorts report is incredibly self serving and probably skirts on the edge of libel in a lot of cases.

The big difference between LMC and Nikola is these guys actually have a product, they are producing them. As well, having LOI for 100k fleet vehicles means a lot more than the 8 billion in pre-orders Nikola had that you could order on their website without giving ANY information whatsoever. 

Obviously there is a risk, but I think I am going to give these guys a bit more DD and may very well take up a small stake."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If these guys succeed then there are going to be some really pissed off people who didn't get in at $11!

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great work on this DD.

10/10 I'm on this RIDE to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They already retooled the plant and it‚Äôs ready for mass production. Ride is ready to rise!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a project engineer that installs mass production lines for new facilities, I 100% know that their production lines are good to go. They‚Äôll be ready by September, the Betas proved it.


Think logically about why LMC is a great company to invest in, look at all the facts: 
1. They already have a massive production facility
2. 650M cash on hand 
3 GM-Backed company. GM needs them.
4. Current ‚Äúlawsuits‚Äù won‚Äôt have ground to stand on. 
5. They‚Äôre building a f‚Äôing truck for fleets , there‚Äôs so much demand for those. 
6. Actual experienced management team with execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, Honda, etc.
7. Betas are rolling off the assembly lines and being welded by robots
8. New innovative Hub-Motors incorporated into their Vehicles. Tech that other big car manufacturers will want later on but can‚Äôt obtain because LMC already licensed it. This might change how EVs are built, and LMC will be the first ones to do it. 
9. When someone tries to scare you and mentions the ‚Äúunsprung weight‚Äù the motors might add on, tell them to chill because 100% they don‚Äôt even know what that means. There‚Äôs ways around it. You know how much a conventional motor adds to the vehicle ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and how cars are literally engineered around it. Same thing will go with the hub-motors. Actually, the weight distribution will be better in Hub-Motors because all four wheels will have equal weights on them. Your center of gravity will be truly center to the vehicle. 
10. Supply Chain issues are probably going to be solved by GM. 
11. They partnered with Camping World, and collaborated to build an RV for them, that‚Äôs huge. 
12. Their skateboard chassis is interchangeable and can fit any body they put on it with little-to-no modifications. Hence retooling costs will be extremely cheap. Which means you don‚Äôt have to constantly keep changing production line setups."

Hoping to get enough powder before that happens but I'm running out of time.  2,300 of those shares will become long before Steve Burns even has a chance to sell any of his in October.  This stock is an opportunity and value that retail would have never gotten a chance at if Lordstown IPO'd instead.

EDIT:  My average is currently @ $13.07.  My 5 year PT is $200 if they hit 200k/yr in production, but I'll be looking to sell half my shares between 60-$100 within the next 2 years."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Great breakdown! Being new to stocks it's great to have folks with crazy amounts of knowledge. I'm in!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought a bunch of RIDE after reading Hindenburg report and doing some research. 

They are entering their trucks in the San Felipe 250 mid April. Another chance to prove Hindenburg wrong."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Im in with 5.8k shares. Been doing ton of research for the company and a huge short squeeze is inevitable. Its a fucking steal at these prices
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is there any word on some kind of fleet management software suite that would accompany the trucks? 

That could stay as an aftermarket product, but it seems like if you bought a fleet, a centralized place to monitor the status of each truck at least would go a long way."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I haven't done much DD on this.  If they're begining production in the fall, why do analysts have them making a loss in 2022?  I get that the first quarter of 2022 will still be optimization/learning curve, but high estimate of losing 0.52 on the year... when will they make money?

Also, with steel, copper, etc all rising in price, is their $45,000 [edit: $52,500 less EV credit] price fixed, or can they swing it up a bit due to demand/input prices?

Edit: just concerned that they're too aggressively priced.  Pickups are supposed to be a high margin business.  The electric Ford F150 is supposed to debut around $70,000."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"just as an aside, it's pretty weird seeing senators give public opinions on individual stocks"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hear me out here. GM shut down the plant, pushed the union out, and will now soon own this unionless plant!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I would be all in if it werent for the clown CEO and the fabrication of sales numbers
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. In the stock market no one cares about your feel-good hometown story. To me that is just an appeal to emotion, which makes me suspect someone is trying to make some claims in short order that they don't want you to critically think about.
2. Senator Michael Rulli is an Ohio State Senator which means their insight is probably as valid as a cucumber's. As to Tim Ryan, well maybe two cucumbers.
3. Saying Betas are essentially 97% the finished vehicle means next to nothing. Even if it was factually true, that last 3% may be more effort then the first 97% by far. And LMC confirming that production is still on target, well I will believe it when I see it.
4. Using Tesla batteries from LG Chem likely is irrelevant. The vehicle was driving erratic, which leads me to suspect that the whole in-wheel motor design leaves the vehicle prone to driving issues. Perhaps that led to friction or some other thing that caused the fire.
5. The pre-orders... Well the CEO of RIDE made some claims that these were very solid pre-orders. Nothing about paying salespeople to get companies to sign non-binding papers that they will maybe, perhaps, consider buying a Endurance one day. As to ESquared, go look at the details of that company and that pre-order is a joke. Trying to prop this up with what ESquared said, is pretty desperate.
6. The Fleet thing is simply ridiculous. RIDE can target fleets all they want, but your truck has to actually be produced and worthwhile. As to the $45K price target, well I can make a truck with a $25K price target, but if I never produce it, who cares.
7. The San Felipe race should be interesting. As it is essentially a prototype, not sure even if it finishes the race it is relevant in terms of production, but should at least allay some concerns about the technology.
8. The ATVM loan is financing that will help them, but does not fundamentally change the underlying issues with this company.
9. RIDE will never get to successful mass production.

TLRD - RIDE is going to be bankrupt sooner or later. I have PUTS on them."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't someone literally just post a video of the CEO of this dumpster fire standing in front of a green screen and literally refuting himself saying there was a bunch of preorders for their trucks by saying something like ""nobody thought there were sales""? 

Shit seems sketchier than fucking on thin ice."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did not read past the title but wanted to inform that lordstown motors has also been fraudulent in the amount of pre order sales has been sold. They boast that all models are currently spoken for but when we asked the people who had bought said pre orders, many sais they did not plan on following through, but rather pre ordered purely to save their spot in line."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This one is like Nikola‚Äôs little brother
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a scare tactic that the IB's and their research arms have used for years. Goldman and Morgan Stanley are notorious. I worked for some of the largest banks and they use this tactic to build positions and then pump prices.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"With GM, Ford and Ram all looking at putting out electric trucks in the next 24 months not sure I see this start up doing much, other than being acquired if they have have some worthwhile tech.  Ride doesn't have a 15-20 year head start on the big three like Tesla did."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,RIDE is not TSLA @ 2019....not even close.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in construction and everyone has trucks. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY who actually uses a truck for WORK would be caught dead in a cyber truck! This truck looks like a regular truck!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you‚Äôre right on the money
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate it. I was following APHA too when they released the hit piece against them - and I thought the same thing. I should have loaded up on shares after that. 

The real way to make money in this market is to invest in quality companies when there‚Äôs FUD.

Hindenburg loves to stretch the truth and make things seem 10x worse than they actually are. There is a huge difference between Nikola and Lordstown, yet Nikola has over 2X the market cap. Makes no sense."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, literally how every other preorder in history has worked.  Got it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha how are NON-BINDING pre-orders fraudulent?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Take a moment and listen to what you're saying:  that there's no demand for an electric pickup.  That's what was being asserted by Hindenburg.  That there's only 100,000 fake indications of interest but no one would actually buy that thing.  No demand.  That's an idiotic assertion."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"U really think they were trying to trick people? I can‚Äôt tell myself, but if the company does good, will law suits matter?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Except they have a truck that can go uphill rather than coast downhill.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except Nikola is the older brother who ran from home, didnt go to college, and ended up addicted to heroin.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nikola is so far from being compared to lordstown, it proves your just repeating what you heard your wife and her boyfriend talking about, but misunderstood it , because they both bought in today"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that good or bad
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

‚ÄúWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.‚Äù

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean if theyre acquired thatll be a f a t payday. And they are going to have a product faster than anyone else. And itll be GM to buy them. But they just need proof of concept. And with there cash in hand, and assets, easy undervalued and oversold stock"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"One of the biggest challenges for the existing automaker is their relationship with hundreds of suppliers. EV's need less parts, so less suppliers. They cannot realistically ramp production of EV without jeopardizing their relationships with part suppliers who are not happy that they will become obsolete since fewer parts are needed for EV. Announcing an all EV line up 10 years from now is easy but the change is another story. The only way they can do that is by investing in EV start ups and gradually moving into EV. There was an article in Bloomberg a few months ago that had all the data to back this summary."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs worth noting that Lordstown management has been doing R&D into how fleets buy and what type of vehicles they would incorporate into their fleets for 8+ years now. The truck they are putting out is affordable, full-size, and economical. I think targeting fleets out of the gate is genius, and they will have first mover advantage with plans for the first ever all-electric RV in the pipeline."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I am not saying RIDE is the next Tesla or going to have a $600B+ market cap some day. What I am saying, is that the real way to make huge gains in stocks, is to pick winners when there is FUD. Right now, Hindenburg has slandered Lordstown. Bulls like myself will continue to buy, and the bears will continue to short. 

Time will tell who is right and who is wrong. All I know is, Lordstown has the support of Ohio politicians and GM, which I think will help greatly."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Your right.  RIDE is TSLA 2010 right now when it went public @ $17 except Lordstown will achieve production efficiency in half the time - 5 years instead of 10.  Steve Burns looks up to TSLA and is copying/optimizing their business model.  RIDE is in a way better starting position than TSLA was 10 years ago.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go Browns my G... I've been in this for a quick minute. Caught the falling knife pre-earnings but here for long haul. Maybe I'll buy some more in my WeBull acct. 

Can WSB make this thing fly? Let's go."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some argue about the weight being in the wheels instead of being carried all upfront on the chassis.  These people are not automotive engineers, They are gay Bears üåà üêª who buy puts.   They didn‚Äôt understand what they were looking at and repeated something they heard in tech class in 1962."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can divide the weight of a vehicle into 2 categories really easily, the sprung weight that is supported by the suspension and the unsprung weight that isn't supported by the suspension because it literally is the suspension. Unsprung weight includes everything that moves when the suspension does, wheels, tires, brakes, suspension arms, springs and shocks. In automotive design you want all of that to weigh as little as feasible because then it has less momentum and can react very quickly to changes in the road surface like bumps or even just the driver's inputs. This company is putting electric motors in the hubs, the unsprung weight. Electric motors are heavy, I'd be worried about these things slamming into pot holes and speed bumps and breaking while making the rides really uncomfortable while causing the handling to not feel very responsive."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"People can create a narrative with little facts. It‚Äôs legal. 

However, if someone shorts a stock and then releases a report negative about that company, you should be suspicious. 

Think about incentives. It‚Äôs in Hindenburgs best interest for the stock to fail. They didn‚Äôt write the report for the greater good. 

Some of the stuff can‚Äôt be proven false for a while, like production starting in September. We have to wait until September to see if that claim is false. By then, Hindenburg will probably have closed their position and made money."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Third most productive car plant? It was shut down by GM. The transaction was likely in good part helped along by Trump. There are reasons why RIDE was able to get this without having to layout much money. GM probably has a fully secured interest in the plan and when RIDE goes under will get it back.

And as to just say I am shorting it and moving on, tell the people posting overly rosy BS about a company to just say they are bullish on it and move on."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking TENDIES !
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd say Chrysler Fiat would be the most likely to buy them. They are the furthest behind in the electric truck game. Ford and GM are already testing their electric trucks which traditionally would mean fleets they partner with are already using the prototypes.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The big 3 have been doing fleet research and sales for almost a hundred years. They already have the contracts that fill most North American fleets. Ford is all but ready to release an all electric F150 and GM is right on their heals RAM is a couple years out. If I'm running with a fleet and I'm going to electric trucks I'm going with the company that has a dealership network and the technical support I need. This is the biggest issue I see with RIDE. 

Tesla still has a terribly inadequate dealership and service network. It is getting better all the time though."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you are right, but from my own DD, they were involve in some shady dealing with WKHS in the past and I just think they aren't that legit. I just want to say thread safely....."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"When TSLA went public, they have 147 cars sold on the road. So they are not exactly the same in 2010 as well. Maybe closer to 2006 TSLA. Technology have advanced over the years and it's almost given they should be able to produce faster. With the current market, it's also given that RIDE will have a better starting position financially. I don't think there's anything bad once they get a vehicle on the road."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Go Browns! Already counting down the days until next season. Season starts in September and Lordstown will be producing trucks in September. Should be a great month!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Added unsprung weight from hub motors =reduced unsprung weight from axles.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sound pretty bitter.

I did not think there was much value in shorting this (not very confident that the price targets I have will hit) so only opened a small position. I am not losing sleep over this."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"the sidebar of the plant shutting down is not a measure of productivity; the capability is what matters for a company in infancy. That means when they need to scale up they have the capability to do so. It's contradictory to say, 'oh it was shut down' and inferring that it's useless then in the same breath say, 'oh they finagled the deal to re-acquire the plant'. Which one is it? Make up your mind and at least stay consistent."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ford themselves say the all E F150 isn't until Q1 and it starts at 70k aka not a fleet truck. Will be for wealthy landscaping company owners to pull their 300k Contender.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lordstown‚Äôs partnership with Camping World is going to give them access to service and collision centers around the country. It‚Äôs probably one of the smartest partnerships Lordstown could have made. Check this out: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The in-wheel hub motors are unique, F and GM utilize centralized motors with a drive train. The hub motor setup has only 4 moving parts, less expensive to produce and maintain."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate for us uneducated folks?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it‚Äôs worth noting that WKHS has a 10% stake in lordstown."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not bitter.  BULLISH !
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"What are you talking about? Are you parsing words to make points that I never suggested.

The level of productivity that plant had under GM is irrelevant if RIDE cannot get to mass production. If they can successfully get to profitable mass production then great they have the plant to expand production.

That they finagled a deal is what it is. It does not mean much. It can just mean that  GM had a plant that no one was interested in buying for anything close to the cost it was to GM. Tesla bought Fremont at a discount as well. Still took a heck of a lot of work and time to get to mass production, including a decent chunk of time when there were questions about whether Tesla would remain solvent (which depended a lot on shareholder's goodwill as they were diluting the stock significantly to stay alive)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That is a very smart partnership and the RV market may be a great spot for them.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good for you.

FYI, when I first hear of them I thought in-wheel motors sounded really great, but as I looked more into them, I joined the camp that they don't seem to make sense. I have a number of conversations with people about the in-wheel motors and a lot of what I get, boils down to, is they trust Lordstown's claims about them making sense. The issue primarily revolves around unsprung mass issues, which I don't quite understand how you solve, because it seems to be a limitation based in physics (probably less of an issue for driving slowly, say on a work sight, but the moment you pick up speed, it seems to be a critical issue). If they can show that unsprung mass is not an issue here and they can mass produce these, then the company is likely going to do just fine, but I think the onus is on Lordstown to show they can defeat these concerns, not for me to believe them on these incredible claims.

(fyi, I really don't care about the pre-order issue, as making great EV will be enough to sell them regardless of this nonsense. I just don't think they will be successful producing the Endurance)

Like I said, my short position is small so not vested much in this one way or another."

In any case you most likely a payed employee of some shady internet fud firm that pays you ,$15-18 dollars an hour to ,spread crap . You  must be very proud of the work you do .
Congratulations on your success."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"FWIW I'd be more concerned about the ability of the electric motors housing and the motors themselves to take the abuse (specifically vibration) from being unsprung than their unsprung weight, particularly for the kind of environment pickups would be expected to be working in.

It will be interesting to see if it works.

I completely agree with the hometown/local politician portion of your comment. It didn't add anything and of course local politicians are not going to badmouth local job creation."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your response is like the internet version of sticking your fingers in your ear and wiggling your fingers because you don't like what someone is saying.

Whatever. YOLO on this if you like. You will lose your money most likely.

Guess what, whatever I post here will be pretty irrelevant if they can successfully get to mass production in Sep. Apparently they don't need to fundraise now so they have the opportunity to prove themselves. I am just doing a favor for you and providing a contrarian view to the overly optimistic take being provided here by too many."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Who are you referring to?  Original post was made with plenty of DD by an obvious person bullish and long on the stock.

But on a more serious note it might actually dip once people are able to go out and meet people organically, but I'm thinking if that happens, $MTCH is going to be highly resilient, especially if they have a [serious dating vs just fucking] separation. If you want a real significant other but the bars are filled with people just trying to score, the idea of a specifically relationship-oriented dating pool would sound enticing."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The bigger problem is a lot of the big office owners are looking to sublet office space.  Normally that would be a huge upside as new tenants want new office furniture.  But in this case as more people are working productively from home, less office space is needed.  From what I've read, there is a glut of office space on the market, and I wouldn't expect that to change anytime soon.  

Both of those are good companies with good product, I just wouldn't bet on them having a big year of sales for a while."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Please reflair as loss. Not enough equity for a yolo post.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold it. Gold is due for a huge correction. It's the only thing that has gone down the last 9 months while all other commodities have gone up. It's the only thing that should be going up. Most people are so fucking dumb and willfully ignorant that they don't see what's going to happen. The Fed can never raise rates. They can never unload their balance sheet. There will be stimulus after stimulus. The same problems are happening around the world. Every fiat currency is going to die.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Expiration?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mining stocks are relatively cheap and will perform at first instance better than gold. Gold will only perform well when shit hits.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,citadel stacked up on long golds closing out their long held shorts. But gold on paper isn't the same as real gold tho. More paper gold in existence than what has ever existed on earth
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The time to buy gold is when interest rates rising causes everything to crash. That will be the cue for the fed to initiate YCC and drive real rates through the floor. Right now everything is looking rosy and real rates are rising causing gold to go down.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion any stock is a better protection against inflation than gold. Stocks can increase their value and might pay dividends, owning gold costs you quite a lot for storage and doesn't pay you."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,F
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. I actively short gold and watched its $11trn+ market cap drop to $10trn.

Now watching its barely $10trn market cap dwindle towards $9trn.

Demand is the primary factor necessitating value.

Watched gold shit the bed in the worst economic environment in over 10yrs. We crashed and the ‚Äúhedge‚Äù that most analysts saw hitting $2500+/oz... shat the bed.

Bond analysts‚Äîthe most conservative of the conservative and some of the more intelligent‚Äîstarted speaking openly about lessening the gold exposure in portfolios a few weeks ago on norm-o low-grade finance TV.

$IAU puts. 1/2023. This is the way.

Who wants gold anymore? It doesn‚Äôt work as a hedge and we‚Äôre entering a booming recovery and re-opening when no one wants hedges anyway... let alone a dysfunctional one that‚Äôs bleeding market cap like someone slit its wrists. It‚Äôs still walking away... should fall down dead by 1/2023 expiry. I like the $IAU $15p, but have varied puts up and down the chain.

OP, if you want a great miner that just had the gold part of its valuation beat out of it and has just consolidated a bit, check out $FCX

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I agree it was pretty much a swing trade with the knowledge that the market would respond to stimulus checks and reopening of stores and the economy. Also I knew that they took way too harsh of a beating with mediocre earnings overall. Felt rather confident just wish I bought more of those 330 calls. I do believe that COST will push to all time highs by september and then trade sideways between 375-425 until a superb earnings comes out to push them over 200B dollar market cap
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Your brain is so smooth it almost shines
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing you're still young and have lots of time to make more money. Just don't do this when you are 40.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the most underwhelming and overhyped stock I've ever added to my portfolio. Def not buying anymore calls on it. Its almost as if they are trying really hard to keep it low.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You are 21 not 61. You have time to correct it.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I own a lot of shares. Everything at an ATH and this turd just keeps going down on green days. I m patient

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've got a few grand tied up in shares. Since they don't expire, I'm not super worried. Unfortunately for you, there really aren't any catalysts between now and the 16th to move the stock. If anything, institutions that hedged their positions with calls have a strong interest in keeping the price under $9 until after the 16th."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am right there with you on some UWMC Calls.

You bought way to many contracts in my opinion too.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll buy them at .02
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,should have played it safe and bought the stock...the stock will go up eventually...probably June-july-ish
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mightve sold one of those to you

Sucks and I'm sorry for your loss. I'm stuck holding the stock for now and the premium didn't cover this downturn.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yes buddy, you belong here. Why would you even think of risking your life savings? Why don‚Äôt you just buy the shares? I have 505 shares at an average price of $8.30. This sh goes up and down but I know my shares won‚Äôt expire, save those short calls for a more volatile stock. $UWMC will skyrocket when earnings are announce, trust me, soon $UWMC will also be added to the Russell Index which will surely add more value to it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll buy them
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt get why so many are playing this stock.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"for real, I played options before and didn't profit in only one call (out of like ten tries) so I guess I just felt a reversal was inevitable or at least a loss this massive 2 weeks before expiry wasn't in the picture. I wasn't really considering the possible risks because of the past success I had smh"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,$5400 is hardly free.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,3800 shares here lol (down 4-5K).. I am accepting all the Red and Will embrace It! At least i made +$705 day trading today
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"agreed, wish I would've went with shares too. at this point I'm just hoping for a a small spike to get at least a tiny chunk of what I lost back"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree I bought too many contracts. I had bought 40 the week before it was supposed to get included into Russell and them averaged down from there after that because I didn't think it'd bleed this bad
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"agreed but I still feel this company is a solid investment right now its not looking good. I know price targets don't hold too much weight but I haven't seen one that's in the 7s. Plus they make a lot of money. I shouldve sold right after news of it not getting included in the Russell indexes but the stock didn't take too much of a hit so I held assuming a recovery was likely. My biggest mistake was watching my money bleed out like this and not having an exit strategy, in my opinion"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,As far as I can tell there seems to be a direct correlation between tons of graphs and shitty DD
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,i mean a lot of it had came from trading stocks/options and I had 15k in my account at one point from 1k

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,At least wait until tomorrow for the possible slight DRIP spike
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your biggest problem was yoloing into calls without capital to back it up. 

You needed to buy shares and sell the calls. 

You'd still be down 10% depending on entry date, but it's safer money with far less risk. 

Start looking into wheeling and get a bigboi account on a real brokerage to sell some Poor Mans Covered Calls to recover. 

Slow and steady until you have a good base of assets. Then you can do some yoloing."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Check out r/thetagang for this kind of strategy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah all this is true as well, I wouldn't really call it a complete yolo because I didn't buy that much at once. I averaged down a bunch a week or so ago because I thought it had bottomed out and would recover a little so I could get some back but it just kept bleeding. Regardless it was money I didn't have to lose though. Thanks for the insight. Definitely chilling out on the calls now its a shame I had to learn a lesson on options and margin the hard way lol"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"A story of love not found:

Two apes, both living in separate oceans in their respective marine mammalian whale-like state, each looked out upon the watery landscape.  Each of them was searching for tendies but each saw the landscape before them quite differently. For one was summing near the surface and felt the only way to go was down. The other had been swimming at the bottom of the ocean and was quite certain things would have to go up. Both apes, with tendies in their hearts and diamonds in their mutant little ape fins swam about in the ebbing tides as they listened for the soothing sounds of other distant sea-gorillas.  Only time would tell if the two would find the tendies. Or perhaps they would meet and make beautiful sea monkeys. Or perhaps they would stray too close to a Japanese fishing boat and lose it all.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed with you. That is what looks like is going on here. I think it may be playing a part in price stabilization as well (large deep ITM call options causing market makers to hedge). Maybe someone is trying to bleed OTM option holders?

We're trying to keep discussion substantive and market related, which is why purely political discussion, with no relation to the financial markets, is not allowed. ([Rule 5](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules))

Now that this thread has reached r/all, we're seeing a LOT of purely political comments, calls to activism, country / party bashing, etc.

It's great that you guys want to talk about that, but WSB isn't the place. We're here to take big bets, lose a lot of money, post loss porn, cry to our therapists, pick up a second job at Wendy's... uhh, where was I going with this...

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They side step this by having the account in their spouses name.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which one do I YOLO, Senate or the House?

Which is more corrupt, more insider trading?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone please analyse all their trades, investigate the companies and cross reference them with potential mutual interests with the representative‚Äôs voting history, and then give me a succinct summary of what this means? Thanks"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I'm just curious, how does this work? 

Also, somebody give this man the world's largest penis award"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is awesome. I wonder if using PDF exclusively is quietly a secret way of trying to make this sort of task more difficult ü§î
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good job on this! It‚Äôll be interesting to watch Pelosi, because her and her husband have made EXTREMELY suspicious trades"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, this is amazing work. Great insight and very nicely presented.

Are you doing this out of mere curiosity? Or are you a company?

Either way, great job. I hope the word spreads about this."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent, thx! 

What'd be great is to have the data that shows any bills introduced or passed related to each stock trade...you know....to point out the hardcore benefits of legalized insider trading that Congressional trash legalized for themselves, and which piece of shit is making themselves bank on the backs of others.  i.e.  Pelosi dumping 1m into Tesla...the day before the bill that forces FedGov to move to all electric vehicles in the coming years came to the floor."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you thought of adding features that would put a Democrat or Republican tag to the senator names and allowing you view to aggregate buying and selling by democrat and republican?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You are the smartest ape! I shall follow you when the uprising take over
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So just make the same trades they do, sit back, profit"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"US Politicians all corrupt, more news at 11"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Follow Pelosi.  When she starts investing in Defense you know we are getting into another war.

Defense btw... Not ""Depends"" that's bidens."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I appreciate all the work you put into this
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is an awesome tool for me to show my co-workers. Some of them legit think that politicians do not trade, because they are officials and can't do that......Like huh????"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Suggestion: post somewhere on the site your monthly costs to stimulate peeps to donate to help cover them
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I only count 66 senators in the Senator Metrics dropdown list.  Does that mean the other 34 didn't make trades?  I could be good to include all 100 and just put 0 trades for the ones that didn't make any.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why don‚Äôt they say what stock is being bought and sold?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you posted this at /r/DataHoarder? Seems up their alley.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So if I just follow this I should be rich then right?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"My understanding is that members of congress are required to report their stock trading activity, but not their options activity (unless their options activity leads to them exercising, and therefore owning / buying shares).

Can someone confirm?  If this is true, that's a loophole the size of Jupiter."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Doing god's work here.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is cool, though I am curious as to why you have to hand-transcribe the reports. There's a ton of libraries out there for doing OCR from PDFs. Are they not a consistent format or something?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't have a wife, but when I do, I shall introduce you"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Shocking that there are democrats in congress buying oil stocks. So much for caring about the Earth. Also lol some bought GME

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! I was thinking an ETF based on what our elected officials are buying and selling would be a good idea.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Does this only count stocks traded by the members of the Congress but not companies/trusts they control?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You da real MVG. Most Valuable Gorilla!

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for putting this together. It has always bothered me that Congress can essentially do insider trading legally üò° just curious, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to get how their spouses are investing, would you?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is great. What would be really cool is if you compared their rate of returns to the market/ to hedge funds to see if congress as a whole happens to have more info than us. Also, just display the top performing reps YOY."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"YES! I love this.  I always thought that house and senate members should publish their intended trades 3-4 days prior to their inventment managers submitting their intended trades.....to help the apes around here get rich like they do. Would be nice the follow the very successful senate/house traders and copy their every move but before they actually get a chance to conduct their trades. If they have insider info, everyone needs to have that info before they can act on it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried to see Rick Scott's picks on your senate one, and it shows up blank. What's up with that?"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, if these run long enough we'll be able to track it the Senate beats the House or not"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What's the over/under on how long until they change something to make it impossible to track it with this tool and force you to either make another? Or just eliminate the reporting altogether...

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Currently, no there is no filter for that. The subholding co is not transcribed right now. Typically though those with Blind trusts simply make no trades. So a list of who uses the blind trusts would be easier to filter out of the CSV."

There are some clean ones, but they always cost $$ or their accuracy leaves a lot of be desired. There is no smart page breaking or anything when they file so you can have an otherwise clean PDF have a transaction cut into two pieces.

Ive experimented with it, but didnt have much success aside from a very expensive paid tool free trial"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,u up?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not about that. It‚Äôs about them having insider information

- Trades in trusts they manage
- Direct spousal trades
- Trades from direct dependents (children)"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish that the data was that real time. Would almost be like front-running trades that certain apps do for commission free trading. Unfortunately they are allowed a 45 day window to disclose.

At least there is some level of access at all for the public"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,House has data all the way back to 2008!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,There was talk of just having congress not being able to trade - im sure that isnt going anywhere soon. Repeal of Stock act would be bad PR. Im sure they will try to hamfist it into something else like with SOPA
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Its okay to just absorb the information. I have done about 800 transactions myself!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Youre right, it should and will say that soon!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"average is about 20-25 days. Limit is 45 days or else a minor fine is charged. Definitely not real time, but certainly less than 60"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not seeing certain names of long time career politicians even having a single trade makes me feel like it's even dirtier. We know for sure Mitt Romney trades right? But he doesn't seem to be anywhere in this.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This! This could probably be more-or-less automated too. E.g. analysis of sectors affected by different legislation compared to stock trades executed around the time the legislation was introduced and voted on. That could be some seriously scandalous info to make easily digestible by people.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oil's also very interesting right now.

There are only 3 certainties in life.

Death, taxes and government policy's effect on asset prices.

Oil price is the most obvious example in recent years. The Saudi and Russian governments went to war on market share by flooding the Oil market back in March 20, and for a brief moment in time in April Oil futures went negative. Then the Saudi and Russian governments suddenly agreed to cut supply (gee what could have possibly caused that), and on the days that followed the best 100% odds of winning trade of the decade was born. 

And now, in the last few days, the White House demanded that the Saudis increase supply to stop the price of oil from rising any further. That resistance zone at 70 is now backed up by a couple of US carrier fleets. It's a case of ""sell us your oil or we kill you, but sell us too much and we also kill you."" Or in other words, business as usual.

And they call us apes. O wait, we call ourselves apes.

TL/DR: This isn't financial advice, more the mad ramblings of a semi-retarded, bare assed baboon, but you could say it's not the worst time to be shorting Oil futures right about now. The $50-70 a barrel range seems to be where it's at. Then when the FUD hits and Oil price bounces off the $50 support zone, yolo into Oil stocks!"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perception is everything though, these fucks know about things coming down the pipe before anyone else. If they know another Senator/Congressperson is about to announce a bill they've been working on that's likely to influence the stock price of some company or industry, they can make trades in advance of that and avoid a downturn or get in before the upturn. It doesn't matter if the legislation takes months to pass, the market will price in the potential effects of that bill immediately.

Look at the Evergreen bullshit, the boat wasn't even stuck 24 hours and the market was freaking out before any ACTUAL effects were being felt."

The STOCK act was passed to combat the insider trading in congress, as a [direct response to a 60 minutes report that explicitly mentions](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/11/hustle-defuse-60-minutes-congressional-insider-trading-story/335497/) Nancy Pelosi (D) Spencer Bachus (R) [Dick Durbin](https://web.archive.org/web/20080920014104/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087) (R), and John Boehner (R) in relations to trades they made before the 2008 housing collapse. For what its worth, Boehner Durbin and Bachus look far worse in this specific scenario, but regardless

putting us at D(1) and R(3).

this was left an unshaken pot [as far as i can see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading#By_members_of_Congress), until [2020 of course where we had a new scandal related to covid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal). In that senators David Perdue (R), Kelly Loeffler (R), John Hoeven (R), Richard Burr (R), Jim Inhofe (R) and Dianne Feinstein (D) were all implicated in this insider trading. as well as Greg Gianforte(R), a governor but candidate at the time.

Giving us a total tally of 

**D(2) and R(9)**. 

Which, I would personally consider statistically relevant."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,the ones you really need to look out for are the people who made moves before the boat even got stuck.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So it is useful
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I really appreciate you asking though. I built it in this smooth brained way because I dont want to be gouged for server costs on AWS. S3 is cheap and widely available so i figured no one would mind!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This was done with members of both parties.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh right i remember this, a bunch of crooks. is that the only data point though?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Which, I would personally consider statistically relevant.

Fortunately we have actual math to tell is whether or not this is truly statistically relevant.

So given 11 insider trading senators, how significant is it that 9 of these 11 are republican?

If we assume the senate is about 50/50 D/R (close enough, even if it leaned 60/40 in either direction the numbers would basically be the same). We'll say there are 50 Ds and 50 Rs.

Pulling 11 Ss from this pool completely randomly yields a 3.27% chance of 9 of them being R.

A sample size of 11 (out of 100) gives us a confidence level of 70% and a margin of error of 15% [source](https://www.calculator.net/sample-size-calculator.html?type=1&cl=70&ci=15&pp=50&ps=100&x=45&y=2).

I do not even need to check the p-table to tell you that this will yield a p-score far above 0.05, thus letting us say this is clearly not statistically significant."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would be interesting to see these politicians history of buys and sells and see if there is any large correlation between stock price movement and their respective trades. It would also be cool to see which senator has the highest correlation between entering/exiting a trade and the stock price after each action. That way we would know who is either a genius, or more likely, who is the most corrupt fucker and benefit from it."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs others around 2008. You‚Äôd honestly have to analyze the data yourself to find a correlation between officials actions and the respective stock gain/loss to truly see who is more corrupt.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That isnt the scope that was being questioned though, the user was questioning if there is difference **in regard to insider trading**, which means your total pool is 11, not 100."

Biggest gainers so far will be the biggest losers when a correction happens (except GME, the negative beta unicorn lol!). So, yeah, it‚Äôs risky. 

At the same time, Biden wants to build a national network of EV chargers so that could be enormous for Tesla if they get some kind of crazy contract. 

I‚Äôm still not convinced EV battery tech has advanced enough to start building a national network. No one wants to stop for 1-2 hours to charge their car every 250-300mi. Road trips in EVs must suck ass."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"true, that $2 could‚Äôve gone to rittos lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"A week ago I took a road trip from Seattle WA to Santa Cruz CA in my model 3 in one day.

I spent 2 hours charging in total for 900 miles of travel. I probably charged 20% longer than I needed to for getting to my next stop with plenty of charge, I just plugged in at the super charger, got food or drink at a Starbucks or Target or Fred Meyers or Safeway in the same lot and stretched my legs. 

The driving itself was way less fatiguing since autopilot takes a surprising amount of cognitive load off. I have done that trip before in an ICE car and it was absolute ass. I felt fucked up after that long of a drive, even if I saved an hour of ‚Äúfueling‚Äù. I still had to stop at rest stops or other bathroom areas. 

I literally just typed in my end destination and never had to think about where to stop, it routed me to super chargers along the way. I was not once concerned about how much charge I would have at each stop. It‚Äôs still getting better as Tesla continues to ramp up their super charger production."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,1-2 hours? the electric hummer has like a 10 minute charge time for 100 miles.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought Tesla made most of its money from selling EV credits to other car manufacturers ü§£

The battery swapping sounds like a better solution then the current king ass charging times though. 

I‚Äôm not investing in Tesla (short or long!) but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt hope they aren‚Äôt successful‚Äîwe need a real green revolution and EVs will be a huge part of that. Solar roofs, sharing IP and building out clean energy infrastructure, ALL GOOD."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has been my experience in a standard range M3 -- AP makes the drive much less tiring, and I really don't mind the charge times. Sometimes I end up charging longer than I really need to just b/c I'm watching something on Netflix or enjoying the out-of-the-car-stretching-my-legs time. It definitely takes \*longer\* to go from A->B when stopping to charge and EV than if driving an ICE car, but for me, doing a few (< 6) trips of < 1000 miles each/year, I don't mind the tradeoff."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve driven my Model 3 all over California during the past year. I usually just go on random weekend drives and sleep in my car. Charging has never been an issue and sometimes it charges too fast and I have to move my car before I‚Äôm done exploring the area. The thing about super chargers is that a lot of them are in really cool spots that are worth exploring for a little bit, way better than a gas station break, usually way better food options and scenery. 

I have the $35,000 model so I‚Äôve only got around 210 miles of range and even with that smaller battery I‚Äôve never even gotten close to having any concerns about range and I‚Äôve driven to some pretty remote areas. 

Car batteries aren‚Äôt like phone batteries, they don‚Äôt just all of a sudden drop from 20% to 5% and I think that experience is what really scares people."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Honest question from a pleb. Aren't you afraid of the auto pilot? I'm just terrified to trust even the shit that breaks for me...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In a world where the # of batteries available is the limiting factor to the number of EVs which can be produced, spending extra batteries on packs which sit around waiting for a user is a bad idea. 

What we need:

* Charge at home available for apartment dwellers
* Fast charge density so you can make it from spot to spot charging 5-60% on road trips
   * It's because the charge rate slows down the higher SoC of your pack
   * Even if you only go \~210 miles at 70mph that's 3 hours. Time for a piss and a stretch.
* Structural packs which make the vehicle lighter and increase the overall kwh / kg leading to better range.
   * Packs that are swappable aren't going to be load bearing. You'll just have to carry them around like cargo.
* Fast chargers with good walking-distance amenities.
   * Plug in 1st, walk and use the restroom. Grab a fast food and coffee. By the time you're walked back to your car \~15 min later you should already have a good bit of charge done.

&#x200B;

It's why I'm shelling out the \~70k for the 500 mile range CT. The speed and huge towing is nice but all I really care about is the range. It means I can go farther without stopping. It means I can put kw's into the pack at a higher rate for longer before the charge rate slows down. It means I end up with fewer total cycles on the pack per miles driven."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you want that last 10% to go from 90 to 100% then the 100kwh pack of the S can be done in 1h20m at a fast charge.

But if all you NEED is 80% of a 400 mile range then you're done in \~40 min. If you only need another 200 miles from a 400 range, or 50% then you're done in \~20 min or less."

But the advanced safety features took over for me a month ago when I was changing lanes and some asshole sped up and got in my blind spot when I was turning, the safety features started beeping and the car pushed itself back into the lane I was originally in. 

In general I think it‚Äôs just hard not being in control, even if it‚Äôs another human driving your car it‚Äôs gonna be stressful. But at the end of the day, when FSD is at level 5, I‚Äôll trust it over any human. Look at how bad human drivers are on a daily basis, the car just has more eyes and can ‚Äúthink‚Äù about a situation faster than any human so it‚Äôs honestly easier to trust a robot."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 50x may $35 calls. They're doing very well. Everything is primed for lift off, the only scary thing is insider lock up expired last week. At any moment insiders could dump shares. I expect they're smart though and they know the stock could short squeeze and they're waiting for that."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought RKT was done and did not buy it a few bucks up because it had 1.98 billion shares outstanding only to see it skyrocket.  RKT had a good beat quarter like ASO and high short interest.  ASO had a great beat and 91 million shares outstanding.  ASO can go up quickly and stay up longer
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Got 6 4/16 $35 calls and 1 $40 call at open this morning. Let's FUCKING go boys!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,ASO is the way.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Strap in retards, I‚Äôm really thinking this will go like RKT"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,High si but low utilization and cost to borrow. Worth some lottos but not yolo
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In at $16, keep on rolling baby!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I set a limit buy for the am. What the hell. GME is being boring.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd like to get in on this, but it feels like fomo chasing at this point."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe I‚Äôll yolo this tomorrow. What do y‚Äôall think?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because I missed the boat up, I will be waiting with my dirty fd puts on the way down"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I got 140 shares this morning. Feeling frisky
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just went in at $32 even though I‚Äôve liked aso for months 

I had other plays that were running but if I know anything follow Reddit momentum this will gamma there‚Äôs way too many apes unless they pull a gme and take it off exchanges"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this stockü¶ç
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally some decent technical analysis as compared to fucking cup and handles shit.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stoch showed It already started squeezing last week no? 

Days to cover ~ 6.. today, maybe tomorrow last day..

Weirdly small squeeze for such a high short interest but
I went in and out today for 1.5üçå Profit / share"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,what app is this.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was going to buy some calls in the morning but my bank delayed my wire transfer so I didn‚Äôt go through. At this point it‚Äôs too far gone, super pissed"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to short this bitch
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yay for crayons!!!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone think this will squeeze soon?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but they sell AR-15s and I‚Äôm not an ass hole so
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,moon brother
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,shares?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"i wouldnt call it too late.   i'm ngl though, i didnt expect it to break 30 this soon."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too late, their stores are always fucking packed lol and they keep beating earnings"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh god haha yep what did I say. Luckily I got out with only a $4 loss. Beware of the FOMO, kids!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the expiration?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good point lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I always thought like this... and every single time the stock continued up lmao then I get fomo sad
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could tank, could moon. Who knows!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm excited to see this age poorly.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats what they said at 28
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Forreal, why do I not see these until it's already at or near peak, how do I filter through all the shitposts to find these gems and go +300% ?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It looks like a decent play until you realize they have significant debt, they source most of their stuff from China so they get boned if Biden decides to fight a trade war, they have virtually no online presence, and there's a debt-free competitor with better multiples called BGFV."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree 100%. I was in aso at 24-27. 
Not gonna fomo and baghold 
But as ppl said everything can happen, what if it reaches 40?

I'm not risking it for other plays I believe will get more upside and I got in ""early"""
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I just did right before close. I think it‚Äôs a good one not only because of the short interest but because they‚Äôre a good company that keeps beating earnings and people are going to be going in person to stores more later this year. I‚Äôve been going there for years and it‚Äôs usually packed lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I‚Äôve been wondering how much squeeze is left myself. At the same time, they hit earnings out of the park and prior to the earnings release, average volume was only 1.5 million. So while a portion of the increased volume was probably due to shorts covering, a portion was also due to other investors jumping on board. 

Even if we assume half of the increased volume since the ER was due to shorts covering, that would still leave about 50% of the original short interest to go."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Tradingview
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It only went up 14% today

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shorts are 39% according to Market Beat. Some are saying 45%, the numbers should be coming out within the hour so we'll see. According to some that's anywhere between 3-6% more than was last reported 3/15. They got until next week to deal with that. Its looking good."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"ASO has been discussed for a while but you unfortunately have to wade through 1000 ""just FOMOd my life savings ($300) into GME. To the moon! ü¶ç"" posts. 

This seems like a decent stock but I agree that we're probably chasing at this point so I'm just gonna sit out for now."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I felt the same way the day I bought my rkt calls.  Next day was that vertical line you see.  Could go vertical the other way or even go vertical sideways though!  Goodluck.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not just cuz of gme posts. Most ppl here are gme hardcore fanatics and shit on any posts that are not gme or AMC or other meme stock. Nothing against gme or anything but theres money to be made elsewhere too.
Not a financial advice but you still have viac. Basically any call expiring after 4/16 within he $45-$60 range is looking promising. Lots of good DD here too. Look into it.
I is a retard stupid idiot who likes gambling and this is not a financial advice"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Filter by DD and most recent. You can find some ASO posts from last week when calls were way cheap.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you think price will be driven way down with short attacks or squeeze sometime this week?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,i too bought at ATH at one point. we‚Äôll see
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§Æ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit it tanked by $.25 everybody get out
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,? As soon as I bought in it tanked. As predicted

I was missing these steps, tyvm"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I have some 30c that are doing nice and I talked myself out of buying 35c this morning.  You can omit posts that contain gme from search results if you weren't aware btw!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,All the GME posts are getting annoying as fuck. I somehow found ASO last week and loaded up on calls last minute Thursday
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can the regular Reddit app not [filter by keyword](https://i.imgur.com/zV1T1LT.jpg)? I hopped out of GME last week and this has saved so much headache not having to wade through the posts
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was extremely close to pulling the trigger on RKT at $24.50... lesson learned.

Edit: 24.5 on the way UP not after it came back down lol....Important distinction."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Funny you bring that up, I was watching DISCA and VIAC because of the non-GME excellent DD on Hwang and Archegos. Who the fuck buys DISCB? Only that one guy. I just want to be that guy for once."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm seeing this now in hindsight, another person commented with this suggestion and I gave my last award away, so here you go bud: ü•á"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao. It went down $2 and has already regained .50c. Patience my fellow ape. Patience.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You in the wrong game! Lol I had bought 30 strike 4/16 calls about a month ago for 260 I saw them go all the way down to 40 bucks and still holding they just closed at 3.55 a piece
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's the tricky thing. This does feel a little like RKT with today's price action. The thing that stops me from buying calls is that the squeeze is already being priced into them, imo. Idk. I don't really have any dry powder to throw at this. I may have entered if I did."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape help Ape
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah the IV shot up 150%-200 from last week.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly I‚Äôll just take the risk especially with all the chatter and the fundamentally good company too it just seems primed for takeoff this week
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The fundamentally good company is the most important part imo every time I go in there it‚Äôs packed and their clothes are fucking expensive lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"hey, i sold you one of those :)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"A new squeeze emerges. $ASO üöÄ 

Honestly think this could go to $45 ~~this~~ by next week. It sounds ridiculous but 40% short interest and low average volume means this is a recipe for some serious moon juice."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I had one 35c 4.16 and should have bought them all last week when they were sitting at .18.  Fuck me."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn man
Congrats for believing ! 
Enjoy your profits"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Take some profit retard
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So you invested 991 in it correct? I‚Äôm trying to learn calls right now and it seems it‚Äôs can be worth it. Placed a call at 40 for the 16th. Hopefully it pays out nice before my bday the next day lmao
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,God I wish I understood calls

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I never understand these screenshots. What does Current price mean and average cost? I assuming +50 amount is 50 contracts?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"this might be stupid question. Sorry for that i am new to this and would like to understand these options.
How can this $40 call be in profit (with premium $40,2) if the highest it went was around $32 ? If this is stupid or beginner question. Sorry guys"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucked up because I am  new ape and thought you could buy options after hours...which is what I tried to do last Thursday about 5 o\`clock....woke up this morning to realize my mistake. So instead of buy 5- 35c 4/16 at 0.60 I managed to only grab 2-35c at 2.60....im big sad currently. TIme to double down on 45c I guess
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is Bad 

Hier a ü§ß"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My condolences üò¨
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Higher than that... green market euphoria on top of this üòé
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"ASO is actually a really good company with a low valuation. I got into it long at 23-25 mostly to sell calls against. I figured it wouldn‚Äôt go down much. And ever since they reported earnings last week it‚Äôs been a rocket ship. Could easily see them at $40-$50 by year end. Would still be a multiple in-line with Dick‚Äôs at that price. 

I think it flies under a lot of people‚Äôs radar since it‚Äôs a relatively low market cap and not in any index funds. 

Been taking profits but still have a small long position. Now I‚Äôm trapped since my long is offset by a now in the money call I sold...just waiting til expiration to unwind.."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"we will see buddy, thanks!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did retard. took out $30k profit. Still bullish and holding dozens of $30 and $35 calls.

Only grabbed this screenshot, didn‚Äôt screenshot everything I had lol.

Learned my lesson at this point to always take SOME profit, especially when IV spikes."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here you go, some proof of profits taken. I‚Äôm still holding most of my call positions, this is going to $40-45.

https://i.imgur.com/Slutzoy.jpg"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That far out of the money with less than 2 weeks until exp is a lottery ticket which is perfect for here but also should not be used to gauge the effectiveness of calls.  


If you want to really use call options right buy a TSLA call for $100 out of the money expiring this Friday. That is how it is truly done."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You don‚Äôt have to to participate in options trading on this forum
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME and ASO are still the plays for me! Both looking super juicy for the next couple of weeks!

ASO price still catching up to its actual value (based on latest earnings), so this is especially dangerous for the shorts. Have a feeling shorts are super panicked with ASO right now and the first ones to cover will minimize losses. Have a feeling there is going to be a mad dash by shorts to start covering before gamma starts getting wilder. 

GME technicals looking SUPER BULLISH, price bounced right back to $190 today after the announcements this morning (SUPER SUPER BULLISH to have this rebound despite announcing share sale), and shareholder meeting should be announced end of this week or beginning of next week. All around bullish GME."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In case others have the same question:

Current price refers to the price of the option during that period of time. So the option in the screenshot is worth $2.03 AKA $203. 

Average cost is the average amount a person paid for a contract/contracts. The dude paid $20 bucks for a single contract. You're right on the money about the +50 meaning 50 contracts."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Call options don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúin the money‚Äù to be profitable. ‚ÄúImplied Volatility‚Äù impacts the value of the option.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,how can he be in profit ? if its $40 call and price of the stock on printscreen show $30.67? . Shouldnt he be in profit above $40.2 ?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you mean the strike price $2.03? ASO was never $2.03?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean market orders are fine if liquidity is super high. If OI isn't huge then yeah always Limit Orders
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The more you know.....
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,On Thursday last week before the long weekend.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not exactly, the breakeven point (in your case ""he be in profit"") only matters when someone is holding the contract until the day it expires. I don't understand this entirely, but if there's a change in price of a stock, the stock price change affects options way out of money and that can cause it to change in value.

For example, let's say the 40 dollar call was worth 0.10 ($10), this call expires in May and the current price of the stock is about $28. If the price of the stock suddenly jumps to $30 dollars, the $40 option (while massively out of the money) might move up in price to like 0.30 ($30). Why? My understand is the increasing possibility of the contract being ITM. So someone would be in profit if they purchased an option at a lower price that gained in value.


However, the ""breakeven"" point of the option is about $40.10. This is the stock price at the contract (40.00) and the premium paid (the option contract price that was purchased, in this example it's 0.10 or $10). This only matters if you're holding the option until expiry. Most people do not hold options that gain in value until expiry because the option will slowly lose it's value over time, aka theta."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly as the person below you said,The Call option doesn‚Äôt exactly need to be ITM to make money, Imagine you buy a 40 C Weeklies last week before the run up,The chances of that 40C being ITM before expiration is quite low, 
Now the Stock jumps up over 30 ,Now what do you think will happen to the 40C Weeklies? They go up in price as the underlying has moved significantly ,However Theta eats up the calls significantly if it trades sideways tomorrow so the best bet will be to take profits especially after such a run up in weeklies"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"no its the cost of the option... aka ""premium"" paid for the right to buy ASO at the strike price by the given date"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I said price of the option."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats premium of the option not the stock price.2.03 premium means you pay 2.03*100=203 for a call option

2021-04-05 18:48:54,wallstreetbets,Hindsight... shouldve bought the $160 dip at today's opening. ADVANCE YOU APES. 
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought that dip. ALWAYS BUY THE DIP.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I YOLOd the dip, nearly 200 shares a few cents above the bottom.

Feels good after buying the peak dozens of times."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey there you are, I left you a voice mail letting you know your vehicle warranty is about to expire , please call me back"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The volume has gotten so low, I can barely hear it trading."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't need hindsight to know you should get out of Robinhood while you can. Every transaction you make you're wasting money.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No dip enough... I need it under 150
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have bought when it was like $40 üò≠ good luck apes
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought more at $160.70 got lucky
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I did üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember!

If the current price is below your DCA, you‚Äôre in the dip!!

But also, just buy anyways because this shit is going to the moon."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip - or BE the dip.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If brokers were food, RH is a nice warm bowl of diarrhea."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I won't be buying anymore unless it's below my average. Still holding though
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought a call on the dip and regret not taking a loan to buy 10 instead of 1
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Transfer off of Robinhood!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip again baby.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The FUD holy hel
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Even if im averaging up?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I still got some dip left from $112
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The dip this morning was tasty af. Apes ate that shit up quickly.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Thought it would drop more. Kinda sad it didn‚Äôt
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Expect more dips as the hedgies try to build capital before the squeeze.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I was hoping the 10am dip was going to be better so I missed the good one. I bought anyways.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Were you dumb enough to wake up at 4am PST, because you had a feeling GME would drop pre-market? 

Then set your buy order for $158 just after it passed never to see it again... spending the entire pre-market thinking you could change it, but maybe it will go lower after open. So, you leave it at $158. 

Super sad face. :("
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,U should be already out of RH lol your tendies gonna be byebye
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holding GME and buying spy poots.

Awww you‚Äôre so confused it‚Äôs cute"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Should be back up!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lost like 5K on SPY Puts from Thursday, yeeted on GME called when the price was $177, sold when it hit back to $183 for a nice $3k. Getting closer to being even again :)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You kids are so fucking dumb
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§¶
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao you gotta be dumb as hell to be losing this much money to GME. Shit was $40 just a month ago or so lmao
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have had hindsight
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ooof! üöÄ

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro you have a notification from Taco Bell. Should check it, may be important."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip and averaged down
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I got no money left. Wish I could buy more though!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How long do you have to have owned a stock to earn dividends on it?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Which broker this is?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,same i was waiting for 150 but it never dipped that low
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs never just the dip
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you have tendies and are an ape, there is no other way but to buy the dip.

definition of dip-----what happened this morning."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Tfw banking app can't recognise fingerprint and miss the dip because can't top up account üò¢
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, first time this ape felt strong."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm so confused. 
If this is a joke.
/rwoosh"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good ape ü¶ç
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I just bought premarket. As soon as I learned what actually caused the dip I couldn‚Äôt control myself.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I woke up 0420 CDT, watched the drop to 160, did not consider 100 more shares and thought. This will trigger all the limit order at opening and bring it back up to less anxiety triggering levels. 

I disappointed myself for not averaging down when the opportunity presented itself. 

Yet that is hindsight trading."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,>_<
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"you bought 90,000 dollars worth to make 3k? zzz"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,you‚Äôre gonna have to try a lot harder for that $5

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The shady Robinhood.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I buy dip every day
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not even that apish anymore. The stock has legs. People can argue about will it won‚Äôt it squeeze but there‚Äôs tons of money to be made just trading the chop.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The icons in your notification bar lol.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am very smart at this hindsight trading, unfortunately it makes no money. ;)

Maybe next dip you and I will have learned... until then I guess we just nibble crayons and feel smart in hindsightland."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúCalled when the price was $177‚Äù

He thinks he‚Äôs playing poker for some reason."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,ez.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that what you could come up with?  Bot account?  ü§£.  Found another fucking idiot.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope it does, it‚Äôs dumb as hell that people keep buying at the top, when they could have bought for way cheaper"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Getting on the Peter Thiel train is a good idea. The man turns everything into gold.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What moon? You would‚Äôve been better off just holding SPY or any other index. Btw DEGIRO is the real retard giving you 60k in leverage

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bet.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure why not. Flew right by 400 with ease.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This shit is what i browse wsb for. Godspeed you beautiful retard.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude i had a 406 call and sold it too early probably missed out on a thousand

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally this is that one moment and one opportunity Eminem meant by lose yourself. We will never see spy 420 after until spy $4200 üòÇ

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,SPY calls and EEENF are the only things holding up my account these past 2 weeks.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Take my daily reward you beautiful ape. This is what WSB is all about. GME tendies are the cherry on top.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,STONK ONLY GO UP. goodluck you psychopath
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck it. Im in!!!!

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The good ol days? Is that you?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop distracting the apes from the goal. GME AND AMC IS where the action is.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm gonna have to call F on that
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Street.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah... I sold a bunch of stuff just before expecting to buy it back slightly lower... Wish I hadn't taken that profit yet as many options would be 2x-3x now. Damnit my smooth brain.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not too late for a $420 call!

I did the same and sold Thursday around 3:00. Friends keep reminding me not to cry about winnings."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not too late for a $420 call!

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have put my limit order in earlier so that I got it at $0.42 instead of $0.53...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah it has. Most bad news has been cleared allowing for a nice pop over the next few weeks.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Betting against me?...  üåàüêª.

Not a financial advisor and I'm a total retard. My experience in buying SPY puts is that it is like swimming upstream. Yes, it will go down at some point, but it will trend up unless there is some other factor. 

But then again... I'm about as smooth brained as they come and buying puts against my portfolio is probably wise."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Market always goes up...eventually. You can make a shit ton guessing *correctly* when it goes down. If you guess wrong, I'll see you over on r/thetagang."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll buy more then too!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Never cry about winnings.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear that alot. SPY was 50% of my earnings today.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes sir...like bob marley said dont let em fool yea!!!spy has gone crazy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If I had set my limit at $0.42... but my timing sucked.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Stfu bitch. People have been betting on SPY long before the influx of your fellow GME retards.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wall.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,melt up mode is on
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those friends can eat my ball cheese, I sold early and missed out on 5k for 1k, more power to you"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,what date?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course, yeah I agree that it will forever soar to the moon. Hopefully I can just catch a $5 dip in the next week."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Understandable ty

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,4/21
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hard part is going to be breaking the support lines that have been recently solidified. I am hypothesizing that since going above 405,  400 stop limits were moved up to 402.5. Likewise, since breaking 406, some 400 and some 404 stop limits were moved up to 405.  

Totally feasible, but you are going to need bad news to provide the sell volumes to break those. 10 year t-notes have an impact, but now people are prepared for a 2% and the t-notes aren't as big a factor as they were a few weeks ago. 

But what do I know? I am not a financial advisor, I just like the stock."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah man thats good. But dont get caught in the euphoria is what we are saying. Especially when the fiery crash that is looming is so very obvious. Im not saying take profits now but Id keep my fucking. eyes. posted. Good luck and much love!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bet.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,bought for .51 üëê
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. I hear you, and that is in the back of my mind. I am actually playing with profits right now; like putting a lucky bet on black #7 on my way out of the casino. Even if this goes ""poof,"" I'm still happy."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wall.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bet
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I probably should have told you that I am not a financial advisor... I just like the stock.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"congrats..... 

Me waiting for 2nd push from ASO"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I should have bought more than 1 call lol. was up 200% this morning, still at 150%."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt blame you, IV is off the charts rn."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm balls deep in ASO calls and shares but I got in at $24. Unless you‚Äôre trying to play a possible squeeze (which is risky) I think it‚Äôs best to wait and see what happens. I def think this will be above $35 by 5/21 but you would need the price to be somewhere above $40 just to profit. While possible, it‚Äôs way more of a long shot play."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Same hoping for 35+ by next week
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The 3 options I bought on Wednesday morning are up 1200%. Talk about a ‚ÄúI wish‚Äù scenario lmao.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep.  I sold all mine and will more than likely buy back in, however I am sitting in shares for now"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You dont need it to be up 40 to profit. Option trading is about the IV
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold my calls at a profit and bought shares instead. Maybe if we have a down day this week I‚Äôll buy more calls.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Only regret right now is not buying more... XD. Sitting on my minor position though. Just gonna live with my mistakes.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea no shit, but IV spiked hard today. So if the stock doesn‚Äôt continue to make big moves, IV crush will probably kill the trade."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My current thought is to wait a few days for some IV crush and hop back in...  but We‚Äôll see I guess
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was just saying... If I ever had to even reach the strike to make money on a option I would be broke, I almost never reach my strike before I sell specially leaps"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, but that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre probably buying when IV is low and selling when it‚Äôs high. If you try to chase (I.e. buy IV when is high), and then things settle down, you‚Äôre going to have a bad time."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Amc is one of the best movie theaters. They have these large sofa style seats that are recliners with leg rests

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"so we listen to the one analyst who has a high price and ignore all the others who have it at $2. a few months before pandemic lockdown even happened, amc was trading at $7. since the float size has diluted by 4x since then, a current price target of $13 comes out to $50 pre-pandemic price, which we know it was nowhere near.

Seems like a blatant cash grab to run up the price for execs to cash out on once they dilute again. good luck to them, maybe with all this retail money they will eventually clear their $5 billion of debt."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have played both sides of this discussion. 

AMC unfortunately has very poor management which is why it continues to suffer. You are only seeing growth based on covid numbers- zoom out and see the whole picture. 

Todays uptick is good news- tomorrow's swing will be bag holders finally being able to sell off. 

AMC has huge potential, especially with this opportunity. However, they are running the business on the exact same business model that has bankrupted them over and over. 

I am happy you are up today- tomorrow or the next day the bears will be the ones posting- set a sell off point where you are happy with the profits and sell- don't hang on forever, because this eventually crashes."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Where's the supergenius with his 0.01 price target?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That analyst is on crack. AMC spends around $5 billion dollars per year, probably more now with their high debt service. They have to earn around $100 million a week in profit just to break even. Profit margin on ticket sales is around 50% and around 80% on concession sales. So ballpark they need around $160 million a week in revenue.

There just are not enough new movies in the pipeline to make that revenue happen which is why you'll see them selling more shares in May as soon as they can."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Today's gain is more of a return from the FUD of last week imo.  The movie theater business model was being questioned heavily with only AMC's price reacting to the overstated bad news
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, which it will not. Instead of paying movie theaters to display their product, production studios positioned themselves to do direct release with no additional cost (other than servers, which they are already paying for). In fact, the current breakdown is kind of obscene: 55% to the studio, 45% to the theater. You think any studio wants to keep paying that? No. Absolutely not.  


The other killer is that during the pandemic the home theater market **boomed.** Huge numbers of people decided it was a good time to build their own. Average TV size for US households is 50"". These are not the days of tiny TV's with crappy audio. Movies no longer require theaters to watch, and while some may still enjoy the experience, many do not - and did not before the pandemic, which is why AMC wasn't worth what it is now, then."

Yes, exactly. I'm fully aware of that. That's exactly why this stock was heavily shorted in the first place, when the rules roll out, HF can't not use illegal shorting to attack the price down, they will be forced to buy back and shoot up the price.

""further dilute shares "", do more DD so you won't get fooled by the FUD posts around. It's asking for vote and it's a strategic move in the future, not dumping 500m into the pool in a week like most of the FUD bashers here are saying.

Unless you are one of the FUD that gets paid lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not gonna write out an exact time line for you, but I have been in and out of the stock multiple times. Mostly day trading, made money and lost money. Got caught holding a decent bag and just finally decided to get out for good. Main reason being management. They want to dilute the stock even more now. There is definitely no squeeze happening which is why I stayed in it even long as I did. Im not here to sway anyone, I just laid out the reason I got out. I could give 2 shits about anyone else's money, so do as you please. I hope ya make money because its not my style to hate. I just don't see a squeeze happening at this point. I would rather put my money to work elsewhere."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk why I even give you the time of day but a company on the brink of BANKRUPTCY and 600+ million in debt should not be handing out bonuses. Its a huge ""fuck you"" to their share holders and their regular employees. Remember Toys R Us? 

What exactly have the executives done to deserve bonuses, huh? Oh that's right they cut down on their already minimum wage employees to make it harder on the rest, so double or triple the amount of work for those who stayed loyal or new hires. Yeah they saved money by screwing the average Joe, thats definitely deserving of a bonus... 

Get out of here....

EDIT: If he even replies he will rebuttal with, ""b-b-but its in their contract""... Maybe they should write better contracts.

Also, just doing a bit of research I can't find one single article on the average employee getting covid pay or anything close. YET, Adam Aron's (CEO) pay has doubled since 2019. DURING a raging pandemic even while the business was over 1 billion in debt. 

Now they want to dilute the shares even more... 

Correct me if I'm wrong but I haven't found one single article about the average Joe getting a pay raise. 

If you're hoping for a squeeze, I just don't see it. Even long term does not look good at this rate. Do your own DD folks. I just made a simple statement and it turned to this. My post history hardly has anything to do with stocks, I engage in reddit for fun. Not to spread FUD or pump stocks, none of that."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you serious? This is by all accounts a B monster movie hitting a better number than the previous one did pre covid. People LOVE the movies. We enjoy our big screen TV. But we LOVE seeing spectacles on the big screen communally with fellow fans. The CEO should be fired cause he‚Äôs a greedy dick head. If he really gave a shit he would pay down debt FIRST and then give himself a big raise. But that‚Äôs not the concern of the C suite jerkoffs running the company. With interest rates being in the toilet they should be rolling over debt into better term loans, and shutting down the least profitable screens nationwide. Negotiate tiered pricing with the studios so that movies with less special effects and smaller budgets still get seen in theaters at a reduced price so they can still generate revenue and give adults an outlet to escape besides JUST superhero movies."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"3.6 million streams from 3/31 to 4/4 being the best streaming opening ever doesn't sound like the nail in the coffin to me.  

Nobody would be excited if a movie sold 3.6 million tickets on the opening weekend.  Theaters see \~50 million tickets sold for an opening weekend blockbuster IIRC.  I'm not saying AMC is taking the entertainment world over.  Room for both imo."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"At this point, I‚Äôd pay to see Braveheart or The Big Lebowski in a theater just to get out of the house! Judging by the Kong-Zilla numbers, I‚Äôm not the only one feeling that."

Per https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx

If you take their best performance in the past 5 years, their net income isn't enough to even pay the interest on the debt they've accumulated."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me save you the time in google search, the executive bonus is an incentive while the stock is going up to prevent the CEO from selling millions of shares he already owns.  It further incentives him to continue the upward trajectory.   What do you suppose would be the market response if he sold shares.  Hurry up and sell and be gone (that‚Äôs if you even had any to begin with hmmmmmmm)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Only issue is the valuation of AMC right now. It‚Äôs too expensive considering all the debt and dilution that has happened as a result of it surviving through covid.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC Ticket Prices:

Children: $10.69Adult: $13.69Senior/Students: $12.69.

Average: $12.36. Multiply by 3.6M: $44.5 Million. Almost exactly what the box office was. That means theaters lost out on almost half of the people willing to see it.

Also relevant: Word of mouth for this movie is TERRIBLE. So I do not think it'll hit the same numbers this coming weekend.

For some perspective by the way, Avengers: Endgame made $357M on it's opening weekend. 'The Meg' which is a similar kind of movie made $45M on release, but only grossed $145M total. That's a good benchmark to see how healthy the theater market is after a month or so.  


EDIT: Disney movies are really going to be the telling tale though. Streaming new releases for adults might get those people back to the theater, but parents aren't going to be as quick to move away from home streaming. Trolls World Tour made over $100M just with streaming."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No doubt there will be a surge on interest as things open up due to pent up demand from the lock downs. But AMC didn't turn a profit during 2019 with all the huge block buster movies that came out. And now they are in a much worse financial position with a weak lineup. I think they are ""too big to fail"" but I'm betting the stock falls down to around $3 before year end. And then in 2022 starts to recover. At $3 I'm a buyer and at $6 I'm a seller. In between that I'd sit on the sidelines."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Any idea how much of the institutional holdings are more than one vote per share? I know Wanda Group used to have ~30% ownership but ~45% of the voting power.

(In any case though, it's been stated by a number of sources that AMC is in the class of companies where no singular entity holds control.)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"And? A company has an obligation to maximize the value of their shareholders, true, but not in the short term and not if that means ruining the company.

People wanting to make a quick buck due to a short squeeze means nothing when compared to the work of thousands of employees, etc."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They used that money to pay a sliver of their debt and gave their execs massive bonuses lol.

lmao bro were you not paying attention in 2008? plenty of less egregious examples out there as well, if you care. 

anywho. you do you. but, the company was declining pre-pandemic and there's nothing that can convince me that they've found a new way to stay afloat. inevitable $CNMK merger when the stock is back to < $2."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Rich Greenfield said it's worth $0.01. He's all in on streaming media as it's what his company does. He wants theatres to die. Of course he'd say that.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you lucid & ambulatory? Per your precious market ticker, $AMC up $11.2% today. Is there something your Hedgie-bot propaganda is missing?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The question I have is will it be enough because it's not like having everything open back up will magically make everything better for them.  [Take a look](https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/eps-ticker.php?q=AMC) at when was the last time they had reliable quarterly profits because, 2016 was a long time ago.  It's not that they won't survive the pandemic, it's that they won't survive the mountain quality new release streaming content.  I'm not saying streaming content will 100% kill the moviegoing experience, but it sure seems to be chopping into it enough to make it less of a thing."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I haven't researched it much but at the very least it appears to be no where near as diluted as AMC and it has a pretty high SI, which is good for it to possibly pop again sometime. At the very least its not facing bankruptcy that im aware of. As long as you're in relatively close to the price its at now, you should see some gains, even if its long term. 

This is just my speculation since I haven't followed it much, nor am I a financial advisor."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah you're right. He's won't sell them, remember he is passing them to his children.... He only wants 500 more million. 

Did you vote yes or no? Hopefully yes if you want company to survive. No, if you want a squeeze that will never happen...

Either way he won't be affected, he's already rich.. Are you?

Edit: And.. if you think about it, why should CEO's and board members have incentives to not be corrupt. Why is this even a thing???? I'm not the smartest man in the world but this world is so ass backwards... 

Either way, im done with replying.

Best of luck...

May we all be rich and powerful enough to be paid bonuses so we don't turn in to ""corrupt"" board members."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No I dont know how exactly the vote is split. I still personally do not believe shares will be added. AMC knows if they did, they will piss off apes. Like adam said on tv it's a vote on the Option to increase shares. He never once stated he would. Let me just say this. If you go back and rewatch the interview Adam has bottles of unopened champagne, kinda like he might have some thing to celebrate, like squeezing the Hedgies that tried to bankrupt them lol. I know this is all speculation I just found it hilarious. I know amc people read what we talk about. And they know if they diluted shares we would all sell so yeah i dont think that's happening anytime soon. The vote isn't permanent if the vote come back as a no, there will be another vote a few months from now. If he came back and said we need more shares for a buy out, I will change my vote until then it's a hard no."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,A sliver? They got $600 million knocked off and avoided bankruptcy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Massive exec bonuses"", most of the execs were paid in stock, lol. Aron's bonus of 15 million was at the time of valuation when the stock was at 15 a shares, it is now at this moment roughly 11 a share... His liquid bonus was 6.11 million, 2/3rds what it was in 2019. He and the other execs kept the company open throughout 2020 without the doors being open."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"For real, who are you trying to say is getting 2021 bonuses from companies they bankrupted in 2008?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Today's price has nothing to do with my original comment. Even if it was AMC is down almost 50% from its 52-week high, so what?

But hey, maybe I'm wrong, maybe AMC will go to $1 billion a share. Dump your entire life savings into it and post gain porn. I'll be jealous."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"2016 streaming at home was a lot more exciting than it is right now. Stay home of that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into. A lot of people are looking forward to getting out of the house this summer, with or without you bro."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because I was long AMC and know the company very well, and people are just reporting straight up wrong information - information that will make people buy it and lose money? Again if you disagree that's fine - feel free to dump everything into it and become a billionaire. However do it from facts, not easily provable misinformation lmao."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs probably just butt-hurt it‚Äôs one of those days where $AMC is up double digits while GME is down.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My point exactly. A lot of people are ready to get out of house again.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this. My 13yr daughter and I bought 6 @ 7.60 in early Feb, 3 each, she bought via her CashApp account. Trying to educate her as well as myself. Today probably good day to declare victory on AMC and move on, want this to be a positive (profitable) experience for her. She's always pointing out Tesla cars on the highway and spends stupid money playing Roblox so there's options, lol.  Thanks!!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds reasonable
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people yes, but how many?  It's going to be less than 100% of what it was in 2019 when AMC was losing money anyway.  Now take that revenue and chop it by at least 10%.  What happens to stocks when the business loses 10% of their revenue year over year?  Realize that 10% it's probably very generous because people can buy a month of streaming for less than a movie ticket.  People have also gotten into the habit of watching at home and have completely eliminated the habit of watching movies out.

Somebody did a DD here citing how long it takes for something to become habit and the duration of time that people have been staying at home and not watching in theaters is way beyond that threshold.  Movies won't go away forever, but a debt restructuring will probably have to happen been here and there and woe be upon anybody who thinks they're gonna just üíéüëê their way through it."
2021-04-05 18:08:51,wallstreetbets,"AMD Increasing Production by 20% in Q2, buy before earnings! Remember that there is no chip shortage. It's a chip demand. AMD is making more chips than they ever have in their history but demand is even greater than that. For an explanation, see this on youtube /watch?v=3A4yk-P5ukY So when AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su says that the chip shortage is a good thing for AMD, you can start to understand why. And also start to understand why AMD's stock can soar on earnings.

The news article on AMD increasing production in English is here:

[https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/)

They're getting the information from Channel Gate, which is in Chinese. It says that AMD will increase chip supply by 20% in Q2 compared to Q1. Now, this is rumors so the market isn't making any moves based on it yet, but it's likely that this means AMD is increasing chip production by 20% in Q2 relative to Q1. This follows Dr. Lisa Su saying that they are working on ways of increasing production to meet demand in an interview with Cramer a few weeks ago. You can find that interview on youtube /watch?v=h5HiWsAzahc So the rumor is likely true here.

Because AMD is selling everything they make, the increase in production will translate directly into an increase in earnings. Therefor, I expect AMD to make the official announcement of the increase in production along side a revised earnings expectation for the year in the next earnings report. In this market, you can't just beat earnings, you have to increase earnings expectations going forward, and that's what I believe will happen with the increase in production.

Another, unrelated positive for the company is that, due to retailers jacking up prices on AMD products, AMD has started to sell more and more of their products directly from their own store, cutting out the middle man. [https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us](https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us) They're doing this to ""ensure gamers can get AMD products at MSRP"" But really it means AMD is making an extra 20% off each chip. Brilliant.

I've been posting over the last month that I believe AMD is going to $120 and the jump will happen within the next 3 months. I still think this is true.

My AMD Positions: 550 shares, 55 calls spread from April 2021 to June 2022 at prices from $90 to $175"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is funny that AMD used to be this subreddit's darling yet very rarely we see anything AMD make front page. The bullish thesis on AMD is unbelievably strong. AMD is doing 50% revenue growth WITH chip shortages. Margins are growing rapidly and market share as well. AMD is entering new industries and new partnerships rapidly. Lisa SU has conservatively guided another 40% this year but with their usual beats this will be another 50%+ year, if chip shortages resolve could be 60-70%. Tesla AMD partnership has yet to be officially announced. It is likely waiting for the vote on AMD's Xlinix acquisition to be completed before they formally announce it.

AMD currently has P/E of 40 ..... for a company jumping 50% revenue a year. The stock price is heavily weighed down this past 6 months from Xlinix acquisition (which is done through stock sale giving XLNX holders a fixed AMD stock amount). Once Xlinix acquisition is completed and chip shortages are resolved, this rocket ship will take off and likely stock will jump 50% in a matter of months."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"first sentence seems to be not true according to TSMC CEO

he says double booking at his house due to china US tensions \*may drive chip shortage

"" Liu also confirmed for the first time that there is a serious ""double-booking"" effect in the industry, in which clients place orders for more chips than they actually intend to use. As a result, Liu said, his company has to expend extra effort to determine which orders are truly urgent and which will wind up sitting on TMSC's shelves.""

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you think of soxl? I find it strange how ASML and LRCX are so high while soxl and AMAT are so cheap? Am i not seeing something? are these undervalued or are the rest over valued?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"well their risk is certainly not shortterm, but longterm (you wrote ""next year"" above, so my point doesnt really apply to what you said). Anyways... The risk lies within the innovation pressure and that they rely on a small number of sales, naturally, as the devices are expensive. Longterm, new, big sales rely on their innovations. Expecting innovation in a certain time frame is risky, obviously. 

The manufacturer are the ones that actually fight the physics developing actual new high tech. People take the innovation for granted. its not. E.g. no one knows if the next generation (5000 series, should be 13.5nm tin drop, but larger (twice?) NA) will work or not - I mean probably it will, there are very smart people there, but no one (not even ASML) knows for sure if/when they will succeed with the next iteration (because its not what an ""iteration"" in an ordinary company means). 

The next closes thing to what ASML does is probably gravitational wave sensors, LIGO etc. Does anyone take successes/results from a gravitational wave sensor for granted? Certainly not.

Its  great company for sure and a clear BUY from me, and the main reason for that is that they are bloody smart. To some degree their expected (stock market) development relies on innovation (and I think more than other players down the stream) and thats risky by nature.

&#x200B;

ASML carries the burden of innovating the whole sector. And the problem is that people got used to the innovation and take it for granted, and those people set the prices of stocks."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, Zen is the arch. Ryzen is the product. Zen arch was introduced 2016. When the stock was like 3 or 4 bucks.

Buying after independent reviews? Yeah, why not. But you know what I thought back in 2016? If AMD was lying about Zen performance, they'd go belly up as a company. So their announcement had to be true. There was no way they would have been lying back then as it would have meant the end for them as a company. And that's why buying AMD back in 2016 was a 100% justifiable investment.

Still a good investment. I predict AMD to grab further market share from Intel. Especially in mobile devices and servers. They're already doing great on desktop with Threadripper and Ryzen.

With AM5 (PCI Express 5, DDR 5 memory) and another shrink to a smaller node at TSMC, AMD will continue the path laid out back in 2016. Solid investment.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They wrote 401.00 SPY calls and they bought 402.00 SPY calls.  In theory they'd just lose 100 dollars per pair of those contracts, exercising the call they bought to buy 100 SPY @ 402.00 (40200 dollars) and then having someone buy those 100 SPY from them @ 401.00 (40100, 40200-40100=100 bucks).

Usually if you don't have enough money to exercise a call either you sell before it expires or your broker does it for you, or your broker just goes *swish swish* at expiration and exercises one then the other even if you don't have the capital to pull it off.  This did not happen.  

The 402.00 calls they had, that allowed them to buy shares at 402.00 and cap their losses at 100 dollars per pair of contracts, those expired because they didn't have enough money to exercise, but the 401.00 calls they wrote didn't expire and they still have the obligation to sell shares to the contract holder for 401.00 per share.  So those got exercised and they were forced to buy SPY shares at 403 or 404 dollars per share on the market, and lost like 2-4 times more money than they anticipated.

This shit normally shouldn't happen with a spread, but it did."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I've seen some chip trucks turn over here
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,RIDE just threw my chips off the fuckin freeway the last 2 weeks
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,And some people just set fire to the entire chip factory
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not just any chip bag... A PARTY SIZE LAYS chip bag
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This really should not happen, especially not on Rh. Rh is supposed to close spreads for you if there is assignment risk (calculated by some algorithm they use). I wonder why they failed. 

This does show that you should ALWAYS close a spread manually just before expiration if there is any realistic chance of the stock finishing between your strikes."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs almost like the one thing I‚Äôve been warning people about while trading spreads actually happens... ‚Äúbut there‚Äôs no risk‚Äù... that they understand. On the bright side, I think bankruptcy only takes 5-7years to get over and start rebuilding credit."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôd ever do anything beyond simple buying/selling options on RH. Or even stay with RH for that matter.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Last call I got I made sure that I would be able to exercise if I need to so I‚Äôm not sitting there with my thumb up my ass.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I like (debit) spreads for trading high IV options.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Always buy to close unless you have the actual shares to take on assignment. Just not worth it.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">...thinkorswim didnt approve me for spreads. As you can see why lol

Oh my god. I love this so much. It's like removing your airbag because it was weighing your car down from going faster. Drive, you absolute ape, drive!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You poor bastard üò≠
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,RH approves everyone because they literally don't care if you make money in options or lose it. Spreads require a broker who knows what they're doing and is more advanced than click buy/sell
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ha I just applied for tier 2 margin options in TDA so I could do spreads. Also got denied and can't try again for 60 days. Did you try calling them?

Edit: Also sorry for your misfortune..."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood is supposed to close spreads like this for you, as they have done many times and continue to state they will do. If Rh says they will close spreads with assignment risk and then they don‚Äôt do it, then Rh did screw uo."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, spreads are a lot more complex than simply buying and selling shares, or other options contracts. Spreads require a real broker who know what they‚Äôre doing. And Robinhood doesn‚Äôt care who they approve for spreads, because they‚Äôre a predatory company who just want to make money off their clients. That‚Äôs why I say fuck RH."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but you're legging into them bc you have a fucking wrinkle.  This guy though...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,well that and you can never anticipate AH movement
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get that, but if you're selling naked options, that's a HUGE risk because you're counting on the person buying the option to NOT exercise it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is an account allowed to go so far negative, and/or get so much credit in the stock market?? 

I thought it can only go as low as the money put into it and then zero out"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,its so cute when people say things they dont understand
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood Killed him.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Who gives a 20 year old with no assets 200k in margin to play with. Guess I'll yolo with 200k that's not mine if I win retire at 21 and buy a beer. If I loose get a job and file Chapter 7.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol that is fucking rough. At 21 I was skipping by on minimum wage trying to get through college, never even considered gambling $200,000 on margin."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like that guy was banned with no confirmation. Could easily be photoshopped.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dead serious, bro. I think 3 types of people buy it: mothers who can‚Äôt produce their own milk for the babe, bodybuilders, and weirdos
Edit: congrats by the way, brother:) my sons my first and it‚Äôs a straight up miracle process"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Does your wife's boyfriend let you do foreplay? Make sure you bring a resealable container next time to secretly store the milk.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,don't tell her where it goes
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Or just stop using RH.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has happened before with other traders on RH. There's an options youtube channel called in the money that has a video on this very topic. 

Tldr: don't use this friggin broker"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,this is why you don't hold to expiration especially short the SPY
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If IV is high you're better off with credit spreads, implying that IV will drop over the life of the contracts. Debit spreads benefit from an increase in IV, so use these when you see IV is particularly low"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs still pretty much click buy/sell no matter what platform you‚Äôre on
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,RH says they CAN close spreads. It's not guaranteed
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing, then don‚Äôt do it. Simple as that. Don‚Äôt blame robinhood for giving people the freedom to be retards to their fullest content."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> because they‚Äôre a predatory company who just want to make money off their clients.

Isn't that every broker? I'm not aware of any doing it out of the goodness of their heart."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Op's play wasn't a naked option though. He had a spread that failed to protect him like it was supposed to.

Additionally, people who sell naked options will typically buy to close before their account blows up. You don't have to wait for expiration to manage your position.

But yes, you're right, it's very risky and you shouldn't do it without at least a few years of options trading under your belt."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You can go below zero with you are trading with margin
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trading on margin.  Options/spreads.  It's possible to fuck up your whole life with this shit, if you don't know what you're doing."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean shit.... sounds like a pretty legit start if you already have a car and a place to live but with little else going for you.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's more likely that he was given a much smaller margin of which he used a few thousand to make a call. Then like a true WSB retard that stock went the other way and that turned into a 200k loss lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Knowledge is dangerous
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> bodybuilders and weirdos

I like the implication that if they start getting muscles they are no longer weirdos"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has nothing to do with RH. Any other brokerage wouldn't have even considered closing your spread, so you'd be in the same situation"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Was just thinking about the video ITM did on this topic
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My spaceman gets it!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"but robin bad, man"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs a difference between being predatory and attempting to target those who are unfamiliar or simply ignorant of how many of those options work or are handled by the broker, and a broker who‚Äôs marketing toward people as a way to invest carefully and knowledgeably. RH offers very little support in terms of learning how different types of trading works."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently he wasn't even trading on margin though.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's even possible to fuck up your whole hedge fund with this shit...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just stay home like the rest of us apes. No need to go all elite and buy a house, a car, and a wife all at the age of 21."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to have to call bullshit because Fidelity closed some spreads of mine at 1pm costing me over a hundred grand. Also, Ally used to try to close my spreads too.

But also I don't think this is RHs fault. RH will close the spread although there's trickery to get around it. I suspect OP employed such trickery and got burned."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, but you don‚Äôt expect another broker to do that, so you as a trader would behave differently."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is not exercising the long side of a spread common practice with brokers? It seems dipshitted af. RH now has to chase down thousands from OP instead of instantly collecting hundreds already in their account
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You literally have to apply for options on RH, it‚Äôs not like they are luring you into some dark alleyway and forcing you to trade options so you can kindly fuck right off with the ‚Äúpredatory‚Äù language thank you very much. This is not something that only happens on RH."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">and buy a... wife

Oh I wish it was that easy."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"And their very clear that option trading is very risky. Hell I applied for spreads and waited for months before my profile was considered suitable. 

People just love to jump on hate bandwagons these days."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I know you have to apply. I‚Äôm saying they offer no support. And it doesn‚Äôt help when people get sucked in to the mindset of ‚Äúoh I can just make a quick buck trading contracts‚Äù when that‚Äôs not how this works at all. Sure a lot of it falls on the people who do no research and only see it as a way of multiplying their money, but Robinhood does a shitty job of ensuring their clients are well informed on how those different features work. Robinhood is also simply a garbage broker. And I‚Äôm not jumping on any bandwagon bullshit. I used RH during the March 2020 crash when they royally fucked over millions of people. I moved to TD and a little over to Webull after that fiasco and never looked back. Sure they have great UI and it‚Äôs easy to use, but speaking from personal experience, they‚Äôre scum bags."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not jumping on any bullshit bandwagon. Just was personally victimized by RH during the Feb/March 2020 crash when their whole system shit the bed. I‚Äôm speaking from my own personal experience on why I fucking hate the broker, nobody else‚Äôs."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs fine but the topic was about trading options and spreads, not system outages."
2021-04-05 17:44:53,wallstreetbets,Big Gains this morning on $ASO 
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good enough to screenshot.... di ya sell
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Just bought 50x may $35 calls at market open. They're already doing very well
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice. I had 10 $30c and 10 $35c that I got pre-earnings.  The $35c were practically worthless and they became my first 10 bagger (I did it mom!). I sold my $30c for about 5k profit and went full retard on the last dip and now have 50 $35c and 15 $40c. I think I'm pretty much in YOLO territory for my account now.

There's been a lot of great DD on this company and I've really enjoyed all the people talking shit on the play and people settings reminders to make fun of losses.  This was one I felt pretty damn good about."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you and greatz
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lots of folks missed the DD on this due to GME happenings obviously but I think there's so still much room for this. I'm holding a lot of short term contracts rn, gunna sell and and buy shares end of this week.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"My gains aren't nearly as big as yours but I spent 2,500 on some calls about a month ago and I just sold them while up 1,400 so I'm really happy."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you find the company in the first place?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read a bunch about VIAC and ASO over the weekend. While I agree ASO seems like the cheaper play...

  

There was one guy here who had a ton of VIAC calls and his comments seemed to suggest he knew it was going back up. (NFA). Hopefully it works out for you brother! Wish me luck on NEE lol."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Up almost 100%

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can confirm it's big in Louisiana
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't invest, but they went public last year. Beat earnings recently and have had a good amount of positive press and expansion in the last year"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"While I believe there is still plenty room for growth on this, the price of options are sky high now. The ship has sailed there."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,ASO just had earnings and did really well. Someone posted ASO DD on WSB a few weeks ago as well.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"this shit is gonna moon, going to 40 eom for sure"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If it can stay above 31 then yeah

Edit: nice"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"üìù we will follow your career with great interest.
Congrats on gains!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought a little out of personal interest a month ago. It had good analyst recs and it was a business I knew. I made this post about it:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/luzxmt/my_sporting_goods_play_aso_academy_sports_outdoors/

But then about two weeks ago I saw your post talking about Academy being a redneck mecca, and how it was primed for good earnings but had major short float. That confirmed what I was thinking so I bought a lot more. So thanks my man.

What really clicked me for is that you're exactly right, it's where rednecks buy their ammo and their Columbia sportswear fishing shirts, but it also occurred to me as a Houston resident that minority urbanites also love Academy. You won't see minorities in suburban places like Gander Mountain or Bass Pro Shop, but any Academy in Houston will be full of Hispanics buying soccer cleats for their kids."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I sold it all
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Noice
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope so!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No I didn‚Äôt just yolo.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol MMs bought up all the contracts at open and upped the price 4-5x. I was able to get some 40 calls for next week at .7 and flip at 2.40 like a minute later üòÇ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably best you sold. Watch it crash in the premarket tomorrow, now that its being talked about everywhere on Reddit."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,At all worried you didn‚Äôt sell? I took my gains on first minute candle lol. Thanks again.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is some bullshit how can the stock be at 50 two weeks ago with no approval and now be less than that after approval? Something just doesn't add up but I'm staying long.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Might dip into some may 60C
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for reminding me of this company, owned it back in October when I sold it to go YOLO on GME..."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this ends the week over $75, every call is ITM. Could have a squeeze potential as well.  I think last I saw was 25% short?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe this cycle of funds buying in after hours will continue for a week or more, can‚Äôt fall forever."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sold in the morning near the high then rebought just before close because I figured similar. Shares only though, no options."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely heavily manipulated, short interest was 21% as of April 1st, but I think the quants are just using the volatility to finesse some $$, which is why it was $70+ pre-market"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did a Yolo move at open, 50x may $35 calls. Already seeing some nice Shrek dildos on my screen."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I got $40c for 4/16. I tried to get 2 $35c but the price doubled 30 seconds into market open. Kinda sucks I didn‚Äôt get 2 but I still expect this to printüöÄüöÄüöÄ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,$ASO buried underneath GME/AMC posts but this is a legit company that is undervalued and with high short interest makes it only more attractive as a play

2021-04-05 17:38:04,wallstreetbets,"VIAC LONG POTENTIAL It‚Äôs my understanding that Olstein Capital Management plans to capitalize on the recent sell off from Archegos Liquidation Regarding a few VIAC & VIACA (Class b & a common stock). He did something similar in 2018-19 pre Archegos Interest. Let‚Äôs discuss.

First let me address why this matters and what VIAC essentially is set up to do in the Long term for my smooth brain apes. 

Now VIAC common stock jumped relatively 20% when our Tiger king Hwang jumped in on behalf of Archegos for this stock, however after being hit with one of the largest margin calls in US history he was forced to liquidate mass amounts of shares. 
This can be seen in the picture below at market open each day. Volume Consistent with what a consolidating sell off looks like. Point being it‚Äôs consolidated and ready to fucking explode. it isn‚Äôt a short squeeze situation because of the massive amount of shares available as well as the mixed bag of short/long option interest associated with the stock.

Just to put this in perspective CBS holds the rights to Paramount+, The Masters, March Madness and recently signed an 11 year agreement with the NFL. 

The NFL IS A 2 BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR SPACE AND THEY COMMITTED TO TELEVISE FOR 11 YEARS. 
NFLX CURRENTLY TRADES FOR 540 as solely a streaming platform. With nearly 10x the market cap of VIAC. 

250B for NFLX compared to 25B. However With CBS partnering with the NFL, PGA, and working towards perfecting Paramount as a platform. It‚Äôs not unreal to think the future will include NFLX pursuing an acquisition... in need of a sport entity within their algo. VIAC is positioned to fill the void. 

Diversification into Professional Sports is on the top of NFLX to do list for satisfying new investing rounds. Notice industry pressure from other companies > Hulu Live Sports , ESPN +, HBO live etc. 

To conclude. VIAC IS GOING TO BE AROUND FOREVER AS LONG AS NFL, PGA, AND JIM NANCE ARE AROUND TO KEEP BREATHING. MASSIVE VALUE TO BE MADE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. 



This stock is giving everyone the opportunity to get in on a Pre-Hedge evaluation of a Monopoly Stock looking forward. Of course I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and this isn‚Äôt financial advice but a bet on VIAC right now looks pretty tasty. Personally holding 20 x 45$ calls expiring 5/21. Anywho...VIAC TO PLUTO!!!"

2021-04-05 17:25:10,wallstreetbets,"$ROOT: Rise of the Seed of the APES üöÄ **I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a literal retard posting on WSB with a bias due to having a large position of my portfolio in $ROOT. So, proceed on your own risk... In addition, a lot of my DD was taken from C\*(i)Tron.**

I'll keep it short and simple... This is a one of a kind DD where the whole DD is basically a TLDR.

1- **Short Interest is 47.36%** (Fintel  2021-03-31). In addition, o**nly 2,000 shares were available for shorting o**n 04-01 2021-04-01 13:08:53 UTC(Fintel) with **a borrow rate of 8.71%!!**(2021-04-01 18:18:33 UTC). To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10,  that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. **We had 47.36% on Thursday** so a **short squeeze** is inevitable?

In comparison **of $ROOTS short interest of 47.6%(2021-03-31), $GME has a short interest of 18.81(2021-03-31) and $AMC 17.31%( 2021-03-31).**

2- Forget about the short squeeze... It also have a very high potential of **gamma squeezing**. The open interest of calls is high above 15$. The open interest of all the calls for Only 16 April is 32,261. In addition, the open interest bellow 15$ is 16,414 **which equals 1,641,400 shares!!!!** .Once it hits and stays above $15, the **gamma squeeze** could take it to a whole **new solar system**.

3-  ROOT is massively **undervalued**, Without factoring the massive short squeeze and Gamma squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**

BUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.

4- For Growth, the step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie). Bellow is the Chart:

5-  As the end of 2020, ROOT had 323K auto and 8K renters policies in force. According to the NAIC, **there were a total of 49 auto and 1 renters complaints against ROOT in 2020**. Which **indicates the BS that $ROOT shorts are claiming about customer complaints**. Additionally, I dare you to find any insurance company without complaints.

6- For the past week, everyday even today(weekend), I was receiving a ThinkOrSwim news notification advertising for a class action lawsuit against $ROOT. Some days I even receive it a few times a day, the same notification. The shorts are relentless in pushing this news while you have to keep in mind that Class Action Lawsuits **can take up to several years to conclude**. In addition, I dare you to find an old enough (Billion level company) which didn't or isn't facing a class action lawsuit. In my opinion, It's a distraction and FUD in the news cycle by the Shorts. Class action lawsuits are shitty law firms trying to make a name for themselves(IMO).

7- It has a relatively small market cap of 3.07B and a very small float. It reminds me of $GME preSqueeze when it was 3.5-3.7B now it's(13.39B).

**My short term Price target is 50$+ if a Short Squeeze +/- Gamma squeeze perfectly happens**"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I've read this very same post now 3 times I think.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Insurance guy posting yet again on ROOT, their market is limited to younger people, and they way they rate for annual mileage makes it a bad option for young people. I did their trial because I was curious, turns out that despite being 10/10 the whole time, I'm more expensive than I am with Allstate and Geico. The reason? They tracked and projected my annual miles. Every insurer understands that people lie about mileage, it's an accepted fact, that's why they rate everyone based on ~10,000 miles a year. ROOT limits their market to a very small group of people by doing this, and those people can get better rates with Milewise. Imo root is going to get bought by a larger company, especially if their back end is worth a damn. They have a good idea but their experience is lacking, they don't understand the business, and the market they started in will keep them fucked for a while. Google ""underwriting cycle"", ROOT is going to be a big insurer once rates go back up. Right now I'm absolutely convinced that, at least in Virginia, rates are too low to cover payouts. Sooner or later they'll have to increase, and ROOT will be the same price. That's the time you want to play around."

   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

2021-04-05 17:06:47,wallstreetbets,"TSLA effective short interest could be as high as 26% - potential incoming short squeeze **TL;DR:** TSLA short interest is not 5% as reported, but 26% due to float contraction & options bets, making the stock susceptible to a short squeeze.

DD:

----

- The 5.5% TSLA equity short interest of 44m shares [1] is only part of the ""true"", effective TSLA short interest: there's 2.6 million put option contracts open right now [2], a significant part of which are in the money, which, on a ~20% rally due to record Q1 results, combined with 2.6 million open calls, have the delta hedging effect equivalent to another ~100m shares short covered ...
- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

When ~26% of the float gets bought in an anti-dilutive manner on a rally then it is.

2.6 million put options are a *large* short bet, and their automatic delta-hedging, combined with call contract delta hedging, generates huge amounts of non-dilutive buying that has very similar effect as if ~100m shares of equity short position had been covered.

I.e. the full delta hedging inventory has to be maintained by MMs, regardless of the percentage expiring every week."

That's false: in early 2020 both Citadel [1] & Susquehanna [2] (two biggest TSLA options market makers) had to file 13-G filings, they both exceeded the 5% limit in their TSLA delta hedging inventory. (!)

They owned & are owning more than 10% of Tesla shares outstanding (13%) of the float - closely tracking ~90% of the delta hedging requirements based on open interest.

That's ~100m TSLA shares locked up by put and call options delta hedging.

Nobody sane uses GAAP income to value hypergrowth companies ... ü§¶

Do you really believe that valuing a complex company is as simple as elementary school division of two reported numbers?? ü§¶

Future expected cash flow is that defines growth & valuation - and with $5.9b cash from operations in 2020 and $10b+ expected in 2021 and +50% growth expected for the next years, Tesla is actually significantly ***undervalued***:

- Apple is valued $2t selling $1,000 iPhones at good margins
- How much will Tesla be valued selling ""$40,000 iPhones on wheels"" at good margins?

>decades of insane growth already priced in.

Haha, nope - and Tesla is growing into a 10x larger market than Apple.

TSLA is already undervalued if you go out to 2023. It's ***very*** undervalued if you go out to 2025-2030.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"All that says is a year ago they had 29M shares.  
  
Here's some questions for you:

* If youre making a market in both puts and calls, and sell a call to one person and a put to someone else, how many shares do you need to buy to delta hedge?

* If someone opens a put spread, how many puts are created? Compared to a naked put do you need to short more or fewer shares to hedge?

* Why would anyone who isn't a moron link to them owning 29M shares a year ago as evidence they must be shorting 90% of the required stock to delta hedge all currently outstanding puts?"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Talk about a short squeeze.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">All that says is a year ago they had 29M shares. 

Those are pre-5x-split SEC filings.

Those 29m TSLA shares would be **145m shares today**, and both options open interest, total delta and the share price increased significantly since then.

Their delta hedging inventory is likely larger today - my estimates are intentionally conservative.

>Why would anyone who isn't a moron link to them owning 29M shares a year ago as evidence they must be shorting 90% of the required stock to delta hedge all currently outstanding puts?

That stake was 90% of the delta hedging requirements **back a year ago**.

Options positions are public data, and I ran the numbers.

>If someone opens a put spread, how many puts are created? Compared to a naked put do you need to short more or fewer shares to hedge?

Here's how it works:

- A put spread reduces hedging requirements.
- Cash secured puts are popular in bearish episodes when investors move back into cash-equivalents - but are less common during bullish episodes like today.
- Share covered calls ***increase*** the number of shares locked up by options writing - non-MMs typically set aside 100% of the backing shares, they don't delta-hedge dynamically.
- If we correlate the various filings of the two biggest options makers with open interest data then we can readily see that a large majority of options are written by them. (This is the conventional wisdom on the Street as well - but nice to see the numbers confirm it.)

But that's roughly the maximum amount of free advice I'll give today to someone who called me a moron. üòâ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude what are you talking about. Go to the tesla website and look at the prices. Tesla could not sell 500k cars at 80k$.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool, so I'm not even gonna bother checking your numbers, but with all that said if there are 2 million outstanding puts why would you assume the MM needs to delta hedge all of them as if they were .5 delta naked puts, implying 50 shares a piece aka your 100M share number.

So all I need to do is get more people to call you a moron and you'll stop posting?"

During the first couple of days, I was seeing you all on TV and it really made my days. I was so proud of this sub. Before leaving, I had set my limit orders and then didn't have any computer access until January 29th.

In the meantime, most of my limit orders hit. When I finally got computer access on the 29th for five mins, I sold the rest of my holding.

I've now been completely sober for over two months for the first time since my early teens. For a while I had wanted to do something special for my parents as they're getting older. With this GME money I was able to buy them a car, straight cash.

**Now that I'm back, only one question remains. What is the next YOLO?!**

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stay humble and be careful. You're still not out of the woods yet. The first 2 months are undoubtedly the hardest, but your brain may not fully heal until about a year into this. 

Two things that can really trigger relapses are coming into a bunch of money or staying around the same people, places and things that you used to use around. 

It's definitely a big accomplishment to get this far. I know it sounds cliche, but it does get easier every day and time really can heal a lot of wounds. But going ten miles into the woods means itll take 10 miles to get back out. Tread carefully because 60 days isn't a whole lot of time. Also since this is basically a casino, don't substitute the substances with gambling. I was always addicted to danger and those rushes. I'm not quite at 3 years clean from heroin but my life has dramatically improved. Addiction feels like you're under water and then you're finally able to reach the surface and breathe. At 2 months sober, you're definitely not ""under water"" anymore but you're still treading in rough, choppy waters. Coming into a bunch of money can be dangerous for someone in recovery... Do you have family that you'd trust with that money? My paychecks get direct deposited into my wife's boyfriend's account and I get a monthly allowance from there so I can play stonk casino.

i mean unless GME dips back to the 150-ish or lower range which it might but even then i would only gamble a few thousand at the most even with 100k sitting in your account.

&#x200B;

at this point OP. you should put the money into a treasury bond (tbond) and gain interest on it. maybe 5k for gamble yolo money and 20k for everyday life. then the rest in a treasure bond if i was you. tbonds are the only thing right now with a high interest rate.

ive been in ur shoes specifically and was up massively 5 months ago and then lost 90 percent of the money in amazon options contracts... so if u have the gains take it and run. that is the number ONE rule is if ur up big take the gains. dont be like me and loose it all.

slowely im barely making my money back that i lost...but i am a seasoned retarded ape.... but not everyone is as retarded as me so plz do not be me OP... plz. PLZZZ... do the right thing for you and your mums. put that money in a high interest account be it treasury bonds or other kind of bonds etc.. congratulations OP.

though do set aside at the MOST 10k for yolos IMO... and be prepared to loose the 10k..

but atleast u have that 10k money aside to buy the dips (GME dips lol) at targeted levels if you decide to do so. (and a little secret advice - GME will dip because of the 1 billion dollar in shares that gamestop is liquidating to raise capital, when the SEC approves the sale it will dip big (the SEC wont announce when\* but u will know because of the big MASSIVE pretty obvious dip), but when it does dip be prepared to buy that dip, and u will get a nice tendy shortly after because it will go back up pretty fast but only do like 10k no more (shares not options), your welcome lol)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,congrats on sobriety and making bank.  next play is hookers and cocaine.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,On January 30th I went into rehab... Nothing wrong I was just holding GME... a thread lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,congrats on your sobriety and getting some tendies while bettering yourself.  Still bullish on esports and GME rocketing to the moon! check out some of the other s m a l l c a p companies that GME will need when it starts gaming in stores and theaters.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,BRUH RESPECT FOR TAKING PROFITS!!!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,i dont give a shit about your sob story
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy more GME and AMC. Its only 100k and this will not really affect your life that much tbh. Return potential on GME AMC is once in a life time, I think its worthy to at least put half that money in it and keep the rest for back up just in case.

\*This is not financial advice. I'm just an ape likes banana and stonk."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The next play is still GME bro... Grats on Rehab though.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,God damnit I‚Äôm proud of you. I‚Äôm still a worthless stoner. Keep your head on straight so you can manage the money that you‚Äôve made. Sound decisions will make you more.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hang in there, proud of you!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep buying dips
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"ironically, people were successful in treating gambling addictions with video game addictions as a proxy. So what you did here was replace one addiction with another less harmful one... But be careful - gambling addiction can be even more devastating than substance addiction. My advice would be to try to unwind it into something more positive like addiction to exercise or netflix or some shit - otherwise your life could end in disaster."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,F Legend! Even Legendary Peeps have their vices and faults. Good for you Fella.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a addict myself, take it day by day , work the program and don't try to do it alone. I've been blessed to be heroin free for over a year and alcohol free for years.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way! Stay strong!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"WSB got me interested in stocks and even though I lost the money I put in memestocks I gained a hobby that keeps me from frivolously spending money on: Expensive nights out, cam girls, strippers(if/when that‚Äôs a thing again), ect.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost 1 month sober from alcohol. Gme has refreshed my view of life. Before I didn‚Äôt think I would have a future now I am actively working on building my future. Finally going up after a decade of drunken stagnation.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cheers to your sobriety, friend. I quit the party life after 15+ years of rickety fuckery in January and haven‚Äôt looked back.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats on your success on both fronts my guy. Some how you were making the best and worst decisions of your life simultaneously and it all worked out. Stay strong! Your clean mind and body will benefit you beyond belief. I hope for you more victories and after that even more. I‚Äôm 3yrs clean n everyday is still a battle so with that I say take your time. Your past buys def weren‚Äôt  yolo plays. Looks pretty calculated to me. Use your clarity to be even smarter than you were back then about your next move. Again congrats!

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Big congrats on rehab and recovery my friend. That's a tough step and a long journey ahead of you. Glad you made some good profits. I think I sold on the same day, or right around then. Bought at 55, sold half at 380, the other have at 420 (blaze it) for an average of 400. Meanwhile, you've got people on other subreddits shit talking these trades while they make their boomer returns :p. Ah well, not everyone is bound to do well in the market."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking wholesome. Good to get your mind on something else during the process though.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats meeting makers make it

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt go to AA but I do believe in playing the tape forward and looking into the future and realizing what happens if you start using again. 5 years sober from heroin and meth.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"When are you going back to rehab?
We need the stonk to explode again"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I did the same thing with Bit-Coin
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"My GF has been on the waiting list for rehab for 6 months now, and is very close to death.

Yay Canada"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whatever you do, don‚Äôt get drunk enough to buy more at this price....."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice man! I got sober late last year. My account value has doubled since then. If you we're ""decent"" at trading while using, you'll fucking crush it while sober. Just don't go back man. Never go back. Even if you hit zero. Bad feelings are better than no feelings at all."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember to save some money for taxes
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Pay it forward
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,buy a kilo pussy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's really good of you to buy your parents a car. Serious respect for the love you showed. 

Now listen. You've just made the trade of your life. You got lucky. You hit the jackpot. You're fucking loaded right now. Don't rush into any quick decisions. The market will still be here tomorrow, and next month, and in 10 years time. 

At some point, everyone who plays the market has to know when they've made it. They need an exit strategy. If you just keep YOLO'ing your gains, eventually you'll lose everything. So many people on this make huge gains and then lose it all. Don't be one of them. 

So take $10K. That's your YOLO money. Play the market with it. If you're a good trader, you'll make that into another $100K in time and then have fun. If you're a bad trader, you'll lose it, but you'll still have your $90k to keep you warm at night. If you YOLO the lot, you could get more rich, but you could also end up with nothing. So ask yourself - are the memes worth the risk? 

Good luck bro!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,6 years here. ODAAT.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My advice: Take your money. Dump it into safe investments and live off an easy job + passive income. The situation is a rarity that you wil never see in another decade and you are set up amazingly now. Don't mess it up.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy more GME. Tf
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats and good for you for giving back to your family. I think whether you sold early or sell late (moon) it is right and good for all of us to give back one way or another. Take care of you and do worry about the next Yolo.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You're not clean if you're on suboxone.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro awesome I am a veteran and I went to detox the same week I been clean off herion since I am getting married in July my pension and options saved my life I am retired at 30 with 2 apartments in NYC
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,still gme and congrats. get back on in.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good work bud.

Last year, on new years day, I work up and decided not to drink for the entire year. I completed the task, and achieved a great victory, but then like a true retard I started drinking again.

After reading your post I'm taking another month off, and will see how that goes. I've definitely noticed that when I wake up sober I make better trading decisions during the day. So hopefully I'll see a nice bump in my Acc."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm recently sober too and a diamond hands.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Only 2 months?  Did you break into the phone box to get this message out while you had the chance?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good for you bro
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good on ya pal.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit, can‚Äôt wait to see your moves when your sober. If you can make calculated moves like that as a junkie, the sky it the limit for you.  Way to go crack head:)"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if you actually died while there, and all of this is fake, and you are living the last seconds of your fake life right now thinking you scored big on GME but in reality, your estate got the shares and your family wont have access to them until at least Apr 16?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy more GME!!! the real money is yet to be made
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lets do SNDL now!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the thought brother (or sister). In all fairness I say yolo in jest. I'm VERY cognizant of trading as a potential for risk and talked all about this GME win at treatment. I likely won't ""YOLO"" per se but I do appreciate good DD"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, can confirm, am almost a year sober and I started trading around six months ago. When I was up on GME during the initial spike, with a cost basis of 40, that was stronger than almost every drug aside from IV coke or heroin. Seriously, if someone could purify and materialize that feeling, and sell it as a powder, it would sell like hotcakes.

Fortunately, there's no risk of fatal overdose. That's replaced by the ability to commit financial seppuku

*Edit: full disclosure, I was able to turn $2000 into $50k at the peak, sold out quickly thereafter for $25k, and then promptly ran that down to $6500 chasing the dragon. I just passed $10k this morning actually, with a buy-and-hold / occasional covered call strategy. If you (OP) made all that money in options, be very cautious of buying options again -- it's very much like drug-seeking behavior. Calls work until they don't and concentrating into a YOLO can really blow up your account in mere minutes."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had just stopped drinking/drugging before my 20k GME YOLO in January and unfortunately all the energy I had put in to that addiction turned quickly into gambling. By mid February all the money was gone, it was awful! The rush you get from the market can be an unmistakable high. I'm in recovery now and have learned we need to lookout for substitutions. Sadly, I don't have any money in GME cuz I blew it all but I still read up everyday to see how the apes are doing. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|no_mouth) That said congrats man! Keep your money invested somewhere safe and stay sober. Best of luck to you!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait you‚Äôre not telling OP to coin flip their life savings until they lose? I don‚Äôt get it
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was really pleased to see this as top comment, my first thought was please dont be replacing one addiction / way of self sabotage with another. Just goes to show the quality of people this sub does have who usually just put on their ape mask."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I came here to say dude found his new drug and make emojis but you did the first part. So I'll pick up the slack.. üíé‚úãü¶çüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåõ

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you can. The quarterly taxes are to pay your 2021 taxes (so you don't have a huge bill and penalties /next/ April).

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My advice to you would be to take it seriously. Even if it feels cheesy at times. Do the work they give you and do it geniunely
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Best of luck to you - you can do it!

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Strange hill to die on, mental disorders can certainly be classified as diseases. They just tend to be different from diseases from viruses or bacteria or malfunctioning organs. 

Though with addiction it is kind of the brain malfunctioning. It should also be noted not all addiction is at the fault of the individual. Babies regularly come into this world addicted to drugs. People get drugs forced on them and get addicted.  Some happen when they are children and it‚Äôs pushed by their guardians which is outside the child‚Äôs control."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just because you don't understand it, don't just brush it off as an excuse. Also have some compassion! No reason to be a asshole because you can't comprehend it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I partly agree BUT certain people also have a higher propensity to use certain drugs that runs genetically somehow. If someone in your family uses a certain drug or alcohol then the kid can also show a higher affinity to that same drug
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you conflating the self-inflicted aspect of addiction with the physical reality of addiction. If I intentionally go around and lick every doorknob in NYC I'm very likely to get diseased If I inject heroin I am very likely to become physically and psychologically dependent. Not taking heroin becomes a noxious stimulus that can only be resolved by taking more heroin which results in disease in the most literal sense. 
The physical structure of an addicted brain is changed in a pathological way. A craving existing ""in your head"" doesn't make it less of a disease anymore than than epilepsy, alzheimers, Huntingtons, or the whole range of neurological/neurotransmitter mediated diseases.
Disease does not equal infection plus cancer plus autoimmune disorder. Disease is any  pathological discomfort or dysfunction of a biological system."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately though he has openly admitted he had a addiction, having overcome one to replace with another will with time put him in the same spot if not worse as before. Ending a cycle has to be accepting there are things deep down you physically cannot change. He might be thinking wow I feel great right now but again a massive loss will trigger all those old feelings and might very well cause him to start using/drinking again. 

I‚Äôm speaking from a point where I spent 10 years in a brick box realizing addiction isn‚Äôt something that just magically goes away and you are cured one day. You have to consciously make decisions each and every day to stay clean to prevent yourself from falling into something else. Not to mention op I survived hepatitis c treatment from constant intravenous drug use of 7 years your life literally hangs in the balance. Blessings up to Harvoniüôèüèª

Op if you are reading this understand you are playing with fire my advice on a life step you need to make is pull the money out put it somewhere and start finding what it is you might want to actually do with your life,time and contribution to this earth while you are here. Rehab does not cure it provides tools to manage and deal. You have to continually seek constant growth and change in your life in order for it to actually work. If you want to play the markets consider investing in boring growth not trading Of any kind that will put you in front of screens and cause emotional stirs and physical desires depending on how the markets move.   
Do I trade yea I do 
I also have many years of sobriety counseling and constant support from my wife kids and extended family. The same discipline I have towards my sobriety is the same discipline I use while trading and that has made me successful yes, but what works for me has ended many lives shortly and throws people further down the  rabbit whole than what they were. 
Take your sobriety and new found money and use it for growth and change be it personally or in your community but please op regain the understanding that you are an addict, and you are always one move away from either death or despair. This sub can be poison but it does have its beacons of light hidden underneath the bull this sub has also changed my life and taught me risk management and prioritizing that my personal tolerance on gains and losses are completely separate and detached from the loss and gains we see here. 
If you find yourself in the Arizona I do inner/city outreach with animals for people just like you and me. Money is great yeah but educating and supporting your community of people with your same pitfalls will reward you better and longer than any fd ever will be able to. Dm me whenever 

Can‚Äôt wait to get shit by you guys for trying to help someone in recoveryüöÄüöÄüöÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, but now that he's tasted the sweet sweet tendies, good luck just cashing out and never chasing that high again."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its overdone/oversold is all and a sensitive subject for snowflake types. So, like many things these days, an honest discussion is hard to have. As someone who lived that world for 20+ years of heroin addiction, there is a GREAT DEAL of personal responsibility involved. It's also true that it is a mental illness. But it's a mental illness you can seek treatment for (and also one you caused yourself through poor choices and actions), so if you choose not to do so,*shrug* the consequences are on you. My long lived experience is that most drug addicts are exactly where they want to be and deserve little sympathy. That said, if and when they are ready to quit it is of extreme importance that they have the support and tools necessary to do so. That benefits all of us."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Federal isn‚Äôt your only tax obligation.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Ending a cycle has to be accepting there are things deep down you physically cannot change.

This is a ""slippery slope"" thought to have in recovery. It's important to know that you have a problem, and that you continually need to work on yourself but it is NOT good to have the belief that there are things about you that you CANNOT change. If it were true that you cannot change, then recovery would not be possible. I've seen countless examples of people doing things they never thought possible or behaving in ways they never dreamed of. It's important to know that change is not only VERY possible, but inevitable. We just need to make sure to guide our change in a positive way."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me ask you this after 20 years of banging tar  you didn‚Äôt ever feel like you had lost all control because you were physically and mentally addicted to the drug? What might start as a choice quickly turns to a need no? Understanding that genetic dispositions and the way we are wired play a large part in the choices you make is key, environmental conditioning also unfortunately affects these same decisions. Personal accountability comes after you accept you have no control because you have rewritten the code inside your brain then you
Hold yourself accountable by choosing to not use then you progressively manage the good choices you make then you experience growth from the positivity of being sober. It‚Äôs unfair to say that this all someone‚Äôs choice or even a large part of it is someone‚Äôs choice. Most often times drug use and alcohol abuse and the general degradation of ones body stems from trauma that trauma was almost always definitely not a choice from the addict. 

I commend you and your achievements in maintaining sobriety and applaud the fact that you understand choices are what you make of them, but unfortunately it‚Äôs not a one size fits all when you speak of the root causes of why people use and abuse in the first place and make those choices"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,40k isn‚Äôt the lowest bracket
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, could you give me an example situation where you pay 800,000 in taxes on 40,000 in gains? Not seeing how this could be possible."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know if this only applies if you make exorbiant profits?  what about smaller profits like <$100?  is it still based on your income threshold/gains amount?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The point to that thought is ‚ÄúYou will always have an addictive personality, so no, you can‚Äôt drink just this one time, you can‚Äôt just do this one shot of heroin with your friends, in fact, you can‚Äôt hang out with them at all. You have to accept you have limitations your friends don‚Äôt.‚Äù

It‚Äôs also along ‚ÄúI have social anxiety, and I need to get used to it and work around it, not drink and take pills to try to numb it‚Äù.

So there is validity to accepting your position and chemical makeup in life."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand your point however where i sit and what I see there is No changing a deeply psychological illness there is accepting managing dealing and growth. You will never ever come across an actual addict who says they never have fleeting thoughts of using or abusing, and playing games that inject massive amounts of dopamine and serotonin is a very fine line and lines get blurred to easily in the time we live in
Well what‚Äôs one drink 
Well what‚Äôs one hit  
That‚Äôs where the slippery slope starts and in my personal and professional opinion you must first come to grips that there  things you cannot change about yourself but choices you directly control. 
I counsel and have counseled many people I have seen to many people relapse/die because they thought they changed themselves in such a way to where they have everything under control only for a bad situation to arise and them lose complete control"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I will say thank you tho for encouraging op everyone is different and recovery looks different for everyone
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont disagree with any of this. My point is simply that the issue, like most other issues, isn't as black and white as folks on both sides of debate might like to pretend it is. It's not simply ""oh those poor dears just got unlucky and caught a disease!"" Nor is it simply ""oh they are just degenerates with a moral failing, they dont deserve any help"".

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because it's not. These people are retarded. Here's how it works:

Money gained from investments aren't taxed as they happen. You tally up your gains and losses and if by the end of the year you lost more than you gained, you don't owe a dime. In fact, you can apply up to $3,000 of losses towards other sources of income (your job) and even roll the rest forward $3,000 a year at a time.

These people are clueless saying you'd owe $800,000 worth of taxes on $40,000 gains. Fucking dumb."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"ok

Edit: My extreme stance seems to have turned the crowd against me."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It applies to all gains. Unless you hold the security for more than a year then it's long term capital gains.

There are also special cases like options on index, like SPX. Those are always taxed at 60% long term capital gains, and 40% short term e.g. income."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well In enters religion politics and cultures. We were all raised differently and programmed differently and to get a unified understanding at this point in humanity will be near impossible. Seek the change you want daily first in yourself then in your community. Common ground isn‚Äôt as uncommon as we make it but to get everyone to see this first is a constant battle against big tech and society as a whole. Humanity isn‚Äôt done for but it‚Äôs getting to the point to where division and finding unity inside the division is considered unity as a whole. 
Removing fundamental ideology that has built and burned the world since we apes started exploring sounds crazy but as crazy as this sounds until that veil is lifted we all will remain shrouded and blinded by our own thoughts and views and unfortunately the cycle will continue. It‚Äôs depressing when I look at it like this and say this but it draws me back to me trying my hardest to reach one person at a time in hopes a cycle of positivity love and giving develops from that one person to only be perpetuated to the next and the next. 
Don‚Äôt know you but your heart seems big my friend share it with the world and when the world does wrong to you shrug it off and only continue to share your heart that much more you will see the positivity and change you desire maybe not on a world stand but in order to get to 2 you first have to give 1 to 1"

No, they will not.  What they will do is issues shares during the squeeze and make a shit load of money right along side all of us.  This is chess not checkers motherfuckers."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember how GME didn't do their 100M raise when the stock hit 483 in January because they didn't have the financials handy and were afraid about raising while in possession of material financial information? 

Guess what they just did this morning? 

1. Released material financial information for the market to digest (+11% first 9 weeks of Q1 sales)
2. Adjusted their at the market offering and arranged it to show they think this stock will AT LEAST go to $285 a share. If it goes to $1,000 a share, they will only be raising the $1b max, so that would be just adding 1M shares -- a 1.4% dilution (non-event). Don't forget, GME bought back tens of millions of shares in the last 12 months.

BULLISH."

Over the past 2-3 months they‚Äôve attributed every GME price drop to a ‚Äúsell off‚Äù or ‚Äúprice correction‚Äù and have twisted words around and foreshadowed that GME is tanking over and over again.  Yet retail holds, the dips get bought up, and the price recovers every time... and oh yeah, I now own more shares from the sale.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck I'm getting wrinkles in my noggin faster than my nutsack right now.

In December 2020 they filed for the right to sell 6.1M shares for up to $100Mil.

They cut the number nearly in half to 3.5M shares, but 10X the profit cap to $1bn. They are limiting the shares that they could possibly sell by a fuckload, this is FANTASTIC NEWS for retail/longs.

GameStop could have sold anytime after 12/8/20 at $16.66 and capped their profits. Any. Time.

Instead, they did not sell a single god-damned share and chose to reduce the amount of shares they could even offer by half, on a long-term prospectus for the company. It only makes sense to do that if you believe the value of the stock will significantly rise.

Currently they would be able to capitalize the full $1bn at a share value of $285, should they wish to dilute their shares by 3.5 million. Past actions show they have preferred to maintain their float low despite having a good profit opportunity. 

Why? Well, if I can get $1bn on a tenth or less of the shares I have to offer, why wouldn't I just wait and keep my value per share nice and high to make it ever-more difficult to continue to short my company and keep manipulation to a minimum.

# GAMESTOP IS SUPPORTING ITS INVESTORS AND HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED THE AMOUNT OF SHARES THEY COULD EVER OFFER TO SHORT SELLERS.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if there are more shares shorted/borrowed than exist, wouldn't introducing 3.5 million ""new"" shares do... nothing? It would allow Gamestop to raise capital during the squeeze while HFs are still forced to cover 100% of shares.

In other words (not sure of real numbers), if 69 million real shares exist, and HFs have borrowed 420 million shares, buying all 69 million shares versus buying all 72.5 million shares to cover wouldn't matter as they're both under the 420 million they're on the hook for?"

Positive. It‚Äôs exactly what a company SHOULD do to secure capital and pay off debt and have capital to invest in the transition.. several things to consider.. A) if GME is as shorted as some claim (500+mil shares.. what do you really think 3.5 mil shares will do to the squeeze.. that is 0.7%.. a drop in the bucket. B) they are not saying they ARE selling those shares tomorrow... it just gives them the right to sell when they want.. soooo they could wait until it starts squeezing then slowly sell 100,000 here and there to grab some profit without it affecting the price negatively.. so just relax and trust that no matter what the board is only doing what is BEST for GME long term.. so if you like the company.. and the STOCK.. (which I do) then you just have to hold and ride it out with the company and slowly grab some profits when they do if you‚Äôd like. Peace and love to all!‚úåüèºü§üüèºü§ôüèº

The announcement today is genuinely irrelevant to us, its basically Gamestop saying that when it squeezes they have the right to make some cash out of it too, either 3.5mil shares at most, or capped at 1bil earnings from share sales, whichever they hit first.

Basically when the stock goes to 10mil per share, Gamestop could sell 100 shares and that would be the cap hit, so they wouldn't need to even sell 3.5mil."

Share sales is a company option they had a similar program since December and have not sold any shares under that program. Share sales, if done will be to speed up the shift to e-commerce overhaul led by Ryan Cohen. Company is awaiting the liftoff in stock price.

Even if enforcement agencies don't immediately begin to hold institutions accountable, the sentiment shift is in the air, and it's thick and suffocating. The writing is on the wall. Pressure is mounting and it's just a matter of time before the domino's topple.

They had the right to sell 6M shares for $100,000,000 as of December 2020. They could've sold for max profits from $16.66 and onward.

They did not sell a single share of that, and have since reduced the shares they can sell by almost half to 3.5M shares and 10x'ed the profit cap to $1B. They aren't dumping on us now.

I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, and I eat bananas all day.

I‚Äôm no one, just a lurker ape, but reading some ppl panic about GME selling made me want to say some things loud and clear, again, it‚Äôs just my opinion.

1- it‚Äôs a really good thing because they want to capitalize in the MOASS.

2- they just said in their request they think GME will be $285 or higher soon.

3- they can sell less shares for a higher price per share. 

In short, they are bullish $GME will moon and want to get some tendies to help the company grow, and they like the stock.

That is, in my opinion, one of the best news we could have, it‚Äôs one more sign confirming the price will moon.  

They can sell up to 3.5million shares up to 1bil dollars total, but they can sell less shares in the short squeeze. So they can sell:

1 million shares for 1k each,

100k shares for 10k each,

10k shares for 100k each,

1k shares for 1mill each,

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, when the stock hits a certain price it will trigger a margin call, forcing all borrowed shares to be repaid back to the true owners. And if they have shorted more that the total volume of float (which are the only shares available for trading) it won't matter if big short man (who reportedly owns about 5% of the total float now), or any other whale for that matter, sells before peak, because they'll still have to keep buying, it will likely cause bumps on the rocketship ride to alpha centauri, but at the end of the day they'll still have to purchase *all* of the available float back (which means any shares that retail owns, they need to buy) 

Tldr: whales like Big Short man selling pre-peak won't stop the rocketship, but will likely cause short dips on the rocket ride, because the whales don't own all the shares the HF need to buy back

Anybody care to comment on what they think? Am I wrong about something? Elaborate on something?"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"# Got a question?

Okay kids, it's time to have a sit-down with Dad and learn how *not* to ask a question. This way, you can get some answers without being downvoted to oblivion, and you won't accidentally spread FUD (or Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt, for the newbies).

0. There is no ""we,"" so no, ""we"" can't all buy at the same time to trigger jack shit. Do your own research and do what you want with your own money. When I talk ""we,"" I'm merely referring to people who happen to think positively about GME by coincidence. If I see you trying to sway others to buy or sell, you're *so* grounded.

1. Never ask if it's over. For one thing, you should be reading the DD every day as more is posted. If you're investing in GME, then you should know what the fuck you're doing; otherwise, I'm sending you to military school. Now go and sort by the 'DD' flair, you imbecile.
2. Don't ask if something is good or bad, just ask for it to be explained. The top comments on this thread will often have a breakdown for you smoothbrains, usually in layman's terms, so fucking read them. If you don't see a sufficient answer, just comment something like, ""Can someone ELI5 whatever news you're all talking about?"" Don't ask if the news is good or bad, just ask for an explanation.
3. Stop asking if the hedgies can ""theoretically do an infinite loop-de-loop triple whatever"" and cover by accident or in secret. This is like asking if you can use your unrealized gains to buy more shares of the same stock... You're stupid.
4. Stop asking for a price target. Nobody knows, and you need to stand on your own two legs and eat your damn vegetables. Read the DD. Wait, did I say that already and you still haven't done it?

TL;DR ‚Äî Ask your questions carefully so you don't get downvoted to shit. Stop sounding like a whiny, paper-handed bitch. See examples above."

It's smart as well cause....they gonna sell those shares at $1k+ a share when we get there. HA!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So 1bil / 3.5mil shares = $285/share. That's assuming they even sell 3.5 mil shares, say they only sell 1 mil and cap at 1 billion that's $1,000/share"

Fellas....I may have rose colored glasses but I have and do own several businesses. This announcement is EXACTLY what I would do if I had any inkling that a massive price spike was coming to COVER my ass when I sold and profited majestically from the spike. It removes the ability for market makers, sec, dtc and anyone else to determine that I have manipulated the market in any way. Frankly, I see this as EXCELLENT news and will now massively buy the dip...perhaps even double my position. This is bullish as F IMO."

They‚Äôre just resubmitting it.  They‚Äôll likely sell gradually to not affect the price (or the squeeze) to raise some capital, but not if it‚Äôll tank the shares. If they wanted a dilution or to dump 20 million shares at once they could have done it that way, but they opted for smart and safe.

The original [prospectus](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18351/html) filed 8 DEC 2020 for the ability to sell up to $100 million in shares at the time would have been 5.9 million shares at the 8 Dec closing price of 16.94. No shares have been sold to date under that registration and today they filed a supplement to that prospectus.

This update bumps the monetary cap to $1 billion, and adds a share cap of 3.5 million.

* they say they \*can\* sell. meaning they can spread it out however they like, whenever they like, and may or may not do any or all of those 3.5mil. 
* at the market means they do it on the open market - so they haven't even started yet. 
* current price action is people selling on news they don't like. short term 3.5 mil shares added to float will lower price, long term means more for us, core cash for gamestop = good for them."

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

Under this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, and accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement, ***we may issue*** and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales proceeds of ***up to $1,000,000,000*** (***but in no event more than 3,500,000 shares of our common stock)***, from time to time, through Jefferies. ***It is unlikely that we will raise the maximum aggregate offering amount when the number of shares we may sell is fixed unless the average market price at which such shares are sold is greater than approximately $285.00 per share (which significantly exceeds the historical average price per share of our common stock)***. The amount of proceeds we will receive from this offering, if any, will depend upon the actual number of shares of our common stock sold and the market price at which such shares are sold. Because there is no minimum offering amount required as a condition to close this offering, the actual total public offering amount, commissions and proceeds to us, if any, are not determinable at this time.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, if any, for working capital and general corporate purposes and to further strengthen our balance sheet, which may include funding our transformation initiatives and product category expansion efforts, the repayment, refinancing, redemption or repurchase of our existing indebtedness, and capital expenditures or the satisfaction of our tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock held by our executive officers and other employees. Please see ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äî‚Äù *The manner in which we fund tax withholding obligations that will arise upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock awards may result in sales of shares of our common stock into the market, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.*‚Äù in this prospectus supplement.

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing securities or accounts.

If you want to deny GameStop the opportunity to make some money off this too, Harambe would be ashamed. They‚Äôve had our backs this whole time. They will make the smartest move for their billion. I don‚Äôt see them selling at 285 when they could retain more shares and wait for the squeeze."

What I'm not sure to believe is whether there are apes dumb enough to sell over this news, or that it's a short attack driving down the price right now. Can someone clarify while I add 50 shares @ 163?

I'm more pissed that I missed the bottom"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Pleas green again
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was enough for it to bump up enough for my limit sell to kick off and I excited in the green.  It sank beneath that.  Saw the ""big news"" and set my limit accordingly."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Companies with no revenue are better. Once you've got revenue people will ask how much and it'll never be enough.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea this good news really needs to stop.  It‚Äôs pissing me off.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I laughed way too fucking hard at this comment üòÇü§£ 

Not sure if it‚Äôs my way of dealing with depression or this is just amusing."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sad but true. My leaps are pretty much worthless now.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,90 mil won‚Äôt be enough to have an impact at its current valuation
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúSell the news‚Äù
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,cause pltr is overvalued
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Every time good news comes out stonk goes down. Seems like they need a huge data breach or a scandal to increase the stock price given the fact that the stock does the complete opposite of what every anouncement would do to a normal stock.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"70% EBITDA contribution, everything looks good"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a government contract, so it carries more than its monetary value by setting a precedent for future, larger ones (assuming that pltr does well).

Not sure if Palantir had many previous contracts like this, I'm not in the loop. If it didn't, then I think it's great news. Otherwise, yeah, 90M isn't a lot of money."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The year is 2382. After centuries of inflation, coins are no longer minted. Giving a benjamin to a stripper is just insulting; can't buy anything with that. Wallstreetbets is gambling on SPX $420,420. PLTR, now a conglomerate with trillions of annual revenue, trades at $26/share."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet of they lost one that size it'd drop a hell of a lot more
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Came here to say that ! It‚Äôs a tiny contract doesn‚Äôt make the company suddenly worth 10billion more !
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,To be fair other posts were over holiday weekend. Nothing wrong with a quick reminder before market open. üëç
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,shouldn't ~20m per year make it rise by ~2b assuming 100 pe for high growth? if this was TSLA pe (1000) it would rise by 20b or am I retarded?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Noone cares about those doodles
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So?...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So they increased revenue 10% with a long term commitment ?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Truth. The market is basically opposite world.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Still down 26% but that‚Äôs better than it‚Äôs been in a while.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Revenue is a metric.  Without metrics stocks are left to trading only on good feelings, hopes and dreams."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Palantir has more value in our society that you will ever have
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost half of palantirs revenue is from government contracts.  This is generally where they made all their money over the years.  Moving to commercial and trying to grow that is where the stock premium comes in.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Palantir did a lot of federal business during the Obama administration.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,(After multiple splits) üòé
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Losing a government contract has much larger negative connotations than winning one in the first place. If someone had won the contract over them then it likely wouldn‚Äôt have changed anything, but if they had a contract and the govt put a stop work on it or canceled the contract then it would be very very bad."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,this.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So it shouldn't have a significant impact on anything.
Should land one of these every month just to stay steady, and it's currently not valued for ""steady"".

On the flip side, we need to see one of these quite often, so blow the horn and release the confetti 'cus they just landed a deal that makes up more than 5% of a years bizniz. Most businesses are the sum of many many sales, so although it's nothing huge it's still a nice sale."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's 90 million for 5 years. Their marketcap is 44 billion. That is a drop in the ocean.
Not really news worthy."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope. It's only guaranteed $7m, with the possibility of scope-creeping to $89M over the course of 5 years. Comparing to annual revenue, you can only take 1/5 * ~$90M = $18M per year as a max. 

$18M is $0.018B. At best it is a 1.6% revenue increase. It's definitely a good thing, but not a game changer."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Until gme crashes all the hedge funds and resets the market to non hacked mode.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short selling the good news to accumulate as much value on a stock. Let it pop when the good news starts to dry up, sell at the peak for a gain and buy back in if you want at the bottom...
Sounds like hedge mischief to me."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"But as long as we all agree something is worth more, then we can all make money... no need to get things like ""revenue"" involved."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That burns.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe wsb should stop jerking off at paltry 90 million dollar contracts lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,no need to get emotional bro. Those bags must be heavy

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They better not crash. Im balls deep in CSPs
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GME not gonna crash
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme not crashing üôÑ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is literally called a bubble lmao, and they are really really bad"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GME's not crashing; I think they meant the hedgies crashing when GME moons
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"no no, gme rockets, all of the hf get margin called, rest of the market gets a fire sale, is what i meant."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"not gme crash, market fire sale when gme moons."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn nice grab.   I'm in middle of transferring to Fidelity and a lot of my funds are locked up.  I was more worried about missing a big dip then I was of missing the squeeze.  Looks like I was right.  

GME has me all fucked up.  I get excited for red.  We all know the shit will just explode back to $185-$190.  Well let's hope transfer is over this week.  I'm getting closer and closer to triple digit shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good for you on getting in on the discount.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,We are everywhere mate
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Correction - they announced they would sell _up to_ 3.5m shares back in December. What they did today was revise the $ limit to 1 billion.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This 3.5M share potential offering is amazing! Gauge market interest and hedge fund/mutual and ETF interest and then set the price for those shares! Smart fricken move!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm just wondering how long this will occur. I don't think they will try to dump 3.5 million shares all at once. Just wouldn't be smart.

Couldn't they buy and exercise puts on Friday so they don't affect market so much?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If only some clown didn't defund our pandemic team the year before that...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I was down 2k for like 5 minutes haha
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do you, buddy. More bananas for us."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In December the share limit listed in the prospectus was 6,116,207 shares. So in this revision they have both raised the potential total $ limit and decreased the total share sale count."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs legal to buy puts on your own company, but I‚Äôm basing that off logic and I could be wrong."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I doubt they'll perform this at all until the stock rips again. Price needs to be at least $285 to raise the maximum amount of capital. Also, the earnings report showed they are already paying down debt, so it wouldn't make sense for them to dillute the stock to improve their balance sheet. It only makes sense if the intent is to raise money to expand operations after the price increases substantially beyond its current value."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They will release them during squeeze...maybe?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the correction. I missed that they lowered the share count.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It is. Buying derivatives in general is pretty much illegal if you work for the company
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying puts is not necessarily a bearish investment when the intention is to actually sell the stock. It's simply a method to go around the open market to sell the stock at a contracted price.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In their filing with the SEC, you can see them say ‚Äúwe filed something identical to this in December, and didn‚Äôt sell any shares through the program.‚Äù  It‚Äôs the equivalent of putting in an application to trade options (if it had to be renewed every 4 months) - it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre trading them already, just that you can if you want to.

Woke up to the news, did some due diligence, but this form of stock sale potential will allow GameStop, if they want, to slowly sell securities to raise money.  They won‚Äôt do it all at once, because it‚Äôs not in their interest to promote panic, (no panic or price drop is  the purpose of this type of offering, versus a bulk sale, new share issuance, etc)

Minus that minor morning heart attack I‚Äôm extremely bullish on the company and the squeeze.  Almost thought it was a major dilution or something dumb af based on the headlines.

Edit:  Here‚Äôs the prospectus from the SEC if you want to see, bullet point 2 shows that no sales were made on the last version of this.  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119312521105564/d160986d424b5.htm#supprom160986_12

They also lowered max shares allowable to be sold from about 6 mil to 3.5m.  All signs point to hot damn."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just to be clear here: 

""under which it *may* offer and sell up to a maximum of 3,500,000 shares of its common stock""

There is NO timeline listed on *when*.

Edit: ""From time to time"" is the *when*, thank you apes below me for catching what I did not."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They had an old offering agreement with the ability to offer 6 million shares that has expired.  This is probably just corporate due diligence ... they have a company to run ...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Europoor market is closed today, because of easter Monday. Enjoy the great dip, Ameritards!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Be a fool not to cash in when it blows up 3.5 mil is nothing to what is short they are preparing so they don‚Äôt miss out
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a good thing TBH. Not near the careless amount AMC issued
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"if share price goes to 1k, it means they will only offer 1M shares. Depends how this is handled and time frames.

So the more price increases, the less they offer. 

A really salty investor who doesnt believe in squizzing could say the max value put on the shares is 285$ per the text, but if price goes higher this isnt the case."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's why they just tanked 11% instantly...

Idk why mods keep removing this extremely important news


E/ sorry, 16%


Aaaaaand rocket has fueled!!! LETSGOOOOO"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,About time; they needed to do this to fully transition to an e-commerce company.  It‚Äôs a 5% dilution; I am more bullish!  Time to load up on the cheap shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Literally following Tesla‚Äôs 2020 squeeze playbook. Tesla raised 3 times as its stock price rose from (post split) $88/share to $700/share in 12 months. 

You cannot blowout results and also burn down the establishment and expect to get long term institutional support. 

Now GameStop can pick and choose who gets the life raft.

The stock price will be unhappy today but in my opinion this is both bullish and leads me to believe that, just like tesla, they‚Äôre about to put a lot of banks in an impossible situation. 

This isn‚Äôt capitalize on share price, this is pick who you want as a new ally. Literally what tesla did."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôve done this so that they can sell those shares at what they see as the peak. They know what‚Äôs coming and they‚Äôre moving themselves into a position they can benefit too. Bullish move
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does that mean they will go from 65 Million available shares to 69 million?

Nice."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just keep a few things to keep in mind here:

1. Gamestop had a stock offering similar to this one they could have used at any time this year, but they never used it. Would have made more sense to use that when the stock was 250+
2. They don't ever have to actually use this if they don't want to. If they do use this then they can still choose which date to issue the new shares--they aren't diluting today.
3. The dilution would be roughly 5% if they issued all the shares. Which would mean a short term drop of \~5% would be reasonable assuming the stock had reason to be at the price point it was at. Any drop larger than 5% is manipulation/overreaction (assuming the previous stock price was reasonable).
4. If Cohen or other board members want/need to buy more stock then this is an easy way to drop the price short term while adding long-term value (whether they issue the shares or not)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The conspiracy theorist in me wants to think they'll do it at the peak of the short squeeze but who knows lol

All I know if my portfolio just took a huge hit"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't be surprised that the HFs will use this opportunity to force the price way down for paper hands to start panic selling. For others, it's another opportunity to buy or decrease the average (me included). Let's see how this plays out"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,this is proof they waiting for the moon to.  selling shares at moon price really would take this company to amzn lvls
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"'K I'm eating crayon but I do get that this is nice on the long term.   


I'd like to know the possible implication for the friking squeeze"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just shat myself then I realised after reading so many negative thoughts that no companies would fuck themselves like this.
And I also believe there is way more shorts than 6% of shares. 

So fuck it I‚Äôll buy the dip AGAIN"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope management buys them for themselves
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like by this point of time gme is a good buy, even if the squeeze don't happens, because it it doesn't matter what they announce, the internet explodes. its like a billion dollar PR budget for the cost of a trainee typing some retard letter and put it online.
if they play it smart, they can use the hype and become amazon for games just because of us retards (and i like it)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My takeaway is that there might be a sweet discount today and the company is in a better position to finance their pivot.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this the dip I've been waiting for?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"too excited and posted in wrong thread, posting on here again

i think this is really bullish

1. share sale will be done from time to time through an ‚Äúat-the-market‚Äù equity offering program"". this means that share sales may be made at market prices prevailing at the time of a sale. I think they are expecting the squeeze soon and want to capitalize on it as they did not set a price for the share sale
2. purpose of share sale is to further accelerate its transformation as well as for further strengthening its balance sheet
3. Also correct me if im wrong, this is share sale from their treasury and not a share issue? which means there's also not as much share dilution"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"On the bright side, 0% chance of bankruptcy now"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fellas....I may have rose colored glasses but I have and do own several businesses.  This announcement is EXACTLY what I would do if I had any inkling that a massive price spike was coming to COVER my ass when I sold and profited majestically from the spike.  It removes the ability for market makers, sec, dtc and anyone else to determine that I have manipulated the market in any way.  Frankly, I see this as EXCELLENT news and will now massively buy the dip...perhaps even double my position.  This is bullish as F IMO."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So at minimum Gamestop says it's looking for $285 a share and at the same time also says that they don't think that's the top by any means by saying they just want to sell shares to bring in $1,000,000,000 by selling **up to** 3.5M shares...so when this thing hits $10k/share they only have to sell 100,000 shares.

So...what I'm hearing is... at BARE MINIMUM Gamestop feels the floor is closer to $300 and we'll likely see higher prices. Got it....sounds like I'll be holding.

üíéüôåü¶ç = üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It looks like a great opportunity to average down from my $390 average!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me get this straight...

GameStop announces they *might* sell *up to* **5%** of their shares ‚Äúfrom time to time‚Äù

\*price immediately drops 16%\*

This is a fire sale, right?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Am I correct in thinking this is a precursor to a share recall? I thought all matters pertaining to share dilution/offering/splits etc had to be voted on?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay i buy more and hold.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,3.5million shares at most against a minimum 10million short ? This changes almost nothing
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,We'll just buy that up
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is like watching children try to do calculus
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dip buy!!  Woohoo
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,can someone explain to the true tards wtf this all means?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs probably unlikely but I wonder if this could bait some of the less exposed shorts to cover and trigger the squeeze
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this the buying opportunity I've been waiting for?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck I want the market to open. Yesterday I could buy around 10 shares and now almost 14. 4 extra stonksüòé
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds to me like a good fucken legal advertisement that they will sell stock when the whole shebang blows and the stock rockets off to the next galaxy.

They sure know how to cover their asses."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a bullish new, plenty of cash for the transformation"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just scooped up one share on the discount. Weird that it‚Äôs down so much, this is great news"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no issues with 3.5 million share dilution, doesn‚Äôt even say when they‚Äôll sell, they‚Äôll probably just diamond hands like us üòÇ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop already over performing and will continue that for long time üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a bear trap. Calling it now. Lookout. Some of the shorts already in position might feast today but the new bears they're sucking in with this are going to be very fuk.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt know what the fuss is all about. The company is doing its best to restructure and transform GameStop to become the Amazon of gaming. 3.5 million shares is nothing if you‚Äôre long and believe in its fundamentals.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So has WSB gone from capitalizing on a short squeeze to actually liking this as a growth stock?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They won‚Äôt let us down. I believe in RC
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR: GameStop set a sell wall @ $285 when the price was $191. BULLISH!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I would gladly trade (up to) 5% in dilution for Ryan Cohen to have a $1B war chest to aggressively expand e-commerce. It's like a cheat code at this point.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The FUD campaign is in full force right now in the media.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Key points: will NOT exceed 3.5M shares AND $1B. They likely planning on selling when the squeeze happens and when they do this is gonna be a drop in the bucket.

Bullish AF üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep reading this as ""Share price will not exceed 1 billion"" üòé"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing about GME compared to say AMC and other meme stocks is they are competently managed and have a decent balance sheet. They bought back stock in 2019-2020 when it was heavily undervalued at $5/share, and now they can sell back a few million shares at $150-$200/share and pickup a ton of operating capital to fund an acquisition and/or speed up their transformation."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Please open as low as possible. I‚Äôm doubling down on the bell
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Proceeds will not exceed $1,000,000,000""

Nice to finally see an official floor price for a share."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,just a nice little sale üöÄ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop asking why is down! READ ! HOLD and IF YOU CAN BUY THE DIP ü¶ç ü¶ç DO NOT PANIC
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It s not like AMC.. amc was issuing new shares... here they are selling  some of their own existing shares s!!! It s different !!to finance!! And it s not today it in the next future , up to 3.5 mln shares for a max of 1 billion dollars!! So max 1mln shares at 1k or 500k at 2k... DON T PANIC!!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is an over reaction, a 5% ""potential"" dilution doesn't warrant a 15%+ drop. Not to mention how much a cash infusion would help the company (not that they are hurting for cash). This is a non event."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are not new shares!!! So it s not a diluition!! THEY ARE NOT NEW SHARES!! are shares that they have on the balance sheet and want to cash out .. no debt it s an intelligent move!! So when the price will pop up, they will sell some of their shares for a maximum of 1 billion.. so they can sell also max of 1mln shares at 1k!!!!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is nothing ppl
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"CAN sell up to 3.5 million shares IF they need it to accelerate transformation and strenghten balance sheet. SMALL increase in outstanding amount of shares, and I have no doubt in my mind that retail own more then 73 million shares combined. Would only need 500.000 of us with 146 shares each to own the float, and when GME is the most bought stock ALL AROUND THE WORLD by apes, don\`t fall for the FUD, they want to cover for as LOW as possible, but if none of us want to sell before the **price is right** it doesn\`t really matter what the stock goes to before the squeeze."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I say, 

BRING ON THE VOLATILITY ü¶çüíé"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've seen so many other DDs explaining the ""At The Money"" quote from the article.  Gamestop can now benefit greAPEly from the upcoming MOASS!  ü¶çüñçüöÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,maybe it's just a way to get another big whale / investor on board :) might just be strategic.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This was in the sec filing.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought 6 more
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So yeah, one time.  3.5 million shares max.  And they could sell some, or none (which is what they did all of last quarter even though this same prospectus was on file)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine them having a balance sheet flush with cash... this is good long term.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,We can use this volatility to cause the rocket! BUY NOW!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"We all knew this was going to happen eventually. I take this as a very positive development. I'm sure papa Cohen has some really exciting initiatives for the company which requires substantial capital. Instead of taking on more debt, they will sell some shares at market prices to fund the resurrection of Gamestop. Don't sweat this Boyz... üöÄüöÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,shitting my pants looking at my P/L
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a GOOD thing. 3.5M shares is nothing. That capital is going to accelerate GameStop's growth. BULLISH
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally old news üòÇ so GME one day in the distant future might have a flor of 80m shares? But there‚Äôs still 200m - Thats 120m above this - shorted/FTD‚Äôs üòÇ

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This tells me that they will sell these during the squeeze to generate profit from the shorties being short cause they will have to be bought. Unless I am mistaken, I do eat crayons so that is something else to consider."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Paper hands time!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They want to be able to offer the shares at a price of $6942069. Bullish
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GME website told us days before that Monday a 50% sale will come.. Lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,M&A üöÄüöÄüöÄ

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone find any goodies in prospectus? They acknowledged the ‚Äúshort squeezes‚Äù, implying more than one, and has it listed first in the risk factors"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"People seem to be overlooking the part of this release that says GME is relocating their headquarters to Moonbase City, Location Moon.

Seems like the  insiders know something!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its a good move for GME. They need the warchest. Not sure they needed to announce it now, could have done it along with a full plan of where they were going to spend it and timelines. Would have become a booster vs now when it causes fear."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's so cool to see the life we put back into gamestop. The fact that monkeys saved a company is so cool.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is anyone else extremely concerned about this? Won't this dilute all our hard work and drop the share price? Thoughts?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is bullish AF. They're basically confirming that they believe the stock price will rise dramatically and they're reserving the the right to sell a few shares and raise $1bn when it does, which will help to accelerate their transition into a e-commerce powerhouse. This was fucking perfectly played, imo."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you would give Ryan Cohen a billion dollars to invest for you, you should like this stock more now than ever."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course they will issue shares. When have they had such interest? How many apes will buy? How long til the moon now?

Just another company making what they can, fuck everyone else. Nothing to see here."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Still learning to read, does it basically mean ""We're informing Apes that we'll be joining them on their mission to the moon"".  Also, ""Here's some more tickets.""

Sounds good to me! Welcome aboard! :D"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,20 mil is floor apesüåöüôàüöÄüíé
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,the hedgies have sold way too many high premium options to allow the stock price to trade anything but flat this week. They will ensure those all expire worthless before they stop stepping on the order flow and taking reverse positions. We will see a week of 190s before they unwind those positions and the stock rises again.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The misinformation regarding this confirms to me how desperate the HFs are.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dilution
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"1,000,000,000 / 3,500,000 = $285.71 per share."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"1,000,000,000/3.5m is 285 average per share. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the intent. I think they want some of that tasty squeeze."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is this move NOT fucking us though?

Lol only on wsb and r/politics do questions get you downvoted."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is good. They will be able to sell some when it sky rockets to 10,420,069.69 and capitalise on the squeezey mcsqueeze"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder what percentage of current shareholders read this and actually realize that this makes their shares LESS valuable.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How many new shares do y‚Äôall think GME needs to issue before the short squeeze story is dead?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So with all of the potential new developments, Ryan Cohen's vision, ex amazon executives, you thing the price will plummet from what it is now all the way back to 26-30 range?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here's a view from someone who is on your side, but doesn't look at this through rose-colored glasses...

If the current price is based on shorts getting squeezed, then issuing new shares will give the shorts an easier exit.  Less squeezability = somewhat bearish.

If the current price is based on GME's ability to completely transform itself into some kind of online behemoth, then the price impact will depend on the skill of the management team to get a return on the newly acquired capital that exceeds what the market demands to justify the current price.  Could be bullish or bearish depending on your belief in the team.  Market gives their view first, then over time reality gives the final answer in the form of profit statements."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The rocket ship just became a guided missing headed straight down. 

Anticipate a selling spree upon market open. 

This is exactly what destroyed Hwang, when Viacom announced a new offering, diluting the stock."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,wtf were holding and theyre selling?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So it's over... oh well
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"L O L

Get fucked GME retards."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What exactly does this mean though? ELI5?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Baffling the amount of denial of GME ""investors"" to a stock dilution.  The excuses to spin this off as a positive thing is just plain wild.  Any veteran trader or has worked in investment field knows news like this is just plain bad news for existing investors.  The blind ignorance to this stock is both commendable and hilarious at the same time.  GME can do no wrong."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope it goes below 130 so I can average down
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"**Do some math.** 

""In no event will the Company sell more than 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock under the ATM Offering, and aggregate gross proceeds will not exceed $1,000,000,000.""

1 billion proceeds max  
3.5 million shares max

1MM / 3.5M = $285.71 per share  

Looks like GME wants to get in on the squeeze themselves.

Bullish AF."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure why this is bullish news for GME but bearish for AMC...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Nooooo why‚Äôs it at 170 again!! I was looking forward to doubling down @ 150
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"A quick note, 1B cash would be 3.5m shares at avg 285$"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah.... So they are fucking us. Got it
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This enables GME to be a lifeline to short sellers in the case that the squeeze actually occurs.

In other words, if a squeeze does occur, GME will come to the rescue and allow short sellers to cover via new shares issued by GME.

So, for all those who are just sitting around waiting for a squeeze, a big chunk of your expected profits just vaporized."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,...didnt gamestop announce they were still over 100% shorted during the most recent phone call thing? Hedgies are fuck
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So they wont be looking to sell till 285 right? Whys everyone so worried now?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Just bought 100 shares. We need to get about 5k off the market this morning. buy and hold
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"guys anyone panicking. STOP it

3.5m shares is a joke, will not make a big impact on action price.

think about amc planning to double the shares. that's bad"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,3.5M is nothing and people are going nuts.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao this isn't new, simply renewed filings. If they didn't take advantage in December, why would they take advantage now?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I sent their investor relations an E-mail back in Januruary with exactly this idea. Almost the same numbers and phrasing to. I am happy they are doing it.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me to people panicking over this: Lawl. This is good news, apes, not bad. Chiiiill."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The üåàüêªcrowd is trying to spin this like it's a bad thing or we're getting diluted. This is money used for transforming a ship into a space ship cuz we're only going to the freaking üåï with it. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüíéüëê
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Business is business. There are no friends

It will not be the value we hoped for. The value we seek is based on forcing the shorts to cover. If they could have found a private investor for those shares, we would be a step closer. Today is a great day to buy and hold.."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm betting it will go down to $130 at least. My opinion. Not advice.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a call it like I see it! GME selling shareas while us Apes are holding to the fucking bitter will be like a slap in the face!üñï
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So it begins.  Gamestop is cashing out.  12 months till bankruptcy boys.  Trust me. Know when to get out.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"this really pisses me off, why didn't they force the shorts to close before selling"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Meaning GME has its own price target of $285/share 

(1B/3.5m)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck GME and Ryan Cohen. They could have recalled all shares to do this. Instead they are just ossueing more. Which will be gobbled up by institutions and hedgies. 

This is not in our (the shareholders') best interest at all."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Down 17% already
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It took them forever to do this a bit too late and I think partially why their cfo was kicked out.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"How sure are we that this isnt the executives at GME riding us out of bankruptcy to then fuck us over for a nice bonus?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's normal for a company to have this option in the open. Ryan Cohen is helping the MOASS from the inside, don't worry."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What if the 3.5 all go to Cohen (and other execs) then they all recall their shares (that would fill some naked shorts) forcing the MOASS to happen and them all making an absolutely insane killing for themselves and the company as well. ü§î
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is obciously a bailout compromise.

im 100% sure they had talks with the government etc for weeks to be able to do this without going to jail cuz it sensitive."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will be a bad move under the current situation and anyone on the board of the company will know that by a fact. - After coming back from near (Bankruptcy created by the people against the company ) Thanks to the millions of new investors, reaching levels of 340+ per share from 10+ a share, It will be a bad move to sell more shares. They better first let anyone who bet against the company ( put that money into the company) then rest for a while until the real price of the share stablished and then if its worth sell more share. Either way, its not worth for them in the current state to do that, if so they can go again to their first state (bankruptcy) by now new investors selling all their shares (it will be a suckers move from the company)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol this one ain't got a lot of up votes.  Hmmm. Wonder why...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn‚Äôt go to math school or nothin, but 3.5 million shares with max proceeds being $1 billion would be an average sale price of $285/share."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,bullish
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,To make 1B the price has to be at $285 so I guess this is bullish

in effort to shake diamond hands"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,ahh diluting
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamestop offering is the best thing they can do. Raise Capital without screwing share holders (5%). Check this out  https://youtu.be/-C-Le_J61kw
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,lol so much denial in this thread.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Down 31$ what kind of backstabbing is this ??? I‚Äôve been holding and buying to help GME squeeze and in return Ryan just started back stabbing!
WTF?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guys,  THEY CANNOT SELL SHARES WITHOUT DOING A RECALL & RECOUNT, so adds another technical way for us to recall shares from shorts."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"How much is 1,000,000,000..dumb ape trying to count"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why offer 3.5 million shares now... wby not after the squeeze when everyone has millions and billions vs thousands and hundreds thousands. When you have billion a million seems small.  Now multiply that by 300 hard-core GME fans out of the ~300k in here.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"End of the game, back to reality."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Based on the info they are not going to sell until gme traded above $280 level to get 1 billion do no need to panic now
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So they cap gains at $1,000,000,000 with 3,500,000 shares. At Max, each of the 3,500,000 shares can be sold at $285,714.28 per share to hit the $1,000,000,000. GME just told us what to sell our shares at."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,does this mean the squeeze is called off ? dont know how many shares are still shorted
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GME are gonna cash out those 3.5 mil at market open like there's no tomorrow. Gamestop is thinking they better get that bag now than gamble for it to ever be 300$ in fantasy land.

Does this mean that they will be offering 3,5 million X times?

Or they will offer shares X times up to 3.5 million shares?"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,why would they want to do this?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like retail is about to buy that up too and own a larger percent of the company lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure they already announced something like this in dec-Jan.  Now it looks like they filed so they can pull the trigger when needed. 

Imma hold.  At least better numbers for the next quarter"

Of course, I'm not exactly sure what they can really do to improve the company going forward, short of complete re-invention of their business.  Brick and mortar gaming is just dead as a concept.  I think the writing's on the wall even for brick and mortar board gaming, what with things like boardgamearena.com and the like."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,4 shares bought at 168. Thx for the dip RC <33. As long as i'm averaging down I am happyyyyy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Theyre looking at an avg of 285 per share there, just saying."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GME May have figured out that they can make shares whenever they want so they can sell them during the squizzle ü•¥
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this a good news ? I‚Äôm stupid retard pls explain
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did mention an intent to sell some shares at some point in their [Form-10k](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638021000032/gme-20210130.htm).  

Anyway, I guess this is what's causing the slump in the pre-market."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So they were too afraid to sell shares under the old authorization so they're just going to go 6 times larger because now they aren't afraid?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dilution
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,3.5m bananas for apes
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They just updated the December offering from $100 MM to $1,000 MM..."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"HERE WE GO, HOLD THE FCKNG LINE üöÄüöÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They wanted to sell stock in January to pay off debt but their lawyers advised against it because the current price was too overvalued. Sitting around $175ish for like a month now must make it acceptable to sell stock. They have been chompin at the bit for this moment. Still well above fair value so they are probably stoked
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short term this may result in a drop because of supply and demand, but think of the bigger picture.

This subreddit's activism got a company on the brink of bankruptcy to pull itself up, and their stock price is high enough this issuing will fetch them enough capital to restructure.

It's exactly the kind of thing Blockbuster *could* have used when they went bankrupt.  They were trying to restructure to a streaming platform to compete with Netflix and well... then the Great Recession happened."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So theoretically they should drop about 8% if the market is efficient?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would expect them to sell at any price >= $175. The Jeffries price target is most likely a result of legal concerns about selling stock that your own research department values at $15 so far above that number.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying the dip
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck does this mean for our stock guys? Just added more at $170 then saw they were offering shares. What does this mean?? üòÇüòÇ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"FFS, they are now ALLOWED to issue a MAXIMUM of EITHER 3.5 million shares OR 1 billion dollars worth of shares. 

Public companies are not ever allowed to issue infinite shares, no matter what they file. Y‚Äôall are smoother brained than even I thought."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This 100% shows they believe it would go much higher or they would of sold shares at the 400s imo. No matter when they sell it won't affect the float more than 9% meaning it doesn't hurt the squeeze at all. 3.5 million sharea or 1 bil dollars max. Leaves gme one hell of a war chest and ultimately raises the floor of share price for after squeeze.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ctrm?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So 100 shares at the top...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is bullish AF.  They updated their old option to sell ATM (which they never exercised) from 6m shares down to only 3.5m shares.  And increased the dollar amount from $100,000,000 cap to $1,000,000,000 cap.  They know the value of the stock has and is increasing and setting up to milk it for as much money with as little impact to the shares/company as possible.  GOOD MOVE, TEAM."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is good for the company long-term but does make a squeeze less likely.

They're only adding a few percent to the float, not talking about more than doubling it like AMC wants to."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So is this good or bad for us
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the stock prices increase to $250 or $300, there would be considerably fewer shares needed to be released to hit the $1b limit"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,At the very least maybe we get a new discount! I love sales!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry guys, they gonna sell after the peak.  GME is Diamond Hands."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uncle Bruce gets his wish.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,my body is ready

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It means: $285.71/share ($1 billion / 3.5 million) **is the new bottom price!**

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They need to provide enough stocks for short sellers to buy can the grow to 1000 per share.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If its good for everybody im happy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"*Gross proceeds will not exceed $1,000,000,000*

All that means is that during the squeeze, they would like to sell 7 or 8 shares..."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a whole lot of words for my ape brain to comprehend...can I get a TL;DR
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like someone is telling the shorts its time to get out and that they could possibly provide a relief valve if things get too heated.  Taking the money directly from the people trying to screw them... i love it.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in we hold they‚Äôll sell 1 share for 1 million

NICE"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn't this increase in float significantly reduce the probability of a squeeze? But you just like the stock dont you hmmmmmmmmmm
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's good for them is good for GME holders. This will increase the value of the company and your shares will be worthy of investing long term,  and not just a play on the market."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is $285 a share is a discount? Sounds about right.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Super bullish üíéüôå
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,$1B with 3.5mil= avg price target $285
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"My question is, after all this is finished and GameStop comes out on top....will they finally give us fair cash returns for trading in used games???"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They will obviously sell this at the highest price possible there‚Äôs so much volume in this stock we probably won‚Äôt even notice the selling of 3.5million shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, retards - get ready to buy the real shit, some actual shares. (I'd love to have clearing directly with them instead of a untrusted clearing company)"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"3.5 million shares? If I understand that correctly,  that's still less than the number held by any of the top ten institutional owners. I've seen institutional ownership listed between 90-110M shares (out of 70M total) which means they're proposing to issue a number of shares that is less than 1/6, possibly even 1/8 the number of institutionally owned minus total shares."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking Jeffries... This has the potential to completely tank the stock (hedgies will use it as an excuse to short attack it). Let's see which companies are willing to load up on shares at current prices.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,And I thought AMC was the one diluting there shares.  LOL.    AMCüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,We‚Äôre fucked
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They are issuing half the shelf offering shares (5+mil) for 10x the cap. How is that not a sign of them expecting the squeeze to happen soon?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's fud... they had this since December and haven't used it.

And if they do use it it will be used positively in my uneducated opinion not like amc used to pay ceo"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How does this coincide with the DTCC rule? Like hedgies cant spam options abuse then ryan Cohen hand feeds a bunch of apes and whales?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Max 3.5m shares and max 1b dollars = $285 share average. I guess they expect it to go above that if they‚Äôre to sell some at the current price initially. I‚Äôd see a small dip at most from this (buying opportunity) and then a swing back up through the 300s. This is just valuation based , idk how it might affect the squeeze."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome. Let them in on the squeeze I say!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"From what I understand, they only updated the offering they filed back in december from $100,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 with no timeframe attached. They could offer at the height of the moass and and truly be a drop in the bucket as far as number of shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In order to reach 1Billion in sales on 3.5 Milling shares, the average price needs to be at 285ish. They are really expecting it to go up  

# üöÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly it is not much. It's just 3.5 mil compared to a 40 mil float.

We still have 110% institution ownership and around 20% insider share ownership lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So GameStop already had the right to sell up to 6mil shares for up to $100,000,000 since December, then üíéüôå through February and now reduces the max numbers of shares they want to sell but increases the amount of money they want to get from it drastically.

Bullish AF."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,bullish.  Gimme more shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Switch to amc?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing like some good old fashioned share dilution.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This was in their filling they are scaring you they will sell share at $250 price to make 1bil
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"3.5 million shares x $1,000,000 is a minimum of 3.5 trillion. Not sure about their math. This is a minimum"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚Äúto up to $1,000,000,000, but in no event more than 3,500,000 Common Shares, pursuant to the Company‚Äôs existing Open Market Sale AgreementSM (the ‚ÄúSale Agreement‚Äù) with the Sales Agent dated December 8, 2020.‚Äù

So basically what this means that theyre still selling the 500million shares but now will add 3.5million to that but no more"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúThe ATM Offering will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale of all Common Shares subject to the Sale Agreement or (2) termination of the Sale Agreement.

Basically, the dilution of these shares have no expiration date and can go on as long as they milk it to $0 thus draining all the money from retails pocket and into their own"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They want part of the squeeze tendies.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not that the old one expired, it's that they filed a new one to allow themselves to raise more money than before. The reduction in shares from 6 to 3.5 million is likely just due to the higher price. Keep in mind the old ATM offering allowed for raising a max of $100 million, this is 10x that amount."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this. I‚Äôm a lawyer, though not yours, and seeing a bunch of internet idiots claim that the company will be issuing 3.5 million shares as a block multiple times has been driving me crazy. 

This is bullish af news."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not worried at all about this, I‚Äôm actually glad GameStop is taking advantage of raising some capital. Even if they did sell the whole 3.5 million shares, it‚Äôs *nothing* towards shorts being covered."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"And it gets Cramer off this topic,  this was the last thing really holding Cramer back from becoming full pro-gme"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"From one point of view, it's them doing the necessary pre-informing that they intend to sell, being insiders. If you like confirmation bias, some might say they're preparing to make good on the squeeze themselves. It's really just speculation, but if I were in their shoes and believed in the squeeze (they probably can see some things we can't), I'd want to be in on it, too, if I could."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"120% short to 28% short, what squeeze?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The DTCC itself could report the short interest was 0% and you guys would still be ignoring all the signs.

RIP the squeeze.

Edit: Yeah drive this comment into the ground, if you do the squeeze is still on."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Even if they did the offering 3.5 million shares is 5% of the float. That's just a drop in the bucket for what needs to be covered
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They may offer 3.5 million ""FROM TIME TO TIME"" 

so they'll do it whenever is fitting"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs true but it‚Äôs usually a formality. Tesla always says the same thing when they issue 5B in shares and they end up issuing the full amount within a week

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So this means they will be selling shares whenever they want and probably divided over the coming months?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I suspect that RC will wait and sell during the squeeze to minimize dilution
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like December when they did nothing with it. Not news really.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Its all good. Same shit happened to amc last week about the potential for 500Mil shares to be added. Doesnt mean it WILL just means it CAN happen. Bye bye paper hands

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you have a link to that?

Just curious, not discrediting. I think this is a smart move on their part and shows they think that GME minimum price is $285/share."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> They had an old offering agreement with the ability to offer 6 million shares that has expired. 

No. That's not true. It was 100 million worth when the stock price was at 16.6, thats why that was 6 million shares at the time. The new terms are much better for them to capitalize on the squeeze and ape stupidity."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC hasn't issued shares? Where are you getting that information?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This sounds really bad actually. Gme knows the stock price is overvalued so they're selling. Not good in the slightest
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothings been issued yet boi
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Some would say that $285 is actually the min value per the text
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They're just making sure they can cash in with us on the squeeze. It's  sensible move IMO.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not how supply and demand works, it'll just keep driving the price lower and lower. There isn't gonna be a squeeze, it's super good for them company wise but people are gonna be realllllly upset when gme finally goes back to a normal price and they'll be stuck holding shares at 200%"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I think this stock dilution will cause a large drop in the short term but is a great investment in the long term.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, it's a fairly illiquid hour. Considering this move strengthens the company it's goes into the plus column. Bear in mind Ryan Cohen who chairs the financing task force is also a large shareholder and wouldn't make such a decision lightly. I expect him to buy more shares, bit well see."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"BTFD, they had a standing ability to sell up to 6 million shares, which expired. If anything this should make the price go up because they can't sell as many shares as they could a month ago."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No it‚Äôs not. This was announced in 2020 üòÇ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really that important, but the mods shouldn't be deleting it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. Considering that most of the board will rotate out in the summer I expect the current CEO Sherman to leave and be replaced by Cohen. By late summer the latest we'll have a well capitalized company with a new strategy run by big brains with a track record of excellence from Chewy and Amazon.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. This is a tiny dilution and lots of cash for the company. This is awesome. They have no debt to pay off so imagine trying to short a company with more than a billion cash on hand for expansion. Disaster for shorts. Dilution to little to cover with (at market price no less) and company expanding.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. $600,000,000 of play money for Cohen and new amazon exec to get the internet/tech side of the business going.

This injection will rapidly accelerate their turn around plan. When Elon did an offering like this and said he was gonna build another gigafactory, the stock actually went up looool."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, tiny dilution, from time to time , and only up to 1bil. Can't wait for the FUD to spread how this gonna be the end tho."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, this has to be one of the most bullish things yet. If I wasn't already all in I'd be buying more at this sweet discount."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some solid DD, thanks for pointing out they had one of these filed all last quarter.  Definitely looking good for GME"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Should be top comment.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> If Cohen or other board members want/need to buy more stock then this is an easy way to drop the price short term while adding long-term value (whether they issue the shares or not).

The board represents the shareholders, ie. the owners of the company. It is not legal for them to ""drop the price"" so they can benefit at shareholders' expense.

However I see in this thread that any bearish signal is actually really really bullish. The price dropping is actually a great thing because it allows us to buy more shares. The best would be if it went to nearly zero, I would load up! So, if it ends up that the company is entirely owned by apes, and what they want is a huge dip so they can buy more of what they entirely own, then I don't see why the board couldn't give them that. For some in this sub, if the company issued unlimited shares that would be ideal, because the share price has nothing to do with the value of the company divided by number of shares, it has a price target of $1M regardless of number of shares or any nerd math.

I suspect that there is no event so bearish that it would turn everyone in this sub off of the stock. The company goes bankrupt? ""Guys this is actually bankruptcy *protection*, which means they're protected from paying back everyone they owe. This completely frees up the board to get to work on mooning the stock! They're filing for bankruptcy not because they need to, but because they have really bullish plans!"" The company gets delisted? ""Guys this is actually a good thing. It means it's now technically impossible for the shorts to get their hands on my shares! I actually do get to keep them forever!"""
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If price drop would be only 5%, why is it dropping +15% now? I don't get finances.."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,lol yeah i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre announcing this entire plan just so they can decide to never execute it...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,5. They wouldnt issue this news knowing full well it will impact this once in a lifetime situation with their stock just to not use it. Take the bad news now and expect them using it.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Proceeds are limited to $1 billion, so that wouldn't be many shares. Barely any dilution."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It makes the squeeze less likely. Not saying it can't happen, but it'll be harder. Any time you're adding shares to the float, you're making it easier for shorts to cover if they need to.

Especially considering short interest actually isn't crazy high right now, any potential squeeze would be less painful."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,why did you read mind
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's like someone is playing ""make a e-commerce videogame company"" on very easy-mode."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,A dip on some ‚Äòbad news‚Äô is probably HFs trying to make us panic thinking people are selling.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"at-the-market offering =/= share dilution.

this will have little to no impact on the share price unless of course some apes are actually retarded and don't know how this works and panic sell.

just another thing to skim off the left over paper hands."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also agree it‚Äôs bullish, but I‚Äôm not sure you are right with your first point? As I understand, it doesn‚Äôt matter what price is above $285 as at $285 they get 1 billion from 3.5 million shares. After this point it doesn‚Äôt matter what price they sell their shares at, because they will raise the same amount of money ($1 billion). So it doesn‚Äôt matter if they sell 3.5 million at $285 or 1 million at 1000, they will end up raising the same capital....

What it does also show is that they probably expect the price to increase to ATLEAST 285, as that‚Äôs when they can get the full benefit. However, I believe for them, any price higher than 285 makes no difference as they are capped by how much money they can raise, and not by the shares they can offer. Basically:

IF PRICE UNDER $285: 1 billion dollars can never be reached. Too few shares

IF PRICE OVER $285: 1 billion dollars can be reached regardless of price.

One thing I am not sure is if the total shares offered is 3.5 million, or if it‚Äôs a max of 3.5 million ‚Äûper offering‚Äú which means they can end up pumping in 70 million shares via 20 offerings. But I am not sure and maybe someone can help answer or clarify that!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a good point. Investing into the longevity of the business basically.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> So at minimum Gamestop says it's looking for $285 a share

more like they are saying at a maximum they are seeing that value. Anything higher and they can only sell $1b worth. At that price or Any lower and they can sell up to 3.5M shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not how Treasury shares work. They're shares that were previously bought back by the company that will be reissued, which does increase the float."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right that it's not making up new shares. It still dilutes the float a bit, same as if paper hands would sell 3.5M shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't say it hurts significantly. The dilution is minimal. If the underlying thesis of how much this is shorted is correct, such a small dilution will barely have any effect."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, it does not.  A lot of smooth brained apes out this Morning.

Have some patience.  It is not squeezing today."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesn‚Äôt hurt the squeeze potential at all. If the shorts really have covered and are only 20% of the float, than there is no squeeze potential, and the 800,000 words of DD is wrong. 

If the 800,000 words of DD is right, the shorts are at somewhere between 200-900% of the float, and a up to 5% of the float share issuance does nothing to that. 

This is bullish as fuck. This is the proverbial ‚Äúdip‚Äù that the rich people buy and the poor people panic and sell."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Its not additional shares. They want to be able to sell some when they price spikes up.

But keep in mind they will not take more than 1 Bil in total.  So could be anything from all 3.5 million shares at $285/each, 1,000 shares at $1mil/each, etc.

They just are ensuring tickets on the rocket as well."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Recalling shares would do absolutely nothing to make the shorts cover. This is definately in the shareholders interest. 1 billion in cash would be amazing. The transformation to e-commerce will go much faster and the shares will be worth much more on fundamentals alone when that is done! Also its not a big dilution so the shorts are still screwed
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You understand nothing about the situation so stop blabbering. GME can not issue a share recall

i borrow desk is still showing that its cheap to short as well: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

1.2% APR fee supports the idea that its not over shorted atm."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it? What's the outstanding short situation look like right now?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true If you mean they will do that same amount more than once
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Upvoted for context.

But wouldn't this put RC under the threshold for ownership based on common stock?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme had the ability to offer shares before this as well. 100m worth and they never used it. I have doubts that RC would approve this and dilute himself for no reason.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lot of people diluting themselves into believing that Gamestop is more concerned about the potential for another short squeeze than they are about running their own business.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not Tesla, and they are not issuing shares.  
It just gives GME the possibility to sell some of the shares they have locked away."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not if we sold puts üòé
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They renewed the filing and increased the max proceeds to $1b.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúIn no event will the Company sell more than 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock under the ATM Offering, and aggregate gross proceeds will not exceed $1,000,000,000‚Äù"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They could have issued stock before and did not. All this new filing does is allow them to better take advantage of the squeeze when the time comes.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they wanted to capitalize on the price as soon as possible, it would have been December to March 31st.  The larger offering was for 6.1 million shares . Previous Offering: [86b3d579-3e5c-411a-8a4e-bb96f25c2e46 (gamestop.com)](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/86b3d579-3e5c-411a-8a4e-bb96f25c2e46)

The new filing is a reducing the ATM offering from 6.1 million shares to 3.5 million shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not realistic at all seeing that they had opportunities already when it peaked in January and also the run up in Feb. This is just refreshing their stance on it with different numbers.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Price target of $285.

1,000,000,000 / 3,500,000 = price per share"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm thinking it also would reduce their credit risk on any low amount,  short term borrows"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,*when* the squeeze happens;)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They will sell directly to shorts at the price Ryan Cohen so desires
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry man but by any sight Bloomberg or otherwise, a short squeeze ain't there. Gamma squeezing is your only hope"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What price do you think they‚Äôre targeting? I bet it‚Äôs less than 4 figures
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119312521105564/d160986d424b5.htm

Look at bullet point 2 - they previously filed this in December but sold no stock.  They just renewed and raised max value because the stock is a lot more valuable now."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Capping proceeds doesn't mean they have a share price target.  It just means they won't raise more than that amount. If they have a share cap as well that sets a floor on the share price to maximize proceeds.  However, this does not mean they can't sell shares at a lower or higher price."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,More like maximum cuz they would sell at that price... it means they think their share price is overvalued
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"to coincide with a manufactured (120k share) relatively cheap dip...ahh, they think we're so dumb."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,1 bill max. Sooo.. they‚Äôre gonna sell 1 share at the peak. *bery spook*
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Short data is completely false though. Most of it is hidden and unreported.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This sub is operating like CCP, any negative news/analysis gets disappeared"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They did
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Some would say thats crazy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You must have misread it. 285 is very clearly the MAX they'd sell each share for (1,000,000,000 / 3,500,000 = 285)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sad boi, get some sleep intern bro. Papa Melvin is fucked  anyway."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,But they have a cap at the max number of shares based on the filing. The post you are responding to suggests the max value they could sell at to sell all the new shares would be $285. Any higher than that and they cannot sell the entire 3.5M shares. Lower they can only sell up to 3.5M shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The apes are in force today. Don‚Äôt worry about the downvotes- the sane and normal people of this sub like us laugh at these apes
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. These retards are in for a whole lotta disappoint
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn't he have to buy more shares by a certain date?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bear in mind, more like bull in mind"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I for one will be loading up today. 30 needed for 250 share's.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Bear in mind

Reported for being bearish. Also this isn't the first time gme dropped from 190 to 170 in the premarket and stayed that way."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha he said bear....
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I remember when AMC announced more shares and it was good for the stock price. Oh wait....
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop as a company is turning around but it isn't nearly worth $200 a share as a company. This current valuation is completely based off the squeeze so this is extremely negative.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are multiple ways to raise money, they could‚Äôve issued bonds - that would signal that they think they‚Äôre in good enough shape to pay back the proceeds at maturity. You don‚Äôt need to pay back common shares"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They'll need to raise more.  My guess is 1-2 billion more to have the runway to be a serious ecommerce play.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I just came.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,what if it's just the newly appointed executives and CR buying...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How many SHORTS you think are still not covered
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"When Tesla did it he didn't have to worry about emotional retail investors only thinking about a squeeze though. He also had a clear plan on what and why they were doing it. GME basically said ""We're moving into eCommerce, here are a bunch of shares"", but what does that mean? Does that mean Gamestop prices? Or are they trying to be competitive with Amazon's prices?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Because of the size of the dilution.  GME is doing a 5% extra shares while AMC is doing over 100% extra shares.  3.5 million shares of GME compared to 500 million share of AMC.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You can compare 2 events technically without comparing 2 events fundamentally.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that comment was a bunch of meaningless fluff lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, watching people twist every piece of news to make it fit their narrative is crazy. This isn't good for a 'squeeze' in any sense. Sure it will help grow GME but this isn't a tesla scenario."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"3.5 Mill shares is not a lot. Yes it will dilute the shares, but the company will have money to grow. When the company grows, the stock price will follow."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, please - this is not them fucking you. They cannot torch the banks and then do well. 

The squeeze is not squoze.

Do what you do with your money I‚Äôm not encouraging anything. I‚Äôve put a lot of time into this and this is not them fucking you. 

Nobody said tesla fucked them after their first raise in feb 2020. (They did at the moment just like you understandable) but GameStop has to be a participant in the market not absolutely destroy it.

The short hedge funds suck and will die, but the banks don‚Äôt deserve to die too. GameStop cannot just torch everything. They are ‚Äúat-the-market‚Äù so they can get allies - they choose who to save."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention he's only accounting for them doing it *once* and not ""time to time"" like they said.

Also they are selling shares not issuing them unless I read the post wrong? 

Really wish I could hear an unbiased analysis of this move."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also that's not a stock dilution, just dilution of the float. It won't change the ""fundamentals"" price per stock the way an equity emission would."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"because the pool is small in pre market, it doesnt necessarily reflect the while picture which is regular market hour."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They announced a stock offering December last year when the price was below 40. They never used that stock offering and they don't have to use this one either if they don't want to.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They announced a stock offering December last year when the price was below 40. They never used that stock offering and they don't have to use this one either if they don't want to. Also see point #4.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Monofolio xD
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh sure it is.  Have to organize all the different purchase lots!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How can you have a trading competition when you only hold ONE stock!!  **Cries**.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They can also sell 1m shares at $1k for 1b
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not true, they can sell less shares to reach the total. Share ceiling is $1b"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So they only have to sell a 100 shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So only 100 shares then?!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sike,  they're going to cash that out during the squeeze"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why ? I‚Äôm no financial expert but it doesn‚Äôt sound like they sold them on the spot or that the amount of artificial shares are the same. I‚Äôve seen 9-10+ M shares shorted

3.5 ‚Äúup to‚Äù ‚Äúwhen they want‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sound like it"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope people 'panic sell' all the way back to $40. Then see what happens.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Plenty of pre market apes panic selling
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think your logic is backwards...

3.5M shares sold @$285 would be $1,000,000,000. That's the amount they're trying to raise with this sale.

They are allowed to sell *up to* 3.5M shares to raise that $1,000,000,000. If they sell shares for <$285 then they do not raise that $1,000,000,000 they want to use for restructuring.

If they sell shares above the $285 price they don't have to sell as many shares to raise the $1,000,000,000. If, for example, the share price goes to $1,000 they only need to sell 1,000,000 shares. 

It's in their best interest to sell as few shares as possible. So the higher the price goes the fewer shares they have to sell to raise that $1,000,000,000. Selling for anything under $285 won't get them that money, they can't just sell more to hit that goal."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont dispute that, but they can choose when to sell, they dont have to dump it all at once, and its not even happening today"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm reading on this thread.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,...What do you think happens when they sell those shares? More shares on the market = bigger float = less chance for short squeeze
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Nervous jittery traders are never profitable in the long run.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What is your definition of a paper hand?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I read it as diluting share price
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Squeeze-cult: This is terrible news.

People that actually like the stock and company: This is great news."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If there are more shares interested in selling, that eases the pressure on a short squeeze.  I don't think this statement is the least bit controversial.  I'm not saying ""there won't be a squeeze"", just that having more shares available to sell reduces the upside of a squeeze somewhat.  If your GME thesis is ""short squeeze comin', I don't care about the fundamentals"" then this news is a negative for you.  If your thesis is ""I like the stock, it's a great brand, turnaround comin'"" then you are likely happy, but it remains to be seen exactly what GME will do with the money, whether this will justify a $13b valuation etc, afaik.

I have no particular view on your claim that the shorts can't cover and must double down.  I do see that the volume in GME is several times the total outstanding shares every day lately, so it doesn't seem like market liquidity would stop them from exiting, naively, to me.  You may know details about the shorting interests that I don't have though."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The whole point of a short squeeze is that the shorts are forced to cover due to margin calls or risk management concerns.  They have no choice but to buy, and this forced purchasing combines with a lack of liquidity to drive the stock price above fair value."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,man
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,In what way does selling 3.5 million shares help our desire of an increased share price?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would settle for just a job. The money doesn't mean much in the long run, and I really need to find work."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,so why did we dip?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course they can. They can pay a dividend of $.01 per share and all shares would need to be recalled for that. Automatic squeeze (if there is still significant short interest....doubt it)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol what? Once they issue the 3.5m shares this week they won't care about short squeeze happening or not. 

The squeeze isn't going to happen if GME keeps flooding the market with more cheap.shares (price just plumetted with this announcement). 

Besides there isn't significant short interest left. They covered when the price dropped to $40. It's so obvious. 

Disclaimer: I'm long GME. Holding shares only since $19."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"As I recall before, correct me if I'm wrong, the shelf offering was limited to $100m before which acted as a bottleneck for how many shares they could produce. This updated filing 10x's that value, massively increasing their power to deflate all squeeze hope."

That's just very common legal jargon for ""whenever they want"""
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,they can max do 3.5 mil if they do it in multiple offerings they would have to split that amount. It doesn't mean they will be able to do several 3.5 million offerings
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Well it's upto 3.5 M shares. Soo I reckon they could do like 500k one month then another at some random point.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This means that they will sell the shares in blocks at any interval that fits their fundraising goals. They will sell up to 3.5m shares unless they raise $1bn with fewer shares, at which point they will not sell anymore. 

They would never consider releasing 3.5m shares multiple times because that makes their stock a less attractive investment due to potential for random 5% dilution."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,correction: may do it multiple times
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you mean they'll sell 3.5mill shares multiple times? Or the max they can sell is 3.5mill shares and they can spread that out from time to time?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can hide shorts with options plays. Essentially HFs can buy/write options.

Buy a deep ITM call, exercise it to give the appearance that you have covered 100 shorts and at the same time you write a call obligating you to deliver 100 shares.

So in the end you are still short 100 shares but you're hiding it and paying a fee to do so. We have no idea how much they've done this but seeing as though they're doing everything they can to push negative gme sentiment we can only imagine that the true SI is still significantly high.

Also, fwiw, SI that sites report can be flawed in many ways based on how they do calculations. Are they calculating based on the 70m float or based on total shares that are out there which can be tens of millions more than 70m because of rehypothycation etc"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not mental gymnastics. The company could have issued 100m worth of shares at any time during the last two squeezes and did not. 

You're kind of slow if you think RC would approve this and dilute himself at any time before the shareholder meeting."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got doubts. 3.5m shares is next to nothing compared to the supposed true SI. If shorts were able to cover at even $200 they would have already. Instead they are stuck hoping gme goes bankrupt lol

I see this as just gme recognizing that they're able to get more money off of less dilution. Remember that they already had a share offering approved from way back that they could have used at any time but didn't. They didn't sell when we were at 350 so idk why they would sell unless we were already mooning."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or it won‚Äôt squeeze at all because the short interest isn‚Äôt as high as you think and shares are diluted. Ya know, the non conspiracy answer."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, RC's gonna release these when it's at a million a share"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its not for no reason. They would generate huge amounts of cash to reinvent their business. 

I think its incredibly na√Øve to think Gamestop is not going to do this. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for them to generate enormous cash to completely revamp their company. 

The narrative that they wont is kinda nuts. I am invested in GME too, but i think the writing is on the wall. 

The only bright spot, is that GME will do it when they have the most value in the share price. SO they might wait for a bit of a squeeze to do so."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs hardly a dilution. 3.5 million shares is so small. GameStop‚Äôs float is INCREDIBLY small to begin with
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a set up to get the Hedgies to double down on the shorts and apes to buy the dip. RC is delivering fuel for the rockets.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"And 100 mill was for up to 6 mill shares.  
Now it's changed to 1000 mill for up to 3.5 mill shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"RC paid something like 100m for his 12% stake.    Sell 1 billion, and he gets around 100-120 mm equivalent of cash equity.  I'm sure he's happy to sell new shares at 22x what he paid for them 5 months ago."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but they couldn‚Äôt do it before announcing earnings
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Gme had the ability to offer shares before this as well. 100m worth and they never used it.

Because the max was 100m worth. Now its 3.5 million shares. Currently worth 6x as much."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,RC needs money to build an online business.  Buying something existing would costs billions.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I had 100 GME to sell Puts on :(
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically they will sell about a hundred shares during the squeeze to hit that billion mark! Sounds good
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They'd obviously prefer to sell less to achieve the same proceeds so as to not dilute their own personal holdings.  1 stock is 1 stock but it could sell for $50 or $200.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically at any moment they could dump 3.5 million shares at any stock price under $285.71 per share. So if the price spikes up says $50-100 it would be advantageous for them to start unloading shares. In all honesty this just strengthens the shorts positions
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao if you actually think this. They are NOT doing this anticipating a squeeze. That is wishful thinking. They are doing it for various reasons but primarily to spit in the faces of retail investors.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but it can also be 1 mill shares at $1000.  
Guess they have to use very conservative numbers when reporting their intentions."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not really how it works, the don't need to sell all 3.5mil.

It's simply a new better contract and they feel confident to increase their profits form share Sales tenfold."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably $500+
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice find - I think this is important for people to see!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah blow this up because people act like it‚Äôs the first time they‚Äôve ever put this option* out there
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I‚Äôm on the road.  This saved me some annoying phone browsing research!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,And lowered max shares sold.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I was gonna be stuck holding some dudes sweaty bag.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Super glad Gamestop told us they were gonna sell 1 share for 1 billion in the near future.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they didn't. Do you mean the May 4th vote?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uhh no, they can sell 1000 shares at $1m each, GME doesn‚Äôt have to sell all 3.5m shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Living with schizo must be hard, if you think there's some fucking big conspiracy my guy you're wrong. People are just greedy, there isn't some fucking campaign to make retail investors sell, they don't give two shit about us. You sound like a complete moron thinking that some interns are being paid for you to sell your three shares."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Also said buy more shares ;)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is trying to double their shares. This is just 6% if the float. Drop in a bucket
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not talking about the stock price, but about the company. I don't care what the stock does in the short run, I want the company to be strong enough to finance whatever Ryan Cohen and his dream team has planned so that the stock can rise in the long run. In the end the company is only worth whatever it can pay out in dividends to shareholders."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Amc's CEO also just took a $20m payday.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's pre-market, volume is low and such news tends to further drain liquidity (i.e. pending orders get pulled) which is why I'm calling it an illiquid hour."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"""so many shares""? volume is at 133k"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure they considered all the options. By they I mean the financing and strategy committee run by Cohen, one of the largest shareholders. Bonds are an option but too much debt results in a low credit rating and provides a date for the shorts to attack (i.e. if debt repayment on date x lowers the available cash by too much, they will short just before the maturity date). Bonds usually have all sorts of terms the debtor has to abide by (you can check out the limiting terms of previous bond issues by Gamestop from the recent 10K). Equity gives the management more leeway in terms of usage of funds and the timeline. Now I'm not Cohen, I didn't build Chewy from the ground up using just 150m in funding. But I trust his business acumen even though I don't like the effect share dilution is having on my portfolio."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't need luck when the shorties need 100m+ shares lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who said they *can't* sell as much as they could a month ago? They've stated multiple times they have no interest in selling shares to help shorts cover. This is basic corporate governance stuff, but at the same time they're tightening the supply of shares.

Dumb money exits because they think ""zomg 3.5 million more shares are coming out!"" while smart money knows that 3.5 is less than 6, so they buy the dip."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just go short it then - it was a renewed atm offering from 6M potential shares (that was never used) to 3.5M. Released with positive news that sales are up 11%. It's climbing back from being down -16%, currently at -11% with an hour and a half to get back to even in the premarket. There was no significant news today, just, for you, ""significant"" price action that occurred with no volume whatsoever."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You Watching it about to go green? Or still clowning around?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Remind me! 3 months.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,lmfao gme was worth more than that before the short wankery as a full brick and mortar store.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So you are short? Positions?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"E-commerce is a solved problem. It doesn't cost $3 billion to launch an e-commerce website. Plenty of ready-made enterprise platforms with deep customization options. Millions, not billions.

How do I know? I've been making websites for the last 20 years. Prior to the ready-made platforms, I made e-commerce solutions from scratch complete with shipping cost calculators and customized payment gateway integrations."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"My bet is they're not pivoting just to copy Amazon for more than the way they do retail.

I'm guessing RC sees the trend in gaming, is competitive and they're going to use their retail locations to become the leader in this space.  Where a local Gamestop's real utility will be less in sales of items and more akin to gaming cafes in South Korea."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is or is not. 

If you look at all stocks, the current situation with GameStop is highly irregular. It makes sense to compare it to similar events in order to have a chance at prediction.

If the offer is fully subscribed within days it shows extreme demand, pre-negotiation.

If that occurs it likely sets a new price floor and results in a series of share price upgrades.

If GameStop cannot fully subscribe or this just sits, then it shows the opposite, and we go down.

I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball but I have a scenario of a highly shorted stock squeezing for a year - Tesla - and I studied every day of it.

I can tell you they oversubscribed instantly on all 3 offerings in 2020. 

If you want a Gme squeeze you want to see that occur now."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"But what if the share price is already way overvalued and the company growing means the real value of the shares should go from $26 to $34, realistically?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Will it lower the amount shares I personally own or just the value of said shares?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotcha thanks
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Aint got time with that
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You can get an ointment for that.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs trolling u. This is a tactic for a share count we need
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn‚Äôt look like it, many apes don‚Äôt even have PM access and on top of that look at the tiny volume on those PM dips"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"My logic is fine. They did not say they wanted to raise $1b, they set that as the top amount they could raise with the offering. Essentially the Limit they put in place with this offering document is $1b or 3.5M shares, whatever happens first. Either limit triggers the end of the agreement terms meaning they cannot sell more shares. So if they sell below $285, the limit is 3.5M shares. if they sell at or above $285 the limit is $1B."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have 100 bananas, when banana prices moon they will sell 6 of their bananas for profit to help transition company.

They are not saying ‚Äúwe will now be selling an additional 6 bananas‚Äù"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"New people on here define it as selling at any time before they want you to. Even if you're 1000% profit.

The real definition is entering into a play, and selling out of it at the first sign of a downturn. Eg, buy calls on monday, stock dips Tuesday, you sell out for a loss because you're afraid you'll lose more in the next days.

If you are selling for profit, then there is no ""paper hands""."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean I‚Äôm just asking how that would benefit HF. If HF exit their short positions, they‚Äôre taking a loss that will break them, especially if the new floor is ~$280. However if they do exit their positions it will be a catalyst for a large squeeze

Also by my math, the effect this will have on the float will be negligible, so I don‚Äôt think it really affects the potential for the MOASS

Edit: I think I see what you mean: more shares makes it easier for HF to buy to close. By ‚Äúeasy‚Äù I thought you meant ‚Äúpainless‚Äù"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They will be forced to buy when they realize they‚Äôre the ones on the sinking ship this time.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are not selling them right away. The stock is oversold probably 2 or 3 times. 3.5 million shares is not a lot. The price will go up considerably. New board coming in with Ryan and his two appointees and Kurt Wolf, all of the other 8 board members will be gone- Already announced they are leaving in SEC filings."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Still a drop in the bucket for a stock that is oversold at least 2 times of the float possibly even 3 times (140 or 210 million).
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why not write an article on something you have insight on and publish it in medium?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They can recommend it, but not force it. Only the share lenders can issue a recall.

Also, GME can't recommend it until a maximum of 60 days before the shareholder meeting, which is April 12."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If you own shares then its up to you to recall them
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because a recall is on lent shares, I.e, your broker lending your shares. Wouldn‚Äôt exactly make sense for a company to sell stock and then say Na we want it back. What if you bought that stock and they took it back? Doesn‚Äôt sound so good anymore right."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is blatantly false.   

Paying a dividend does not cause a share recall, all it means is that short sellers have to cough up the dividend payments for the shares they borrowed, they don't have to close their short position.

Why does this trope keep getting floated around, there is no basis for it at all.

Proof - there are many stocks that pay regular dividends and special dividends from time to time.   Look up the short interest history on those stocks, you will see that the shorts NEVER close their positions.  Dividends don't cause shares to be recalled."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If everyone is so convinced this pig is stuffed and going down like a lead anchor why wouldn't the short interest be significant? Smart money is short if what you're saying is true, but somehow all the SI has dried up. Suuuuuure buddy. That tracks mmmhm."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,prepare to be downvoted/banned
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They never said they're issuing those shares this week. That's pure speculation. Same with the remaining short interest.

&#x200B;

wrong , again , dweeb"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, its bad news short term. However, depending on how many shares you believe are shorted, a 5% dilution may be just a drop in the ocean."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs beyond far out there.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I may be kind of a retard but I'm not THAT kind of retard.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. And they also can‚Äôt issue shares without making a filing like this. So remind me again what part of it indicates they won‚Äôt do it?

Look at amc who three weeks ago asked for this right and assured investors they weren‚Äôt thinking of doing it any time soon. Then boom last week they issued them"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a Hyundai
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The best, Jerry. The best."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks you very much is that saying they going to stard the squeeze in not to long ?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I appreciate you to take time to explain
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did up the value, but they‚Äôre not producing any shares.  They‚Äôre allowing the sale of 3.5 million of shares they already own.  Upping the value to 1,000,000 just means that they can sell that 3.5 million  at the new higher price, because before $100m was a high enough cap because the value was so much lower.

But they won‚Äôt be selling this all at once, and they may be selling fewer shares at higher prices.  We can‚Äôt know for sure, but this relatively small offering that likely will be offered in small periodic chunks shouldn‚Äôt deflate the squeeze"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, it reads a bit slanted, but I‚Äôm pretty sure this is just because their sale cap was $100m before, which was too low to effectively sell off all 3.5 million shares.  But they had that option to sell off fewer if they wanted (and didn‚Äôt)

I‚Äôm open to all perspectives, thanks for your input, let me know if you see or find a separate restriction on selling that they had - I can‚Äôt find anything on it beyond their 100m cap."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Say, like, right now, when we can't trade lmfao"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> they don‚Äôt have to just dump all the shares at one fixed price at once

You literally physically can't do that. Last time someone tried to dump 2 million shares at once, it did the exact opposite of fix the price."

Tech analysis and law of averages says they will do so. Remind me in 1 month."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They can sell 3.5m shares multiple times. But, they have capped the raise at 1bn. Personally this, in sync with the very positive trade update I find really good news. I see it as rocket fuel. Me thinks they will want to get on the rocket, and fill their coffers with Hedgiecash.  No financial advice though. Just my personal opinion."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. Thanks. Is this hypothetical or is this known to have taken place, whether in this instance with GME or another ticker?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"when you exercise an ITM call, you buy 100 shares at the strike price (plus the wasted premium)

when you sell a call option, you theoretically owe 100 shares, but since you exercised another option, and you already own 100 shares, that's just a covered call.."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for all the info you guys put into wsb. I was just wondering if they could of been covering their shorts slowly? So it wouldn‚Äôt shoot up the price all at once
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, I see. The numbers say that there's not a lot of short interest at the moment, but *there totally is guis, just trust me on this. See, the red string here connects to Ryan Cohen, and the blue one goes to the Ark of the Covenant, and where they cross here in in Wendover Texas where the Longhorn Steer was invented. Now Horn has four letters just like the word ""short"" so clearly it's a sign that Ryan Cohen thinks there's still a lot of outstanding shorts and since we love billionaires and trust them implicitly we know that is gonna moon asap and then all the good little apes will be rewarded and all the bad evil bears will be thrown into the lake of fire while we reap our eternal reward*...

Is that about right?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Uh-huh. That‚Äôs cute.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,We have no idea what the true SI is tho
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Because it was at 350 for all of two seconds? And the first time it was prior to their year end earnings call.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have enough cash tho, and typically you need less costs for an e-commerce based business than mortar stores"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Saying there‚Äôs a higher than 40% (current report) is not at all conspiracy tho, there‚Äôs facts that they‚Äôve done it in the past before"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is peak autism.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think for a second that they won't sell, but I believe they have the common sense to sell at much higher prices"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It just means when it goes above $285.71 they dont have to sell all of the 3.5M shares.  They just cant take in more than $1B.   If they wanted to they could sell 10k today, wait til it got up to 285 sell another 10k, etc etc.  They're not wanting to tank the price, and exactly why they announced higher earnings numbers for the 1st quarter."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a GME skeptic but this isn't correct. 3.5 million shares is nothing compared to the current outstanding shares. This isn't going to tank the price. The point is to raise money.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're doing it bc they have $2 billion in debt, and they need cash to fund whatever business model they're pivoting to."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bingo. 
They‚Äôre getting ready for the squeeze."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think they are allowed to raise more than $1B since that's what they filed.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get it. They can't sell more than 3.5M shares and can raise more than $1B.

I'm just looking at what they priced their shares at to determine 3.5M shares can raise $1B. They could liquidate those shares tomorrow if they wanted, but it seems that they intend to wait for a better price."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guess where you want. I‚Äôm thinking more like $250 max

They don‚Äôt want to miss out on this opportunity to get tons of capital using their overvalued shares"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it‚Äôs nice to see it laid out clearly in a publicly available document. (All I did was go to the SEC site and search for GameStop‚Äôs filings, super easy if you ever need to do in the future.)

Fortunately, smart apes all over WSB realize this, so the sentiment is bullish, not panic"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure thing - drive safe!

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"the shorts got scared when porche owned 70 ish % of the company, and my guess is that they are scared of the apes holding probably near 100% of GME shares. Only need 500.000 apes with 100 shares each to be able to ask the price we want"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Amc have debt they are trying to cover Gme dont
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, 3.5 mil vs 500 mil is nowhere comparable."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It won't lower the amount of shares you own no. It will slightly lower the value since there will be slightly more shares available. But it won't be noticeable.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I see virtually no volume tho on markewatch I don‚Äôt think many paper hands remain. It‚Äôd be dumb af to sel now after the rollercoaster we‚Äôve been to during 3 months
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, bro. 3.5MM shares aren't enough to affect the squeeze in any way shape or form.  If the squeeze is real (and It likely is) then retail may own 100% or more of the float alone and god knows how many other shares are out there above this. I am buying this dip hard, and there are probably 10,000 retail investors about to sink 5 figures today.

Also, this is happening in the premarket, the easiest time to manipulate the price. It's a good time for shorts to try scare retail to paper hand. If the drop continues into trading hours, it's a golden-time for diamond hands to buy the dip."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In what world is it advantageous for a company to sell more shares and get less money?

They set that as the top amount because it makes more sense than saying ""We're going to sell x amount of shares"" because share prices change. If they need/want to raise $1B they are better off saying they'll sell up to that amount worth of shares, and by stating they'll sell up to 3.5M shares it implies they think they'll sell for at least $285 a share, and, ideally more so they sell off less stock."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,And what happens when they sell those 6 bananas? Game over to the ongoing or potential short squeeze.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Paper hands refers to toilet paper, not paper money."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is how I define it. Thank you.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You may be right.  Good luck to you.

AMC diluted to pay debt, which was smart too. GME isn‚Äôt in nearly the same position."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"We don't know when. But we know it is heavily shorted. The math looks like it should squeeze but nobody knows for certain. I only bought the stock because I like gamestop. I don't offer financial advice

Edited for clarification"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can't say if anyone will or can start it on any given date. Factors do appear to be converging in the near future, though, and every day that goes by is more money shorts bleed.

Not financial advice, any of it, just my point of view."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes but being allowed to sell at a higher price allows them to move the shares.  When the share price is $200 you can't move a lot of shares before you hit the ceiling of $100m.  The key here is number of shares, now they can move 10x more shares **further diluting the free float.**"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, this is exactly what Tesla did 3 times in 2020 during its constant micro squeeze.

You aren‚Äôt going to get establishment longs if you torch them all."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling 3 million shares when nobody can buy them is stupid, it would ruin the price. And gamestop wants cash, not to tank the market. Which is why they made special provisions to sell at any time, at any price, just the same as if YOU held 3 mil shares. Except they probably can't buy them back the next second."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"With the right brokers, you can trade from 4am to 8pm, even as retail."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You literally actually physically theoretically potentially can. It's called a limit, and if 40,000 shares sell at that price, the remaining 3,460,000 remain... for sale... at that price.

If the price drops significantly and the dip is gobbled up, there's a massive sell wall at that price.

Sure, they didn't all sell at the same time, but all shares were dumped into the market in the form of a sell order and it becomes a massive wall, and with enough buying power, each share goes for that same price."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are probably going to do them in batches of 10,000 or so."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya most offers are at a fixed price and quantity bro
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Funds can go directly to GameStop and request to buy a certain amount of these shares at a certain price. GameStop will likely just say thank you for the offer. They‚Äôre not stupid
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually if they wanted to sell any serious volume they‚Äôd probably negotiate a deal behind the scenes that would be announced after the market closed that day.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So They don‚Äôt have to sell them all at once.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everything you have posted in this thread is either flat wrong or flies in the face of commonsense.

Stop posting when you clearly don't have a clue.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because if you sell that many all at once it will ruin the price and they won't get what they want, which is cash. It's better for them."

I cannot prove that they're doing it because I don't have access to their records so I can only speculate just like any other ape."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You used the 100 shares to cover 100 shorts. Now you wrote a call so you STILL owe 100 shares you just kicked the can down the road and paid a fee to do so.

You went from owing 100 shares now to owing 100 shares later. Unless someone makes you give them those shares early but this rarely happens"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"We know it's big enough that the shorts cannot truly cover or else they would have by now. Instead they're stuck spreading FUD and attacking the price like crazy.

I'd be convinced they had covered if they didn't regularly tank the price by 30-50% every time the price gets too high"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you even considering the price point those shorts are at? I feel like most people pretend the shorts are still underwater.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey I'm competitive alright? I like to be at the top
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I never said anything about tanking the price. Don‚Äôt be starting some straw man argument.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both numbers are maximums.  
up to 3.5 mill shares and up to $1000 mill.  
They don't need to fill up both quotas.  
If they sell at above $285, the numbers of shares are reduced accordingly."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet they will sell as much as possible as quickly as possible without creating a total rush to the exit. This is a once in a lifetime event for management.

If pet food can have an industry leader gaming can.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> In what world is it advantageous for a company to sell more shares and get less money?

In a world where they are signaling their intentions so that they are predictable. It signals to short positions we are prepared for smaller positions to take this small % of shares at below $285 so they can close out their positions. it essentially says no squeeze to be had if they want to start hitting the market to buy up shares.

it also says to people holding, you are not going to be down 500% because the amount of shares total is not enough to move the market that much. 

in the end it sets a middle ground to stabilize the price in a way that benefits small shorts, holders, and the company."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not here just for a short squeeze. Game Industry is more than american sports and movies combined in America. Squeeze would be a bonus. Market cap compared to similar companies makes it undervalued.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It means ""to sell at the first sign of trouble""

Technical analysts sell at the first sign of a loss of a movement, and onset of a downtrend.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't worry you will become a billionaire man. Each share will be worth millions. The company will be worth more than every other company combined. It will be the Tesla of the total stock market.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"To get to the 1Billion target the price needs to be at 285,7$.  

Selling them right now wouldn't give them the max return so there is no point in selling.  Also they want to sell as few shares as possible to the 1 Billion price target so it now depends on what you believe.

It might be that they start selling as soon as it hits 285. That is if you don't believe in the squeeze.  

I believe in the squeeze and in that case the most logical thing to do is selling at the peak.  

If you believe that they are retail friendly and the peak is high (100k+) they can sell on the downturn after the squeeze and not affect retail and still get the money.  

It all depends on what you believe right now and depending on that believe one or the other scenario makes more sense."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a pretty incorrect interpretation
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"What makes me think what? What makes me think selling lowers the price? Uhh, the way the market works?

Also they aren't selling for 1 penny profit. They own the shares, they issue them after all, they'll get full profit on whatever market price it's currently sold at. Also they need to file with the SEC and announce way ahead of time if they do buybacks. Also it's a game selling company, not a high frequency trading firm."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats not how you think it would work. A company cannot just buy and sell as you mentioned. They only disclosed to sell, thats it. Theres a reason for disclosures for buybacks and selling like these. Otherewise, Mr. SEC will knock on their doors."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"... I never claimed anything about retail dropping the price, are you even paying attention? The context was them being able to sell shares when we couldn't buy them, and dropping the price when ""we can't trade""... except, we *could*, which is objectively correct."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have 3.5mil shares, you initiate a sell order with limit at $150. 40,000 sell at $150 and this triggers a few additional sales, price is now $140 per share.

You still have 3,460,000 shares available, for sale, at $150. Someone comes along and buys all sell orders in the books between $140 and $149.99 and they want more. They start buying into your $150 shares. You now have 2,100,000 shares remaining at $150, still for sale.

Someone else comes in and is like I want 1.5mil shares. You're now at 600,000 shares, STILL listed at $150. A few others want out of their positions and sell, price is back down to $145. Some apes think this is a discount and yolo, buy up everything from $145 to $149.99 and start dipping into your $150 shares. You now have 450,000 shares at $150 each, still for sale. Someone else comes in and does a market buy of 750,000 shares, your 450,000 are now gone, you sold 3.5mil shares at $150 each, and that last buy also gobbled up everything for sale between $150 and $153, new price is $154.

So, yes, you're right, it would take someone wanting 3.5mil+ shares for this all to be executed IN ONE TRANSACTION, but why are you so hung up on semantics? You're wrong either way. *You can literally spiritually figuratively fundamentally rationally sell 3.5 mil shares in one transaction at a given price.* You can also do the above where 100 different people and institutions take part in buying up all 3.5mil shares over a period of 2 minutes or 2 hours, doesn't matter. 3.5mil shares were dumped all at once at a given price, and all were purchased at the given price."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are a major clearing house so they process a lot of trades. You have to play by their rules to use them and they're revising their rules so that something like gme can't happen again. Things like not being able to lend out the same share twice, no hiding shorts via options, and being able to force a fund to close their positions if the DTCC is worried. 

The DTCC essentially has to pay up if the bill gets too large for others to pay (if a HF fails, etc) so they're effectively covering their ass.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Riiiight an alt you made at the height of GME news. Good one.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What does It says. Can you post that?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Its not my math. I just posted source for that number. Can you do that for your number?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cultural transformation takes time.  This isn't a startup -- they have existing ways of doing things, and Dallas isn't exactly e-commerce central. 

Not to mention that though they've said 'transformation', nobody really knows what that means... turn the existing stores into games cafes?   have their own video games?  etc etc.    My guess is that they'll go through multiple iterations before finding anything that works, and it will take several years

Meanwhile, their existing staff isn't exactly eating ramen."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The implications are that they have the right but not the obligation to issue up to 3.5 million shares or 1 billion dollars of stock. They had the same option before, but didn't use it. 

This is bullish because it means they have the flexibility to raise more money to invest in the company. 

Investing in the company means the company is worth more money. 

The company being worth more money means their shares are worth more money. 

The shares being worth more money raises the stock price.

If you think that a company having the *option* to issue 5% of their outstanding shares to raise money when they are cash positive, have negligible debt, and have outstanding obligations that are shrinking purely by attrition is a bad thing for their share price, I have some very attractive timeshare opportunities for you."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What? No? Why? You're kinda sus
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know. My exposure in case of a complete failure of gme is 3% of my liquid capital. In my opinion the fundamentals are there that allow some kind of squeeze and the possible gain might be 100%, 1000% or if you want to be bullish 10000%. Dosn't matter really and even if the squeeze doesn't happen my avarage allows me to exit with minimal gains or small losses.  

It is a nobrainer but i understand why people are sceptical. I didn't load up as much as i now think i should have when it was 40. Because i didn't believe in the squeeze back then and switched in my mind to long term holding gme. Because i was sceptical back then aswell.  

Good luck aswell. Hope you make gains."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they sell 3 million shares, they don't sell 3 million times 200$. The last shares they sell will be the dip price. They are the ones selling during the dip, you're suggesting they buy from themselves. 

Also it's a retail and e-commerce company. It's not a high level trader. It's not a trader at all. It's a company that sells games."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree. Also imagine their brains about ""Fill or kill"" order type ))"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you dont understand the meaning of ""from time to time"" in this context."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"'From time to time' means they can sell a portion of this offering at any given time up to a total value of $1Bn.

I don't know why you think it means they can repeatedly sell chunks of 3.5m shares..."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,173 pre market...its dipping boys! Time to buy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"i think this is really bullish

1. share sale will be done from time to time through an ‚Äúat-the-market‚Äù equity offering program"". this means that share sales may be made at market prices prevailing at the time of a sale. I think they are expecting the squeeze soon and want to capitalize on it as they did not set a price for the share sale
2. purpose of share sale is to further accelerate its transformation as well as for  further strengthening its balance sheet
3. Also correct me if im wrong, this is share sale from their treasury and not a share issue? which means there's also no or not as much share dilution compared to issuing new shares"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're selling (UP TO) 3.5M shares that they own currently - not creating new shares. While this does introduce shares into the float I would say it's a good thing. 

They say it won't net more than $1,000,000,000 which means even if they sold every share they'd want $285/share...and lets be real - if they're expecting a squeeze they may just sell a few thousand shares off and still get that $1,000,000,000. It says they will sell *up to* 3.5M shares.

Also, and most importantly, this dip this morning of $30/share has been caused by a huge volume of...checks math...200,000 shares...which is nothing and shouldn't be taken seriously."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait ... Up to .. When they want ...   


Is there a possibility that they want to sell some of them during the squeeze because they suppose we'll momentarily go back to under 150-ish after it ?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh darn, I'm down a whole 3% now.   


You sure showed us, paper hands."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMO Long term outlook: super bullish.  Gives GME a war chest.  They are going to be offering shares at MARKET prices.  If it squeezes, maybe they offer 10k shares at 100k- they are capped at 1b total offering.  If it is going to squeeze, it would be financially irresponsible not to make this offering/annoucment."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôve done this so that they can sell those shares at what they see as the peak. They know what‚Äôs coming and they‚Äôre moving themselves into a position they can benefit too. Bullish move
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The amount of people panicking here and then screaming at others how it's going to be the worst day ever seems like a good start to the day. 

Gonna sit back with my cup of coffee and buy at the dip. See ya paperhands, don't go crying when it goes back up. You deserve it."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess this makes the current float 3.5 million shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,FB with terrible news and security breaches and it barely dropped in PM. GME plummets PM over this news? I'll just get some more then.....
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"U/ColCrabs

""They didn‚Äôt file an ATM offering. They UPDATED an ATM offering.

They already filed the same paperwork in December 08, 2020 to sell a maximum aggregate of $100,000,000.

They UPDATED the prospectus to a maximum aggregate of $1,000,000,000.

It‚Äôs not a new offering and it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll be initiating an offering. They‚Äôre simply expanding the ability to offer. It also means that they can sell for up to $1,000,000,000 now instead of only $100,000,000. I believe this means they‚Äôll offer when the price is incredibly high to maximize share price for fewer shares.

It‚Äôs also perfect timing for a FUD campaign as well. Right after a long break, European markets are closed for holidays and there are suspicious things occurring in Reddit subs.

I think this is probably a last ditch effort to drive the price down. It‚Äôs also wildly convenient that there are dozens and dozens of misleading articles being published."""
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish baby
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I expected GME to be under huge pressure to issue new shares from every side. 5% is reasonable for both sides honestly and will give us a chance to buy a dip. I was worried we would see a much larger stock issuing.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is the daily GME thread
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone beggin' for a dip last week better get on the horse today hahah. For the record I think this is actually good news

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at WSB acting like they buy GME based on minor things such as earnings reports.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome news!! Sounds like another week of $180-$200 boringness LOL
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like this is actually really good news for the apes. Getting the stonk cheaper to load up on the dip while transferring money into GameStops pockets. Whats not to love about that.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I think GME giving a 3.5 million share offering just shows that the squeeze is happening SOON. PREPARE FOR LIFT OFF!!!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,but why are we  dipping!?!? wtf.. it s w good news.. btw hold until I die
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They're so ready so many things to look forward to that this is just a drop in the bucket as far as problems we've dealt with already if they think they can take the money and do something important with it right now that they need then go ahead and do it make this fucking thing into the next Amazon that's fine too.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know the FUD bots are out in full force rn, but this is actually a good thing. 3.5mm are miniscule, and its not an immediate thing. It gives GME flexibility to also profit ""some"" off the squeeze. But ALSO limits them from doing a ""VW/Porsche"" style backdoor. 

GME is gonna make sooo much money off the squeeze and they aren't gonna be the ones to bail KG and friends out. IMO perfect!!!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very good news. Accelerating transformation, cleaning up balanace sheet, this is the way. Initial drop will morph into squeeze"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs this I‚Äôm hearing about them issuing another 3.5 M shares?!?! Would that trigger a share recount!?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm more upset that GameStop sells a NAMCO arcade cabinet without Ms. PAC-Man on board. What gives??
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can a smart person tell me this, assuming ~70m float, a 3.5m share offering is about 5% dilution. So, the stock should only decline 5%. Is that correct? 

However there are probably two more things, 1) retail selling due to fear and lower possibility of squeeze 2) HFs selling hard to drop price to make it look worse than it is

As for point 1) I would say market is not open yet and barely any retail would have sold during those hours so it's mostly selling by HFs. We should see a proper retail sell read during the hours.

In all, the filing makes GME ready to take advantage of squeeze, and become stronger for future.

Remember all, 3.5m shares or $1bn total. Breakeven price is about $285.71. Anything above that and the dilution will be smaller.

I do wonder if short HFs will pounce at the ability to get more shares asap or if a gamma squeeze would happen due to declining vol + now dropped price."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Who's buying the dip at open with me?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is dilution, but it's not the worst kind.  the company bought back 38 million shares in 2019 at an average of $5.19 per share, so selling 10% of that number (3.5 million shares) at the market >$150 seems like strong moves to me.  only problem is that they haven't done it 10x already."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How can they offer shares when the amount of shares already out there is kind of vague
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets," An 11% increase in sales for the entire quarter means GME still probably lost a ton of money in the quarter. Let's extrapolate:

actual 1Q2020 sales of $1.02B with cost of goods $739M and bottom line loss of $166M

estimated 1Q2021 sales of 1.13B with cost of goods $820M and bottom line loss of maybe $100M?

I'd say that's pitiful given the demand for video games in the current environment."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The previous filing would only net $100 mil - 
Approximately 660,000 shares..

It‚Äôs coupled with the actual new news of great uptrend in sales. 

I see why people will flake, but IMO this share sale is already priced in. They want to sell on the hype and make profit. They‚Äôre not going to sell their own dip. And they had 100mil to sell at market when we were 200+ and didn‚Äôt."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,i havent bought any vidya games or accessories in a while but anytime i do will be from gamestop.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if all this love is gonna go to their heads. They used to be such a sick gaming company I'd love to see them go back to having retro games and consoles and even getting out of all those small ass strip malls. Like they always have been able to run such a great gaming store. I hope they can make a comeback.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, does this mean GameStop is paperhands?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Shut up and take my money
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gonna be honest, this is... not good considering there were two new console launches and they've sold out of what they can with them.  And the stimulus checks/free money."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"How.... Just how are people making the mental gymnastics work to consider share dilution a good thing...?

Edit: pros: good for long term so if you plan to hold 2+ years it's great, GME gets capital to realize its new direction in e-commerce, this is not a new thing - Tesla did this multiple times and still managed to squeeze, this isn't a guaranteed sell just an ""in case we want to"" type of deal that some speculate is GameStop confirming squeeze imminent and they want their share of it

Cons: it is dilution, plain and simple. If they go through with this in the near future, it is bad for the share price and it limits or prevents a squeeze. 5-7% dilution is not 5-7% drop in price, it can be much, MUCH more significant. It's not a 1:1 and the market has never worked that way."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,G.mestop getting ready to sell means moon time soon. Imma buy more
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof - that was painful to wake up to.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't look like they are actually selling 3.5mil new shares guys. They are updating an old agreement from a max of $100mil to $1bil.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt blame GameStop for selling 3.5 million shares at this valuation. And they‚Äôll need capital to execute the transformation.

There have been so many things claimed and been proven wrong without those who were make these claims being held accountable. You can just spout whatever your wishful mental gymnastics are here and ignore the times your ‚Äútheory‚Äù was wrong.

An 11% increase from crap is not great."

At $1,000,000 they can only sell 10,000 shares. They are LITERALLY telling the world they can buy at any time. Why wouldn‚Äôt they wait for the squeeze, make a cool $$billion, and dilute the share total by far fewer than 3.5 million?? Attaboy RC!!!

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm SO confused. I woke up to find it open in the $160 range. Read this good news. Then find this: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/04/05/gamestop-shares-drop-12percent-after-announcing-plan-to-sell-up-to-3point5-million-shares.html

During the first nine weeks of fiscal 2021, similar government mandated restrictions resulted in limited operations, primarily in Europe, and the Company operated with an approximately 13% decrease in the store base due to its strategic store optimization efforts.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish AF - and this does not include all the ape and cat shirts we bought in March.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok guys what's happening,  does this mean I should sell?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, so that's why it's dumping right now. Classic earnings report"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Will this dilute stock price?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,üöÄüåö
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a question and am learning as the days go by: How many shares does GME have out there sold and people are holding? Is something going to happen to the people with the fraudent extra shorts? Shouldn‚Äôt the government and the SEC see that there are too many and do something about it?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally down 9% i dont even know what reality some of you even live in üòÇ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I love putting GME in 1min ticker view the mountain peaks are bootiful so much up and down

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It will drop after the shares are issued. It will rise when the apes buy them all up!

Well ok then UP again!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ohhhhh nooooo the stock dipped againnnn... anyways hope you all had a good weekend!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't net income more of a benchmark?

i want you to sell at 50 when I cover my short

imbeciles"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No sugar coating this. Did they need a share offering?? Their stock price is 10x more than it ever has been.
This may be the end bros if no share recall."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This! Upvoted
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's just a negligible amount of shares and will strengthen GME position with more cash on hand. Monthly sales were up 11%. ALL POSITIVE.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The also announced they're selling 3.5 million shares of common stock.  They're taking your money and running
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That's it? All that for 11% gain.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Obviously this mildly good news means the stock is worth 200 dollars right? This is a 15 dollar stock tops.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Totally justifies a 50x share price increase since then.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh cool, so what you are saying is that the stock is worth 0?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The difficult part to swallow here is the ""timing"" that they're likely waiting for is a lower share price, not a higher one. Remember who they sell these shares to primarily; institutional traders. Institutions largely trade on fundamentals, and they're not buying GME at $200 a share. Their clients would take their money and bounce - all else aside, the media has put in their customers heads that this price is absurd and unsustainable. These funds would be laughed off Wall St if they took large, long term positions at these prices. 

My bet is that they're going to work on getting the price below $80 before issuing - as counter intuitive as that sounds, it avoids the humiliation of issuing millions of shares that no one will buy."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So they‚Äôre doing 10% better than when every store was literally shut down? Shouldn‚Äôt they be doing much better than that?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not to be pessimistic - but someone change my view. 

Gamestop takes on multiple well-known millionaire executives to its management during the most volatile period of its company‚Äôs existence. 

The thing about millionaires is they‚Äôre usually really good about going where the money is. Gamestop plans to sell 3.5m shares to the market during a time when buying GME is of meme-level popularity and will attract buyers from around the globe and of any income level. 

To me, this looks like GameStop‚Äôs finale. The millionaire business executives come in, sell off hundred of millions in stock to ‚Äúreinvest‚Äù. Will it surprise anyone when GameStop goes belly up and the executives leave with massive amounts of cash? It‚Äôs part of the formula. It‚Äôs happened to companies before. 

GameStop‚Äôs in my area of the east coast are closing. 4 of them in a 20 mile radius have closed their doors in 2021. I want to believe this is still a value stock with a bright future, but all signs point to no. If someone can explain why I‚Äôm wrong, please do."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Things gonna tank to $90. No tiffany blue lambo for me i guess. üòï
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice!  That puts the actual value of the stock somewhere around $8, lol."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Game Stop is doomed to extinction. Ask yourself, why would anyone drive to a GME store and what for.    
Its just a matter of time.   
As for their cyber presence; all they can do is be a middleman for manufacturers so their prices and inventory will pale in comparison to actual manufacturers cyber offerings."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamestop is a disgusting evil company that rips ppl off. Stop supporting it
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow 11% higher year over year, that would put their stock value at something like 10% higher than it was a year ago right? 

So let‚Äôs see, carry the one...

GME $5.00 4/30? üòÖ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,11% of Jan-March sales?   So 11% higher than really terrible.  Only moderately terrible.  Sorry.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,3.5m shares guaranteed to be sold by GME. I don‚Äôt know about you guys but that‚Äôs selling pressure on the stock
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Please check xdn coin can you buy some please
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Worst decision of administration to do this offering.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not enough growth to validate the share price. What valuation model validates the current price? It is horde mentality of a poonoozie scheme. A üê¶ in the ü§ò is worth 2 in the bush
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So what.  Last year was very shitty for company.  Stock is worth $13 max.  Short this people.  Make $.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Down $30 now!  Why are they doing this share thing??? Dammit!  Feels like a slap in the face
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop Execs to sell 3.4M shares. Y‚Äôall remember Hertz?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,11% YoY!  That ought to justify the fact that the stock is trading up 5000% (literally).
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GME fucked by not going the software route or even funding  their own game studio.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,A miserly 11% from nuked base number lol you babies are toast. No wonder they‚Äôre dumping capital on your ass.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,and down 11% in premarket. Cool.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really want this dip to hold till 9 so I can buy it, seriously this shit is gonna shoot back up."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before everyone gets too erect, let's not forget at this time last year GameStop was closing 700 stores. Comping to zero isn't necessarily a success."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Let all get some amc we can get more money then back to gme when we get more money for GameStop
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you really just use fundamentals on a stock that is over-valued to the extreme? I get you want to it to go up but please don't make the reason their revenue growth.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Very much in line with their 6200% increase in stock price over the same period...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmaoooooooooooo 11% increase? GME ain‚Äôt Tesla dawg. Fools.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The new issue of shares would get GME $1 billion in cash at about 70 million shares. If we assume the company has no other value it would give a stock price of  14 $. There are quite a few PUTS far out of the money at strike prices below 14 $. Since the new money more or less guarantees those puts are fucked, do you think there will a mass sell of those PUTS when GME has issued the shares?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let‚Äôs just be honest with ourselves here, game stop degenerates. There is absolutely no news or announcements that could trigger any of you morons to sell your shares of this massively overvalued stock. It won‚Äôt be until 2022 that you start to realize the major gaming companies out there are unwilling to let GME have a piece of the market and when you least expect it the stock will plummet. Until then, keep buying it and making tons of money. Just don‚Äôt get caught by the guillotine."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's fucking horrible! LOL

Don't see what this has to do with the short squeeze, though."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay gamestop is still fucking flat like wtf. They havnt moved anywhere and always came back to the same place
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought they said they didn't need to do this in the earnings report? Didn't need to sell shares to go along with the transformation?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow it's almost like the console cycle boosted their sales like it does every console cycle
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Somebody give me some news on why we've just dropped $25 pre open?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,ITS OVER LMFAOOO
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Does it matter? GME could file for bankruptcy and people will still buy it.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You failed to inform ppl about the 7%dilution of shares for aprox 600 million cash. This is bad news for GME. I bought the dip at 168$ now it‚Äôs steady climbing.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yet it crashes this morning? Nice try Shitedel
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not dillution, they are selling their holding of common stock:

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,B.M.B....Buy Mo Bitches!!!!ü¶çü¶çü¶ç
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This likely has to do more with the next Gen consoles being released late last year than anything to do with a shakeup in leadership or their business model. Regardless GME is still not worth anywhere near $175 lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If people spent the money they are investing in a stock that‚Äôs almost guaranteed to tank eventually, the actual chain may be able to bounce back a bit in real sales."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,3-4.00 in a month -two? I'm thinking yes. :)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean last year was COVID so that's not an incredible thing. How do their earnings compare with 2019?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shut up, and take more of my money!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"BULLISH! Now it's final endgame, this just means that also GameStop is expecting the MOASS .... FUCK THOSE PUTS!!!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Print it all over front and back!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In this situation, will the powers that be need to recall and inventory existing shares (the great Count)?

I don‚Äôt see how they could just add to the pot without knowing what‚Äôs in there first."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's actually pretty weak growth. 

Also, they did a public share offering, which is a worst case scenario for the short squeeze theory.

GME is going to tank today, even more than it has premarket. I'm expecting a -20% day followed by a slower bleed over the next few days."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,print my money on a disc front and back. I'll be there later to pick it up
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You should finance their debt! Oh you already are after the dilution.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The leading article in the mainstream media is about share selling by the company and an immediate dip
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,AhahaahahahAhahahahHa
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Aaaaaand they sold shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt wait to see u lose it all not understanding something like price to earnings ratio. Cuz if u understood that You would know that this news doesn‚Äôt fucking matter. I banked my money and moved on...but youre still chasing rainbows when it‚Äôs just a skid mark on your underwear
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why tho? What was the explanation?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs falling because they announced they may sell up to $1 bil in shares at the money. This means dilution, which shareholders don‚Äôt like."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is not in any way trading on fundamentals, earnings don't matter right now"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good news does the opposite sometimes. But if it dips then ape gets more üôåüíéü¶ç
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"People are freaking out about it, why? We all knew they were going to do this."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,this thread with info about new shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They announced they MAY dilute the stock and sell 3 million shares to take advantage of the stock price
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Being a retarded ape... is this a good thing for us or a bad thing?  Why?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why is it good news? If they are offering new shares, doesn't that mean shorts have access to new shares so they can buy and close their short positions?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck me this is a firesale! Time to get more shares!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Cheaper for the hedgies to tank the premarket instead of after opening.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Also German premarket is closed so they‚Äôre probably trying to push the price down without any resistance.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The drop is probably due to the share offering announcement
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"TD is saying: ""GameStop shares are trading lower after the company announced a 3.5 million share stock offering"""
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey bro did u know about these new BALSK and TSTCL shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They are issuing 3.5 million new shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So the good news is causing it to dip by 28ish?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hfs are famous for shorting when there is both good news and bad news. It‚Äôs effective. It makes investors think that there were higher expectations than what this good news shows
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they are raising their cap to a billion, they must know something is up. 10k is not a meme"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They are doing a stock offering
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bc the pop already happened, retard."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone mentioned they‚Äôre issuing more shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Issue 3,5 new million shares, that‚Äôs why the drop. New shares through Jeffries, check the news"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It dropped further as they issuing 3.5m shares of its common stock. Check out the news ü•≤
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently there's the potential for a 3.5 million additional share sale.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre selling 3.5m shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,i mean they announced selling shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo mate, I think they announced they may create synthetic share like 3.5million sell, i dont know what I am talking about smooth brain
Joke"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,With less shares too
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but every media outlet is spinning it as ‚ÄúGameStop going to sell 3.5 million shares RIGHT FUCKING NOW!!!l"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood and Market Watch had another pre made article that hit at 7:02 central time this morning and it was literally right when the stock started to drastically fall hahahaha
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">They increased the $ cap from 100 mil to 1 bil. Bullish if you ask me.

How? It'd be diluting the existing shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is It good news considering the New gen gaming stations and stay at home trend?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"And on 3.5 million shares instead of 6 million.

10x the capital raised on almost half the shares. Bullish as can be."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes, strong numbers are bad news when investors expected more. GME's sales are up 11% vs comparable period last year, while the stock price is up 4000%..."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sales up 11% vs pre-corona numbers last year is surely a bad sign. :-p
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let say they take the option to sell all 3.5 million shares (OF PREEXISTING SHARES). That‚Äôs 3.5m out of 200m - nothing, it‚Äôs so small. That‚Äôs just to raise cash to push the business and keep cash on hand to be safe. All bullish, all of it. Even the Spaceballs know it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I buy dip
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If media reported with a positive bias rather than negative: GameStop announces 3.5 million share offering at $285 per share.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's a weird thing to read all the comments that are misinterpreting the share issuance news. the decision to increase to $1B cap is dilutive to existing investors, which is bad for existing shareholders - in a vacuum. given the context of the company - formerly presumed by most to be near bankruptcy despite good signs for new gen consoles and a publicly announced transformation plan - this represents a huge opportunity for the company to strengthen the speed of the operational pivot plan given the new demand for the stock (whether by longs or by shorts closing). 

the sales figures for Q1 are evidence that the demand remains strong and re-affirms that if the company can execute the pivot, there is a lot of value left to go. 

all that said, i am surprised that as of this writing the stock is trading even - I think a 5-10% loss on the day was more in line with what i expected. a short term hit given the dilution, but long-term stability for the pivot plan."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn‚Äôt last long.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. 

Amc diluted for bonuses and they are doing fine. Gme is diluting for business transformation. If anything this invites bigger players to buy the float. 

If you look at it in terms of anyone believing in the squeeze. 

The 1 million per share price in the moass means GME is only selling 1000 shares.
Everyone gets their squeeze and GME gets to make a billion dollars instead of 100 million. It doesn‚Äôt say when they will sell shares; surely they will wait for a squeeze if one is there. (Spoiler: it probably is)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya I miss that boat I could have bought moreü•∫üçΩÔ∏èbuy order placed for 2 shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no, there's bad news. It's that they're offering 3million new share at the market, lolololol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How is it bullish that they are drastically further diluting your share value? Or that in the biggest GameStop craze of the last 10 years their sales increased by only 11% when a lot of people are at home playing video games?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it better to wait still before buying?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I was going to sell some CSP and just bought GME shares instead on that premarket dip.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The timing and amount of any sales will be determined by a variety of factors considered by the Company
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"5% of the float OR $1 billion AT ANY POINT.   Here is an example:  If the stock squeezes to 100k per share, they can offer EXTRA SHARES FOR 100K up to $1 billion FOR LESS SHARES GIVEN for a total of ONLY 10K SHARES. Gamestop knows they can get 1 billion dollars cash off of possibly the lowest count of shares possible AS WELL AS making the company stronger.   The plan never changed:  Shorts never covered.   üíéü§≤üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  Bullish AF."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like GameStop wants some tendies when it rockets!!!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this mean? The premarket is dropping
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,APE language?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good news!

Investing in the transformation process."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welp, they just fucked us raw."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this mean???
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,a high school musical reference was the last thing i expected here
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know the main stream media can seeee us... in a way that's different than just a retard.... creating space between apes... till we're selling hard....

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"*checks premarket*

Ah yes, ""soaring"" indeed.

üíéüëã"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope the dip go deeper to buy more
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"3. They'll be increasing the number of shares in the float, so although they're not diluting shares per se, they are increasing availability which is basically the same thing for the open market."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If it‚Äôs owned by the treasury it is owned by the company and thus owned by the existing shareholders. Once it leaves the treasury then the ownership of each shareholder also declines. So yes it is similar to a dilution.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,On your third point. Treasury shares are still issued but no longer outstanding so do not pay dividends. Pulling then back out of treasury would be dilution.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,3. It is share dilution. Its just not the issuance of new shares. When companies buy back they have the option to retire the shares. Alternatively they can hold them. Either has the same effect. You as a shareholder now own part of a company that owns parts of itself.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"this move by management is independent of squeeze. corporate management doesn't risk the viability of fundraising on timing a short squeeze. they have seen sustained demand for the shares in 2021 at a valuation over 10x what is was just 6 months ago, and it would be stupid not to raise capital to accelerate an expensive pivot plan that can create value for both new and existing shareholders. this offering creates a big opportunity for shorts to close their position without getting squeezed (at least not to death), but it's a very good sign for gamestop operationally."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol who the fuck is going to buy shares at this price?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The metal gymnastics being used here to day this is good is funny af
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good summary üíéüôå 

Maybe a good day to average down!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly! Finally someone who reads and thinks before writing some half baked bs which causes confusion and insecurity. Thanks!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is absolutely equivalent to creating new shares.  The company gets money for putting shares into circulation.  Whether or not they existed already in some way is a moo point.

Still, it is relatively small dilution compared to the death spiral that they were looking at not many months ago.

Everyone knew it was going to happen.

It gives the company cash that will be needed if they are to rebuild and grow.

None of that changes the fact that buying gme is a gamble."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So what you‚Äôre saying is that corporate leadership at The Company is saying that $285 is Not A Meme‚Ñ¢?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This should be pinned
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,To me It signals that they think the stock is overvalued and want to cash in on the hype.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They _may_. Or may not.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This. I am actually surprised I see few of these comments
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,And who exactly is going to buy at $285/share...? I guarantee they're going to undercut you guys.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes it gives them the right to sell up to $1b! That could only be 10,000 shares lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They also have the right to buy up shares which they explicitly stated in their sec filing last month. They can sell at the top and buy at the bottom to make insane money and further increase their stake.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,In regards to the offering.  Obv the sales numbers are also hella bullish.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree. There is nothing here that is negative imho. The share offering is too small in numbers of shares to indicate a massive capital raise. If anything, it is puny. This to me looks more like positioning the company for taking part of the rocket launch. Just my two cents. I have no fucking idea what I am talking about."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would any buyer be buying released stocks right at the squeeze?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,But they capped it at 1 billion?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GBTOAT?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You're in luck pal
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook incompetence is priced in lool
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So say we all.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,8:30am
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I waited for this dip
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesn‚Äôt change a thing, but paper hands are gonna do what they do and diamond hands will have a nice lil discount."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They also announced a potential to sell 3.5m shares ‚Äúat the market‚Äù. But, not a dilution (addition of shares) this is, as I understand it, giving them the ability to sell these shares that they currently own to raise more capital."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the sale.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Also news of the company selling more shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt make a profit then. What‚Äôs the point?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamestop is diluating shares they are finally cashing on the wsb
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seeing as it looks like a bunch of stock was borrowed early this morning, I'm not even worried about it"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously, offering 3.5m stock from time to time @ the market is a reason. But, of course this looks to me to be oversold deluxe. Just my view this though etc. Also, I can only think of this as a good possibility for Gamstock themselves to be part of the rocket liftoff. So, for now I am treating this as a discount. A big one! I can of course be really wrong.."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"We all pal, it will be back to at least 200 anyway"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They will sell at a minimum of 285. They said up to 3.5 million to make 1bn revenue.  They know a squeeze will happen and are taking advantage.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"$285 is $1B/3.5M, but it's not a breakeven price"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Only around 6% of the float and a billion dollars in hand for the transformation to e-commerce. I'm down for that.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not to exceed, $1bln, which with a current market cap of $13.2bln .... is 7% dilution."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it dilution if they are not new shares? As far as I know these are shares they already held in their treasury.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That is good news because they will use it for the transformation to online sales.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. But looks to me more like Gamestock getting on the rocket. Just look at how it is structured. I personally think they are going to sell those 3.5m shares in the rocket launch :) if they wanted to raise capital, they would offer a heck of a lot more shares to the market. If you paperhand now. You are a clown. Just my two cents. No idea what I am talking about. i pay 1 dollar for 20 cents usually. Koko"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Totally legal. No problem.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gamestop owns shares of its own company (naturally). They are selling some of these shares. Most companies wouldn't wouldn't want to do this since it signifies the company is in financial trouble and needs money by selling shares rather than a product. However, all of us already knew Gamestop was a business going under. Consequentially this move is intended to fix the company from the storefront model to an online based one, which will allow the company to survive and not just die, which is favorable to those who have GME shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,These threads are desperate for the copium.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean? Fundamentals are clearly moving the stock. /s
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gme if you like money, AMC if you don't"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah pretty underwhelming
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I will buy the dip
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling their own or issuing new shares?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I can‚Äôt prove him wrong."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Double down already
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because a company that was near bankruptcy less than a year ago is now able to raise a billion dollars with a maximum 6% share dilution? Bad for short-term positions, good for long-term positions."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Because these folks are larping as traders. They have absolutely 0 clue what they are doing.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not really mental gymnastics. GameStop is a failing company. Anyone holding GME does not want GameStop to die. GameStop is selling more shares in order to raise capital in order to change their business to a more profitable and survivable model (such as online rather than storefront). Naturally also the short term price drop means a lot of people lurking on the stock has an opportunity again to buy in like what we had a few months ago.

This only is bad to people who are in GME for the short term, like the people who believed that GME was going to skyrocket to 1,000 on April Fools. Obviously anything other than up is going to hurt someone who bought at a peak expecting the trend to be uninterrupted."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it dilution, or are they selling those shares from what they as a company hold?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dilution is fine if it can facilitate growth greater than the amount diluted.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The thing is if it's a 5-7% dilution and the price drops more than that, wouldn't that actually be ok even in the short term since you can grab the stock on a bit of a sale? Of course with the short squeeze theory that may not work out but depends on how shorted the thing supposedly is."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where are they diluting? They stated they could just like they always could have but with a now better max ceiling of 1 billion. That is bullish if the company thinks the same share offering is now worth more as a private placement. Not to the public, but a private placement"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,And replaced by super yacht !
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Replace it with a Super Yacht!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Money trumps virtue signaling every day of the week.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How is that 7%?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,only if you're betting the farm on a short squeeze and don't care that the rest of the economy is churning
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lying about it isn‚Äôt either  . Reduction on shares they CAN sell, and they diamond handed till now  ."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who else read that in Cartman‚Äôs voice, lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They just voted to allow internal shareholders cash out. So...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Different quarter bro
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if that's true, that's nothing üòÇ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,800% increase is too much. The actual percentage increase is 694.20% when you do the mathematics.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No one is ever selling.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right. Billionaires like Ryan Cohen often buy 13% stake in a company they think is dying.

They then also bring a bunch of their successful buddies on board to ride that ship into the ground. That makes total sense."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE MAYBE

>The timing and amount of any sales will be determined by a variety of factors considered by the Company."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Also at a max of 1bil. Like 285 a share?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,STFU it means the moon is coming and they know it
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a hazy idea of what you mean. Do you mind explaining more?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Volume is big in PH... more than 500k already, recently we were not even at 500k at open. 
I think i ll buy the dip anyway"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah... a few months ago was before Ryan Cohen and a bunch of other successful executives came aboard to right the ship.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They just raised their internal minimum price for that sale to $285 a share, for a maximum of $1 Billion. The company (RC and Board) thinks there will be a big surge in share price and wants to build a warchest by selling 3.5 million shares at most. It‚Äôs not enough to cover all the shorts, so it‚Äôs really just giving them leeway for the company to cash in when the rocket takes off."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, this gives GME the legal room to ride the rocket with the rest of us."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha that‚Äôs funny. You should do standup.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It was bad. Only down 2%
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It will be hillarious when Gamstock raises 500k per share atm imo :) If they do.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Reduction on shares they CAN sell. Valued at $285ish I believe  . AND they diamond handed through prices way above that.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally no.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Or they can issue and dump the price to $80 right away.  I don‚Äôt get this reasoning
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You're an idiot.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reduction on shares they CAN sell, and they diamond handed till now  . Nothing wrong there, even if they do sell  . They valued it $285ish a share I believe  . 

I still think you have the right idea about the corporate thinking. Just off on the numbers imo."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So they want the item that they are selling to be worth half of what it is now? When I sell things I like to sell them at higher prices, not lower prices."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They stated a long time ago they are consolidating their brick and mortar presence. They increased online sales 180% last quarter wtf do you want
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They capped it at $1b. If they really wanted to take advantage they could easily sell more shares/take more money.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip then
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like Amazon. Wait
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Less talk more action. I dare you pussyboi.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not guaranteed just allowed. Meaning they want to take advantage of the squeeze as well and could sell them on the way down for extra capital after retail is out.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember Hertz selling off after filing for bankruptcy.  What‚Äôs your point?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, execs are traded in like baseball cards at Gamestop, wouldnt be suprised if more ‚Äúto be ex‚Äù board members would paper hand their ticket to the moon üöÄ i did the same when I left a classic enterprise hardware company"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Casually dropping a few million. Ok bud.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You must be terrible in bed.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla premarket and GME premarket have alot in common, bears and bulls both couldnt keep the pace"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They can only issue 3.5mill shares gamestop can't issue already issued shares, so they price would be just above 285 or higher(in case the share price is higher) they can only issue shares till 1bill is reached. So no it has nothing to do with puts, gamestop can't dictate the price of the free market if no on will pay anything for the shares they can drop below 1$. But what the statement is telling is reacher in chase the share price goes up alot they can now gain 1bill in capital instead of the 100mill they could earlier, but they can no longer issue as many shares. So all in all they believe in the MOASS"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The shorts. They are also paying for fake news posts and Reddit bots saying that GME has started diluting their shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why don't GME save time and money and just sell them to DFV directly?

I like the stonk."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Monorail!

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In all seriousness, when are you guys gonna stop trolling and move on? You're playing with people's money. Okay, sure, you had your minute of fame in January and February. It was funny. I chuckled every time I saw the stock go up.

But for heck's sakes Reddit, it's April. Gamestop has no future; it is a dead company and you all know it. My uncle lost several millions betting against GME, which was and still is an intelligent investment decision to make, based on the market evaluation of Gamestop. He's not a big dog on Wallstreet. He's a man trying to retire. 

All for what? So you guys can turn 1 penny into 10 pennies? Utterly preposterous."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This separates the boys from the men. BUY you silly apes!!!ü¶çü¶ç
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah because 3.5 million is definitely enough to cover all short positions.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll reply to this one as your other isn't showing. Its not through retail is it. Shorts gonna short.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Well then I expect 3.5 million shares to be bought on the dip. Back to where we started. Still jacked to the tits!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty weak growth? Umm, yeah, sure dude. Its not like their dealing with the aftermath of a pandemic WHILE transforming their whole business intertwined with an replacement of the whole leadership. Try again with your fud, thanks, next!"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" is a time tested adage. This happens a lot with earnings, even if it's a beat."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Textbook attention manipulation. Earnings get people's eyes on the stock. No matter the actual news, just short the stock, so people's eyes now move on to the price and it's in falling. Headline: Financials are out, stock in freefall."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock price is up over 1,000% YTD, sales up 11%. And this sub asks why the price isn‚Äôt higher."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds being hedge funds
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to offer a number of grounded explanations: 

1) a lot of positive news is already baked into the market price such that it would require PHENOMENAL news to force an upward swing. 

2) measuring the company as a brick-and-mortar retail chain means that they're currently over-valued, so until there is a shift to GameStop being a tech company, not just by measure but also my mind, there won't realistically be good news that will act as a ""catalyst"" as many people are hoping and waiting for. 

3) the good news we hear, combined with the tempered outlook on potential bad news, is all it takes to shutter the ranks of investors made-up by a significant portion of weak-will paper-handed bitches who aren't used to morning diarrhea. Perceived bad news can be used and manipulated by larger funds in order to further test our medal, see if they can cause another steep dive allowing them to get out from beneath some of the most toxic positions. GameStop selling off 3.5 million shares (up to $1bil in total funds raised) should represent, AT MOST, a 5% dip WHEN they pull that trigger, not merely having the option. 

This morning, there was an up to ~13% dip from what I saw in pre-trading hours. During normal trading hours, that much depression of a stock was not sustainable, but I'd bet a shiny new nickel that more than an 11% price drop would trigger some stop-loss orders, and other traders simply done with the volatility. 

Real question this all comes down to is really simple, are your balls big and black and hanging from your wife's boyfriend's body, or are they made of fucking diamond? I didn't hear no bell, and I don't see DFV dumping his shares. He's got a family, kids. I'm just me, so if he can rock this bitch, I can, too. So can you."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because it‚Äôs not great growth compared to the same time period from last year when stores were shutting down and nobody knew what the fuck was going on, especially considering how much popularity and recognition the company has gained in that time?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sales are up 11% in Q1 year-over-year, while share price is up 5,000% over that same period. It‚Äôs easy to see why investors are not impressed."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because 11% increase in sales does not equal 1,100% increase in price."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,hedgies trying to not lose too much money.... they're just giving us discounts really
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The price is over inflated by a bunch of apes lmao...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The price is disconnected from fundamentals and is only (mostly) connected to the current situation with the squeeze
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,11% really justifies the current price üòÇ

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not even proper dilution like you‚Äôd get from a rights issue. Any new buyers are paying current market value and the cash is going to straight into the company which a) underpins the share price and b) allows them to do their restructuring.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just an ape but I was wondering if the hf's are allowed to buy the new stock?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,so... more stocks for us to buy?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So it will get harder to pick up the people @300?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The just changed the terms and conditions for their share offering if they were ever to do one. They were always able to before but now they raise the value to 1 billion dollars compared to a couple of million before. Very bullish
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,But Uncle Bruce said this means the company will have lots of cash which is good only if AMC do this mean dilution.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is actually an update to an existing offering that they never exercised. They reduced the number of shares offered from 6M to 3.5M and increased the max cap from 100M to 1B. They can put these shares into the market at any time, and they don‚Äôt have to all go in at once. They are saying that shares are now worth $285 each, minimum. IMO they are setting themselves up to capitalize on the squeeze when it does happen."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not even close to dilution,it‚Äôs so minuscule"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not much, brought 2 shares during premarket. Doing my part."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I have been holding 1 for over a week now. I'm so excited to hold more :)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't have as much GME as I would like, so I actually am somewhat happy about this because like I told some guys in a previous thread, once it goes sub 100 I can afford to buy more shares. 

Or maybe I'm a retard. :D

Edit: Wow, the paperhands are going reee over the thought of it going 100. Sucks for them, great for the buyers like us who like the stock."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it good news though? Doesn't it indicate the stock should be worth around 11% more than it was last year?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine thinking good news is not priced in to this valuation lmao.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy on the rumour, sell on the news."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why is good news though? For a company, sure - a billion of dollars to transform the company into a tech play. That will take years, but for the good company. Apes here have been talking about short squeeze, gamma squeeze and MOASS. So, now there is more shares for hedgies to consume. That‚Äôs good for them, not for us. Spaceship is cancelled?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Knew?  You mean hoping.  It's cash for transformation as opposed to AMC where it's cash for continuing operations and executive bonuses.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs not entirely true, I saw a bunch of regards who genuinely thought GameStop would do a buyback for some reason."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,G talk!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They would have been crazy not to
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"hmm, I‚Äôm not surprised, but saw it up to chance (50:50 that they‚Äôd do it) with how crazy the whole $GME saga has been"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"3% drop per % of dilution seems to be industry standard.  If you believe in the company, management, and know the share sale is coming it's a great time to buy."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bratha, I thought that it was all "" tongue in cheek"". But I realize that there really are some ignorant, tard apes on this sub!!! Holy crap!!! I mean, I know I'm not smart, but at least I try and ejamakate myself a bit. üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read most of the threads even a day ago. The prevailing sentiment on this was something like ""They are cashflow positive. Why would they ever dilute? FUD"".

It is good news if they do it at this price. I agree. But people have been told this is just lies and wouldn't happen."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because they see sell and assume the worst. It's also possible no one actually is selling and it's just manipulation again. 

Of course the SEC filing just gives them the right to sell, they're not doing it immediately."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That is the narrative that the short funds are trying to push while they attempt to manipulate a sell off
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"3 mil is practically nothing, shorts keep pounding the price down with way more and can't break anything of value."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great, going to buy more at a discount."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is that announcement? Serious question I didn‚Äôt see it mentioned in article above
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not ‚Äòmay‚Äô. They 100% will
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's good news for long term holders though, right? They're taking advantage of what's likely a short-term situation in order to boost their long-term outlook? And people who like the stock can get more at a discount?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,At 1 billion dollars. so $285 a share minimum
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs still out of preexisting stocks. That ‚Äúdilution‚Äù is so minimal and again out of stock that already exists. It‚Äôs not newly issued.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha. What if this is what will be voted on in June, if stockholders will approve the new shares, thus since most won‚Äôt want to do this they will recall all their shares for voting rights, and everyone knows what happens then"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait wait. May. Not WILL.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The MAY happened back after the end of the last earnings call.  This is the WILL, but without a firm date.  From the selloff in afterhours, my guess is as soon as market opens."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course! How else could they sell 10,000 shares for 1 bilion?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"And at a $1bn cap.  It would be in their interest to get as close to that number as possible as they are trying to raise capital.  They cannot do that selling at the current price.

This is just giving themselves more options.  If it squeezes at some point, they could even sell into that potentially."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Down from 6 ?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I was thinking they maybe want to sell those 3 million shares once the squeeze gets squooze.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's def them taking advantage they are planning to raise the few hundred million to pay off debt seem to me liquidation may start after that whether that leads to transformation or just a great time to hop off with a gold parachute remains to be seen
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Increase in sales is always good. New shares.. it's 50-50. On one hand it's dilution, short bail, taking advantage of inflated price; on the other hand payed off debt that means lower costs, much quicker transformation and growth and off chance it's preparing to bail shorts Porsche style."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing for GME bad thing for current shareholders. Now would be the last chance to take your gains
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on where you bought in and if you're still praying for a squeeze. Diluting with 3.5 million new shares basically guarantees the squeeze won't happen and is bad news for the company as a meme stock.  However, the cash injection from the new shares and actually fucking making a revenue target is better news for the company as a company.

If their new model is successful and they start meeting expectations, I would guess they'll stick somewhere in the neighborhood of $100/share.

Good news if you bought in at $40 and are really in it for the long haul of GameStop."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre offering new shares AT MARKET PRICE. So they still face a loss either way. The amount of DD showing how many false shares have been created should be enough to convince any ape that an additional 3.5m shares wouldn‚Äôt even be as much as a handful of dirt into the hole the hedgies have dug. No big deal.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure but shorts still need to buy those shares and it‚Äôs the company‚Äôs best interest to sell them at the higher price point to raise max cash
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Me thoughts are they can offer it when they want so when it rockets they can get their tendies too.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôve done this so that they can sell those shares at what they see as the peak. They know what‚Äôs coming and they‚Äôre moving themselves into a position they can benefit too. Bullish move
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. They said they gonna sell market prize though, at any time they want , any amount, up to 3.5m

So or they believe the price will drop badly and wanna sell  asap...
Or they think it will moon and waits for the moment..

Basicly..no news yet."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sure but it‚Äôs only 3,5m not nearly enough to hold off the squeee"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,they're gonna need a lot more than 3.5 mill
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Because they want to be able to sell shares when the squeeze is happening.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They have always been able to buy shares at the market price.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Up to 3.5 million shares. It‚Äôs a dilution sure but only about 5%. Not massive when you need to cover well over 100% of float.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You're in the wrong thread...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts exactly, is this not correct?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a very small amount of shares compared to outstanding shorts, and will strengthen the company - keep in mind, shorts need the company to buckle under - longs want it to grow and strengthen. This is in short not a meaningful dilution of shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's 3.5M it's too low a share to close all short position
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It gives them opportunity for growth. Growth means more profits. More profits means the stock is worth more.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Because they can use all the new cash to speed up their investments in their new business model
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">Why is it good news? If they are offering new shares, doesn't that mean shorts have access to new shares so they can buy and close their short positions?

One of the biggest killers of any company is too much debt. If too much revenue is being used to pay off debt, there is no money to grow the company, advertise, fix up stores, acquire other companies, or simply keep the lights on, etc. 

Selling 3 million shares at ~$180 per share, gives the company $540 million in cash. They can use that money to get rid of debt AND grow the business. (this is similar to what AMC did to rid themselves of $600 million in debt).

As for shorts....shorts can't be short forever. Eventually they need/want to move on. Like a house flipper or car dealership, eventually the ""carrying costs"" will eat up any profits.  At some point it makes more sense to make money elsewhere."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs good news because now they company will have a bunch of liquid capital and can start expanding and increase their revenue stream. GameStop as a base company kinda sucks tbh, there‚Äôs a reason they were shorted so much. Making these moves is how they will become the big e-commerce company all the DDs done try and point them to being. 

If you‚Äôre trying to swing trade and play the short game with GameStop then an offering is bad to an extent, but if you‚Äôre long on the company like the majority of people here say they are then an offering is a good thing because it shows they‚Äôre ready and trying to grow as a company."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah they just gave notice that they want to be able to sell UP TO 3,5m shares whenever they want to. (They know the squeeze is coming and want some tendies too)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes they want to profit from the squeeze. Smart af people there. Bullish ü•≥
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,'Up to.' saw that later.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're not, they're reserving the option to"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"For a maximum of $1b in proceeds, about $285/share max."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah so how is this good news?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll wait and see how will price behave after open. Part of me wants the price dip back to 40.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol.  Yea, did you read that on yahoofinance?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dont repeat MSM news, it makes you look very uninformed."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Please read again.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dilution capped at 5% so not that much. If they manage to rise even only 300 mil with that dilution they could pay off all loans and it it would rise EPS by around 20% (have to look up actual numbers). But IF they sell, it would be better to fuel transformation and growth."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Up to 3.5 not 350. Also it‚Äôs either up to 3.5 mil shares or up to 1 bil dollars.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"But nothing really changed since yesterday. Only thing that change is the amount of capital they can rise IF they decide they sell shares. 5% dilution is not much. $1 bil is a lot if managed properly. Yeah I am bullish AF.   
  
By the way: 5% is not 'drastically'. And not 'further', they actually reduced the float so please don''t  spread misinformation."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,People that didn‚Äôt buy at $40 regretted it. People that don‚Äôt buy now will regret it. The best time to buy was five months ago. The next best time is now. Squeeze or not $185 is not the peak. RC turned a fucking dog food company into a billion dollar company. If you‚Äôre gonna jump out of the rocket the second you see it hit $200 though then don‚Äôt get on it at all. Do your own DD stop asking dumb shit. But what the fuck do I know. Im a crayola aficionado.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In no event will the Company sell more than 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock under the ATM Offering, and aggregate gross proceeds will not exceed $1,000,000,000. There will be no sale of Common Stock in any jurisdiction in which one would be unlawful.

So at max its like 285$/share


Edit.

**There's been mentioned couple of times that they could sell example only 100 shares and get that maximum sum of money from those shares**"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the Ape Language TL;DR.

This is GameStop getting their tendies.  Nothing more.  Yes, there is a little dilution, but since (we believe) we own the float, it won't change anything."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Average down.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"good for the company. it can get money that it needs to rebrand/adjust

bad in the short term for holders."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Means the company is selling new shares to make money which they will put into the transformation of the business.

Its dropping most likely becuase this means already existing shares will be dilluted slightly."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GME may sell some of its stock at the stock market when they feel like it to get cash.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Just securing some tendies when this moons about 3.5 million shares worth smart move by them
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME Wants some bananas when we go to the moon for a banana run. They didn‚Äôt try to get greedy and put the banana run at risk, they just want a modest sum of 1 billion bananas. And there are a lot more than 1 billion bananas to be had on this moon run. Enough bananas for all apes and GameStop to feast like king apes, a sort of King Kong if you will.

In the meantime, it‚Äôs a great opportunity to pick up some shares at a discount so you too can have more bananas when we leave earth. 

More technical version for apes with a single wrinkle. If you believe the dd that says shorts are at 200-900% of the float, this does fuck all to that number, and squeeze is still a go. Bullish if anything, because it means GameStop is going to get to capitalize on the squeeze and put a billion dollars in their bank for their expansion plans."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Its bad for the short term and that is why most of us are here for the short term
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol  how is shares dilution good if you're still hoping for some massive squeeze you guys keep talking about?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless you are holding GME above $25, it‚Äôd actually bad news.

Which you can see on the market."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No they didn‚Äôt. It says they will be sold from time to time up to a maximum total of 3.5M shares.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,agreed but it is better in the long term (for existing shareholders) than issuing new shares though when considering market cap
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"i think this $1bn is a TOTAL limit set by the legal regulators as to the max that GME can profit from the squeeze though, becos if not it would be insane

gamestop would still have the flexibiliy meaning to say if the price shoots to $1000, they can only sell max 1m shares

and if price is max $285, then they would sell max 3.5m shares

total cap @ $1bn or up to 3.5m shares"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,1 Billion OR 3.5m shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"they don't have to sell all shares 

either they sell 3.5 mil or sell some for 1 billion dollars they can't go beyond either"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That's my play if it drops another $20.  If not I guess I can still buy and average up!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dilution is always a downward force on share price, moon/diamond hand candidate or not."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,exactly! finally somebody can give me more confirmation bias when in reality if the company believe in a short squeeze they wouldn‚Äôt be doing this! Change my mind!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, you know $500 would have been a good cash in price. You know, a price that happened months ago.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It might only be a fractional share... $2b/share is the floor.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They could even offer a fractional share through RH
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Very bullish.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"To cover short positions.  If you are unfamiliar with how the squeeze theoretically works, it will essentially force market buying to cover the shorts when they are margin called (to the best of my understanding).  Lots of good DD on the process out there."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The HFs who are being forced to cover and need the shares to cover would be buying those shares?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I appreciate this perspective. Is it really dilution though?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good or bad news ?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its good news for the long term yes, but people are wanting a SHORT squeeze for the short term, this might fuck us for the short term and end this"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, they do it ""from time to time"" aka every rocket launch. They're stealing our fucking fuel."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"A billion dollars share dilution, ""from time to time.""

Your math is completely drawn out of fucking nowhere. Their sales price is based on market, which, is currently at -14%"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lost a few bucks with AMC so i'm biased, but I sold because i'm not a fan of them using their 15 minutes of fame to make their Executives richer - I like GME's Executives much more"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe their own. Not sure though.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The fuck is the difference in your mind?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"From either perspective, it's only good for raising capital for the company and has a negative affect on the share price or any remaining squeeze potential."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">you can grab the stock on a bit of a sale?

Long term maybe, but there's no telling where GME will settle in the next 1-2 years. Is it $120 per share? $300? $500? If this stock is poised to grow from a stable $80 to $120 over a period of years, this is not a sale.

If you think there's a squeeze imminent that will push it to $500, $1k, $5k, etc, then yes this share dilution is a sale, so is current price, so is current price +100%, but the fact remains that share dilution hurts short term and reduces squeeze potential."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only way this is bullish is if they are also expecting a squeeze and using this as formal notice that they want to cash in on the squeeze.

Aside from that - raising capital doesn't always translate to anything positive, it doesn't ensure they capture any more of the market, it really doesn't guarantee or even suggest anything other than the company has more cash at its disposal. What they do with it, and whether or not it's used effectively, you can't say one way or the other.

On the flip side, there are things we know happen when a company dilutes stock. There's not many variables there. They will select an opportune time, and sell as many shares as they feel like, whether that's 3.5m or 100k.

>better max ceiling of 1 billion

What do you mean ""better"" ?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You're right it's 5%. I have no idea how I came up with 7.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"He invested 76 million of his billion dollars to try to turn gamestop into another chewy, somnehow. His explicit strategy is to compete with amazon, and presumably get bought by them for a rounding error on amazon's balance sheet. That's not terribly likely now, is it? Does that mean that he's going to compete with amazon on logistics, or inventory? Or price? Is he unaware that most games are purchased digitally either through deeply entrenched publisher platforms, or literally uninstallable marketplaces on consoles? 

The only draw that gamestop has is the consoles in store that let price insensitive teenagers who have just gotten out of school play demos. 

It's possible you don't remember the gamestop headlines in the first quarter of 2020. They were so near to bankruptcy that they labelled themselves an essential business in california so that they could participate in the opening day sales of animal crossing. The only way that is a sensible business decision to go up against the state of California to participate in the launch of a single game like that is if the alternative is bankruptcy.

There was a reason that there was short interest in gamestop."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is 3.5 Million more shares on the float though no?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You can offer it up at any price you want. But no one's going to buy it. They want institutional investors for price stability. They aren't buying at these prices.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, don‚Äôt get pissed. I‚Äôm making observations. I‚Äôm not in the right sub to actually get a decent conversation going. Every business increased their online sales last year. But you don‚Äôt see Targets or walmarts closing shop like GameStop is. 

Other comparable sized businesses that are also closing up physical sales shop, like bookstores, are going out of business for digital-only substitutes. 

GameStop is the last major brick and mortar video game shop remaining after all of its competitors have been bought out or put out of business. 

By all accounts, digital media and digital gaming is the future. Nobody cares about owning the disc anymore, especially since companies have stopped making the physical copy interesting by removing cool game books, maps, posters, etc. from the cases. Maybe GameStop continues to monopolize games in the digital market, but that will require massive investment into a new platform to do that. To me, that‚Äôs putting too much trust in millionaires to not grab the cash that is so blatantly available to them and run. Hope i‚Äôm wrong but it won‚Äôt surprise me if GameStop goes under and all the shares they sold at way over valuation become worthless and GameStop‚Äôs new execs (with no tie to the company or industry) make off like bandits. Not trying to be the gray cloud and i know y‚Äôall will hate to consider this as a reality. Just seeing if anyone else sees this as the possible end."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL my point is that rev fundamentals vs last year are not worth much when valuing this stock.

It‚Äôs just my 2 cents. As is, that‚Äôs how much a GME $5 put is worth: $0.02"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,1 person sold off. The volatility was fucking crazy.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did not make my self clear. I know they will issue (at most) 3.5 million shares.

70 million shares is the total avaliable number of shares after they have issued the shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs true. Dfv has shown a willingness to pay up as high as nearly $40 for shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"WSB: *Is there a chance this stock could tank?*

DFV: *No, it's money in the bank!*"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup that's what I thought!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">My uncle lost several millions betting against GME

Shouldn't have been betting *against* it. You're ~~can't come up with a nice word~~ insane if you honestly think GME has zero future.

You wanna know why I hold? To stop idiot hedgefunders from naked shorting ever again. I want serious reform, and I don't want them hedgefunders to be able to not lose everything if they get caught abusing the system like they always have. 

I just wanna buy a house, maybe a few nice cars. And a full overhaul of wall street, that's all it'd take."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah stop it, Reddit! Only this guy‚Äôs rich uncle is allowed to try and make money on the stock market!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry to hear about your uncle, obviously I am, but that's not the people that are being targeted by reddit. They're wanting to see the actual big dogs in wall street go out of business, the billionaire's, who bet against a company that genuinely can still have a future. And if your uncle had enough of his portfolio I'm gamestop shorts that it affects whether or not he can retire, I'm sorry to say it, but it wasn't an intelligent investment decision. Putting more than 10% of your portfolio into one year is not and will never be an intelligent investment decision. Sure, people like DFV make millions from YOLOing into stocks, but for every one person that sees an insane profit, there's 100 that lose all their money. I'm sorry to hear about your uncle, but if he's lost millions and doesn't still have millions leftover, then I have to say, yes, he got unlucky, but that's that diversification is for. Don't go blaming reddit."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine being so retarded that when you're trying to retire, you dump literally millions into one stock. Alexa, what is diversification?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">But for heck's sakes Reddit, it's April. Gamestop has no future; it is a dead company and you all know it. My uncle lost several millions betting against GME, which was and still is an intelligent investment decision to make, based on the market evaluation of Gamestop. He's not a big dog on Wallstreet. He's a man trying to retire.

>All for what? So you guys can turn 1 penny into 10 pennies? Utterly preposterous.


ahahahahah nice troll

Anyway you should listen to some of DFV analysis of Gamestop on Youtube.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino.
If he‚Äôs trying to retire he should not have been ‚Äòbetting‚Äô."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> All for what? So you guys can turn 1 penny into 10 pennies? Utterly preposterous.

So your uncle can turn 1 mio into 10 mio? Thats how profit and stonks work my guy.

> You're playing with people's money

They are plaing with their money. Your uncle wasnplayin with his. The guys on wallstreet where playing with theirs.

> He's a man trying to retire

If he has multiple million dollars to lose, he could already retire or kust invest in safe stonks that give a steady dividend and have a stable price. Don't invest more than you can lose."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> My uncle lost several millions

.
>which was and still is an intelligent investment decision

Cope harder."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Won't somebody think of the millionaires and hedge funds???
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"it‚Äôs not about the money, it‚Äôs to send a message"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is everyone downvoting what is obvious satire?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"When he bet against the stock he took away someone‚Äôs voice who believed in its future. He deserved to lose.

Maybe he shouldn‚Äôt have bet against stocks ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,UtTeRlY pRePoStErOuS.....GUH
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Enough to cause the start of retail panic selling. Downward pressure leads to more downward pressure.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you're broke, I'm sure you'll still blame it on the shorts instead of your poor decisions."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're about to lose a lot of money, more than you've already lost."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, in a pandemic where gaming has become America's favorite passtime. 11% growth is abysmal in the gaming sector when everyone was stuck at home."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, a pandemic where most gaming companies had record breaking sales because everyone was stuck at home."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you expand on this more? Are you saying people are more interested in buying stocks with potential rather than stocks that are actually doing well?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So you missed the dip?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It should be higher. Like 69420 dollars higher
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"We have done our DD and we all came to this conclusion that it should be 69,420.00 per share."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,*Not conspiratorial thinking*
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It was basically an ad campaign back in January where literally everyone had gamestop on their tongue. Even grandparents. If that's only worth an 11% boost compared to the same 9 weeks a year ago well...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,it doesn't... it needs to go higher like ZM level high!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Chill tf out he asked a simple question
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. Good reports often see a dip after. You're betting on the future of the company, a report that says they were exceeding expectations last quarter, for example, raises expectations for the future and simultaneously makes it seem less likely that they'll overachieve again. Like if you just played the best basketball game of your life people probably gonna think at the next game there's no way your gonna play that good again. So there's a dip.  

That's more or less how I had it explained. Someone smarter correct me if I'm an idiot."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs literally market manipulation.

The stock shouldn‚Äôt be anything over like $30 as it currently stands. Yes I‚Äôm holding also, but y‚Äôall delusional."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish for value investors but it chops the legs out from underneath a squeeze. So the short term 'squeeze' investors might paper hand. It is unquestionably the right move for the company though.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"From a corporate perspective it‚Äôs exactly what you would want to happen. It may drive down stock price in the near term, but it gives the company more cash to use for the business. If you believe in GameStop long term you probably like this news. I‚Äôm just answering the people who are saying ‚Äúsales numbers up, why stock down?‚Äù"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you dumb? They made a comment about the ability to issue more shares in latest press release. Shareholders don‚Äôt like it as it reflects they may pursue issuance. Issuance means dilution. The market is all about factoring in what‚Äôs happening looking forward. You‚Äôre probably the type of guy who‚Äôs portfolio is 50% GME, 30% PLTR, and 20% AMC. Talk to me when you can do more than rehash what other people post on WSB dip wad."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It wouldn't be legal to stop one type of investor from buying open shares and not another \*cough\*Robinhood\*cough\*.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,very much so. 3.5 million shares is just over a 1/3rd of the shorted shares (10 mil total)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I got three :-)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got to three! But I started at one, fuck I wish I had money lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha I wouldn‚Äôt blink
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I personally don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever see it go under $100 again, but you‚Äôre right to not FOMO into this if you can‚Äôt afford it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You've had 90 day to buy in under 100
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It may keep dropping hard when market opens. Pretty sure it will.ü¶çü¶ç
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes no sense. If you cant afford to buy at 165 open you cant afford 100.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You are correct
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh sure because all the sideways trading it did last week was TOTALLY indicative of good news.
Shut up, no one's impressed with your bullshit internet swagger"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao, at a $13 billion valuation?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"For GME 
Buy on the rumour, buy on the news
Edit: thank you for the first award! Save it for the dip u ape"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a casino
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"What rumor did people buy on, you moron?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow.  Actual words of wisdom or advice and it is by far the most downvoted thing I have seen here yet.  You apes all pretend you aren't doing this because you're greedy and yet you act like this.  If an increase in 11% sales isn't a sell the news i don't know what is.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You just gonna ignore the possibility of the squeeze or?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You should‚Äôve stopped at Buy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That is the opposite of truth.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol don‚Äôt forget they want to DOUBLE ( amc) total shares lmao. I saw this coming the last time they added shares then got massive bonus. All on the back of retail. Amc totally screwed their investors IMO.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Could you clarify a little further the differences between AMC's and GME's teased possible splits? I'm one of the newtards and I could tell there was a difference based on sentiment but I couldn't put my finger on it.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean cash for continuing operations TO GIVE executives bonuses.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah also they aren‚Äôt diluting the shares by 50% either. It‚Äôs a total win for shareholders and gme imo. AMC has destroyed their rep by diluting shares by 50% whenever they get the ability to.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes because gamestop doesn't even make money in decent years

AMC needs cash to keep on keeping on because literally nobody is going to the movies, as opposed to getting a measly 10% bump out of *everybody being trapped inside for a year with nothing to do but play vidya*"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They said they were looking to expand upon the ATM offering in their earnings report, so yeah we knew this was coming. And yes it is very bullish. GME with a billion dollar balance sheet is spicy."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, you think they're not going to pay those ex-amazon and ex-chewy executives fat bonuses for jumping on this retail investor free money train?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,From there plans it's cash to pay off debt could easily just be an exit strategy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do you see a brick retailer cutting into online sales?

They are shuttering there locations on military installations which is there most lucrative locations, by far. Writing is on the wall."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,A company will do a buyback when the management believes the stock price is cheap (usually versus their fundamentals). GME is not cheap versus the fundamentals. They also have to have the cash or attractive financing to buy the shares back. This isn't in place either.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol if they had announced a buy back that would have been been beyond Autistic retard Ape level 1000!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They are not selling 3.5 million stock. They are just saying that it is possible if they want to.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The share offering was very contentious at board level last last year and early this year.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How would they do a buyback? They don't have any money.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They already have 500 million cash on hand with not debt. Why would they even do this?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"From what I understand there was an amendment to the SEC this morning raising their amount sale amount to 1,000,000,000.  The ""announcement"" articles are fuddy as hell."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Separate news source.  They're planning to sell 3.5 million shares, not to exceed $1 billion."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If they're truly representing the company's interests they'd be foolish not to.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously. The only reason they haven't yet is due to concerns over the blackout period.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They probably have a duty to do so to ensure the company's health longterm
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the right price they will, not at this price, shares were trading sideways for 250-200, and 190-195"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,For what reason? They can eliminate retail locations to gain cash to expand and once they get appropriately valued as e-commerce they are fine
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you on crack? Why would they do that now, and not before? And why wouldn't they have changed the conditions before. Stop choking on your father's pipe"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. The time though is still uncertain.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They don‚Äôt need shareholder approval. They will begin selling the shares today
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"... may sell them at any time. WILL sell them, yes, the ""may"" comes from WHEN."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where are you seeing new shares mentioned? They said that was a possibility a few weeks ago, but I'm not seeing it on that release. Did they post the release and then edit it to remove that?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it dilution? Or is this GameStop selling shares they hold?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, equity offerings USUALLY send stocks down unless the market really, reeeaally trusts management's plan for using the money and management's capability to sell it. In this case, it just looks like management is signaling that their stock is expensive, so that might send the stock down momentarily. Another possibility for the stock decline is if the market was expecting results to be better than they were (even if results were good by themselves). THAT SAID with volatile stocks the response to earnings very often has nothing to do with the earnings or other clear triggers, it might just be good ol' GME vol."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You know they are just prepping for the squeezing. If it's shorted half as much as it's rumoured to be it won't matter
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs good for GameStop bad for shareholders but it means they will benefit directly from what has happened and they should. I‚Äôll take the L
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not new though. They've had this in place. Anyone who has read anything understands this was already in effect. They simply updated the aggregate capital they could extract from $100m to $1billion. This gives them the option to make money, along with the rest of us. Seeking $1b in capital is exactly what they should be doing from a fundamental level to help their transition. Even at the full 3.5m max shares, that doesn't dilute shit. Gme wants on the rocket too. Make room for them!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you say it's ""good"" it may not be specific enough. There's 2 groups of thought here. Is this good for the short squeeze meme stock play or good for the hold 5-10 year traditional sound investment play?

Is GME turning into a slow but steady space elevator or fuelling up the rocket?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">On one hand it's dilution, short bail, taking advantage of inflated price; on the other hand payed off debt that means lower costs, much quicker transformation and growth and off chance it's preparing to bail shorts Porsche style.

It's good if you're in it for the long term, it's bad if you're playing it for the momentum and if you believe the short interest % hasn't actually gone down much"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a measly 3.5 million shares, up to* max sell of one billion dollars."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your wrong, very wrong"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs only 5% stock increase, quite small actually and the market should be able to shrug it off, but expect wild swings today."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They are not issue new shares you retard. They are selling shares they already have so no dilution.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,We had double that dropped on quadruple witching day so chill. Buy and hold.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Perfecto. **press buy button**
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They should sell them @$1000. Still nice for the hedgies, also drive up the price."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not new shares, shares they already hold in their coffers.  
The changes they have done, is to reduce the number of shares for potential sale from 6 mill to 3.5 mill, and the maximum capital raised from this sale from 100 mill to 1000 mill.  
  
In short - They are bullish as fuck, and have the option to cash in on the MOASS."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah and market price is falling
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúDD‚Äù showing ‚Äúfalse shares‚Äù

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,this. they want in on the squeeze.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No more than 1B gross that isn't the case it would seem.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also can only gain up to $1 bil in value. So whichever hits first, $1 bil or 3.5 million shares"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's 3.5m shares or a max sale of 1bn. Could be 1m shares at 1k. They are setting themselves up for the squeeze just like the rest of us
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly I think they were trying to make it look like company already did so everybody wakes up to a sell off freaked out and does the same. Shit I just bought 5 more at $155 and said thank you üôåüíéüöÄ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, okay. Hey where's your mba from, or hell even your applied finance bachelor of science?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">The timing and amount of any sales will be determined by a variety of factors considered by the Company.

Edit: Drop in the bucket. And it's not 3.5m shares, it's $1bn, max 3.5m shares. $1bn/3.5m= $285.71/share üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"only 285 max if its all 3.5m shares, they could also sell 1m shares at 1,000 etc."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or just 10 shares for 100mil each.
They never said they will sell all 3,5m.
Just that they CAN."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôve done this so that they can sell those shares at what they see as the peak. They know what‚Äôs coming and they‚Äôre moving themselves into a position they can benefit too. Bullish move
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the shorts are at 200-900% of the flat based on the 800,000 words of dd that have been researched. This does nothing to that theory that would prevent the squeeze from hitting 1,000,000. 

This is bullish af to be honest. GameStop is just putting themselves in a position to raise a billion dollars of capital when it moons. 

Plus, it‚Äôs giving all of us with more than one brain cell a chance to buy at a discount price. 

I don‚Äôt want to be rich. 

I want to be filthy rich. This is great. If GameStop wants to be filthy rich from this too with me, who am I to begrudge them."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs good if your GME investment is based on the outlook of years, 5+.

If you are here for a squeeze, welp."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs such a minimal share sell. I mean the FTDs. And also. 3m of 78m (more shares than that out there!) I think it‚Äôs a well calculated battle tactic to make a count occur
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They don‚Äôt make money from existing shares being worth more. They sold those shares a long time ago.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"High share price doesn‚Äôt give them all that capital, it gives all of it to the shareholders"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you had the chance to earn 1 billion dollars, wouldn‚Äôt you?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, yes, one of the traders they talk about, out in the wild!

One with no understanding of the relationship of stock price to balance sheet"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You are missing how the stock market functions
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. If it does I'm putting more in haha
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can‚Äôt compare this to 40$, it‚Äôs balanced out."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its 5% of the float or 1 billion dollars.  Whichever comes first.  They can even get 1 billion cash offer for only 1,000 shares offered.  U know why?  Shorts need to cover.  lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bad math. It has no implications for the maximum share price. It means that the outcome of the interaction between number of shares sold and the price will not generate more than $1,000,000,000 in proceeds."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs if they decide to sell the full 3.5 million
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets, Just did the math and came out with the same results. Wish i Would have read beforehand. 3am on the west coast and my Adi hasn‚Äôt kicked in yet.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Implies that they can sell 1.000 shares for $1m/share or 1.000.000 shares for $1.000/share
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought more on the dip!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're not covered, but you can bet they're are setting up to profit on the way up and down after the squeeze. They're going to be buying calls and puts."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,tHEy DeFIniTeLY CovEreD
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No ape left behind includes Gamestop the company.  This is their moon ticket.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,For sure. The higher the price when it moons the less shares they sell to get to a billion. LFG apes!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or average up. Either way, it‚Äôs a buy!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"And good for buyers if you ""like the stock"". I need a lower price to buy in with some more shares so I'm actually excited for this bit of news."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not bad for the short term. The squeeze is either real or it isn't. I believe there is overwhelming evidence it is. 3.5MM shares will not affect the squeeze if it is real.

Right now is a great time to buy at a discount, and a bullish opportunity to make more money when the squeeze happens."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn‚Äôt it depend on when they offer the shares? Maybe they start offering them mid squeeze to capitalize on the inflated share price
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How can this be bad then? It is pretty easy to understand.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the people who believe a short squeeze is coming believe the 800,000 pages of DD that‚Äôs been posted suggesting that shorts are somewhere between 200-900% of the float. Institutional ownership will still be over 100%, and a dilution of 3.5% does literally nothing to undermine that theory. GameStop is just getting their documents in order so they can sell a few shares when the price hits 80085420.69

Bullish Af. GameStop issuing shares was the biggest cause of fear of the squeeze being undermined. And they‚Äôve just come out and said they won‚Äôt issue enough shares to undermine the squeeze."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the opposite, if you bought GME cheap it dropping doesn't affect you in the slightest. If you bought at the high 200 range, then it hurts you as your stock lost value and you can't sell for profit until it recovers.

If you are looking for an opportunity to buy more shares like I am though, then regardless at the price you bought it this is a good thing. It's really only bad if you are expecting to sell this week, which pretty much no one here is planning AFAIK."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's harder for the price of a stock to move dramatically if the amount of shares available for purchase are high (high float).

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It means they're issuing 3.5 million more GME shares to raise equity, which would drive the current price of the stock down"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe you understand how insignificant 3.5m shares are in this picture :)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So again you skipped the point that they haven't diluted since December 2020 till now and the max ceiling of 1 billion is better because before they could only offer shares to a max amount of 300 million. They also reduced the percent amount of shares they'd offer IF THEY WERE TO DO SO. I wrote that in capital letters because apparently you haven't taken note that dilution occurs when they dilute. Which they haven't nor will have a need as they have been eliminating their short term debt while keeping a healthy cash reserve.

What were your points again buddy?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also simple math, if they expect 1 billion with 3.5 million shares that comes to 285.71$ per share. Think on that for a second and than reply with a good argument not a washed up drunks argument with no backing."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Well it seems evident that apes A aren't selling and B are buying dips. So this comment makes less sense than your other.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll take the amount of downvotes you have to indicate you are correct.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your argument is very short sighted. 

From the actual business practice. They were predominantly brick and mortar company with sales disrupted by lock downs. Favourite pass time or not, they were affected. Hence the transition to e-commerce and same day shipping model.
Another thing you completely overlook is supply chain affected by pandemic. You can‚Äôt sell what you don‚Äôt have. The new console production, also affected by pandemic as well as precious metals shortage, also plays a part in retail sales. So although it makes sense in your head, you should critique it before you post.

Edit spelling"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, except Gamestop is primarily a physical store that is subject to lockdowns, closures, and retail restrictions. 

In addition, there was major shortages of its best selling consoles. Add that to PC component shortages, less things to play games on = less game sales.

Any growth at all is a good thing during Covid for a company that relies primarily on physical sales. A continued transition to online sales will further boost this and take advantage of changing consumer habits, while retaining profitable physical locations will allow Ganestop to benefit from competitor closures."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Usually by the time the actual facts/news come out, the price of the stock already reflects it. This means that the price is more likely to start going down on a good news, since the price already has peaked before the news came out."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The rumor is always more valuable than the actual facts, a ‚Äúrumor‚Äù could be beating earnings expectations by 200%, fact is they only beat by 100%.

Edit: a word"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"While the stock is doing well 11% increase will not save the company. 
Go read their annual reports and their debt asset ratio."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you know the stock is going to kill earnings, you could buy a month out and sell the day before the earnings call. Then buy back in after the inevitable dip (or just hold if you like the stock)."

Same with stocks. People were buying a bunch if struggling stocks over COVID and were selling when the earnings reports came back better than expected. There was a paradoxical effect where stocks performing badly were being pushed up in demand, and good news was sold off. 

People start speculating on speculators and it goes five layers deep."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think its a big deal for the short squeeze if they sell them during the squeeze. It will put a cap on how far the squeeze will go. I don't think anyone will complain if they sell the shares over 1k share price though.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone posted elsewhere that this was already in the SEC filing from last month and that it only changed the language from the previous year‚Äôs filing. 


The change reflects the expected increase of revenue that the company could net from selling shares at the significantly more valuable price, compared to last year‚Äôs share price.


I believe last year the cap was 100 million and they upped it to 1 billion, should they choose to sell shares.


Another post showed that they did not sell any shares from that 3.5 million since last year. 


I don‚Äôt think with will affect the squeeze; I think they want in on it. I did some quick math and that would mean they believe they can sell the shares at $285....more than the current price ;)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought people here liked the stock?

I mean, I could afford to buy it at 190, but I was already expecting it to drop eventually with how much the media was trying to hype it for short term investment. So I want to buy it at as low as a price as I can to get the most amount of shares I can."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which I did obviously, and now I can afford to buy more if it drops again. It wouldn't make much sense to keep buying a a high price, just save that money for the opportunities when it drops so you get more shares for your dollar. Especially when this isn't news to anyone who has been following GME, we all knew the company is planning to change its business model for about 2 months by now. And they clearly need money to do it, and their money isn't coming from selling games right now... which is the whole reason they are changing the model."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what I'm expecting as well based on all the paperhands panicking over here.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I cashed out of AMC because AMC is a piece of shit.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're not splits, they're share offerings where the company creates shares and style them on the open market for whatever the market buys them for.  Splits are when the company changes the number of shares by exchanging everybody's old shares with new ones with a multiplier difference.

With the offering more shares show up and dilute the value in your hand.  Say you own 10 at a $10 price per share and they do and offering.  All of a sudden your 10 shares might only be worth $9 each, but hopefully the company will be wise with what they do with the money and make your 10 shares increase in value.

With a split your 10 shares valued at $10 each magically becomes 20 shares valued at $5.   Your $100 is still $100.  Splits happen when the valuation becomes so high that it limits what investors buying.  Like it takes a lot more money to reach 100 shares to do covered calls, or if you're buying in an IRA you might have to save up to buy a single share.  When the price per share is lowered the barrier to entry is lowered and more buying, so often if a split happens then the example 10 shares at $10 each might quickly become 20 shares at $6 each.

$10 is probably a bad example, splits usually happen at higher valuations.  In general investors seem to like to deal with stocks in the $10-25 range."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously they can't just give bonuses willy-nilly if they cease being an operating concern.  Then they have to convince the bankruptcy judge to give them their bonuses or else they'll take their leadership skills elsewhere leaving the company...I guess in better shape?

Maybe the better AMC play is to invest in whoever will buys their assets at a stiff discount."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is also teetering on survival.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh they'll get paid, but you can't assemble a team like that by convincing them with just plain money up front.  And you flat out don't want to hire people who are just there for money.  Your top people will be the ones who want to be there and where whatever money you're throwing down is simply the amount necessary to justify jumping over.

Jobs aren't just about money.  The incoming GME executive team can certainly get money anywhere, they're coming onboard to be heroes because they want to be heroes and they want to shape something.

Get towards the top of something and a job and stops being just a job and paycheck.  Instead it becomes a challenge with glory at the end."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The squeeze is entirely based on the assumption that SI is not as reported but much much higher. So high in fact, that 3.5 mil is absolutely nothing. If you believe in the squeeze, this news does not change anything."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol if you think GME is a good investment at this price point for a long term hold, you're not very good at this."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,same lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think you can compare gme to anything really. It‚Äôs so completely fucked with we have no idea where it‚Äôs going or what it‚Äôll do. I personally believe it‚Äôll squeeze and when it does people are taking it personally after the initial squeeze was canceled that it‚Äôs going to be something we‚Äôve never seen before. Where that goes idk but I‚Äôm being serious when I say my floor is 5mill.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, og poster mentioned that. This might be play of the life time."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre a moron
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would shorts need to cover if GME themselves have capped it at 285$?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they sell to the shorts that are covering, I'm pretty sure that's collusion and illegal."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I have edited my comment after multiple mentions of itüôå"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How often they do give that kind of maximum value? Seems kind of big
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm having serious problems with reddit now, for some reason it posted my comment couple of times and than I delete them and some wizardy monkey stuff...

But yes, it's true it can be also like that."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No they're gonna sell 3.5 million shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"lmao

if you're short stock calls is a hedge. Limits losses but can not yield a profit"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How can more available shares be good for you if you're aiming for some short squeeze? Explain me if it's pretty easy to understand.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, so what I said? Good news for fundamental investors (company taking profits from the bubble to fuel growth), bad for just about everyone."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure. So to fuel that rocket, they issue new shares to make the squeeze less dramatic or even cancel it? They didn‚Äôt sell, they didn‚Äôt split, the issued more."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because they want to be able to raise money by selling shares if this blows up.

Look at it this way, before they could only get 100m dollars. Now they've upped the cap to 1bn dollars, but added the language of ""we're only going to sell up to 3.5m shares"".

If you believe that the 44m in deep ITM calls are hiding short positions, then this will not even cover a tiny bit of those shorts; maybe around 5%.

It's a clear message to retail that they won't kill the squeeze, but they will take advantage of it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"People who think GameStop wouldn‚Äôt issue shares on a huge run up are insane. They don‚Äôt benefit at all from all this stock action if they don‚Äôt issue more shares in the process. 

Of course they‚Äôll do it. They‚Äôll do it now. If it hits $1000/share, they‚Äôll do it again. And again. And again. And if you guys truly care about the company as much as you claim, you should be happy about this."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Except they haven't sold them yet so they haven't done anything. If they are going to sell then they will do it on market open because they only see the way down from here correct? Let's see at open then shall we? They are preparing for moon so they can make some money too
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are correct. However the point of this is to raise money to keep GME from going bankrupt and to push forward with their plan to renovate the company. This actually is ideal for those holding GME, since the biggest risk is GME as a company falling off the face of the Earth. This action is intended to prevent that from happening.

For me this is good, it just gives me an opportunity to buy more shares at a reasonable price since people are going to panic and sell probably at pretty low prices."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop can‚Äôt force a share recall. It‚Äôs not a thing. Holders of the shares can refuse to do it.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have fun at sub 100 bud, i'm all for the transformation but yall forgot the simple supply/demand concept. They offered shares which will kill the squeeze, itll help them transform the company but geuss what, the squeeze wont happen and now everyone will panic sell. Have fun being a bag holder for 5 years"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Be a bag holder all you want fam, read the data without having your bias and you'll understand. The share issuing is good for the company and it kills the  chance of a squeeze, have fun selling at 250$ in 5 years"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,bc you shudve bought at $50 when everybody and their mother knew about GME and it‚Äôs squeeze potential. How the fuck are you guys still looking for entry points?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah they didn‚Äôt have papa Cohen. We in good hands lads. üíéfuckinü§≤
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that's where we are.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure why this chaps being downvoted. Few million more shares for covering. Unless you‚Äôre long on gamestop this isn‚Äôt the best news.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Or yall have drank so much hopium you are blind.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That makes me less concerned. Thank you
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,And after he went in front of congress
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"He also did it first. When he did it, the general consensus was that it was a poor investment. By the time most of us got in, it was proven to be a sure thing to anyone willing to look at the facts."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">you're just bag holding months after the scam ended. 

I avg'd down to $87 after my first buy in at $312.01. If it dips under $50 again, I'll likely buy more. I could give two fucks about it's current price, since I'm not selling.

>using bizarre conspiracy theories and teenager logic, because you're too weak to simply admit that you made a mistake and got hustled.

I like the company, I think they can come back. I don't wanna see another Toys 'R' Us happen. That and the amount of naked shorts is far too high. The amount of murder hedgefunds can get away with is far too high.

>It has to end eventually.

Duh.

>Give up the ghost and try to salvage some portion of your original investments then get on with your lives.

You're obviously a day trader. I'm long in the company, because I believe in it. While I would be up a couple grand, that matters little to me. Supporting a company I believe in matters more to me. 

I'm willing to hold for years or decades.

>(and in the future, go to Ed Jones or HR Block if you want to invest in the market). 

Lol, nah. There's a video of an investment group guy saying a monkey could do a better job chosing what to invest in. I believe that he's probably right, and since I refuse to invest more than I can reasonably lose, seeing as this is a casino after all... I don't see why you're so upset.

Edit: Wait, since when is investing in a company you believe in a scam?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean ""his house"". Anyone can invest in the stock market."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will expand further and you cannot stop it.
Don‚Äôt make the bet if you can‚Äôt pay the debt.
Retail investors are here to stay."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you don‚Äôt believe in the worth or future of a company, just don‚Äôt invest in it. Shorting just takes someones voice away and can destroy a company IMO.

Just the practice of shorting is what got us here."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Then how do you explain why GME is down 15%+ if nobody is selling?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs the way it goes these days in wsb
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for putting this in a way my inbred ape brain could understand.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright cool, so buy more GME after earnings, got it"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a fantastic way to explain it clearly and concisely.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ooooooooooh
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Usually by the time the actual facts/news come out, the price of the stock already reflects it.

Gotta love the insane amount of insider trading that the SEC completely overlooks."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I just wanna buy more stocks I'm find of. Cars are for kunts with posable thumbs anywho.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can't speak to today's dip, woke up saw something about a stock offering so just finished reading the supplemental report filed by gamestop to see if I needed to worry and that's all I've done today, so I can't speak to today. Sounds like they're focusing on that filing which (as far as I can tell) is simply increasing their $ cap on any potential share offering from a max of $100M to a max of $1B on (i think) the same max of 3.5M shares, which indicates potential of $285/share. But focusing on an angle that could make you think they're gonna stop a squeeze when I think they're trying to be ready for a squeeze and I believe just announced Friday they're gonna get a new Chief Marketing Officer."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends what info you believe. If you believe that yahoo finance is correct with only 10 million shares short right now then pushing 3.5mil into the market would obviously end the squeeze big time. However, I don't believe that data is correct, and neither should anyone. So who knows what impact it could have."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about? The debt ratio has no bearing on an at-the-market equity offering. They are approved to issue 3.5mil shares or $1bil total. They will get up to $1bil in cash. What does that have to do with ratios?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got downvoted by 3 people who got butthurt that I called out WSB‚Äôs love children, not people that are actually educated in Finance. Doesn‚Äôt phase me, they probabaly have 3 figure account balances. I made 300% off the AMC jump so I‚Äôm right there with you. Easy to make money off people that have no idea what they‚Äôre doing and don‚Äôt understand fundamentals or mean reversion. Don‚Äôt get mad at me that I answered the question someone asked. If GME didn‚Äôt drop because of the at the money offering then give me another reason. I‚Äôll wait."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I will own every share
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, we might see some board members dumb a few million shares this week so set your alerts."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens in April?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Just take the L fam
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. A lot of people bought 1 or a few at the end of January. Geez. Has it been that long?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That is inaccurate.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah.  Which is part of why I don't get the rabid downvoting of reasonable post.  Nobody should care about fundamentals and numbers.  Sell the news is an old adage that newcomers should get used to.  You have to learn to see both long and short arguments of anything you invest in.  I'll hold my long position and defend bearish sentiment any day.  We get nowhere by covering our ears *lalalala I can't don't hear anything*.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Duh, AMC is owned by Tencent.  Idk why anyone thought AMC was going to be a good play.  Tencent doesn't need any help."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I buy a few dips and sell when it jump for a few extra bucks until I can get another gme ;)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC up 16% today while GME down 4% LOL
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I used the wrong terminology. I meant dilution when I said split. Thanks for spelling it out."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good thing they gave those fat executive bonuses then, that should help the company survive."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell shares to buyback shares - quick get GameStop on the phone!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,not enough to do a serious buyback at current prices
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"not enough cash for that lmao, but enough cash to survive"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought they had almost 600m on hand
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup 600m iirc
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, $500 million. Chump change. /s"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,lol what is that enough to run the business for a quarter? 500 million is nothing.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They said they have cash
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn't my friend Jim Cramer just want to make me money?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is also acting as very good advertising.  As long as this is happening they are getting free advertising everywhere.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It said it was enough to fund current existing operations not growth but...

GME's stock play isn't about fundamentals anymore anyway.  It's like TESLA, it has such a cult following and people just like the stock it seems."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not happen has nothing to do with it, if anything this is for the MOASS.  They are saying, 'Hey, SEC, we want permission to sell stock for a value of 1 billion for our treasury.'  They already had permission, they changed the dollar amount, so they are saying the stock will go up significantly and they are allowed to take advantage of the squeeze for 1 billion worth."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why should they. They will not be able to raise the 1 Billion at the current price.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll bet you 50$ that it won't happen in a week. It's just 50$ so even you should be fine with such a wager.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because they wouldn‚Äôt announce it if they weren‚Äôt prepared to do it.

Tesla used the same language. ‚ÄúThe company will, from time to time, sell additional shares‚Äù

That ‚Äòfrom time to time‚Äô portion is bullshit. They sold their entire allotment in 2 days. It will be the same for GameStop

If they weren‚Äôt planning on selling a shit load of shares in the near term, why would they expand the offering?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Updated filing, they have the option to sell these, but dont have to. If theyre bullish about the stock, they wont sell till its exploding in price. 1b max sale at 3.5m shares means to maximize it has to at least be somewhere around $265  a share. Higher it goes, less stock they have to sell. Just allows them to capitalize if a short squeeze happens.

Edit: $285 a share, not $265"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats a renewal of the stock offering program that already existed.  They changed the dollar value they can buy up to however.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but the cash goes right into their treasury so the value of the company hasn't changed. And it's not like they need to burn through the cash to keep the doors open.  This is strategic cash that they will spend with an ROI in mind.

edit: yes, still technically dilution but, what?  5%, maybe.  The share price fluctuates more than that intraday and this is a bullish move to invest in the company."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I think there was a corresponding demand. If I could buy at $160 I'd be listing my cat on Craigslist rn
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So if the price goes down I can buy more. Got it.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shareholders short term, like today, who knows what will happen."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Current shareholders are in for a possible squeeze though. The current price is as high as it is because a shareholders are expecting a squeeze. Without any short interest, the stock would be a lot overvalued so them slightly increasing their value by using new capital for smart investments doesn‚Äôt mean a lot, they are still overvalued without a possible squeeze."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,onlyfans
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I meant to grab 3 today.

Changed to 5 with news"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same here and with 3 minutes left, it looks like I'm just strapped in for the ride."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I figured and I‚Äôd figure your edit the comment for clarification. 

Not sure why editing is a big deal in Reddit."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yes üëè
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Price droped from 400+ to 50? Many of us sold to make crazy gains there. Same like last run up.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"People are already selling at this very moment. Doesn‚Äôt mean people won‚Äôt buy up the shares again, but people aren‚Äôt diamond handing as much as you want to believe."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering that it tanked premarket, lots of people are selling. Do you not understand how market pricing works?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,3.5M shares is nowhere near enough for that
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,With 3.5M lol nah
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Or 1 share at 1b.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Karma farmers?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why wouldn't they want to sell at a possibly anticipated higher price when there's a 1bn cap anyway? Less dilution and not pissing off investors as much.. Maybe the shares will go to insiders (RC?) too, since according to the wording they are not limited to selling through public markets."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,285 but ok.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know it was possible to buy GME at prices below current, right? In fact, they used to be quite a bit cheaper a while back."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Must you reply to every comment? I‚Äôll follow you just so it isn‚Äôt missed, bot bye"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only chance is if it gains the crazy media hype and the stock doesn‚Äôt get limited for it to gain big heights. If it doesn‚Äôt gain media hype it‚Äôs pretty much balanced out now, not saying it‚Äôll stay stagnant but no crazy high YTDs imo. I‚Äôd love to be wrong and see people gain loads of money though. But 5mil? Like...per share?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its 3,500,000 shares or $1 billion offer.  This means whichever comes first as well as up to their choice as to how much they decide. For example, lets say the squeeze happens and we evidently moon to 1,000,000 per share.  GME has the capability to offer 1000 shares for a total of $1 billion."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They wouldnt be selling directly to the shorts but publicly offered.  During the squeeze, a demand is needed but supply is low.  Offering X amount of shares at XY price forces the Shorts to cover at XY price per share."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No they're going to sell either 3.5 million shares or $1 bilion dollars worth of shares, whichever comes first at the point they decide to sell."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,At $283 a share?  Ok.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"3.5m shares (from time to time), 1bn cap! If they just wanted to raise money, they would offer a lot more shares. 3.5m shares at 1bn max is just a puny dilution of the company. Just about 7%. Nah. To me this more looks like getting on the rocket. The way this share offering is prepared, they could easily go and grab that 1bn when the rocket launches. If anything. I like the stock even more now. But ofc. I am an idiot. I have no idea what I am talking about. I could not give financial advice ever. I pay 1 dollar for 20 cents often. kokokoko"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you on about? They are selling 3.5m shares at some point which will mean there are 3.5m shares available
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,People here are brain damaged. At the market share offering= no impact on squeeze potential!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get the long term view, I just think if anyone bought in on the idea of a squeeze they now need to reassess whether they like the fundamentals and a long term hold.

Not necessarily one and the same!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The squeeze happened twice. From $20->$480 and again from $40->$350. I‚Äôm doubling down my puts.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,no it wasn‚Äôt. $166 at 9:35am. [proof](https://i.imgur.com/wINuzyj.jpg)

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Quite simple math dumbtard! At least in my personal opinion. I have no clue though. So do not listen to me.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,He is not a cat.  I like that meow.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The fuck?  Security!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL!  Okay, guy, you got it all figured out..."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,*House of cards*.  He built it; he knows how flimsy it is.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure it will; this is lining up to be **exactly** like our last turn-of-the-century populist retardation party, complete with the morph into fascism.

In the short term though, the SEC will absolutely act to eliminate amateur investing entirely.  It will likely be too late by then though.

*Good times!*"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but if you actually believe in the worth of a company, and I don't mean just that you will be able to sell the shares to someone else at a higher price, I mean that you actually believe the shares are undervalued for what they represent (the right to future cash flows and assets of the company), why would you be mad that someone is willing to sell it to you at a lower price? Look at it this way: lets say you could buy a stream of cash flows: someone is going to pay you $1 per year for eternity. The market will sell you this for $10, and you think its a good investment because you think this should actually be worth $11. Now a short seller comes in and says ""Hey, I'll sell you that exact same stream of cashflows for $9 instead of $10."" It shouldn't really matter to you if they're doing it because they think that it should only be worth $8. Or, maybe they've *already* found someone else willing to sell them that same stream for $8, and so they're selling it to you for $9 to lock in their gains. Unless they're trying to manipulate the value after the fact (like by selling >100% of float), should you not be happy that you're getting the exact same thing for a cheaper price?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMO, shorting isn‚Äôt the problem, shorting and cheating to manipulate the price using shady tactics to ensure you win is the problem. Is it possible to have one without the other? That I‚Äôm not sure about."

You keep saying that.  What the fuck is this ""voice"" you're talking about?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Only -15%? We were expecting -30%. It‚Äôll be back +5% tomorrow.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Down 15% on 112k trades earlier on. Yeah nothing fishy going on. Nothing to see here, move along lol."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre trying to talk sense to people who might as well be posting their GME dd in r/conspiracy. I wouldn‚Äôt bother.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hello step brother
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically, the news has already been ""priced-in"" if you will."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm hardly a GME apologist/fanboy, but, I have a position. There is no way in hell there are only 10 million shares short. Is it going to $1mil? I doubt it. But from everything I can get my hands on (even outside of Reddit, GASP!), GME is shorted from here to eternity. Best case scenario for short positions is 50% shorted. I personally think closer to 80-90% of the float is shorted. It's going to be an interesting few weeks, nonetheless."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats why I said it depends when they sell and if they sell during the squeeze it will put the brakes on it. But no one will complain if they put the brakes on the squeeze like 500% higher than the current price. 

But I guess like what you're saying if the shorted shares are way higher then it wouldnt even put the brakes on the squeeze and would just get eaten up."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Debt ratio is a measure of how well the company is managed.

Doesn't matter how much stock they sell if they have SHIT management."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is trying to dilute it by half in order to raise cash to survive while GME is diluting by 5% to take advantage of a the soaring stock price as a debtless way to fund the changes WSB have been looking forward to.  It's a world of difference between the two.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They needed that extra incentive or else they would have just phoned it in.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll be honest, my confidence in GME got a little shook when Cramer came out and supported it. The dude is wrong on pretty much every single pick he does.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah also that. I just want to point out that FUD narrative of ""It has Squozen so exit your GME"". Im just an advocate of the company in the long term price of 600 to 1000. So if it is really has squozen, this is still a good price in the long germ."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you actually read what treasury shares are, you'll realize that it doesn't conflict with my statement. It's just a line item to shore up a balance sheet.

&nbsp;

From wikipedia on treasury shares:
A company cannot own itself. The possession of treasury shares does not give the company the right to vote, to exercise preemptive rights as a shareholder, to receive cash dividends, or to receive assets on company liquidation. Treasury shares are essentially the same as unissued capital and no one advocates classifying unissued share capital as an asset on the balance sheet, as an asset should have probable future economic benefits. Treasury shares simply reduce ordinary share capital."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Checked your comments, looks like you're hard at work spreading the overvalued unless it squeezes message.  I disagree, and more importantly a lot of others who have taken the time to put together really solid DD disagree.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kinda is.

The short squeeze theory relies on the idea that there are no shares available to buy, thus driving up the price indefinitely. Now 3,500,000 shares just became available."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It hasn‚Äôt evened out imo. I don‚Äôt know if you can tag other subs but the GameStop sub got infiltrated same way this sub did and started kicking mods and deleting and banning people. Why are people still getting paid to infiltrate the subs? There‚Äôs too much fuckery for me to think it‚Äôs over. That‚Äôs what my guts telling me. I think we‚Äôre going to see a market crashing event.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you miss the part where they dilute? They are not just selling, they are ISSUING NEW SHARES.

They are selling shares that did not exist in our previous scenarios. There are now more free shares for the shorts to play with.

So unless WSB can cough up a billion EXTRA dollars, it WILL reduce the pressure."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"its 1/3rd the total shares shorted.. so yeah you probably shouldn't listen to this guy, as he said, he's clueless."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In part, the companies success can be determined by how much capital they have to invest back into product innovation.

They go public to raise capital to fuel their future goals. If people are shorting the stock this might create panic in an otherwise stable company with goals that align with my own in this instance. That panic might cause a sell and loss of capital for the company, slowing them down and extending the timeline for future initiatives.

So because I want the company to meet its goals and succeed, I do not want them to lose capital from shorts or manipulation by shorts.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

We have now seen the huge potential harm short sellers have on the market. Because of this, we started to see people moving their investments outside of stocks. This created a cyclical process of shorts seeing an opportunity to short more, causing stocks to further drop and causing more panic. The prices spiked back up when shorts covered. People started buying again in part, I‚Äôm sure, because they saw this spike as a sign people are investing again.

One thing that worries me is that shorting stocks has become glorified to some extent by the news as a quick money maker for every investor.  There are now companies that are being shorted even when there is good news about them.

People are becoming even more skeptical about the markets and I think it will eventually start a huge sell off, with shorts initiating the panic and accelerating the crash.

The SEC put tools in place to mitigate short selling manipulation like failure to deliver, interest etc... but clearly they have found loopholes. These tools were put in place to make sure our markets  among other things don‚Äôt crash like they did some time ago in London.

[Short selling that caused the great London crash](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù I am referring to is the investor that bets for the success of the stock because they believe in the company‚Äôs ability to succeed.

Short sellers bet against the stock. When they short the stock, they drive the stock down. This issue I bring up about ‚Äúvoice‚Äù becomes even more apparent when a stock is shorted over 100% of float.

Shorting might make sense to some as a way to tell people ‚Äúhey, this stock is overvalued.‚Äù But clearly as of late, it is more about the perceived monetary gain that people think they can make jumping on the bandwagon rather than the actual outlook of a company.

There are systems in place (like interest shorts have to pay) to mitigate market manipulation and to check the shorts by saying, ‚Äúhey maybe you are wrong about your position.‚Äù Unfortunately there are loopholes that allow them to clear their interest (check my previous posts to see the DD I shared from another user).

If you are a person that jumped on GME just to make money, or are someone who is shorting GME than you won‚Äôt get it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs always nice to help a Step-relative get Unstuck. My stepmom is always getting stuck under the coffee table. She‚Äôs funny.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,People have been saying it will be an interesting few weeks all year and we've had one maybe two actually really interesting weeks the whole time...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Where have you been for the last two months? Obviously not on this sub. Because all this sub pushes is how GME is turning over their management team and replacing incompetence with competence. I hope you fucking short GME so when it moons you get btfo you retard.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they can sell at any time as of today, but the article went out on Yahoo Finance which could have/ might still make people panic sell, which in turn could make the board members paper hand instead of waiting to sell higher. It sounds like a dumb thing for them to do, but don‚Äôt forget a lot of these people evidently didn‚Äôt believe in the future vision to begin with. So it‚Äôs kind of a Mexican standoff situation. Might be nothing, might be a delicious multi-layer dip."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol you're so triggered. 

AMC is the easiest play of the century. Calls ahead of news of theaters reopening/big box office weekends, puts the next day. $$$$

Meanwhile you're probably down 50% on gme"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its approximately enough to pay their 50,000 employees for 1-2 quarters."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but it has not squoze, the take away is, GME is the safest investment for the next few months atleast."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I wasn't thinking of that? State a bet that will be mutual. For if GME does an offering of the stated amount of shares (I think 3.5 million) in the next week to the public.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah the number of shares overall is declared somewhere in the incorporation documents I believe and is actually fixed forever. Well I'm sure there is a way to get a expensive ass team of lawyers to do it but there's zero point to doing that. I guess that's what a split is actually now that I think of it. Anyway when an acquisition or capital raising event is necessary they can sell the shares that remain that have not been given to **officers/employees/public** float/other weird compensation situations but that is certainly called dilution
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"IF they sell them. This isnt them saying they are selling. This is them saying they have the option. They could just wait, and if a ss happens then they sell."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm all aboard on the GME hype train, I'm holding some stocks as well (not a life-changing amount but not nothing either). I absolute **do** think it is going to squeeze and buying in now will be profitable. But I don't think people should jump on this train blindly and think GME will be a good long-term investment. I just think spreading statements like ""GME is worth that much even without a squeeze"" is making this sub less believable. I bet GME will be sub $100 in a year.

People who buy in should be aware that they are in for the short-term. I didn't see a solid DD that thinks GME is worth this much in the long-term but maybe I just missed it. I'd gladly look at them if you could provide me with some."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Deal.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I was just pointing out that many people sold. Thats why price went down. And many of us bought again with second squeeze and sold again. Saying that nobody is selling false.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and it's going to increase the pain even more when market opens."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do, and that's not what's going to happen in this case. GME will be down 20% eod.

RemindMe! 12 hours"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha as if any of you idiots have enough cash to stop this GME crash.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Drop in the bucket. And it's not 3.5m shares, it's $1bn, max 3.5m shares. $1bn/3.5m= $285.71/share üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, but considering only officially reported short interest is almost 3x that, this really isn't enough to stop anything"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you believe the short interest is about 5% maybe. Most DD has it at least above 50%. And with the offering capped at a billion dollars, anything above a $300 share price and they're not even allowed to dump the full amount, so you might bail out one or two big shorts but most would still get the full brunt of any squeeze."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"üòÇ yeah this company is like the blockbuster of video games am I right fellow kids? 

I view raising one billion dollars of capital that they get to time during a squeeze as pretty bullish. But hey, if you hate money, now is a great time to sell. 

I‚Äôm happy to buy your shares at a discount!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I smell Fomo... You probably go halfsies on a sandwich with Jim Cramer.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if the share price is $300 at the time of sale, how can that statement be true?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúEMT Training - $1,000 deaths."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, it says this:

*""In no event will the Company sell more than 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock under the ATM Offering, and aggregate gross proceeds will not exceed $1,000,000,000.""*

Which means two things:

One, they will not sell more than 3.5 million shares (though they could sell fewer shares if they wanted to);

And two, they will not sell more than $1billion worth of shares (though they could also sell the shares for less than $1billion if they wanted to).

So they could sell one million shares at $1,000, or one hundred thousand shares at $10k, or one share at $1bn, because all of those sales are *less* than 3.5 million shares sold.

But they couldn't, for example, sell ten million shares at $100, because that would be *more* than 3.5 million shares sold."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So they're going to dilute it down for $300M?  Not a chance.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"but it was $171 in premarket and then continued to dip. so it did go lower than premarket. premarket: $171 open: $166 what is so hard to understand?

edit: i don‚Äôt think you know what you‚Äôre talking about"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You actually lack iq
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right and I'm not saying short selling shouldn't be monitored or limited, but you can't deny it has a valid purpose allowing individuals to take non-conventional views and hedge exposures. Let's say I had a positive view on GameStop's management but was worried about a bad outlook for the gaming market as a whole (not I am, just an example). Well in a normal market scenario where most stocks are highly correlated with the broader market or their specific industry, being able to buy GME while simultaneously shorting a highly correlated stock to hedge against industry downside risks is a super useful tool for portfolio management and risk mitigation. Not that those are the goals of this sub, but just saying."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL!  Wow...you really have some bizarre ideas about how this all works.  

Keep tilting at windmills, if you insist, but please understand that you're a lunatic."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve seen her videos. She doesn‚Äôt seem to be trying very hard to get unstuck.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ""rumour"" is generally something the majority of good retail investors are aware of.

For example there might be a pending discussion between an EV company and the US postal service for replacing their entire fleet with EV vehicles. We know this because at a press conference said EV CEO maybe says something like ""we're in the talks with the US postal service, but no news yet"".

This isn't insider trading, it's due diligence. Every company has leaks. Those leaks are plastered all over yahoo news etc for weeks before the news is announced.

Sometimes those rumours fall through, but until something happens with that rumour (or hype dies) the price should theoretically follow the rumour.

If GME had a leak from someone inside of Gamestop executive team that says there's talks of a buyout, GME will tank whether you or I like it or not. 

Then when that rumour is confirmed or shutdown, the price will have already been affected by the rumour and typically will turn around.

But what's funny is that companies allow these rumours to stew. Some companies will allow rumours of a buyout to go on for months knowing full well that's probably not happening. This is where I think the SEC should poke their heads in, because someone is making money off of not shutting down or confirming these rumours sooner."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"From a fellow grammar/english pedant, thank you. Corrected."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"WSJ, Twitter, FT, NYT, SEC filings... I read a lot. I consume a lot of media. I listen to people's opinions on here, YouTube, etc. I own a media company and have a background in journalism, so I feel like I have a good sense of what angle the person is coming from and try to keep my emotion out of it. My brother is a broker, he has a Bloomberg subscription. I wore him out this Jan/Feb asking about short squeezes, gamma squeezes, etc. having him explain possible outs I may be blind to for the shorts to cover.   
In full transparency, I sold my entire holding back in Feb off of the peak. I made a very nice chunk of change. I rolled some of it back into more GME (not as much as I previously held) after it spiked up again. I thought it was done when it was hanging around 40. I actually had a limit buy set that missed by a few cents that I'm now kicking myself a little over, but, that's the game, right? My brother thought it was done. He still thinks it's done and this level we are at here is from brute retail holding. I don't believe it's the case, but I'm also happy with where the company itself is going. I feel like if it never squeezes and the HFs just keep kicking the can down the road forever, I'm fine with where I bought in, because I believe Cohen will transform GME into a $250/share-ish company, anyway.   
All that to say, I still stand by my own personal opinion that there is no way only 10 million shares are shorted. I'd believe 10 million naked shorts, and still raise an eyebrow in skepticism, but take them on their word. Total? My BS detector is going off."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock is up huge on the year. Its been insanely interesting every week as it builds support at different levels and moves about. I can see the frustration though if you bought at a high. Then you're just waiting to stop drowning. Give it time.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think from relatively new investors, your position will be common and understandable. But for people who have been in the market for a long time, shit even on WSB for more than a year, the stock has been moving in interesting ways since Jan. 13th and not stopped being interesting. ""interesting"" is honestly underselling it, its been gravity defying. For the old timers like the Cramer crew, its about as mind altering as a black hole opening up over the atlantic ocean. Unprecedented in many ways."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree and can't argue... but there are a lot of catalysts coming up on the horizon. FWIW, that's the first time I've uttered those words. I've been in GME since mid-December."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you want to talk about ""new"" hires?  


Okay Chewy guy, great he had success with a company with ZERO competition that was a start from scratch.  


The Nintendo guy that left after a year?  
The Amazon employee who they brought on, which with the way Amazon is going why would you come to GME which has a higher chance of failure?  


The entire sub is just beating a dead horse, GME and their ideas are 5+ years too late into the markets they want to break into.  


I wouldn't touch GME with someone else's money, it was / is a bad move, just because you like the stock, doesn't mean the company is going to last / do well.  


You can tell a lot more about companies by reading their financials than the stock prices, which is why you're a retail investor, you invest like you're looking at a shirt at target, oh jeez that looks good lets buy it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I do remember hearing something like a shakeup in their leadership due to conflicts about the direction to take Gamestop.

Okay Mr. Tough guy, let's not get too big for our own britches. I'm sure you're a financial statement expert that only buys undervalued companies based on your fair value modelling. Don't break an arm jerking yourself off. 


>you invest like you're looking at a shirt at target,

You seem to know a lot about my investment style already. Seems to work though, so what the fuck is your problem? You're probably just a salty üåàüêª that's done nothing but lose money all year so you feel the need to throw stones. Also, are you fucking lost? Do you even know what sub you're on you stupid bitch?

Sincerely, fuck off, and suck on my 75% portfolio return over the last two months bitch. In two months, when I'm -75% annual return, you can laugh at me, but not a moment sooner."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's like you people can't understand that you can own both
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I want to screenshot your numerous ignorant as fuck comments and post to wsb but I can't be bothered to give enough fucks. I also love that your MO is to run around spouting bullshit and then put ""another so called 'expert' redditor"". And you're oblivious of the hypocrisy because you clearly think you know everything and you're actually developmentally disabled lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. You don't build wealth by wasting it.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually have.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,He meant 2.0 guys
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I think his point is that selling under 285 will cost them profits because they will hit the 3.5M limit.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Most retail investors aren‚Äôt touching the market before open and HFS aren‚Äôt stupid when it comes to knowing about the squeeze. Definitely lowered artificially.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,12% = almost 20% good maths
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or, hear me out here, your interpretation is wrong.  Maybe just re-read the press release."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see where the confusion comes from; you're missing a key phrase in the statement.

It doesn't say ""the Company will sell more than 3,500,000 shares"".

It says ""*In no event* will the Company sell more than 3,500,000 shares"".

The key part is the phrase ***""in no event""***.

Basically, what they're saying is ""no matter what happens, we will not sell more than 3,500,000 shares."""
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,but the markets open at 9:30 and at 9:35 it dipped to a low of $166. it was not a straight line upwards. you absolutely do not know what you‚Äôre talking about if you can‚Äôt even understand a line. [this is the graph you fucking moron](https://i.imgur.com/j1JzzTu.jpg)

When I was a teenager I spent a lot of my summers on this beach reservation in Delaware and there was this one sand road that lined up next to the marshland. Since it's protected the horseflies evolved to being the size of locusts and bite and attack people with really painful bites. We blackmailed older cousins to let us take the golf cart they got from a relative for an hour for a stupid challenge. 

The challenge was to drive as fast as possible down this road and outrun the flies. You stop or slow down your toast so you had to focus. I floored it, get halfway down the stretch and the sand gives out under the tire and we flip. Threw us both, gets the golf cart stuck, we get attacked, and just completely all fucked up. I hit a rock and cut my lip and fucked up my tooth and the entire side of me was all blood-soaked through a new white shirt we were supposed to get a picture in later üò¨. Not only did it take a while to heal, but it also took 3 years for the bite scars to fade, and I was banned from driving the golf carts forever."

Now with the new shares being issued and hurting the short squeeze argument, people are doubling down on the multi-year value-play autistic thesis, saying that it is so undervalued after already going up from pre-covid $5 to $170. Mental fucking gymnastics, man"

Not gonna get RKT'd a second time"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The year is 2035. Covid has been cured. Humanity has become an interplanetary species. TSLA hits $700 but is rejected and trades downward.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"For a green day its been pretty boring. After the gap up this morning, nothing has really moved"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I am continually fascinated that TSLA is always out there doing its own thing. Barely follows the rest of tech or other EVs. It‚Äôs chart moves when it fuckin wants to lmao.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Life pro tip: never sell SPY calls

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,PALANTARDS WE MADE IT üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock futures are pointing upward, with small caps leading the charge. Russell 2000 up 1.5%. Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all up around 0.5% to 0.7%. That‚Äôs as of 0630.

This follows a better-than-anticipated nonfarm payrolls report on Friday. About 916k jobs added in March versus 647k expected. The fact that leisure and hospitality were the biggest contributors shows that the economic recovery is gathering pace in the areas that were hardest hit by the pandemic.

Seeing how stock markets were closed on Friday, we may be playing a bit of catchup to that news now.

On today‚Äôs economic calendar, we have ISM non-manufacturing PMI out at 0945. That should shed more light on the services sector of the economy. A reading of 59 is anticipated. Last month that figure fell well short of forecasts.

At some point if all these economic figures keep beating estimates, the inflation drum is going to start beating again. That will bring concerns about tighter Fed policy. We played this game last month and inflation concerns seemed to win out at times, even though the Fed stuck to its guns. 

Looks like that will not be the story for today. Bond markets are quiet so far, with 10-year yields mostly unchanged around 1.718%. Crude oil is down almost 2% but that‚Äôs due to OPEC production increases. Copper is higher though, by about 2.6%."

My Broker allowed me to sell Cash secured puts on Thursday (SPY) without having the money in my account at the time, got a credit of almost $200k.

Used the $200k to buy TSLA calls (they were down 35k at market close on Thursday).

Got a message on Friday asking me to deposit cash or sell securities to cover the debit.

This morning about 15 mins before market open the calls were **removed** from my account. No call, no message, no opportunity to deposit cash or sell the calls to cover the $200k.

There's gotta be legal recourse here, right? I've got everything recorded."

O____O"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"My take on what the share offering does. If you actually read and believe the DD about the new vision of the company and eccomerce and gaming then revenue up is good news and share offering is good news. They need money to fund that change and want to have a healthy cash balance in case of a massive deleveraging. 

If you just believe in the squeeze then this has to go through the SEC first. The government. Slow as hell. Meanwhile DFV will presumably exercise his contracts by 4/16 and the blackout period ends around the same time. Dont led FUD control you, think about all the variables at hand and make your own decision. I like the stock. Not financial advice. Pos 5 shares

Edit: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüíéüôå"

I have gone through the five stages of Grief, a.k.a ""5 stages of Palantir"".  


1) Denial as in ""How could this soon-to-surpass-30$ stock go all the way to 20 and then take a dump every other day so it keeps teasing 23 and back down she goes!"".  


2) Anger as in ""YOU PIECE OF @#\~‚Ç¨¬¨¬ø?!!!!"" as market is green like grass and PLTR takes yet another dump. Or it goes up a tiny bit and insiders sell it into oblivion.  


3) Bargaining as in ""Ok, ok, I may be able to sell if it goes back to 26. Make it 25. Ok, I'll settle for 24. Is it too much 23.75 to ask?"".  


4) Depression as in ""I could have made so much money elsewhere and I'm stuck with this dumpster fire of a stock..."".  


5) Acceptance as in ""Palantir will do Palantir things. Stop looking at it funny every 3 minutes and eventually you'll break even and move along to pursue other venues"".  


I regret nothing...except not having sold today at 24.40. I fucking knew she would tease me and purple ball me back into low 22s :(

I think the crash will be more like the dot com bubble, where we just lose a lot of value and not economies collapsing like the housing...however homes will lose significant value still, particularly in certain localized areas. As for the markets, I 100% stand by my prediction of SPY back to 200 before year end. Which is slightly over a 50% correction at this point. Of course it will be oversold at that point and probably start climbing to 300-350 range rather quickly, where I think it will end the year. But with the amount of margin and unknowledgeable retail traders in this market, you can bet the selling will be over-emphasized when it happens."

I picked up some ITM puts to limit the extrinsic costs of the position, and reduce chances of a 100% loss, since this is a fairly low conviction play. 

100 contracts of 4/9 410p, bought at $5 earlier today. Hopeful to sell for $8 over the next 2 sessions.

Currently down 7%."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its very misleading to assume price movement up or down is what contributes to options pricing. While yes it technically does, most of your options pricing comes from Implied Volatility or in other words, what is the likelihood the price will move in a given direction, by how much, and how quickly. THIS is how you need to think about options."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm seriously going to start doin this and get my cost basis down.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. As you know, stock price is a direct indicator of company valuation. For instance, Ford is trading at 12.40 rn. Which makes it about 18 times less valuable than Casio. This is how I do all of my analysis. I look at the share price and I say ‚Äúoooo that stock is a bit expensive. Very overvalued.‚Äù I think yes you are on the right path and have the correct rationale for your arguments. Continue doing this."

Wsb didn't save GME from anything other than a de-listing.  They have not profited off this yet.  Now they can.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Because of the dip and the GME filing to have the ability issue more shares. Which they are comparing to submitting an application without much intent to use what you are applying for.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme dying? Lolllll
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC diluting the stock with over 100% of current public shares doesn't seem to do much apparently so I'm sure GME will be fine too.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Retail isn't moving it 15% since open.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I made six figure profit. Beat the game, not playing it again. Although I could've done it twice. Who woulda predicted that. And don't say ""we did"" because let's be honest - y'all had no way to know it was going back over 200."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Because they‚Äôre obviously balls deep in it
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You have video proof of this?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one cares if people own it, they hate that they won't shut the fuck up about it and keep it in their own thread"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 16, 2021 $21.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

21 here we come!!!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk why you were downvoted lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the challenge of pleasing without the use of aids.. to me that's just like beating the game using cheats. Not the same feeling of satisfaction.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Meanwhile Target Walmart Amazon Sony Microsoft and Steam are making a killing lol basically every GME competitor is prospering.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"PT is $13 from the one guy who had it above $5

Same guy who has had only buy and hold ratings since its IPO

I happy that y'all are up today but one person who looks like a bagholder doubling his PT  looks more like a sell side advertisement than a serious position.

be careful"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao you realize there are multiple price targets and AMC's median price target is like $2 right?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,hurry before the sale ends
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea my $11 calls today were way too green, hammer down the price I enjoy the pain at this point."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought some when they started to moon.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yet how many people are bagholding pltr, rkt uwmc and all other shit pnd this sub created?

I like how you think its a gme thing"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell at open.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,200 probably ain't possible. Maybe 60
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Do the stanky leg!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs as good a reason as any........purchase approved
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,some analyst said to invest in amc and now everyone is...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME - no idea

AMC - an analyst upgraded their price target to $13 from $7 ; Kong v. Godzilla did pretty well in the theaters."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmaoo we think alike. My SPY calls saved my portfolio during the beating my AMC puts gave me
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,GME needed to do it though. The company needs the money to fund their change plan. They needed to also release the change plan at the same time otherwise its just causing fear.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do the fucking math... 1 billion divided by 3.5 million shares = $285 a share. Is that more than the current price? If so, then thats bullish"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tempted to get in later this week, as APHA seems at a stable price where it could breakout"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"From a technical sense, I like it because of the solid support, consistently higher lows since 3/8, approaching oversold territory, and the fundamentals on the business are pretty solid"

I'll bet she has the boots, whips, tight pants, and colour-matched tack, but can't lunge a horse either on the line or free.   Sadly, horse theft (sales of leased or loaned animals) is about as common as false accusations.  Now excuse me, time to go out and visit my pretty guy who follows me around at the shoulder, and obeys lunging commands from my fingertips.  A part of him is always with me...it's shedding season."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope. Cat girls are poor crazy. Horse girls are rich crazy.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't date cat girls because I'm afraid my husky will murder their cat.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What's wrong with catgirls? I thought we all love roaring kitties :/
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine is both... Surprisingly sane.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I just read that the rate of diagnosed mental illness among white millennial women is like 45%.  That‚Äôs bonkers.  Probably cause by living in crowded shithole cities and not having kids.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not theft, she didn‚Äôt steal the horse to sell it though..... she was loaned it - technically is exactly like a short sale.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Because by making it sound complicated they hope you don't figure out just how retarded it is.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I see what he did there too"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol, sounds like she‚Äôs more suited for a hedge fund"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha thank you
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it‚Äôs any consolation, ACTUAL sexual assault victims hate women like this as much as you do. I didn‚Äôt even bother attempting to report my rape because I knew how much of an uphill battle it would be proving it, testifying about it, seeing him again, our friend group taking sides. If women like this didn‚Äôt exist, sexual assaults wouldn‚Äôt go underreported because there wouldn‚Äôt have to be an assumption that ‚Äúwell she might just be lying.‚Äù Fuck anyone who tries to ruin someone‚Äôs life with so serious an allegation. It disgusts me that some women use a traumatic situation like rape as a tool to get what they want. I hope they never come to know what it‚Äôs really like, but goddamn."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The system is fucked up and one sided towards women, it‚Äôs all part of the plan.

Divide men and women in the west to make breeding as difficult as possible so they don‚Äôt do it.

Sad reality is it‚Äôs working as most western women nowadays arnt worth the trouble to most western guys.
Literally have to right off whole generations of them sadly, as the damage has been done.

Must have ruffled a few feathers with the truth as the downvotes begin lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I know. In my comment, I‚Äôm saying I misunderstood the wording, and thought OP was saying that she loaned horses out to one person, and then turned around and sold those same horses to someone else"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"she didnt own the horses, shes just a poor white girl who wants to be  a rich horse girl"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah i get to inherit her daddy‚Äôs money? I am down.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, men just put up with too much shit"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I honestly didn't this was a thing. I mean it makes sense but shorting cows just seems weird. What if the long guy kills the flock like in billions...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Never saddle up for the long haul.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, the horse girl puts the horse in the stable, not the other way around."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Also statistically crazy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,if you mean expensive and difficult to quit without injuring yourself .. then yes
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,In denial? :D
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exclusion to the rule, this doesn‚Äôt mean everyone is that.  Just majority."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,how come?  you might say i've been sexually assaulted a few times but i've never gone to the police with it
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dunno, maybe?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling a call.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Expiring soon, sorry wrong terminology"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I've never heard it explained like this.... Wow
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel attacked.......
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Crazy cat ladies maybe but from my experience girls who who one or two are pretty chill and like to cuddle.

If she's single and owns a dog though..."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends on the size of the cat.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude I *murder* the kitty üò∏
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have two, yup. I see what they try to do to rabbits. I‚Äôd imagine a cat would be similar"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The > sign means ""x is greater than y"""
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Narrator: *it was actually just a cat-girl with a horse cock*
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it's helicopter parenting and telling them while they were kids how special they are all the time. Participation  trophy generation (men and women). Single parent households due to nanny state and sexual liberation did not help either. 

When you think about it, it's system after system that failed over the last 50 years or so, and each failure reinforced more failures, all driven for profit. Social norm erosion destroyed core family dynamics, which destroyed personal responsibility, which destroyed educational system, which continues destroying political system and that in turns bastardizes our economic system. All cracks just continue to add up until we will end up at Rome 2.0. 

Who will be our Nero to play the fiddle I wonder."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree with you, but wanted to add that IMO the reasons behind it aren‚Äôt always as malicious as the more tinfoil hatty members of WSB make it out to be. Like every scientific field, there is a lot of jargon that evolves over time. At first it makes sense to have the jargon, but it gets unnecessary cryptic as the academic side of the field grows. You see this a lot if you look at economic papers on SSRN"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Done on purpose to confuse regulators and law makers so they could get away with murder. Hard to convict if no one understands what you did in the first place.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright, enough horsing around. This is a bit much."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if their *neigh*bours were witness to it all
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"We really ought to go back to the old system for dealing with those situations: you make a false accusation, you get the penalty the person you accused would have gotten."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sadly they ruin it for the legit victims, and force men to behave in certain ways to protect themselves from false allegations."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh my bad, I‚Äôm clearly a retard myself and can‚Äôt read that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm on this sub. Hahaha"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You didn't misunderstand; your original interpretation is correct. OP is a dumbfuck who doesn't know what ""loan"" means."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I put up with too many guys that think I'm automatically crazy because I'm female."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,alright guys let's rein it in with these puns. enough horsing around
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"True to form, I regret doing it years later. still find myself thinking ‚Äúmaybe I should,‚Äù but then I snap myself out of it lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That is STILL the more stable state for us.  Chew on THAT banana for a bit
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why are they crazy? My mom has been a hairstylist a long time and pretty crazy

Must be the dye"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you get free hair cuts
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Was married to a hairstylist. Can confirm.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aggressive sexual predators who are women don‚Äôt get thrown in jail the vast majority of the time.  So it doesn‚Äôt shock me at all that she has a nice house, good job, etc after putting a scar on someone."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I think so pal. God damn horse girls. It's a fucking epidemic
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If she's single and owns a dog, that girl is down for some freaky shit"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually it depends on how many cats.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Name doesn't check out tho...  
EDIT: AMG MY FIRST REWARD... thank you! Buy and HODL!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, fucking dog people are the worst. They're loud and shit everywhere."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought it meant eat as in crayons
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, AIDungeon :("
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Gallop did a poll... She fuqd
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if that was her mane source of income.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree 100%, granted that proof is given that you lied. Essentially, a person being found not guilty does not mean that they didn‚Äôt- only that there was not enough evidence to prove guilt. Same situation should be true for the woman. If there is enough evidence to prove that she made a false claim (and they damn near ALWAYS brag about it to someone or text the person they‚Äôre extorting/blackmailing that they will do it), then she gets what he would have. I just wouldn‚Äôt want a woman who was raped but couldn‚Äôt prove it well enough in court to get a sentence on top of it. See what I mean?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Chill mane
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The noxious chemicals that you constantly breath cause brain damage similar to fighters that get punched in the head too many times or football players. They become ""impulsive"" and have poor judgement which is considered ""crazy"" colloquially"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ughhh both are great in bed, fucking nuts though can confirm"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm, my rapist is on real estate billboards all over Charlotte, NC. 
University cops--you left your door unlocked, you must have wanted her to come in your home at 3:00 am and you were drinking underage."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh yeah i'm aware of this BS.  i was just throwing my own anecdote into the ring lol

the woman is actually quite fun and decent when sober but she's a nightmare when drunk.  totally obnoxious and has zero shame/respect"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"At least she had a bangin ass and a fit like a glove.  I had my turn before she was ruined by her ""need to have kids before she couldn't""."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"All true. But the really egregious cases tend to be easier to prove. Plus the threat of consequences would reduce them, as with the rape itself."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Should we stop the horse puns?

All in favor say aye.

All opposed say neigh."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Brrrrr

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No idea why dude‚Äôs mom is crazy, but can confirm she is good in bed"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking hell you are me hahaa. My one was after 5+ kids while being barely off minimum wage. Fucking sidestepped that one like a professional footballer lmao
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"There will always be men that get away with rape and women that get away with lying about it, unfortunately. But the consequences for both actions need to become more severe. Reform in the penalty would cut down the occurrence on both sides even if a 100% conviction rate for either crime were impossible."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let it ride, I say"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"My ex worked maybe 12 hrs a week and did nothing else.  I remember once she was gonna go buy 200 bucks worth of katanas from some flimsy import shop in the mall, 200 being almost her entire check.  She also seemed to listen to only Disney music: I loaned her a laptop and showed her how to YouTube to mp3, got the machine back with like 30 songs converted.

The red flags came hard and fast, but so did I in that 22yo.  I'll be chasing that high for the rest of my life like an orgasm junkie."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If she's your bride, you'll need a bridle."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Who are you telling üòÇüòÇ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought a 39 he bought a 40, and he bought his earlier than I did mine I believe"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It'll happen, I cant tell you how many million dollar trades I was off by 1-2 weeks. I'm 23 now and I trade full time, gotta love it"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Stock was around $40 per share on the 20th when he bought his call option and he sold the option 7 days later when it was $325 a share
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The only decent user interface for options and spreads üò¨

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is pretty much it
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You shouldn't be utilizing spreads from a phone imo but I suppose to each their own. Fidelity's trader pro on pc is magical if you've only experienced dinky RH interface.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a generally new idea. What I am unsure of is will I be able to sell them on Robinhood or will they freeze it? I want to buy while AMC is on sale
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm still trading with it, selling options now tho üòÇ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You must be one of the newbies here, these are called ""options"" they expire after a certain date. This is called taking profits. Welcome aboard"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options grant right to buy 100 stock per contract.
This one was 0.69 per share to buy the option (so $69 )
3 contracts so $69x3 for rights to buy 300 shares, so $207

Then you can exercise the options for strike price per share up until the expiry date, or sell the contracts on.

Current share value was 171.01 so
$177.01 x 300 = $53,104

Less 300 x his strike price he'd have to pay (unless its a cash exercise where the broker handles it) = the 24k profit

Edit: bigbrain13 works it out fully here showing its better to sell the option : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkdgy8/still_my_pr_looking_to_break_it_soon_here_too_the/gtftmfa?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"But then why not just buy 300 shares at $82.70 and sell at $177 since you‚Äôll be doing that with an option anyways when you exercise it and loose $207 for nothing? Also, that‚Äôs still technically not a profit of 11,000%."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying 300 shares is very capital intensive. 300 @82.70 is 25k that you would have to have yo buy those stocks. With options they bought 3, investing 207 in total. Since it is now worth 24k, 207 ->24k is ~11,000% return.

Also, a reason to go for options is that the downside is only 207 while the upside is technically infinite.

Edit: got confused on this, read later comments for a better explanation."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most people trade the options only, they never exercise them themselves as they don't have the money for it or don't like the stock enough, they just buy from an options writer or another options holder and sell them on again later before they expire.

Some brokers can offer cash exercise though, where the broker buys the shares themselves instead and gives you the cash difference (less a comission I guess) - not the shares, which they could keep if they think they'll rise, or sell immediately.

Warning: some brokers will exercise for you if you have enough cash on the account at time of expiry and they are In The Money, if you've not set it to not do this. [This guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/min4s7/i_forgot_my_contracts_would_be_exercised_instead/ ) forgot this and ended up with two hundred gme shares and a lot less cash on hand.

With an option Call you are betting on the share going up, and your maximum possible loss is what you spent buying the option even if they hit $0.
If you had bought the shares outright instead it would cost a lot more up front and you could lose up to 100% of it in the worst case.

Puts are similar but betting on it going down instead.

So people go for them as cheaper than the shares, limited risks, potential massive gain.

Writing options (also confusingly reffered to as selling options a lot of the time), is a minefield of potential massive loss if it goes wrong that could end up losing you far more money than you put in. I doubt you get an account to do this easily but though I'd leave the extra warning so you do you own research on these things properly before diving in.

Read https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp and more."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying and selling options is way way more profitable (and riskier) than buying stocks.

He paid $69 for the option, which then shot up to $8270 in worth.

They have their own supply and demand, it was worth that much because people were willing to pay that much, likely with the expectation it‚Äôs become even more valuable as the stock went up even further.


Options are the only way you can turn $100 into $1000 overnight.  It‚Äôs also the only way you can easily do the reverse.

WSB has historically dealt *only* with options, it‚Äôs even in the sidebar."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The option has to be worth the profit it can provide the owner of the underlying stock. Exercising it usually a redundant step
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You wouldn‚Äôt be buying at 177, you are selling at 177, you are buying at 82.70. You can‚Äôt sell those shares at 177 if you didn‚Äôt buy them first at 82.70, which means you need the money for 300 shares x 82.70 and then sell them at 177. You are technically not turning $200 into 24k because you have to use your own money to buy 300 shares at 82.70 first. Obviously I am missing something here, so I am not telling you how it is, I am just expressing myself in hopes of being corrected."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright. So the 82.70 is the price of the option right now. So to buy that option now you would have to pay 82.70 x 100. So it costs 8270 per contract. The 82.70 is not the price you pay for the stock but the premium per stock in the option.

Since the price paid is 0.69 and the break even point is 100.69, this means the strike price of this option is 100. If they were to exercise now, they would pay 100 x 100 x 3 = 30,000 and immediately sell for 177.01 x 100 x 3 = 53.103. The profit here being 53k -30k -price of the call option. This comes out to a profit per share of roughly 77 (177-100). However, they can also just sell the option. Here you see that the value is currently 82.70. it is higher than 77 (which is what they would earn through exercising) because increased volatility for example increases the price of a call option.

So here it would be better to sell the option, which he can do for 82.70 x 100 x 3 = 24,810. By selling the option they do not have to buy the underlying. They bought the contracts for 207 and can sell the contracts for 24,810. This is an 11,000% return on the initial investment.

Does this make sense?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you exercise the option you buy at ~100 and sell at ~177 (~77 profit per share), and if you sell the option you buy at 0.69 cents per share and are now able to sell it at ~82 per share?
Edit: The price to buy the option (at market value 177) is now $82?? Is that where the whole Greeks come in?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The price of an option includes many more factors than just option premium, strike price, and stock price.

The black scholes model for example additionally uses risk free rate, time to maturity, and a normal distribution function to calculate the price of a non dividend paying underlying stock.

The greeks are the first and second order taylor expansions of the black scholes formula where for example delta measures the change in option value with respect to a change in the underlying asset price.

Greeks are used to hedge against risk and to see how profit/loss is affected as risk factors change (sich as a change in the underlying).

Regarding what you wrote, yes you are correct. The reason that the option price is now 82.70 instead of for example 77, is most likely because of the volatility of the underlying stock. GME is super volatile sometimes and in those phases the option premiums reflect this volatility by becoming very high.

Just with general risk return, the higher the risk the higher the return needed, so people writing the call see a super risky underlying and demand higher premiums (because of wrong they lose a lot but if right they want to win a lot).

Does this make sense?

Edit: black scholes is for price european options not american options.

Edit 2: sorry, black scholes can price both types of options but the one I wrote about is the european one. In the american option greeks are used. Specifically the partial derivative with respect to time and the underlying."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean kinda... But he also has intrinsic value in the contract now. 77 dollars worth (177 current price -100 strike =77.) So 77 of the 82 dollars is intrinsic value of the option. The rest is time value(extrinsic value) and the Greeks affecting option price. So 5 dollars is extrinsic value and 77 dollars is intrinsic value. Because without iv, the Greeks and time value the option would be worth 77 per share(0 day to expiry). Greeks are derivatives of the stock price, price movement as well as probabilities. 



This is a good explanation of how the Greeks translate to options price

https://www.investopedia.com/trading/using-the-greeks-to-understand-options/"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes it makes sense. I was just first confused what the $82 represented (thought it was the stock price during the time he bought the option at .69 cents) and then so baffled by how high the option price went (from 69 cents to $82). I am going to read a book on it to make sure I understand it 100%. Thanks for the help

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"$1000 a share makes them the largest automaker in the world, with a product lineup of 4 vehicles, of each only 2 are actively produced. Oh, and they only have 10 years of rolling stock requiring maintenance and repair work, while companies like Mercedes have vehicles 50 years old still rolling around town, requiring regular maintenance.  

Oh, and they offer no other services, while companies like Volvo have all electric trucks already in corporate fleets, FIAT have defense contracts with the UK and Italy, Honda make motorbikes and engines for boats, Hyundia are also the world's largest shipbuilder. 

Even if Tesla became a dominant force in automotive industry, it's still not going to be worth what it is currently valued at. Even if it's focus is batteries, Panasonic also makes batteries, have been doing it much longer than TSLA and already have supply contracts with major automotive manufacturers.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm really really excited to see the 25K model, if it's good and not some alien squid monster with unexpected compromises, I think I may very well get it. That would then be gunning directly for the common commuter cars of the world, and with gas and maintenance savings, 25K would be getting to the point where a lot of people may as well go to it rather than a Civic/Corolla etc. If you have incentives, EZ. 

Hope to see and maybe reserve it soon."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont think i would own one. 

The fact there is touchscreens for everything makes me reconsider it from a safety perspective."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll buy one when they get rid of the stupid ipad on the dash.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thing is, they cant. For now. Not enough material for such a demand theyd get if they were to sell it at this price.  Not enough production power and not sure the grid could support such a fast raise in electric vehicles.  

But id also own one if it was cheaper that the price it is now."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Me tooüò¢
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They announced a 25k tesla in India. Bookings have opened I think. It's coming soon
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally.   My arkk leaps have been destroyed
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,she is no doubt playing Back in the Saddle driving into the office this morning.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,got me a Jan 2023 $1700c üòé
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm on the rocket with youüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄto the moon!!!!!!!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Cant wait to see the view from up there!!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,it's already flying. I think it will open at 725 or higher this morning.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You will wake up to good tendies sir. Premarket 705 right now.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck me, I sold 2 of these  
  
Edit: no I actually sold 725c ü§°ü§°"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be awesome if shares make it to $5k
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So a 5 trillion market cap? That's just not happening ever.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The market must the FF13 battle system.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How reliable is the article stating the increased price target? Lol you can go directly to their site and see it. I just liked a 3rd party source that summarizes it easily and let me post to reddit
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The premiums must be insanely high for tsla calls no?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Already did
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Forsure
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Let this baby ride. This news will push tsla up all week
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Drop gamestop. Ride tesla
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Think about it
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,UNDER ONE BANNER
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause thats how it always goes! There's never a huge premarket pop followed by a dip about an hour after opening.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,already +40 in pre-market
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,√âlon
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,its not over 9000 yet?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Call me when it reaches 2k and stays there for 2 quarters straight.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,bruh... NEVER sell TSLA shares <-- best advice you could get for the upcoming decade
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How is $1000 priced in on a stock trading at $660? You're too smooth brained
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Watch this bitch run to $800 this week
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,ban this guy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt let your chipotle manager see you on your phone during work.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What does that mean. I‚Äôm new this
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What does the ‚ÄúC‚Äù mean at the end? Why is May 7th significant?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Priced in
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one tell this guy about the subsidies for the gas industry.

And the tax credit for buyers is probably coming back.  That goes to buyers, not Tesla.  The main subsidies Tesla gets is in credits from other automakers that can't get their shit together and make an EV (i.e. carbon credits)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">Tesla seems like a total bubble. Government subsidies are the only thing keeping the operation profitable. Musk fanboys just like pushing the price up.

!RemindMe 4 years"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Oh, and they offer no other services

Okay Mr. Crackhead, back in your box"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">Even if Tesla became a dominant force in automotive industry, it's still not going to be worth what it is currently valued at.

Currently valued around ~$650B cap

!RemindMe 4 years"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sane, realistic comment on WSB? Susssssssssss"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are talking to people who believe GME will go up to 100k per share and they can sell their position to buy a country.

But I agree with you, Tesla‚Äôs current valuation is based on the assumption they will outcompete every other automobile manufacturer while also be completely vertically integrated. And they come out with dozens of other innovative services. All that is already priced in."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you‚Äôre neglecting to see the other side of Tesla‚Äôs products. 

Batteries, insurance, solar, chargers, and many more coming."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats okay. You can miss the gain train
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">At some point the hype will die down and they'll begin to be priced like any other car company, because they are, in fact, just a car company.

!RemindMe 4 years"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">because they are, in fact, just a car company. 

Amazed that so many are unaware Tesla has other services available."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not even trying to meme on you but this sounds really boomer and you're gonna miss out on easy gains my friend
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,!RemindMe 2 years
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This sub has really changed. Never thought I'd see it turn on Papa Musk like this.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Tsla is buy the rumor and buy the news
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"the GME story is done.. yes the stock could keep going crazy, but TSLA is guaranteed to go up like a motherfucker from here (long term)

I took my $60k profits from GME and put it in TSLA like a responsible investor that wants to be rich"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"stop buying the cheap chinese knock off, buy the great American brand!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No u
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure if you hate money
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Click the link bud
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,But Sega Saturns were awesome
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My mom's 1993 saturn ran almost perfectly for 20 years. 300k+ miles
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, I had 300k on a 2005 Saturn Ion and it was an awesome car. Only reason it got replaced last year was because the body control module was shot and spare parts are insane to get. But like, obviously that's the case for a 15 year old car from a company that no longer exists."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exsqueeze me? My daily driver is a stick 2.2 Eco motor Saturn Ion .. Motor still does not drip anything.  Gonna be buried in it when I die. No rust, she is plastic."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,üòÇ I didn‚Äôt think anyone here remembered saturns. Or Oldsmobile
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Weren't they basically rebadged Opels? Opels are pretty solid.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"given how many I see on the roads still, they're not too terrible. slow, but the engines could take a beating.

Unless you got the ones with the fucked piston rings due to internal GM sabotage of their own brand."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Papa Elon is back! And we LOVED it!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here, take my award.  That‚Äôs a good one!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,We likey
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It ran up to $2k.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone also said it will sink to $400 level in the past so that‚Äôs that
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,10-8 round
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup it's about to get very competitive and that'll push margins down. I think we'll see some decent, affordable offerings in about 2-3 years."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the smartphone revolution all over again, except this time smartphones will be cheaper than flip phones.

Going to be a bloodbath and a mad rush to get away from gas engines within 5 years. Same thing happened in Norway thanks to gov incentives, and they are the absolute worst country to own an ev in (very cold and most live in apartments)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet $1000 this will never happen
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, people don't realize how much cheaper it is to own an EV than an ICE car beyond that initial price tag.  Literally no maintenance, way more reliable and fractional costs for electricity vs gas.  

I would go as far to say that a 35k EV is ultimately cheaper than a 25k ICE car.

That doesn't even factor in the fact that driving a Tesla is like driving around from the future."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Once the batteries scale up with the new tech they can get costs cheap enough. The question is more why use up supply if they can sell ever other car they make at a higher price point. The limiting factor I think is overall production.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I will be buying one as soon as the price is 25k or lower. Such a nice innovative product.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol it is the safest car ever made with the best user interface ever put in a car and any bullshit you hear otherwise is just blatent FUD. Try it. Seriously. Go try one. Even if you can't afford to buy it. You'll see.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what everyone worries about until they try it.  Took me maybe a week, tops, to get used to it and now when I get in an ICE vehicle I gag at all of the dumb, useless buttons and dials everywhere."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own one and it isnt a huge deal, but I also just throw it into AP if I have to type on the damn thing to put in an address. Voice commands work too. the steering wheel buttons work well, most of the driver centric stuff is on the driver side anyway."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My leaps are a day old so off to a good start üëçüèΩ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I had an order placed for a 670c but i dont think itll fill at this point lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,lol

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,nah they will be in tendie town at least that‚Äôs what I think .Tesla is a great stock.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,you‚Äôve reached new levels of autism beyond this sub
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell low, buy high. You're in the right place."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Alexa play Roll Out by Ludacris
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They are close if you go by pre-split numbers. Elon will probably do another 5:1 split this year to keep shares affordable to retail
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,give it 2 years...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 3 years
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember when everyone who thought Apple would become a $1T company back in 2012 when it was like $200B... they were shit on so bad. Even the smartest guys said $1T was impossible.

Apple is now $2T on pace to probably be $3T anytime within 6-12 months."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,3000 per share sounds reasonable
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Anything is possible bet lots of people said APPL wouldn‚Äôt ever have a market cap of over 2T?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,3T is very possible in 5 years
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,!RemindMe 5 years
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably means $5000 pre split
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ever is a really long time! After the first company hit 1 trillion, others were soon after it, and then 2 trillion was hit in comparatively no time. 

For Tesla specifically, the wildcard is if FSD is truly around the corner this time (old Elon has been saying this since 2015 where it was two years away, so I would not be surprised at more time padding) and they have a many year headstart on a general solution that doesn't need HD mapping. If car margins shift to robotaxi margins, all bets are off."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a Tesla bull increasing the price target, is this news?

Here he is saying how great it is in December: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27GdUD4Iz7U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27GdUD4Iz7U)"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ban
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ban
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"He/She is making a bet that Tesla stock will be at 1250 share price by the 7th of may. It's an option. So:
  
a) they could be write and sell the contract for $
  
b) they could be write and buy Tesla shares for $1250 assuming Tesla is over $1250 by 5/7
  
c) they could be wrong and lose whatever they put into the option, I didn't look at their call online but for $1250, only a few weeks away, they probably spent close to a grand or more. A lot more if they bought multiple 'tracts."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It means take your cock and arrange it so it‚Äôs touching your asshole and then bounce on it
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not May 7th, it's the old ""5/7"" meme"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I was talking about the credit subsidies from other automakers which are the only thing keeping Tesla profitable. Generally don‚Äôt trust stock dependent on the government to make money and also think Tesla is not that far ahead of other automakers.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you going to dispute what he said, or just ""roast"" him with an automated reddit timer because you can't set your own calendar alert?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,All of the energy stuff represents less than 2% of their revenue. Insurance even less than that and it‚Äôs a joke.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh it can go to 800 before it crashes, huge gains i guess.."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They're the same person who didn't buy Amazon in 2013 because they were just an online retailer.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Guardian heroes still underrated
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me tell you as a former owner of a 1989 Oldsmobile Delta 88 RB.... Them cars are slow (top speed said 85) and ugly as hell but my god are they a comfortable ride.  Smooth and with that bench seat it was like I was driving to work on my sofa... Seriously who ever said let's get rid of bench seats clearly never had a girlfriend.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,My first car was a cutlass Ciera
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"pre-2002 Saturn S series, no.

Post 2001 L series and ion, yes.

Saturn engineers also fixed notorious (and intentional problems) with the engines gm made them use, and were preferred sources of engines for other models that used those engines because of that."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"In that case, I‚Äôm in!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Son of a bitch, I'm in!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well cheers. I collect shares, not awards, but cheers anyway!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah after another 5:1 split once the stock reaches $2000.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh it will, but not now."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If tesla can do it we could see one in America for sub 30k in less than 2
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I am betting with sandy Munro that the Chinese companies come in with cheap quality electric cars like the Japanese did with ICE years ago. Stock is still cheap with that in mind.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôll lose
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Better bet it on tesla.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,100 years ago people were using horses and you think given infinite time there will never be electric cars? Are you literally special needs?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk man Beamer has that dial which is pretty nice, the big iPad is way more distracting, and I have and love both."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see where he is coming from though. Button's in a car are IMO just way safer to use, especially when you're driving on a highway. I'm a tech geek and like the touchscreen in teslas, but in my opinion they over use it a bit, especially when the newest ones really are gonna have gear selection trough the touchscreen, it feels like a dumb move to me (especially because it's illegal in my country to use their screen while driving/engine is on lol). But as long as they keep it on the steering wheel as well its gonna be fine i guess"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sometime people just prefer buttons my dude
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,But I can‚Äôt hang a hammock in a Tesla yet !
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the safety claims are well founded, I think its just an alien thought to not have controls and a mindset change. 

UK pricing for a model 3 is about ¬£45,000 so its not as affordable."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not really the safety-ness *of the car*, but like, having to look at the screen in order to turn on windshield wipers kind of sucks ass."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you! i'll be laughing at this
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well yeah because they got massive tax cuts from trump. America can't afford more tax cuts for the rich. Tesla is massively overvalued already, they will never be a $5T company."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Apple is actually making a lot of money. Elon musk is just promising things and producing a few cars.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It is not. Institutional investors would have to bet all they have on tesla. They won't because they know it's a hype.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You kinda seem like a gay üêª
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy puts then. Do it
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah what this tool said.

Wait a sec"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So what if he's wrong but the stock still goes up? Does he still make a little but of money? Or died the stock HAVE to hit the exact price target for it to be profitable at all?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone is mad that they can't comprehend that a debt laden company with 100+ future stranded asset factories is worth less than the only Western company dedicated to making the dominant form of terrestrial transportation in 20 years. Even ignoring all the very valuable Tesla side businesses and lead in autonomy.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did it so Reddit would remind me. 

Why dispute it? It‚Äôs FUD"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bench seats are the goat
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"true that! first car i drove when i got my license at 16, and a bunch of speeding tickets even with top speed of 85, lol"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla said the would start production of their $25K car in 2022. But, I think they will start producing it in their Shanghai factory."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if tesla manages to reduce it's price to as low as a toyota sedan it's market is still limited to developed countries. 

M√≤st countries and potential markets like China,Russia,Indonesia, India, Nigeria lack the infrastructure to create the network of charging stations.  

Long commutes can be impossible in some cases.

While USA and EU are switching to EVs,China is heavily investing in gas cars, their car manufacturing is booming. 

The west is basically shooting itself in the foot. 

What car companies should've done instead is reduce the price of gas cars as much as possible.

This is just my opinion."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla is a bubble
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but that's normal wear and tear.  But ICE cars are way worse since the traction control is so bad compared to what you get in an EV.  I can't spin tire if I try in my Model 3 Performance."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You want safe just use voice control. They do need to improve that part though
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sometimes people prefer horses too.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"People said that about smartphones when Apple began overtaking blackberry.

Tesla's UI and usability is fantastic on my model 3."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,retarded comment just as the one you wrote earlier.  PUTS on Tesla were a gold mine a week ago.  This shit will trade sideways for a while.  If at all you sell an ITM put.  Figure out how to wrinkle your smooth brain.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"More or less yes. 
  
If it hits 1250 that's good. But there's also the cost of what he paid for the contracts themselves. 
  
So factoring that in, he's gonna need a share price a little over 1250 to profit. 
  
This is ""call"" option buying by the way. When you bet a stock is gonna go down you buy a ""put""."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure call me a dipshit but just completely ignore the fact that China literally sold:
  
*Takes breath*
  
23 million units in 2020. Which is 16% DOWN FROM 2017. 
  
*Sticks dick in your ass*
  
Which isn't even to say anything of the fact that the *fucking market share of BEV AND PHEV in CHINA is a measley fucking 4.9%*.
  
*Pulls dick out of your ass, considers using lube, nah sticks in back in, aggressively*
  
Now my dear little prone EV bull you are not wrong my dear. Your ass may be gaped to the size of a watermelon but you're arguments do bear some weight. Let's take a look at what China *plans* to do:
  
*Starts fish hooking your üêÇ cheek as you're penetrated once again. The mascara is rolling down your cheeks at this point. You're crying from the pain but you love it*. 
  
By FUCKING 2025:
  
CHINA will have a grand total of *checks notes*:
  
~7.8 million evs sold! Wow what a bull number let's see what they're up to in the present! In 2020:
  
Monthly sales volume of current BEVs must be staggeringly high right? 
  
167k units sold.....
  
K?
  
Quick what's china's population? ü§îü§îü§î
  
Oh wait they're still in the billions aren't they? Not good for bulls. 
  
*about to climax in your asshole*
  
So China, which has such a good great golly gosh darn ev market. Only sells 4.9% of their total customer base evs. Only has sold to .02% of their population. And only has less than a million charging stations country-wide. 
  
So you have 4.9% of the market share. Probably localized to cities, owning 0.2% of total theoretical sales. Meanwhile there's only enough charging points for 0.05% of the population who would even want these cars to begin with. They've only sold 1.3 million units this year. And that number isn't going up drastically UNTIL 2025. 
  
Like fuck off with your bull fuckery. 
  
China may have a great market for EVs.  But it's not until 3 years from now AT THE EARLIEST.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, true. it would be a problem if you're on a state highway between cities.

Personally, I find the risk of diverting attention for a few seconds to enable wipers while autopilot is enabled to be acceptable; just look ahead a 1/4 mile, make sure nothing funny's going on, then.. two button taps (wiper icon -> speed, or push the physical wiper button and then pick speed).

now.. if I can just get some replacement wipers for the driver side, that'd be great. they're sold out on their online store :("

2021-04-05 08:00:08,wallstreetbets,"Institutional Investors Recently Buying GME and Not Exiting Full Position I wanted to take a deeper look into GME and what the hedge funds have been doing recently with the stock. I know a lot of you have your doubts about Fintel but I have a membership account and I don't believe all the data should be dismissed.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that a lot of hedge funds have not fully exited their position in GameStop. If we take a look at Institutional Ownership, there have been no fully executed exited positions with Hedge Funds recently. Are other institutional investors starting to believe that the shorts are in trouble? I believe so, here's some data to back that claim up.

Edit: I had to remove the screenshots from Fintel ,but I can tell by the average share of the price that the positions taken have been done recently.

If you take a look at GME stock during the dates of 25MAR2021 - 27MAR2021 and then compare that to the buys from Fintel, you can see there is a correlation. I believe that the hedge funds were coordinating an effort to surge the stock price and then drop it to deflate positivity about this stock. Unfortunately for them it did not work and GME quickly gained resistance at around the price of around 180. This leads me to believe that the available shares that they can purchase to influence the stock price is no longer significant enough to drop the price as drastically as before. 

Edit \^ OR they do have enough shares to drop the price even lower but they figured out that the apes would just buy the dip. We all know that they all hedge on their shorts so they don't get margin called or are too imbalanced and prone to a huge loss in either direction. In my my opinion they will run out of capitol eventually when that is who knows? That is why I always encourage to buy shares not options. When one buys losing options you are only benefiting the market maker. In this case it would be Citadel's Market Maker Division. Where do you think those earnings go to? That's why I only buy shares with CASH NEVER on Margin.

Also a tip, use the indicator ""Accumulation/Distribution Indicator for analyzing Charts (Indicator available in Yahoo Finance)  Anything above a +5 is usually an indicator that a stock price is going up due to buying from institutional investors. Unfortunately for now they are the only ones that have the available capital to be able to buy a stock to affect it's price that dramatically. Anything under an Accumulation/Distribution Indicator of 0 leads me to believe that the price is going up due to retail investors buying the stock.

This is not financial advice, I just believe dearly in this stock and what it might be able to do for others in the future =)

May God Bless All of You

2021-04-05 06:50:16,wallstreetbets,"Corsair Gaming - CRSR - Small Cap, Big Gains **Company Background:** Corsair Gaming provides gear for gamers and content creators. Their products range from keyboards to high-end gaming PCs.

**Opportunity:** Sold off hard in March giving you an entry opportunity.

**Revenue Growth:**

|Year|Revenue (Billions)|Year Over Year Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|0.9||
|2019|1.1|17|
|2020|1.7|55|
|2021|1.8 - 1.95 (CRSR Guidance)|6 - 15|

2020 was a huge year for Corsair and their revenue growth can largely be attributed to the Covid lockdowns. However, even after growing revenue 55% YoY they expect to post strong numbers again in 2021. Personally, I expect them to be in the 1.9 to 2 billion revenue range. Online gaming is huge and continues to grow. Streaming is also a growing market that Corsair competes in. 71% of millennial gamers in the U.S. watch gaming content on streaming platforms.

The gaming industry was valued at 162 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach 296 billion by 2026.

**Valuation:**

||Corsair Gaming|Logitech|S&P 500 Information Technology Sector\*\*\*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Forward P/E|19|25|29|
|Price Sales|1.83|4.17|6.23|
|Market Cap|3.1 Billion|18.2 Billion||
|Revenue|1.7 Billion (Double-digit growth)|3 Billion (Single-digit growth)||

Corsair and Logitech have significant overlap in product categories. However, Corsair has premium pricing compared to Logitech. Corsair has a strong brand name in the gaming community allowing them to leverage premium pricing.

\*\*\*Not an apples-to-apples comparison. I included it to give you an idea of the sector metrics as a whole.

**Channel Relationships:**

|Americas|APAC|EMEA|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Micro Center,.....|Amazon, JD, SYNNEX,.....|Amazon, Media Markt, Midfactory.de, Exertis,...|

Corsair has strong channel relationships and I expect them to grow as the gaming market expands. More importantly, they already have a global distribution network established.

**""AnAlYsT aNd ExpErtS"":** Price targets from $37 to $55 giving you an upside of 9% to 62%. I don't look at price targets but I included them for those that do.

**My Play:** 400 shares (looking at houses so I didn't have much to throw at it). I don't see the gaming industry or high-end PC industry slowing down anytime soon. I see long-term growth which is why I went for shares. I've sold and closed some CC's so my cost basis is in the Mid 34s.

2021-04-05 06:23:34,wallstreetbets,"The Uranium Bull Thesis Is Playing Out To Perfection. A $500bn Market Is Emerging. A Multi-Year Run For The Equities Is Inevitable! With so many exciting developments of late, I wanted to share my .02 on the current state of the uranium market, focusing a bit on SWU, which I am very fond of haha. As always, I look forward to any feedback.  

As am sure all are aware, we have seen a 15% jump in spot over last 2 weeks. While the increase was in large part to non-producing mines physical purchasing , I noticed a number of discussions on Reddit and various Discord servers, StockTwits also, seeming to suggest that this uptick in spot U was indicative of where we are in the current fuel cycle.

Experienced investors in this sector will tell you however that this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.

Rather, a more powerful indicator as to where we are in the cycle is by looking at the SWU enrichment price.

Based in large part on SWU projections, many expert investors are forecasting a $500bn market. For perspective, during the last cycle, the market peaked at \~$150bn.

***So... what is SWU?***

For those very new to uranium investing, a very quick overview might be helpful. Also, for those more familiar than I am, I appreciate the feedback.

SWU (short for Separative Work Unit) is a measure for the cost of enrichment. Generally speaking, when SWU prices are low, utilities benefit by purchasing excess enrichment inventory at cheap prices using intermediaries (i.e., carry trades).

Conversely, a rise in SWU signifies that the demand for enrichment is growing. As excess inventories are utilized by end users, the utilities (no longer aided by the secondary market) instead turn to the uranium producers to purchase future contracts at much higher prices. It follows logically that higher enrichment prices force the utilities to retreat back into the fuel cycle; from conversion (UF6) and even fabricated fuel purchasing, to the beginning (i.e. spot U308), which in turn drives those spot prices up.

Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, higher SWU prices on future contracts are essential in incentivizing the mines to come back online. McArthur and Cigar Lake, for example, need at least the $40's, and for Paladin, likely in the $50s in order to justify their operational costs.

Therefore, **SWU is arguably the best indicator of where we are in the fuel cycle**.

Even when there are false starts/spikes in the market (which we‚Äôve seen in the past couple years), SWU price is consistent.

***What is the current SWU price?***

SWU bottomed out at $\~34 in August 2018 after so much excess accumulated in the years following Fukushima.

Since hitting that low, SWU has been on a relative straight line upwards, currently estimated at \~$54. This steady growth over the past 2.5 years is one of, if not the most, compelling reason investors are so confident of a long bull market to come in this sector.

***So... how the \*\*\*\* is SWU forecasting a $500bn market?!***

Of course, there are a number of things we can look at that are driving this thing. It's becoming almost a daily occurrence now to see catalysts emerging (i.e., breaking news this week on EU Green energy qualifications, the White House endorsing nuclear in as part of the clean energy standard).

However, more-so than anything SWU is at the core of the bull thesis, which is, that ***decarbonization of the electrical grid around the world is not possible without nuclear power*** (Duke Energy Corp. just said the same yesterday...)

As SWU prices continue to rise, **it is inevitable that equity prices will follow**. Denison is a fun example. 

Even now , I'm still amazed at how many people claiming to have thousands of shares of certain uranium producers are surprised when they hear that Denison isn't actually producing any uranium. When utilities start executing term contracts with other producers at SWU in the $60s, $70s, $80s, and beyond, those mines will turn the lights back on. The fact that they just bought spot above market is a pretty powerful indication of where things are headed as far as volume on these long term contracts. It won't be long before Denison‚Äôs prices start to rise. The same idea goes with Cominak, Ranger, etc.

Moreover, what happens when we've exhausted Cigar Lake and Kazatomprom? Or McArthur River? 

It isn't just that we have a rising demand, we need new projects coming into existence now in order to avoid a huge deficit in supply between 2025-2030. The investment opportunities on these projects are extremely exciting. 

***And why $500bn***? 

Frankly, I think $500bn is conservative, though something in this vicinity I have seen as the consensus among many experts. Market cap for publicly traded uranium is at 125bn right now, and this is only the very beginning. Ultimately, there are new players in the game with a ton of liquidity (i.e., hedge funds), and they are looking for value. Taking $URNM as one example, the AUM just months ago when it IPO'd was a few million. Now AUM is $175mm. We also cannot ignore what is happening in China. It is a huge growth story there. There is also a SPEC frenzy.  

But again, looking at the big picture, more-so than anything else, I keep going back to SWU. For me, it is the most powerful predictor of the multi-year bull run to come. And while there will always be doubtful retail who, to their credit, have rightfully called false starts over the last couple years, you cannot deny what 2.5 years of rising SWU enrichment prices means for where we are in the current cycle.

Again, I would be very interested to hear where folks agree/disagree. Any and all feedback is appreciated!"

Same thing if Urenco builds just one more enrichment facility.  What happens then?

Also, if SWU gets too expensive, why wouldn't we just substitute with more uranium mining?  This seems like a kinda self-limiting commodity.

There are a very limited number of reactor vendors and firms that can build nuclear plants.  If your bull thesis has new nuclear construction why wouldn't you just invest in one of those companies?  In fact, why not AREVA?  They're a reactor vendor who owns enrichment facilities.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am skeptical of uranium market going up so quickly. While I do think that nuclear energy is the way to go if we want to meet our climate goals, folks need to realize that nuclear plants take a long time to construct (quicker in some countries and longer in others) and become operational.    They need to be licensed and operational to consume fuel. The amount of fuel a reactor consumes is pretty constant, so you either need alot more new reactors being built to increase demand or price of uranium fuel needs to go up. Uranium is abundant naturally so mining isn't an issue. 

[Also, more reactors were permanently shut down last year than are currently under construction.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/513671/number-of-under-construction-nuclear-reactors-worldwide/) 

Personally, I will go bullish on uranium once there is net positive increase in nuclear reactors (more constructed per year vs shutdown) and sadly this isn't currently the case."

Its a much easier supply and demand question.

We produced only 68% of uranium used last year, most of the mines are still shut down ( Cameco, the second largest producer, is basically not producing for over half a year now) even before this, only a few miners were breaking even just producing additional pounds, at this price, unless someone finds a new super deposit and or a totally new cheaper way of mining Uranium, we'll literally have no more mines in under a decade as there's no mine that can reasonably be built or restarted at these prices.

So as a well known mining investor says, if you don't think Uranium will go up, you're saying that most existing reactors will close in five years and all on going construction of new plants will be abandoned."

Electricity has to come from somewhere at a price buyers can afford. Fossil is better than nothing. In terms of pollution, nat gas is better than coal and has some advantages over solar (land usage and manufacturing byproducts). Dispatchability is also crucial.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never say never, but I don't think we'll be seeing much-- if any-- new nuclear construction started up this decade.  It's not even just that natural gas is so much cheaper, it's also that nuclear is not a dispatchable power source, plus it's very difficult for a utility to finance the construction of a nuclear power plant simply because the capital outlay for a plant is so large relative to your typical utility's market cap.

I think coal is on it's way out, (at least in the U.S, in China it's a different story), and I think it's mostly natural gas that will be replacing it.

I think hydro is a slam-dunk winner anywhere you've got the resource.  I think onshore wind has gotten to that point where it's a threat to natural gas on a cost-basis if the resource is good enough, and solar in a place with good insolation isn't far behind either.   But the lack of dispatchability of these sources will become a major issue, and I don't think there's an energy storage solution on the horizon that is quite good enough to put that problem aside.

I think the big winner is natural gas.  There's still so much of it in the ground that we can reach with fracking now, I think it will be quite a while before natural gas prices rise enough to start curtailing it as a power source.  It's cheap and dispatchable, and until a price gets put on carbon there's basically nothing stopping it from just wiping the floor with everyone else.  And even then, the dispatchability of it will still carve it out a place in the pie.

I think the non-hydro dispatchable renewable sources, geothermal and solar thermal aren't quite there yet.  But I think geothermal is a real sleeper-- the fact that all the technologies and techniques developed for drilling and fracking for oil/natural gas can be turned right around and applied to geothermal is a big deal.

I'm biased though obviously, when I came back to the US for my 4th degree I wrote my second thesis on enhanced geothermal systems.  But hey, if you cant beat the frackers, join em, right?"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It was a joke dude. I was giving him a compliment
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you mind if I ever sent you questions that I have about the viability of MSRs? and other thorium based reactors ?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a pleb who's barely written one thesis, but you've left out the possibility of existing power plants getting extensions on their lifetimes within the US, which I believe the Biden administration is looking into."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Are there any serious attempts to use fracking techniques for geothermal? I don‚Äôt know much about either but I think I‚Äôm about to dive in...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"4 degrees man. I‚Äôm contemplating my first, lol."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are a fuck ton of nuclear reactors coming online in China and India. Some in Eastern Europe too. 


What‚Äôs crazy is that solar and wind now match NG power generation. In my province we have very cheap NG and it‚Äôs the case even hear. 


Geothermal doesn‚Äôt work great in many many places. The energy generated is small too. 


Hydro is great but super expensive. Wind and solar are the best bets here."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand why you are fixated on whether new nuclear plants are created, or how it compares to nat gas, or other renewables. Its not relevant to what I posted, and has nothing to do with why uranium equities are performing so well.

The thesis itself is a very simple supply/demand story. The utilities still need enriched uranium (20% of US electric comes from nuclear, \~15% globally). After COVID shut down the main producing mines (Cameco, Kazak), inventories have been steadily declining.

In addition to that, a number of producing (and non-producing) companies have started buying above spot 308 prices to fulfill their long term contract obligations with the utilities. Thus inventories are even more squeezed. The producing mines - irrespective of COVID - won't come back online unless the uranium price justifies their operational expenses.

The majority of long terms contracts are coming off the books this year and next, forcing utilities to re-negotiate at **much** higher prices. This will continue to drive spot prices up, and the equities will follow.

Again, I don't understand your fixation with comparing natural gas to nuclear. I'm trying to make money here, and the uranium market is booming.

If there is a strong case to buy up natural gas stocks I would be interested to hear the thesis."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you actually? Okay I‚Äôll take this offline. Not gonna say any more then. I thought you weren‚Äôt him. Saying bad practices abroad forced you to quit ESG. Article in The Tech and a few other places.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"My guy. Speak to me in layman‚Äôs terms...I‚Äôm proud of you for not being smooth brained, but this is incomprehensible"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">next generation reactors, Thorium is.

Why stop there? 

Calls on Tritium and Deuterium for 2050."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is advocating nat gas. So yes, fossils. What am I missing here?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, though I can probably give a short rundown right now:

Fuel is a very small component of the levelized cost of nuclear power-- raw uranium counts for maybe 5%, enrichment and manufacturing of it into fuel rods is another 5%.  80% of the LCOE is capital costs.

Uranium is one of the most plentiful elements on earth, and we have decades of it at the current price point, and probably centuries at double the current price point, so the fuel cost component of nuclear is unlikely to go up significantly any time soon.

Any technology that promises to lower the fuel costs of nuclear has lost the plot.  Capital costs are the problem-- unless the technology being proposed is offering lower capital costs per kWh, I am not interested in it.

Similarly, I think most new nuclear ideas that promise to lower the volume of nuclear waste produced per kWh are missing the plot.  Not only is nuclear waste cheap and safe to store, but it's not volume that matters, it's the quantity of long-lived radionuclides.  Unless somewhere in the process we are reducing the number of these daughter atoms, then it doesn't matter how much volume the nuclear waste takes up-- so splitting 10% of the atoms in five fuel rods vs splitting half the atoms in one fuel rod doesn't matter, you still get the same number of split atoms.

Molten salt reactors are cool, I always love geeking out over new reactor designs.  BUT, as lame as it sounds, the safety and economics of an incremental, evolutionary approach are almost always going to be superior to a radically different design.  We have a lot of experience designing, building, and operating light water reactors.  From that experience we have developed a thorough understanding of what materials survive the longest, what components will need to be replaced when, and how to operate the reactors safely and with minimal downtime.  By switching to a new design, in particular one that uses a completely different coolant and moderator, we are sacrificing a lot of our expensively-obtained knowledge.

I'm not a materials science guy.  In my undergraduate thesis I used a research project that was testing alloys for a molten-lead fast reactor, but I was looking at it from a sort of meta perspective. 
 I took a class called Materials in Nuclear Engineering in grad school but I probably understood less than half of it.  So I could be wrong, but the first thing that comes to mind when I hear about MSR's is ""What's the corrosion like?""  And unless the answer I get back is ""We have completely figured it out,"" then I'm probably gonna pass."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They're a really cool concept. Not a magic panacea though. There's a pretty good summary written by a nuclear engineer [here](https://whatisnuclear.com/msr.html).
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Duane Arnold is shutting down early. Nuclear just can't get past the fact that it's twice the price of gas/wind/solar. You might see more gov't bailouts like in Ohio and NY to keep the plants running as a stopgap measure but I just don't see any future.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the market already expects this though, if for no other reason than it's just such a sensible thing to do."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes.  The proposition of so-called ""enhanced"" geothermal systems is that you can drill literally anywhere-- you don't need to be near a good heat source-- so long as you drill deep enough and then do some hydraulic fracking to break up the rock and create a lot of surface area for heat exchange, you can set up a geothermal plant anywhere you want.

It's ancient at this point, but it's still a good primer, and that's the [MIT Future of Geothermal report.](https://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/MITEI-The-Future-of-Geothermal-Energy.pdf)

Take some of the conclusions with a grain of salt, 1) because it's 14 and a half years old at this point, and also because 2)  I took a class with him and I think Jeff Tester is a little biased on the subject, but it outlines the basic idea well."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So first things first, if you're still in high school make sure to cheese the system by doing as many AP tests as you can-- you don't have to take the class, just cram the shit out of a test prep book the week before and take the test.  Pick whatever tests your college accepts that you think you've got the best chance at-- worst case scenario you're out a hundred bucks or so, best cast it's the cheapest college credit you'll ever buy.  I rolled in with 13 5's and a 4, so I automatically got about 2 and a half semesters worth of credit, and that gave me a lot of cushion to take risks.

Next, the big secret to college is that no matter how many classes you take, they still charge you the same amount.  So just fucking take them all, rob the bastards blind.  Normally your advisors would stop you, but here's the thing-- if you double major (which in my day was a double degree program), you get two advisors.  So tell advisor A that advisor B signed off on it, and you tell advisor B that advisor A signed off on it, and since mom and dad never talk to each other they'll let you joyride in the lambo.

So I took like 8 classes a semester, had a couple where I took 9/10.  I couldn't do it freshman year (you cant have two advisors your first year so the exploit doesn't work, plus MIT has all sorts of rules on your freshman year because it has a special grading system they don't want you to game), but if you stick to 8 or so classes a semester after that, at that rate you'll be done with all the coursework for four degrees by the end of senior fall.  And once you've banged out that, you're ready to start shopping for sugar daddies.  The U.S. government is the biggest sugar daddy of them all-- if you smile and put on pretty clothes and tell them you'll suck their dick / work in one of their labs, they'll pay for the rest of your college.  You don't *need* to actually go work in a government lab as a career, they're such thirsty fucks they'll start paying for your tuition just for a summer internship and the off chance you decide to stay.

Then you're on easy street.  You've got the next year and a half paid for by Uncle Sam, and the only work left for you to do is your thesis.  So fuck around.  You can meet a lot of cool people and do a lot of cool things in college, and it's sooooo much better when you don't have PSETS and tests to worry about.  I don't know how it is at other colleges, but at MIT there is an absolutely crazy amount of stuff to do outside of classes, you should not miss out on it.

I actually double dipped on fucking around.  I spent a year and a half fucking around, then I applied for the 4th degree, deferred enrollment, took a job overseas, then came back when the economic crisis fucked me over, enrolled in the fourth degree program, and fucked around for another couple years with no work to do except writing a second thesis.

I don't recommend fucking around for 3 and a half years even if Uncle Sam is paying for it all.  That's just too much fucking around to do in your life, even during an economic downturn.  But I got lucky and it worked out for me in the end-- in my third year of being useless I met my girlfriend (she was a freshman, but I added 7 to my age and divided by 2 and she was within range) and now it's ten years later and we've got a nice place and 4 cats and do bougie shit together."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a good point, I'm taking a very U.S.-centric perspective.  I think there's some good nuclear prospects abroad."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"First off, I was responding to a question that was literally:

> Are you of the view that no new nuclear will occur and that wind/solar are on their inevitable upswing within 3-5 years?

So it's really disingenuous of you to claim that I'm ""fixated"" on the question of whether there will be new nuclear when that's *literally* the question I'm being asked.

2)  You still haven't responded to the list of questions I posed to you in my original comment.  Why are you dodging those questions, and instead butting in to other conversations to try and argue?

3)  You still haven't linked me the article you supposedly read that says I'm a human trafficker or I got kicked out of something or whatever the fuck.  I'm kinda starting to think you made it up completely.  How about you put your limited braincells to work on that, okay champ?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I used to write for The Tech.  I find it very hard to believe they would write an article about me without reaching out for comment.  And if I google ""Keith Yost"" and ""The Tech"" all I get is a bunch of pieces I wrote.

Just link whatever article you read, there's no need to take things offline."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nukes expensive. Nukes take forever to build. You only hold stonk for days at a time

This stonk needs decades."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Listen up ape: green glowy power cost too many bananas.

New reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia cost over $30 billion and still aren't finished. The manufacturer (Westinghouse) screwed up costs so bad it went bankrupt. Nuclear industry is fucked in USA without massive government subsidies."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,LCOE... So this is a side of the debate that I haven't been introduced to yet at all. I follow lots of 'pro' nuclear power pages on social media and never heard this discussed. I've always heard that it's more expensive to setup wind and solar than it is to do nuclear but now after reading your post and doing some googling it appears that the LCOE of nuclear is actually increasing. Thank you for your very well thought out and lengthy reply.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Next, the big secret to college is that no matter how many classes you take, they still charge you the same amount.


Not in Canada :("
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. How would I possibly know who YOU are. 

You posted links to essays from MIT on nuclear energy written in 2008 authored by ‚ÄúKeith Yost‚Äù. You then said you have not just 1, but 4 degrees from MIT. 

When folks had a little fun with this, a poster conveniently responded that they knew you from their time as a consultant in Dubai. ‚ÄúYou saved me‚Äù the poster wrote. Pretty crazy coincidence I guess that you guys would find each other on my post of all places? 

Do you not see any of this as bizarre?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright, so buy GME. Say less üöÄüöÄüöÄ

*all jokes aside, Thankyou for your take*"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You told me I had picked a bad person to pretend to be, because the real Keith Yost was someone who had gotten in trouble ""luring"" students abroad.  You said you read an article in The Tech and elsewhere detailing my nefarious deeds.

I need you to really rub those last two brain cells you've got together and *think*.  What article did you read?  Where am I being slandered on the internet?  Or did your dumb ass just make it up?

The only thing bizarre here is you."
2021-04-05 04:34:11,wallstreetbets,"APHA Pre-Earnings Rally. The Easiest Money In All Of Wallstreet; A Free Gift To You From The (Very Stoned) Apes Of R/Weedstocks... https://imgur.com/a/Cksze9a

Take note of the VERY predictable pattern that happens almost *always* the week or two before APHA earnings. They usually rise between 10% to 20% the week or two before. Regardless of what the outcome of earnings, there is a very reliable trading to be had here. 

APHA Earnings are going to be released on April 12th, Tuesday morning prior to market open. I *think* monday of this week will be a down day for Cannabis stocks and will make for an amazing entry into this very high probability trade. 

On top of this incredibly reliable pattern prior to earnings there are additional bullish tail winds that could drive the stock even higher. 

1. Last week Chuck Schumer said that Cannabis legalization legislation (at the federal level) would be coming very soon. He's already delivered on the SAFE Banking Act (which will GREATLY reduce cost of operating a cannabis company and will make it **MUCH** easier for them to raise money and get insurance and banking services.) So I have no reason to doubt that he'll deliver on rescheduling cannabis. 

2. APHA / TLRY merger completing on 4/20 (stoner chuckle, yeah forrr tweentyyy blaze it bro!).

3. TLRY & APHA both jumped substantially after last earnings as both we're very, very solid earnings reports showing the companies gaining market share. 

4. NY Legalized adult use Cannabis, NY of course being one of the largest markets in the US. 

5. APHA bought a Craft Beer company called 'Sweetwater'. On top of the fact that beer is actually good, alcohol consumption in the US is at an all time high. 

So take a look at the charts. Watch the price action tomorrow and if you like the trade idea, buy some calls and sell half or all of them before earnings, or be degenerate gambler and hold them all through earnings."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read through this and your previous posts. Very fascinating. So let me get this right.

1. You sold $SPX box spreads to finance your positions. By box spreading, you're able to achieve sub-1.00% interest rates.
2. You bought a diversified set of ETFs that's beta-neutral which protects you from wild swings (and thus reducing the risk of getting margin called).
3. You're enjoying gains on financed money so far.

I'm having a little bit of trouble figuring out a good credit for box spreads and understanding why TOS is requiring as much as 20% as collateral for my 50 wide box spreads on $SPX. I do not have $400K though. I have two accounts where one is $150K and the other is $120K.

Care to help? Cheers."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is the entire strategy to buy stocks that allow for maximum margin? Am I missing something?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock markets as a whole did not see a downturn since covid, which lasted super short. It seems you started the strategy right after that, so would have gained no matter what. Options are form of leverage as well, so unless we are talking about weeklies, not inherently different. 

The downside protection might be different however. Correct me if I am wrong here, you initially purchased those ETFs with leverage, and things always went up ever since. If however, say they go down 10-30%, how do you deal with rebalancing/selling/putting up more margin. It seems to me that you have not realized any of those gains and do not have excess capital.

So how is this strategy any better than leveraging anything else in the last 10 months? To me, emerging markets are extremely correlated with US markets, therefore diversification as you mention it may not protect you from losses. Obviously we are not talking about option type time value losses here, but I am wondering how is this any different than leveraging entire S&P diversified portfolio. Isn't this pure beta strategy."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Just read the previous posts you had too. Im impressed. I need to do some more research on using margin since I haven‚Äôt turned it on before. Will look back more closely after I learn some more. Thanks
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if I‚Äôm getting this right, to maintain 2:1 leverage you generally purchase more stocks on uptrends, and sell on downtrends? If so, you‚Äôre correct that you will likely never be margin called, but I can‚Äôt help but imagine that the following similar strategy might outperform and with less risk:

Identify a basket of relatively uncorrelated etfs (ie different countries or different sectors). 
After any significant downturn in one sector, open a 3:1 or 4:1 leveraged position in it with $x (where x may be your entire account)
Over time, this leverage should naturally decrease. 
After a significant downturn in a different sector, trim this position to be unleveraged, with the original $x left over to restart a highly leveraged position in the red sector. 

What your strategy is to leveraged SPY, this strategy is to leveraged sector rotation. Only downside I can see are potential tax implications depending on your geography"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Diversified ETFs are great when the market is broadly rising. But what happens when the market broadly drops and then you get margin called? Just have to eat it and move on?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Going through your past posts, unless you have 50k with IB pro its not even worth it? Then how do you pick which ETFs and pick their weightings in your portfolio? Got any calculators or possible books where i can read about this more? You mention dropping to 1.7 leverage is that just based on feelings or how do you go about say a 1.5 leverage vs when to jump to 2x leverage?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The box spreads are to borrow at cheaper rates than IBKR offers?

Do you sell covered calls on the ETF positions or is that not worth it? (Low IV, too much risk of calls going ITM.)"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright, I'd like to ask a few questions for my understanding.

Your leverage based financing comes from both the SPX box shorts as well as margin from your broker? At what account value does this become possible?

From my understanding of smart beta ETFs these seem to be how you avoid your portfolio blowing up overnight ala the March crash? It seems to me like smart-beta ETFs take a more value investment style approach than just a naive market cap weighted mix.

And as far as your experience with this method; How difficult (mechanically and mentally) was your rebalance during March? According to what you said and how I understand the strategy you laid out, is it as mechanically simple as opening your spreadsheet and selling positions to readjust your portfolio to your 2:1 leverage (while also maintaining your US/Ex-US/EM mix)? And then you use the cash accumulated during this period to buy during a recovery? The way I understand this is you never are really looking for entries/exits based on market conditions or market timing; you just stay true to your 2:1 ratio. But mechanically when you're buying to re-leverage your positions are selling short more box spreads or do you just get more margin from your account value increasing?

Sorry for the wall of text; just trying to learn how to be better. Thanks"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"thanks for posting this! any tools for box selling and getting the implied interest rate? my understanding is the bid/ask spread is kinda wide for the boxes a bit far out, so not sure how to pick a ""good"" price.

also do you think the 3x LETFs are too much? Currently doing the boglehead UPRO/TMF [strategy](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=288192) but yours seem better since bonds are getting killed"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't this almost identical to just buying SSO?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain your strategy?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I haven't heard of any of those stocks which means they might be sensible, financially sound boomer stocks. 

&#x200B;

Here, we lose money good sir. 

&#x200B;

Still, congrats!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Nasdaq is up 73% over 1yr
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right now, I'm letting my leverage drift down from 2:1 leverage. If there is a dip, I'm going to buy the shit outta it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not super sure, this portfolio has been at 4 different brokers since I started, and all of the ones before Interactive Brokers don't have a way to show what my returns were over a given time period. I can attest to the portfolio losing about 64% of its value during March at Schwab."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf are you talking about.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"""hold some ETFs"" isn't exactly the kind of advice this sub is looking for."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been doing this since 2018, March 2020 was harsh but by no means a showstopper at all. As I said in another comment, I moved brokers in June 2020, so that's the data I have."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The index funds I use (tilting to value/quality/momentum) as well as the fact that I've borrowed about half a million dollars to invest more in them than I otherwise could with my own money (aka leverage).
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I went through March 2020 with this portfolio just fine. And historically, it wouldve been OK through 2008 and 1929. It loses a lot of money, yeah, but it more than makes up for it during good times."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been doing this since 2018. Account lost about 65% value during March. Obviously, if I had started this in March, my returns would've been mind-boggling, most of these positions have nearly doubled since the March lows, so I would've more than quadrupled my money with this portfolio if I had actually started then."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct, my portfolio (a global portfolio leveraged 2:1 with rebalancing bands) is exactly the same as what MT did (betting on individual banks, selling volatility, leveraging 4:1 with credit cards, and letting leverage rise to 10:1, bringing countless margin calls). When you're done attacking the strawman, maybe you should read my other posts showing how this portfolio went through March 2020 (a 35% decline) while MT was already getting margin call and royally screwed at the 20% drawdown level."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I had seen this before
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the story here ?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol @ people assuming I'm a guy. But thanks, right back at u"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have portfolio margin on?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Link in the OP explains the strategy. You don't need stocks that allow for maximum margin. Actually, you don't want to come close to maximum margin any ways (since it leads to lower compound returns). And smart-beta ETFs > individual stocks."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I've been doing this since 2018, just didn't actually post on WSB until 2020. Went through 2018 Dec, and went through March 2020. When markets drop, you should sell somewhat to keep leverage and risk down.
The underlying portfolio (unleveraged) has been way up against the S&P 500 for the past 10 months. That's why my returns (82%) are more than twice the S&P 500 returns (32%) in that time period, even though I'm currently using less than 2:1 leveraged. This isn't pure beta, it is exposed to value/quality/momentum as well."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Investing in a couple of countries or sectors is extremely risky. And that risk is uncompensated on top. Yeah, even if a country has dropped a lot, newsflash, it can keep dropping! I prefer to diversify across all sectors and countries, eliminate all of the diversifiable risk I don't get paid for, and then just leverage that to the optimal value for maximum returns.  
And yeah, this is a taxable account, I can't just be selling too often. I want this to compound maximally and paying taxes along the way creates a big drag."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been doing this since 2018. And I‚Äôd rather not wait for some GeNeRaTiOnAl DiP to invest (who knows when that‚Äôll be, or IF it‚Äôll happen), I want to make a fuck ton of money via very fast compounding right now."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just look through my posts before, links in the OP"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Me neither. 2:1 leverage means wipeout after a 50% drop. But you‚Äôll want to rebalance leverage and sell some positions (keeping risk controlled) before stocks actually drop that much. That‚Äôs crucial
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Links on OP
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably not worth it with less than 50K but you could do it, IBKR has no minimums. I picked the weights based on my own methods, feel free to copy them if u want. I don‚Äôt know if any book that addresses this specifically, I‚Äôve applied it from many sources of literature. I typically rebalance leverage when I hit either 1.8 or 2.2x leverage. Since valuations are much richer, I‚Äôm being a little lazy rebalancing back up but I probably will soon. Just a bit of harmless market timing. I wouldn‚Äôt go as low as 1.5x leverage, that‚Äôs definitely too conservative for the optimal growth."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes and no.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Borrow at cheaper rates (previous posts discuss this).
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,.5%
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mostly SPX box, a little margin debt as shown in positions. To use boxes, you need portfolio margin, so 100k or more. Otherwise, just margin. Smart beta doesn‚Äôt do much better in crashes (it actually did worse in March than index funds). Smart beta just has a higher expected returns long term, so it‚Äôs my choice of investment for leveraging since I want highest compound return.
In March, I held out and let leverage rise to about 3:1 without selling since the market was quite cheap. I did start selling a bit at that point though to keep the leverage reasonable and in check. Yes, it‚Äôs as simple as selling positions to cover the margin debt and bring down leverage. When I re-lever back up to 2:1, I generally sell a box to cover the debt, yeah. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúcash accumulation ‚Äú, my cash balance is basically always negative. Leverage level is what really matters.
And yes, no entry/exit. Timing the market is virtually impossible. Just use the best ETFs, leverage them to the optimal level, ignore the noise/prognostication, and rebalance based on bands. The only active component is that I let leverage rise if the market is really cheap, and fall if it‚Äôs expensive (like now). But don‚Äôt do TOO much of that either!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No tools out there, I put together my own spreadsheet to calculate what price I need to be filled at today, to get a certain rate over the life of the box. It‚Äôs not really hard math tbh.
HF portfolio is bad. Risk parity can‚Äôt be applied to stocks and LT bonds because the latter have lower Sharpe (a necessary condition for Risk Parity to be efficient). Also, even if it were efficient, you don‚Äôt want to leverage the Mac Sharpe portfolio. That is what Sharpe said you theoretically want to do, but that doesn‚Äôt actually maximize COMPOUNDING. More specifically, UPRO+TMF over bets, I fully expect this portfolio to beat it long term. I‚Äôm not even sure UPRO+TMF can beat regular, global, unleveraged stocks. It has only done so historically in a period of dropping rates, but failed in rising rates. It‚Äôs a joke of a portfolio"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"SSO has higher borrowing costs, charges a 1% management fee, rebalances leverage too frequently, has no factor tilts (value/quality:momentum) and has poor diversification (only US large caps, not small caps and no foreign stocks). This portfolio is superior in virtually every way."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Used to be WSBs was about making money with a good bet. It‚Äôs only been like 2 years that WSBs is now just about wasting money for the fun of it 0_o trying to bring back a bit of that old WSB
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nasdaq is up like 35% in the past 10 months, so I‚Äôve more than doubled it in the comparable time period. That said, I‚Äôm not claiming this will beat everything over any horizon. Thanks to hindsight bias, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find plenty of random investment strategies that will beat this over a short period."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hunned K, lettuce pray üíéüôèüíé"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Out of curiosity, what‚Äôs your purpose behind the boxes (I assume hedging?) and what decision goes into how much you put into the boxes relative to your leveraged position?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now create an account with less than 100k and try the same strategy there. Or even 10k for lulz.

You‚Äôll get decimated by margin rates and fees."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Must say i do find it a little odd that someone like you (someone who uses/pays attention to models, stats, details, math, books) wouldnt keep track of that information yourself without recording it seperate to your broker. Not saying i dont believe you or youre making anythint up, just a little odd is all"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Down 64% then up 82% means you‚Äôre still down about 34%. Unless you somehow made ridiculous returns in short time between your max drawdown and 10 months ago? If so, it would seem like something worth mentioning...

Sorry bud. Something is missing here"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"For wsb, draw something with MS paint maybe?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this is a real specific period of time for these returns during one of the most epic bull runs of our time so for using leveraged money, it seems about average."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Mhm
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't someone just invest in an index fund and get comparable gains?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool. Pretty sure 75% of people use margin. Checkout /r/investing with your ETFs
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You said -65% lol. That‚Äôs not just fine.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, thank you for clarifying, because you could have invested in pretty much anything in March 2020 and doubled fairly easily."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It didn‚Äôt seem very clear in your previous posts
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reality is that you still have the same conceptual risk of ruin, which is that once the market moves enough you are a forced liquidator and have zero capital left over. A risk that doesn't exist with a non margined investor."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone is bro. Just like you would say ‚Äúyou guys‚Äù even if there‚Äôs girls and guys mixed together.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt. That must be the problem.

For $SPX, what credit or debt do you ask for in a 50 wide box spread?

I also wonder what the benefits are of doing this over buying 2x leveraged ETFs."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got it, interesting"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the reply. I will check the tickers. Small cap ETF was probably a big factor and was a good idea. I believe interactive broker's margin rates are lower than most, so that's a good thing. 

Since you've been doing for sometime then, I am wondering if there are periods where you realize/reduce leverage and hold off for a while to buy back again, or you just don't try to time it at all, and rebalance accordingly as you mentioned. And what if there are certain tickers/ETFs that you want to invest in, how's the decision made. Reason why I am asking is that not sure if you have a sophisticated optimum portfolio allocation/correlation calculation etc., or is there a more deeper thinking involved when actually buying and selling, other than times for adjusting for market movements."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No retard, that's what you did. You bought the dip with leverage and mistakenly believe you are doing something else."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate u sir although on the surface your methods terrify me as I still have ptsd from being a full retard on margin with gme
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks did a ninja edit after I saw that... Question above.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you considered covered calls?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why need portfolio margin for boxes? 


I‚Äôm in Canada so bit different perhaps. Have 1m ish and don‚Äôt see any portfolio margin options."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks so much for explaining. Any chance you'd share that spreadsheet? Or if you want to teach a man to fish maybe the math for calculating? I like working w/ numbers but I can't find anything when googling box spreads other than the investopedia stuff.

Also any gotchas when doing this on IB? The investopedia article mentions occasionally selling ITM buying OTM pairs, but that incurs huge assignment risk right? Or is that just RH issue"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,But the correlation has got to be extremely close.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually I am up 500% in the past 12 months. Used to be around 1000-1200% until February came fucking it up.

Only shares and no margin since I'm an europoor.

I think you either have to get really massive gains or decent gains to post them. Anything in the middle might sound like bragging. Easier to just make fun of the old ""inverse WSB to make money"" thing lol"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I used 1yr because 10mo is pretty arbitrary. 


Back testing is legit. A popular index is a fair comparison to an etf portfolio. Testing <1yr is dumb. 


By the way my portfolio is up 80% over 1 day so... must be legit and very good üòé"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The boxes are my way of borrowing money at very cheap rates
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs how I started... No decimation if you use a broker with rock-bottom margin like IBKR.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a spreadsheet that has kept track of account values, amount of leverage, target exposure based on valuations, etc all the way back to when I started in 2018 with a couple dozen Ks. The problem is that you‚Äôre asking about IRR. Do you know how tedious that would be to calculate myself? I don‚Äôt keep track of inflows/outflows, nor the trades I‚Äôve made. And most brokers don‚Äôt create that data for u either so I would have to use MS Finance. IBKR is unique in that you can pick a time period and it actually does spit it out. If I had easy-to-generate data, I would post it. Or you can backtest this yourself with Portfolio Visualizer back to 2016. Or even further back using just a spreadsheet. But my own personal return since 2018? A nightmare."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Returns between mid-March (bottom) and mid June (once stocks had mostly recovered) were obviously extremely high for this portfolio, well past 82%. I was also using higher leverage then (about 3x) since the market was outrageously cheap. Since June I‚Äôve been using closer to 2x leverage."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs something magical here. It does really well in Bull markets, it loses lots of money in Bears, and when you look at it long term, including good and bad, it will compound the most. Its optimal in that I borrow the cheapest (0.5%) and use smart beta ETFs that have the highest expected returns but other than that, it‚Äôs pretty basic and intuitive, no magic"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"During the 10 months shown in the OP, I‚Äôm up 82% while the S&P 500 is up like 32%. So no lol, you can‚Äôt replicate this with index funds."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yip
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure that figure is completely wrong.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs fine in the sense that the portfolio survives, recovers and more than makes up for it (both historically and in real time). If 65% loss is too much for you, this is too high risk for you, easy peasy. I never said it was riskless, only that over the long term, it should have the highest compound return of any similar strategy."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, you want to rebalance and sell stocks as leverage increases way before getting margin called. Risk control and discipline is crucial. What MT was a joke, just held a portfolio that if the market dropped enough, he was just fully out. This portfolio, rebalanced properly, survived even the 1929 crash (yeah, when stocks dropped 90%) and still came out on top long-term."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah that‚Äôs fair
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Credit depends on when the box expires since the credit+time to expiration is what determines the interest rate. See the comment section for a post where I explain how to calculate the rate.
I also answered in this comment section why this is superior to something like SSO (a leveraged ETF)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's really hard to time markets, better to stay roughly close to 2:1 leverage. That said, a bit of market-timing based on valuations is reasonable IMO and the portfolio rn is at 1.7:1 leverage. In theory, I should rebalance as I've hit my lower band, but I'm letting the leverage drop a little right now. The tickers I use are already my ideal choices after a lot of research, if something better comes out, I probably would just ignore it. The tax hit would be too large to sell just to buy other ETFs.  
Trying to optimize with correlations is nearly useless IMO, as everything crashes during market crashes. Smart-beta helps in terms of compound returns so I'm just trying to get as much smart-beta exposure as I can."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry to hear about the losses, here is a better way."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should rebalance the portfolio. So if the market has been dropping, sell some stocks to keep the leverage back at that optimal 2:1 leverage. This risk control is crucial. If done properly, you should never ever get close to actually getting margin called"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely not. That‚Äôs toxic for this portfolio. In order to compound the most long term, you rely on the really great runs (like the past few years). Limiting the upside would be a problem. It‚Äôs also really tax inefficient"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"SPX box collateral requirements with Reg T margin is as large as the box itself. Aka you can‚Äôt actually invest the proceeds. PM OTOH recognizes the boxes are just European risk-free loans due in the future, so you can borrow freely. Note that I‚Äôve borrowed nearly half a Mil yet my Maintenance margin is under 200K. Without PM, MM would be nearly 700K. It just wouldn‚Äôt work at all"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Given a box of X size (say, 50K) matures on Y date, then given an interest rate of 0.5%, what investment today will grow to be 50K by date Y? If X is a year from today, the answer is 49.75K. That‚Äôs how much the box must give u today to borrow at 0.5% for a year. In a spreadsheet, you would just plug in the date in the future, the interest you want, and have it spit out that 49.75K number.
You‚Äôll want to do this with European options (like SPX) to avoid any Ironyman, early assignment fuckery"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt confuse ‚Äúcorrelation‚Äù with ‚Äúsimilar investment‚Äù. Correlation says nothing about the magnitude of returns. USA stocks are highly correlated to international, yet they have absolutely crushed them in the past decade"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Couldn‚Äôt care less if my posts sound like bragging. I‚Äôm here to show fellow redditors a portfolio that has the highest long-term return, that requires absolutely no gut instinct, stock-picking, DD, etc. It‚Äôs a YOLO based on finance theory, but a smart one IMO"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Arbitrary in general but it‚Äôs the data I can easily access. So I‚Äôm not purposefully trying to cherry pick. I told u what the 1Yr return is any ways.
Also, happy for ur gains,"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Short boxes? Sorry not familiar with this broker interface
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see that you mentioned starting with 50k, but don‚Äôt see when. Post that initial growth, e.g. gains for the first year. That‚Äôs much more relatable."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This idiot has never heard of photoshop?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Been using wingmantracker.com instead of Excel for a while now. Works great
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I probably have PTSD from certain frames of reference, grats on your gains and the balls to do it through thick and thin even if it's not a pure WSB yolo, and I'll definitely pick up some combination of the tickers you posted (especially in my retirement account as I like some of your selections that I haven't checked out until now)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure why you're being downvoted. 82% is based on a set of ETFs and as well as leverage.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you can. Nasdaq is up just about as much. And you‚Äôre cherry picking 10mo. Choose 1yr or 2yr etc.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,74%
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay good explanation. I just wouldn't day it was fine. That tells me that it dipped but not too hard. Id say it went down but rebounded fine. 


Still not great given your thing is leveraging and a wipe out is possible."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course that depends on a bunch of just so stories about historical patterns. Including that momentum would have had you selling before the worst of the crash, and that you will never see an intra day crash that either actually or substantially busts you.

Also just fwiw your strategy has the same return profile as a x period levered etf. Which means that sufficient whipsaws would also drain your account even without a substantial crash."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I look forward to tryin it out the losses are just lessons I got retard strength
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have stop losses setup?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reconsider it. Adds excellent cash income. Some cc etf do great. Just sell far OTM in your most boring funds. You‚Äôll pickup barely anything but on a decent size balance, that‚Äôs okay. 

Caveat though as I don‚Äôt know how US tax handles it. 


Looks like not good volume. VTI nothing. VFMF none. 


If you can‚Äôt get deep OTM then no, no point."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hm. Good 2 know.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"May I walk through a concrete example w/ you? I think I'm missing something. I took the 2022/12/16 SPX prices and got this spreadsheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VPl6u5GGcmnjrCfHkSsuT3aEa8U31b6f-OFXyCAyH14/edit?usp=sharing

I think I'm doing something wrong, because the interest amount looks really high and won't annualize anywhere to 0.5%...

(I didn't multiply by 100 for option $s since afaik that won't affect the % at the end)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"But in terms of risk, if the correlation of all your assets is high you will do extremely well for a long time then get crushed towards zero during a bear market."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Account was Merrill at the time and I sold puts to achieve the leverage. No clue how I could post returns or positions, I can‚Äôt even go back more than a year on their platform. But returns are independent of investment amount, you could‚Äôve invested 10K or 100M and if it was the same portfolio I used, you also would‚Äôve achieved the same compound return."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,you're fine. he was being an asshole
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instead of photoshopping gains, I‚Äôd rather generate them. Easier and more profitable YMMV."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"10 months since I moved things to IBKR, that‚Äôs why I used that in OP. I‚Äôve left NASDAQ in the dust, are you serious? NASDAQ up like 35% since mid June, I‚Äôm 82%. I logged in to my previous broker to see account balance in April 05 of 2020, the account was 215k so up about 239% for a year, about 3 times as much as NASDAQ."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It went down in March but rebounded fine. Are you content now?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't use trend momentum, none of these ETFs would sell stocks before ""the worst of a crash"". I use cross-sectional momentum, totally different.  
Regardless, if your point is ""hey this thing can lose a fuck ton of money, very quickly"", then I'd say ""uh yeah, duh"". I didn't say it was riskless. It's got plenty of risk. But your point was ""hey this is also known as what MT did"" then no, you're 100% wrong. Any way you slice it, it is far less risky and I've already proven it in real time \*shrugs\*"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Advice before trying. The books and economists who wrote the books this strategy is based on all agree none of this works unless you are younger than like 50 when you start, have a regular income, your income isnt directly tied to the stock market, and you have no debt. If you fit that and can hold while 75% of your investment disappears in the time of a month (in the case of a crash, which is highly likely sometime relatively soon). You should seriously look into it."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah these are pretty exotic ETFs. And the proceeds would all be taxed at marginal brackets. It‚Äôs a fine idea, just not sure it fits well in this scenario."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can u make it open to everyone with the link? It's asking me to ask you for access via my gmail and I would rather not share my email with u (no offense).
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha I‚Äôm familiar with short boxes. Yours are nice and wide and long dated. Makes sense. Just didn‚Äôt realize they were short boxes instead of long boxes
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Returns aren't the same, because of differences in margin rates and commission tiers. Fixed fees are more noticeable when playing with smaller investment as well.

Also, risk / reward profile is different. While 100% roi at >100k is pretty neat, growing 2k to 4k in a year is hardly wsb material."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So you do have the full data... why not post it all?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So truth be told i don't think this is anywhere close to half the stupid shit that gets posted here. However, the period you've proven it in is basically a strongly directional market without a ton of whipsaws, so that's kind of ideal for the strategy. Yes March was bad but nowhere near enough to bust it, and then basically a straight recovery afterwards. A 3x QQQ ETF was up 100%+ in 2020 and 300%+ TTM. Eventually it will go substantially to zero, and negative compounding of volatility is nasty for it and for you."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I am young with relatively 0 debt but will make that happen first and I‚Äôve had more than 75% loss in a day I can deal
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ballsy. I like it.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm literally on the lowest commission and margin tier thou... actually nvm I don‚Äôt need to prove to you that this can be implemented with less money. Do it if you want to make money, or don‚Äôt, idgaf."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I already responded to this exact point on another comment don‚Äôt feel like posting again sorry.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"A 2:1 leveraged portfolio gets margin called with a 35% drawdown using Reg T. You're saying ""that's not anywhere near to bust this"" yet that IS enough to bust most leveraged strategies, and more than enough to bust MT. Yet this is just like MT?  
3x leverage is past the optimal Kelly criterion, that's why QQQ will go to zero long-term, it's overbetting. 2:1, rebalanced leveraged is the optimal compound return INCLUDING whipsaws. You need to understand that. This isn't doing really well because there have been no whipsaws. It already is optimal given whipsaws. And when there are no whipsaws, well this does even better (but not as good as overbetting like 3x ETFs)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ur using ""last"" prices. Use the bids for the sales and asks for the buys. Makes a big diff. Ex: rn the OTM 4000 put would only cost 402.7, not the 432 you have. That right there almost entirely makes up for the $27.5 difference you're seeing."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya I saw that but it is misleading. You mentioned you do have it all on separate tracking but didn‚Äôt post that.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"""optimal"" based on historical vol patterns, which on a long enough horizon eventually get breached. just like every other strategy that this ""isn't similar to."""
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doh! okay that makes sense, ideally I'd be able to get some combination of prices so the ""Credit today"" is $99+ and over almost 2 year timeframe I'd get close to annualized .5% interest rate, does that seem reasonable?

Does IB work similar to RH in this scenario, where you get the ~$99 in cash to invest but your margin buying power uses up $100 as collateral (but you don't pay margin interest)?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You want me to post the account values of the past 3 years that I tracked on excel? For one thing, a good portion of it comes from savings, not actual returns. Also, I could literally make numbers up. I‚Äôll just stick to posting actual account returns from IBKR and if people don‚Äôt believe me that it was also very good since before (which it obviously was stocks have done great for the past decade, and leveraging was even better), then I can‚Äôt do anything for the skeptics"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Getting a 0.5% fill on the Dec 2022 date is challenging. I'd put a limit order and just leave it there, it might take a few hours to fill. Also, there's hidden liquidity in these options apart from the prices you see on the order book. That's why i recommend you just figure out what price you need to get filled (just back-calculate what cell B6 needs to be given an interest rate) and then put a limit box order with that. You might have to massage the limit price up to 0.55-0.6% to get a fill.  
You NEED to use PM to make this work. If you use Reg T margin (like RH) then your maintenance margin goes up by the value of the box so it is completely useless. PM is risk-based as understands that the box is European and with expiry in 2022 so it doesn't increase your MM at all (or only a teeny bit)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya man. Need to see it all. All the trades all the data. Then I‚Äôll copy it because you said started with 50k. Probably will die though given peak bull.


I guess misleading is the wrong word. I just want the data. All of it."

if u are writing your own calls then u are part of the problem... and u are the same as hedge fund trash. when it moons your calls u wrote will make ur money zero.....

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Melvin did cover their short the Friday after RH restricted trading.  These people just can‚Äôt let go.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I bought 100 shares I'm now an evil hedgfund, sorry, can't hear you over the sounds of the engines of my private jet engine.

Also calls wont make zero money. If they expire worthless at whatever you set as the expiry, you keep both the premium and your shares. If they become in the money, you can buy them back and write new call contracts, or you can let them be exersized  and they make you exactly as much money as you set as the price times a hundred per contract. And you can use that money to buy back in, get more shares if you think it's still gonna rise in price."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Forced liquidation isn‚Äôt profit silly.

üòâüòè"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a meme stock and ü¶ç are trading back and forth.  How would them still having the short position and not yet covering affect the price the last few weeks?  You‚Äôre not making any sense.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would keep the IV higher because people are assuming they haven't covered, I guess if they did cover it can still be this high just based on incorrect assumptions though. So basically no one knows for sure if all the firms covered in January, so it'll either squeeze again if they didn't or eventually tank if they did. I personally don't think all of them got out though, cause when it comes to a lot of them, their greed outweighs their logic. I guess we'll see."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was what I was thinking, also I think in February when it dropped from $483 down to like $38, they probably got greedy and thought that they could get it down to the single digit range and breakeven instead of covering for a loss, but it shot back up again so now they're in the same situation as before."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh that's a fantastic deal if it they made it work, I can understand their greed but unfortunately now they r fuk."
2021-04-05 02:11:41,wallstreetbets,"$ASO is a powder keg & will blow soon $ASO is Academy sports and outdoors. They are a sports equipment store and a hunting store that sells guns & ammo. I would describe them similar to Dick's but more focused on their core selling points, they aren't spending money making their stores look like a extravegent mall. I have been too ASO many times and overall enjoy their store & from my personal experience they have been consistently busy this past year and the days ammo arrives there is always a line around the building at 7 am of people trying to get some before they sell out. 

ASO IPO'd in October of 2020. ASO is a fundamentally undervalued stock. Last week they absolutely smashed earnings by doubling EPS. Estimated was .46 and actual was 1.09 Their revenue increased as well. Their net sales increased 18% over last year. They have a market cap of 2.63 B and trade at a P/E of 7.66 as compared to Dick's which trades at a P/E of 13.85.  As you can see this stock is criminally undervalued as compareded to its peers. IPO lockup period ended on 3/31 which caused a negative dip on open that day but the stock finished postive on the day as there was not a mass sell off as shorters of the stock had hoped for. 

 The stock has been shorted from the start because I believe it was just lumped into the typical brick & mortar category and will just assumed would bleed out due to online shopping. This was a grave miscalculation as ASO provides a niche varitey of products that the online space is not fulfiilling adequetly & their top compeitor Dicks has been backing out of like guns and ammo. They have a current short interest of 39% with a public float of 31 M. The stock currently is at a all time high of $29, that means every single instution that shorted this stock is negative now and they have 9 days to cover their positions. With some more volume and upward pressure in this stock and we could see a squeeze similair to the one that happened with RKT. I don't see this stock tripling or anything of the scale that GME had but I do see a substaintial price increase soon if the right factors materialize. 

Open interest for 4/16 30 strike calls are huge and if the volume comes in and pushes the stock up we could be looking at quite the squeeze for this bad boy. 

TLDR: ASO is a fundamentally undervalued stock that is currently trading at a ATH with high short interest which makes it prime for a squeeze. 

Positions: (9) 4/16 30 strike &  (2) 4/16 25 strike calls 

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice spend your money however you choose."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Last updated short interest was March 15th. Stock has had above average volume last week of trading. Would not surprise me to see that some shorts have already covered.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a poor so I only have one ASO call option $25 @ 4/16 and about 30 shares but both are covering all the bags I'm holding. Thinking tomorrow of selling some other stocks to load up on more calls and and shares.

Was just at my local one today - four shipments of ammo sold out, weights and other bro gear sold out and now their fishing department is moving merch like hotcakes. Ammo and weight purchases aren't going to slow down anytime soon, I like the stock"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"First time I'm doing a non gme related post here but I wholeheartedly believe this. 

The simple fact that academy sells hunting and fishing licences pulls them out of the brick and mortar category, in my opinion. If I had extra RN I'd put some into academy."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,In on the ASO train.  2500 shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"ASO's direct competition for firearms and ammo is Cabella's and Bass Pro, not Dick's. You will want to compare more to them than Dick's if you're focusing just on that.

It would be nice to hear that they are turning things around cause Academy had been typically low on stock and quality goods for years before going public. After paying out the butt for naming rights to the Broncos stadium they seemed to really fall off in public eye.

Aside from firearms and ammo, do you have more things pointing towards them turning around? How is their online shopping experience? Their distribution and stocking? Are they out performing in other areas than firearms? Have they made good moves on the board?"

But the company doesnt have a moat theres nothing new or innovative about it. People need to buy stuff and this place has some of that stuff. If you got in before last week youre gonna make a killing but if youre just getting in now its a gamble. 

Id like to get in but its gonna be up another 10% or more today before fidelity pre market opens."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"""They have 9 days to cover their positions""

They don't HAVE to cover until they get margin called. Terrible DD. Just vaguely told us ASO fills some niche online retailers don't without actually telling us what that might be.

If it's guns and ammo you wanna long, just go after an actual gun company lol.

Personally I'm gonna open a bear credit spread on this as soon as I free up some buying power."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes me want to sell naked calls
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that it's currently trading at ATH has me worried. Bigger potential to drop than to rise.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Academy sucks. People are hyping all of these dying companies. Everything is overpriced there

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre saying insider trading might have some advantages
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Serious question - I thought insider sell-offs needed to be reported months in advance?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs **undervalued** based on latest earnings. Price is still catching up + gamma squeeze + short squeeze play. There are bigger players than WSB already playing ASO for the squeezes. 40% short interest is no joke when the gamma hits this week.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the increased firearm and ammo sales has less to do with reopening than politics. People buy guns/ammo because they're afraid Democrats will limit them in the future.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm hoping we break $35 tomorrow
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Go eat some more crayons

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,40 is a long way up
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,i doubt it. RKT had a similar setup and had 10x volume on the short-covering. i'm looking for a day with 15 million shares trading hands
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I doubt they all covered and even so, it's still undervalued I believe"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. Not that hard to sell the shit. Just tell em the democrats are gunna take their guns and watch sales explode. Pretty tires of 9mm being 1 dollar a round though (last time i bought a couple boxes). Id love to go shooting but i cant justify the cost of the ammo
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I live in the South as well and I can guarantee there are way more than 40 percent of households with guns down here.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Im in the pnw cant find ammo for nothing. Occasionaly some 17hmr or shotgun ammo.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Want to know what's also gone up since 2001?

Population."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,WTF I love guns now?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely, the one by me has a fishing dept basically as big as the whole outdoor section at my Dicks. They have a peewee league football and baseball section and the middle of the store is basically like a Sears clothing store - complete with their own brand of jeans that are knock off Levis but start at $17. Not sure how I missed their IPO but I'm kicking myself"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not with high demand creating an inelastic market.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It sounded like he thinks they have to cover their positions by the 15th or so lmao. You are 100% correct regardless of OP's intentions
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No it smells like a 10 bagger in a weeks time
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks I‚Äôm up 125% so far.  We‚Äôll see how far this can drop

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,But gun and ammo sales soared way before the election in last March.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be cool. I set a limit buy order on a whim for $30 on Friday when the market was closed and it dipped just enough today to trigger it. Guess I'm in for a few shares.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"$40 would be a 30% increase on a low average volume, fundamentally undervalued stock that‚Äôs going to get a lot of attention (volume) this week. Lot of open interest on those options going to cause a gamma squeeze... the dominos fall one by one."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They look at me shitty like when I go in to my local store. Limit me to 2 boxes. Hell I started buying online as well, and it‚Äôs either limits or out of stock.

A funny. I was once in a store and there was a much older gentleman at the counter with me,and he said it‚Äôs a good start to have 1000 rounds per weapon. I‚Äôve been following his advice ever since. Money in the bank I say."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is the reason I bought a Glock 31, no one buys 357 SIG, everything on the planet can be sold out, but I can always find 357."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You really don‚Äôt have to say that.  I live in the South and guns have always been popular here.  The prices however are ridiculous right now.  I haven‚Äôt been to the range in over a year.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Got that right. And more than one.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why we need more guns
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it should have been pretty obvious that the D trifecta would lead to a spike in demand for both guns and ammo, regardless of your position on the political spectrum or location in the world.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that is great advice. Hopefully this shit dies down a little and i can load up. .223 rounds are goddamn impossible to find. Hell i bought the gun and couldnt find ammo for months. Most expensive paper weight i ever bought lol. 

Most likely will buy in bulk next time im on the prowl. Im to busy losing money in the casino now"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I went one time in Raleigh, nc probably in oct. Wednesday morning, tryna just get a lane and shoot for a couple hours, was willing to swallow the bullet cost. The line was out the door. I bought some ammo and mags and left."

2021-04-05 01:36:48,wallstreetbets,"The US Gov't has a huge incentive to massively underreport inflation **TL;DR: The US federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation. A 1% underreporting of inflation saves the US gov't between $500 billion and $1 trillion per year. It's likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades.**

For background, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates inflation. It releases a measure known as the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The formula used to calculate CPI is rather complex and opaque, and has been changed numerous times over the years. The effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number. [\[1\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)

Many government revenues and expenditures are inflation-linked, either directly or indirectly.

**Directly linked:**

1. Social security payments

Social security payments are linked to a measure known as CPI-W (very similar to the CPI) [\[2\]](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/COLA/colasummary.html). Every year, the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation. It has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth \~**$37 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by **$370 billion.**

2) Tax brackets

Tax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation [\[3\]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111715/are-tax-brackets-adjusted-inflation.asp). This means, when the government underreports inflation, more people move up into higher tax brackets. It's hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues.

3) Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities

These are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back, in both interest and principle, according to inflation. They are linked to the CPI. These securities (known as TIPS) compromise \~8% of the US federal debt [\[4\]](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/tips.aspx). This is **\~$2.24 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by **$22 billion.** There are also increases to the interest payments on this debt.

**Indirectly linked:**

1. Debt interest payments

Investors will demand higher returns from Treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation. The US government has **\~$26 trillion** in Treasury debt. The yearly cost of servicing this debt is \~1-2% of that, roughly **$378 billion** in 2020. If investors were to expect higher inflation, this yearly cost would go up by \~**$260 billion** for every 1% increase in expected inflation.

There are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation, these are just the main ones I could find. When we add up all these policies, we see that underreporting inflation by just 1% can save the government **between $500 billion and $1 trillion a year**. This is 30% of the entire tax revenue of the US government. Underreporting inflation by 3-4% a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year.

**Evidence of underreporting**

There has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited. Is there any evidence that the US government has in fact been understating inflation?

1. Changes to the CPI formula

""Originally, the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods. In this case, the CPI was a cost of goods index (COGI). However, over time, the U.S. Congress embraced the view that the CPI should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living.1Ôªø Consequently, the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index (COLI).

Over the years, the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions. According to the¬†BLS, the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate. The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution. Substitution, the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes, changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket.Ôªø The overall result tends to be a lower CPI. However, critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a¬†COGI¬†to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the¬†U.S.¬†government to report a lower CPI."" [\[5\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)

Essentially, the methodology used to calculate the CPI was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported. When a good is considered to be of ""increased quality,"" its price increase is lowered to reflect this. When the price of one good goes up, its relative weighting in the CPI is reduced and another, lower-priced good is ""substituted"" for it.

2) Rent

In 2005, the average US rent was $755. In 2019, it was $1,164 [\[6\]](https://www.deptofnumbers.com/rent/us/). This is an increase of **54%**, or an average yearly increase of 3.1%. During the same time, the CPI has gone from 191.6 to 252.4 [\[7\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL), which is only a **31%** increase, or an average yearly increase of 1.9%. If we use rent as the true measure of inflation, CPI has underreported inflation by **1.1%** per year. Keep in mind that, during the period just mentioned, the US experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen, during the 2007-2008 crisis. The housing bubble was already far along by 2005 [\[8\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA). Nonetheless, rent increases managed to outstrip the CPI.

What do you think? Is the US government massively underreporting inflation?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Inflation is a tax nobody has to vote for, but everybody has to pay"" - Scooby Doo"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If official CPI inflation rises, the Federal Reserve will be under enormous pressure to raise rates and if that happens the debt fueled US gov gravy train comes to a crashing halt. The cost of new debt rises along with the maintenance cost of existing debt as it gets rolled over and soon almost all of the available tax money is going towards interest payments.

All you need to know."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are they under-reporting actual inflation? Probably. Are they under-reporting loss of purchasing power? Definitely. And this is by design. The ""hedonic quality adjustment"" is used to factor out any improvement in quality or function from the cost of an item even if the item gets more expensive to purchase.  Here is a perfect example of this with explanation for new vehicles:
https://wolfstreet.com/2020/11/11/my-pickup-truck-car-price-index-for-2021-models-crushes-official-cpi-for-new-vehicles/

They regularly issue revisions, even after the final number is set, due to changes in methodology, but really it's someone's agenda. Go look at the GDP time series on FRED. It used to be that the 4th quarter of 2008 had a huge negative number on it, they went back and smoothed the data to reflect it occurring over a longer time period...

Here‚Äôs a clue:

https://www.longtermtrends.net/m2-money-supply-vs-inflation/

Why?

Global Trade.

All of our consumer goods, and much of our food is being made in countries with fractional CoL and ‚Äî critically ‚Äî currencies pegged to the dollar.

For the last 30 years, no matter what we have done to the money supply, the cost of these goods has remained the same.

That is not to say that we haven‚Äôt been experiencing inflation all along.  We have, but only with hard assets, things that can‚Äôt be commodified, made remotely, and shipped around the world.  Residential real estate.  Equities.  Kryptonite currencies. 

People look at the rise in the market at proclaim it a bubble.  No, that‚Äôs inflation.  All that money is simply seeking the greatest return on capital.

So anytime an ape tries to tell you that inflation is ‚Äúright around the corner‚Äù, tell them about the last 30 years and give them the link above."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a fun position if you think you‚Äôre edgy and sophisticated, but the manner in which CPI is calculated is transparent. 

There are lots of reasons to believe they‚Äôve made bad choices regarding what specific variables to include in the calculation, but that is also public knowledge. 

US government statistics are almost certainly reliable sources regarding the thing they say they‚Äôre calculating in the manner in which they say they‚Äôre doing it. 

If you want to say that CPI should include things like housing, education, or healthcare I think that‚Äôs a good argument to have, but it still wouldn‚Äôt mean the feds were lying."

Is the US under-reporting inflation?

I think your post is spot on and presumably many here agree.  **FWIW, if I were a govt rep I'd under-report inflation too.... job preservation.**"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another incentive is that it allows them to say that healthcare expenditures have outstripped inflation and use formulas in place to reduce Medicare payments to hospitals.

Inflation is relative - if the price of groceries goes up, this affects lower income more since this is a good portion of their budget 

If the price of say fiberglass goes up - this could affect rich people buying yachts

While rent is a good indicator, at the same time there is technology DEFLATION, back in 2005 a flat screen could cost $10,000 (Yes, you heard that right, the first flat screens to come out were super expensive) now you can get the same one for $300"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice read
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"George W. Bush stopped reporting M3: the amount of new money brought into the economy. That‚Äôs your inflation.

Congressman Paul, the elder, asked Ben Bernanke whether ‚Äòquantitative easing‚Äô wasn‚Äôt just another name for inflation. Ben Bernanke said yes.

The government keeps inflation low because any increase massively increases the interest needed to pay for the debt which is huge.

The debt has increased massively. The Orange toddler from Trump Tower gave his buddies $1.9 T (or thereabouts), the stock market got $1.5T when the market crashed, and now there have been stimulus packages that have further increased the debt, and there‚Äôs a massive infrastructure bill that‚Äôs going to increase the debt further.

Debt per se isn‚Äôt a bad thing and when it is used to relieve the pain of a pandemic and subsequent economic hardship you can defend that. An infrastructure bill is going to increase the debt but it‚Äôs also going to provide a lot of economic improvements.

Inflation is going to be kept low so that the cost of servicing that debt won‚Äôt rise too dramatically. At the same time the wealthy (the actual wealthy, not some clods who have a single million bucks) and corporations are going to pay more taxes, as they should have all along. At that point servicing the debt is not going to be all that much of a problem.

The other side of the coin is Weimar/Zimbabwe. If you insisted that inflation went up and it actually went through the roof, like in Weimar/Zimbabwe, the economic fallout would/will crash the world economy for the next century.

It‚Äôs not the most honest thing in the world to futz around with the inflation numbers, its much **much** cheaper than allowing the economy to collapse because the debt can no longer be financed.

Think of it like Brexit: you can think it‚Äôs a good idea until the real costs have to be dealt with. Now the Brits are well, truly and royally fucked and there‚Äôs no going back for them. They will never be able to dial back the clock. So would you not want the inflation to reach ‚Äòactual numbers‚Äô because that‚Äôs going to cause pain on levels you never thought you were going to see in your life and you shouldn‚Äôt hope for it."

If dollar turns out to be a pile of shit and the official inflation statistic can't be trusted, what happens to the value of dollar and the entire US economy?

It fucking dies. That's what.

Now, I know, I know. ""But hedgies do retarded shit like that all the time!"" Yeah but this is **for profit** hedgies, and not **I don't give a fuck** 9-5 bureaucrats. Nobody in the government truly cares enough to pull a scam this big for no profit to themselves."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not only that, but there's a running debate on whether CPI accurately captures the full state of the consumer economy. It focuses on a 1940s model of durable goods and basic essentials, but ignores elements of ""fashion"" and conspicuous consumption. This was true in the 60s -80s, and now is compounded by a discussion in academia as to whether knowledge goods are also missed - i.e. internet disposables such as virtual currencies, video games, educational products, etc.. There is also the whole of the medical field that is ignored, despite privatized medicine in the US being the biggest cluster fuck in modern civilization, with the US being the only developed nation without some form of nationalized healthcare for all.

Plenty of studies show that the US economy creates artificial scarcity to rape its citizens of goods and services that in any other country in the world are considered basic staples and utilities. The CPI itself reflects this short coming of myopic fascination with profits before people."

So if the government were underreporting inflation it would be pretty easy to call them out. 

Inflation also eats into tax revenue or goverment spending power."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. It‚Äôs not under reporting the CPI. 

But that isn‚Äôt the same as inflation.

The money printer works differently these days.  The cash gets stuck in banks where they are required to hold it.

Offshoring production drives down costs faster than money gets printed so goods get cheaper.  But, all this cash is sitting around with no place to go.  So we get really low interest rates and inflated stock prices.  

This is great if you borrow money to buy stock. 

I wonder who would do that?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like FUD. the fed/bankers have all the tools necessary to keep the housing market and food prices stable. we will never have a housing shortage or food shortage that will cripple our economy. our labor force and natural resources are too strong. this is not venezuala.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"one factor to take into account with respect to housing prices is that we are trending away from older building technologies. going ""green"" means harvesting less lumber in favor of steel and concrete, and implementing solar/geothermal powered HVAC in favor of gas. these technologies are still expensive but will trend down year over year."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,True that there is an incentive to under report. But also keep in mind that inflation is highly personal - what is bad for one person (tenant) is good for another (landlord)

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rent outpaces CPI because people move to popular places. Forcefully move the majority of Americans back to rural BFE would be one way to drive down aggregate rent increase 

I‚Äôve recently stayed in more than one BFE town where local retail was paying ~$15 by necessity because nobody of working age wants to work or live there. Places where rent can be ~$500 or less"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has been a controversial topic for a long time but there is some legitimacy in the need to re-evaluate these things because the way people fulfil their needs changes over time.

Some good examples of this would be personal communication & entertainment - in the 1980s vs 2020s, there has been a complete shift from landlines and cable tv to cell phones and internet.  Cell phones and internet existed in the 1980s but were extremely expensive.  So as they get included into the ""basket of goods"" it looks better for inflation because the price of those services (on a quality of services level) is dropping.

Another place there was a similar shift over the same time period was meals eaten at home vs dining out.  In the 1980s, dining out or getting takeout was a special occasion, now it is much more common.  In fact I think before the pandemic it may have overtaken the meals prepared at home."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do know the Fed lying about inflation would be extremely difficult seeing that that there are various  ways other companies/organizations can easily calculate it.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,There killing inflation next year or 3‚Äôor 4 Q
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fed has openly said, repeatedly, that they monitor PCE. Why? Because cpi reflects spending preferences, not headline inflation.

Frankly, idk how you could dive into how the fed monitors inflation and somehow not even mention PCE when they talk about it constantly and have published literature on it that‚Äôs easy to find. It‚Äôs even more baffling that you‚Äôve neglected this while mentioning TIPS."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wrote another post making fun of this, and I do think it's kind of dumb, but here are responses to the two arguments here.

1. Changed methodology: You have to change the method of calculating the CPI over time for it to be an effective measure. You have to, for example, adjust which goods belong in the basket. If horseshoe prices have been going up, that's not inflation if people don't really pay to shoe horses anymore and just want tires on their cars instead. Otherwise, your inflation measure would be kinda dumb, since very little economic growth has driven resources into making horseshoes cheaper, but it has directed a lot into the automobile industry. Now cars last a lot longer, and we don't have unsafe lemon-type vehicles like the Ford Pinto. If you thumb through *Wealth of Nations*, Adam Smith is concerned with the relative prices of wool and linen (the latter used for durable workwear in his period, similar to denim today) over time. But obviously that index would mismeasure inflation today.
2. Rent: This is not a sound argument. ""Look, one component of the basket of goods has gone up faster than the rest. So that means the measure isn't working."" Some of the goods in the basket will go up faster than the rest, like healthcare. Others won't, like gasoline, airline tickets, or computer components. There are also other things going on with housing costs. First, actual rents and owner-equivalents of rent (what owners pay themselves to live in their own homes) are both factored into the score. At least some of the OER increase is driven by asset price inflation. Second, smaller households are becoming normal, so people are consuming more housing. Third, people are choosing to relocate to place where rent is expensive. Cheap rent exists, just in cities like Detroit or Cleveland, or most of rural America. Instead, the US population is becoming geographically concentrated in big growing cities and their suburbs, where rent is higher. But that's not necessarily inflation, so much as a broad shift in consumer preferences toward upscale versions of the same thing--kind of like the shift toward upscale casual dining or upscale fast food like Shake Shack, rather than good ol' Applebees and McDonald's. When there's high inelastic demand (people keep moving to San Francisco and complaining how damn expensive it is, or people keep getting quadruple bypass surgery even though insurance is really expensive), expect the prices of that thing to go up. That's not necessarily indicative of overall inflation--since consumers experience things like high housing and medical costs as a reduction in their real incomes, they may spend less on things for which they have elastic demand."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yet another problem with this thesis is that it assumes that the government has an incentive to try to save money, and that's why it's underreporting inflation.

Have you seen the size of the federal budget deficit? Saving money is the one thing they're trying *not* to do."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> In 2005, the average US rent was $755. In 2019, it was $1,164 [6]. This is an increase of 54%, or an average yearly increase of 3.1%. During the same time, the CPI has gone from 191.6 to 252.4 [7], which is only a 31% increase, or an average yearly increase of 1.9%. If we use rent as the true measure of inflation, CPI has underreported inflation by 1.1% per year.  

Desirable land is not increasing at the same rate as the population who want it, so housing/rent prices seem like they would be increasing faster than inflation.  No problem with the rest of your points though."

The other side of inflation from my understanding is that the demand plus cash has to exceed supply.  With globalization and automation, supply has increased to meet demand.  If you look at TVs for instance, I bought a 30‚Äù TV in 2008 for $300.  I just bought a 55‚Äù 4K TV for $300.  Looks like deflation if we look at the tech sector."

The consumer price index gives a fairly good view of inflation.  As you can see,  despite it generally being cheaper to produce the items in the regular basket,  the price has increased most between 1974 and 2021. 

Coincidentally in 1971 the US Dollar became a fiat currency.  No longer tied to the gold standard, but based on trust in the US government.  

https://www.thebalance.com/is-the-federal-reserve-printing-money-3305842

The S&P 500 is up 20% since March last year. Has the US economy grown by 20%? I don't think it has. So what we are seeing is the result of inflation. If the companies haven't grown, but the price has increased, then the dollar must be worth less. And if the dollar is worth less, we call that inflation. 

Incidentally the dollar has fallen 8% to the euro in the same length of time (despite the EU issuing ‚Ç¨1.5billion in QE in that period) and the dollar has fallen 12% to the pound despite QE from the UK government in the billions, and the dollar has fallen 98% to the currency that shall not be named.  

People say the stock market is in an ATH bubble.  I disagree.  It's worth exactly the same as it has always been worth,  the dollar is just worth less."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think GDP deflator is a more accurate representation of inflation than the inflation itself. The last 10-12 years has been tremendous for assets due to low interest rates. My theory is that due to technology our economy has become more and more efficient. If every year they can bring corn yields up 2% and inflation was at 2% then corn price would remain flat. You get what I'm saying? If the dollar is just supply and demand then in order to counteract increased demand for dollars ( DXY up) they could print more dollars to bring it down. It doesn't mean the demand got lower however. If the printer gets jammed than we'll see whats under the cloak. Until then, SPY 500c.

Edit: I completely forgot to make the point about assets. When assets fell during March of last year, look at what happened to DXY? It moon'd. Showing deflation. However, printing money, brought DXY back down to show inflation. However, what everybody and their grandmas did was take their newfound $2400 fortune and put it into equities rather than buying goods. This means the demand for dollars in a goods and rent market was actually low. Hence why we don't see CPI increasing by much. When people take profits, they want to buy a ton of corn and the demand in goods market for dollars goes up. Personally, I believe there are two very valid perspectives to COVID induced asset increases. One is that we saw alot of technological advancements that made every day easier for even post COVID era, meaning where SPY and QQQ are right now is justifiable. Two is that this market is a ponzi scheme fueled by money printing. Meaning SPY and QQQ grew unjustifiably. This argument, which I suppose you are going for, means that assets are facing the blunt of the inflation, meaning this year we probably had 5%+ worth of inflation and CPI isn't reflecting it as it is more concerned with the goods market rather than the equities market. Personally, I think it's a mixture of both. I don't know though, I'm just a slightly more evolved form of monkey floating on a rock traveling very fast around a glowing gas ball trying to make sense of something seemingly so abstract."

I think the first thing you should think about with your argument is the following: is the government a person? What financial incentives do the people calculating the CPI get from under reporting? My understanding is it is a substantial group of people throughout the country that contribute data and calculating the CPI so it would have to be a fairly big conspiracy to have it reported intentionally incorrect, don't you think?"

**roughly 40% of all USD in existence was created in the last year.**

that's inflation.  it has to go somewhere.  the elites getting that QE put that money in assets rather than consumer goods though... real estate, stock market, voldemort, etc.  the result is asset price inflation is through the fucking roof.  there are tons of graphs comparing QE vs asset price inflation and it's a near total correlation.

here's why it matters.  when elites issue money to themselves and their buddies via QE, the money is still being created.  their net worth is going through the fucking roof.  they went up 1000%, but you and i and the rest of us retards went down 998% in the grand total of USD holdings, and then they brag about having only 2% inflation."

Not limited to just my car, my wife's three-year-old car value is only 2,000 less than what we bought it new for.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"While an interesting data point and the ""hedonic quality adjustment"" is at *best* a highly-questionable extremely subjective adjustment, the wolf street metric is far from conclusive. The fact that the F150 and Camry metrics diverge so much is itself a sign that looking at a single model doesn't tell you much.

The F150 of the 90s was something my home-builder neighbor bought for work. Today's F150 is a status symbol. It's middle America's Macbook. Like the article says, Ford killed off most of their other vehicles because the margins on trucks are so much better. The price of an F150 is up so much not because of inflation in materials or manufacturing costs, but because rural and suburban Americans are happy to get jacked to the tits in debt to buy them as status symbols. Debt is an important part of that equation because when borrowing costs go down, prices on things people finance go up. Total cost of ownership isn't up as much as the sticker price would have you believe.

A much better comparison would be to look at a 1990 F150 and find the absolute closest thing to it that you can. Which isn't easy because trucks have become such status symbols even the most barebones models aren't comparable to the ones from the 1990s. 

That is perhaps itself a different sort of inflation. Maybe an F150 built to 1990 specs would cost only 21% (the New Vehicle CPI since 1990) more today than in 1990. But nobody is making 1990 F150s so it doesn't matter. If you need a pickup truck for work then you're paying 2021's inflated pickup truck prices whether you want the last 30 years of improvements and changes or not. The hedonic quality adjustment might say you're getting way more truck for your money, and it might even be right, but if it's all a bunch of stuff that doesn't make the truck more valuable for your purposes then it isn't actually a quality improvement."

Todays trucks are twice the size they were 2 decades ago and better reliability and manufacturer subsidized lending means financing over 8 years isn't quite as stupid as it was 20 years ago.  What's happening in the pickup truck market is the same thing companies like BMW and Mercedes have been doing for 20 years.  High MSRPs so you can brag to the neighbors about the $80k truck you bough financed at 0% interest for 8 years or leased for the low low price of $650/month.

The only way housing prices are going down is if interest rates go up.  The cities have gotten so expensive that the people from the city are cashing out and throwing their financial heft around in the suburbs thanks to COVID and the myth that their bosses will continue to let them work from home after this is all over"

Also, US inflation data isn't compiled by the Federal Reserve, but by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics - and real-time inflation metrics are compiled by literally every investment bank and quant fund worth their money, to guess the next inflation report's direction.

If central banks have a bias, they have a bias to ***overcompensate*** for inflation, and have done so for decades. Boards of central banks are all about rising and lowering rates - having rates at zero and them ... not doing much of anything, is unusual.

I'm in my 20s and I know darn well I'm never seeing a PENNY of my SS money, it will be bankrupt far before then. Why should I have to pay into the system that will never benefit me? SS is yet another instance of government claiming they can do something better than you (saving for your future) for your own good, and failing at it miserably. Put all your SS money for 40 years into a 1% CD and you will have more money than SS will ever pay you in the ~10 years you get to collect, guaranteed. A politician needs to bite the bullet: anyone over 40, you get the rest of SS, everyone under gets a tax credit for 10 years, start saving money. Teach public school kids the value of SAVING and INVESTMENT and how TAXES work instead of watching movies in class and art appreciation, and you have taken huge steps to solve the problem for future generations.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is intentional because it allows the government to run huge deficits and take on massive debt.

Inflation doesn‚Äôt exactly incentivize investment. Sure, people who have money will prefer to park it in assets like stocks as opposed to parking it in a savings account. But for people without money, inflation blocks the pathway to saving (by increasing the amount that must be spent on basic living costs) and also destroys incentives to save, even if someone has the ability (because rock-bottom interest rates go along with inflation). 

The idea that low inflation and high interest rates cause people to hoard cash is a fallacy. Yes, low inflation and high interest rates may incentivize leaving money in a savings account as opposed to stocks, but leaving money in a savings account is not the same as burying money in a coffee can in the back yard. The banks loan out that money, making that capital available to the market for productive use."

I would support this if it was well thought out. Perhaps they adjust student loan maximums based on the economic utility of the degree program.

IE: liberal arts degrees see a -30% reduction in student loan maximums and hard science degree candidates get an economic opportunity grant. 

Other than that, I'd like to see a greater investment made outside of big higher ed. 

Like tax money going to fund corporate partnered/sponsored training programs where we both pay interns a fair wage and incentivize businesses to provide OJT in fields that are currently H1B incentivized. 

I'd also like to see money go toward funding small business startups with low interest cap loans that come with lower thresholds to borrow.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Gas has gotten cheaper where I‚Äôm at. At one point it was below $2 a gallon during that spiff between Russia and Saudi Arabia.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I think a jar of private label almonds is about $16.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">How about anything else? Want some pecans? $18/lb.

That's not inflation, that's due to global warming and droughts in tree nut growing areas. Prices spiked in 2019 for instance due to the droughts in 2018. On the whole though US domestic pecan prices have been trending down since 2017. By end of 2020 they were **really** low. ([https://site.extension.uga.edu/pecan/2020/10/whats-going-on-with-the-pecan-market/](https://site.extension.uga.edu/pecan/2020/10/whats-going-on-with-the-pecan-market/))

To grow 1 pound of almonds require **1900** **gallons** of water in drought-ridden, fire-ravaged California. Even almonds though, while a bit higher now than usual are actually very low ([https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-6/pdf/the-rise-and-fall-of-almond-prices-asia-drought-and-consumer-preference.pdf](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-6/pdf/the-rise-and-fall-of-almond-prices-asia-drought-and-consumer-preference.pdf)).

Olive oil is also cheaper than it was in 2017 ([https://ycharts.com/indicators/olive\_oil\_price](https://ycharts.com/indicators/olive_oil_price)).

If you're paying $85 for a cake and it's not from the fucking Cake Boss, you're overpaying.

Zero inflation doesn't mean everything stays the same price, things become more and less relatively expensive over time. That's also why the CPI formula changes from time to time. In the past, lobster was considered crap food for poor people, now it's $40/lb in high-end restaurants. That's not inflation either."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">I know it's popular to shit on on arts degree recipients, but https://hbr.org/2019/09/yes-employers-do-value-liberal-arts-degrees

Let's take a step back and think about what I'm saying. 

* Am I saying that Liberal Arts Degrees are inherently deficient? No.

* Am I saying that Liberal Arts Degrees aren't at all preparing their students for a professional career? Not entirely. 

* Am I saying that increases in higher education costs are lowering the economic utility of a liberal arts education? Yes.

* Am I saying that the fact that an ever growing proportion of America's youth are going to college and the largest majority of those degree recipients entering the job market are liberal arts degrees which is transitively lowering their economic utility via supply and demand? Yes. 

Personally, I have a liberal arts degree. I'm not shitting on them, I'm just acknowledging that their academic standards are looser (by virtue) and that both the cost and ubiquity of their attainment are making them an ever poorer financial investment when compared to hard science based programs. 

Is this an issue in and of itself? Yes. 

Particularly when a college education was as a class based barrier up until the mid 20th century. 

Keeping that in mind, I read the opinion piece you sighted from the HBR. The writer is the president of the AACU and primarily cites this study from [2018](https://www.aacu.org/sites/default/files/files/LEAP/2018EmployerResearchReport.pdf). 

Looking at the data;

1. The study she cites are not specific to liberal arts degrees.

2.  She cites that ['More than six in 10 executives and hiring managers express confidence in colleges and universities.'](https://www.aacu.org/sites/default/files/files/LEAP/2018EmployerResearchReport.pdf) This is a great finding but ignores the broader implication of hiring selectivity. AKA it's a buyers market and only the top 25th percentile of degree holding candidates are hired. Their own study reports that  '25% or more of their new hires hold either an associate‚Äôs degree from a two-year college or a bachelor‚Äôs degree from a four-year college.' Compare this against 4-year degree educational attainment rates of nearly [40% of adults 25 to 34 in 2015.](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p20-578.pdf) IE: A share of GME has significant inherent value, but when you buy at the top of the bubble and buy in the euphoria, you're gonna get left holding the bag when the inevitable crash comes. 

I could go on, but in the end the reality is simple. College is too expensive, money for a degree is too easy to get, and the looser standards in liberal arts programs are flooding the market with degree holders and diffusing their value economically. Main street is seeing this and this is why there is a polling gap between them and corporate america.

Is this an attack on the intrinsic value of a liberal arts education? No. 

But main street buying decisions, rooted in old dogma that any degree means upward mobility, is finally being realized by the public as no longer valid because a college education is too expensive and doesn't equal an automatic ticket to the middle class.

Thanks for playing."

The CPI is still a critical metric, and it should be the one that the Fed uses to determine when to raise rates, or take other action to control prices.  This is because no other metric as directly measures the pain and suffering of our poorest, and a decrease in their buying power should be met with a direct response from the Fed.

It‚Äôs just that everyone assumes that the CPI will be driven by M2, even despite the last 30 years as evidence that relationship no longer exists.

You hear this again and again and again, from analysts and pundits who are either selling FUD or are truly ignorant of the macroeconomic lay of the land."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, that is just how things work.

It's how the human mind works. It's like how the eye evolved. At first one only had ""one pixel"" to see. One could only see intensity changes. Then more pixels were added and one could make out gradients and blobs. Over time the eye evolved billions of pixels and we can make out the finest changes. That progression is evolution and it happens in ALL things. Same with humans intelligence. Some humans are behind the times. They have poor genetics or boor upbringing so their ""eye"" is lower resolution. It's not their fault. Just life.

But we are all limited. The ""real eye"" has infinite number of ""pixels"". No human is like that. It's just that some humans are better than other humans and like to act superior(and they may be in some ways but not in all ways).

Almost all social constructive knowledge is social. That is, the reason why some people under deeper about how the economy works and how the collective psychopathy works to undermine humanity is only due to their knowledge about such things. People that don't have such knowledge can only see the ""blob"". The reason why is precisely because they don't have the knowledge. If you give them the knowledge their ""blob"" becomes more well defined. These ""ignorant"" people should not be blamed or punished but enlightened just as you have been. The more we enlighten each other the more intelligent we get as individuals which feed back in to the whole."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not defending Peter schiff, I've honestly not heard that much about him. I'm only saying that the bubble still exists. With how much money was printed during covid it should accelerate the bubble popping but like the Keynes quote, could be a couple months or a couple decades. 

My best guess as to what will pop it is either societal unrest from severe income inequality caused by the private banks hyperinflating the assets in the first place or automation removing the wages needed for these decades long mortgages to function thus popping the bubble without another means of increasing wages to keep paying the debt. 

UBI could keep the system of debt going longer but if the bubble keeps growing faster than actual economic growth (not the growth of debt), its not going to be deleveraging the bubble nor truly fixing the income inequality caused via this hyperinflating of assets. So I don't hold out much hopes of stopping catastrophic global market failure at some point in the relatively near future.

Edit: also as far as I can tell the billion prices project concerns consumer goods, which is not where it seems from what I can tell the inflation is currently hiding, which is assets."

12 months ago is when the price war took place, driving down gas prices, so of course your prices are going to be higher than a year ago when they were suppressed by SA and Russia. 

Outside of that huge dip in price, prices are basically the same as they were 2 years ago in the upstate SC area. So I was incorrect that they‚Äôve gone down between now and 2 years ago, but they lowered by a lot leading up to the 2020 dip and are still fairly low.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chili Powder is actually 2 different things and you need to know what you are buying.

The first version is seasoning for ""Chili"" the stew that traditionally has beans/meat etc. It's going to be a variety of spices.

But if you are looking to add heat to a dish and the recipe calls for Chili powder what they really mean is some form of ground chili pepper powder, commonly cayenne powder.

Both can be labelled as ""Chili Powder"" but you have to know which is which. If you can find it labelled as ground cayenne you may be better off buying that if you are looking to add heat. I think the confusion comes from most international recipes that come from countries that don't have ""Chili"" the stew that is common in America so the term Chili Powder is less ambiguous in other countries."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"UBI is only universal if it involves no administration other than ensuring its only given to citizens, that's basically the only administration roadblock that a government faces to implement it.

It's legitimately easier to implement than unemployment, housing assistance and the like because its all done in one bulk payment, the general idea is to replace the welfare state with it, as welfare only acts as a trap anyways, if you only make as much when you work as when you don't there's no incentive to work relatively speaking. 

Automation is also predicted to decimate jobs over the next few decades, you can't fund unemployment insurance via taxation of employers other than introducing VAT on goods anyway. If there's nowhere near enough jobs for billions of people, there's a reason tech company's have billions of investment into AI, it consolidates markets into monopolies for whatever company owns the AI as they have next to no labour costs where ever it's implemented completely.

If the main issue you have is you can't trust the administration of government, UBI is a plus compared to current systems that are more open to corruption because more people are involved in the administration of the program

I think Yang makes the best overall explanation of why UBI is the main route forward if you don't want entire towns and cities to essentially break down from extreme efficiency of automation.

The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) is in an excellent position to directly benefit from President Biden's American Jobs Plan that was announced on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, PA. The proposed plan targets over $1.4 trillion for direct investments into physical infrastructure including transportation, schools, hospitals, and buildings as well as for energy, water, and digital infrastructure. The PAVE ETF holds many of the companies that will provide the materials, tools, services, and components required for this infrastructure build-out and should handsomely benefit from it.

INVESTMENT RATIONALE

President Biden presented the American Jobs Plan (part of his ""build back better"" initiative) on Wednesday in Pittsburgh and the White House published a FACT SHEET on its website. In a nutshell, a broad summary of the infrastructure initiatives in the American Jobs Plan is shown below:

PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE:

- Transportation infrastructure (621B)
- Buildings, schools and hospitals (250+B)
- Infrastructure resilience (50B)

ENERGY, WATER AND DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE

- Cleantech, clean energy, and related infra (300+B)
- Water Utilities (111B)
- Digital infrastructure (100b)

In total, the aggregate spending targeted directly at these infrastructure projects is over $1.4 trillion. The investment thesis here is simple: find an infrastructure fund that can benefit directly from those investment dollars.

Let's take a look at the PAVE ETF and see what its prospects are going forward.

TOP HOLDINGS

The PAVE Infrastructure Development ETF's Top-10 holdings can be found on Global X ETF website and equate to roughly 30% of what I would characterize as a moderately concentrated portfolio that holds a total of 101 companies.

PAVE has ~$2.3 billion in assets, so even a 3.2% weight of #1 holding Deere (DE) results in a $80.5 million stake. Many investors would consider Deere and odd choice for an infrastructure ETF considering it is generally regarded as focused solely on agriculture. However, DE operates in three segments - one of which is its Construction & Forestry Segment. This segment manufactures machines for earth moving, road building, graders, excavators, material handling, crushers and screeners, and asphalt pavers. DE is up 178% over the past year yet has an estimated forward P/E of only 23.3x.

The #2 holding with a 3.0% weight is motion control systems specialist Parker-Hannifin Corp. (PH), which operates a Diversified Industrial segment that provides sealing, shielding, vibration, and thermal solutions as well as filters, noise abatement, and contaminate removal systems for water, air, fuel, oil, and other liquids. PH is also up 170%+ over the past year, has a forward P/E=22.4x, and yields 1.1%.

The Eaton Corp. (ETN) is the #3 holding and has 3.0% weight within the portfolio. Eaton pays a $3.04 annual dividend, yields 2.2%, and has a forward P/E=24.9x. The company is heavily involved in the power management sector and likely will provide many of the electrical components and assemblies needed to build out the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure detailed in the American Jobs Plan's investments into Clean Tech and Clean Energy.

The #4, #5, and #10 holdings are railroad companies Norfolk Southern (NSC), Kansas City Southern (KSU), and CSX Corp. (CSX). Along with #12 holding Union Pacific (UNP), these four holdings alone equate to ~11.5% of the entire portfolio. Obviously, this ETF is betting that these rail freight providers will be hauling much of the gravel, rock, asphalt, lumber, steel, and products and assemblies that will be needed to build out the infrastructure of roads, bridges, buildings, and energy and water systems as detailed in the AJP. These railroads will also benefit from ""opening up"" and a generally stronger economy

Some of that has been fueled by the excellent progress the Biden administration and big-pharma when it comes to the vaccine rollout and, as a result, from general expectations that the U.S. economy is opening up fast and will see very strong growth in the 2H of the year. Meantime, Canadian Pacific (CP) recently offered to buy KSU for $25 billion, which has added some ""merger mania"" to the sector.

Surprisingly, the fund does not hold Caterpillar (CAT). CAT is generally thought to be one of the main beneficiaries of an infrastructure bill. But considering that stock has doubled over the past year, perhaps the management team feels it is overvalued. But with a forward P/E=28.3x and a 1.8% yield, CAT seems to be an odd omission in my opinion.

Looking through the rest of the portfolio (see the full list of holdings here), we find many of the companies that sell the raw materials (steel, aluminum, copper, lumber, asphalt, filters, etc.) needed to for as the basic building blocks for transportation, electrical, utility, and water infrastructure.

PERFORMANCE

PAVE ETF wins by a considerable margin over IFRA on a NAV basis and neither ETF pays that much in the way of income (0.64% and 1.4%, respectively). PAVE is ~9x the size of IFRA, which has ~$250 million in AUM.

Over a shorter time-frame that encompasses the ""year-of-covid-19"" and the period when discussions about an infrastructure bill to get Americans back to work with good-paying jobs got serious, PAVE has also out-performed the IFRA ETF by a significant margin.

FUND BASICS

These metrics all come from the Global X PAVE ETF Webpage:

Expense Ratio: 0.47%
AUM: $2.3 billion
P/E Ratio: 32.2x
Forward P/E Ratio: 21.9x
Price-to-Book: 3.6x
30-day SEC-yield: 0.64%
Roughly 87% of the fund is invested in the Industrials and Materials sectors.

RISKS

Considering the strong rally the PAVE ETF has had over the past year in anticipation of the infrastructure bill, much has already been built into the price. That said, note the fund is not over-weight any high-flying clean-energy names and, despite the growth of some of these stocks, many still sell at very reasonable valuation levels - see the forward P/E's of some of the top holding discussed earlier.

The biggest risk is getting a substantial the American Jobs Plan through Congress. It should get through the Democratically controlled House in roughly the same shape as presented. As we learned with the American Rescue Plan, despite the objections of some of the more progressive members of the Democratic Party, they have shown some level of pragmatism in that they know if the legislation doesn't get through the very narrowly controlled Senate, it won't matter what they pass in the House. Much is likely to depend on what Senator Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia) decides he will support as if history is any indication, the AJP will get zero Republicans votes, so the Democrats must get all 50-votes so that Vice President Harris can break the tie.

I believe the Democrats will push the legislation through because a recent poll by Navigator recently found broad bi-partisan support (over 80%) for an infrastructure bill by American voters.

TLDR: Summary & Conclusion

For those investors that don't typically invest in the infrastructure sector (myself included) but want to have some exposure to where their tax dollars are going in the American Jobs Plan, the PAVE ETF seems like an excellent choice. The portfolio is full of solidly profitable companies that are reasonably valued and in an excellent position to benefit from the build-out of U.S. infrastructure. PAVE is a BUY."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Only a tiny bit of this bill will end up in actual physical infrastructure investment
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this post is really deceptive.

Like, take a look at the $621b being spent on ""transportation infrastructure.""  You think ""Bridges!  Trains!  Roads!""  And you're not entirely wrong.  But $174b of it is electric vehicles.  Another $85b is basically increased subsidies for busses and other public transport.  There's a lot of stuff in this bill that is not big machines, raw materials, and construction workers.

And even when you take the categories you listed at face value, there's a mismatch.  $100b in ""digital infrastructure?"" Cant wait to see what slice John Deere gets out of that pie, lol.

I think ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" is the play here.  It's time to take profits and sell whatever shares you've got of NUE/CLF/X.  This bill was disappointing for those of us hoping for a gigantic surge in steel and whatnot."

2021-04-05 00:19:22,wallstreetbets,"$PSFE (Paysafe) the most undervalued fintech play on the market. Popular analyst Steve Grasso has been calling for it to triple. Using the lower end of  Paysafe‚Äôs forecasted EBITDA ($500M), $1.5B revenue, an EV adjusted for  $1.8B debt, and applying the post-merger pro forma 720M outstanding  shares, here are Paysafe‚Äôs potential share prices based solely on sector  peer **EV/EBITDA ratios:**

Note: Most of these companies have negative earnings and smaller margins than Paysafe.

I‚Äôm  not suggesting it‚Äôs worth this much, but for reference, averaging the  above multiples would put BFT/Paysafe‚Äôs share price at $135.98

More realistically, taking the average from the lowest four puts the share price at $50.75.

Paysafe is the number 1 digital wallet in Igaming and is used by the top sports gambling company Draftkings. As all SPACs do now, it sold off big today with the ticker change so there has never been a better time to buy than now! 

Note : I‚Äôm long PSFE with 3,350 shares @15.47

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad that we can finally post/comment about Paysafe now
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bill Foley, to be Paysafe‚Äôs Chairman of the Board, says Paysafe may be his ‚Äúbest investment ever.‚Äù

In just the last five years, through proven M&A expertise, Foley and his team grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B) and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). 

Foley also drove value creation in Fidelity National Information Services 36.4X ($2.5Billion to over $91Billion). He says, ‚ÄúThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.‚Äù

Of Paysafe, Foley said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fortress. It‚Äôs got a moat.‚Äù And it ‚Äúmay be his best investment ever.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it‚Äôs our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We‚Äôre focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we‚Äôve got a wide landscape we can attack. It‚Äôs pretty exciting.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that‚Äôs headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That‚Äôs why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.‚Äù"

Also they have a lot of competition so it can be a rather risky play. I don't see much upside since they are already priced at P/S 7 vs SQ and PYPL at 11 and 13.5 with a lot more growth ahead."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,SoFi‚Äôs merger should go through very soon and is similarly undervalued IMO.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Arbitrage. Once share price is above $18, just subtract $11.50 for fair value of warrants.  Under $18 warrants value is roughly 1/3 of common shares."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hugggggge difference between Nikola and a company owned by Blackstone and CVC. Their reputation is on the line with their LPs and the institutional investors that bought into the PIPE.

With SPACs, the reputation and history of the teams behind the transactions is key. I wouldn't touch something done by Michael Klein for example (despite CCIV ending up being a 3x'er from NAV) because he has a history of screwing over his SPAC investors. (Side note: Some would argue the CCIV leak on valuation and retrade fits the bill on him doing it again, but not 100% sold on that given it ultimately gave Lucid more negotiation leverage. That being said, it was a sketchy situation all around and they seem to follow him.)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Been following this since December and it's the only bear case I've heard so far.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"First you're criticizing, saying they don't trade on EBITDA, then your saying they do?  In any case, I've looked more closely at EV / EBITDA, EV / Revenue and EV / Free cash flow multiples of sector peers, including PayPal, Nuvei, Repay, Shift 4, Adyen, Square, Affirm, Stripe, Chime and a few others, using cross-referenced data from Nasdaq, WSJ, Morningstar, Macrotrends, Yahoo Finance. Yes, I've done all the math with the available published data.  The conservative average of those three multiples puts Paysafe‚Äôs post-merger pro forma share value at around $46.52:

&#x200B;

Paysafe‚Äôs share price using the average multiples from the full list of sector peers:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&#x200B;

More realistic share prices, after eliminating all outliers with very high multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Note: Unlike Paysafe, nearly half of these publicly traded fintechs still do not report positive cash flow. Also, these multiples reflect a collective 27% pull back from recent highs so interest rate risks have been somewhat factored in.

Also, Paysafe's CFO noted that their conservative 11% growth projection is tied to the general fintech market at large. They have deliberately excluded both M&A plans that are apparently already underway and US iGaming growth that may potentially grow 10x or more over the next 5 years. Further, the above comps include fintechs with slower or similar growth while still commanding much higher multiples. For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth and GPN's growth projection is on par with Paysafe's."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the way. Check the cashless conversion chart.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,arbitrage? do you mean leverage? I don't see an arbitrage play.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the lockup for Blackstone and CVC only.  Not a concern in my opinion.  Just a few days ago, Eli  Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone said: ‚ÄúWe believe  Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to  remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a  public company.‚Äù   Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing  directors on Paysafe‚Äôs Board. Bill Foley recently said, ‚ÄúThey rolled a significant  amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn‚Äôt  take all their money off the table‚Ä¶ All of these things put together  really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the  PIPE and then support the stock.‚Äù

PIPE lockup in 170 days (roughly 6 months)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great point, bill foley seems to have a great track record which is reason for confidence in PSFE"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've got 36 at 13..something. 
  
Definitely adding to my position throughout 2021."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work in TMT and tech companies don‚Äôt trade on EBITDA unless they are past the growth phase. Secondly, I‚Äôm not sure I would really look at the BNPL (affirm) players, as they trade in their own bracket. There is a difference between payments and BNPL, and it would be best to divide those worlds. EBITDA and FCF are meaningless, the whole reason to buy a tech company is for their growth, and a growing tech company spends their earnings to grow, meaning profitability is irrelevant."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holding warrants provides leverage to own more shares later. ""Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same asset in  different markets in order to profit from tiny differences in the  asset's listed price. It exploits short-lived variations in the price of  identical or similar financial instruments in different markets or in  different forms."""
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for clearing this up, that‚Äôs even better!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have to respectfully disagree. This is not simply a growth play.  This is also a value play and it is undervalued by just about every reasonable metric. Paysafe is a diversified payments platform with massive market share in a space that is notorious for ""sticky customers"".  Their unique risk management and regulatory expertise gives them a moat against competitors.  Because the new Board of Directors, along with Bill Foley, is geared precisely towards inorganic synergistic growth through M&A, their free cash flow means a lot.  There is a lot more to this story."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know what arbitrage is, but didn't get how it applied here.

or do you mean picking up a warrant for less than fmv of the underlying?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll look at it more and let you know my thoughts.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"At current levels, warrants are worth roughly 1/3 of common shares. As commons go higher, you can trade warrants for more shares as relative value of warrants increases to 0.361 per share via cashless conversion. When commons trade above $18 then cash conversion ($11.50) comes into play offering further leverage to buy more shares.  It's really just a matter of how you look at it.  There are many ways to trade between the two or simply hold.  I hold a lot of warrants and will keep them for as long as possible.  I intend to hold commons shares for at least a couple years."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm looking at their investor deck, and their revenue growth is abysmal? You‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs a value play but your comps are all hyper growth stocks? Why?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because those are the primary fintechs in the same space. Some of which have slower growth, smaller margins or no profit at all while still commanding higher multiples. Unlike most fintechs Paysafe has a big exposure in live sporting events and brick and mortar retail which was completely shut down in 2020 due to Covid.  In a call with analysts they discussed their decision to keep revenue growth projections in line with the fintech market at large which is 11%.  They are deliberately leaving their M&A plans out of their projections as well as their expected growth in US igaming.  

This is in keeping with Chairman of the Board Bill Foley's style which has been described as under promise and over deliver.  Many are betting on the growth of this company based on Foley's proven track record.  In just the last five years, Foley and his team grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B) and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew Fidelity National Information Services 36.4X ($2.5Billion to over $91Billion). Foley recently said, ‚ÄúThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.‚Äù"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have an actual spreadsheet with the comps and metrics? I‚Äôd love to see what you mean by other growing more slowly. 11% is about as slow as it gets.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do have a spreadsheet compiling all the data but it is far too confusing for others because I was looking at so many different metrics.  Like I said, it's all based on published data from the sites I mentioned, which are admittedly prone to error.  A real anomaly is Shift4 which apparently reported only 4% y-o-y growth but analysts seem to think it should deserve exceedingly high multiples. Ultimately, I think Paysafe's value will be tied to their M&A execution combined with the expansion of US iGaming which they indicate will be 10X over the next 4 years."

> Following a series of newspaper articles declaring him the ""Great Bear of Wall Street"", he was blamed for the crash by the public and received death threats, leading him to hire an armed bodyguard.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This might sound crazy, but I actually think the best way to short the US Dollar is to buy SPY leaps.

SPY is mainly made up of massive multinational corps with offices and customers across the world. If the USD shits the bed because of inflation, the revenue of these corporations (in real terms) won't really change that much. Since the underlying value of SPY doesn't change, its value rockets up in an inversely proportional way to the devaluation of the USD.

If the USD has 4% annual inflation over the next 3 years, SPY goes to $450 (even before we consider any ""natural growth"" of these companies). If things get **really** spicy and we see the 7% inflation we had in the 1980s, then we see SPY $490 in 3 years just from inflation alone.

Assuming that the real value of SPY continues to grow at 8% per year, and if we assume a 4% inflation over the next 3 years, then we see SPY $562 in Dec 2023.

Currently Dec 2023 SPY leaps are goin for about $11. That's a 6x in 3 years.

Not shabby."

The CDC updated its website on Friday to reflect the latest scientific evidence, writing that ""people who are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized vaccine can travel safely within the United States.""

Most countries will start doing this as America was one of the worse hit, so if American's are doing this than others will follow and itll be a domino effect.

When covid hit, who made the most money? grocery stores, im sure you all remember when you went to the grocery store and couldn't even find toliet paper or a bag of rice, the same effect is going to take place with airlines because people are dying for a break and a holiday so we will see literally ""sold out"" airline schedules for the day/week .

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That dip on gme...
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was just messing around with some basic compound interest calculations, and **that shit is fucking CRAZY.**

On Feb 2, I cashed out about $4M of gains from GME. After paying taxes, buying some toys and setting money aside for a house, I had $1.8M left over to put into boomer shit (mutual funds, mainly). This is in addition to the $700k or so of boomer shit I already had.

I'm in my mid 30s now, and the mutual funds give a fairly reliable 9% annual ROI (if dividends are reinvested, which I do). I intend to retire between 60 and 65, so there should be $28M in there by then. When I retire, I'll start a 2% drawdown per year, but leave it in stocks.

If there's some crazy shit by then where I can transfer my consciousness into a robot and effectively achieve immortality, I can just leave shit be forever. Nice thing is at age 65, dementia hasn't really kicked in yet, so my consciousness should still be good to go! Compounding at 9% perpetually, I can upgrade to the newest cyborg every few years and pay for whatever ""backup plans"" exist to make sure that I can't really die to anything.

After 350 years of leaving this money in stocks at a 9% annual ROI, I'll have $3.1 x 10^(19). I think this is **$31 Quintillion**, which is roughly 169 million times more than what Jeff Bezos currently has. Even assuming a 2% annual inflation, it still clocks in at 165 thousand times what Bezos is rocking.

So... who's going to build me that robot?"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The two cliches in action, you'd be trying to time the market, and the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it goes up 15% over the next 6 months before dropping 30% over the next 3 months you might break even.

Like, you're fighting a trend, from long term to short term, all going up, that trend will just wear away at your position so even if you're right but just early, you might lose money.

Usually when you're a contrarian it pays to just dive into momentum when it actually starts bucking the trend and dropping, the amount of money you lose being a day late is usually far less than the money you lose being months early"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">What's wrong with this reasoning?

The fact that stocks go up more than they go down. If Spy goes up 20% and then falls 15% in a correction a few months later, you still lose money. 

You could also gain money, but that is obviously not guaranteed."

CCL needs some good news from CDC but might be last chance to get on a discount for a while
And RIDE for some legal issues, but if they do good in the San Felipe Baja race on 4/17 you‚Äôll double your money. 

Other than that I can‚Äôt help you! Your best bet would to be to put it in a tax protected account and invest it into index funds, but you wouldn‚Äôt be here if you wanted to do pussy shit like that! Check them out though
Or listen to people way smarter than me, I was too dumb to even know RIDE was under investigation when I bought in. I‚Äôm just like, ‚Äúoh cool truck! Wait, they were just in the $30s and now I can get them for 15$??i want in‚Äù. But I think I got lucky and am actually gonna be ok. Averaged down to 13.89 with 150 shares. If they kill it in this desert race it def will bounce right back up. 

Ccl is safer though in my opinion, but the ceiling is higher with ride. But sadly, The floor is lower too"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,if it was me (not a financial advisor) i‚Äôm slamming PENN calls $112-115

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Me and my 344 shares cannot WAIT for tomorrow
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,1000 percent is crazy high but hypothetically if it did I would sell my handful of shares wait for it to dip again and buy 2 handfuls of shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,YESS. BRING ME THE TENDIES
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs Tesla hitting by December?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,LETS FUCKING GO $TSLA TO $1k EOD!!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This confirms my bias. Moon it is. Thanks
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been on the GME mission but I always keep an eye on TSLA, I haven't been keeping up with any information regarding the stock but once GME mooned I had planned to invest some tendies back into the ""home"" stock. Is there a DD that I can read that'll explain why Monday is so significant?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs happening Monday? I ate too many crayons this weekend. The toxic kind.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla stock price could hit $4000 this year already! üòâ *No financial advice*
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like the old WSB is back. Summer time is here. Who is going buy a TESLA this year?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell the news confirmed
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I love this movie
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would car delivery numbers keep pushing TSLA up? The market cap is already 5√ó what this company is ever going to be worth based on automotive alone. Apple's Tesla battery purchase is honestly probably more significant.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes..... imagine thinking this news justifies Tesla at anything above 200 a share
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If you see Tesla dip under 650 that's your que to sell everything and buy fds.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,because it confirms the growth trajectory.

Edit: Actually just realised it says it's exclusive renderings but doesn't give a source. Maybe take it with a grain of salt as to whether it's 100% a confirmed design. I'm a little TOO retarded sometimes.

Yeah upon closer inspection the fucking journo might have mugged me with their wording. Although presented as actual news they have carefully avoided saying 'official'. My bad."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Confirms what growth trajectory? The one inferred by the current market cap? Because based on automotive sales at even slightly improved margins, growth would have to continue at this rate for multiple years to justify even half the current cap. The market is building in huge growth in auto sales and much higher margin services Tesla doesn't even offer yet."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,A reasonable price. Right now it‚Äôs ludicrous. Tesla will more than likely fall off a cliff at some point and people are gonna get very hurt financially. Fundamentals are all you need to look at. I hope it survives tho. I like Tesla cars

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that you think 2013 Amazon is in anyway comparable to Tesla says more about yourself then you think it might about me regardless of where the downvotes stand

found the person who thought tesla is an insurance business"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How does a car sales volume metric confirm the growth trajectory of other services that are either indirectly related or don't exist yet? That's like saying Facebook ad sales confirm the growth trajectory of their VR business.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right. That is what I mean.

When the stock split was announced it was something like $1300 or so. 
So it ran all the way up to ~$2500 by the time it split."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only use money on options that I am willing to lose 100% of. 95% is in a long term account, with 75% Tesla (extremely diversified, ik.) after this week tho my options could go up so much that my gambling account could be the same as my long term, LOL."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No response to how much profit Tesla makes off its insurance business......
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Never thought amazon sold books lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol what? I never said that I'm just asking whats the profit on Tesla's other businesses like its insurance since its doesn't only sell cars similar to how op implied apple doesn't only sell phones
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm like 100% sure MU was before AMD but the real WSB magic started with AMD. I remember back in 2016s when some retard lost 2k on Disney. That was like a huge thing. Now we do millions
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"....you're an idiot. 

More cars = more FSD. FSD has a take rate. do you know what a take rate is? And insurance. Tesla insurance + FSD + app purchases take rates for each car produced."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,1Trillion ez
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,TSLA sells insurance?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Until ""FSD"" actually facilitates robotaxis, it is a feature driving up margins on auto sales, not an independent service. If every Tesla purchased next year were equipped with FSD and insured by Tesla, how many cars would they have to sell to see net income of >$10B/qtr?

It's also really funny that you left out the majority of the examples in your previous response because they aren't directly related to this metric, as I said.

The popular justification for Tesla's multiple is from armchair programmers watching FSD YouTube videos and pricing in complete dominance of a market that, as of this moment, has one active, revenue-generating player, which isn't Tesla."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats currently a metric factored into their current valuation right now yes although different analyst have their own viewpoints on how big it is. Not sure why thats not a valid question to ask if someone thinks Tesla isn‚Äôt overvalued but hey why ask questions just buy buy buy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Prolly 2M cars per quarter assuming net income of $5k per car. Tesla will get there by 2025-2026. If Tesla has a Robotaxi Network deployed before 2025, then we'll get there a lot sooner.  

Also, theres only one revenue generating player that isnt Tesla? Are you sure? Because I'm pretty sure Tesla has a $10k FSD package when you buy. [FSD Subscription is coming this quarter as well](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1366514764868775936)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla would have to increase their margins by about 50% and their global market share by more than 10√ó to hit those numbers. I'm not saying that's not possible, I'm saying the current multiple assumes that's what is likely... which is **quite** optimistic."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt worry supposedly despite being behind waymo and argo ai Tesla will not just surpass them but also have a full Robo taxi flat in what 4 years? Lol

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúWe need revenue, should we raise taxes?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, let‚Äôs instead take money from people with gambling addictions‚Äù. Love America."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The amount of money this state is poised to make from fines alone will be in the billions.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,buy penn and dk with your tendies
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm upvoting you! I hold and it stinks watching the world still spinning lol.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I told myself when the NBA restarted last year that I would NEVER touch my sports book stonks until they buy me a house. Gambling stocks literally can't go tits up. I am their target demographic and everyone I know gambles 3-4x a week. So even when I lose sports bets, I still win."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah its totally gonna be beneficial for the state, just the timing is a little suss 

Did he really have to wait for this exact moment, especially since he's up for reelection next year. Nonetheless he's politically ruined, we never know he might give Wall Street legal cocaine to try to win over support"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They seem pretty small. How will they fare against larger competitors like DKNG?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro it‚Äôs a pog stonk what are you on about??
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I sold at the top on both anyway. Didn't miss out on anything yet."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Better not tell you now
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Politics is an ugly business, no matter which side of the aisle they're on. It's full of pimps and hoes. It does seem like his career is ruined. If that's the case I hope he goes for ""broke"" and actually does things that are best for the state, whether the align with his parties agenda or not. Fuck, if he effectively pulled off such a feat and was actually remorseful and went to some sort of ""group therapy"" type deal for people who engage in sexual harassment he could potentially run as an independent for something and actually get elected. Now that would be something...I know, it's fun believing that fairytales come true üòÇ"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Well if any time was the time to do his fucken job it oughtta be now
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are more efficient, if lesser known than DKNG. That‚Äôs the RSI long play in a nutshell. They run a profitable business, while also have deep tentacles into the online casino business (i.e. non-sports wagering online games such as poker, slots, etc.). RSI makes the play that the online gamblers that play those games have a much higher lifetime value than a sports gambler. I‚Äôm very interested in RSI. Long both RSI and PENN (with the hope that PENN acquires RSI in 2022)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Could you explain why?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I could totally see Penn purchasing or merging with RSI. Would give them an all around almost monopoly. Def the biggest piece of pie.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are in the process of rolling out sports betting that's embedded within the streaming service experience. I think Q4 of this year. Fubo is being valuated based on being a streaming service. Add in an additional revenue stream, the valuation becomes incredibly cheap."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome cuz my $50/sh bags are stupidly heavy
2021-04-04 22:09:31,wallstreetbets,"In honor of one year with WSB, I present to you my biggest gain ($450-$30k in two weeks) Cheers to another rollercoaster year! I love you guys!! And I like the stock!!! "
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool. I make just under that in an entire year. I'm happy for you though.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus Christ ... i kinda hates this guy. 

Well done :)

Edit: She seems humble and polite, my rage is unaffected..."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you! Now turn that $30k into $500k üòé

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm just trying to get my $250 to $1000.

I'm at $603 right now, so it will definitely get there. I want my real-time quotes, etrade!!!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is your post so similar to another just recently posted on WSB?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,where is the 450k. npnt
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure do wish I knew WTF I was looking at? Dunno, but going to buy some more GME brb"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone else read this as 450k to 30k and thought it was sarcasm? Congrats bro! Welcome to retard nation, where everyone has a house with property taxes out the ass and has preordered 5 Cybertrucks."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Now You keep that gain
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you and congrats
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you better have a small dick or something"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't quite understand options though they have been seemingly the most profitable.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you sell calls
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mjenes/checks_folks_interesting_find_some_traders_have/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So this is bought on margin but what‚Äôs the contracts portion? Can someone link me to a good video explaining contracts pls
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they say no, ask them not even 10?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"casual at stock trading, can someone tl;dr if they don‚Äôt have time or if you do, provide a detailed explanation on this? i‚Äôm not understanding the steps or what calls/contracts are"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,don't forget to separate a share for uncle Sam.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Results as in if i gain money or lose no one cares about my thoughts on what i learn lol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're a god! My current plan:

I own 100 shares and I'm selling weekly calls to generate around $1500. Usually around $220c. Then I'm buying $1500 in weekly $140 puts with that profit. So far the price has not gotten high enough to get assigned on my calls but if that happens then I'll just have to buy a dip and start again."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats paperhands.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop doing margins and stop doing options. Not a financial advisor but holding is the only true way to win
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Im confused.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Put some in XDN big bro
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,save 15k for taxes
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So what‚Äôs next? I want in
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Confuckyoulations!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What does the price here mean? Wasn‚Äôt the price of the stock at this time 40$ ? What does in the money mean? There‚Äôs a time frame where you can take your profits or?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought we were holding? Is it time to sell?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope u buy some bags of xdn and post and let's take it to moon big boss 100x easy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Go fuck yourself
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow I thought it said 450k to 30k. I was excited for a second. I think I‚Äôm addicted to loss porn
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,$450 with margin. Legend.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lucky you you got options fidelity wont let me
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yew
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty good.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You must adopt at least one gorilla my man.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Pls teach meüòÇüòÇ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm confused at what time you sold.  

I had 2/19 110c when the stock was at $89 on 1/25, and I sold one of them for $27,500.  Wouldn‚Äôt a 40C have been worth way more than $30,400?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So you bought and then sold the contracts right? You didn't actually buy the shares?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Too many letters and numbers in those pictures... can't read it
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Man playing with fire on margins holy shit I can feel that tax rate. Nevertheless congratulation!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's awesome, ohh and happy cake day OP!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Sus he sold....
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So when is the next hike and who‚Äôs ball sack do you need to tickle to find out where to put your stake üçæüöÄü•∏
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"As an option noob, can you explain exactly what you did here/what I'm looking at? Still learning about puts/calls, ITM/OTM, etc."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good for you buddy
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Cheers mate
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I need to learn about options!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo... go man go 
Happy Anniversary"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So did she buy 1 options contract equaling 100 stocks or 10 options contracts equaling 1000 stocks? Looks like the ladder of 10 options contracts. And then she actually exercised them and bought on margin. Terrifying and awesome. Happy for you! This is some food for thought!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why are people saying this is good, he sold ffs. Gme is not about the gains"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, took me a minute too."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too! Lmao
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. I re read it a few times to make sure op didn't tag gain by mistake
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah YOLO'ing your money into options is pretty hit or miss. A lot of missing, so it's not recommended. But OP and all the other retards who bought up cheap OTM calls early was just the jackpot scenario you wish for."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The only correct response
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely quite a few of those üòÖ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks... I think? :)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Working on it!!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I use Fidelity
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost it was around $340
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,To be Frank I got really lucky
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,An option is x100 so the call cost me $455
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Also I bought kinda early
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you I really did. I am very grateful
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm so glad :)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,üíØ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I had another call that I sold too early. I am definitely okay with the profit on this one!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you and yes I use fidelity
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,üöÄüöÄüöÄ
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow! Food for thought right there!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Was reminiscing on my one whole year with WSB today :)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks very much! üòä
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is 100% the exception
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,The hardest part!!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotta work up that nerve. Also, it‚Äôs easier to not be hated when the stock looks good."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity won‚Äôt let my dumb ass trade options yet. It‚Äôs for the best.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Female OP... it's confusing since Dallas is so obviously a boys name.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,When do they expire?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If you're not a moron buying weekly otm calls you won't lose much (if anything) unless the whole market takes a dump.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I started out with options playing with money I could afford to lose which is why I had such a cheap option here. I‚Äôve learned to buy further time expirations as well
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Spoiler alert. 


She does"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, I mean if you don‚Äôt mind losing your shares, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. You‚Äôre making profit. Nice"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Because this sub was built and is about options not damn shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check out InTheMoney on YouTube. Video on options. It‚Äôs long, but by the end you will be ready to start thinking about being ready to start trading options"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh gawd you must be an ‚Äúape‚Äù. imagine thinking taking profit on massive gains is stupid. There‚Äôs more plays than GME gawd damn let people be.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is true.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah fuck I had a 2200 to 150 for my first option when it crashed on Super MAR10 Day lol.  Not even close in magnitude at all, but I divided and saw that I am, to scale, as retarded. Imma take this as my right of passage"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Well at least I didn‚Äôt lose my house for nothing I guess
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How does one buys a call
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy cakeday show vag
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Not recommended for people who dont know what they‚Äôre doing....
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,There don't seem to be any options on GME in DE (or is it just my trading platform?).
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Aka overthinking/paranoia side effects of weed lmao.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,In that case I don't think I can ever come back
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúI could‚Äôve had it all‚Äù
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm only high when I‚Äôm here
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,corp is the key
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You looking for a bf tho?

Obligatory congrats! 
 and fuck you"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy birthday retard
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm curious, when did you order yours? I ordered mine 15 days ago. They still haven‚Äôt returned my email asking for an ETA."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I can see how that's a mixed bag :)
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you use a strategy or just hit the right stocks during the pandemic?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,üëç
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright. That‚Äôs better. Thank you.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They made that all sound so fucking difficult. Like what are you even trying to learn in the first place
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh thank you, so the best and most safety way is to go on buying 'Long call/put"" then trade them however I want to with the only risk of my initial investment, got it!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I stand corrected, apologies op, way to fucking go still blowing my mind!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha I just like the city and couldn‚Äôt think of a random username ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Went and rolled them out, so 100 days now."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do realise all the gains he made someone will loose, and most likely it is other people from wsb."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the unemployment line
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can confirm.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did this at a smaller scale, but also in reverse. It was my first option. LOL"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It is available on comdirect
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a blessing and a curse
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol actually ya I‚Äôm 100% single right now
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably about two weeks ago also
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I placed mine March 18 and received an email today April 5 that it is being shipped

Also bear in mind I did it the day of release and they probably took preorders before printing the shirts so the supply chain likely will be quicker moving forward"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Please save yourself (and your family) a lot of heartache. Don‚Äôt do options without a plan. Or at least until you understand why theta and delta will murder your ass.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No one needs your research results.  Learning to trade options is very simple.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You got it all mixed up broseph.  OP bought 1 option contract and then sold it back before expiration.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No worries! And thank you!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh boo hoo you seem like a new retard just by the way you‚Äôre talking. WSB is a place for yolos, options, and being retarded. GME is not everything in the market there are way more other plays out there to be made so I‚Äôm not going to hate on a member who made hella nice gains"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This is Wendy‚Äôs
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Keith Gill knew
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,weird. I don't get anything on consors
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Your poor inbox.  A gal with money!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm guessing you're in dallas? Boston ain't farrr
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They must just be swamped with orders. Shirt screen printer go brrr
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright, thank you for the quick lesson, cya on the moon"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, this is Patrick"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you ask them very nicely to give back 20 for free?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,holy shit how do you sleep at night king?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That must hurt badly.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok you win
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha it‚Äôs surprisingly quiet. Most people seem to really just want advice. Only received one sugar mama request so far üòÜüë∏üèº
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Y‚Äôall got anymore of that stimmy money?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That person lost them all within a few days gambling.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Like a baby. He wakes up every two hours crying
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, it never bothered me until like Xmas time. Then realised the tens of millions i basically let go for free, it does suck big time knowing i could be young and retired. It usually hits me when im hating work, or just see a nice apartment online lol. Tbh i am more annoyed at myself that i could have let my mother retire."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is surprising, although maybe the WSB boys are of a higher caliber than I expected.  I want this to be the reason haha."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Update us, what's the inbox looking like?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you send it to me too plz
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey man keep your head up and don't let it haunt you anymore. That sucks but the odds were not in your favor. I think 99% of everyone in your situation would ditch those dumb coins that were worth nothing at the time.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basic investment philosophy - always try to make the best decision that you can <at the time with the information that you had at the time that you made it>.  This reduces second-guessing yourself.  If you get in the habit of second guessing past decisions, you will over-think your trades in the future and miss potential profits.

Also, spending B-coin in the early days were a part of the narrative which got it to where it is today...."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had a fianc√© once, i‚Äôm just filling the hole in my heart with desperate options gambles in hopes that one day i‚Äôll strike it rich and finally vindicate myself. The sad truth is no one will care. :( 
Wsb why you gotta hurt me like this."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol they are NOT impressed with $30k ahahahhahahahahahha
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Surprisingly quiet!! I had no idea this would get to the front page! So cool!

2021-04-04 21:16:44,wallstreetbets,"Here's why VIAC is setting up for a strong rebound **ViacomCBS (VIAC) is down 55% in nearly two weeks and the fundamentals of the company have not changed.**

* VIAC priced an offering at $85 per share, the institutions/hedge-funds who bought at those levels have no choice but to reduce their cost basis at current levels.
* The forced liquidation of Archegos Capital lead to massive VIAC blocks being sold in the market at a discounted price, which aided to the nasty continuous sell-off. There‚Äôs been a drastic decline in volume the past few days which signals that the liquidation phase is near or at its end.
* VIAC‚Äôs bullish momentum came from a few factors: Their new streaming service Paramount+ releasing, ViacomCBS reaching 11-year agreement with the NFL, strong earnings, extremely cheap valuation relative to market, and a company that follows the value/reopening/cyclical trend in a higher yield environment.
* ViacomCBS is not some meme company, it‚Äôs a company with a strong balance sheet that produces real profits.
* Paramount+ growth and success will stem from ViacomCBS‚Äôs brands and their unique model.

Seriously my man?  Are you retarded?

The bet here is not ""Will Viacom go out of business?""  The bet here is ""Would doing a stock buyback right now increase Viacom's chances of going bankrupt?""

If you think there is zero downside to a stock buyback right now, then the people running Viacom, who even you should admit are probably a lot fucking better at running the company than a rando like you, will see your logic and do a stock buyback, right?

And if there are significant downsides to doing a buyback now, as I'm arguing, then they wouldn't do the buyback, right?

So the bet is ""Will Viacom do a buyback right now?""  And you've said it yourself, ""Probably not.""

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely don‚Äôt disagree with this and it‚Äôs probably due to scaling out the massive amount of spend their going to need to do for streaming to compete for subscribers. 

My view was more of what will increase shareholder value now due to a very random one off event (margin call) that caused there stock to plummet 50%.

If the stock was down 10-20% from the share offering price to me there is more long term value using the capital for subscriber growth. 

The fact it dropped 50% from what they sold the share offering for less then 2 weeks ago would create a lot of value for shareholders buying those shares back and still having 1.3b of cash from the offering towards content needs + there cash on hand. 

But yea they have a plan that requires a certain amount of capital so not disagreeing with you there."

Well that's some interesting math you've got there champ!  So you think the chances of them doing a stock buyback within the next... I dunno, month or two lets say, are higher than them ever going bankrupt?

But if a stock buyback doesn't happen in the next couple months, don't the odds on your plan go to zero, but bankruptcy remains non-zero?

> Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm correct but you‚Äôre definitely not.

EDIT:  Last June 15th their stock value was 21.90.  After the flash sale its 44.64, it peaked at over 100, and they sold 3b worth of stock at 85.

What's funny to me is that we have opposite positions and in this case one of us *must* be correct, and even though you don't seem to think you're correct, you think I must be wrong.  How in the hell does that work?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the short-term upside on the stock is overstated.  I think we've probably hit the bottom.

I think the implied volatility in the options pricing is way too high right now.  Therefore I am not going to be touching any call options on this.  In fact, I think the play here is a neutral strategy-- think an iron condor or a short strangle, maybe with a little long bias, like a short strangle between 44-48.

I think of the three media stocks that tanked in the wake of Billy's collapse, ViacomCBS is only the second-best.  I think AMCX is a dumpster fire.  I think Discovery is the better play.

Shots not fired wildly are shots you still get to shoot.

Are you literally saying ""No company in the world today is a better buy than VIAC?""  Is that the argument you're making here, because I don't think it's hard to fill a list of companies that are better buys.

> If you were VIAC, had 6b on hand and generating PROFIT, how would you ensure your company remains profitable?

Pay down some of my massive debt.

It literally isn't.  It's actually the exact opposite of how they got bankrupt."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"What was their debt level before the pandemic?

What is it now?

Why would I be worried about them doing an acquisition if I own puts?  Don't company share prices usually dip when they go out and buy something?

Come to think of it, if I held puts, why would I worry about anything at this point?  Wouldn't I have just gotten a big fat payday?

Best of luck!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you, it is unlikely go back immediately to $100 level, but current price may be low and this is the time to buy such stock hold for nice dividend returns with longer holding (unless market corrects)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I am very obviously inferring that DISC is a massive acquisition option because they just dropped significantly in value, in a price range affordable by VIAC, and didnt just raise 3b in capital right before their stock price plummeted by over 50% like VIAC did.

You don‚Äôt clearly don‚Äôt understand debt, at all, see my other thread.  No point in replying to this one."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let‚Äôs talk about debt for a little bit since you dont seem to understand how it works.  

https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:VIAC/explorer/total_debt - Debt to Asset Ratio is 41.1%.

https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:NFLX/explorer/total_debt - Debt to Asset Ratio is 47%.

https://finbox.com/WBAG:DISC/explorer/total_debt - Debt to Asset Ratio is 47%.

https://finbox.com/NYSE:AMC/explorer/total_debt - Debt to Asset Ratio is 110%.

https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AAPL/explorer/total_debt - Debt to Asset Ratio is 37.8%.

https://finbox.com/NYSE:DIS/explorer/total_debt - Debt to Asset Ratio is 30.9%.

https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMZN/explorer/total_debt - Debt to Asset Ratio is 31.5%.

https://finbox.com/NYSE:T/explorer/total_debt - Debt to Asset Ratio is 34.8%.

https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:GOOG.L/explorer/total_debt - Debt to Asset Ratio is 8.7%.

All the stock that has a lower debt to asset ratio offers more services than VIAC and has significantly more ASSETS than VIAC and significantly more debt, hence why mentioning a companies debt without looking at its assets is very narrow sighted.  I could say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt invest in Apple, you see their debt last year?‚Äù (They have 4x the amount of debt that VIAC has but 7x as many assets.)  

VIACs debt to asset ratio has gone down from 48% in 2017 to 41.1% by the END OF 2020. VIAC has a downward trend of 7%, while Disney has gone up 6%, Apple has gone up 6%, and Netflix has gone up 9%. 

These are all EXTREMELY BULLISH metrics FOR VIAC which further indicates an acquisition is likely to happen in the next quarter."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure you'll need a lot more than $6b to acquire Discovery, lol."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot more, but they can afford to take on that debt to gain DISC and significantly increase their market share.

Discovery‚Äôs market cap just dropped to 20 billion from 54 billion.  It would make VIAC the most powerful streaming service with more content than any other provider in a single move."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has to be one of the most retarded ideas I've ever heard.  The whole problem facing VIAC is that they don't have an established streaming platform.  And you want them to borrow $20b, when they're already in a significant amount of debt, against their market cap of $28b, to try and buy a company that faces the exact same problem?

Even if Discovery decided it wanted to be acquired, how is ViacomCBS ever going to outbid Netflix/Disney/AT&T/Comcast-- you know, companies that would actually be synergistic?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, THEY DO NOT HAVE AN EXTREME AMOUNT OF DEBT.  Youre fucking stupid.  You clearly dont understand how debt works, every company in the world has debt.  Compare debt, assets, revenue and profit percentages.  Apple and Amazon has over a 100 billion dollars in debt you moron. Google has 2.3 TRILLION dollars in debt.  You have no idea what youre talking about.

Netflix has 3b dollars less debt than VIAC, while having 15 less BILLION in assets as of 2020."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Google has 2.3 TRILLION dollars in debt.

WTF are you smoking, Google does NOT have 2.3 trillion dollars of debt are you fucking insane.

Quick comparison.  Google?  Debt-equity ratio of 0.07.  ViacomCBS?  1.28.  For their size, VIAC has over 18x as much debt as Google.

Hey everyone.  Get a load of this guy.  He thinks Google has 2.3 trillion dollars of debt.  A total retard, amirite?

Get the fuck out of here you absolute clown."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alphabet's total debt decreased in 2016 (3.935 billion, -48.5%) and increased in 2017 (3.969 billion, +0.9%), 2018 (4.012 billion, +1.1%), 2019 (16.082 billion, +300.8%) and 2020 (27.872 billion, +73.3%).

2021-04-04 20:47:43,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) post I made 2 days back. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c

GameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.

**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported

* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.
* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.

**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab‚Ñ¢ stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. 

**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.

**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound 

**SOME FAQ‚Äôs:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments

 Ticker: [BFLY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BFLY/)  
   
 **TLDR**: BFLY is a software company pretending to be a medical device company.  By 2023, they will bring in significantly more revenue from subscriptions to their cloud services  than from selling their actual flagship POCUS devices. [Skip to the Bull Case](#the-bull-case)

5. Conclusion
6. Positions
  
### Overview  
[Butterfly Network](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/)  makes Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) devices and a cloud based ecosystem to back it.  
     
BFLY's flagship device is the [Butterfly iQ+](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/iq), a point-of-care ultrasound imaging device that connects to a smart phone or tablet.  From their website: 

> the world‚Äôs only single-probe, whole-body handheld device, powered by
> Ultrasound-on-Chip‚Ñ¢ technology
  
###  Ultrasound?  Isn't that the thing where you slather a bunch of jelly on a pregnant woman's belly and x-ray her unborn baby?  Who cares about that shit?  
    
 Doctors do.  Doctors care about that shit.  And you can do a lot more than take pictures of your wife's boyfriend's unborn child.  

What do doctors use ultrasounds for?  In short, they allow doctors to look inside their patients.  Doctors can use ultrasounds to diagnose conditions, including those in the heart, blood vessels, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, uterus, ovaries, eyes, thyroid, and testicles.  
  
Point of Care Ultrasound, or POCUS, is all about using sonography to diagnose problems wherever a patient is being treated, whether that's in a modern hospital, an ambulance, or a remote village.  
   
POCUS has been touted, albeit probably hyperbolically, as the 'replacement for the stethoscope'. 

### Competition 
  
A traditional Ultrasound machine, [looks like this](https://www.medcorpllc.com/product/philips-epiq-7/), and costs anywhere from $15,000 to over $100,000, and needs to be wheeled around on a cart.      
  
Butterfly IQ+ costs $2000, is about the size of an electric razor, and works with an iPad or smartphone.  This is because of their patented 'Ultrasound on a Chip' technology.  
  
  

The image the IQ+ produces is not as high quality as a traditional ultrasound, but for many applications, super high resolution imagery is just not necessary to make accurate diagnosis.  It's not meant to be a total replacement for traditional sonography, more like a 21st century stethoscope.
  

    
   Phillips, GE, and others have attempted (poorly) to enter the POCUS space.  They are all significantly more expensive and less feature rich:  
   
   [GE VScan $7900](https://canadiem.org/handheld-ultrasound-a-review-of-the-vscan/)  
   [Phillip's Lumify $7000](https://www.aedsuperstore.com/lumify-ultrasound-system-philips-healthcare.html)  
   [Clarius $4900](https://clarius.com/scanners/l15/l15-pricing/)    
   [**Butterfly IQ+ $2000**](https://store.butterflynetwork.com/us/en/product/butterfly-iq/pro/)    
 
  Butterfly is the only solution that covers linear, curved and phased mode with a single probe. GE offers a dual-probe-one-device solution that is not cost effective. Philips is even more ridiculous, you have to buy three probes to cover all the spectrum.  
    
 Butterfly owns a stack of patents for their proprietary technology including 'Ultrasound on a Chip'  https://www.butterflynetwork.com/patents  
   
 Butterfly Network has agreements in place with the majority of the largest 100 hospitals in the United States and is commercially available in more than 20 countries including the United States, Canada, greater Europe and Australia.


    
## The Bull Case: 
  
### This is a SAAS company disguised as a medical device company  
(**S**oftware **A**s **A** **S**ervice you fucking smoothbrain).
  
 From Butterfly's March 29th earnings call:  
 > Product revenues for the full year 2020 were $38.3 million, an increase of 53% from $25.1 million in 2019  
 > ....  
> Subscription revenues were $7.9 million in 2020, growing 216% from
> $2.5 million in 2019. 

**Hold up. Did I hear that right?**
**216% Year over year subscription revenues**.    
**4x the growth of their device sales.**  
  
Given that rate, software sales would basically catch up to hardware sales by 2022 and almost double them by 2023.  
 
| Year| Device Revenue (53% YoY) | Subscription Revenue (216% YoY)
| ----------- | ----------- |----
| 2020 | 38.3m | 7.9m
| 2021 | 58.6m | 25m
| 2022 | 89.7m | 78.9m
| 2023 | 137.2m | 249.3m
  
Butterfly's software is seriously impressive, comprehensive, and ambitious.    
https://www.butterflynetwork.com/enterprise  
   
We're talking HIPAA compliant Document solutions / storage, Billing, Telemedicine, Workflows, Credentialing, Education, Fleet Management, Analytics, QA, etc.  

This is not an app thrown together to support a device.  This is an ecosystem.  

While the iQ+ is an innovative, best in class product that is selling like hotcakes, BFLY's holders are actually going to get rich off that sweet, sweet subscription revenue.  

### Supply Chain  

Wait a minute.. 'Ultrasound on a Chip'? As in 'Chip Shortage'?  
How are they going to continue to rapidly grow their subscription revenues if there is a crunch on production of their devices amidst a global chip shortage?  

From their earnings call, during the Q&A:  

> we have a very strong partnership with TSMC and that's both an
> engineering partnership that has been going for the last years. We've
> looked to develop the iQ+ as well as a manufacturing partnership. As
> part of that, we do have a committed supply agreement with them. And
> so, **we feel very confident, both in their ability to deliver the
> semiconductor wafers that we need for our current production, as well
> as to help us meet additional demand, should it materialize**. We think
> this partnership is a competitive strength and the availability of
> wafers in the midst of a global shortage is just one example of the
> value of that partnership.

Looks like they're all set.  Can Phillips and GE say the same right now?

### Jonathan Rothberg  
  
Butterfly Network's founder and top shareholder also happens to be the dude who invented high-speed, ‚ÄúNext-Gen‚Äù DNA sequencing.  [Jonathan Rothberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rothberg).  
  
This guy is a certifiable genius.  He runs an incubator called [4Catelyzer](https://www.4catalyzer.com/) that has a focus on 'medicine, engineering, and machine learning', it looks like a bullpen of potential future Butterflies.  

He's also the founder of Quantum-Si which is going public via SPAC merger.
  
###  Aunt Cathie and ARKG
    
 Alright, you knew it was coming.  We can't ignore the fact that ARK funds have been absolutely gobbling up BFLY since it went public via SPAC merger with LGVW.  
   
 https://cathiesark.com/arkg-holdings-of-bfly  
   
 ARKG has doubled its stake in BFLY in the past month.  
 

 

[In this interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/17/arks-cathie-wood-on-deep-value-stocks.html) from Feb 17, Cathie talks about an upcoming 'valuation reset' and how ARK will consolidate into 'higher conviction' holdings.  She also happens to name drop Butterfly specifically.  

Since then, a valuation reset has certainly occurred (or is occurring) for many of ARK's holdings, and ARK has consistently and aggressively accumulated BFLY.   

As of Friday 4/3/21 ARKG owned 3.74% of BFLY and it made up 1.05% of the fund.  Both significant increases from just a month prior.    
  
**Recent purchases**:  

| Date | Number of Shares Purchased
| ----------- | ----------- 
| April 1 | 274300
| March 31 | 621228 
| March 30 | 487344 
| March 29 | 232316

| March 8 | 233248
| March 5 | 989100
| March 4 | 554757
| March 3 | 390584

Just under 900k shares in the last 2 trading days alone.  

### Pets  

Pet stocks have been on an absolute tear this year and don't really seem to be slowing down (CHWY, IDXX, ZTS, CHD  ).  
  
 Cue [Butterfly Network iQ Vet](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/vet/iq-vet), a solution tailored specifically for Veterinarians with an affordable pricing plan.  

***Integrated Pet Telemedicine*** sounds like a fucking meme designed to trigger wallstreet algos to buy but that's [literally what they are offering](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/vet/teleguidance-vet ).   

  
### Developing Countries  
   
 It doesn't take a genius to figure out why a $2000 POCUS that connects to a mobile phone would be a game changer for practitioners in developing countries / remote areas.  NYT article from last year:  
    
  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/health/medical-scans-butterfly-iq.html  
    
Did I mention the [B&M Gates Foundation Strategic Investment Fund](https://sif.gatesfoundation.org/investments/butterfly-network/) is an early investor in BFLY?  


### Technical Setup
[Drew a line on the chart with a crayon for the TA boiz](https://ibb.co/VLQgMdm)  


### The Bear Case  
They are currently spending more than they are bringing in.  
  
They have competitors with a large moats and market share in the space they are trying to disrupt.  
  
They are a growth stock in a market that seems to be finicky about growth right now.   
    
3B Market Cap on  $45 million revenue last year.  

Limited TAM
   
SPAC merger  
  
ARK touch of death  
  

## Conclusion  

- Their cloud based subscription business is growing significantly faster than their hardware sales and at the current rate of growth will surpass hardware sales by 2022-2023.    
- They are delivering the best device for the lowest cost in a genuinely disruptive space and backing it with a seriously impressive ecosystem.  
- iQ Vet for Veterinarians has expanded their potential market and could accelerate the business' growth.  
- Cathie and ARK funds fucking *love* this thing.

That‚Äôs the bear case. You‚Äôve got other companies with their foot in the door of departments, and those companies have a wide moat, as others have said. 
Also, our latest Sonosites weren‚Äôt too expensive. If I recall, maybe around $9-$10k."

From the hospital perspective, they are thinking: great toy, we already have a bunch of these machines that are way better. Why should we buy you this and also lock ourselves into a recurring cost of a subscription?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree. Another point to add would be the liability. Helpful to do if you quickly want to r/o a ddx. I'd rather have the US tech +  radiologist do the reading who have spent years training for this.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,is it useful? does it fundamentally change how you operate daily?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No. It doesn't change anything at all. It's really more of a toy. But it can be pretty fun to scan your thyroid and kidneys and shit and see what all you got going on. I even scanned a pregnant donkey one time.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I kind of want one just for the amusement. I can't really see myself using it frequently in actual practice. If it was a $500 device I'd buy one now.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This won't end well....
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt think it will work. Cause you are putting dollars on a card. So even if you buy a $100 gift card, that card will still be worth $100 and a latte will cost $50."

If the dollar collapses and we experience inflation a drink will cost even more and that $10 gift card won‚Äôt even buy you one drink because the gift cards are still denominated in USD. 

Now if there was a gift card for one cup of coffee and you bought it that would be a good investment, you might even want to use it now in airport Starbucks where everything is extra expensive"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah man, just 3:1 leverage SPY puts"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dumb aoe here... But why not buy bulk gold or silver? The actual tangible ones.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why on God‚Äôs green earth would you do that?! Aren‚Äôt the gift cards linked to the value of the dollar? This makes no sense to me!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the best thing I've ever seen
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Why Starbucks? Surely amazon gift cards would be more valuable?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"The card is valued in USD, so you still loose when the dollar drops.

Also you pay sales tax on those cards (in and out when you use them)."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are Starbucks' gift cards sold at a discount? 

If you buy $100 worth of gift cards today for $90

And you sell that $100 gift (4/4/2022) for $95. 

You will have made... $5 profit in one year, or 5.56% profit.

(I feel like gift cards are always sold at a discount on eBAY... e.g., a $100 gift card sells for $80...)

One $92 share of $ITOT *should* appreciate at least that much this year. And it'll be easier to sell. (And you make the dividends!!!)

Maybe invest a few % of your portfolio in this and see if it pans out? Is this a five year investment?

Your better off investing in a S&P 500 index mutual fund/ETF or buying shares in a company with strong growth potential over the next 3-5 years.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was going to the post office anyway so it wasn‚Äôt out of my way.  And yes, I was buying large volumes of stamps for my business so it made sense to purchase that many. I would routinely send out over a thousand envelopes a month, not including first class packages and priority shipping boxes, which those stamps can be used for those as well.  I have also used stamps to send out first contact letters to distressed homeowners requiring first class stamps for postage.  

I think the thing most people assume is that I was going out of my way to go to the post office.  I was not, which makes the issue of gas and time irrelevant to the equation.  That money and time was spent anyway because I was already going.  This was just one more thing that needed being done while I was there and only added about 5 minutes to my visit.  I‚Äôve spent more time waiting on Lil old ladies asking teller questions about postage.  (No offense to the concerned Lil old ladies, I feel their plight)

And yes, I have bought thousands of stamps, so I realized the cost savings from this venture.  It may not be appropriate for everyone, but postage dramatically affected my bottom line, so I saw the benefit from it."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How much money are you saving that you‚Äôre spending time going to the post office to verify your stamps
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What kinda did you send with stamps?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I find this extremely unbelievable, but you do you."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, if you mail that quantity I guess it makes sense for you. I mail one or two things a month, takes me long time to burn through a roll of stamps, literally no benefit for me."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once on a trip in Bolivia, on the salt flat with a group of Germans, a girl said the food our guide made needed slat.  I laughed vociferuosly, and looked at the ground, we were standing on a gagillion tonnes of salt.



She did use some of the dirt salt!"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That sounds like a pretty killer situation if you have the land or warehouse space to store the oil.  You basically would have gotten paid to store it for a while, then sell it back once the price goes back into the positives."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I was laughing so hard I was crying... I need to rewatch that show
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve saved thousands of dollars in shipping fees.  But the goal wasn‚Äôt to get every stamp tested, more like a random sample of my purchase.  all of the stamps of one purchase were the same print like flag, or spiral star for example.  There were in sheets of ten, rolls of one hundred, or a coil of one (or two thousand, I can‚Äôt remember) stamps so not everyone needed testing.  I‚Äôve even got the stamps from stamps.com but those aren‚Äôt forever and were only good intra year to be relevant for this example.  What saved me the most time was buying in bulk from one ‚Äúreputable‚Äù seller.  There was one seller who kept some to the side specifically for me because I bought so mAny and I must have bought at least 10000 from that person.  That‚Äôs ultimately what you want because you don‚Äôt have to check behind that person, they always have what you want, and there is no problem doing business with him/her."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Mainly magic the gathering.  Cheap commons and uncommon that sold 4 for a dollar.  Stamped Envelopes were the primary means of transportation for those guys.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"For sure.  I don‚Äôt fault anyone for thinking contrary to buying stamps like I did.  I was just in a situation that made sense for me at the time.  Otherwise, I probably would have never stumbled into that venture.  And I agree with what you previously said, had I not been going to the post Office on the regular, adding in the time and gas would have most likely made that venture unprofitable, but considering I was going there anyway, I had nothing to lose.  It was a valuable experience and I learned a lot, and if someone has the ability to buy them in bulk like I did, it could be a profitable venture for the person willing to put in the work.  When It comes to making money, I have done worse for less, that‚Äôs for sure."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Finding somewhere legal to dump/store the oil, contracting with petro shipping companies to do pickup and delivery to the legal storage site.

Or...

Finding somewhere illegal to dump it, contracting under the table with shady petro companies with shadier drivers willing to do pickup and dump at your illegal dumping/storage site - a task probably better handled by organized crime.

Either way, middle men want their cut."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Storing oil isn‚Äôt something you just, like, ‚Äúdo‚Äù off the cuff when the market favors it, land or no land, warehouse or no warehouse. You need tens of millions of dollars of existing infrastructure and the regulatory and permitting apparatus already in place. And then if oil threatens to go negative, too bad, you‚Äôre already full because of favorable (to you) market dynamics. That‚Äôs why it goes negative."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah dude you're about to be rich. First edition just makes it insane, find those binders, and immediately sleeve those up in hard sleeves to protect the condition as much as humanly possible. 

I'm not an expert on where to get the appraisal done but I'm shocked you haven't heard how high the values are since it's definitely been in some news cycles. Even non-first edition of those pokemon I've listed hold decently significant value. But the more ""features"" you have in terms of high quality, condition, and rarity, means you could possibly buy a car or best case scenario, a house."

Sure that doesn‚Äôt matter now because of all the hype about gme switching to e-commerce‚Äôs do what not (not to mention it‚Äôs the number one cult stock) but hear me out. Is it possible these institutions are just riding the retail cult wave only to pull the rug soon as they reach a certain level of profits? Bound to happen IMO.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No.  And according to letter from Hestia and Permit the fact that Directors didn't have any skin in the game is major source of GME's issues.  Below is from their letter to shareholders from a year ago requesting their votes by proxy to add 2 Directors they nominated.  This has been brewing a long time.  

&#x200B;

>*""Mr. Kelly has been on the Board for 8 years and has never purchased a single share of GameStop stock. Mr. Kelly is Chairman of the Board‚Äôs Compensation Committee and has arguably had the largest role of any director in designing the Company‚Äôs misaligned bonus structure. Given his lack of stock purchases, it is unsurprising that the Company‚Äôs executive compensation isn‚Äôt more tightly aligned with stockholder value.""*  
>  
>*""Mr. Davis, who has been on the Board for 15 years, is the Chairman of the Nominating/Governance Committee and should be held primarily responsible for years of corporate governance failures. During his long tenure, Mr. Davis has only purchased a total of 890 shares, worth $16,888 ‚Äì back in 2006. More recently, he sold 38,900 shares, worth $1,479,639, that were granted to him as part of his annual director compensation. We feel strongly that someone with so little commitment to the Company should not hold such an important leadership position.""*  
>  
>Link to full letter is [here](https://f0c5bbc0-bc47-4244-ac04-93b6e88189dc.filesusr.com/ugd/b68ea3_301c2c4846b94b3fa63411b7211a6697.pdf).

TL,DR: The GME Board of Directors don't like the stock.  Major shareholders Permit and Hestia like the stock and are taken over the joint and have RC to get the job done.  This has been a deliberate, thoughtfully planned coup d'tat over the past 1-2 years.  If they like the stock, and we like the stock good chance they like us too."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't disagree with any of the cons. Blackberry is a company that dropped the ball hard with their smartphones. There's a chance they do it again.

This is before IVY is released in early access and before any overhead in their past business ventures comes off the books.

So some time was wasted, but they turned in time & had to do things like layoffs and sending 400 engineers to Ford, it was a sad time for BlackBerry but they survived and created a compelling product range & made the right acquisitions while recovering.

Now they are executing on those products & selling old IP they no longer have use for which will help drive this Go-To-Market plan, not all IP, just the stuff they won't be using in QNX/Cylance"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"fair enough QNX .. also IVY.. but I've worked all my career for multinational company mid-level and high-level decision makers and their ability to be ignorant AND indifferent to  nerd technology is fundamental. So I noted BB down 6 months ago as <<yes, good work, technically - wonder if anyone INFLUENTIAL will ever pick up on it?>>   And as far as I can see that's where it stands.   
Tesla have put their OS full of <Back To The Future> easter eggs out on public domain.. but the same multinational mandarins who are technically ignorant have HEARD of Tesla so probably (definitely) wont touch it at all, either, for hubris.  
Car manufacturers  are notoriously independent and separate - & will NOT do something simply because another HAS done it .. AND they are perversely secretive .. they compete, but only out in front in the public eye where the sales are .. behind the scenes in the tech they seem INCAPABLE of agreeing on any standards whatever.   
They do private deals behind closed doors that no one (even in the company) is supposed to know about.The ""nerds"" fall into the attitude of not knowing, not caring, and being ignored, then told what to do (even though they KNOW it's a technically BAD company decision).. \[hmm.. in general\].  
Standardized battery blocks MUST become normal in the future, as obvious as Molex, aint it? But WHO could have predicted that a company called ""Molex"" would become an international bedrock standard for every PC part manufacturer worldwide? (not even Molex)  
But BB do (have done) nice work, it's a fact. Perhaps some  ""important"" boardroom (somewhere) will USE it. What you say technically is the case, but from an investor view strictly I'd HAVE to say ""I wish it were true"".."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"These BB DD‚Äôs always talk about QNX being so great as it is preloaded in so many cars. There is no play or up-sale opportunity. If you see something, let me know. My car has Apple CarPlay but that doesn‚Äôt make it iCar. 

Overall, there is nothing new here, even when you add IVY. 

You‚Äôre missing what the EV revolution is about. It‚Äôs not swapping an ICE engine with an electric one."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">What makes BB a frontrunner? Any special IP or experience in automotive?

Yes, QNX is basically the leader in the market. Most automakers either use QNX or try to build their own software, but there aren't many other competitors out there. There is automotive Linux, but it lacks all the necessary security certifications for it to be a viable long term solution. So QNX has a pretty big moat, but they are NOT unique in the sense that given enough time and resources, a competitor can catch up."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"p.s. - the stock market and the consumer never noticed that Android is a bunch of UTTER crap built to rip off cash and plug advertising, and slave fidelity, to mega cynical exploiters. It is the Utter Disgusting RUBBISH remains of a GREAT public domain OS deliberately crippled so YOU (the owner) have NO choices. But has the public even NOTICED? - I have Android on my PC  (just to look at it and MESS with it) alongside Linux & Windows etc, and Android is embarrassing and SHAMEFUL. I don't GO THERE because it makes me sad, bitter, and utterly sick for the sake of humanity.. - OMG - But ""Didn't it do WELL."".  <vomit>   TRY explaining this to a non-nerd.  
IMO  
Maybe  Siemens or even Philips or Haas would be interested by BB."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Huh? The up-sale opportunity is literally IVY. Not only that, IVY is totally agnostic and will be designed to work on any OS. IVY will likely follow a subscription model (recurring revenue) for their data collection aspect, and it will also have a sort of app marketplace (revenue sharing). The fact that BB will not own the data can also be a plus for their customers and might be a reason they go with IVY instead of trying to roll their own platform.

If this isn't a gamechanger in the automotive world, I don't know what is.

Of course, since IVY isn't out yet, future success is totally speculative. As you pointed out, the EV revolution is not only about swapping drivetrain, and I do believe a platform like IVY will be integral to this revolution."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually agree with you. 

I do think there is a serious opportunity for a subscription model. Basically like AWS but for car manufacturers that are not Tesla. 

At this point, the question is who will get there first and be the dominant player. Other companies already offer simulation software for cars and such (CATIA). Elon was open to oem his self driving tech (not the whole thing). IVY could be it too...it is more targeted than CATIA. 

There was a time where there were too many eCommerce companies but only one dominates now. The EV SaaS Platform is the next play. This is like investing in Amazon in 2000."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who‚Äôs BB competition? If you say, Tesla it‚Äôs a wrap"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is definitely about execution now. BB built the right partnerships and product portfolio. They have everything set up for IVY, which will be deployed 8 months from now. 

Now we wait until they produce what they promised. If they can pull this off, I see a bright future ahead."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even better, Google! Lmao."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They're partnered with amazon

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a lot of truth to what you're saying. I think Tesla is a great bet at the current price. They're YEARS ahead of every other EV company, and if you break down the latest stimulus infrastructure bill, there is a TON of dollars in there that will benefit Tesla. I agree with you that EV has way further to go than most realize - heck, it may not be feasible at all, in reality - but the politicians don't seem to care and are happy to throw money at subsidies and infrastructure, which makes the stock a REALLY good bet, IMHO."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's face it 99.99% of people could give two shits if they make a boat load off of any of the stocks and the company goes down
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You are preaching to the choir my man.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmmm. 300 million more shares outstanding since January when there actually was a squeeze, only 11% short of float, 6 billion in debt, millions of cash dollars paid to executives recently from the money gained by the stock‚Äôs trading frenzy, another potential 500 million share dilution (which if apes don‚Äôt vote for, their company will be bankrupt in 3 years). Plus the fact that they were heading towards bankruptcy even before the pandemic, and most ‚Äúblockbusters‚Äù are being sold off to streaming companies. 

I don‚Äôt need to be less vague, you just need to learn how to read a company‚Äôs balance sheets and SEC filings. What all you tards regard as ‚ÄúFUD‚Äù is actually public information right in front of you! Don‚Äôt rely on some dipshit on YouTube to tell you that you‚Äôre making a sure bet on a stock, he‚Äôs already made enough money from apes like you watching his content, that his positions don‚Äôt even matter. Actually try and understand what makes or breaks a stocks price, why a short squeeze happens, and how a stock‚Äôs trading price actually arrives at that value. 

This coming from someone who has already made money on the stock, saw the writing on the wall and then got out. You want to hold, good luck, it‚Äôll be a good decade at best, don‚Äôt say others haven‚Äôt warned you. Just put your blinders on, and go back to the other subs where you‚Äôll find continual confirmation bias, if you can‚Äôt see both cases for something you invest in, then you shouldn‚Äôt be investing at all."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not shorting them lol I would never bet against GME or AMC
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you know how the  forward-looking markets work? Requesting a vote on this option to dilute dumped AMC 10% in a day. If the vote passes, AMC will dump another 20-30% over the span of a few days even if the dilution won't feasibly happen for months."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apparently B. Riley Securities does as they just said AMC is 38% undervalued and the PT is $13. When I see essays written on why AMC or any other popular stocks should go down, I know it's pure FUD for their own gain. No difference here."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I already factored in the new dilution. But yes, it's a joke."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">The number of outstanding shares is 450m. They're about to offer 500m more shares as soon as next month!

Why does everyone keep saying this like it already happened? They're not ""about"" to do anything, there is an on-going shareholder vote to even introduce those shares. Secondly, even if it passes, that doesn't mean ""issuance"".  Until everyone knows for certain the vote ""For"" passed, this is flat out misinformation."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well def not a photo or proof, but judging off where you gathered your exit strategy I think I‚Äôve heard enough."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting to consider. I do have fairly high confidence the May 4 shareholder meeting will tank the stock in the short-term (before & after it occurs), so I have puts for this month and late May & June accordingly. I'm scraping profits in the meantime every time it crashes. If the stock is like $3-5 by then, I might consider just dumping everything while you're up, because who knows if this has another meme run-up like you said. The more they hand AMC money, the better off the company will be financially. And I didn't mean to be all doom & gloom about movie theatres in general, because I think there is a place for them in the future, but it's not going to look pretty in the near term (imo, but maybe unexpected & positive box office news will lead to some gains).

This is going to sound dumb, but I have been buying up AMC calls as hedges whenever I catch wind of GME news. The other day, for example, I was up 20% on calls I picked up a few hours earlier because I was expecting GME to make movements based on some news posted here. Now this clearly won't always work, but recently AMC has popped when GME itself has reason to pop. And the funny thing is, there almost seems to be a delay in AMC's reaction to GME climbing, so you have some time to pick up calls as a hedge to your position (not that it should matter so much if you have long puts)."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you think I give care enough to do all that just to show some rando on the internet proof of when I got out on the upswing? You are lucky I even spent the time to sign in and check. I get that that guy suck, but it was another person confirming what I suspected and it caused me to get out at the right time considering it hasn't gone back up since then. Stop hating because you are holding bags."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I think GME's squeezing is more or less done.

Ryan Cohen & the ecommerce transition is bullish for the long term though. I don't hate the stock, I'm just not buying back into it at 100+. Just take gains when you are comfortable and don't wait for a PT that's above 500, because I seriously doubt that will happen this year (maybe over the looong term). Prepared to be wrong though because anything can happen with these meme stocks.

Quadrupled my money from GME in January, so it's not like I'm a hater. Just not interested in the volatility right now and worried it will either trade sideways or worse, have the bottom fall out. But take what I say with a grain of salt!"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think tour right. I jumped in too when it went from 40 to 90. I was following it for since the squeeze (never traded before). But i guess that indeed many people jumped wagon when everyone here was saying ""THE SQUEEZE DIDNT HAPPEN YET"" and stuff like that. That convinced me to buy some shares haha, and i was right to do so. Because i bought at 100-130, and it has never gone back to that haha (well, the 120 day last week, but that was just super sale)"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, I honestly think last year's price action was a result of two things - 1) activist investor interest (they usually result in price appreciation once they get involved) and 2) saying on record that short interest was so high for the first time. Because we know that the funds did not recall their lent shares for the shareholder vote, I don't see that as being a catalyst as much as the other two. There are a lot of investors and funds who love to invest in companies that are being targeted by activists and the short interest would've made it extra tantalizing."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"When the stock freezes, it hit a circuit breaker. That‚Äôs normal: that‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre freezing it to manipulate it. If the stock jumps anywhere form 10-15% in less than a minute, the stock freezes."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">*Either way I don‚Äôt really see autodesk mooning. Engineering/construction companies are some of the slowest to adapt to new tech, and many times consulting firms and construction companies are trying to reduce cost and the number of licenses they need in each software*

This lines up with my experience. Sure, Autodesk software is ubiquitous, but that just leads me to believe that it really *can't* grow that much bigger than it currently is. There's not many new sectors for them to break into. 

In the longer-term I feel like it's more likely for a competitor to sink fangs into ADSK's ass than for ADSK to moon. 

Software licensing fees are brutal and companies are trying to get away from being bent over the barrel. I know at some of the larger firms they're *very* slow to acquire new licenses. At smaller firms like mine we try and do anything else - we developed our own solution method rather than license ADAPT-FELT, for example. 

The US having a big infrastructure spend would be good for US-based construction companies, and decent for engineering companies, but I don't think it's more than a blip for a software company. It won't be a *bad* thing but looking at the price history of ADSK I don't think I'd like to buy in."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep yep, I agree 100%. You have far more industry experience than I do but we can both recognize the high barrier to entries from end-to-end here, which is where the pot of gold is over a long period of time."

here's where i'm taking the notion that they started already from, its in section C, it seems we're in the runway period as they label it..could be wrong, but it sure seems like it

Pursuant to the proposed rule change, DTC would remove the Business-as-Usual Actions section (currently Section 8.6.1) in its entirety because each of the actions outlined have either been completed or would be addressed in DTC's internal procedures going forward. This includes certain documents necessary to effect the wind-down aspects of the Plan that were in the process of being finalized when the Plan was adopted and have since been completed. Since adoption of the Plan,[32] DTC has completed all necessary internal documentation, including DTCC's internal wind-down guidance, the constituent documentation for the Failover Entity, and the evaluation of DTC's capitalization options. Further, the other actions included in this section (e.g., maintaining an index of non-critical services, educating the Board on the Plans) would be addressed, going forward, in DTCC's Recovery & Resolution Planning Procedures maintained by the R&R Team.[33] As a result of this proposed change, current Section 8.6.2 (Recovery and Runway Period Actions) would be renumbered as Section 8.6.1. Also, consistent with the proposed removal of Business-as-Usual Actions that have been completed, the proposed rule change would remove from the first sentence of proposed Section 8.6.1 (current Section 8.6.2) the words ‚ÄúAmong other things, the guidance would provide‚Äù and replace them with ‚ÄúThe DTCC Clearing Agency Wind-Start Printed Page 17426down Guidance developed in connection with this Plan provides.‚Äù

i am gonna have some digging because i may have seen the specific of timing in 003 or 004 rather than this one.tldr yeah i agree. they have a fun definition of 'proposed'; although it really is for the  best they ask for forgiveness than permission here lol, what else can they really do...have a bunch of short data proprietary and non trying to keep updated at ftp://ftp.virus.delivery/pub/, anything interesting, upload works too, i'l public it..there are a couple text files and images there of some interesting comparisons, the text file on gme is short exemp, short, and daily all total volume since they started breaking out short exempt in mid 2017 , for gme...i also calculated the figures at the bottom daily for a year as well, using sed, bash, bc, grep in no particular order sopainfully..most of them are updating on cron jobs, the data sources, except cboe..theyre a pain in the ass, need to manually update them for now. the gme test is just stuf from nyse but you could add the rest and go back to 2009 and include arca , and also data from ibkr in there as well...most of them leak info various ways, just picking it and keeping it in one place."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 1117 shares this morning! I'm excited to see where it goes.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Did this thing get longer?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,How do we know a buyout isn't already priced in? This shit was $2/share in November
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs BAFF? But def building out a position here as EV‚Äôs become a focus upcoming years.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Is MVIS gonna see a dip anytime soon?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have  a question about MVIS.  If the company is expected to be bought, why would  the stock run up and/or why would a shareholder expect to receive a premium from the price negotiated with the acquirer?  If a firm buys MVIS they will offer shareholders something around that negotiated price.  Why would they offer a premium (a stock price runup)?  Also, when MVIS cut their R&D over the past year by about 50%, this seemed to me to verify that they were very close to a deal.  This is an honest question folks.  What am I missing?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,So why are they putting lidar in cars again? Sounds like cameras with extra steps.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,itm call for august? can you explain your thought process?

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Our auto LiDAR is superior to LAZR, which is currently valued at $8B. Not to mention we have consumer LiDAR and AR verticals that just because a lot more valuable. MVIS is still very undervalued."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was more risk last year because before their $13M ATM they were at risk of running out of cash runway. The $13M and $50M ATM‚Äôs put them in a much stronger financial position to explore strategic partnerships, including the sale of one or multiple verticals."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish as Fucking Fuck
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"We‚Äôre consolidating at the top of the golden retracement zone from the last big move. I see us continuing to trade sideways between $15.20-16.20 until we get enough volume for another breakout. Once we close above $16.20 that will be our new support, then we will look for a close above the previous high of $19.20 to signal another large breakout into the $20‚Äôs. Bullish flag pattern on the charts so it is only a matter of time before that happens. There is a chance we break down below and retest support if greater market conditions pull us down (ie another Nasdaq correction due to rising bond yields), but I see I staying here and consolidating before the next move up. You could get in now or wait until after we close above $16.20."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,More accurate than cameras for autonomous driving. Cameras are too subject to interference. Ask Tesla‚Äôs PR department.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk man, I just work at Wendy‚Äôs. If it spikes in the short term on the buy out angle, can reorganize and go in with more shares. If it is volatile for months, it gives room for the company to grow and sell the c down the road on intrinsic value while messing with shares on the dips and peaks. So in august if I get caught out if rhythm in shares, I still have the call. I apologize for pooping in the frosty machine, sir. I haven‚Äôt been housebroken."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Various discord channels, stock twits, reddit, YouTube. Just searching for low cost stocks (<1$) with okay debt, hopefully a strong portfolio, and room to grow."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs pretty legit. I was looking at 35 leaps lol. But risky if the buyout is less than 35 strike price
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean subject to interference? 

Also how accurate of a measurement do you think you need to drive autonomously?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Less accurate due to weather conditions, snow causing the road to be obscured, etc. Tesla recently hit a cop cruiser in auto-mode.  There have been a number of Tesla accidents in auto-mode, Google it. You have to be incredibly accurate when lives are at stake... it‚Äôs a safety issue. Detailed specs on MVIS 4D LiDAR is in the deep dive link if you want to learn more."

I guess where I was going with it was that eventually there will be a crash, its just knowing when is more critical than the knowledge that it will happen, as that's essentially a certainty"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"No sorry let me clarify, I mean they own a lot of the stocks so profits from it are most likely used to invert GME"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahhh gotcha. Thanks for clarifying.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs the same with that silver crap they were promoting a while back. ‚ÄúLook Apes Silver squeeze. A durrr‚Äù üôÑ They are not stupid. When you buy their stocks you are distracted from buying GME & giving them more time to stash/ slither their slimy money into more SPACs. Which is all they been doing lately.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im totally bullish on OCGN for months. India is responsible for 65% of the worlds vaccine distribution and production. Seeing what Covaxin is about is some serious different shit compared to other vaccines that I personally myself would rather take over them. 

Im not a medical expert but seeing how they claim confidently that their vaccine is way better in multiple different ways makes me bet my life that this will easily get FDA approval.

This stock has so many bears that cluelessly  do their DD's and hate this stock for no good reason. They are the same people who think higher efficacy in a vaccine means that, that vaccine must be better than the other one while clearly ignoring the quality of the actual vaccine.

I might be wrong and feel free to correct me If i said something wrong but damn. Im just very confident about this one.

My guess is: $720-730 open. Could see a dip to 700 followed by a rip and if overall market conditions are bullish then a potential 20% day could happen"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It wasn‚Äôt priced in then IMO. Take a look at the historical movements in anticipation of the initial delays in clearance.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,No it shot up to $70 instantly

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"We hear so many reasons.
1- the shutdowns cause a huge back log
2- during the shut downs a ton of home improvement, adding or redoing deck created demand
3- the shutdown created an unseen demand as businesses, mostly restaurants built exterior venues
4-the huge unemployment payment created a disincentive for many to come back to work in the mills
5-mortgage rates very low
6-very few existing homes for sall driving new construction
7-shortage of various components used to produce panels, ie adhesives for OSB
The list really goes on and on."

It was $120 to do in metal that‚Äôs counting the metal studs and top and bottom plate. When doing the same linear footage in wood at $12 a 2x4 it‚Äôs double the price because the wood is more expensive you know....framing so I guess thanks for the concern but I think we got it thanks üòä

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I run a UK ecommerce business that sells across all the usual marketplaces and our own site. Throughout 2020 and into the 1st quarter of this year we have actually seen a steady increase in the proportion of our customers choosing PayPal at checkout. My worry for PayPal is recruitment of new customers in the future. I would speculate that eBay is the marketplace where most PayPal consumers first encounter and sign up for accounts. EBay's recent adoption of their own payments system (provided by Dutch payment platform ADYEN) is certainly going to hurt PayPal in this respect, probably a great deal more than the loss of revenue from their former monopoly as payment provider on that marketplace.

Also for retailers their fees are exorbitant. In this respect STRIPE wins hands down. Watch out for their IPO which may happen sometime this year."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Paysafe only has those tier 2 contracts in gaming and gambling because it wasn't worth the hassle for the big boys to get involved, given the regulatory headache and other risks. It's not going to stay this way. The major processors are coming. I could see Paysafe as a ripe acquisition target down the line."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs trading like 50 times revenue and the commercial business is growing at 5% Companies already blew their load on ERP, they don‚Äôt want to buy like this anymore.

Also it‚Äôs the biggest dumbfuck argument out there. ‚ÄúIf we just capture x% of the market we will be worth x billions. You can say that about any stock.

Based on your response I strongly suggest you check yourself emotionally. You are clearly married to the stock and will ride it to zero if you are wrong."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are clueless.

PLTR is much more than ERP software.

PLTR revenue is growing at 40%+ per year for the next 5 years.

At least know the facts.

Short the stonk if you have any ballz."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes there are several including the giant in the sector SAP. I see this as non-news for pltr and aws.

Your point on ec2 is accurate, but there's no incentive here to buy PLTR for people already on aws."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got whacked jumping into weekly calls this week, but have now bought shares and some long dated calls. I think you have a decent play here."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm buying as it goes down. I'm hoping for a few weeks of low volatility to just keep buying more cheap leaps.

When it comes to risk, sharing is caring"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,You should take a look at calendar spreads. Fun stuff with that kind of mindset.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn't matter because if you are smart you'll be selling weekly further otm calls using them as collateral.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll have to look into that my man
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Imo what robinhood does and the others selling the info should be insider trading giving all that data away. Rather selling it. Is fucked up
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,One of you dumbasses were feeling frisky this week
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Except when they got the info about covid and dropped all their shares
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"completely unrelated, they just finally fell in love with a very expensive house and decided to sell all their stock and move to a discrete location. pure coincidence, no correlation at all and you cant prove it."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,are you using Wells Fargo Advisors to trade?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Wells Fargo the investment arm is completely separate from the unauthorized account creation arm.  The investment company was formerly Wachovia and Wells Fargo bought them.

Saving money causes stagnation in an economy, after all, an economy is money moving, the faster, the more fluid, the better.  We want it to not be true, because we know it's bad money management, but it is true and works.  Will it pop some day, maybe, but for the time being, steady inflation and massive debt works, and saving and paying in cash, stagnates.  That's the difference between the 2 economies, which are only in this state due to culture."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought 5 more stocks (25 in total). To the moon friends!
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,They obviously had to deliver some cars twice because wrong address
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you even know what a P/E ratio even is? Being so high 100% means that a ton of future earnings are already priced in. Unless people are buying tesla planning on waiting 1000 years to get a return on the value.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure the S curve of adoption has to stop eventually, that's why it's an S curve, but like everything else, timing is everything so I'd be careful with the orders of magnitude because 1m to 1.5m may not that big of a deal."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was just throwing out random numbers to illustrate a general point that high rates of growth are rarely sustainable in the long run. Lots of people are predicting exponential growth for a lot longer than I think it can be sustained, especially if they think Tesla will really attain the kind of global dominance necessary to justify it's current valuation."

500,000,000 shares that not a living soul will know about because the May 4th vote hasn't been finalized.

Aron's bonus, which was actually 2/3rds what it was in 2019, but they think 15 million in class B shares don't fluctuate based on market value. This was also written into his contract during 2020 and had nothing to do with the 2021 retail boom."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I guarantee you I would have no problem using them if I needed extra hands on the job and I'm only 28. That's just a contractor thing. We like giving 5 guys 100 dollars for the day to do $500 worth of work
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's fine if you're a contractor, and want to put your name on the line.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. The ""12"" you see there gives him the right to buy GME for 12 dollars a piece. He bought a contract called a call option. He doesn't have to use his contract and buy the stock. He can also just sell the contract to another but I wager he will exercise the contract meaning he is going to buy 50 000 gme for 12 dollars a piece. 

Hope this clear things up."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Welp I‚Äôm an idiot and thought I was buying them after hours. But turns out I wasn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt buy them till this morning at 2.60 instead of .60 so it‚Äôs not going great. But live and learn
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,This bet just sounds fun. I want to see this slap.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ehhhhhhhhhhhh hard to say. If it were me I wouldn't do it; I only went for 4/16s for the short term play and because I have an aversion for paying for theta that I know I won't use. ASO is going to have a hard time expanding and the long-term upside past 4/16 is limited IMO. If you're really a long holder I'd go for leaps or shares: the price in May is as likely to drop as it is to continue going up.

Maybe if I see some really convincing patterns, after I sell my 4/16s I'll roll some over into 5/21s. Otherwise, I feel like if you didn't get in today, it's too late unless you really love playing with fire."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought PLUG Puts and PGE Calls based on the recommendations provided by the S&P Global Excel. Does PGE make sense for those that have vetted the document?

&#x200B;

Now, that said, as much as it would surprise me to see Bloom get added to it, it wouldn't surprise me to see CLNE get in there.  That seems a more natural fit for their tone.

&#x200B;

The one thing I'm certain of (and I'm sure this was probably already mentioned in the original DD, but I haven't taken the time to read it just yet) is that $PLUG is going to get skullfucked."

At least you are being realistic.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems like it though I'll be honest my technical analysis skills are pretty weak. I'm more a momentum trader and a people reader. 

I think Cathie Wood is right about the huge potential value of disruptive tech and NNDM has that along with a billion dollars in the bank to expand. 

I could see it going below 8 if the whole market dips but I don't think it would stay under for long. I'm guessing a lot of folks are trying to feel out if this is the bottom. 

If you're on the fence you could sell the April 7.50 puts an see if you get lucky.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,completely agree. OP is a fool.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,there's about $50K left (pre-market Sunday night). May roll to July if we don't moon today.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I may roll out to July, but that's $900K lost right there at the moment."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish you the best of luck in all seriousness my friend. I‚Äôm hoping my measely $150c for 4/30 and 20 shares print soon as well. Good luck to us both, may the moon be with us"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,R U happy now?
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing you said is wrong, but I have some counters. This was my first ever DD so I'm not going to pretend it's top tier.

1. $BEAM would be fair to include, you're right. Caribou is probably the biggest opportunity of them all, with their (relative) focus on ag/non-human. I've mentioned this in other comments, in this post and others. I'll be following their path to IPO very closely... but until they start making concrete plans, idk how to factor them into the game
   1. That being said, $NTLA is a spinoff of Caribou licensed to use a lot of their tech, so I'd say their futures are linked together at better-than-random chances
2. $CRSP may have the most advanced program, but that's not the only thing that matters. I'll admit I don't know their work as well as I should. Who knows, they might be my next DD
3. It's not a cure in the practical sense yet, of course. But if they can figure out how to get it to work, it actually treats the cause of the disease rather than managing and compensating for the symptoms. You have to think of how someone not trained in science would react to the idea that this technology provides the opportunity to cure so so many diseases that were considered un-curable at best, and a death sentence at worst.
4. I tried to make it clear in the post these are long term holds. Even if ARK pops, these are solid companies doing cutting edge research with world-changing technology. On a decades scale, sure, one or more will fall behind and get bought out. But every one of those labs is regularly going to be putting out headline-worthy results for years. Besides, the whole market is fucky right now.
5. Yes, being an orphan drug isn't special in itself, but it means $NTLA was able to demonstrate that their treatment has some real promise."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,">But if they can figure out how to get it to work, it actually treats the cause of the disease rather than managing and compensating for the symptoms.

The standard of care, patisiran, already does this. It silences the gene that causes ATTR. Other drugs in the space like acoramidis and tafamidis focus on the cause as well.

But otherwise I'll stop being harsh. NTLA could be quite exciting if this data hits, since Onpattro is monthly IV and NTLA's thing is one-time use."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"here is the yearly PCG anaylisis lol. Every year they are in it for some reason or another.

ongoing government lava dumpster fire inside a black hole.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol fuck you.  You could multiply your portfolio 5x and still not have my value, bitch.  You stupid fuck, you actually think going short a stock makes it go down.  Shows how much of a stupid fuck you are.  Bitch."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Dips before rips bro everyone knows.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I sure hope you yolod slowly. I did and I still didn't catch the dip on all accounts. I'll dm youlol
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually I dont know how or how to screen it. But im 59 shares or so in at this moment contemplating a deposit into  my td ameritrade to get more or go to sleep til near 7 im not sure lol .

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"An insurance company that bleeds money, has tanked ever since their recent IPO and is currently being sued by shareholders for securities fraud.

Yeah I think I'm with the shorts on this"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also of note, as the OP suggested, if they could capture 2% of the insurance market then they would be crazy high value compared to now. Well, 2% would be 5B in sales and they currently have like 350M... So what are the chances they 15x their current sales?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,It sounds like their superfuture tech anticipated the upcoming accident and preemptively raised your premiums. Bullish af
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought there is no Apple partnership it was a rumor. And now Apple still searching most likely Lucid.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apple met with them in 2020. Apple wanted to acquire, Canoo turned them down and wanted an investment instead. Things could be different now with the new CEO. If you were Apple, would you rather acquire a $2b company (Canoo) or one that‚Äôs overly hyped and expensive at $40b+ (Lucid)?"
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am thinking of it as if I were Apple would I want to sell a $30k not so pretty car or slap Apple on a $80k car that is about luxury.  Apple will provide design, tech, and marketing. They just need a factory. Which Lucid has in Arizona and capacity will be there in 3 years when Apple is ready to roll out the car. 

Btw your bangbus post was great. I did make money on my trade for GOEV. And will look to get back in, so keep up your informative posts."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope you‚Äôre right, about half my net worth is in FB. I particularly enjoyed the news of a leak that nobody cared about as it went up 3% today."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, they have a 26 billion dollar share buy back in the works with no set date on when they'll start the buying."
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you see a lot of loss porn and no real reason e.g. when the company is only starting to execute go-to-market & being beat up for missing IP $$ that is delayed & not lost due to ongoing negotiations, scaring retail off & the obvious bagholding from Jan27th.

The EV makers are using BB - 68% in fact, IVY platform is being released this Autumn which provides streaming revenue from both OEM for their data-lake and auto owners for whizz-bang apps which use their own IVY data.

That is the time to start taking a position. When it's cheap, in batches so as to capture the dip spread which allows for dips/rips.

So you say maybe it will get cheaper? Maybe, but maybe not.

Up again 1.4% in pre-market today...now $8.72"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Cancer market but we also need the attention of all the apes on this. Does the rest of the sub even know about APHA‚Äôs earnings and merger with Tilray? Had to dig deep for this DD. It‚Äôs all about deciphering tweets and astrological finance now.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the differentiation that Fubo has with live sports, but my concern is another private company that most people have probably heard of: DAZN. When it comes to acquiring the rights for sports streaming, DAZN has done a much better job securing top sports partnerships (NFL including Redzone, EPL, Champions League, MLB etc.) Dazn has acquired the sports leagues and games people actually want to watch. With Fubo, looking at their current lineup of sports partnerships and content, its kind of shitty tbh. Nothing compelling on there.

Thats my biggest hangup about Fubo for the moment."

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,I told you guys you‚Äôd end up bagholding this POS stock.
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,"Second deal didn‚Äôt announce - company is doing an investor conference at Cowen tomorrow, hopefully can explain themselves. Pretty unacceptable given they said it was in track to close within March as late as March 25. Will be curious to hear what they have to say. Sorry if you took any losses - my calls got obliterated"

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,If this doesnt happen I am so completely fucked
04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,Good question. I expect at least 2-3% this week but that could be towards the end of the week.

04/05/2021,wallstreetbets,why u say that
