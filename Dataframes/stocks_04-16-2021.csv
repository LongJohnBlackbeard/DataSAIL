2021-04-16 18:45:31,stocks,"Your gains will be taxed at your normal income AND the 10% penalty. There is no benefit from early withdrawing from your Roth vs just putting it in a taxable account. You also cannot go back and re-contribute the past years' contributions, you're losing the benefit of the retirement account compounding tax free."
2021-04-16 18:44:02,stocks,"Is it a first time home purchase? Or have you owned a home before?

There is an exception to allow you to avoid the penalty for a first time home purchase.

Regardless - I believe you will be taxed for not having the account open for five years [source](https://www.investopedia.com/roth-ira-withdrawal-rules-4769951). Scroll down to quick reference charts. 

Also - to your original post - I’d talk to a tax expert. It’s a 10% penalty in addition to taxes being paid for early withdrawals. What that tax rate is I don’t know. But as I said - if your account isn’t open for 5 years - you’re paying taxes regardless (I’m assuming the rule is design specifically for the purpose you’re outlining)

Also - it’s worth noting - that it’s extremely risky to put $200,000 for a down payment you need in three years into the stock market. Particularly when the S&P and NASDAQ are at or near all time highs. I’m not saying it’ll go down for sure - but I’m also saying in a short time frame (and 3 years is a short time frame in investing terms) - you have no clue what will happen.

Stick it in a high yield savings. Or a certificate of deposit. This isn’t money you can afford to lose if it’s your means for putting a down payment on a house."
2021-04-16 18:29:59,stocks,"The max co tribute amout you can contribute is limited to $6,000.00 per year.  You still have time to make a 2020 contribution before the May tax deadline so you can do $12k before the end of 2021."
2021-04-16 18:41:25,stocks,"I could be completely wrong, but if I remember correctly, if you are purchasing your first house and have had a Roth open for 5 years you can draw your money (not just what you’ve put in) without capital gains up to $10,000. You must draw from your contributions first, but after you can draw up to that limit. If it’s less than 5 years, then yes I think you have to pay capital gains so you kind of lose out of some of the benefit of the exemption."
2021-04-16 19:07:08,stocks,"To everyone, thanks for all your comments. 

Yes it will be my first time owning a home. 
And my Roth IRA has been open for over 5 years (2014). I have contributed each year."
2021-04-16 19:36:05,stocks,"Get a taxable account, you really shouldn't take money out a roth"
2021-04-16 18:31:41,stocks,"Got it. Thank you. 

But this is the way to go then right. Via Roth IRAs"
2021-04-16 19:36:54,stocks,I’m not bro. Going to take it out of my taxable individual stock account
2021-04-16 18:45:00,stocks,"Not really, the power of Roth is that it is tax free. When you withdraw it, it no longer has earning potential. Plus with a yearly limit once it’s past you can’t go back in time to put more in. Roth is the last place I would take money out from. Even then I might consider buying a less expensive house. Go the brokerage route for a house instead. Don’t cripple Roth’s power of tax free GROWTH"
2021-04-16 19:01:25,stocks,"1. you can withdraw your principle, but not your earnings above that amount. 

2. you can withdraw $10k without penalty as a first time home buyer. 

3. if you can't otherwise save for retirement, it's not a bad move. 

4. If you can afford to max out your Roth and save for a mortgage, don't use a Roth to ""stash"" money because it will limit your retirement potential."

2021-04-16 17:43:31,stocks,"Never heard of them. If im gonna play the online gambling angle, I'm just gonna go with DraftKings and/or PaySafe."
2021-04-16 19:27:56,stocks,"UK investor here. How many states have opened up to sports book gambling in the US now and how many are in the process of looking into it? I am out of the loop recently 

From my experience working in gambling companies, I know there was real excitement around the place when new Jersey was legalising it and a few big UK players tried to get in on the action.

I have been looking at draft Kings and paysafe like others mentioned but will take a look into this one too. Thanks for the heads up!

Are US sports books operators allowed to offer deals and incentives? Like new users get double deposit etc. If so, users are more likely to spread their betting across multiple companies to get the best offers on specific sporting events."
2021-04-16 19:16:18,stocks,"Why are they down 40% the last 3 months? I'm not being snarky I like gambling stocks, betz is my biggest holding and I also have rrr, byd, and evri and they have been doing great. RSI seems interesting but the rest of the market has basically doubled in the last year and they have been sorta stagnant."

2021-04-16 17:55:46,stocks,Fair enough. One of the reasons I’m liking this play so much is because of of discounted price to revenue multiple relative to DKNG.
2021-04-16 19:40:34,stocks,No reason. There has been nothing but good news. Lower volume and less known is a possible reason but it’s beyond me.

2021-04-16 16:42:14,stocks,"So essentially I'm getting 1.8381:1 APHA stock, assuming they merge?"
2021-04-16 17:54:32,stocks,"Good to know, thanks!"
2021-04-16 16:44:22,stocks,"0.8381:1 aphria stock, yes and they are going to merge, they had a shareholding voting for it and majority of people voted yes for the merge

So look at the price of both of them, there isn't much of a difference so best to go with tilray, if there was a big price difference then obviously picking aphria would be a better choice"
2021-04-16 16:47:42,stocks,"Right on, thank you"

2021-04-16 17:33:46,stocks,"Money is free right now, and eventually it’s going to cause inflation. Is it going to be a lot of inflation? I don’t know, but it doesn’t have to be. Higher inflation means higher interest rates, both makes it easier to repay debt. They understand that taking on debt now is a low risk play, with a high reward. So they borrow as much as they can. I would do the same if I could. Unfortunately I’m not rich enough."

2021-04-16 17:35:51,stocks,"Yeah, but why right now and in the span of a couple of days? Money has been free for quite some time now, so I dont see why banks are jumping on it all together.

2021-04-16 17:38:17,stocks,"In the past few months it has become increasingly obvious that nobody is going to stop printing money anytime soon, and things have stabilized a lot, so that makes the debt a lot safer.

2021-04-16 18:15:14,stocks,You bought the wrong things. High risk=high reward= high risk.
2021-04-16 16:00:20,stocks,"Even if you don't use stop losses, you should still have a stop price in your head, that you will sell at if it reaches. The worst thing you can do if you're trading (rather than investing) is not have an exit plan in case the stock moves against you."
2021-04-16 16:39:02,stocks,"I don’t know how you’ve been approaching losses, or if you’ve been swing trading, but if you’ve been following the “buy the dip” strategy you also need to know when to “sell the recovery” even if it’s below your cost basis. If you’re more interested in the trading game than just investing into safe bets then recovering any losses and putting that money back into a more profitable stock is key. 

You should also take profits where you can get them. Pick a % number and sell some shares when it hits that number, or if it hits it and starts going back down. 

On the other hand, you can’t really go wrong buying and holding it will just take longer and there’s less of a feeling that you’re gonna get rich tomorrow off of one big play."
2021-04-16 15:57:13,stocks,I never use stop losses unless I’m short selling
2021-04-16 18:56:03,stocks,"Man, it’s not a terrible idea to take “some” risk, but the majority of most people’s portfolios should be filled with things that have been proven to work.  And there are plenty of different options where that would apply."
2021-04-16 16:05:18,stocks,"Wow, that’s impressive, -50% in 4 months in a market that’s probably gone up +15% in that same 4 months? I’m not sure the problem is not using stop losses."
2021-04-16 15:56:50,stocks,"For a swing trade I always have an exit price in mind if it goes downhill, and will even raise it higher near market close if I feel bad vibes about the next 24 hours."
2021-04-16 16:10:42,stocks,"I never use stop loss on swing trades. Way to dangerous with volatile stocks. Set a Stop Loss in your head and sell if it reaches this certain point.

2021-04-16 15:54:35,stocks,Why are you so sure the stock won’t bounce back up?
2021-04-16 18:27:19,stocks,"Key word difference: trade vs invest

No need for stop losses if you invest. Just ride out the dips no matter how low and buy as you go down. As long as the company fundamentals haven’t changed for the reason you bought to begin with."
2021-04-16 16:20:49,stocks,I never use stop losses but I also don’t swing that way.
2021-04-16 16:37:03,stocks,Plenty of good comments here. Make sure you know the implications from the wash sale rule if you decide to sell and buy back in. That's hurt quite a few new investors.
2021-04-16 16:45:03,stocks,You should be able to lose 50% of your trades and still make money. Having a strategy is key and set it up for a 1 R loss and a 1.5 R win.  Lose 50% of your trades and still come out on top.
2021-04-16 18:13:39,stocks,"You can buy supports, recognise lateral channels (they last months, look at AMD) and 'read' the market, not the news.

Setting apart a value play from a swing play, if the first one jumps +30% that's the swing done, no reason to run on it for weeks. In a different manner, if a value stock jumps +-30% time to sit back and relax (maybe adding more, if justified)

I'd say anyone using stops must be dealing with short-term, even daytrading. If one thinks about it is not a great tool, setting a sure loss, often times recouped within days, to be executed automatically without monitoring the market at that precise moment."

2021-04-16 19:38:34,stocks,One way is to place stop losses wherever the trade conditions change for the worse(assuming you are using technicals??). Ths stop loss would go wherever the price action would suggest your signal wasn't right.
2021-04-16 15:54:59,stocks,Why don’t you want to use stops?

2021-04-16 15:18:56,stocks,"The difference between a corporate bond and a treasury bond is who is holding the debt. You are loaning that entity your money during the duration of the bond, and each entity will have a different creditworthiness. The yield of corporate bonds is tied to treasury bonds, since corporate bonds are slightly more risky (risk of default), so they’ll typically have a slight yield premium over the respective treasury bond duration. 

The three year treasury currently has a yield rate of .338% APR, which I don’t think would cover inflation during that duration. If you are interested in bonds I would wait till interest rates increase, as they are expected to in 2023, yields should increase substantially. For now, the equity market is really the only way you can make substantial returns."

2021-04-16 16:36:27,stocks,"I’m not seeing anything negative about AJX, just from a preliminary look. Medley I would stay away from, they filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy recently (March 2021). SAR also looks like it is an okay company by its financials (but it actually may be superior to invest in this companies equity, it is paying shareholders a 7% dividend)

You may also be looking at the coupon rate (what the bond was initially offered at) but it does not look too different from the current yields (AJXA’s yield is 7.12%)

Edit: The current ratio for AJX is .3, so it has quite a bit more current liabilities than current assets and could be at risk of default. It also has a substantial amount more debt than equity (x3)."

It was a time to batten down the hatches.  Expenses were cut wherever they could be found.  Projects were put on hiatus or pushed out into the future.  Capital expenditures was delayed.  Hiring was frozen and contractors let go.  Whatever.  With Covid winding up, those budget cuts are ending.  A five year PC replacement schedule and no or few upgrades for the past year means some businesses will be replacing forty percent of their PCs.  A four year schedule would mean half."

2021-04-16 19:44:10,stocks,"The real reason is that your broker needs to post collateral. The main job of a broker is to serve as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. If there is any doubt that one of the two parties will not be able to cover their obligations, then the broker is responsible for serving as the counterparty. In normal times, this is not a big deal since collateral is small but in times of volatility (especially the one saw intraday by GME), it is too risky for them and they don't allow trading of that particular stock. As the above poster mentioned, this is quite routine and literally happens every day with penny stocks.

It is not about the loss by one of the parties, it is about the counterparty risk. If a stock drops 50% but the broker can still find buyers and sellers, nothing happens. What happened is that the brokers could not find enough people quick enough to take the other side of the transactions.

Now... the GME crowd doesn't like this version so let's just go with the ""MaRKet Is riGGeD!"" version.

PS. For reference, [IBKR](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=3182), which is larger than Robinhood, has around $9B in equity capital. If one of their customers is unable to dish out $9B and IBKR is responsible, they go bankrupt."

2021-04-16 18:39:56,stocks,"Which is really BS if you ask me. Only the exchanges should have the power to stop trades, otherwise you get this fiasco where small to medium brokers + IBKR stopped buying(they cannot stop selling as that IS illegal)  but any client of the big/prime brokers can trade with no problems. Your fiduciary duties to the client should be your first priority."
2021-04-16 15:26:57,stocks,"I actually called TD and was told some of the smaller or less costly stocks got frozen because their movement was very large. for example, if NAKD was .3 and it went to .6 thats 50% and they can freeze any stock that moved that much against itself. So every up or down is relative to that stock. I guess it makes sense, but Ive seen stocks skyrocket well over their own value w/ no freeze. So i guess its 1) it moved a lot and 2) it was a reddit stock and thats what the dude at TD said. Lame from my point of view but whatever, thats the way it is."
2021-04-16 14:34:09,stocks,"Yea I agree. I guess I'm wondering if other (non-frozen) stocks caused the collateral requirement to drop but did NOT get frozen. Because that would go against their reasoning for the freeze. Because from my point of view, only reddit stocks got frozen, yet I'm sure not only reddit stocks caused the collateral requirement to be jeopardized. I am hoping to find some other large drops that occurred around that time that did not get frozen."
2021-04-16 14:44:35,stocks,I've come to notice that this particular sub has no real appreciation for talk of vertically challenged anything. My take on that is that's it's anybody's guess. At this point does anyone truly care ? I searched high and low regarding your question because it directly affected a Kartoon position I love to dislike at times. Notorious for its occasional P&D's. So I concluded that we made the list based strictly on history. Precieved notions or actual paranoia based on information they were privy to. Level playing field is not what we get in most cases. What they didn't know at the time was that a small cap wasn't going to be a big problem for them. Cause nobody was really paying them any attention. So you just have to consider the source and play on. Or not.
2021-04-16 14:40:02,stocks,"Everything is super short term so all gains are going to be short term capital gains (your ordinary income tax bracket). You can offset gains with your losses but only if you don’t get hit with wash sale status so keep that in mind. 

Obviously the goal is to not get too many losses but when you’re ultra short term anything can happen. I personally would advise against day trading because most people fail at it, but if you’re determined then best of luck."

2021-04-16 14:13:15,stocks,Depends on how large your portfolio is
2021-04-16 16:15:51,stocks,"All of these answers are in depth and great information, but to simplify it for you:

If your income tax rate is 30% then you need to aim to make AT LEAST 30% more of your gains on every trade to break even ie: if your gains are $100 then you need to make gains above $130 to keep the original $100....now add in the losses you can subtract (avoiding wash sale rules) and you have some profits to be had.

I day trade, so I make sure my exit point exceeds my tax rate otherwise I’m just wasting my time."

I don't live in the US, but I seriously doubt that's how your taxes work...

If you buy at 90 and sell at 100 you aren't going to pay 30 in tax, you'll pay 3. You don't need to exceed your tax rate."
2021-04-16 14:26:40,stocks,"yes, you will hold 0 positions overnight

2021-04-16 14:42:35,stocks,"Most day traders aim for a percentage of their working capital (cash) each day. Not uncommon for pro day traders to average 0.5-2% a day working off of a $100,000 account or more. The bigger the account balance  the better.

If you can you’ll want to start with an account greater than $30k (gets you safely above the $25k PDT rule) and then trade with small lots (1-10 shares) until you trade consistently. Once you can trade consistently you can scale up to bigger size."

2021-04-16 16:47:26,stocks,"Still, it doesn't make sense. ""30% more"" with respects to what? 

> if your gains are $100 then you need to make gains above $130 to keep the original $100

What? If your gains are $100 then they aren't $130 (and vice versa).

If your gains are $130 you wouldn't have $100 after tax, you'd have $91.

>I day trade, so I make sure my exit point exceeds my tax rate otherwise I’m just wasting my time.

Any profit would still make sense, tax can't turn a profit into a loss. It makes no sense to make sure your exit point exceeds your tax rate."
2021-04-16 14:37:20,stocks,It is the rate of whatever tax bracket you fall into. If you hold it for less than a year it basically is reported as additional income.
2021-04-16 16:49:29,stocks,"You’re missing the target range all day traders use. When I enter a trade my exit is at a gain amount of $xx so to maintain that amount you also need to compensate for tax loss increasing your target by the tax rate.

Most day traders use either a flat rate gain for an exit or a percentage, for myself I prefer the flat rate target. Do you day trade?  Or are you more casual?

But I do agree any profit is good profit, but to make a career out of it you need targets."
2021-04-16 14:38:42,stocks,"Ok. So the point being, as long as I don't hold the stock overnight, I don't get taxed in capital gains.. So glad I asked you guys."
2021-04-16 16:56:10,stocks,">When I enter a trade my exit is at a gain amount of $xx

Ok, in this case I understand your point about the tax rate."
2021-04-16 14:48:50,stocks,"😂😂😂 no. 

I don’t think you’re ready to try to be a day trader. 

You will be taxed on every gain you make. The time you hold before selling determines the tax bracket it’s taxed at. You also have to watch for rebuying too soon after a loss or you can’t write off your loss."
2021-04-16 16:58:08,stocks,"It really all depends on your preference in how you trade, I find the stability simplifies things and removes emotion so I’m satisfied with any loss or gain I make. FOMO is a difficult thing to edge out and having a strict policy really helps!"

2021-04-16 15:47:50,stocks,"You have no idea what you're talking about.  When COVID is over and people can go out again, will they stop using Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google, Amazon, etc.?

Yes COVID was a catalyst for the business just like it was for many businesses.  But people don't sit at home scrolling Pinterest because they can't go out.  They use Pinterest as part of their lifestyle.  I use it to collect recipes because I'm the cook in my family.  My wife uses it to collect hairstyles and other woman things.  Even my 18 y/o daughter has fallen in love with it.

The only issue at this point in time is valuation because they've issued a lot of stock, so it will take time to grow in to the valuation.  But the prospects for this company are huge.  Advertising is just the start, and advertising works on Pinterest way more effectively than it does on social media sites.  They have partnerships with Etsy and Shopify and that's just the beginning of the e-commerce side of the business."
2021-04-16 15:51:57,stocks,"Some research firm reported that Q1 growth ended slower than expected, but analysts have already incorporated expectations of slowing growth YoY.  No company that grew strongly during COVID will continue to grow at the rates they did during COVID.

2021-04-16 13:53:41,stocks,Yes it has. I would ease into it. Only buy a 1/4 or a 1/3 of your planned position to at least establish an entry. If it does continue to climb at least your in. If it immediately pulls back with some Profit taking then you can lower your cost basis. Which I do anticipate a pullback. Just don’t know when.

2021-04-16 13:34:25,stocks,"Using airlines as an example, sure business is starting to improve but a lot of them trade at valuations near pre-pandemic highs. And that’s after taking on significant debt. Same story with hotel operators, restaurants, etc. in some cases analysts have to use forecasted earnings from 2023 or even 2024 to explain current valuations. 

My take is, “value” plays aren’t so value anymore. Ironically, once everyone started rotating out of growth in droves, high quality growth names look to be better value. It’s my opinion that the market is slightly overvalued even considering the economic backdrop, stimulus, and rates. However, there are still pockets of value but you need to dig harder to find opportunities. 

Doesn’t change how I invest, but it’s good for me to understand context and how expected future returns could be."

2021-04-16 18:36:03,stocks,"I think alot of it has to do with people seeing stock prices higher than ever and thinking how are we not in bubble? If you look at the dot com crash the NASDAQ was around 150 pe compared to now it is around 40. I think a lot of it has to do with all the money that the government has been pumping into the market plus all the stimulus to people and businesses.

2021-04-16 14:06:43,stocks,"If market is perfectly health then how does one explain the current market PE? SP500 PE is at second highest from historical level. 

I'm not as smart as others but i do try to understand basics. Lets take P/E - price/earnings. A company generates earnings, historically the price of a share at 15 times earnings is considered fairly valued. A company which has aggresive growth, one can say PE of up to 25 is fairly valued, typically this is based on assumption that earnings will grow over time at a rate greater that established companies. 

When one looks at the market today, SP500 is at a PE of around 37, with most tech companies at or above PE of 40. Craziest is Telsa PE is at over 1100, thats like you invest $1100 and company makes $1. 

How do you explain these basic things if market is healthy ?"

2021-04-16 13:29:40,stocks,"Well in my opinion when this bubble really started is in 2018 crash and since then we have gone up 70% on s&p from , from the 1998 low to the 2000 top the s&p went up 50%. The 2000 bubble can clearly be seen on the nasdaq because that was where the bubble was concentrated. Now most of the extreme bubble stocks are not in an index but if they were I am sure that they would be up around 200%. You see things like hwin being worth 100m with 35k in sales or stuff like M A R A having a -240% profit margin. Or the rate of change in margin debt being the highest since 2000 and the s&p having 13/14 last days being green setting a new record, like all this signals extreme froth. On nearly all traditional metrics the market is overvalued expect the one everyone talks about tye fed balance sheet, and here why the argument that the fed will stop the market from collapsing is bullshit, its because it has nothing to do with the fed, people are taking on margin to buy stocks, they don't borrow from the fed, they borrow from the banks, and SLR has just ended meaning the banks hold less in capital, they will be forced to tighten their lending limits, if no more debt can be taken on then the bubble will burst. Look at the Chinese stock bubble of 2015, the similarities are uncanny, loads of new investors, record margin, easy money policies and this had the ultimate government support even on the way down the CCP blocked trading and tried everything to stop it, and it still popped. Now does this mean sell it all, no it dosnt. I am holding my longs and am hedged up, if you buy now in the long run you should be fine, however in my opinion there is clearly extreme froth in the market and we will correct quite a bit soon, and in my opinion anticipating that makes holding on during a crash and not panicking which is what you should be doing far easier.

Edit- you can even look at the nomura prime broker lending chart, this the part of the bank that lends money to people to buy stocks. You can see it speed up after the 2018 Xmas crash and go vertical after the election"

2021-04-16 19:41:00,stocks,"I get your point, but I think the market can be irrational sometimes.

I don’t think many investors go to the point of sifting through income statements and cash flows, they just see ‘airline is low now, covid is ending soon, will go up, I’m going to buy now’

Even I was guilty of this when I just started off investing, my first large stock market move was UAL, I bought in at $48 using that exact same thought process. I was shocked to say the least when I saw that their debt increased by 30.4% in 2020.

I’ve become wiser since then lol, always check out that information before you invest somewhere :)

It makes up 9.60% of my portfolio at the moment, but I haven’t sold a single share because I still fully believe that the stock will reach their pre-pandemic price when the sector opens again; if the re-opening plan goes as it should, I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw ~$80/share by the end of next year.

Why? Because the market is irrational like that. Once they see EPS being beat and money coming back in, they rush to the stock. If the market wasn’t irrational, value stocks wouldn’t exist."

There’s not a lot supporting energy’s run up so if demand is less than projected that could crash quickly. Not to mention for large companies that pay healthy dividends, dividend coverage from cash flow is not that great. Some payout ratios are above 100% so there are questions about sustainability.

We don't know if travel will immediately surge to record highs again or if we'll see a consistent 30% decline in flights for 5 years in a row compared to pre covid. The amount of debt they've gained since covid has definitely put them in a much worse position than they were in pre covid. 

IF travel does pick back up right away and stays strong for years to come air canada still won't be worth what it was pre covid simply due to all of the new debt. 

Also if I'm not mistaken they diluted shares so just from that they already won't be returning to their previous 40$ share price pre covid."

It’s a very very small percentage of very speculative investors that easily fall prey to unfounded trends. Those investors can make fun of “boomer” stocks all they want, but I’ll take being made fun of and not losing 30% any day. 

For instance, I started investing exactly two months ago (literally two days before the small correction started), my investments do include some speculative stuff (I.e. 15% in ARKs, almost 10% international growth, etc.), yet I’m up almost 1.6% overall. If this keeps up, I might reach my 10% per year goal since most of my dividends will come in December.

2021-04-16 17:43:20,stocks,"OP, don't sell. Growth stocks take time. 

I think banks, brick and mortar, and energy aren't ready for the disruption coming their way. They may actually be overvalued as such, and on a fundamental basis. Look at M -- case in point. The ones that will continue to gobble up market share -- fintech, ecommerce, clean energy -- are at steep discounts. My picks here are MOGO (especially with COIN IPO, it owns chunk of Coinsquare) and MAXN (manufacturer of best solar panels; spin off of SPWR). Run the numbers on their products, growth, quality, and it's the place to be right now. Short term pain, yes, for long term gain.

Did AMZN go up in a straight line? No. Will a name like recent IPO ABCL do that? No. But it's an awesome entry point right now. 

Earnings, partnerships, growth all coming together nicely. While the price is down 50 percent from highs. Absolute monster product in biotech already. 

That's just a (rather obscure) example. TIGR is another. Emerging market fintech growing like a weed internationally; IBRK owns a chunk.

FUBO is yet another. Hated on. But the most relied upon analyst who called ROKU has put a PT of 60 on it. Growth continues, fundamentally. ROKU was the same way in its price action -- look at its chart.

Growth stocks are by their nature speculative and high risk high reward. If you did your research and believe you've got a winner on your hand, add more. Time in the market is what matters, especially here. Average down. Be patient. Commission free trading means you can buy literally one share a day to average in.

Also own some boomer stocks that are undervalued. Preferably have growth in their future. There are many. GM has a low PE and has a big TAM to grow into with the direction it's heading (transportation as a service). I like VIAC now, too. Picks in CURE remain cheap. So called space stocks like GILT and MAXR are, too. Boomer semiconductor plays MRVL is, too. And growth stocks in leisure priced as value stocks: CWH, LAZY, HZO. Home builders are dirt cheap and in a secular growth trend -- ETF ITB could do you good there.

2021-04-16 17:27:53,stocks,"I own TSLA, PLTR and ARKG. I'm down around 5% on the year and +103% last year. 

Tesla is slightly in the green this year. Bought 3% into PLTR sub $24. And I'm down about 16% in ARKG from ATH, however it only accounts for 4% of my portfolio, not something crazy like 30%. 

Over half my portfolio is in total market funds. I do this because I know my high growth portfolio will incur more risk and volatility. I also buy to hold long term, I don't trade or do options. Boring I know. 

My main point here is have allocations you are comfortable with, which means understanding the downside and not just YOLO'ing into the next meme stock. 

That said, it's ok to own meme stocks if that's the label people want to paste on them. But you need to know why you own and have enough conviction to stick to your plan. I've owned Tesla for a few years now when it wasn't in favor so I couldn't care any less what others think about my investments. I'm the one that has to sleep at night and be good with my decisions."

Not everyone is playing swing trades and moving their money from tech to value all the time. He probably just bought a little high on some tech stocks but if he wasn't a dumbass and bought pumps, his portfolio will most likely be perfectly fine in the long run.

Even at slightly high valuation, a high growth tech stock is likely just going to go back there. It might simply take a little bit more time.

2021-04-16 15:43:21,stocks,"Dividends should be irrelevant to the investor holding the shares. It's more of a psychological effect than an economic benefit. In order to pay dividends, an entity must generate profit and cash-flows. The company can either choose to retain those profits on their book value or issue them to the stockholders. When they declare dividends, the market value of an entity decreases to account for the return of capital to shareholders. This is why dividend stocks tend to trade sideways. There is no capital appreciation because all earnings, profits, and cash-flows are being returned to the shareholders every year.

As a Tax CPA, I would even suggest that dividends are detrimental. Mind you, you mentioned a ROTH IRA account so this doesn't really impact you but still hear me out. On traditional taxable accounts, dividends are taxed at capital gains rates (ordinary rates if international). You will be assessed a tax, even if you reinvest those dividends. You would be much better off having the business retain that cash or give it back via buybacks. That way you only get taxed at a capital gain rate when you sell. You should be indifferent between a firm issuing $100M in dividends and the stock price remain constant and a firm not issuing a dividend but have its market value increase because it has retained its cash-flows.

What makes you say this? I am genuinely curious. If you truly believe that markets are irrational, specially in the long-term, feel free to publish your thesis. You might even get awarded a Nobel price for discrediting the whole field of modern finance. I think you might be confused about the [price-equals-value efficient market hypothesis.](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/insights/lessons-of-gamestop.html)

>If things were traded exactly by mathematics then you'd not have apple with a 2.25T market cap, or uber who loses money, with a market cap of 112B.

Markets trade based on expectations of the market participants. If more participants have a positive outlook than those having a negative outlook, prices will adjust accordingly and vice-versa. Only the future will determine who was right and who was wrong. But again, it is based on expectations. 

Expectations are subject to subjective biases. In other words, everyone has a different expectation. The fact that someone has a different expectation than you, does not make them irrational. This why I am hesitant to believe anyone who claims that a particular stock is either overvalued or undervalued based on their due diligence. Like...what discount rate did they used or what percentage of earnings growth was used to determine intrinsic value? There is no single universal method of quantifying intrinsic value; these are all subjective and differ from person to person.


>Human beings are there trading the stocks.

Correct. And they are subject to biases and create expectations. If their biases are very strong (like those from people in this sub recently), they are likely to generate expectations that not very reasonable or pragmatic. But rest assured that they are not irrational; the average person wants to make as much money as you do.

>The human beings know exactly by how much % the shares should drop due to dividends being paid out?

As explained in the above post, the answer is yes. When the officers of a company declare a $10B dividend, the market price will adjust accordingly because the entity no longer will have $10B to generate future cash-flows. The problem is that we do not know if and when those dividends will be declared. It is anybody's guess how much AT&T will declare in dividends next quarter. The minute that it is announced, the stock's price will adjust accordingly at the interaction of market participants."

2021-04-16 15:06:32,stocks,"I've been paying a lot of attention to them as well OP.  I have gone back and forth a bunch but currently sitting on the sidelines.  Bear says current financials are bad, real competition from other major players hasn't started yet, and have read a few negative anecdotal stories about their quality/service.  Bull says addressable market expanding rapidly, first move and market share advantages, products available for both homes and businesses, etc.  Seems likely to fall and test $20 support line, anything there or below I will likely jump in finally.  Believe as of right now chance of booming long outweighs the risk it will crap out instead.

Obviously with basically every car company pivoting to mostly electric vehicles in the near future the demand for charging stations will explode.  However, personally I think the battle for public charging stations will be much less important than the battle for private at home charging stations.  No one is going to want to have to wait 20 minutes for their car to charge at a station.  People will buy vehicles that can guarantee a full charge will get them through their normal driving day, then plug in when they get home every night so they can start each day with a full ""tank"" and never stop for ""gas"" again.

I don’t live in the United States, but from what I’ve seen no/very little state/local owned charging points exist (correct me if I’m wrong), and similarly in the UK everything is private charging points.

I feel like with the infrastructure ChargePoint already have, why would state/local governments go through all the hassle of sourcing and researching all of this stuff when someone has already done it for them?

In terms of the profitability, they charge for the electricity at a profit lol. Renewables are also starting to take hold, which have a high start-up cost (cost to actually set up the equipment to do it) but the actual cost to produce the electricity is nothing (wind turbines spin with the wind, solar works by itself etc), so who’s to say that CHPT might not create their own sources of renewable energy to power their own stations too?"

They sell electricity that is bought at wholesale rates at a very high markup OR I have been saved by free 6kw charging in parking lots, restaurants, shopping centers, etc. Businesses buy CHPT, in particular—don’t know why, but they are most often CHPT, anecdotally—to ‘lure/reward/virtue signal’. That’s three modes of business and EVs are a fractional part of transport (for now). Home charging boxes is probably the biggest potential market and they are the best, IMO, currently."

Many charging points (in the UK at least) have solar panels on the top. This is another way that energy can be produced, and I feel like that would reduce the demand on the grid, as some of the energy to power the point is already coming from the solar panel.

I’m sure that over time, we will find more solutions to solve that problem :)"

2021-04-16 16:57:40,stocks,"I get your point; here’s the thesis behind the comparison.

BP and Shell both mine and sell _oil and gas_. Why does that matter so much? Because oil and gas still dominate our world in the sense of energy generation. Without oil and gas, society probably can’t continue as it does now. We wouldn’t be able to produce sufficient electricity to power our homes, our workplaces, our schools etc.

This is exactly the reason why their market caps are so large. Because without companies like BP and Shell, we are completely and totally screwed.

That is all very open to change in the future. Over the years we have come to see the damaging effects that the mining and collection of oil and gas has to wildlife. Moreover, we can now see the effects that the burning of oil and gas has caused to our environment.

Sorry to sound like Greta Thunberg, but it will get to the point where the Earth becomes uninhabitable. That is why we are beginning to find new, cleaner and greener ways to create electricity that doesn’t damage our environment.

My point? Renewables and other cleaner ways of electricity production are set to take over in the near future. Countries are already attempting to reduce their reliance on oil and gas.

CHPT is the company that is already dominant in the field of electric car charging, and the prospect of electric cars is unarguably inevitable.

A new future is coming for the automotive industry, and CHPT are already getting ahead."
2021-04-16 17:11:50,stocks,"I completely understand and I am 100% all for a sustainable future. The EV revolution/bubble is here and here to stay until the next being clean hydrogen... clean EV as well because we need to pay attention to the full life cycle starting from generating electricity (large percentage is coal for now). All I am saying is we are talking about a charging station company. They don’t produce the electricity. They simply install these charging stations and maintain them for a fee and membership fee? So an upfront purchase and install price tag and maintenance? I just don’t completely get the business model living up to the stock price... for example, BLNK rising as a penny stock with no proof of profitability or investments in R&D. I completely understand the necessity for these given the future demand and projections (let’s not even talk about the demand and impact on electric grid), but it would make sense to me if power companies (which are majority public) install and maintain since they sell the electricity. Anyways, I’m just wary that’s all. Maybe it’s bc I got such a bad taste from BLNK that I now look at others as the same."
2021-04-16 17:23:45,stocks,"No, 100% get your point.

I think the way that the business model works in the UK may be different to where you are. In the UK, nearly every single charging point is privately owned. A business (like a restaurant for instance) can choose to have these points installed but will have to call a private company to do it for them. 

BLNK just isn’t the one to compare it to. Even though they do the exact same thing, BLNK is run by a man known for his pump and dump schemes who sold off hundreds of thousands of shares right at the peak. In addition to that, the company literally spent **NOTHING** in R&D of their product for an entire year. Just goes to show that the whole thing is a complete machination.

CHPT at ~$40/share? A bit overvalued for the current state of the company imo. At $20/share? I think it’s a potential winner.

Edit: The National Grid of the UK is completely and totally privatised. In fact, you can even buy shares in them on the London Stock Exchange."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"MGNI reporting Q1 earnings May 10 MGNI was a stock I got into into right before Thanksgiving after doing some research on good growth stocks for the first half of 2021. They are a sell-side advertising provider.

Supply/Sell Side Platforms connect advertisers to publishers to ensure advertising inventory is properly filled within the publishers available channels. This is normally used by publishers to gain access to advertisers. This is where MGNI operates.

This compares to Demand Side Platforms that are  is used by advertisers to find publishers.

The goal of these platforms is to ensure that advertising inventory is properly targeted towards the consumers who are viewing publisher channels.

An example of sell side would be an in-house advertising company like Apple who would use MGNI to find proper publishers to target their iPhone ads. An example of demand side would be Roku using TTD to fill commercials between free streamed videos. Before advertising platforms, advertisers and publishers would do direct sales, but this lead to inefficiencies in targeted audiences and scalability.

As stated, MGNI operates on the sell side. They primarily target advertisers and work to find the proper publishers for which the advertiser's ads will find a home. As on their website, one of their clients is Discovery Communications which uses MGNI to properly target ads for their product portfolio.

MGNI makes money by offering proper placement of ads and also tracking of their efficiency. From their 10k filing:
> We provide a full suite of tools for sellers to control their advertising business and protect the consumer viewing experience. These controls are particularly important to CTV sellers who need to ensure a TV-like viewing and advertising experience for consumers.
> Buyers leverage our platform to manage their advertising spending and reach their target audiences on brand-safe premium inventory, simplify order management and campaign tracking, obtain actionable insights into audiences for their advertising, and access impression-level purchasing from thousands of sellers. We believe that our scale, platform features, and omni-channel offering makes us an essential partner for buyers.

MGNI has seen a 150% gain in stock price since November based on positive momentum in their connected TV offering. 2020 was the first year they saw solid CTV growth and its a new revenue stream for them. This has allowed their revenue to increase by almost 50% between 2019 and 2020. CTV makes up 15% of all their revenue, Desktop makes 36% and Mobile makes 49%. All three segments are growing, with CTV being the top growth line. Their revenue in 2020 was $221M.

I believe the stock has rallied based on expected CTV revenue growth in the future. At a stock price of $40, MGNI has a market cap of $4.5Bn. This puts its P/S ratio at about 20. Not too egregious but definitely high. If they can maintain 50% revenue growth YoY, that P/S ratio falls to a much more paltry 13.

Their margins are  currently 66%, which is consistent YoY. The main reason they didn't post a profit in 2020 was due to increased sales/marketing cost, higher administrative cost and what seems to be a one time restructuring cost.

In their Q1 earnings, here's what you should be looking for:

- How close is the stock to $40? $40 seems to be a good place for MGNI leading into May 10. If its above $40, I would trim my position to manage risk. If its below $40, I would increase my position based on risk tolerance. I pick $40 because that sets a P/S ratio of 20, and is the midpoint and support level since the February annual report.

- With the shutdown of 3rd party cookie tracking by browser and endpoints, sell-side advertising tracking has become more critical to have effectively targeted ads. Magnite has been putting out good PR trying to focus on this macro trend.

- Growth of the CTV business. We should see CTV moving towards almost 30% of total revenue.


If we don't see revenues of approximately $80M, with CTV business making up $20M of that revenue, I think that MGNI will see a sell off.


Right now, MGNI is seeing overall downward pressure that's affecting all small/mid cap companies. Its hard to remain convicted when its eating 3% losses every day. If MGNI doesn't find support at $35, its falling all the way to $18 where it found support after the December short attack by Spruce Point Capital.

If earnings show another 50% QoQ or YoY growth rate in revenue, buoyed by strong CTV and 3rd party cookie demand, I could imagine MGNI going to $50 to maintain a P/S ratio of 20. Anything short of that, I see MGNI falling to $20 until next earnings."

&#x200B;

one of the reason in my opinion is that there s not much activity over there and the ""big boys"" which had a lot there are the main players. the short float is great as well and it has a small fee which not seem to be an issue. its seems to me that tecenilaty and the convience of to short this stock, because they way it is build just screwing the stock.

 i hope getting to phase 2 with some of the ideas like the recent  SFR617  will make it recover.

im staying in cause i dont see why should i put the money that i lost on the table and ran away, but every day it surprises me again with how much it can still go down. 

the funny thing that when ARK is heavly invested in it, and the analyst price are 15-16ish u feel it has maybe something waiting in the corner.

&#x200B;

some of you haven been in this stock, what do u think i should? accept the big L or keep waiting and ""hoping""."

2021-04-16 11:07:11,stocks,Small arbitrage opportunity but given fees in exchanging currency and such may be tough to take advantage and explain the difference
2021-04-16 11:16:53,stocks,As a rule the two would trade in step because of the share pool is the same float. Variances can occur but it is generally going to be USD/CND exchange rates that make up the difference. On stocks with lower volumes it can seem like a bigger variance at times due to lag between trades on the different exchanges. (Probably not the issue with shopify but does show up on others) Exchanges don't tend to register the trades on the other market so you only will see the price properly reflected on the next trade on the whichever market you are watching on. You can take advantage of this sometimes so always good to check...

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Why isn't there a lot of discussion about Siemens Energy? It seems like green energy, and really the energy industry everywhere, from fuel processing, to power generation, to transmission and distribution, grid stabilization, renewable grid integration, smart building applications, etc. are all hot topics on Reddit. I find it extremely odd there are hardly any mentions of one of the literal biggest and oldest players in this field - Siemens Energy.

It's like Reddit has a grudge against older established companies, and expects some new techy company to overtake them overnight. I really do not find this to be the case in this industry. For instance, a company like Siemens Energy has almost one hundred billion in backlog. Meaning, they have secure revenue streams for decades to come thanks to their long term service programs for their technologies. So again, I don't see them vanishing seemingly overnight because some young stud from california invents something they haven't. There's a good chance they might just buy it.

The company just spun off into the only ""pure play"" energy company in the world, traded publicly. Unlike their primary competition, GE, they are not in financially troubling times, and have plenty of cash to do what they are aiming to do - reimagine themselves as a pure green energy company. They are the only company offering **today** conversions of gas fired plants to hydrogen fire (eliminating emissions), offer one of the biggest batteries in the world (through Fluence technology), have the largest installed fleet of wind turbines worldwide (Siemens Gamesa), and are on the leading technical edge for smart building, infrastructure, and grid stabilization projects.

And yet...their stock price does hardly anything. Definitely did not benefit from the pump and dump nature other tech stocks have seen in the last 12 months. I just want to understand why?

Edit to answer some common questions: SMEGF is ticker. Other tickets as well OTC around the world as it’s primarily traded on German stock exchange."

They seem like a solid investment, when Tesla installed batteries to my states power grid they used Siemens products so they are in no danger of becoming obsolete at least. They just don't strike me as a company that would care all that much about stock prices, they're so firmly established in so many industries.

I'm an idiot when it comes to the stock market tbh, these are just some things I know about the company."

2021-04-16 13:53:05,stocks,"Large, established companies tend to diversify their operations across multiple segments, offer dividends, and are slow to adapt.  With this, their share price moves more slowly, especially when they offer dividends.  Smaller, more agile companies have more room to grow, and more quickly.  There's more to profit from young companies, IPOs, and startups, but with higher risk.

It's not that people here don't like established companies, it's just that the focus here tends to be on short- to mid-term gains.  Larger companies offer smaller but more reliable returns, which is what r/investing tends to cover.  This sub has a higher risk tolerance than what is covered in that sub.

For recent example check out QS.

Same report claims VW engineers are sceptical of QS but management buys into hype (and has what those engineers called ""tesla envy"").

Maybe it hasn't taken off because, idk,  fundamentals are fucked - well, everything about this investment thesis is fucked, particularly change in cash flows and timing? You're basically taking assets you own that offer the cheapest and cleanest way of generating electricity + shitting pure FCF every quarter.....and spending a fuckton of capex to retrofit them for hydrogen, which will likely shrink margins/EBITDA out into the long run while killing your near term value with a huge capex check you're going to have to cut (and likely incremental leverage since idk how tf else these guys would finance it).

Like, just running through the IRR math and cash flow timing in my head leads to an obvious drop in share price - it's literally a function of levered free cash flow out into infinity, discounted to present day, divided by FDSO. And this is without modeling any of this out in excel, just thinking about the pure cash flow delta implied by this notion.

Like, was any of that taken into consideration? Or do you think /r/stocks just knows so much more than the rest of the market that you can find low hanging arbitrage opportunities that the smart money hasn't already exploited? Not trying to be a dick, genuinely curious."

2021-04-16 17:09:10,stocks,"You realize cogeneration and tradition base loaded power plants are different markets, for instance? Plastic refining plants, for instance, make hydrogen as a byproduct. They also make their own power. Not every customer is positioned to take advantage of the conversion day one, and cash flow doesn’t change as most of their customers are locked into long term service agreements, much like a car engine has for replacement of parts and servicing. Burning hydrogen doesn’t stop this. But it does give existing customers the chance to upgrade their unit (from a going green perspective)

I really can’t take anything you said seriously because you made so many poor assumptions. Even calling the conversio “methane to hydrogen” isn’t accurate. Gas turbines don’t burn pure methane, although the compound is largely that. There are still far different heat rates, for instance, between natural gas and methane.

Also, yes, you were trying to be a dick. Why else would you say “like...” so many times lol.

Let me say it another way. Their customers pay for the conversion by buying new parts, actualizers for the hydrogen purification, and those parts need replacement just like the gas turbine parts. In no way do I see what you’re arguing here. From what I read you’re basically saying they are shooting themself in the foot for doing this. Crazy conclusion imo unless I’m misunderstanding you."

2021-04-16 19:23:59,stocks,"Stock was on everyones radar for a year before the pump kicked off, very often reposted with no visible effect what so ever. Heck even months before GME was even a thing there were times the sub reddit looked just like it looks today with its 10th GME post that day.

It was a disaster waiting to happen. It was so much naked shorted people thought there is a glitch in the system.

Afterwards they decide to send shorters after us, then slander us on media, it was them who shorted the stock tits deep and it was them that made it known to the whole fucking world. When the stock is almost impossible to borrow, but very easy to buy, in what fucking sense they would bring it to the worlds knowledge instead of keeping it silent ?

It was once a lifetime situation that was essentially made by them.

If reddit was ever moving the stock, not just hyping and riding the comfirmation bias, they would be capable of understanding and predicting the price movements, ever noticed stock goes up, down, sideways, nobody could predict it or even knows why ? 

There can even be cases where you can't find any bearish sentiment and non buyer in sight yet the stock still moves down, at some point you gotta use critical thinking. Everyone is just screeching something with their few shares while institutions can easely move millions of shares with no sweat.

Heck i even remember posts on wallstreetbets itself which analysed the numbers that GME movements was not possible by retail buyers and that big guys were the ones doing it all.

Reddit was hilariously great for taking all the credit, when most of reddit actually got burned on the stock, because it was flooded by 4 times more new comers than OGs ever were here and they all bought it at 300$ and higher.

Or just simply look at time horizon reddit is pumping something, and time horizons price is actually going up, you will notice there is no corelation between us fan girling over a stock and its actual movements.

Institutions some worth even trillions can yolo around starting from 200x more money than any of us single handedly needs to retire. We are not moving the price and never were, and that is with pretty small cap of 70 mil outstanding shares like GME.

People want to tell me we are moving companies that have bils of outstanding shares here. If that was even remotely true, everyones portfolio wouldn't be so slaughtered this year. 

I learned this lesson the hardest on peak r/pennystocks days, at some points that sub reddit and various 10+ discords had spam, hype and buying spree that rivaled the GME hype. Yet despites all the sentiment and actions, everyone could still get completely slaughtered and couldn't move even a fucking pennystock of all things.

Or even look at genius millionaire maker long term investments like Nokia, BlackBerry and Palantir which comes to mind, their price ain't doing that great.

Wouldn't it make more sense that reddit sentiment is just sometimes aligning with what stock does and sometimes not ? Reddit can for sure sometimes pin point really good investments that will rise largely, that doesn't mean it was the one moving it.

I would advice for new comers to take a week and study everything about stock  market from ground up. Otherwise most discussions is just people explaining to each others the basics, and mostly i see that nobody actually bothers to do even that anymore.

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"The New Normal - 25% of the S&P 100 companies are >70 RSI signaling ""overbought"" I typically watch the top 100 companies daily. I find it entertaining more than anything. I have the RSI indicator on my watchlist and 25 of these companies are currently glowing red. Home Depot and Lowes top the list at an RSI over 82.

The RSI indicator is my favorite tool and I usually rely on it for entering new positions. It isn't perfect but it will give you better odds of timing your entry/exit points correctly when applicable. If you are unfamiliar a RSI value over 70 is usually a sign that a stock is overbought (let it cool for a few days) and a RSI value under 30 is oversold (it probably won't stay here for much longer). Of course companies like TSLA and other momentum stocks break this indicator all the time. When it comes to the big companies though the RSI level is usually more accurate.

If you listen to or read any stock market advice prior to 2020 you would learn entering a position in a stock at these levels is usually not the best strategy. Yet many people are and new highs continue to get made. Home Depot crossed the RSI 70 mark around the $290/share price 3 weeks ago and sits at $328 today.

We see new high after new high and savings accounts are bloated across the US with cash. The new entry point is yesterday. As others have noted, anything a trader has learned over the years has been completely changed the last 12 months.

I continue to be cautious and constantly regret not putting more cash into the market a day earlier.

&#x200B;

EDIT: For clarity. I am not saying these companies won't go another 20 percent higher before a pullback! Or to an RSI 99! I am just stating it is something I have not seen in a long time. These are not speculative plays they are the largest stocks per market cap that our stock exchange has to offer. It is a very bullish sign obviously. I also see the index funds running at the same level. I am not a bear or a bull I am just trying to not get caught with my pants down! RSI works really well for swing trading but doesn't really matter if you are planning a long term hold. Good luck out there!

EDIT: If you want to know which companies here is the list. These aren't cherry picked they just happen to be in the S&P 100 (largest 100 companies) index $OEX. These are RSI 69.3 and up. The values move throughout the day. It was 25 of them over 70 at the time of the original post.

2021-04-16 12:43:54,stocks,"You are correct the RSI was over 70 at 2285/share on April 14th. This would tell me to hold off on entering a new position until it got closer to 50 which would have been May 1st at 2362/share. June 9th the RSI value was over 70 again at 2626. This would have been a successful swing trade over 5 weeks from 2362 to 2626. 

RSI only means something if you are looking for a short term hold. If it is going to be over a year then it really isn't much to be concerned about. I already noted Home Depot in my post and the run it has been on above RSI of 70 and specifically pointed out it is the ""new norm."" The whole point of the post was that anything that worked 12 months ago is fairly broken today. 

RSI is not worthless. Things can always go against it but it is of value. It is a great tool for swing trading. Many stocks will follow the RSI indicator from 70 to 30 and back again multiple times in a year. 

When COST went below 30 this year (even below 20) I bought and rode it all the way back up to RSI 70. Even though many people said the stock was overvalued I trusted the RSI indicator. 

I don't like technical analysis but MACD and RSI are really easy to glance at when making decisions. If they are in your favor they can help confirm your belief rather than following them blindly."
2021-04-16 15:35:52,stocks,">Take a look at AMZN chart from last year. RSI was 71.6 on April 14th. Overbought right? Should probably sell right?

That's because RSI being in overbought isn't really considered a bearish signal; The absolute highest RSI can possibly go is 100, but since stock prices don't have an upper limit, it can move into ""overbought"" while the price continues to climb. It's bearish when the RSI crosses *below* 70, not above."
2021-04-16 12:46:30,stocks,">..don't base your trades on things like RSI or you will miss out on huge profits.

I strongly agree that RSI is bullshit, but I do think TA has a time and place, and isn't useless, though MACD and RSI may be shitty indicators, things like support lines, trend lines, and SMA/EMA with crosses are pretty good at demonstrating market support points, resistance points, etc. Though I would also not base any type of claim of a market being overvalued on any of that, just use those as possible points of pull backs."
2021-04-16 13:01:21,stocks,"Mean reversion is not bullshit, and RSI is a good measurement of that.  Yes, you can find exceptions since a really good company can beat a 70 RSI and keep going up, but that's the exception to the rule."

GME was cool because it showed that retail investors can win at this game, too.  So big hedge funds like Melvin Capital can hope to multiply their wealth by shorting a dying firm into the ground, yeah?  But the people who are just trying to make ends meet working at a company like Gamestop or similar from 9-5 have no hope of ever participating in that kind of play.  And in fact they often see their very livelihood threatened by these hedge funds and other financial entities.

Take the case of 2008 for example.  Wall Street banks can profit off of unethical practices, normal people can't.  And when the music stops, not only do the Wall Street firms get bailed out, they also take down the whole Main Street economy with them.  

People are tired of Wall Street and the wealthy always having the upper hand.  They almost always win, and most of the time they win big.  When they don't win, they can't lose, because the government's there to bail them out.

My degree is in economics.  I know the bailout was necessary to save the economy.  But it doesn't change the fact that the common people are fed up with this dynamic.  They are fed up with it, and they have every reason in the world to be.  People's livelihoods were dramatically, dramatically effected by this sort of behavior.  

GME represented the first time that retail could win in a big way.  And even then, they didn't win.  Robinhood cut off the trading.  But still, it was a major breakthrough.  Average Joes showed that via social media the odds have been evened a bit.  Now it's not just hedge funds and mega financial entities that can win at these big plays... retailers have a shot, too.

Some people look at it is ""bringing the Hedgies down"", ""death to the 1%"", etc.  I'm not necessarily part of that crowd.  But no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, if you're a retail investor, just an Average Joe, you can be proud of what happened with GME.  It was a victory for us.  It meant a leveling of the playing field, if only ever so slightly.

I for one am happy that I profited on the long end of things.  I really believed in what I was doing, thus why I bought in on the way up the first time, and continued holding.  I had never invested in stocks before.  But I soon realized that the moment had passed, and that losing money wasn't much of a way to make a statement.  So on the way up the second time I cashed out and made small profits.

If you wanna short it, that's fine.  Like I said, you're not making much of a statement by losing money.  I for one wouldn't want to short it.  I really believed in that movement, no matter how small or insignificant my contribution was.  It may not have mattered in the grand scheme of things, but it mattered to *me*.

But still.  You wanna short it?  That's fine.  But the part about it ""making you sick"".  I think that's on you, man."

Interesting. Sounds like the stock market. Bitcoin was created in the year 2008 (technically early 2009) for a reason. The only thing crypto is really missing is overpaid suited-up talking heads on TV telling poor people to buy overpriced shit so that rich people can get richer before the next crash, which will wipe out the people that can least afford to lose their investments. A la 2008.

Crypto (like Doge) is just the stock market, without all the bullshit, and with far better gambling odds. Doge's valuation makes about as much sense as most of the S&P. And at least the financial security of 10s of millions of people aren't riding on Doge's valuation."

2021-04-16 12:31:59,stocks,"Builders are riding that momentum and striking that iron while it’s hot.  There’s definitely a lot of demand.  Seen a lot of new residential constructions from Single family homes to Apartment, Condos Townhomes."
2021-04-16 11:36:44,stocks,"Are steel studs more expensive than wood or only for commercial buildings? Why arent these being used more?

I've seen then frame out an entire condo building where they gutted an old paper factory and turned it into high end residential"
2021-04-16 12:39:46,stocks,This is just killing me. We desperately want to build a screened in porch/outdoor living space and the lumber prices just make it seem like a stupid thing to do right now.
2021-04-16 12:11:11,stocks,So this is why RFP is ripping today
2021-04-16 16:42:11,stocks,We on the verge of a boom like the 20’s but media butt fucks us into thinking the market is going to crash. I’m making 10’a of thousands on the fear mongering
2021-04-16 13:22:53,stocks,"Bought into $TOL (home builder) back in March of 2020 @ $14/share. A year later it’s sitting at $60/share. I wish I had told myself to buy more, I thought housing would bounce back but in no way did I see it exploding the way it did."
2021-04-16 12:06:43,stocks,Yeah don't get too excited. Housing has been soaring for the past year. Pricing is getting out of hand on many markets. My realtor has been saying we're in a bubble since last November. I wouldn't buy a home in this market.
2021-04-16 13:44:01,stocks,And mortgage applications are down 30% from their January peak lol. I wonder how this will end.
2021-04-16 12:39:43,stocks,"Nice. US housing should have huge room to run, still undervalued especially compared to many other major economies. Probably at least 50% more for the broad market before catching up to other major economies’ indicator for housing."

2021-04-16 18:26:28,stocks,Tons of new homes going up in my area of Illinois. The single family homes are running 500k plus. The condos and town house run 200k plus. With a property tax rate of 2.72% I am unsure just who is buying those homes.
2021-04-16 12:49:32,stocks,It's almost like the government keeping interest rates low and therefore housing prices high hurt the ordinary person.

2021-04-16 18:52:12,stocks,Any thoughts or concerns on JP Morgan (among other banks) being heavily leveraged in the housing market suddenly urgently raising 13b in bonds because they need liquidity for unspecified reasons?

2021-04-16 15:31:37,stocks,"new home construction in general is usually down in the winter months due to weather, depending on location but obviously when a decent portion of the market isnt doing anything its going to have effects on that entire market. the company im with now has 4 housing projects going on right now and almost nothing got done from December through most of February because it was too cold to dig to do anything. wasnt really until end of February/early March when we started getting some better weather that the subcontractors would get out there to dig and start doing work so this timing makes sense for the region im in. We are in northern Ohio and all of these projects are gonna be going for $400k-800k a house due to inflated material costs. its insane how much building materials are costing these days. also i dont think a majority of people realize how many hoops and yellow tape you have to get through with certain cities just to get a project off the ground. it can take literal years to get everything approved and figured out for a project"

2021-04-16 12:41:15,stocks,Its both but more on the supply side. A lot of Canadian mills shut down in 2019 due to low price of lumber and the tariffs. The current NA production capacity cant keep up with the demand right now.

2021-04-16 12:03:25,stocks,"We are in the process of building, and while the material cost was a deterrent the overall long term potential resale combined with a stupid low interest rate still made it a good decision.  We locked things in last November and prices on comparable lots, homes, and the materials going into it have skyrocketed even more since.  It's not a bad time to build, just need to make sure it's a home you're in for the long term so that if/when this corrects a bit the premium you paid doesn't hurt your gains from selling down the road.

This is our long term home, pending any career based needs to move, so we didn't hesitate too much even with higher construction costs."

2021-04-16 12:08:32,stocks,"Yes they are expensive.  They are also usually pre-cut, preformed, and are less user friendly to make adjustments.  Personally I think there is also a familiarity bias for home builders who have used wood for so long.

Metal framing actually works great actually in pre-fab homes, and I've seen from time to time builders switch to metal but the metal studs are more expensive than wood, and the metal goes up in price too."

It does not consider down the line renovation, or usual home owner use and tends to cause more problems than solutions in my opinion after working commercial and residential for 10 years.

2021-04-16 12:14:40,stocks,Yes. Its great. Investors were waiting to see if the Jan/Feb drop in starts was due to weather or slowing demand. The march numbers established it was the weather and the market (for now) is willing to absorb the elevated cost of lumber. A big indicator of continued earnings growth into q2/q3.

2021-04-16 12:09:44,stocks,"I wouldnt either. But housing construction hasn’t kept up with demand for over a decade. Prices will level out or correct, but the demand will still be there for awhile."
2021-04-16 12:47:26,stocks,"Canada basically had at least 20 year straight bull market, I think the only dip was a few percent at 2009. US overall had a big bear market for real estate and took a few years to recover. Chances are the broad US real estate market will have a massive bull market ahead. Really don’t think it’s gonna drop anytime soon when the rest of the world is still hitting all time high and already more expensive than the US.

You can go to the personalfinancecanada sub, Canadians basically gave up waiting for a real estate correction. They buy once they have enough for down payment."

2021-04-16 18:13:49,stocks,"Not quite at the 5 year high yet but getting close. But here’s some food for thought:

For context on RFP, 2018 eps was about 2$ for the year and lumber was~ 550$MBF for one quarter (tho pulp and paper were a latge prt of Q3 profits). The analysts projecting 4$ eps right now for 2021, with the assumption lumber falls off the cliff in July. Except July futures trading at 1167$ MBF today; November broke 1000$. So i have a feeling that 4$ eps getting a major upgrade. 

Lets conservatively assume they do 6$ eps for 2021. At the current price, thats a PE of 2.5. A PE of 5 at that EPS means a stock price pf 30. Btw, that doesnt even factor in the ~900 million dollars in deferred tax assets, and the 800 million valuation allowance (worth 10$ eps) sitting in the books waiting to be used. 

Think it’ll go past 15$...? ;)"

2021-04-16 11:37:33,stocks,Um. The entire frame of the house is wood.
2021-04-16 19:15:26,stocks,"Im not concerned with it at this point. I would need more info before it affects the calculus for me personally. The reason being 1) RFP still gets a large portion of income from wood pulp and paper which are also surging right now so they have a buffer/moat if housing takes a brief hit; 2) the housing demand will still be there and a market correction wont have a major impact on that demand. Lumber cash markets hit ~$1300 MBF today. Lets say market corrects and decreased demand causes the price of lumber to drop 30% from current cash price to $950 MBF and it sat there for all of 2022 while housing supply caught up to the demand. At that price, 2022 would be the best year in the lumber industry’s history, except for 2021. 

It really boils down to the sheer magnitude of the price jump, how long it has already stayed up, and the futures markets showing this will stay up into 2022. (Google cme lumber futures to see for yourself) even with a 10% market correction, that would barely put a dent in this historically mind-boggling wave of money flowing to the lumber companies and home construction supplies companies.

The reality is that housing was madly suppressed in 2020 with COVID and overall, out here in the western US there are inventory shortages in so many markets that housing pricing is WAY overpriced anyways. Once the moratorium ends come summer and more foreclosures happen, combined with a big increase in housing construction, there will be more inventory. Until then prices will only go up. But that has absolutely NOTHING to do with worker availability and housing quality, remember that unemployment is still high and people are looking for jobs, construction is an easy industry to get into as a person looking for work, that doesn't mean the quality of homes is going to drop off the map."

2021-04-16 13:20:35,stocks,"It's going to depend on your location and how you project population growth in the next decade. Here in Salt Lake City there is absolutely no reason to believe that the population growth will slow down, corporations are moving here due to the business friendly nature of the state legislature, populations are moving here because comparatively (when you look at other western US/west coast marketplaces) it's still cheaper and overall cost of living is lower, people are selling there houses in hugely overvalued markets along the west coast and buying more home for less here. Over the next 10 years there will be a very large population increase in Utah, it'll continue to rank near the top-5 in YoY growth and because of that there will be massive demand for housing here, so prices will not drop. Even if a ""bubble"" pops, prices won't drop as much as the 2008-2010 bubble because demand is going to remain so high here. 

&#x200B;

Now having said that, IF housing prices are being dictated by other industries (like lumber and raw materials) and those prices come down a lot in the coming year(s) then perhaps you see a housing price drop. How those industry to industry relations occur is outside my ability to foresee, it will be interesting to see how housing prices reflect things like the moratorium ending this summer. If foreclosures go up a lot will there be a pricing drop as inventory increases? Demand is so high in some markets those houses will be snatched up immediately, short sales of houses in even very poor shape will be instantaneous in some cases."

And cities love higher property value because they need the higher taxes to be able to hold their crumbling infrastructure together. Especially if they aren’t growing out more sprawl.

That's wading into potential city wide roving riots of people with quite literally nothing to lose, which will be much worse than the ones we're already seeing in some places. Honestly the best short term options here are either extending moratoriums until the job market fully recovers, or more stimulus. Longer term options will face unilateral republican and some democratic opposition, and / or are way too cost prohibitive / too far out to solve this current unique problem."

2021-04-16 15:06:50,stocks,"Forgive me if I'm wrong but if you want to live in a house for longer than 5 years what's the problem with overpaying $10,000 or $20,000? For a 30y loan It's about $40 extra on your mortgage for every $10,000 you spend. So overpaying $20,000 adds about $80 to your mortgage. If people are being foreclosed on because of that they have other problems, IMO.

Also, If you're selling a home you'll get the difference you overpaid on the back end."
2021-04-16 16:57:58,stocks,"This is, unfortunately, not going to happen. The people that have purchased mortgages this time have extremely good credit--this is not anything like 2008.

2021-04-16 18:35:44,stocks,"Lower interest rates absolutely means you can pay more for a house. For example, if you borrow 300k for 30 years at 4%, the monthly payment is $1432. If interest rates are 3%, that's literally the same monthly payment on borrowing 340k for 30 years."
2021-04-16 15:15:29,stocks,Yeah it’s going be to a mess
2021-04-16 15:18:12,stocks,Wtf? People who can overpay on a house and qualify for a mortgage won't have issues paying their mortgage. They can't even get a deferral so I'm not even sure what your point is.
2021-04-16 17:26:46,stocks,It is ok to overpay on a house if you are getting a good lower interest rate. Paying 20k more on a house is way better than paying 100k more over the life of the loan. Also you have to take into account that every dollar you spend on rent is gone. If your mortgage is anything close to your rent you are making money on those dollars compared to rent.
2021-04-16 14:20:16,stocks,Rising interest rates could impact demand though.
2021-04-16 15:30:23,stocks,Depending on the ratio of properties to buyers it may dramatically impact the price of real estate. There may even be a delay as the properties tend to be on the low income side and will be torn down for new construction.

What ends up happening? Landlords file for eviction, leading to a “hearing” months later. (Even with the memorandum many states are allowing this such as FL and NJ). 

If the tenant can’t prove loss of income, they still win. 

The hearing results in judge dropping late fees, utility’s, and landlord negotiating 1-3 months rent. Then a payment plan for 6-12 months for arrears."

2021-04-16 14:54:47,stocks,"Why do you want to refinance? What was your original rate? I'm going to guess you paid 5.00%. Traditional advice would advise against refinancing for rates under something like 6.50%. I'm not sure you can even refinance for under 100k. You could refinance to pull cash out. Do you need cash?

Assuming you put 20% down, your payment (off 5.00% and minus taxes and insurance) would be around $301. Also using those assumptions you should have about $45k left on your loan.

Do you like your house? Do you want to move? Theoretically you should have $190k~ (i've already subtracted realtor fees from this figure) in equity in your house for another down payment if you want to move. 

I don't think refinancing makes much sense for you unless you're trying to pull a bit of cash out in order to do something like make improvements to the home or pay down other debts. Refinancing to save you money will not save you that much money."

The stimulus payments were made sporadically and wouldn't even cover the average of 1 month of rent for most people who actually needed it. While yes they boosted federal unemployment and extended it, it didn't always translate into enough given that some states have stupid low unemployment payment amounts. Also what about folks who weren't eligible because they had to quit vs being let go because their child care suddenly disappeared?

I'm purchasing a 350k home on a 30y VA loan with no money down. The home is probably worth 320k or 330k. I plan on living there for at least 15 years. The lot is amazing and it's in my daughter's school district so we're happy. The payment should be about $1770 per month. If I got it it 330k it would have been $1690. If $80 extra a month kills me then I shouldn't be buying in the first place.

My current townhouse has about 40k in equity. I'm kind of hoping on a bidding war to get a little more. My realtor says there are NO houses available in my townhomes price range so she expects people to actually offer above appraised value.

2.	you’re conflating stimulus with financial assistance. The STIMULUS is to STIMULATE the economy, not cover rent. Rent is covered by UNEMPLOYMENT which varies by state, but is currently a minimum $2,400/month from the federal government alone. No one is expecting anyone to pay 18 months of rent and groceries on STIMULUS checks. That’s what unemployment was for.
3.	There will be an exceedingly small out of people that don’t qualify for federal or state aid under very rare circumstances, and there are some who overly benefited and made more at home than they did at their jobs. Almost everyone took a hit this year in some form or another, but many of us will have jobs to go to and restaurants to visit because of the actions taken by the feds. By in large, the government stepped up and helped the vast majority of people whether they needed to tap into the resources or not.


Not everyone will come out unscathed, but that wasn’t your measure. Your comment was that the feds can’t agree on lunch much less how to pay people and keep the economy going, but All evidence to the contrary. They’ve done a pretty fucking good job all things considered, and are in line or exceed what the rest of the world did for the citizens, including the afore mentioned Canadians.

If you buy a house for $100,000, and with interest the mortgage total is 110,000, once you pay 20,000, you have paid 10,000 off of the principle (the price of house). The bank is still owed 90,000, so you get the profits over that. If the value of the house increases, you profit more, if if decreases you could be underwater, which means that selling the house will still leave you owing the bank money 

(Very loose explanation with very simple numbers.)"

## BT's Openreach Seen as Key for Share-Price Recovery -- Market Talk

## April 16, 2021

BT Group has suffered falls in earnings, cash flows and share price over the last five years, but the downgrade cycle is behind it and now its Openreach network-infrastructure arm should drive a recovery, J.P.Morgan Cazenove says. Shares in the U.K. telecommunications group are up 50% from their October lows, but remain 70% below their 2016 peak, JPM Cazenove says. ""We feel a major re-rating requires BT to convince investors of the long-term upside from fibre. Given increasing \[private equity\] interest in telco infrastructure, one option would be for BT to monetize a stake in Openreach, and collateralize a stake with the pension fund,"" JPM Cazenove says. The brokerage raises its target price to 230 pence from 175 pence.

This comes on the heels of excellent bank earnings for Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, etc. thanks to record liquidity and savings.

Record revenue and earnings are likely products of a busy year of acquisitions in 2020, which included the purchase of e*trade and Eaton Vance.

As a part of a larger trend, MS looks to be undergoing a transformation, achieving most of their revenues through trading, asset/wealth management, and fees and commissions rather than investment banking and interest revenues.

Here are the key figures:

Earnings: $1.70 a share, 68% higher than a year earlier, according to Refinitiv

Revenue: $14.1 billion, 49% higher than a year earlier

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Wash Sale Question So I’m hyper worried about screwing myself on taxes and I think I understand a wash sale correctly, but I just need some reassurance.

The question: If I buy a share at 100.
The price drops to 90 so I buy another.

My cost basis is 95, and the stock comes up to 95. 

But I have reason to think it’s going to drop more before coming back up. So I sell my 2 shares at 95 and reinvest when it drops back down.

Is that going to make the first share ($100) considered a wash since I bought back in after the sale? Basically will the 2 share sale be a +$5 realized gain, or will that still be a +/-$0 when it comes tax time?"
2021-04-16 10:03:55,stocks,"Wash sales aren’t illegal, or even have an IRS penalty/fine associated with them — just different handling of loss vs. cost basis. I wouldn’t necessarily view it as “screwing yourself on taxes”. And if all these trades are in the same account the platform will keep track of it for you and report properly on your year-end tax forms.

Your hypothetical trades make a lot of sense in playing a volatile stock, in this era of frequent active trading, whereas the wash sale rules come from a previous era intended to prevent a specific year end behaviour, shame they haven’t been refined for modern times."

Let’s look at your scenario 
1. Buy 1@100 
2. Buy 1@90 - cost basis 190
3. Sell 2@90 - g/l -10
Now if you do nothing after that no wash sale here. 
If you buy it back next day when price dropped lower to 80
4. Buy 2@80 - cost basis 160
Now wash sale applies. You CANNOT report a loss for -10 on 2020 taxes. Instead you can only apply that -10 loss to your current position. Now your cost basis is 170 instead of 160. When you finally sell it
5. Sell 2@100 - g/l +30

The U.S. has just thrown a ton of supply and strong economic data at the bond market and it's had no impact. First it was the U.S. jobs report, then $120 billion of Treasury auctions, followed by consumer price inflation, and now retail sales. The 10-year yield slid to a one-month low.

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"To those who say low interest rates justify higher valuations... To those who say low interest rates justify higher valuations...

... you must also acknowledge that higher current valuations imply lower future returns. Assuming no change in expected future cash flows, which is implied by only citing lower rates as justification for current valuations, you are essentially “pulling forward” returns with a higher PV of cash flows (low discount rate). Equity returns boil down to the discount rate being applied to cash flows over time and the delta between expected cash flows and actual cash flows. Therefore, if cash flows are delivered as expected, equity returns will equate to the discount rate that was applied to those cash flows. Of course, if you have a view that future cash flows will outperform expectations, then there is an opportunity to earn above the implied discount rate.

Now, I am not making a case for the market being over/undervalued. I have just heard too many market “experts” use the low interest rate argument for why it’s a good time to be in equities without acknowledging the other side of the coin."
2021-04-16 08:43:10,stocks,"The experts aren’t just saying equities are a good place to be because of the low rates *right now*. They’re also saying that the expectation is for the risk-free rate to *remain* low for a lengthy period of time, meaning the relative valuation of equities will remain higher than alternatives for years to come. 

You make a good point about pulling forward cash flows. A lot of people seem to think that an over-valued market has to end in some kind of burst. That does not have to be the case at all. It could very easily just lead to a period of lower-than-average gains as company earnings grow into the valuations. 

As long as the Fed keeps the risk-free rate low, and signals that they intend to keep it that way for some time, equities are going to command a higher valuation. It will unwind at some point (either quickly or slowly), but not until the rate situation changes."

It fueled the bond market first then capital flows to other assets and lifted up asset prices across the board. As a result, market returns increased due to the M2 money supply expansion. Valuations of companies paid more focus on future cash flow growth prospects because at the current market return, non-growth companies cannot keep up. Right now it’s not so much the bulls that are balls deep in assets, but most economic sensitive investors feels an incredible need to be in assets. If one were to measure asset price elasticity of demand I’d suspect we’d be at the lowest in history of mankind."
2021-04-16 14:25:21,stocks,"Well of course.  That being said, that doesn't mean there's lack of room for growth.  A growth company with projected cagr of 60+ and 1 bln revenue in the next 5 years is very different than a company that's achieved that.

2021-04-16 12:18:15,stocks,"I've seen a lot of people say that this looks very similar to the 2000 bubble, but that's just far from the case. Take a look at how the Nasdaq 100 looked during 1999, for example. At the height of the dotcom bubble, the P/E was 189.7. To compare to now, the P/E ratio is 39.46 (as of March 31st). To bring us anywhere near the dotcom bubble, you'd either need the Nasdaq to rise 4.8 times the value it was on March 31st, or you'd need to see earnings take a big hit. P/E ratios certainly aren't low by any stretch, but a lot of this can be blamed on the pandemic, and I think a lot of companies will naturally grow as things open up, naturally lowering the P/E ratio."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"MAXN offering of $125M at $18/share https://finance.yahoo.com/news/maxeon-announces-pricing-public-offering-095500335.html

MAXN just priced their offering at $18 a share. That's 6.9M new shares, on a float of 13M and total of 30M. Thats a 23% dilution.

Also, that price point is some real management bullshittery, when MAXN was trading at $33 on April1 after the Biden infrastructure speech, and hit a peak of $52. Its as if the management always knew that MAXN was over valued, and priced the offering in line with their original split from SPWR price.

The revenue of MAXN in 2020 was 844M with a net loss of 144M.

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MAXN

Their revenue was down from 2019, but their net loss was lower too, mainly due to lower operating loss.

Their cash position is higher than in 2019, but with declining revenues this isn't really a compelling point.

I think there is also an intangible here. Even though the underlying numbers may look okay, the behaviour of the leadership sets a tone for the future of the company.

Lets start first with the slide. MAXN is an offshoot of SPWR. SPWR announced their earnings in February and they were not great. This caused SPWR, MAXN and ENPH to all slide because all three companies are tied together at the hip.

Since that slide, MAXN has done absolutely nothing to set investor expectations for the upcoming earnings. The stock slid from $52 at its peak down to $19 today when the offering was officially priced.

In that 6 week span, I'm certain that the leadership had known the underlying challenges to the company and its fair market value. Of course all is fair in business, but this behaviour does not give me confidence holding MAXN going forward as the leadership cannot be trusted to take care of their shareholders.

There was also a great post about this yesterday:
https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mrog5u/opinion_on_maxn/guno907/


At this point, I don't believe MAXN will recover from its price point. I actually see MAXN sliding back to $12 before coming back up. It may get back up to $22, but I don't see it return to its $30+ glory days without some major turn around. Their primary installation partner (SPWR) is seeing reduced outlook and revenue on installations. Analysts are downgrading their models for SPWR, and MAXN has just put up numbers to reinforce their bad position.

If you're looking for a solar infrastructure and manufacturing play, I think SEDG is a better bet at this point that is more predictable, reliable and seems to have better management at the helm.

What does everyone think about my reasoning?

Full disclosure: I am a MAXN bag holder with cost average of $32. I should have sold on April 1 after the Biden speech, but I got too exuberant and didn't set good stop losses."
2021-04-16 08:20:01,stocks,"I am a bagholder also, but I see light at the end of this stupid tunnel.

&#x200B;

Solar is the cheapest energy source to install now. Big companies are going for carbon neutral and some are focusing on making their own energy, not just getting green energy credit. MAXN gives the best solar panels as technology. Also they are not a Chinese company which I se it as a big advantage in an green infrastructure world.

I think the solar industry will keep going up just because it's cheaper than everything else and you can install solar panels over other structures (compared to wind). And I see MAXN as a possible big player."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Discovery Inc. DISCA DD & thoughts *Warning: I'm long shares and leaps of $DISCA so this post could be biased.*

Discovery Inc. recently got involved with a overleveraged Archegos fund which caused the stock to crash 50%+ as banks dumped shares. Some could make the case that the stock got artificially pushed up/ inflated.

However I see this as an opportunity to get in to a company earning **2B positive cashflow** every year and 10 billion of revenue vs Netflix's 23 B. They should have the cashflow to pay off their debt but still **15B in debt** is a lot so this is a downside.

The company currently operates in 220 countries  with over 300K hours of content, producing lots more every year. They own the Oprah show, animal planet , food network..

Comparing Discovery to Netflix makes a compelling case, valued at 5% of the market cap of Netflix (240B) vs (20B) and with a competing content offering with the goal to recreate the Netflix like- online subscriber business model justifies thinking about the possibility for decent returns on investment.

***CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels*** *in march 2020 : "" ""We really don't need a crazy number of subscribers to be operating a profitable business here.""*

May 10th they will anounce quarter results and have an investor call.

From looking at the app store, it seems people are really enjoying the Discovery+ app **4,9/5 stars** which would be a big concern if it wouldn't have a good reputation.

[App store review](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discovery-stream-tv-shows/id1498327873)

I don't see Discovery+ replacing Netflix or being the market leader. What I see is a certain group who do enjoy Discovery to also buy their subscription service.

&#x200B;

Netflix, HBOMax, Apple offer content which is uncomparable quality wise.

Discovery's is often something to just relax and watch, mellow content, background tv and can exist next to the other streaming giants for people wanting more variety.

Yes previous highs do not indicate that it would go back to them, however the rally started with discovery launching their Discovery+ model, you can clearly see that start January price took off and I believe for good reason as Discovery transforming their business model is actually a huge deal if succesful and that's what investors rallied towards. In the long term it all comes down to if Discovery+ would be getting lots of subscribers and create the revenue, market price should follow if they actually generate the $$$.

In February this year Discovery already had 11 million subscribers, exceeding wallstreet expectations, if they can keep this rate up I can see Discovery reaching 20M+ subs soon.

[11 million subscribers](https://www.nexttv.com/news/discovery-claims-vast-majority-of-its-11-million-ott-subscribers-belong-to-discovery-plus#:~:text=Since%20debuting%20%245%2Da%2Dmonth,5.2%20million%20subs%20in%20December)

Disney+ have over 100 million subscribers after 1,5 years.

\- If Discovery were to achieve 50M subs in 1,5 years (June 2023) I believe the company would be on the way to become a challenging streaming company.

As Discovery+ just launched mostly in Januari this year, i expect next earnings call to offer a lot more clarity to see how much there subscription base has grown and in what direction we can see the company moving.

Summary:

Disney streaming, Apple , Netflix, Amazon : I believe online streaming is the way of the future instead of cable TV, if Discovery can convert their business towards the new online subscription model I believe they have a good chance of winning a decent % of the streaming market due to their huge library of content.

&#x200B;

Curious to open the discussion and hear your guy's opinion / bear / bull cases.

Have a nice day."
2021-04-16 07:01:17,stocks,"I bought Discovery at the bottom and that was a mistake imo. Discovery entire bull thesis is reliant on D+ working out. But let's look at what it is about. They charge $5 for a ad lite experience and $7 a ad free experience. Honestly I have 0 expertise in this form of monetization,  but as a user this would turn me away from continuing any subscription. The idea of a paying customer having to pay more to avoid ads just doesn't seem to make sense to me. It would probably turn away people away from it.

But more than anything else the thing that turns me off from Discovery is the programs they have. What do you imagine discovery to be about? Science, nature, education and exploration if the wider world. What is it in reality? 

-90 Day Fiance and spinoffs
-American Monster
-Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations
-Barefoot Contessa
-Chopped
-Deadliest Catch
-Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives
-Disappeared
-Fixer Upper
-House Hunters
-Married at First Sight
-Planet Earth 
-The Pioneer Woman
-Property Brothers
-Say Yes to the Dress
-Sister Wives
-Super Soul Sunday

Other than Planet Earth everything else is a strong departure from what Discovery is about. Which of these would you pay $7 a month. Hell which of this would you pay $5 a month for? The shows they have are shows you watch when you got nothing on, not shows you would specifically pay for. In my opinion, unless D+ return to their biggest draw and what they are known for, I will steer clear. 

I think getting into this just because of the huge sell off was one of my biggest mistakes. But then again I am fucking stupid so take it as you will"
2021-04-16 15:18:14,stocks,"I’m not invested but this is a deep misunderstanding of what Discovery+ is about.

The combo of Food Network, HGTV, OWN and the new Magnolia Network is dominate amongst middle aged women.

I guarantee you that Joanna Gains is bringing in more money than Planet Earth."
2021-04-16 07:45:13,stocks,"Thanks for your comment :)   
Yeah I also think it is risky to invest trying to pick the bottom.. however if you believe Discovery+ will actually get more subscribers over the years buying the stock here at 40$ instead of 78$ a month ago doesn't seem too bad. 

People who pay 9$ for Netflix , pay for the ease of the app and ease to watch some movie / serie with a nice interface and smooth experience, it's all about D+ being able to copy them and create a decent experience. Their moat is the huge amount of content Disney+ , Netflix , .. does not have.

My bullcase in 2023: D+ has 50M subscribers paying 5$ a month = 3 B revenue purely from their streaming service. Not that crazy to expect as they currently have 11M.

If this plays out it's hard for me to think Discovery doesn't go along in mCap.

2021-04-16 07:59:23,stocks,"If you think back to netflix taking off, it was largely due to their library of exclusive content that was actually good. Disney+ has a large library for kids and nerds/marvel fans. Who does Discovery appeal to? Who will be attracted to be paying a monthly fee to watch Say Yes to the Dress?

Imo 2023 Discovery+ has 3million monthly users and the $78 was artificially inflated by the hedge funds, it was never worth that much and we are seeing Disca trading along pre pandemic prices"
2021-04-16 08:17:04,stocks,"How could they only have 3 million active monthly users when they had 11M in february?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

The Dow is approaching 37,000. spy 500. Your boomer uncle Randy is mocking you daily as his IBM, JP morgan, Honeywell, and Cheesecake factory play has doubled since Feb 2021. 

you look at your growth positions, now down 50% from february ATHs. Nio fizzling at 22, PLTR hovering around 15. TSLA struggling to break 600. WSB has reduced down to 3 million members, mostly bears. 

the growth run up in nov 2020-feb 2021 now just registers as a brief, mini spike in the grand scheme of stocks the past 1.5 years. You didn't buy the dip. you bought the falling knife off a mountain that was never climbed again. 

Giving up, you rotate all your plays into SPY, close your fidelity app, and vow to never trade individual stocks again. 

""This is the way"". ""This is the way"".  you mutter to yourself."

Though if the theories about a great deleveraging are correct, the pain in my positions like NIO, DM, KTOS, PLTR, GOEV, BB and NOK can continue till the end of the summer.  Not sure where to go from here."

2021-04-16 09:27:06,stocks,"The springtime meltup continues, led by big tech and FAANG. Anyone who bought those dips during the correction is riding high right now. What about the small/mid caps and speculative plays that got murdered and haven't recovered yet? My guess is that they'll eventually turnaround, too, once the large-cap companies become overbought again. Though this may take another month or so. As always, be patient."

2021-04-16 12:18:48,stocks,I’m confident in Chargepoint’s future but won’t lie that these past few months have been absolutely miserable to be apart of.  Averaging down daily it seems and almost at the point where it isn’t worth throwing more money at it until I see some sort of bounce.  It reversed back to the 30’s so fast and went right back to 20 just as quickly.

2021-04-16 18:03:32,stocks,"Everybody from the feds to the bears admits that the US economy will grow by at least 5% (some think 9%) this year. 

Company earning reports have been almost universally spectacular, producers literally can’t produce enough to meet demand, retailers can’t get enough to sell, consumers have more cash in the bank then they have had in decades, US vaccine deployment is incredible, and commodities are all up. Oh, and the fed is being fully supportive.

And we order you to bring us... a shrubbery made of money!

I am really liking the trend on NEE and not just because of the rebalance of ICLN, which will create some more buyers for that ETF and thus buy even more NEE shares.

-Florida's population is growing, and NEE is based out of FL

-Headed into the dreaded month of May, when people often sell off growth stocks and buy something more stable, like, say... a utility company that has upside.

-Solar power does better in summer. Don't think I need to explain that one. Demands for power in the south are WAY up during the summer. Everyone will want to get in ahead of those earnings.

-Green infrastructure is still a good play, and a company that actually turns a profit is an even better play even if it's not purely green energy.

We are no longer the Knights Who Say PLUG, we are now the Knights Who Say Eki Eki Eki Pshang Troopooloooo!"

I have about $8300 already in a brokerage account and was wondering if I should sell ~$6000, transfer it over, and buy the same stocks at what would be a higher average cost? Not sure if this would be better or worse due to tax implications (I'm in the bottommost bracket). All of it would be short-term capital gains because I only started last August. Thanks for any and all advice, I really appreciate it!

They do not contribute btw."

2021-04-16 06:14:11,stocks,"Branson still has 60+ million shares, and he didn’t sell the 5 million at an all time high, this could mean a few things... A. It’s not a pure money play, instead it was based on the schedule and need of his other investments. B. Selling at an ATH would cause more scandal and speculation/mistrust. Or C. It’s a play to benefit incoming traders for an upcoming flight.

Why I don’t think he is exiting a large percentage of his shares soon...because throwing away a space company would be detrimental to his other businesses and reputation, it would be shameful considering how close they are to some sort of success. Also, should it become apparent that VG will not be as fruitful as planned it could just be merged with another Virgin entity as a catalyst to push it forward.

Prediction: VG and VO will eventually merge or at least come close to, you heard it here first! 

RemindME! in 10 years “VG merger with VO”"

So say total with those 100 shares im up $1000.

The only way I can see it now is investing in the individual stocks listed, but given that I'd be trading on that stocks share price rather than the ETFs, it feels like I might not see the same return. For example, Tesla's is $738.85, but ARKQ is $85.05."

I am currently invested in EBS for 5+ years. Wether it moves down or up in the short term is irrevelant. What matters is the actual earnings reports there will be. If they are poor, even if the company went up in the short term, its irrelevant, because the earning reports will tank the stock.


If the company is down in the short term, also irrelevant. If they keep breaking earning records and have good news, it WILL go up eventually.


Short term movements doesn't matter if you are in for the long term. Its only scary because if tons of investors are selling out of it, it makes you wonder if you might have missed some sort of bad news (and that would matter!). Its essentially herd mentality. If you see other fellow EBS investors all selling out of their positions, it makes you think you may have made a mistake. And sure, it would be justified to double check if there isn't a bad news somewhere. But if you see nothing, its probably just the traders playing with the stock, which is irrelevant to us long term investors."

it's possible that a certain **dog** branded **e**-coin could be related as people looking for cash to blow into that, and pulling it out of many of the hyped up stocks that have been a little bit shaky as of late.

of course, if that is what's happening, it's a terrible idea because these unmentionable dog branded meme currencies aren't a solid investment and are just flavor of the week while the stocks that are selling off like PLTR, RKT, and EXPI have solid futures. this is definitely a ""buy the dip"" moment for anyone who has extra cash lying around.

If you are confident the stock will actually show profits some day, and you are patient, this actually isn't a big deal.

Personally I would doubt that, because large institutional investors are the ones that cause the vast majority of price movement, and of all the assets they could be putting money into I don't think a joke crypo is very high in their list.

Most of the meme stocks on Reddit are good short terms plays, but typically not great in the long term. So they jump up for a while, and then drop because the companies themselves usually aren't performing particularly strongly.

2021-04-16 10:24:52,stocks,"You are taking my reply totally out of context.

We are talking about selling some speculative stocks that are falling, to buy different, solid companies.

Since the market is at all time highs, can make sense to wait for a dip or correction before entering.

You tell what you think is the best alternative for the person I’m replying to. Keep his speculative plays and hope for a rebound? Sell them and buy better companies immediately at ATH?

The “don’t time the market” concept is sometimes applied poorly.

One reason is that it mostly applies if you buy indexes, not individual stocks.
If you invest in stocks, rotations are a form of timing, and widely used with profit. Hedge funds are an extreme example, but not the only one.
If you rode a security up to overvalued, let’s say Tesla, but could be Apple or anything, and the market is ripe for a correction and rotation, let’s say the eventual increase in interest rates, or the recent pattern of indexes, makes perfect sense to rotate to something that’s undervalued.

Also, some great investors don’t seem to believe in this concept of just buying the market regardless of valutations, even at ATH. Warren Buffett has long been sitting on a huge pile of cash, rather just buying an index.

The most prominent promoter of “not timing the market” sold index funds, and that’s where the concept best belongs.

Edit:
I also remember reading on Bloomberg last years of a small fund that achieved a 100% return in a few months, with a strategy they described being All in - All out. They probably were more sophisticated in their analysis of securities and market timing than the typical investor, of course."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"ICLN/ INRG Rebalancing - NZX extends trading hours for S&P Global Clean Energy changes Today's the day a lot of ICLN/ INRG owners have been looking forward to after a 20% - 30% drop since peaks in January following the Biden administration entering office.

Between the end of trading sessions on Friday April 16th 2021, and before the start of trading on Monday 19th April 2021, it is expected that Blackrock will rebalance their positions in ICLN/INRG in accordance to changes to thee S&P Global Clean Energy index to which they track.

This is starting to take place in New Zealand as trading hours are extended by 45 minutes to accommodate high volumes in both Meridian Energy and Contact Energy (both of which are seeing their weightings reduced). 

[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/nzx-extends-trading-hours-for-sp-global-index-change/2N4Q2ENY7W6TALMMRJBLWZ4XRM/](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/nzx-extends-trading-hours-for-sp-global-index-change/2N4Q2ENY7W6TALMMRJBLWZ4XRM/)

It is also expected that Plug Power, which drove much of the ETFs growth in 2020 (and demise in 2021 following a market correction and accounting errors), will see it's weighting gradually reduced. This will be of relief to many investors who are looking to bet on clean energy, but have been concerned by Plug's overweighting at \~10% of the index.

The restructuring will see the holdings of ICLN/INRG increase from \~30 to \~100, increasing it's diversity and it's stability. 

The rebalancing is likely to act as a watershed moment for the ETF which has been trading sideways since it bottomed out in March 2nd 2021 and is looking for a breakout opportunity. This morning INRG opened on the London Stock Exchange with a 2% gain in the first 90 minutes of trading.

It will be interesting to see how this ripples through the markets today, and how well positioned various active investors are to support existing price points. 

If the rest of the markets are anything like NZ, then it doesn't seem like there will be a huge crash but potentially a small gain in some of their prices become less sensitive to overseas passive investment changes/ Blackrock."

2021-04-16 18:37:05,stocks,but if it turns out in a week or 2 that plug starts rebounding hard then I think we will all be wishing the rebalancing could've occurred later
2021-04-16 05:00:54,stocks,"I would assume it's a combination of:  


* Generally being way too overvalued before and especially after the inauguration. Part of this driven by Blackrock's huge passive stake.
* The timely, and natural, market correction which saw a lot of overvalued companies reach more sensible valuations.
* Then the drop was exaggerated by the accounting errors, and a lot of new retail traders panic, or older traders profit taking whilst they could. 

You're right though, I wouldn't be surprised if some longer term holders took profit in anticipation for huge selling activity today so they could re-enter at a stronger price point. 

Plug's earnings in May will be a pivotal point as they need to prove that the accounting errors are not long lasting, and clear some of the air around various lawsuits in progress. Assuming this is well, then I'd be bullish at this price."
2021-04-16 14:24:43,stocks,"They haven't been winding down per se. Ya, the weight has gone down, but they've actually been increasing their position slightly. I imagine what they'll do is possibly sell some of their holding, but I don't think they'll dump anything more than 1 million shares"
2021-04-16 14:22:40,stocks,"Risky play. Plug has a lot of strength around the 25-30 zone. It may push below that if accounting errors are bad, but I doubt such a fall will happen. I'll be watching its movement over the next week or so myself."
2021-04-16 16:50:42,stocks,"Yeah, I'd like to see what makes ICLN noticeably better than, say, QCLN or PBW."
2021-04-16 10:15:47,stocks,"As far as I'm aware, this kind of rebalancing is extremely rare and there aren't many case studies to draw upon.

The rebalance will bring more stability to the ETF by placing less emphasis on companies like Plug. For example, over the past week INRG (London's equivalent) has been trading strong on open (+2% per day). However, when US markets open at 14:30GMT, INRG tanks to -2% due to Plug sell-offs. 

Why dies this happen?

Volatility in Plug's price massively shifts the ETF's price. Therefore, if Plug drops significantly, and an investor wants to pull out of the ETF, then they also pull out of all it's other holdings. These other holdings are fairly illiquid and Blackrock are major shareholders (this is why NZ needed to extend trading). This means that it's hard for Blackrock to get good price points (not many buyers) and can cause lots of volatility to the price of these holdings. Due to the popularity of green tech recently (following the inauguration), it's accelerated Blackrock's % share ownership exponentially in it's holdings which has made the markets even more illiquid - hence why S&P are expanding the clean energy index, which enables Blackrock to spread their assets further and reduce volatility.

This should provide comfort to a lot of investors who have been concerned about this for months, and it will make the ETF (and it's holdings) more attractive as a long-term hold (as they are less exposed to Plug). This volatility on a day to day basis isn't healthy for an ETF (or it's holdings), so reducing the impact of a few names is a great thing.

Personally, I would expect stabilisation and strong growth as 2021 goes on. Next week may be a bit wobbly as we begin to see what the details of the rebalance look like and whether there are still any left-over positions Blackrock need to close/ open."
2021-04-16 06:28:41,stocks,"It's not actively managed, so ""they"" didn't actively buy lots of Plug shares. The total number of Plug shares has gone up in the ETF consistently since before December (well before the rebalancing news broke). This can be driven by two reasons:

1. More participants in the fund, mean they buy more shares on behalf of the investors.
2. As it follows S&P Global Energy Index, the relatively greater fall in other holdings compared to Plug, can result in more Plug shares being purchased as its relative market cap is grows greater when compared to the other 29 holdings. But this is usually automated, and not usually done by a human."
2021-04-16 12:00:10,stocks,They never actively added more plug shares. Plug shares went up because more people bought icln so they bought more plug and other shares with that new money.
2021-04-16 09:51:11,stocks,"At a high level this would be a reasonable way to think. But in reality, it completely depends on how they are implementing the rebalance which is unclear!

2021-04-16 10:41:36,stocks,"Thank you so much for that answer! I'm in this ETF for a long term hold (speaking 20/30 years) so it's nice to hear that it will be more stable and attractive for long term holds.

I'm just curious why the emphasis on Plug was so big in the first place. When the ""downfall"" of plug began earlier this year, it was due to a few different factors as I understood it. And not insignificant ones. So why would Blackrock not so this rebalancing earlier or even sell all their shares of Plug. I mean, if they do their DD regularly on their holdings (I guess they do that? Everyone always talks about doing ones own DD) they must have realized Plug is in a bad spot atm. Or is that exactly what happened and it just took a few months since it's a big company and a lot of money?"
2021-04-16 18:12:39,stocks,"If thats how you sleep better at night you can keep telling yourself that. On April 5th they bought 454,000 shares of PLUG the scam company. Meanwhile they decreased their positions in CIG and NOVA two of the few profitable clean energy companies they hold in the ETF. This ETF is a complete scam."

2021-04-16 17:48:57,stocks,"Idk about PBW, but QCLN does have some holdings globally, although yeah, they mostly have exposure to the US by far. I believe that ICLN also is mostly the US, but they have a lot more international tickers as well.

I guess it's a compelling reason though to choose ICLN over these other clean energy ETFs. After all, the US has been falling as a global superpower, and while it's a long, gradual fall, one should not invest in a clean energy ETF unless they plan to hold for long, at which point I suppose the US's fall will have a non-negligible impact on one's gains."
2021-04-16 10:52:35,stocks,"Because the ETF was designed to **passively** follow the S&P Global Clean Energy Index **which means its holdings**. This is not an actively managed ETF. They usually slightly rebalance back towards the S&P Clean Energy Index twice a year as most of the trades are automated so a few deviations happen.

It's got little to do with the fund managers opinion, as it's not actively traded...

The only reason it's rebalancing significantly today is because the S&P Clean Energy index is changing its definitions as to what is/isn't included and capping the weighting of any particular company. INRG/ICLN is **forced** to do the same, they aren't choosing to.

No offence, but if anything, it sounds like you haven't done your DD on what this ETF even is and what's it's fundamental objective is."

2021-04-16 10:04:35,stocks,Growth stocks tend to grow a lot more than dividend growth stocks. Dividend growth stocks just growth more slowly and steadily. While growth stocks tend to rapidly increase over a short period of time but they are more risky than dividend growth stocks. People buy them because they are relatively safe and already have an established business. Their share price increases and they increase their dividend payout every quarter. They are also really good to own during times when the market is weak.

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Small amount to invest, single company share or multiple shares of ETF that holds the company? TLDR at the bottom.

I want to put $300 I've managed to save up into my IRA before I inadvertently spend it. I've always enjoyed tracking the market but haven't done so for years due to just being busy with regular work, however this recent market craziness is pulling me back in. 

I've been eyeing two companies specifically, Microsoft (MSFT) and Insulet (PODD). I like Microsoft because of their recent efforts at diversifying their income streams and investments and I became familiar with Insulet from a previous employer and I like their insulin pump equipment and approach. 

The thing is an individual share of either of these companies would take up a substantial portion of the $300. Should I take the risk and go in on one share of one company? Or search for a lower cost per share ETF that has relatively good exposure to these companies like EDOC for Insulet?

I know it's a small amount compared to how much others trade but I'm looking at this as a starting point for how I'll approach my investments moving forward so it's a big decision for me. Try stock picking and chase higher gains? Or try to diversify for some security?

For context, I'm in my 30's so retirement is far away and have reasonably good risk tolerance as the IRA is a buy and hold account. However I've been burned many many times by my stock picking activities and have lost some self confidence. 

Any of your experienced and skilled advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

TLDR: With a very small pot of cash ($300) in a long term buy and hold account, better to buy one expensive company share or multiple shares of company-holding ETF?"

If you did ""buy to open"" you have the option but no compulsion to buy those shares at strike price till Jan 2023.
Let's say you did ""buy to open""
If the stock goes to $10,000 from $900 your option value is going to skyrocket.
You can exercise the call or ""Sell to close"". If you sell to close, you will likely make a lot of money. if you sell to close you have no connection to the contract(s). Someone else can do whatever they want. At this point it's as if you never had the contract, you just are a lot richer now. This price action of a stock going from $900 to $10,000 in 2 years in extremely unlikely so please read more about the options in general before you put your money.
If you ""Sell to open"" you are allowing someone the option to buy shares at 900 by the expiration of Jan 2023 but you will get the premium upfront. Here if you don't have underlying shares, you could lose a lot of money if it goes to 10,000.
You can ""Buy to close"" and you will likely have to pay a lot to close as the option value will have gone up a lot.
If you don't buy to close and come expiration date the underlying is at 10,000, you might have to buy 100 shares at 10,000/each and then sell them to the buyer of the option at $900/each
So read up about covered calls before you sell a call.

What’s important is the distinction between „reselling“ and writing an option. 

If you resell (like you probably will) you‘ll first buy the call (+1 call in your portfolio) and then sell it later (-1 call in your portfolio). That means at the end, you have 0 calls in your portfolio. 

If you write a call, you don’t have one in your portfolio before, so you only sell (-1 call in your portfolio). It will show up as -1 and you will also have the responsibilities associated with it."

Started with $200k in paper, here are some examples: Risky/gambling—I’ve been printing money selling far OTM naked calls on GME lately, I’m up $40k after recouping my initial $20k loss. 

Conservative/realistic: Bought 100 shares of WMT on 3/3 at $128.44 and have been selling CCs at $142+ and I’m +$1k since.

Paper money is giving me all sorts of learning opportunities in a hands-on environment so I’m loving it!

2021-04-16 12:35:48,stocks,much different company back then.  BMY was not the powerhouse it is today.
2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Benchmarking performance and the impact of taxes This is one of those ""lesson's learned"" posts which I'm putting up as a form of catharsis but also the hope that others can learn from my experiences.

The two biggest thing I've learned over the past 4 months of trading:

1. Everyone feels like a trading genius when the entire market is booming

2. Benchmarking performance sets a real world expectation for your actions

For #1, its self explanatory. In February I felt like the whole stock market thing was super easy. Just dump in money, wait for it to double and you're a trading genius. I thought the gravy train would never end, and I thought stocks only go up and stay up. Well, as we all know that is not the case. I got too confident and exuberant, and instead of setting stop losses or price targets or goals, I just let my entire portfolio ride in individual stocks. The market corrected and cratered from February 16 on wards. And to this day, even though VOO and QQQ are back up 10% from their March lows, my portfolio keeps losing money day after day because I didn't manage risk appropriately. Big lesson learned.

The more important thing to share though is how do you measure your performance as a trader/investor, identified in #2. This is very critical because active trading, and even active investing, requires mind share, mental commitment and resources. Additionally, if you're very active in your investing you'll also get hit with tax implications. All this stuff should be considered into the overall performance of your portfolio. Here's my personal experience and journey that I hope folks can learn from.

If I had taken my entire portfolio value on October 30 and just bought VOO with every last dollar, my performance for year to date would be 30% returns. Not bad for a low cost passive index fund.

Instead what I did was buy and sell stocks thinking I could be smarter than the aggregate market. My swing trades got me over confident since the performance of the stocks I was picking was incredible, and my short term holds ended up becoming long term investments because of my over confidence. I didn't have good set out exit points, so I would buy and just wait for the stock to go up. And as long as it was going up I kept holding. At one point, my portfolio was up 90% from October 30th levels, trading at a 60% return over VOO. I thought I was the smartest investor ever. Then February hit, then March hit, the April hit, and now my portfolio is actually trading at 2% below VOO levels. Everything always reverts to the mean. And I don't think the fuckfest is over, as EV and green tech is still undergoing a brutal correction.

The bigger thing to think about is now this: I have a bunch of individual stocks for which I don't have conviction. I never intended to hold them long, but I didn't manage risk appropriately to sell them. And EVEN IF I had sold them at their peak, at 90% gains, the tax man gonna come and clobber me for short term capital gains. That could be as low as 22% or as high as 38%.

So if I had 90% gains, and I got taxed at 24%, then my gains are actually 68%. Still better than VOO, but not as good before. But here is the big rub. Selling those stocks would have been a good move but as they started to correct to the mean, I held them thinking that they would return back to their original levels. I never sold, and I kept holding and holding. And during this entire time, I NEVER COMPARED TO MY BENCHMARK!

What I should have been doing is keeping a mental tally of when my account value would be equivalent to VOO performance with tax implications. And for me that would have occurred when my portfolio was at 45% gains. At 45% gains, I could have liquidated my account, paid the tax man, and been no worst off than if I had put my money into VOO and just held.

Well, I'm well below that at this point. My performance compared to VOO is now at a 2% loss, and even if i liquidate I'll still have the tax man to pay so I'm doing worst off over all. 

All that for the hours I spent researching trends, finding tickers, watching my profile every day. Easily 10 hours a week of work messing with my portfolio. Thats 10 hours a week for almost 5 months that I could have back if I had just bought VOO and forgotten about it.

What has all this taught me? Three big lessons:

1. Depending on your temperament and mental health, passive investing may be way better off than active investing. Also, factor in whether you're good at investing/trading. I realized I am not. I need to practice way more with smaller amounts of money before I make the jump from passive investing into active investing.

2. Finding stocks and buying them is only one piece of the puzzle. Another much more important piece is risk management, exit strategies and stop losses. Unless you are an investor, where you will buy and hold a stock forever, every entry needs to be timed with a mental exit. I failed at this so hard and I need to take a step back to reevaluate why I was so bad at this.

3. Always be benchmarking! Compare your portfolio's performance again S&P500 against 1month, 3 months, 6months and 12months. How are you doing? What decisions are you making that are paying off? Calculate your portfolio's internal Beta! My portfolio's beta was about 3 before the correction. After the correction my portfolio has a beta of -0.5. Thats a really hard pill to digest, but its super important to know how your portfolio moves compared to the market.


To anyone who actually read this wall of text, I hope it provided you some lessons that avoid the mistakes I made. I'm sure people will read this and reply with distasteful messages into this post. The important thing to know about all this is that investing is a long term game and strategy. Having one bad year should be a big learning experiencing. Go back and retest your strategies and learn from them. Take a step back and play with less money. Lean on index funds in the mean time to avoid the crush of inflation. Once you've honed a reliable strategy, then start to increase the amount of money with which you're playing."
2021-04-16 00:02:00,stocks,"The lesson you learned is suspicious similar to one I learned several years ago... VOO saved me these last few weeks. It's about 40% of my portfolio.

I also compare myself to the S&P (and I rarely win btw)... But I wouldn't sell my holdings once I hit the same YTD gains as the S&P because then I might as well just chuck all my funds into VOO and avoid the stress. But I have about 25-30% of my portfolio that I like to play around with riskier plays.

As time goes on, I rarely hold for shorter than a year because short term SUCKS. It's like losing money then getting slapped in the face later on when you see that you'd have made more if you held. It's so often a double-whammy."
2021-04-16 11:48:39,stocks,"My saving grace is that I don't need the money and didn't YOLO every last penny into the stock market thinking that I was some sort of genius.

I'm normally not a gambler and avoid casinos at every turn, but somehow got caught up in the stock market greed when I saw my family/friends making $$$$.

Good news is that I've learned a lot as well. Next time, I will definitely not over leverage into small cap/penny stocks and look out for market recovery/trend reversal instead of just endlessly averaging down on crap....or learn to cut loss when the tide is turning.

I've lost all of my profits the last 4 months+ down 10k of unrealized  losses. And I still have taxes to pay for short term gains.

The other good news is that my retirement is entirely  in index funds (VSTAX)...Even when 'gamblers' told me how much I could be making (haha), I didn't touch my retirement money....so assuming status quo, I can retire in 20-30 years living a simple life.  :)

All in all: Always remember....Easy come, easy go."
2021-04-16 00:30:33,stocks,"All excellent points, thanks for taking the time to write this all out.

I'm as brutally down as anyone else with green tech, though I invested because I would rather my money help solve the climate crisis than sit in a bank. So while losses hurt, if my shares help retain market cap for a company that is using it to acquire more for R&D and to expand, then it's worth it."
2021-04-16 01:53:22,stocks,"I appreciate you writing this! It is all the content I feel at the moment and would advise others as well if asked about it, but not ever written out. I bet many of us can be awesome mentors to a new trader, but we never vocalize our lessons/journey , so you doing so is very helpful!"
2021-04-16 03:08:44,stocks,I have about 200 reopwning stocks leff to sell then converting that to VOO or VTI and SCHD and some dividend stocks
2021-04-16 11:42:25,stocks,"Yes it is a valuable lesson and unfortunately it’s one of those lesson each person have to experience the consequences before they get it.  Taking a portfolio approach is boring and time consuming and requires what most of lack...discipline

A few years back I implemented a rule where stocks does not go above 10% of my portfolio. Benchmark against MSCI world. I would set my allocation with 90% funds and ETF then only 10 with stocks to enhance the returns. I would rebalance twice a year. Both portfolio and mental state both stabilized after that."
2021-04-16 16:20:53,stocks,"You need temperament, conviction and risk management. I buy something when I know with 75% confidence it should go up and if it goes down I would have a mental idea of where the bottom should be."
2021-04-16 12:10:23,stocks,"I feel like an idiot because when my portfolio bounced back on March 15, I should have taken that as a chance to move a big chunk to VOO and hold only conviction stocks. But I got exuberant again. I felt like I was making the same mistakes all over again from March 26th onwards. Very disappointed in myself.

I really have no option now than to just hold and hope I can match VOO close enough to liquidate and consolidate.

I'm starting to agree with you short term. But in conjunction, I learned another big lesson which is when a stock you believe in goes up really fast really quickly, its not bad selling and taking some gains off the table. Just move those gains in VOO, and let the stock settle. Its a bit more active, but it prevents big random drawdowns. Obviously, its super hard to time the top, so this strategy may not actually be easy to implement."
2021-04-16 12:17:57,stocks,"> I've lost all of my profits the last 4 months+ down 10k of unrealized gains. And I still have taxes to pay for short term gains.

I'm REALLY close to that. I'm still up for 2020, but I feel like my portfolio is super dicey right now.

What are you doing to mentally deal with the drawdown? I'm struggling with gambling fallacy where I believe I can just make it back by yolo'ing into weekly SPY call/puts. But I also know this is a stupid idea and will probably cause me to go to zero. I should probably be more patient and try to rebuild my losses in slowly. Easy come/easy go. I 100% agree with you."
2021-04-16 11:02:54,stocks,200 individual stocks? Jeez
2021-04-16 12:14:55,stocks,"I 100% agree that you have to experience it before you can learn from it. Some people are better learners than others. I'm a slow learner, and I'm still very emotional a trader. I'm trying to get better about it.

Luckily, I have 70% of my equities portfolio in indexes. But I feel like I need to do a much better job of managing risk.

Thanks for sharing your portfolio allocation. It gives me a good target to aim."
2021-04-16 16:29:13,stocks,Exactly! And then you probably reevalute what was wrong with your assessment of why it went down and whether you were right with your assumptions.
2021-04-16 13:15:20,stocks,"I mentally deal with it by knowing that I didn't put all of my eggs in one basket. I still have a safe and SECURED retirement that I can rely on to live comfortably on (assuming no market crash or needing to withdraw from it for any reason) in 20-30 years.

I'm not living paycheck to paycheck and can hence wait it out for now for more favorable trends in the future.

Also, most of my losses currently are because I tried to 'REVENGE trade' so tread carefully...LOL. Don't pile losses on top of more losses without a way out. ;)"

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"market correlations/metrics you want on demand?  

Some background: Basically, I’m working on an application that allows any trader the ability to lookup a whole host of market related questions that would be otherwise tedious to calculate by hand. 

For example, on the simpler end, I have already created a database with questions like what’s the correlation between stock x/stock y, or any equity for that matter. On a slightly more challenging level, questions like how does AAPL perform historically when GOOGL beats earnings? Similar ideas but with options or futures can be implemented as well. In addition, I can add questions for a number of different momentum indicators and different metrics that some of you might use but have to spend time calculating by hand. 

Basically, when you are trading, do you ever find yourself wishing you could more easily access some correlation between events or any other metric?

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Wish, improved delivery.. Never used their service, but believe that any online shopping service, it's future depends on it's ability to ship quickly and cheaply. Read and article on NY Times about them setting up agreements with local shops so one can collect their purchase and even immediately buy some of the more popular products from the locations.

It is a website that is famous for selling cheap knockoffs, so the quality of their products isn't an issue for me, if you paying a dollar for something that usually costs ten dollars, shouldn't be complaining.

In short, what's people opinions on Wish. More specifically hoping to get opinions from people that use it often and if the pick up delivery from local store is something you view as positive and would make it more likely to order again from them.

Have no position in wish currently."

or cheaply, they just used to partner with cheap companies in China to give people cheap crap. Making partnerships with local shops is interesting but why would people go pick their shit up when the point of ecommerce is to have your shit show up at your door? It’s like when Amazon decides it needs to open up a brick and mortar shop where people can just pick up their goods. That’s called shopping homie."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"10 year treasury yield and inflation, what else holind the market back? In last February, the market crushed (we can argue about market  correction or whatever you call it) because of two things, the 10 year  treasury yield and inflation were rising. In last few weeks, the 10-year  yields have been decliing and today it hit 1.57. On the others hand, we  haven't seen any notable evidence of inflation becoming a wild big  issue. I wonder what else is holinding the growth stock back?"

2021-04-15 23:56:57,stocks,"My running theory now given what I’ve seen over the past few weeks is just that the yolo call fever has been worked out of the system, you’ll have to get a better explanation elsewhere but the general idea is that the more calls that are bought usually will translate into more shares being bought, with the stock going up.

I think what you’ve seen is a mix of people starting to do other things as we go back to normal and the innovative tech beating burning out others.

I’ve said that innovative tech was brutalized so badly that it’ll need more time than NDX/.IXIC did, but it really just might not happen at all for the rest of 2021. If the market can continue, there have been a lot of hints that it will be somewhat like 2017 of late."

Markets go through cycles.  Money managers have to rebalance portfolios to keep them in line with what they promised in their prospectus.  I know some like to see wall street as a bunch of fat cats playing the little guy but in reality it's like a pond full of fish.

Rick Santelli is just insufferable.

For actual business news, I highly recommend Bloomberg. You get the occasional nincompoop in there too but the interviews are much better and they actually let their guests speak.

CNBC analysts have been incorrectly predicting higher interest rates and inflation for like 4 months now. Like....who are you going to believe, Jay Powell and an army of 500+ economists with PhDs who work at the Fed and are literally telling you that inflation is only temporary and rates will not increase until 2023 or the clueless analyst on CNBC? Month after month new data is coming and people somehow act surprised about what Jay Powell said 7 months ago.

Many investors will probably be approaching the 3D printing company's report with cautious optimism. The company's performance last year was a mixed bag relative to Wall Street's quarterly revenue and earnings estimates. Its performance improved notably in the second half of last year, which helped to drive up the stock price.

In 2020, 3D Systems faced challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, as did most companies that have large customer bases in the industrial sector. Pandemic-related tailwinds in the company's industrial segment will likely continue into 2021. 

Investors should be prepared for volatility. 3D Systems stock often makes big moves up or down following the company's release of quarterly results. As to the stock, in 2021, it's up 119% through April 13. The S&P 500 has returned 10.7% over this period.

2021-04-15 22:09:52,stocks,"Expenses were much higher than expected, trading revenues exceeded by less than other big banks (and less than expected with the market volatility), loan growth was much weaker than expected, and RoE is lower than competitors so release of the reserves they set aside last year works less than it would at competitors.

The one bright spot in the earnings was the massive increase in ibanking revenues (underwriting especially), but that is likely a shorter term revenue stream that may normalize.

Banks often trade as a cohort and relative to one-another (putting aside macroeconomic factors), and BAC had by far the worst earnings of all the big banks this quarter (MS is still outstanding but based on Goldman's earnings, I expect them to do well)."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Small Cap Investing I’ve done fairly well over the years with a buy and hold strategy of high quality company’s. As you’d expect, most of my holdings are large cap tech stocks. I tend to rely on ETFs for diversity to add in small/mid-cap as well as specific regions and/or industries. 

Recently, I decided to take a stab at picking individual small cap stocks as they WERE on fire. Have been following Jonah Lupton from Lupton Capital on Twitter and subscribe to his substack. I like the DD he does and provides pretty solid write-ups. I do my own DD on the companies he writes up and ultimately have invested in 3-4 companies I learned about from him. Needless to say, this all started prior to the recent sell-off in small caps. 

I was wondering if anyone here has any nuggets to share on small cap investing, whether sources for ideas, research, etc. Jonah’s stuff is good, but he focuses his attention on a few specific industries and looking to add more sources. Or should I just revert back to my large cap focus and let the ETFs handle the small caps???"

Not attacking him at all, but genuinely curious, because I don't follow anyone when it comes to stock suggestions.

&#x200B;

That being said, I do own MWK,which I see is one of his recommendations, but I have long gotten my capital back on that investment and am just riding on 'free' money at this point and I agree that once their acquisition starts it should realise it's value, despite their debt being at 8% interest being a bit high, this is probably a hold for years if they succeed to continue going YoY revenue, which is expected to be at 300+m now, excluding any new acquisitions. I have never really checked the performance of my holdings for a while except for the occasional peek because 80% of my funds are in a global ETF IWDA/EIMI and VWRA (which I'm looking to start buying more instead of my previous allocation to IWDA/EIMI as it covers about the same aspects, and these ETFs have been doing very well so my daily  P/L isn't significantly moving on a daily basis for me to care."

You might be in the cement industry, and suddenly orders pick up. You can see things better. The one thing I want everybody who is buying individual stocks to get is that they have to understand the story, the five reasons something is going to go right for the company. If you can’t convince an 8-year-old why you own this thing, you probably shouldn’t own it. Don’t invest in a company before you look at the financials. If you made it through fifth grade, you can handle the math. "".

I was telling him I was investing in stuff like ARKG, JNJ, JPM, ALLY, etc. to diversify away from tech and e-comm.

His response was that, if I didn't at least give a cursory glance to the companies financials, profit statements, projections, competitors, etc., that I was trading on hype.

I realized he was right.  Like...I bought ARKG because ""Genomics"".  Do I know jack shit about genomics?  Do I know that it's going to be a big industry, outside of what I read on reddit?  Am I pretty certain that I at least like the stocks in the ETF?  No.  I'm buying purely on hype.

2021-04-16 02:15:54,stocks,"This is why a recommended strategy is to start with something like VT or VTI.  That way you start out with a position that is 100% diversified either across the entire US stock market (VTI) or internationally (VT).   Or as I do which is VTI+VXUS which is even better diversified than VT.    And you can explain any of these funds to an 8-year-old (It's a single ""stock"" you can buy which owns all of the other stocks).

After that, you can add a few stocks that you are fully comfortable with.  

But I fully agree, a lot of purchases are hype.  I've bought into a few over the years and have typically not been all that happy with their performance as I am with others that I've personally picked.  

I've also found that the best way for me to pick individual stocks is to start with brands I trust and respect and interact with regularly and have positive interactions with them whenever I do.  Then take a look at their financials to make sure they aren't circling the drain, although what I've found is that treating customers right is a pretty reliable indicator as to whether your finances will be in good shape or not."

I think the way people react with NIO shows why there's inevitably going to be a huge crash in most of the EV startups in the future. Everyone insists every EV startup is the next Tesla, without looking into what made Tesla become the success they are today. Not to mention they don't ask if the market conditions that allowed Tesla to become what it is today are even still there for other EV startups. It took well over a decade of R&D for Tesla to become what they are today, EV startups today don't have that kind of time, the auto market isn't complacent today like it was when Tesla entered it. If your EV startup wants to become the next Tesla they need to stand out from Tesla and the legacy automakers."

Their government is far more centralized and capable of the large scale infrastructure changes required to transition their population to EV over the next 30-50 years, and any company run well in the sector should stand to gain from it.

They're not the chinese TSLA, and I don't need them to be. They're probably overvalued at the moment, so I'll wait for them to come back to Earth before buying more, but I think they stand to be strong long-term holds.

2021-04-16 15:41:58,stocks,"Playing short and long are definitely two different games:

Long is typically based on financial conditions over the long term.  I.E. if you're buying a wide-market ETF you're more worried about how the entire financial system is doing over the long term.  Or if you're buying a stock, you're worried more about whether the company is being managed well and whether it has a future.

Short is, in my opinion, mostly about hype.   If you can buy the hype before other people notice and then get out just as the hype is dying out you can make a lot of money.   Some of the hype is real, some of it is just marketing, and some of it doesn't matter.  And to someone who is trying for the short game, what type it is doesn't matter since all you're trying to do is to figure out things that make the stock move over the next week or two, before everyone else, and then buy or short, and then close your position all at the right time. 

Most of the daily movement in the market is this hype.   You'll see it go up and down and up and down and up and down.   Yet underneath it all is long-term sustained growth that can be harvested using appropriate long-term tools like broad-market index funds.   To long-term investors, one doesn't really care what the market does from day today.   Loses 5%?  Who cares, it will be back at an all-time high in another few weeks.   Recession level event?  Who cares, it will be back at an all-time high in a year or so.   

A big mistake I see done over and over again is to buy a 'hype' stock and then assume it's going to do well over years and years.   Hype is just that - short-term, and maybe real, and maybe not.   If you can make money off of the hype, that's great, but it's also a great way to lose money."

Hence why China is focusing on their economic impact in the Middle East. They don’t actually pay for the oil shipped to them due to the fact countries like Iran and Egypt buy things from China. It makes it almost even trades. This is also why China is gaining footholds across the Middle East. There’s more than 4,000 Chinese-state-owned businesses in the Middle East and that number is increasing, in fact in many areas of the Middle East there’s “Chinatowns” where it’s just thousands of Chinese people living there. Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised to see China eventually taking over some oil or getting it for free due to their growing economic control as well as their plans to build massive high tech infrastructure in these countries such as their plans to rebuild Syria and Iraq or “Saudi Vision.” So while sure they’re a net importer, they’ve built trust and allies in the Middle East and are supporting them economically as well as buying out middle eastern businesses to expand Chinese control. 


> Their government is far more centralized and capable of the large scale infrastructure changes required to transition their population to EV over the next 30-50 years, and any company run well in the sector should stand to gain from it.


Over 30-50 years? That’ll happen naturally more than likely leaving China with no benefit."

2021-04-16 08:09:14,stocks,"Woah woah woah cowboy. Before you get your panties in a twist - I don't give two shits about NIO either way. It's just some other company to me.

Walk me through how NIO plans to implement battery swap technology. Compare that footprint to Tesla's SuperCharging network and how reproducible it is or isn't.

* What will NIO do if a battery swap doesn't work? Will they send someone out? How long will the stall be out? Do you just leave your car there and they bring you a loaner?
* How many battery swap stalls will there be and how much will they cost? Where will they put them? What's the physical footprint of the stalls? 
* How long will a battery swap take? 15 minutes? Why not just plug your car in at a Supercharger or similar?
* What happens if one of these NIO battery swap stations gets very busy? How will they continuously swap out the batteries? 
* Will they only swap out the batteries if they are fully charged? If not, what if you show up and there aren't any fully charged batteries? How long will you wait?
* If NIO charges the batteries very fast, why even swap them out?
* Does NIO have the capital to build out 5,000-10,000 locations? 
* etc. 

You can think through these questions easily enough to see that swapping out the batteries won't work and doesn't make sense. NIO already knows this and is working on increased range marketing over swapping out the batteries. 

> You're using logistics like it actually means anything.

I'm using it like the word means. Logistics. Building shit. Figuring shit out. How customers will use the infrastructure."
2021-04-16 11:51:40,stocks,"For wide scale adoption it requires all manufacturers to use a common battery pack design. This alone kills the plan as BMW and VW have flat out refused so it will end up being a NIO only scheme.  

The cars themselves end up being much heavier and more expensive as in most EVs the battery pack is a structural component, making it removable means reinforcing the chassis so the car doesn't warp when you remove it.

The plan also cannot last long term, think how many varieties of battery each station would have to carry to cater for older vehicle models. It would balloon to absurdity very quickly. 

Growth is also massively curtailed as to break into new markets you need to set up this battery swapping tech nationwide. If you don't the car you sell is basically gimped by being build around a service you cannot use.  

The reality is you could build it but the car you sell will be expensive, complex, tied to some battery swapping service that will no doubt be expensive itself etc and in the end will not compete against an EV from the likes of VW that you just plug in to charge."
2021-04-16 10:55:08,stocks,"Just because they made it doesn't mean it's profitable. Just because it's more convenient for the customer doesn't mean it's profitable.  Installing battery swapping and even super charging stations cost money. That's debt.

The rich didn't get stimulus payments; instead they got the stimulus payments of millions of people through the over-valuation of the entire stock market.

And who will pay for it? The middle class and poor will pay through stagflation and the devaluation of the dollar.

2021-04-16 08:21:27,stocks,"Battery swap takes 3 minutes, faster than Tesla’s supercharger. There is a set number of batteries that can be swapped in a day, since each swap takes time. NIO can swap batteries on more than 300 vehicles per day, and since the Tesla Supercharger takes around 5, they can fit even less than that. If you're talking about a malfunction, I would assume that the same thing happens when any other thing gets broken. Someone goes to fix it. The CEO says that 500 swap stations will be installed this year, and that's a conservative number. It's like a gas station or a supercharger. When there's someone using it, you wait. You're making a mistake in thinking that the supercharger is faster than NIOs battery swap is, it's not."

2021-04-16 07:54:42,stocks,"I'm very doubtful about their battery swap system. Battery is the limiting factor and the most expensive part for EVs so, by having these swap stations, they will both increase overhead and slow their scaling process. Also, battery technology is improving very quickly which means their stock will rapidly depressiate and fall behind."
2021-04-16 08:26:36,stocks,"I really don't see a path forward on these swap stations even if you could do it instantly. Far too much infrastructure footprint and marginal benefits for faster swapping. With an EV it's not the speed of charging that's the only issue, it's charging infrastructure availability. 

The swap stations will also have a difficult time scaling if NIO achieves any sort of demand. Not to mention, the vast majority of EVs are going the plug-and-charge route, so it's like building your own infrastructure for your own cars, except it's small scale and you're competing with everyone else.

NIO already recognizes this. That's why they are marketing increased range for the vehicles."
2021-04-16 12:20:37,stocks,"Most high-growth tech startups eventually fail eventually - and the questions raised above seem to throw a lot of cold water on the battery swapping tech.

If not I would say you are playing in the hottest sector of the past year which every new investor piles into because ""duh ... EV is the future"". The internet was indeed the future in 1998, but how many of the leading companies at that time are still the sector leaders? How many actually still exist?"
2021-04-16 12:20:47,stocks,"I'm really only considering the business aspect because I live in America so I'll never own a NIO the wait time doesn't effect me. 

It only services 1 manufacturer and 1 battery type. Adding different variations of batteries doesn't scale up. No one else is will ever pick up their standard and put themselves at the mercy of NIOs infrastructure. It cost more to manufacturer. It's more a liability than an asset.

Every extra battery is one less car they make. Batteries are still the bottle neck as far as I'm aware."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"What bond yields tell us about the state of the economy. \[**Disclaimer:** I'm new to this but do have a small background in economics.  I posted this as a comment to another user in the daily thread, but since I put some effort into it and think it's a valuable write-up, I decided to make a thread.  If anything is off, please go ahead and correct me.  I do believe that the bulk of what I'm saying is accurate.\]

&#x200B;

My understanding is that rates (bond yields) go up when the economy is in good shape. That's because people are more confident in equities and they sell off bonds (less demand = lower prices = higher yields).

When the economy is in bad shape, people go back to bonds because they're a safer alternative to stocks. People don't trust in the stock market's ability to perform and flock to bonds to give them fixed income and a safer place to park their capital. More demand for bonds = higher bond prices = lower yields.

Short answer for why bond yields and prices are inversely correlated: say you have a bond that's worth $1000 face value and has a 2% yield.  If demand for bonds has gone down and you must now sell that bond on the secondary market for, say, $800, then the yield has increased.  Why?  Because the buyer is paying less money for the same fixed return.  Less money for the same fixed return = higher overall yield.  And vice versa.  I encourage everyone to look this up if you're not clear on it.

Apart from that, right now is a weird time. Bond rates went up recently, and people were saying that was a *bad* sign for the markets. That's because people were saying it was related to inflation. Imagine: if inflation is going up, bonds with their current 1-2% yields (and negative real yields) are a horrible place to park your cash. You're actually losing money already due to negative real yields, but if inflation spikes 1-3% you're actually losing even more. Remember, bond yields are fixed so inflation eats into their nominal (fixed) yields.

The theory was that economic stimulus plus dovish Fed policy (low interest rates, easy money) made people fearful that inflation was just around the corner. Thus, they began to sell off their bonds. Remember, less demand for bonds = lower prices = higher yields. If this were indeed the motivation for the bond sell-off, it's actually a *negative* indicator for the economy. It means we expect inflation to come. It means the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates to contain inflation (more expensive to borrow money). It means that future earnings will be worth less (value of dollars in the future goes down). This is why tech stocks sank at the same time bond yields went up: A. because they depend on easy capital (low interest rates) to expand their operations, and B. their valuation at the moment is highly linked to their future earnings.

However, Jay Powell and the Fed came out and said any inflation would just be transitory, and the market seemed to believe it. The bond sell-off was contained. Furthermore, analysts were saying, like I said in the first half of my post, that rising bond yields is actually positive for the economy.

So basically the fears about inflation got buried and we're back to a ""normal"" scenario where rising bond yields are seen as a positive sign for the markets.

I'm not sure why bond yields went down today, but a quick Google search said that higher yields have attracted some investors (including overseas investors) back in.

I'm new to this but it was good for me to make sure I understand it and try to explain it. Anyone who reads this can feel free to correct anything that is wrong."
2021-04-16 07:21:38,stocks,"I think that bond yields went down yesterday due to large purchases. The simple relationship between yields and economic recovery doesn't make sense because job and retail data released yesterday was fantastic. Perhaps buyers allocated profits from other investments into bonds, yesterday. The fed is still buying back treasuries and suppressing yields. I am of the opinion that we will not get any meaningful inflation without a significant policy change that increases the income if the bottom 50% of people in the USA whether that is with UBI, increase in minimum wage, or a comprehensive economic overhaul. I don't see that happening, given how divided the USA congress is. Several democrats shot down $15 minimum wage and too few support UBI to pass, despite that it was started under the Republican administration. If the 10yr hits 1.85 and none of the above occur to increase wages, then I'm going to start buying T bonds. Price will go up as yields go back down.  This happened in 2019...job growth was incredible, record unemployment but too many jobs in service industry, and the 10yr was going down."

Yes, that was the point.  Higher rates are actually indicative of a bull market.

2% inflation is good, maybe even 4% maximum, you're correct.  Anything more than that is not good.  

> Numbers show the fed is correct.

For now.  But there's the risk that the inflation will not be transitory as they say.  I don't know enough about all this to really say, but the numbers we have at the moment are good.

* Horrible fundamentals, PE ratio in ~150 and PS ratio in ~25
* Minimal moat.  They invented a slightly better converter ... That's it.
* There's alot of competition, most of which are more fairly priced.

In my mind, if you don't have strong rebuttals to the above you should sell it all now.

I wouldn't sell 100% of your shares, but I think I would pull out enough to ensure ENPH isn't more than 10%, and then take the money and put it into VOO/VTI. You already won, and think about how bad you'll feel if ENPH crashes to the low $100's because of bad Q1 earnings.

But, this also depends on your time horizons. If you plant to hold ENPH for 10 years, just ignore this. But if you aren't convicted in ENPH to handle a 50% drawdown, then you should definitely reduce your position."
2021-04-16 12:54:41,stocks,"PE and PS ratio definitely scare me. And I'm not misaligned to the concerns you've brought up.

I would not agree that their moat is minimal. I would say that their microinverters are the defacto standard in the industry. And they've been coupling it with smart software to redirect power into battery charging, grid and home use.

Unfortunately, the home I live in doesn't have great sun to benefit from solar, so I don't have personal experience with Enphase.


Honestly, my biggest worry is that they've run up so fast and aggressively in a short period of time, that they're due for even more pullback.

Their revenue growth is amazing from their 10k:
https://investor.enphase.com/node/18836/html#ib51ac078944f40aabcb529ec51955ccf_487

And their margins are becoming impressive. Their margins have improved from 30% in 2018 to 45% in 2020.  

But does this all justify their PE and PS ratio?

I tend to ignore PE ratios in growing companies because there are so many ways to fuck with the accounting numbers. The PS ratio is okay but also, doesn't take into account margins and profitability.

When I have doubts like this, I like to look at cash flow. The biggest thing that stands out to me in their 2019 to 2020 balance sheet is the increase of their cash position. They've grown their cash position from $251M to $650M. They also have a very low goodwill on their balance sheet which gives me confidence that they aren't propping up their assets with fluff. Unfortunately, in conjunction with their cash position, they also have a huge increase in their debt position from $2M to $325M. 

So maybe this offsets the cash positivity?

Analysts have price targets over 200 on median for ENPH:  https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=enph

Generally, this doesn't mean anything to me, but it gives me a weird sense of confidence that ENPH can still run.


The biggest worry I have for ENPH right now is that SPWR and MAXN got absolutely clobbered after their earnings. Both had lower than expectations for revenues and earnings. And since SPWR and MAXN were partnered with ENPH to deliver solar panels:

https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2020/07/with-maxeon-spin-off-sunpower-takes-enphase-ac-module-to-global-market/

Those two make up like half my portfolio on there. But again that money i dont wanna lose but im not to worried about it really.

2021-04-16 14:00:58,stocks,"Your portfolio is in SOFI is $4882 with ENPH worth $1955, about 40%. Here's my advice, and a lot of it depends on your income levels and expectations of growth.

Your SOFI account seems like a bit of a ""yolo"" and ""play"" account. In which case, my advice is that you don't spread across multiple stocks. $5000 over your lifetime will be inconsequential if you have steady income, a 401k and a roth IRA.

Before you sell ENPH, you need a plan on where that money will go. Do you believe the market will crash so you'll just keep it in cash? Will you just convert it to VOO until you figure out what to do with it? Do you have any undervalued stocks that would better run than ENPH? What is your time horizon?

If I was you,  ere's what I'd do in your SOFI account. I would find out from ENPH, AMD, ICLN, PLTR and SNAP which one I like the most. Which one has the best valuation and growth potential. I would develop conviction for my decision and consolidate all the money into one of those stocks. Also, be aware that ICLN has about 5% exposure to ENPH.

This is a more high risk/high reward strategy, but honesty, I think it has the best ROI for your goals and objectives.

As for ENPH? I don't know how it stacks up against PLTR and SNAP. I'm not in either. I have been eyeing PLTR for a while, but I don't have enough conviction in it to hold it for 2 years. I think in 2 years it could see 100. But again, I'm not convicted enough to hold through all the choppiness. ENPH has many more analysts giving price targets up in the mid-200's. Analysts aren't always right, but they seem to believe that ENPH still has much more to go despite its already inflated P/E and P/S numbers.

RUN just got a big upgrade from an analyst saying that residential solar will be hot in 2021 and 2022. Couple that with the fact that ENPH has been gaining market share against competitors, specifically SEDG. If ENPH can maintain market share growth, and residential solar keeps growing, then I think their price targets of $200 are totally justified. But if they start hitting tailwinds seen by SPWR and MAXN, then I think they're in real trouble."

It's hard to find a multi-bagger stock in the days of high valuations. Especially when inflation has traditionally been linked to lower P/E in the stock market’s history. Three important features for a multi-bagger is a stock that has good growth potential, a low P/E, and good leadership. I believe that LL has all of those qualities. A few years back the company was entangled in two lawsuits. One involving formaldehyde at higher than acceptable levels and another for not sourcing their lumber in accordance with law. As a consequence, the cash flows were heavily decreased, and investor sentiment was massively damaged. Consequently, the current P/E is sitting at about 12. I will address in greater detail each of these three drivers now.

**Leadership:**

Right after the legal entanglements, the CEO of the company was fired and the company hired CEO Charles Tyson. Charles Tyson has worked with a lot of supply chains including Advance Autoparts, OfficMax, and Officedepot. Since taking the position, he has focused on rebranding the company and increasing online sales and is trying to increase their market sales to pros.

**P/E:**

Interestingly, although cash flows took a hit in 2019 and 2018 due to legal battles and therefore the earnings decreased, the revenue stayed consistent. In 2019, their free cash flow was -20M and in 2020 it was 141M! I view their legal troubles as a chapter that has passed in the company’s history, but still has damaged their P/E as compared to their historical valuations. For example, FND, the closest market competitor, has a P/E of 57!

**Growth:**

As everyone is aware, 2021 is going to be a blow out year for housing. Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that interest rates will be kept low throughout the year, the Biden administration is looking for more infrastructure spending, and housing costs are all strong tailwinds for new housing starts. Moreover, one of the most common things people want done in a newly purchased home is the flooring redone. Lastly, hard flooring is expected to grow as carpeting shrinks as total market share. This company’s gross profit has grown for several years in a row, and it would be almost inconceivable that it won’t grow in 2021 and onward.

Additionally, LL has increased their digital presence with the release of a new app that allows people to virtually install flooring in their home by taking a picture of their current floors. I would recommend anyone to try the app out for free. It works incredibly well! I see these as great headwinds for growth of the company.

I can’t help but feel incredibly confident in earnings of the company this year, even in the short term. Year over year earnings will be incredible. Q1 of 2020 was a terrible quarter. Historically they have always outperformed in Q1 vs the prior year’s Q4, but Q1 2020 was the shutdown quarter. As all indicators point to an incredible quarter, Q1 2021 will displace last year’s Q1 and dramatically shift the P/E even lower. Naturally, I see this as an even more enticing scenario as more people will want to buy the stock.

For full disclosure, I love the stock, I own the stock, I will continue to invest in the stock, and I am not a financial advisor and you shouldn’t think I am providing financial advice. I'm looking forward to anyone's comments on the company."
2021-04-15 20:42:22,stocks,"Just to clarify... You're calling them LL flooring but the ticker LL is lumber liquidators, is that the right company?"
2021-04-16 00:13:41,stocks,I like it.   Thanks for the write up.
2021-04-15 21:06:21,stocks,If only the ticker was WW instead of LL
2021-04-16 12:22:56,stocks,Isn't this the same lumber liquidators that was selling flooring with a known chemical that got people sick?

2021-04-16 12:34:34,stocks,"I don't have any evidence that it got people sick. But, there formaldehyde levels were too high in one if their chinese-manufsctured flooring products. They denied it. They were sued. They lost. The paid a ton if money. They fired their CEO. And here we are."

2021-04-16 13:30:26,stocks,"Yep, it happens. Just like roundup. It has never been proven to cause non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and in fact that cancer has been in decline since glyosophate has been in use. Yet, major lawsuits have been won to the order of more than $10B.  I'm not here to argue what chemical science says, but just that I'm not sold that lives lost or permanent/transient health was proven to be damaged. Maybe this single family has a case.

As they stated, they never even had levels of formaldehyde tested, and I don't take a legal battle as proof. 
I would like to be clear though that I don't condone their actions. It was reckless and stupid. However, I look at the scandal as a benefit to my investment strategy.  The scandal sets up a PE multiplier for the following reasons:

1. PE is suppressed based on prior lawsuit.

2. Fines and escrow accounts regarding the lawsuit has been paid out, so will not affect the bottom line moving forward.

3. Revenues remained constant even when publicity was at its worst through the scandal. Therefore, public sentiment doe not appear to causing them to no longer sell products. This negativity will fade with time and their rebranding efforts.

4. The old CEO has been fired and a new CEO installed. They stopped selling the brand associated with the formaldehyde and they are also divesting out of China. They are also under probation with audits of their actions. These actions will help ensure the company keeps out of trouble moving forward.

5. As they remain in good standing moving forward, investors will be more likely to invest.  The sector is trading at an enormously high PE. FND trades at about 50 PE.  

6. PE Valuation multiplication coupled with future growth will make this one a multi bagger."

2021-04-15 20:32:22,stocks,they are borrowing in 2021 dollars and will repay one tranche in 2052 dollars.  I will guess the real rate of interest will be negative given the fed can’t stop going brrrrrr.

2021-04-16 07:36:20,stocks,"how is it an inflation hedge? If money is losing value and it pays the same interest, that means that they are 'paying' more in real terms for each interest payment. Plus the 13 billion will be worth less in real terms if they thought inflation was going to be high in the coming years. I think it's more of an interest rate hedge, where they lock in low interest rates as they expect rates to go up in the future. In an inflationary environment it's better to lend, not borrow."
2021-04-15 23:17:56,stocks,Various other institutions
2021-04-16 08:00:28,stocks,"In an inflationary environment it’s much better to borrow and not lend.  Think about it this way, JPM takes out $13B in debt that they pay 2.7% interest on.  They then turn around and buy positions in raw materials like lumber, steel, and oil.  Since that $13B of value was transferred into real goods, if inflation goes up 10% then the value of those commodities will increase accordingly(and likely at a multiple of inflation).  JPM gets to keep the difference for free.  Inflation means that money is a lot easier to come by, meaning debts are a lot easier to pay off."
2021-04-16 08:08:53,stocks,"that's not what inflation means and I can bet you that the $13 billion will not be used to buy lumber, steel and oil. Inflation means that the buying power of money decreases as inflation eats it away. I repeat, and this is based on economics 101, in an inflationary environment, it is better to lend than borrow. Speculating on what you would do with that kind of money is different to what JPM will use it for."
2021-04-15 21:55:35,stocks,There’s always a market crash coming. Always. In 2008 the 2020 crash was just 12 years away.
2021-04-16 00:08:40,stocks,and when the rates rise then they’ll be lending that money at higher rates.borrow fat amounts of cash now lending at x rate and in a couple years they’ll be lending that back out at 2x
2021-04-16 08:26:29,stocks,"Anybody with large fixed-rate debt (like $13B in bonds issued) benefits from an inflationary environment.  In real terms, it costs less to pay off the debt.  I’m not sure what you’re not understanding or where you took Econ 101."
2021-04-16 18:08:26,stocks,"In 2007 the market crashed but the absolute lowest point was in 2009.

2020 had a nice crack but the bulk didn't bulge. It was comparable to other shifts in 2018 and such. 

If a crash is coming, it'll split the S&P open like a nutcracker as they've done before. Statistically one shows up every 8 years iirc. A correction happens every 2-3 years.

Judging by the clown market and the yield curve inversion, this may-june is the expected crash. A lot of people have big cash ready to blow at that moment.

We'll see how it goes."
2021-04-16 09:19:07,stocks,"You are right, I mixed them up. When you borrow money and you pay interest, the lender has lower spending power with that constant stream of cash. The borrower bring forward cash which it can use today at today's prices."

On top of that, draftkings went literally all out on advertising. When I commuted to work I'd see DK advertisements on the walls of train station, above the seats on the train, on the stairs as you walk up, billboards on the way to the train station. For every dozen physical DK advertisements, I'd see 1 fanduel. It's not really a question around here who new sports bettors are going to use.

Having good growth doesn't mean you have to be losing money.

But there is very little brand loyalty in this market. Their market share disappears as soon as their marketing budget decreases, so the margins will always be thin. It’s not the same kind of growth strategy that you can see in other industries that grows aggressively and then adapt to a leaner optimization for profits. 

This is their end game, the growth from here is entirely based on legalization and semi capped from there."

2021-04-15 21:13:52,stocks,It really depends on situation. Options are a great tool to use in your portfolio and it can be used a hundred different ways. Each situation would need go be weighted differently.
2021-04-15 21:46:36,stocks,"What they didn’t mention is that when you buy options to ‘hold your place’ as they said, you pay a premium (fee) to the person who wrote (sold) the option. You don’t get the premium refunded to you or anything so if you decide to exercise your options you are still buying the shares at the strike price you bought, if it is ‘in the money’ (If the share price is higher than the strike price for a call contract). 

There are no July calls for sale right now, but June and august calls at a strike of $23 are around $2.50 and $3.45 respectively per share. A contract is 100 shares, so the premium you pay to buy the June option is $250 and $345 for august.

Problem is if the share price does not exceed the strike price at contract expiration date. That means you paid the premium but can’t take advantage of the option to buy the shares at the lower strike price. So then you would just be buying the shares at market price anyways. This is the risk you take when buying options."
2021-04-15 23:53:49,stocks,"Another thing about options is that most people especially retail investors will trade options for the premiums alone, rather than exercise to ""hold their place."" Due to a number of factors (the greeks), option premium price movement can be exponential to the movement of the underlying stock, so you can gain or lose a lot of money very quickly depending on how loaded up you are on options. Brokerages will usually start by approving you to trade options on just the long side. You have no obligation to exercise them or even afford to exercise them. Let's say you load up on calls or puts, hoping that the underlying stock moves in the right direction within a certain time frame. If you get it right, you sell the inflated options for an exponential gain in premium as they approach expiration. But if you get it wrong, those options can quickly go to $0. Easy way to blow up your account if you get greedy.

Trading options is fun and very cerebral once you get into selling options and spreads and whatnot. Just start small and expect to lose at first. And learn the greeks."

I know I can save $7K between now and then so I plan to either sell my contracts for a boat load of money by June if PLTR moons or simply buying my shares of PLTR at market. Which ever is the better play.

The argument is that because they offer a ""no purchase necessary"" method to play, they fall under legal ""sweepstakes"" laws, and are not actually gambling devices.

The prize pool of the NBA contests change daily based on the day of the week and what other events are happening that day.  They seem to be adjusting tournament s based on their data, so that's good for shareholders (not so good for players). 

you are right, they are burning cash like crazy, but there is so much room for growth and their cash burn is most likely going to give them the biggest market share in the industry once everything shakes out.  I bought the majority of my shares around $19, so I'm happy with a 200% return in the last year, but I think it will keep running for a while longer."
2021-04-15 21:32:11,stocks,"Okay, cool thanks for the insight. But, in this situation you really are just okay with letting your premium ""buy-in"" go as a business cost (in the form of buying the ""line-holder"", yes?"
2021-04-15 23:07:56,stocks,"So say you get the $2.50 contract. You've paid $250 for the right to buy 100 PLTR shares at $23 so your total price is $2300+$250 = $2550 = $25.50 per share essentially. So you wouldn't be 'in the money' unless the stock price goes above $25.50 right? And you can make money from options by trading those contracts even if you have no intention to buy the shares, you can just sell in the money calls for a solid premium if the price goes higher (thus making the contract more valuable.)

So am I right in assuming that I could sell calls of my stock if I was bearish on it? Say if I thought PLTR was going down, I could sell calls against them for like $30 and earn a nice premium. And if it stays below $30 by the expiry of the option then no-one will buy the option so I'll just earn a premium for doing nothing? And I could do a play like that every month depending on how I feel about the stock? Have I understood all this correctly? Sorry for the nooby questions but I don't know much about options at all."

My point was that OP could keep his investment in the underlying he wants until he can buy back his shares."
2021-04-16 07:52:02,stocks,">So you wouldn't be 'in the money' unless the stock price goes above $25.50 right?

Just a quick correction. Whether a contract is in the money or out of the money depends on the stock price and the strike price. It does not take into account how much anyone paid or received to enter into a position.

So a $25 call contract is in the money as soon as the stock price goes above $25. Holding an ITM contract does not automatically means you're profitable as you've identified the break-even of $25.50.

And what you described is a ""covered call"" - a great way to earn income when the stock is bearish or trading sideways. The downside is that you're capping your profits."
2021-04-16 00:01:40,stocks,"Yes. The other side is that if you're bullish, you can sell puts of a stock, and as long as it stays above your strike you buy the put back at a later date for less without ever owning the stock. Just make sure you have cash on hand to cover - if it tanks past your strike you're on the hook for 100 shares at your strike price.

Check out r/thetagang."
2021-04-15 21:58:14,stocks,"You’re welcome. Nothing wrong with just buying shares. 

Just as a side note, You also need to get approved by your broker before you are able to trade options and there are different approval levels at which options you can trade. 

Honestly options can be really useful as hedging tools or for income generation or speculation profits, but you need to know how they work. It can get really expensive and if things don’t go your way a fast way to lose money.

You can sell contracts you bought to close instead of exercising, but you will still sell at a loss if the stock price hasn’t moved in a favorable direction since you bought the option."

I jumped in when it went below $25. It's only 3% of my portfolio but I think the risk is worth the potential upside. I think there's going to be heavy tailwinds as data and security only grow in importance. I'm putting this in the sock drawer for at least half a decade.

If you buy a call to ""hold your place"", it doesn't change that your brokerage will report the initial sale of stock, it only holds your place in that you won't miss any price action from where you sold. 2) The implied volatility of the stock will influence the price of the options contract, if IV is high, you'll end up paying a high premium for a call.

We already have a cohort builder for clinical research. We already have a data governance platform. We already have a data science platform. They would have to convince us to ditch all of those at once.

* They say it's modular, but none of it looks all that compelling unless you go all-in to the ecosystem. This is good because their sales will be sticky, but it raises their barrier of entry.

* Love the integration with R and Python. Not being able to write code in my own environment is a dealbreaker.

* I literally laughed out loud when they said they could take data standardization projects from years to weeks. That's nonsense, but maybe an executive would fall for it.

* This seems like a shitshow to implement. Their forward engineer deployment is a great idea to deal with this, but that requirement isn't going away and it's hard to scale that. It turns them into more of a consulting company than a software company, or I guess a hybrid?

* They didn't mention Epic once, which stood out to me. Epic runs our entire organization, along with almost every other large health system in the US. It also famously does not play nice with others, which is probably why they avoided mentioning it. Glossing over something like ""you can deploy this model in your EHR"" is a red flag. We've been through years of pain trying to get that to work.

Thanks again, I'll be forwarding this to my bosses to see what they think."

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 15, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 15, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Thursday, with all three major indexes reaching fresh intraday records as market participants digested a much better-than-expected unemployment report and a sharp increase in consumer spending. The S&P 500 is up roughly 5% in the month of April, led primarily by mega-cap technology and financial stocks. 

Today, the economic data released was very promising. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. 

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.” Despite the setback with JNJ, distribution of the vaccine remains strong in the US, with the CDC reporting more than 3 million doses being distributed per day.

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"DKNG Novice DD and Questions **Disclosure:** I've been holding DKNG for awhile now, only 100 shares.

&#x200B;

I'm curious about the valuation of DKNG. In my opinion it is poised to be much more valuable than it is currently worth. It has partnerships with UFC, WWE, a bunch of NBA teams, ESPN, Caesars Entertainment group and more.\[2\]

They are becoming basically Athlead (Office Reference) with hiring Cal Ripkin Jr and Michael Jordan as advisors among other athletes. They are the forefront of sports gambling in the United States yet they are falling while other stocks are rising.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]

At one point they were poised to merge with Fanduel but were blocked by the FCC because it would have created a 90% monopoly in online sports betting.\[4\]

It's 50 day average is rising and it hit a high about a week ago \[5\] but I still believe the price point is higher than $70 even.

With sports coming back, working people with disposable who are more technology savvy because of this pandemic and the partnerships with almost everyone, I think DraftKing has the potential to be in every sports betters hand.

If there's anything in the way, it's competition obviously but also laws that need to change to get them into more states. So, I think I'm long on DKNG as I can't imagine them going on a downward trend for any reason. Gambling and sports have been best friends forever and they are one of the leaders of introducing it to the internet.

&#x200B;

What are you thoughts everyone?

P.S. - I am a noob at stocks and investing research. I am giving my best effort as some sort of DD to learn more myself and I know I likely looked over a lot of key points. Thanks for reading.

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Short Thesis - Capital Senior Living Corporation ($CSU)  Here is why I am initiating a short position in Capital Senior Living Corporation (Ticker Symbol: CSU) and why you should probably take a look into it too:

Business:

Capital Senior Corporation, or CSU, provides senior living services to elderly population over the age of 75+. As of December of 2019, which is the date of their last annual report, they own 126 housing operations in 23 states with approximately 16,000 residents in total. The services they provide include senior living services, assisted living services, meals, healthcare, and other personal care services for the elderly.

The company makes money by charging a monthly ""rent"" to the elderly who live in their residences. In their annual report, they mention that their residents are either in a financial position to pay for the service themselves or have family, such as children, who can provide them with the financial support to pay for this. In addition to owning multiple properties throughout the U.S, CSU also leases properties.

Qualitative Analysis:

The qualitative reasons for the short position are quite obvious. 8 out of 10 COVID deaths reported are for people over the age of 65. This means that the target customer base for CSU has been hit the hardest. Unlike many other businesses, such as retail or hospitality, where you can argue that customers will come back once COVID subsides, you cannot make that same argument for this company. The death rate of this demographic suggests that many of CSU's customers are not going to be coming back, even post-COVID.

The other consideration with COVID here is that people are much more likely to distrust retirement homes or senior living services moving forward. There was a massive scandal in New York City where Governor Cuomo pushed elderly people into retirement homes, only to end up killing a large portion of that population. I'm not gonna go into the political details of it, but you can read about it here: [https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/)

All of this suggests that elderly people are not incentivized to go into retirement homes anytime soon. Even with the large vaccination numbers under the Biden administration, it is unlikely that the entire effects of the pandemic are going to subside anytime soon. If you are elderly and especially at risk, you are much more likely to call in for home care or some other alternatives, rather than finding yourself in a living service with other people where the chances of the virus spreading are high.

Now there are two ways you can argue against this short position on a qualitative basis. First, if you do some research, you'll find out that CSU recently vaccinated most of its residents. However, this doesn't solve the problem that they lost most of their customers in the past year, who are never coming back. Even with the vaccination, elderly people are not going to feel confident about living in these facilities for a long time. Second, you can argue that healthcare services in the United States are getting better. This means that life expectancies are going to be higher in the future, meaning more elderly people living = better business for CSU. However, given the effects of this pandemic, we are not going to see CSU occupancy and revenue numbers return back to pre-COVID levels for a very long time. Life expectancies are probably going to remain suppressed due to COVID for a long time, and I am taking this short position with a 1-1.5 year time horizon. By the time the life expectancy rolls back, I will have exited the short with a pretty hefty return.

Financial Analysis:

Now the quantitative and financial analysis of this company makes it even more clear why a short position is obvious. In 2018, the company's revenue dropped by 1.1%. In 2019, revenues dropped by 2.8%. In 2020, revenues dropped by almost 20%

Now let's look at net income. Since 2015, the company has not turned a single year of profit. In fact, their net income has decreased every single year. From -$14.3 million in 2015 to -$295.4 million in 2020. Even without the COVID-19 impact, this company was on a downward slope towards bankruptcy. With COVID, it seems unlikely that this company can ever do a turnaround.

Looking at the balance sheet only confirms this thesis. As of now, the company has cash of only 17.9 million while the short-term and long-term debt of over 900 million. Even if the company liquidated all of its properties that it owns, which has a book value of roughly 928 million, the company can barely remain solvent. Add on top of this the fact that the company has been selling portions of its property to REITs in order to keep operating, you quickly realize that CSU can never reach pre-COVID 19 levels of revenue ever again.

Add on top of this that the company's stock is up from $13 to $40 a share over the past year, you realize that something doesn't add up here. The intrinsic value of the company is far far lower than where it is trading today, giving additional conviction to my short thesis. In my opinion, CSU is one of the zombie companies that's being kept alive due to PPP and reckless spending, but soon enough, people will realize that their business model no longer works, even in a post-COVID world.

Virgin Galactic shares erase 2021 gains after Richard Branson's stake sale https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/15/virgin-galactic-stock-erases-2021-gains-after-bransons-stake-sale.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard

Chamath last month sold his entire personal holdings in the company.  

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chamath-palihapitiya-sells-virgin-galactic-spce-stake.html

Recently the stock seemed to be way overpriced due to the whole WSB and GME craze as Virgin Galactic was the second most shorted company.  Now it seems the stock is coming back to earth.  

They also have had lots of trouble with their space program due to engineering issues, specifically EMI or electromagnetic interference.  This resulted in the new CEO letting go many people and delaying commercial operations until next year at earliest. 

So what are your thoughts on Virgin Galactic?  Positions: current shareholder"
2021-04-15 22:42:11,stocks,"One of the strongest indicators that something is ""up"" is when insiders start selling.

By narrowly focusing on space tourism and suborbital flight you insure that any problems with safety destroy your company. Most of the money and space has to do with satellites and satellites also provide you a way to launch a rocket dozens of times before people get on it. If you can launch satellites into orbit essentially you can watch people into orbit. The three rocket companies that show some innovation are SpaceX, rocket lab, and blue origin. Rocket lab is the only one you can buy stock in and it's the smaller and generally lags behind SpaceX, but definitely a good company."

Seeing that both him and Branson sold huge sums of the stock is just as bad as news can get for a stock. This thing is dependent on Branson, chamath and the success of the launches. There are no fundamentals, no cash flow/profit/revenue nothing just hype and speculation which is fine I speculate on stocks all the time. But a speculative stock is dependent on its leadership actively promoting it and what these two did in the past few days was literally the opposite."

2021-04-16 11:44:19,stocks,You must hang out in the SPCE subreddit!
2021-04-15 20:29:56,stocks,Preparing? They went from $60 to $20. That being said they just formed the right shoulder of the biggest H&S ive ever seen lol
2021-04-16 07:59:29,stocks,"Thanks for the comments, however it seems a lot has changed since February, here are 10:

1. EMI issue bigger then we initially thought 

2. Commercial operations delayed until 2022

3. Hint of shareholder dilution at earnings call 

4. Spaceship 3 reveal

5. George Whitesides out and several other key employees 

6. New leadership in engineering hired 

7. Chamath sells entire personal holdings of the company 

8. Richard Branson sells $150 million dollars of shares 

9. Blue origin (a direct competitor) had a successful test flight 

10. Ark launches space ETF and Virgin Galactic is less than 2% of fund"
2021-04-16 08:23:28,stocks,"So based on my research of going to the earnings call, reading the 10ks, they should be able to do 1 billion in revenue 5 years in the future at say a 50% margin. But to get their will likely cost 500 million to a billion in stock dilutions.   

I think the core business of simply flying rich people to space from one spaceport is not scaleable which is a huge problem.  However could there be other things they do to make it work?  Yes.  But I don’t know if they are even attempting that.  

I am half and half if even using their spaceship concept is even good versus blue origin.  There are pros and cons to both.  But the way VirginGalactic did it requires a test pilot each time which means the testing phase is a long drawn out process for safety.  Blue origin for example or space x can blow up a rocket and there is no loss of life in the testing phase.  Might be a design flaw on VirginGalactic part.  However people do feel more comfortable with a pilot on board. 

End of the day I think the company is overvalued given the risks.  I think they might succeed but at the cost of several stock dilutions and they are a long way out"
2021-04-16 08:32:27,stocks,"Is it even a viable business model to justify the valuation?  I mean you have RocketLab at a $4 billion valuation with actual revenue and is the second most launched rocket provider next to Space X in the US.  But virgin galactic has a higher valuation?   

I think given the risks it should come down.  I mean all it takes is one accident for your investment to be gone and given those risks you should get a discount on the share.  Add to that all the bad news and lack of execution they have"
2021-04-16 18:59:39,stocks,"Cool, what do you like about Virgin Galactic?"
2021-04-16 19:03:33,stocks,"Maybe, maybe not.   According to Virgin Galactic, they or no one company will be able to meet demand of their product"

Any space stock is in this category of its current values are considered super cheap in comparison to the future reality.  Investing into space I beleive is a wonderfull long term concept nomatter who it is.  And if they can not use rockets and delivery people to space, that is a one up from the competition also."

2021-04-15 21:49:50,stocks,"Their architecture is basically mothership plus winged rocket. This architecture has certain advantages, ie being able to launch at any inclination, more weather resistant, no sonic booms near takeoff point, but scalability isn’t one of them. In order to launch a decent sized rocket either to make orbit or take a hundred people, you need a ginormous mothership. And I believe the math works with exponents.

Their hybrid rocket engine is unique, but is not very efficient. They may need to do research and get experience with cryogenics — which pretty much all non military rockets use.

And lastly, you are going by what management is projecting into the future. When were they ever correct?

2021-04-16 15:09:49,stocks,Yeah RocketLab seems like a solid business and a true competitor to space X that is carving out it’s own niche.  It still under the radar to the public which i think is a good sign if you want to load up on shares while it’s low.
2021-04-15 22:49:06,stocks,"I bought them ~3 days after the merger was announced, probably should have waited for a better discount lol.

To understand why Rocket Labs is a good buy, you need to understand where the space industry is headed and how they differ from SpaceX. The short of it is that small satellite constellations are going to take over the old earth centric space market and lower the cost of entry. This will expand the market for who buys the data and feed into more launches. For example, you can find gas leaks in pipe lines, get roofing dimensions without sending someone on top of your house, find greenhouse emission hot spots, monitor global supply chains, gather data on traffic patterns and shopping behavior, etc all  on demand with small satellite constellations. 

Rocket Lab stands out here because that is who they cater to. Their main payload isn’t a large satellite, it is a small satellite. While it is more expensive than rideshare, getting the right orbit and the right schedule is important for many constellations that want to cover the whole earth with a high pass rate. They are currently the only service doing this and getting to space. They also are setting themselves out to be a one stop shop for satellites by providing high margin items like reaction wheels and star trackers that they can easily validate in any excess space on their own rockets. I wouldn’t be surprised if they start selling kits customers can use to fly their payloads with.

Their next rocket is aiming to accommodate more satellites at a time, just like what SpaceX is doing with Starlink. However, Rocket Lab has been leveraging the connections they built to gauge what the market needs. They aren’t shooting for Mars as their end goal, which allows them to cut inefficient excess that SpaceX has to build for. This brings the cost down and makes them more competitive. 

It’s a challenging space to do business in, but their track record is pretty insane. I’m very bullish on these guys."

I've tried to diversify out of ""reddit stocks"" and so I've gone to some of the yahoo message boards and stocktwits sometimes just to see what people are saying about other stocks I'm interested in.

However, on these boards, I often see some very antagonistic negative comments. I like negative takes- as we've all seen, cult-like positivity can be disastrous. But some of these folks just seem to show up and be gross trolls. I just can't figure out why. If you don't like a stock, why go on its board? Why tweet weird bear gifs? etc

I'm not very conspiracy minded and have always been pretty skeptical about ""hedge fund manipulation"" (I'm sure it happens sometimes, I def think what happened with RH was sketch, but they're just business dudes trying to make money not supervillains). But sometimes I read some of these things and I can't figure out why people take time and energy to trash seemingly random stocks. So I do kinda wonder, do shorts go out and try to drum up bear noises? Are these just your standard dogs on the internet? Is there any legitimacy to the idea of manipulation? What do you think?"

As someone who has spent several years following this and a few other subreddits, it just feels totally different now.

When you see BB announcing their big partnership with AWS, I don't think it means AWS will be pushing or promoting BB's product in any way. It's simply that BB picked AWS as their cloud provider and negotiated some preferred rates in exchange of some good PR.

The product is Blackberry Ivy. Not AWS Ivy.
It happens to be built on top of AWS, which just means it's going to be expensive AF to run. AWS wins and blackberry pays rent.

2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Why I'm bullish on APD, long DD  I've been looking into Hydrogen for quite a while, especially more recently with the hit its taken, but the more I've looked into it, the more I think APD is severely undervalued at its current price. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm extremely bullish on it. I wrote a DD on it not too long ago, but I wanted to add more, since I’ve learnt more. I’m going to apologise in advance, considering how messy this is. I’ve been adding notes to it as I go along. Obligatory: I'm not your financial advisor. I suggest, and encourage you to do your own DD on APD. I love the stock, but that doesn't mean you necessarily should

I think hydrogen has a better future than EV, in that hydrogen production will be far more lucrative. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015 and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future; the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. With this in mind, let's continue.

First, I want to talk purely speculative, this has no impact on the DD below, but I think it gives some good insight into the possibility’s hydrogen has to offer. People think we need to move to EV cars to lower carbon dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but they forget other forms of transportation. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, to reduce their emissions and become carbon free would require a move to either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. This is not an issue that will affect planes, it will also affect ships, and other forms of travel that require significant amounts of energy. Research has already begun into this, with Airbus having announced plans for 3 different hydrogen-fuelled concepts, with the aim of developing zero-emission aircraft that could enter commercial service by 2035. As for ships, it was estimated that by 2020 emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from ships will exceed land-based emissions in Europe. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

What are the current demands for hydrogen? Well, some key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment. 

$APD not only produces hydrogen, but also have room to grow in their production of Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide. They have great earnings and a P/E ratio of 33. The projected market for Oxygen is $30 Billion by 2025, for Nitrogen its about $33 Billion. Argon has a much smaller, but not insignificant projected market of $487 million by 2026, and $12.1 billion for carbon dioxide by 2027. As if that weren't enough, they also produce semiconductor materials (with a semiconductor shortage, there is a lot to gain here); natural gas liquefaction technology and equipment (I don't know much about that stuff); epoxy additives (Epoxy resins are used in Wind Turbines, Electrical systems like circuit boards. Epoxy resin market is expected to almost double in value to over $10 Billion); Gas Cabinets (I'm not too informed on these, but here's what wikipedia has to say for those interested: A gas cabinet is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.). 50% of $1.6 billion in backlog of equipment orders is expected to be recognised in revenue during 2021.

An important question is why I think they’re favourable, over the likes of Linde? Well, with APD being the largest supplier of Hydrogen, any green initiatives are extremely favourable towards them. Looking at financials, the net income of Linde isn’t far beyond that of APD, despite pulling in revenues of $27 billion. Considering that Linde has 2 principle business areas to manage, I feel like this lack of income may stunt their future growth, at least in the near-term.  

I was able to find some information on production numbers, so I said I’d add them here, so you can get an idea as to where they specialise. Overall, regional industrial gases sales constituted 94% of consolidated sales. Sales of atmospheric gases constituted approximately 47% of consolidated sales, while sales of Hydrogen, Syngas, and related products constituted approximately 22% of sales. Sales of equipment constituted 6% of consolidated sales. 

TLDR: I think this is severely undervalued. They are profitable now, but they have far more room to grow, and will definitely grow, thanks to the demand for atmospheric gases alone from the pharmaceutical sector, and the growing manufacturing industry in the developing economies of Asia Pacific. As clean energy is pushed more and more, I think their earnings will grow a lot over the coming years. The more I read into the industrial gases sector, the more profitability I see. I think any investment into any industrial gas producer is probably a good bet. There is some clear focus on the future of Hydrogen, but as you can see from production numbers, they are certainly not reliant on hydrogen sales. I think they’re perfectly equipped to continue to increase their price, and I think they’re even slightly undervalued IMO. I don’t think this is a “Get rich quick” investment, but I do think that it is one of them stocks you will wish you had bought into in 5 years time."

 My only complaint would be that in the past on days when the market gets crazy their app has been sluggish or went down completely.  I feel like it has improved lately though."
2021-04-15 20:49:22,stocks,I agree with all of that. However it should be mentioned that you have to wait no less than 1 hour to talk to the customer service agents
2021-04-16 15:09:53,stocks,I might be the exception but I've been pretty lucky with their customer service. Generally just 5-10 minute wait.
2021-04-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Best Quantum Computing stock? many people are saying different things about which stock to go for but I don't know which one is best. I just know that I am confident that quantum computing will be revolutionary once it is able to replace conventional computing. So I really want to stick my finger in the cake before its too late.  


These are the stocks and ETFs I have found recommended:  
 QTUM  
 QUBT  
 BIDU   
 GOOGL   
 TCEHY   
 MSFT"
2021-04-15 21:27:29,stocks,"Quantum physicist here. 

Quantum computing will not 'replace' classical electronics as such, but once scalable, will offer solutions to specific important NP-hard problems, or replace certain computationally intensive parts in otherwise classical algorithms e.g. in linear algebra and optimisation. Classical computers can simulate everything a quantum computer does, but will exponentially run out of essentially memory at around 50 qubits. Every time you add a coherent qubit you double the power (Hilbert space dimension). Solutions to real NP-hard problems in society will take of order 1000 logical qubits - note that the actual number of qubits in your hardware will need to be much higher due to quantum error correction and stabilizer schemes. We are not there yet.

The current cutting-edge is represented I believe by Google with their c. 50-qubit device (Nature 2019). This is amazing.

Different tech companies use different physics to construct the quantum code space. My personal favourite is Microsoft with Majoranas and creating a topologically (i.e. very strongly) protected subspace for manipulating quantum information, making the logical qubits nearly immune to decoherence. 

The problem with quantum computers is more of an engineering one, how to maintain coherence when you have thousands of qubits. The systems are incredibly fragile and decohere very easily especially as the number of qubits goes up.

IonQ and trapped ions are one popular approach as well, but my money would be on MSFT."
2021-04-16 02:00:39,stocks,I'm technically not allowed to talk about this company on this  sub as it is a pennystock but Archer Materials is making progress these companies are not. They are the worlds first that made a qubit processor chip that works on room temperature. It is still in it's early phase as the chip they made only can do a simple computation but the prototype they made was to prove it is possible in the first place. It is a deep tech company that also develops it's own nano materials and they currently have a partnership with IBM and Nvidia to further develop this quantum processor and  quantum algorithms.

So I’m wondering if I claim it on my taxes next year if I get those $700 back or if I just have to pay the price for this lesson. The stock is Tellurian."

SKLZ, FCEL, SPCE, WKHS today Hey friends, I've been considering opening a new position in 1-2 new stocks that are in the $10-20 price range (so that I can buy at least 100 shares and sell covered calls) in the above stocks. Wondering how people feel about these right now, if there's been any recent news I might've missed to explain the price action.

* SKLZ had a $24/sh offering last month, now at $15 with an amazingly low RSI.
* WKHS has been dropping since losing the contract they really needed, not much going for it at the moment?
* FCEL and SPCE are just down a lot. High risk but great short term upside?

Please tell me your thoughts on the following which I will list shares total and purchase price last year per share. I do not need the money right this second please factor in:

There will be more eventual waves of purchases I made throughout 2020 becoming eligible for lower gains tax. My goal is maximum profiteering, I invested 11.2K total with a goal of 25K in time so I guess I'm answering my own question but perhaps others have better knowledge of these individual companies as to whether they expect further gains, stagnation, or decline.

How I have combated this is with looking for stocks that I think are great value but also pay dividends. My golden goose is NYMT. It pays almost 10% annually and maintains steady price of $6/share thought thick and thin. This past year, it has fallen pretty low so I’ve just been buying it up. As far as some of the other stocks I’ve moved to: BMY, BBD, RDEIY. All 3 of these stocks I believe are not only currently undervalued and should appreciate their share prices but also pay very high dividends which I will use to offset any volatility in the stock over time. BBD and RDEIY do both suffer from not being US companies, which I feel like is why they are undervalued in the first place.

2021-04-16 03:26:08,stocks,"The idea is that you never sell because the US market historically has always gone up even in spite of crashes and corrections.

When you get closer to retirement you could sell a portion and transfer into less volatile assets like bonds.

Do be aware though that in the event of a market correction you could see VTI go down 30% or so (in a pretty much worst case scenario). Long term you'll most likely be fine but it's just something that you should be aware of.  I've been criticized for this but I recommend that everybody do their research before investing, even if it's in index funds."
2021-04-16 12:10:52,stocks,"One of the biggest benefits of investing in vti or spy *is* never selling. This allows your money to compound in a way that buying/selling does not allow due to capital gains tax. Each time you sell and buy back, the percent you paid for capital gains tax is no longer compounding.

Capital gains taxes suck"

When I sell at a loss and rebuy soon after, i can't deduct those losses from my taxes.

IF i sell at a profit and rebuy a dip, i still pay taxes.

So basically if you buy and rebuy, and its bad for you, the government doesn't really count it as a loss, but if it's good for you, they count it as a win. Seem contradictory and blatant screwing over of retail if my understanding is correct"

2021-04-15 23:54:22,stocks,but at the end of the day selling for a loss would be better if the alternative you would put your money will out return going forward.now if you believe that the next 10 years these stocks will outperform the ETFs you’d choose then makes sense not to sell
2021-04-16 01:29:23,stocks,"""why would he sell something when he has the time and money to hold it for a profit""

He should sell it if he thinks he could buy something else (like SPY or VTI) and hold it for more expected profit and less risk over the same time horizon"
2021-04-16 13:33:04,stocks,"If you buy, sell, and rebuy, the dip may have to be sizable to break even with buy and hold (unless you are in a lower tax bracket or trading in a tax sheltered account).

For example, let’s say I have $1000, buy 10 shares of a stock at $100, and sell them at $200 for $2000. At my short term capital gains rate of ~50%, I pay $500 in taxes, and now have $1500 to reinvest. If I rebuy in once the price drops to $150, I will now have 10 shares. After a 50% dip between the buy and sell points, buy-sell-rebuy is equivalent to buy and hold: in both cases I end up with 10 shares.

This is an oversimplification bc you don’t pay taxes immediately, but it’ll end up similar. Also if you are in a lower tax bracket and don’t live in CA obvi the required dip would be much less

Wash sale just means you can’t tax loss harvest if you immediately rebuy- exactly like you said. Not contradictory, but yeah fuck taxes."

2021-04-16 03:23:05,stocks,"I think it was Peter Lynch who said ""invest in what you know doesn't mean, hey I like Starbucks coffee, let's invest in them"".  

I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea to look around and see what's useful in your daily life and what other people seem to be gravitating towards and what not.  The only thing I would say is that you didn't mention looking at fundamentals or balance sheets.  

If you want to start with what you know and use every day, great!  But I recommend looking next at fundamentals and also investor presentations to see what the company's plan is going forward. Analysts can help too.  The danger with just buying what you use every day is that some of those balance sheets can be pretty ugly and some companies may not have a sustainable growth model. 

The other thing is that with your method you're probably going to get all of your exposure to US companies and large cap.  Some diversification there might help.

Last but not least, for the risk averse investor there's always index funds, as you mentioned."
2021-04-16 14:56:57,stocks,"You pay 50%? Holy shit. How do I figure mine out exactly? 

I think I am 22% for short term. I make between 40-85k and live in Nebraska. Is that correct? Seems low compared to yours so i am probably missing something. What is the state tax rule for stocks and such?"
2021-04-16 05:23:15,stocks,Google ETF’s
2021-04-16 15:46:59,stocks,"That sounds pretty much right. Nebraska also has a small state capital gains tax that equals your state income tax rate regardless of short/long term.

I live in California which has really high income taxes, so state capital gains tax is ~13% for me, and my federal income bracket tax rate (aka short term capital gains tax) is high 30s. 

So for you stock price just needs to dip ~22% between your buy and sell points for rebuying to match buy and hold."
2021-04-16 17:02:46,stocks,wouldn't it be 22% + state income tax?
2021-04-16 18:04:46,stocks,"Yup, should be minimal in Nebraska tho"
2021-04-15 20:38:18,stocks,"Hate to burst some bubbles but I think a lot of these numbers are based on unemployment claims. Many people I would imagine started on unemployment in March of last year when everything shut down. So many of these people's benefits would've run out last month. This could still lead in a rise in workers, but not necessarily, and it could be a sign of even tighter times."
2021-04-16 08:39:22,stocks,Job reports are a joke ! Because what they go by are only people that are qualified for unemployment and once your benefits run out you are not a statistic but yet millions are unemployed with no income the actual number is more than double their figures

How do you know that all of those jobs aren't getting 100's of applicants with the vast majority of people not being able to find a job? It's not like once someone applies for the job they're hired and the ad gets taken down, there'd be job ads out there even if there was a huge shortage for jobs."
2021-04-15 20:13:21,stocks,Anything related to shipping and logistics is hiring like crazy. Many parts of manufacturing too.

2021-04-15 20:21:57,stocks,"Shipping, logistics and construction are hiring like crazy and they have tons of low skill positions."
2021-04-16 07:41:46,stocks,"Youre correct.
*benefits* were extended.
*state eligibility* was not.
If you applied for benefits last year. And we’re approved. Your state *elegibilty* runs out one year from that date. They extended payments if you ran your allotted benefits out in those 12 calendar months. But they didn’t extend your *benefit year* You have to re apply. And you will not be approved if you did not work at least 12-20 weeks in the prior year. So if you were approved unemployment, and on it for a year, you cannot apply and get another year back to back. Now *federal* benefits you can still receive. 
I have four past employees on unemployment, a sister, a step brother, friends. One guy applied last year, was approved in April, state is so far behind, he hasn’t received one payment all year. He’s been working under the table this whole time, 40hrs a week. State just cut him a check for 18k for his cumulative benefit payments."

Those jobs being filled creates new jobs though. Like, those construction workers generate revenue for the company that allows them to hire more people. And those workers are going to be spending money that stimulates the economy."
2021-04-15 20:56:37,stocks,"No, it's not bad at all. But, it's getting expensive here too. Price of homes and rents have gone up quite a bit. Property taxes seem to be going up quite a bit too. 

Personally I think we should be making closer to 40-45/hr. But with low market share, my local can't price itself outta the market too. I have no complaints about my insurance package tho, and pension other than I wish pension contribution was more like 15-20% rather than 11%."
2021-04-16 08:04:01,stocks,We were cannon fodder. Once again the working/middle class got fucked while both extremes of the socio-economic spectrum were taken care of. Nothing new.
2021-04-15 20:22:48,stocks,"Oh, my personal opinion is outside the small business territory we’re talking about. I would prefer a centrally planned economy utilizing cybernetics and AI, overseen by economic planners.

Anyway you have to pay them enough to incentivize them to work, not what you believe is a great wage for the labor involved. Right now you’re counting on the printers stopping, there’s no sign of that, and in fact they’re talking about another extension of benefits."
2021-04-15 21:46:16,stocks,"Hmm. Yes, gradually over time, for the companies which are successful, but not across the board.

Let's forget the construction industry for a second. If you think about company structure in general, from a macro level, there are almost always more positions at the bottom of the pay scale, and fewer as you move up the scale towards the CEO or owner. The shape is a pyramid, essentially. And so no matter what happens, there will always be a much much greater share of positions available that pay low wages, and very few which pay well. E.g. everyone can't be a manager or executive, because the business *requires* a much greater number of low tier workers in order to operate in the first place.

The point here being with 350 million people in this country, it is literally impossible for most people to have a higher paying job. There simply aren't enough positions available that will pay higher wages, by the basic fundamental structure of the vast majority of businesses. If we look at the pyramid structure of most companies, and say that maybe 25% of jobs available pay a good wage (the upper portion of the pyramid, essentially mid level managers and above), then that means 75% of the country will be forced into low paying jobs no matter what. This is on a high level the reason why we need to raise the minimum wage, or find a solution that ties maximum pay to a ratio of minimum pay, or something similar. Otherwise there will always be this problem."
2021-04-15 21:49:26,stocks,"Hell, having any pension contribution is rare these days! Lol. But yeah I hear you."
2021-04-15 21:40:12,stocks,"That’s not what I mean. 

The government is paying people to stay home, so by default companies now have to compete with that to keep their positions filled"

2021-04-16 00:59:16,stocks,Nah man I wasn’t fortunate enough to get laid off.
2021-04-15 22:01:12,stocks,"Well higher pay is a relative measure. Its a bad goal to look at because its much easier to bring down the rich than it is to make poor wealthier. 

And earlier argued there aren't enough jobs for people working. If that was the case, restrictions on hiring low income workers(like pay ratios and hiring minimum wage) would surely make that worse. You can't simultaneously say that there aren't enough lower end jobs available and that we would make lower end workers more expensive to hire."
2021-04-15 22:13:21,stocks,"Oh yeah pensions make up such a small % of retirement accts in the US. I also have the option of starting a fully self contributed 401k plan. I'm considering doing that or a roth IRA.

We actually get 3 pensions. But the pension for our local pays out the most once vested. I want to get into investing as well."
2021-04-15 22:42:54,stocks,"I'm aware of that, my comment was intentionally sarcastic.

From my rudimentary reading, states with fewer unemployment benefits haven't experienced a swifter recovery. Could benefits have been adjusted to potentially push people to work sooner? Possibly, but I'm not an economist.

Anecdotally, everyone that I know who worked in hospitality/restaurants took their unemployment time to change career paths. Not sure where I would locate the statistics but, I wonder if that scales to impact businesses ability to rehire at nominal wages. Regardless, I'm fairly pleased with the 916,000 jobs added for March."

This makes society unbalanced. Hence we need to increase the minimum wage, OR tie maximum wage to a ratio against the minimum (like Japan does - e.g. a company can pay their CEO however much they like, as long as their lowest paid worker earns at least X% of that)."

2021-04-15 22:50:43,stocks,Right! I forgot that the only incentive in life was the difference between a living wage and an exploitative one. All the bosses who pay below a living wage did so to encourage their workers to better themselves.
2021-04-15 22:53:47,stocks,Well no the bosses didn’t because they are no more subject to capitalism than the workers are. I highly suggest you read into how economies work before you vote on anything.
2021-04-15 23:10:17,stocks,"I fully understand that is how these things function. I’m just calling those wages what they are, below a living wage and therefore exploitative.

I get it. You’re fine with business owners either running a shitty business that can’t afford to pay a proper wage, or even more greedily running a business that *could* afford to pay living wages and are just skimming all of that money for themselves off the backs of the workers. I think that’s a real shit opinion but hey look at you wearing it like a medallion."

They're petitioning the FCC to boost CBRS spectrum power output right now and I think the FCC will allow it (maybe not as high a power as they want initially). They're also petitioning the FCC (along with Michael Dell) to allow terrestrial 5g using 12GHz (MVDDS) spectrum: they have 500MHz of it in most of the country which is massive capacity. They're targeting federal and enterprise customers in addition to the consumer market and the DoD is definitely interested in 5g. They're selling themselves as the secure and national security focused brand (the feds are hugely interested in catching up to China in 5g).

Now based on some of the stuff Peter Adderton is posting it looks like they're planning to stand up a 5g SA network in Inglewood in time for next year's Super Bowl. That's confidence.

It's still speculative, but if they succeed at half of the stuff they're trying then they're trading at a huge discount to where they'll be in a few years and that's even if a Dish/DirecTV merger never happens."

2021-04-16 04:03:38,stocks,"EV is obviously the speculative and more risky play, but could be better for returns depending on how you go about it. I think the EV market is pretty saturated at the moment, personally, due to the hype around it. I'd put some of the big EV companies (TSLA being the most obvious one) at least on a watch list in case they ever return to a more reasonable price.

I did some personal DD on a series of car manufacturers about a month ago: Toyota ($147.93 at the time), Ford ($11.70), GM ($51.33), Honda ($27.67), Hyundai ($47.48), Volkswagen ($23.42), and Daimler/Mercedes ($20.03). Some key highlights that I found at the time:

- The least leveraged companies in terms of liabilities vs book value were Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota. The worst was Ford by far, followed by GM.

- In terms of price vs assets, Hyundai (P/B < 0.4) and Honda (P/B < 0.6) were selling at considerable discounts. Volkswagen was also selling at a nice valuation **at the time**, but that opportunity has very much vanished since its public EV play. 

- PEG ratios are pretty mediocre/bad across the board the last 3 years; generally speaking, these auto makers have had decreasing profits. 

- Still, most of these auto makers (except Ford) logged solid Q4 calendar profits, often the best calendar Q4 in last 3 years, suggesting that people may be spending more money on cars/parts/etc. coming out of the pandemic.



Given what's been going on with EVs and autos the last few years (at least the ones I looked at), I can see two potential plays here:

1. Bet on consumer discretionary spending as the pandemic falls back, wherein gas-OK people replace old junkers with fresh wheels or fix up what they have, and

2. Bet on whether a company will be the next one to come out and make some big EV announcement like Volkswagen did.

Either way, most of the companies I looked at seem OK financially, but growth doesn't look good over the last few years. Calendar Q4 2020 looked promising for most of the companies, but it's impossible to know if that upward trend will continue. These are just what I found, though; goes without saying, this isn't advice and be sure to do your own DD."

How long would it take? A month? 6? A year? Sure you make your money back. But taking that money and investing it it in VTI, QQQM, QQQJ, SCHD, etc... how much more could you have made? Or how much quicker could you have made that money back? That was my biggest push to rebalance. 

(Yes i know VTI, QQQ, SCHD are NOT exempt from dips or crashes. However their volatility are WAY less than individual stocks or speculative stocks.

Otherwise, people tend to buy dividend stocks because on average companies that can afford to pay one and grow it tend to be higher quality businesses that are profitable. I’m excluding things like REITs, mREITs, and BDCs that generally pay a large dividend just because of their structures. 

In a sense the availability of a dividend is a proxy for a higher quality business. Dividend stocks tend to do well not because they pay a dividend but because of those innate qualities. In the end, dividends are just an allocation of capital. Either they pay it out to you, causing a taxable event you can’t refuse, or they can reinvest it or buy back shares, things that will also hopefully benefit you as a shareholder."

Fiat such as the USD is whatever the public collective believe it to be. Just like Bitcoin. It costs money to run and maintain the USD. I would argue it costs more to run than it does Bitcoin. It is just a lot harder to quantitate since there are so many factors that go into running, maintaining, and using the USD.

2021-04-16 00:46:25,stocks,"Because although it is technically about a stock, it's a lot more, we have a global crisis that all revolves around lanthomides. Any talk about mp as a stock has all these articles that seem to compare it to a lithium or coal mine when the rare ore in there are more precious now than anything and threatens to send us back to the dark ages if they successfully bring mp down. I was hoping to get some support but I wasn't really sure where else to go and I wanted to break out of the ""this stock is a good investment"" thing although it is, it's such a massive understatement.

Any chance we have of industrialising and fulfilling on the promise of a reignition of the technological revolution across the globe but especially in the United States is solely dependent on the success of that operation not even as a stock, but due to circumstances the way you'd sabotage it is by attacking the stock out of no where.

I knew it'd be attacked today so I was hoping to urge for support beyond mere investment, but also because it's crucial that we defend the only source of lanthomides this side of the globe while China is running dry which only made things worse because Myanmar had its mind captured and whatever China could get by on there is now cut off. So they're pressured to potentially spark a war out of shear desperation... Meanwhile any coverage just kinda makes it seem like yet another mine. What's the big deal... 

China Sabre rattling via militias and threatening Vietnam and the pacific rim alliance is due to how their industry will grind to a halt, this is what's causing the global electronic components shortage. This is why Myanmar was seized. It's of such significance it's hard to even explain without covering what it is were taking about beyond the stock.

Without that rare ore, which is not just one element but the entire 7th row of the periodic table we wouldn't be able to produce electricity anymore beyond spending the batteries we have left. Every power generator that's of any significance, even nuclear would no longer work if we no longer had lanthomides to convert the mass energy of the spinning turbines into electricity.

The very basis of generating electricity in any meaningful amount beyond shocking people with static and the extremely limited amount we can get from solar panels which are basically just half batteries and wear out and lose efficiency with heat just like any other battery. The panels need to be replaced once they're worn out which creates more toxic landfill waste when with lanthomides any mass can be converted into energy the same way e = mc2 tells us that mass is the most potent form of energy. Solar panels are the least. 

I keep using a subwoofer as an example because it's a simple motor and all motors also represent electric generators. Among the lanthomide row, the 7th row of the periodic table are what we make magnets out of, but also so much more.

But think of the force that a giant magnet and an alternating current creates where by just pistoning a diaphragm you can shake a house apart. Now think of if we couldn't take for granted that we could make magnets anymore. To generate the same amount of force would be impossible even with quadruple the power, since the propulsive and attractive force of the giant magnet is so powerful it does most the work without even needing to take any power. That same exact principle is used backward to convert the inertial mass of anything from turbines to pumps to generate electricity and that again is just one use of lanthomides, they're also used to make numerous electronics components, even lasers, and the screen you're looking at.

I have a feeling people don't want to generate panic but the fact that Myanmar was seized and now China is trying to encroach on the Asian pacific to seek out anything they can while Vietnam and the pacific alliance at this moment are facing off in a Mexican stand off that would threaten to suck us all into a world War.

The reason why the United States has such a limited robotics industry to the point where Hollywood rents/buys its professional drones from China, the reason why they have more mag lev than the rest of the world while we can't even get a high speed rail and musk tried claiming we'd use air like a air hockey table instead but that would never work and more than a decade and billions worth of grants siphoned away from much more interesting realistic projects that don't get any attention, we get the 30mph led tunnel in Las Vegas.

KEF the Apple of speaker manufacturers had to move operations to China because that's where the parts are produced. The hardware capitol of the world is in China because we've been relying on them to produce electronic components including the various magnetic components that allowed them to progress so quickly.

We expect to reindustrialise and we naturally see sustainable energy tech as one of the main sparks but none of it would be possible without lanthomides. Every single concept for modern sustainable energy system relies on lanthomides, every single generator would need plenty, the reason why subwoofers are so expensive and why backup generators are so expensive isn't because they are hard to mass produce, it's because like diamonds, the larger and higher quality the magnet the more exponentially expensive it becomes especially now that the main global supplier has announced they are running out, so they even bought in a 15 percent non voting stake in mp and are relying on us to get mp going again.

From the days of Tesla roving around in exhibits showing off electricity to the birth of the modem age up until the 70s we produced our own electronic components and high quality magnets which made us so innovative. Lanthomides directly manipulate electrons in a way that nothing else can. So while MP is represented as something like a lithium mine, lithium would be worthless without lanthomides to charge them into chemical batteries, but you know the traveling exhibitions Tesla had? You know the electric street cars that we used to have? They didn't even need lithium, ni cad, or any chemical battery. Power plants have these long cylinders we think of in our minds but it's seldom talked about but those are mechanical batteries and they are used as backup power and are much more space efficient, high capacity, and even sustainable and can be designed to work indefinitely, and are usually stacked into cylinders and they convert pure momentum into power similar to how a pendulum works but in 3d so you can charge them up with as much power as you want and produce no emissions waste or anything harmful.

There are so many things we don't have, all this opportunity cost that's invisible to us because we settled on another way, a consumable, which to be fair is useful for small devices but for larger things we can create electric boats that just like race cars stabilize themselves with the gyroscopic momentum of the engine. Cars become more and more efficient toward 60mph because the engine actually starts to become a mechanical battery and begins to store power offsetting the need for more gas that makes city driving less efficient.

We can have boats that are not only powered by mechanical batteries but also use the battery to keep the boat completely stationary on axis no matter how wavy and windy it is.

We just don't do any of these because we rely on one nation to produce even all the speaker drivers and they didn't have the limitations which is how they got to have the fastest and largest scale and most efficient mag lev circuit in the world while we ponder the logistics and gave up on even SDI, Reagan's star wars program because we just couldn't have China make it all for us. A magnetic propulsion tunnel would be so useful, we'd even be able to zip small satellites into outer space using no rocket fuel.

All the things you think of and go ""hmm... I wonder why we don't have that"" is because the giant asteroid caused the pacific rim and over time created these pockets of enriched lanthomides that we just take for granted while also aren't aware of how not having our own source is the reason why we don't have all the things you think we should have by now and we switched to a ""service economy"" which was not a good plan. 

Just like chemical batteries we find work arounds and so Disney land as a safeguard uses air pressure to slow a dropping ride when it could use specialized magnets and be much more reliable.

We bicker over how solar panels aren't efficient and frankly barely world because the alternative would be that we begin to source our own lanthomides again and we have the largest mine in the western hemisphere. Calling it a mine is something I'm planning on writing them about because it isn't a mine, it's technically a field laboratory and they really ought to do more to let the public know that. Rather than just saying ""were a different kind of mine"". Sure they do, as the foundation to any industrial operation: mine, but it's not like mining lithium, uranium, or even iron to make steel, the ore they are mining is basically real life vibranium which is why they also have an r and d department to research and discover new ways to use lanthomides. You can make super conductors that can achieve quantum locking. Have you ever seen how much that further demonstrates how lanthomide ore IS vibranium?

We take it for granted but it's come to a point where the nation that's been refining and producing vibranium into all the amazing things is running out. MP is a whole figurative gold mine of vibranium except a gold mine is lame by comparison. 

Tldr we have a secret vibranium mine, China takes it seriously enough because they've been tasked with working with it for the last 50 years. We haven't been which has stalled our progress in so many ways that we just presume is normal, like we just didn't want to advance anymore on purpose"
2021-04-16 01:21:58,stocks,"If we want to progress we need the mountain pass project which consists of a resource that's as close to vibranium as exists irl, we take it for granted because we just get products like refrigerator magnets as neodymium, one of the lanthomides, but even that tiny sample we instinctively as kids find endlessly fascinating.

Imagine being presented with a lode stone, what was called the philosopher's stone in alchemy, first you'd realize it attracts certain metals, but as an alchemist you go further and realize it also does things that are way more interesting and seems like more than a coincidence that the most precious metals are not iron or even Damascus steel when it was first imported but good silver and copper. The 3 most electronically conductive metals are the three we have always considered precious metals.

Silver is the most conductive on its own but tarnishes slowly, copper is less conducive but is more common but also tarnishes with an interesting jade patina, gold is the top even though we have nickel brass and all sorts of other metals and has the properties of never tarnishing and is nearly as conductive as silver.

Our coins are not made of gold, but silver was seen as the most expensive over nickel even and copper..

We discovered aluminum by refining bauxite in the 40s but no doubt that would have been the 4th universal precious metal, it's discovery allowed us to make lasers due to how luminous aluminum is in the sense that when polished it's the most reflective of all the metals and that discovery unlocked the door to technology like lasers and mirror lenses for the hubble that have to be polished under ground in a completely silent isolated chamber otherwise even a plane flying by will be imprinted unto the mirror.

Material science hinges around discovery of materials but the entire basis of the modern world is has a boring name: rare earth minerals. Sounds like a dietary supplement. By the way just like vibranium cerium also inhibits and fights cancer tumors.

See why I don't really want to emphasize the stock in itself so much? Just like being born into the golden age of antibiotics, a panacea that has saved my and plenty of other people's lives, but we treat it like it's Tylenol.

The beginning of the electronics age was the beginning of our mastery over ""vibranium"" ore I e. Lanthomides. And we really have barely cracked the surface due to how we just haven't really been working at it 

MP is a stock, but it's not just any stock, it's a crucial operation and it already has its own Wakandan style vibranium lab that is actively researching what other possibilities we can unlock to achieve applications that are the stuff that stories of magic in fables come from:

https://youtu.be/CzlxEIMuNEk

https://youtu.be/LS3GQk9ETRU


So I was hoping I could get people to understand how crucial this is, and I have the feeling that the reason why it's not really emphasized is because it's really significant. I knew there were a bunch of put options due tomorrow and the stock has been botted constantly to make it seem like it's not doing well since if people see the price signal go down many will presume it's some bad news that's being hidden from them and think the worse or second guess themselves even thought literally nothing happened but a giant put option is due tomorrow and they just botted it down all day. they weren't even sly it looks unnatural af.

Check this out: you can see the bots literaly take a lunch break and go refill by running a pump and dump.

Human beings don't spam 00 at the end of every order. Look at the ratio of bots to humans during the perfectly level ""sell off"" a day before the giant put was set to expire at 35. 

https://imgur.com/a/2LKmlyS

Look at when the bots went to lunch. You can see the price signals begin returning to where we expect it to be, it's ridiculously undervalued. Check out the lists. They're from when it's being botted versus the lunch break where you can see human type orders with numbers that would be how people would actually bid and ask where they aren't just the same double 0 orders over and over again.

I was hoping to get people to understand the true value and preparing them for the bot attack, which is why in the addendum I said you could even just okay defense by setting your limit low and get it at a discount. It looks like people were trying as you can see from the lunch break, but the speed and coordination of the bots and their ability to beat your bid by half a cent and sell it back to you all but makes it seem impossible for us to even affect the price signals when its being botted.

The float is 18 percent, so if we buy and hold we can definitely take control and I'm sure MP is going to be a very worthwhile investment in too of all that.

It's very manipulated and vaguely described since  these times it's about recognizing true value versus hype and price signal manipulation.

I want to work for these guys, I'm pretty excited about what they're working on and the vision of a futuristic mine / vibranium lab."

2021-04-16 01:49:48,stocks,First time putting money in the stock market today! My gut told me when I saw it at 22.49 (big dip) to buy 50 shares. Then bought 50 more at 29. Still holding all 100 shares and will be watching it like a hawk tomorrow. Got my super optimistic about trading more regularly that’s for sure!

2021-04-16 16:16:37,stocks,"That’s a claim Astra makes loudly but doesn’t really stand up to scrutiny.

Astra was previously Ventions, founded in 2005 (a year before Rocket Lab), and was re-named Astra in 2016. By that metric, they’ve been going for 16 years and still haven’t reached orbit. Rocket Lab reached orbit in 2018 - 12 years after founding. Astra are 33% slower already and still falling behind, if measuring from founding date.

Rocket Lab was an aerospace technology research company from 2006. They worked on engine technology for customers like Darpa and did sounding rockets. 
Rocket Lab only started developing their orbital rocket (Electron) in 2014. Their orbital rocket program took them 4 years from clean sheet to reaching orbit in 2018.
Astra have spent 4 years, and 5 failed launches, in their project to build an orbital rocket, and have still not demonstrated orbital capability (despite their explicit, and untrue, claims to the contrary). They continue to fall behind.

By any measure, Astra are SLOWER to market than Rocket Lab."
2021-04-16 16:18:26,stocks,"They were over 1000 miles per hour too slow to reach orbit. 1000mph is a very big “barely”, especially for a rocket not even carrying a customer’s satellite"
2021-04-16 16:18:40,stocks,1000 miles is 1609.34 km
2021-04-16 19:23:29,stocks,Thank you for your input. I’m invested in both Astra and Rocket Lab and hope they both succeed
2021-04-16 00:21:23,stocks,yeah i’m thinking look if i can borrow at a rate of 2.5% and put that into the s&p and QQQ over the long run should way more than make up for the cost of servicing the debt
2021-04-16 02:44:44,stocks,"Goodluck, I hope you dont blow up your portfolio though.  I still think this market has a lot of upside left.  The Great Reopening coupled with April traditionally being a great month for stocks.  You also have jobless claims that blasted expectations, retail sales that are killing it, bond yields dropping, and the Fed maintaining low rates all year.  If there is a correction, I'm just not seeing it in the next few months"
2021-04-16 08:24:38,stocks,"Agree and don’t think we are entering a significant correction but do think we are more than due for a 4-5% pull back. 

1. YTD: S&P 500 is up 11% (we can’t keep this pace) 

2. MTD: S&P 500 is up 5%.  So this means that 46% of the year to date gains have been realized in the last 10 trading days (removed weekends and one holiday).  

Can I be wrong YES, however statistically speaking the pull back is increasingly more likely than an additional surge.  Moved all my puts deep in the money to May & June expirations.  This would allow me to keep averaging if it keeps going up."
