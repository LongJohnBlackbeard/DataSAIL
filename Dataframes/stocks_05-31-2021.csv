2021-05-31 19:15:59,stocks,Plus the interest rate/tapering FUD. We all know Jerome ain’t pulling the rug. His kicking the can til he deploys his CBDC. We ain’t stupid 🤑😉
2021-05-31 19:29:14,stocks,"add forward p/e of dow of damn near 30 times.  https://www.wsj.com/market-data/stocks/peyields.  I remember when we would dump most stocks at 20 p/e, and short them at 25 p/e.  All good news, and then some, has been priced in....  Mkt volatility high (VIX low) and a global pandemic.  Hmm, can you hear from the grave those two famous words.....  Irrational exuberance..."
2021-05-31 19:19:41,stocks,"Square is going to be a monster, you could hedge your bets and buy both"
2021-05-31 17:42:14,stocks,Fuck me. I just placed a big bet on sofi.
2021-05-31 18:26:59,stocks,"JPM. If you want stability with your current picks. But you said not diverse so stick to the theme. Go SQ.
Better longterm growth. Want to capture both in a way.
Go V Love that stock. Caveat to advice here. I own SQ and V"
2021-05-31 18:42:56,stocks,"I think SQ has the higher upside, but also a much higher downside.  

JPM will be a consistent gainer for the foreseeable future, that has yet to be determined for SQ.  

I have both (SQ since it was under $20), but if I had to pick one I'd pick JPM, I generally value consistency and safety over boom/bust picks.  I also would rather have my money with Jamie Dimon (JPM CEO) vs Jack Dorsey (SQ CEO)."
2021-05-31 18:50:49,stocks,"I’m a crypto shill so take this with a grain of salt but I think there’s little long term(5+ years) potential with banks. I think fintech (sq, pypl, coin) make a lot more sense from a long term perspective"
2021-05-31 18:43:29,stocks,"JPM is a safe bet. But if you really like payment companies, you could go to Visa, Amex, or Master Card - those three have economies of scale and network effect advantage which protect their market share in the long run."
2021-05-31 18:15:30,stocks,"Banks will benefit, while growth stocks, like Square, will be impacted as interest rates increase in the next few years."
2021-05-31 19:31:04,stocks,Jpm
2021-05-31 18:41:38,stocks,"Personally JPM for the stable growth, SQ for the volatile growth.

Both quality companies (off these 2 I only on SQ but I see JPM as a quality boomer company)"
2021-05-31 19:40:56,stocks,square...
2021-05-31 17:42:05,stocks,I see SQ being higher growth and also the safer option. They are moving into different sectors within the business community. SQ will be the new JPM when it’s all said and done.
2021-05-31 18:46:55,stocks,"jpm's aversion to crypto has a chance to really hurt them long term. the writing is on the wall that banks are going to have to deal with crypto in order to compete, and anyone not buying it now is going to simply have to pay more to buy it later. this inherently puts SQ in a much stronger position.

yes, they technically have a crypto-less ""crypto offering"", but it's a [scam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JnGDUDDLNM). now, is jpm going to disappear? unlikely. but they might be flat where as other options will grow. i have zero jpm in my portfolio and zero interest in changing that."
2021-05-31 19:54:38,stocks,"Why don't you want your portfolio to be diverse?  Not implying it's wrong just against conventional wisdom.

I went with ETFs like IYG and FINX."
2021-05-31 18:46:10,stocks,"Hi. Not to hijack this discussion, but why JPM over WFC?  WFC seems to be trading at a better price. 

I have V already and am thinking of adding a bank."
2021-05-31 18:00:45,stocks,I think you did the right thing. SQ is a good company but the stock price is way too high.
2021-05-31 17:48:23,stocks,Why do you like sofi??
2021-05-31 18:45:05,stocks,I have V as well and love it.
2021-05-31 19:50:38,stocks,can i borrow your crystal ball when you are done with it?
2021-05-31 19:28:16,stocks,"Did they say how much crypto they've actually bought? They may only have bought very small positions, relative to their other holdings. If I had to guess, they'll probably buy as it falls, increasing that position, but I feel like those working at JP Morgan have enough sense to buy into a holding slowly"
2021-05-31 19:52:31,stocks,"Bank, making decisions that hurt them in the long run? 😅"
2021-05-31 19:12:40,stocks,"Jpm has been a proven winner with Dimon at the helm. It's actually outperformed the s&p going back a long ways.

Wfc not as so, however with new leadership in place and other things that may change. That said jpm is still the gold standard of American banks."
2021-05-31 16:04:52,stocks,No you didn't.  APPL doesn't exist.
2021-05-31 16:24:53,stocks,If you don’t expect a short term return then you’ll be more than fine with AAPL in the long term. Turn DRIP on for AAPL and just let it build up.
2021-05-31 17:27:46,stocks,I think that’s a perfect investment. Now that you have a solid base begin to diversify and research other companies to invest in. Maybe covered calls since you have enough shares.
2021-05-31 17:14:33,stocks,"I thought this was more a WSB post, where they......actually would also flame you, but just in the other direction that you should have bet harder and more.

Ain't nothing wrong having some conviction in a stock you like, maybe consider a middle ground, diversify some and overweight AAPL a bit."
2021-05-31 18:48:34,stocks,"Legitimately, this could work for you. However, I recommend looking at the historic chart, and compute how much money you would lose or gain if it goes to certain price targets. If it drops to $100, you may lose $4000. If it goes to $145, you may gain $3000. Are these risks that you are willing to take, because emotionally it can be difficult to watch that money. Mathematically, if you can stomach it, I think all in AAPL for long term is a totally legitimate strategy"
2021-05-31 18:10:58,stocks,What do you mean tied in a house? Did you sell a house or take a HELOC to invest?
2021-05-31 16:13:39,stocks,"The question is really how much it can outperform the overall market vs how much more risk you are taking on by holding one stock vs a whole index.  I am slowly rotating out of some individual stocks and going into VTI, VOO, QQQ, and ARKK for more high growth innovation exposure.  Will AAPL outperform the SP500, how about ARKK?  It's really hard to predict"
2021-05-31 18:35:26,stocks,"I suggest you hold when the fundamentals are strong, then buy lots you can afford on dips. And never panic. I try to purchase lots when dips sink below my cost basis."
2021-05-31 18:55:46,stocks,"Dude you couldn’t even list the right ticker, you’re going places"
2021-05-31 18:31:37,stocks,Put all in one basket. One word: diversify
2021-05-31 16:46:49,stocks,"Take part of the rest of the money you have and spread it out a bit. It doesn’t mean you have to be boring. Buy some high dividend stocks like CAPL or USAC. Buy some other blue chips and build them up over time. Research some penny stocks and invest a small amount there. But, that is, only if you’re interested in learning how the market works and enjoy it. My guess is, otherwise, you’re going to get bored just watching AAPL and wondering if you really can hold it for five years. Just my two cents"
2021-05-31 19:13:02,stocks,good choice
2021-05-31 16:22:17,stocks,"I am heavily in apple and honestly it may get rough in the Short term. I wouldn’t rush into anything, research the companies you believe in and wait for the opportunity to invest in them. The fed has to raise interest rates which should make entry points much more palatable. Apple is the best there is, they are the best at what they do"

2021-05-31 19:23:09,stocks,You can't go wrong with aapl if your long on it.  This company is a cash printer.  Price action sucks lately but don't sell at a loss you good.
2021-05-31 18:22:28,stocks,Definitely average down when it dips to $90
2021-05-31 18:24:34,stocks,"I bought aapl at $298, $268 and $212 on 2/26/2020, all the way to the second week of March 2020, pre split ( which means I averaged at around $74.00 after split) didn’t regret for a second."
2021-05-31 16:20:15,stocks,"Diversity your portfolio, but that doesn't mean be boring like half the people are here. You can manage a portofolio without doing lame ETFS."
2021-05-31 16:39:55,stocks,"On a risk-adjusted basis this is a very dumb play, no matter how it turns out"
2021-05-31 16:35:17,stocks,"> Went against general sentiment here and purchased 20K worth of APPL. This is my first stock purchase ever. 


I see. So you felt like you were smarter/better/more experienced than everyone else. 



>  (I was scared it would jump, if I sat around waiting for a targeted stock price). 


So you bought in based off FOMO. 


> But Idk, APPL's trendy and seems, almost criminally, underrated. 


It’s worth $2.03 trillion.....



> I plan to @ least hold this investment for 5 years, maybe longer.


I guarantee you’ll panic sell. You panic bought, you’ll panic sell. Learn to control your emotions. 



> Again, I'm a novice. Help me find da way. I do have another 10-15K or so (not my emergency fund, I promise) just sitting around in a savings account. I am tempted to double DWN if APPL dips.


I wouldn’t. You’re already overweight in AAPL, even if you bought an index fund. Keep in mind AAPL makes up around 6% of VOO. 



> APPL

Ohhh. It’s a joke post lmao. Cos there’s no such ticker. 


Not financial advice."

2021-05-31 18:08:56,stocks,I'd ask a financial advisor first? Not random people on a Reddit board! But hey that's just me.
2021-05-31 16:08:40,stocks,Honestly APPL would’ve been a way better ticker
2021-05-31 17:33:59,stocks,"Weird, it used to. That was the ticker for Appell Petroleum. It looks like they were de-listed in 2016."
2021-05-31 16:07:04,stocks,"I think you know what they mean, is pretty funny to mess up the ticker on a 20k purchase tho 😂"
2021-05-31 17:43:44,stocks,AAPL dividends blow. You’ll get about 1 share a year with 20k worth.

2021-05-31 17:28:45,stocks,Yeah but AAPL shows up higher in alphabetically ordered lists
2021-05-31 18:36:37,stocks,Did you know that ARKK has significantly outperformed AAPL over the last 5 years?  With a 2 trillion dollar market cap is it really that easy to say it will outperform over the next 5?  I think ARKK will continue to outperform the market. That is with the current correction also
2021-05-31 18:30:50,stocks,Oi govna would ye let an ol peasant pass?
2021-05-31 16:23:33,stocks,"Lol, you wish"
2021-05-31 19:01:41,stocks,"As we all know, it's better to invest in companies that are ranked higher alphabetically. Is that what they mean when they refer to 'generating alpha' ?"
2021-05-31 18:44:24,stocks,A lot of that growth was due to the outrageous run that TSLA and BTC had last year. Even Cathie says those mega returns are not sustainable. Can ARK outperform the market again? Sure. Can it do it every year? No way. The “innovation” sector is all about high risk / high reward. Some years ARK will be pummeled in losses.

2021-05-31 15:51:58,stocks,Understanding macroeconomics is huge. The state of the economy often effects money politics and the behaviour of central banks. Rise in inflation and interest rates have a straight impact on the stock market.

2021-05-31 16:15:33,stocks,Exactly. It is so essential for any investor and anyone for that matter. With the current rates on the rise everyone should know what is bound to come.

2021-05-31 16:19:58,stocks,I like to think investing is a boxing match against your greedy worse self. You need these traits to beat him.

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/091813/which-order-use-stoploss-or-stoplimit-orders.asp

Stop sells it no matter what when it drops below $7. With stop limit, you could say sell when it drops to $7, but don't sell if it has dropped past another number you set (like $6.50 for example)."
2021-05-31 17:16:19,stocks,"Also note that some brokers treat stop orders on options differently than stocks. With my broker the trigger price for a stop sell on an option is the ask, and for a stop buy to close the trigger price is  the bid. I still don’t know why they do this.  The point is if you enter a stop limit at the same price it likely won’t execute since by the time it triggers your limit price will be above the bid. I’ve started just using stops without limits and subtracting the current spread from my stop price to compensate."

2021-05-31 14:27:49,stocks,"I don’t understand the upside to selling. From what I have read, Dutch auction typically lands at average of offer range (would be 59.5 in this example).  That means offering up your shares could easily result in -2.3/per share while the max upside is +1.2/per share based on current stock price. Wouldn’t people be better off just selling at 61.8 at market if they want out?"

2021-05-31 15:29:41,stocks,"Best time to start was 10 years ago, next best time is today, welcome to the party. When you use the term ""app"" what you probably actually want to know is what brokerage you should use, i.e. the company that actually processes your transactions, manages your cash deposits, etc. They all provide generally the same ability to buy and sell stocks, open different kinds of accounts, transfer cash from your bank, etc.

Robinhood for example has a great app, however the actual brokerage part is kind of crappy, without going too far into the weeds. As other users have said, fidelity is a decent choice. I personally use TD ameritrade, they have a simple client and you can also use the much more featured (but more complex) thinkorswim client.

Most brokers provide ""commission free"" trades for stocks traded on the major exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE, CHX, etc.) You won't pay a fee on top of the price of the stock, however the broker makes their money through various methods that are beyond the scope of this post. If you want to invest in small or foreign companies not traded on major exchanges, you will likely have to pay some fixed fee per transaction."

2021-05-31 15:56:42,stocks,I was going to ask the same question. I'm tired of robinhood and the shenanigans.
2021-05-31 16:05:24,stocks,Most apps are good as long as they don’t stop you from buying a stock during a squeeze because they’re in bed with hedge funds

2021-05-31 15:27:55,stocks,"Honestly, I partly agree with the sentiment of avoiding Robinhood for those reasons. At the same token the whole Robinhood fiasco was based around specific, highly speculative, volatile and “gambling” like companies. Meaning, if you were buying at the time you would’ve lost a lot of money whether they pulled the plug for a day or two or not. It was wrong of Robinhood to do that but at the same time, the people buying those “investments”were gambling, not investing. If you’re planning to invest (long term), that shouldn’t be a big issue. Plus, it’s a great platform to get your ‘feet wet’ before diving into more complex ones. There’s also public which is really simple to use and doesn’t prioritize institutional order flow. Webull is great too. I go over each platform in the video. Personally, if I was starting all over again, I would start accounts with each financial/investing app and see which I like better.

The reasons: 1. you get to try each app and see which you like better
2. You get familiarized with fees/or lack there of
3. You also get a bunch of free money and stocks that you can transfer into the platform you decide type like the most
4. If you use someone’s link for each, you help someone else get some free cash along side yourself.

Hope that helps! 😊🙌"

2021-05-31 18:52:22,stocks,"when you place an order on Robinhood (or Schwab, or Fidelity), they have a deal with designated market makers who take your order and fill it

market makers are the guys making pennies off the spread between the bid / ask of a stock by providing liquidity. they will buy MSFT at $230.5 and sell it at $231, for example (i made up the numbers). this is how the market works nowadays. in the vast majority of cases you arent buying the stock from another ordinary investor like yourself, you're buying it from a professional market maker with a computer keeping up a constant bid / ask

in Robinhood's case, most of their order flow goes to Citadel, one of the biggest market making firms in the world. they're getting hundreds of thousands of orders from Robinhood and making a few pennies off every transaction involving shares, and more for options. they pay Robinhood a fee for the traffic

in the past Robinhood did get sued because as a broker they're supposed to try and find the best deal for their clients. and by directing it all to one company (Citadel) obviously the clients may not have been paying the best price. they're better now, with more flow going to other market makers, but this is still what most ppl get hung up on

personally i really dont care. i would rather lose a few pennies on the transaction than pay commission fees. if you're buying 10 shares of MSFT it really doesnt matter. if you're buying 100,000 shares of MSFT then it might start mattering"

2021-05-31 14:02:21,stocks,"both are overvalued due to the covid-hangover. I don't se how low-margin retail chains can justify this high of PE. It's not like Costco can open 50% more store every year for the next 5 years.

PE of COST has been climbing precipitously from 10 (2010) to now around 38 while its profit margin has stayed flat since inception. This is a screaming ""NO"" and the elevated price is more a result of retail investor piling in to me. I expect a slow bleeding of costco stock price for the next several quarters."

2021-05-31 00:00:00,stocks,"Quick glance at VZIO  

Vizio is an American company founded in Orange County California in 2002. It focuses on producing smart televisions, sound bars, and accessories.It also operates Platform+ that comprises SmartCast, a Smart TV operating system, enabling a fully integrated home entertainment solution, and data intelligence and services products through Inscape. Its SmartCast delivers content and applications through an easy-to-use interface, as well as supports streaming apps and hosts its free ad-supported video app, WatchFree, as well as VIZIO Free Channels. In addition, the company provides support for third-party voice platforms.

Sector: Consumer Goods/Electronics

Vizio went public 03/25/2021 at 21$ since then it ranged from $17.25-$28.80 and currently sits at $21.84.

Market cap of $4B with 2020 sales of $2.04B and a P/E ratio of 40.

Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million. With a forecasted annual earnings increase of 46.9%

Vizio has no debt compared to 5 years ago when its debt to equity ratio was 89.4%.

Short term assets ($750.8M) exceed its short term liabilities ($523.4M).

Gross profit increased 82% year over year to $86.7 million 

Net income declined 64% year over year to $3.3 million. (Vizio attributes this to problems with importing goods during the pandemic)   

SmartCast Active Accounts grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million

Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52

Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million 

One potential issue is Smartcast is only 3 years old and is not as well known as Roku, Amazon firestick or apple tv. People could opt for what the know rather than give smartcast a shot.

Vizio has strong financials and is focusing more on the ad revenue generated by smartcast. I don’t have much stake in Vizio but I do see potential. With some volume this stock can move."

2021-05-31 11:10:44,stocks,"I understand that but we talk about 30 years. It's not the world but a lot can happen. Japan used to have 40-50% market share, nowadays its only 8-10%. While that doesn't mean you would have lost being solely invested into that (e.g. if everything else just outgrew them) it still means you are limited only to the performance of that singular country. 

But another person noted 5% of the spy is actually not from the US and expects global coverage to grow in the SP500, do that sounds better. I will probably bump that one up and lower the world one."
2021-05-31 17:15:35,stocks,"Same, but it's nothing I would put more than 2% in. Cathie is a competent investor who had solid years and the hate against her recently is not justified in my opinion. She took less profits for years to shine when growth is rocketing, and that will repeat most likely until the end of the time. 

That said growth is the opposite of low risk or coverage:p"
2021-05-31 11:25:17,stocks,"VTI+VXUS have more companies than VT alone, and having both VTI+VXUS lets you be able to rebalance it in the long run, for example the last 1-2 decades VXUS underperfom VTI by alot, but is projected to be the other way arround next decade.."
2021-05-31 11:58:24,stocks,I also believe there are some foreign tax credit implications. VXUS gives you foreign tax credit. VT doesn’t.  Not 100% sure on this one so welcome any corrections.
2021-05-31 15:07:53,stocks,VT has higher fee than VTI+VXUS.  VXUS also has a higher fee than VEA+VWO.    Holding VTI+VEA+VWO is best option regarding fees and also allows more customization as most would prefer higher % in emerging.
2021-05-31 13:57:50,stocks,Yes! And this particular etf also has been a growth etf as well. So the value of the etf goes up and you get paid a div.
2021-05-31 10:14:36,stocks,"In the last decade unless you're in China, emerging markets been meh.

LATAM/eastern EU is just too politically volatile. Not worth it especially SPY would've given you 500%."
2021-05-31 10:33:42,stocks,"It's only 'declining' relative to the rest of the world... because it is difficult to sustain such an enormous lead.  It's economy is still expanding by ~4% per year on average, and has more than doubled since 2000.

If you want to see an actual declining power, look to Japan."
2021-05-31 10:13:48,stocks,"20 or so of the S&P 500 companies aren't based in the US. Most of those were added in the last ten years so the trend is likely to continue.

It's an increasingly global economy. Being based in the US doesn't mean it's only relevant in the US."
2021-05-31 10:48:24,stocks,"Oh thank you so much I understood it.
Appreciate it"
2021-05-31 14:09:28,stocks,"What's the problem with just ask? 
Reddit kids lile you, are the biggest bunch of snarky douche bags:/"
2021-05-31 13:13:24,stocks,Im Canadian and cant seem to find any vxus is all.
2021-05-31 10:30:00,stocks,"My only goal right now is to park my money with the least risk over a long period of 30 years. I don't know what will happen to the US in that time period and I don't want to be locked in there if something happens. I am more than fine to have less returns than with SPY, for me that's like arguing whether to invest into penny stocks or growth stocks or value stocks, though I still have a position in the SP500 I'm adding to. It's just a way smaller part. I've been very lucky with stupid trades and sold most of my stocks I've been holding for 2-5 years in January/February, so now I'm looking for the best way to secure it while maintaining growth over the years to come"
2021-05-31 16:40:13,stocks,Well good thing we’re not going back in time to invest 10 years ago.
2021-05-31 10:16:34,stocks,"I checked that online and it says that it only has US listed companies and 72% of the generated income is from the US. of course they can still do sales worldwide, but isn't that still limited to companies in the US? So let's say China would fully take over marker share like the US did in the past, then it wouldn't matter if the US is globally active if the main deal is somewhere else?"
2021-05-31 14:13:11,stocks,because they would've gotten the answer in 0.2 seconds flat instead of asking other people to spell it out for them???
2021-05-31 16:57:08,stocks,"Sounds like you want a SPY hedge strategy.

""cash in long term treasuries"" (aka bonds) is the obvious choice. market goes down, interest rate goes down, bond prices goes up, and now you got cash to re-invest.

Gold is also a good hedge. not complicated, buy gold miners, gold producers, actual gold. Gold goes up in a down market as investors seek out safe havens.

alternatively (breaking the rule here.. but).. invest in a stablecion basket
Entire point of hedge is to put cash into something with LOW or NEGATIVE correlation with the overall market (beta), it doesn't matter if you believe or don't believe in. For the last 10 years, cyrpot (mixed up spelling to bypass the filter) has been acting as a zero to negative beta hedge against the market. Basically it's an asset that does its own thing completely unrelated to the overall stock market. BUT, it's highly volatile, so you gotta time the peak, hence the basket approach may be best."
2021-05-31 16:57:19,stocks,Least risk would be cash my dude.
2021-05-31 10:42:51,stocks,"As far as I know, ""US listed"" just means stocks available on a US market. Tons of non-US stocks are listed in the US.

In the S&P 500:

12 companies are headquartered in Ireland

6 are in the UK

3 are in the Netherlands

3 are in Switzerland

1 is in Bermuda

So a total of 5% of companies, and likely to continue growing.

China taking that level of market share is very, very much an 'if'  and plenty of western companies are already present in or are expanding into foreign markets, up to and including China. Depending on how international tensions shake out, I wouldn't be surprised to start seeing Chinese companies entering US indices, either. Edit: There are a few Chinese companies in the NASDAQ 100 already.

To me, it isn't worth the lower returns and higher fees offered by all-world or ex-US funds in the meantime, and if China does attain that level of prominence on a global level or the US falls from grace that hard, there are probably going to be bigger things to worry about than the value of your retirement account."
2021-05-31 14:18:17,stocks,"Yup, googling it is faster, but who cares?

Not everyone is as jaded as you. Alot of people enjoy answering questions. 

Maybe this person had googled the term, and wanted a more human/colloquial explantion? Not exactly a crime..."
2021-05-31 17:12:37,stocks,"No no, I don't want to bet against SPY, my point is rather when e.g. let's say China becomes the dominant stock market and USA dries out for whatever reason then SPY will tank and start moving mostly sideways (not down) because of way less growth - or at least way less than somewhere else. My only goal is to not be limited by one country even if that means overall less return but being prepared for when it happens"
2021-05-31 17:13:54,stocks,"I can't agree with that considering inflation just eats up your money over time. While slow over a 30 year period that's a ton lost in value. There is no ""no risk"", but I would say just holding cash is not the least risk."
2021-05-31 10:45:05,stocks,"Very convincing and well written, thank you a lot. I will look into this more and most likely adjust the ratio I had planned. 

If you had to invest into a global ETF, is there a specific one you have in mind?"
2021-05-31 11:00:25,stocks,"The companies headquartered in Ireland and Bermuda are only doing so for tax reasons.  They are US companies, they wouldn't really be considered Irish companies just because they are taking advantage of the Irish tax system, when almost everything else that they do is based in the US."
2021-05-31 17:21:30,stocks,"I get that. That's why stock isn't the only instrument. 

In a down market the government will lower interest to boost spending, yield will drop and if you have bonds, you sell to raise cash. 

2020 proves this. The government can print as much cash as they want while keeping interest low.

Unless you want to simulate a scenario with run-off inflations (down market + high interest due to inflation) then yes, shit's all fucked. You get Venezula and hope to god you moved cash to some other country. <- this is when you buy bankruptcy insurance."
2021-05-31 10:50:24,stocks,Gun to my head I'd go with VT but I feel *very* strongly against all-world or ex-US.
2021-05-31 11:09:06,stocks,Companies with international presence or foreign headquarters are going to be tied at least somewhat to the local economies. It's the increasingly global economy I mentioned before.
2021-05-31 17:54:56,stocks,"Yea I know what you mean, but I am not looking trying to make trades and optimize my return - of course that's a good strategy, but I want to avoid trying to do something stupid I don't fully understand or might fail at and end a very simple plan - or at least hurt it. Of course that would be great, but reality is I will be working for another 40 years. If I pay in my current balance and 1k a month over 40 years at a 5% return a year, then I'd end up with 2 1/2 million. My plan is only to have enough money in there to live comfortably, maybe quite 10 years earlier. I am not planning to have children, so that's no concern. At that point, at least from my current view, optimizing the strategy doesn't really matter. Even at 2% a year that would be a million after 40 years and is equivalent to the average lifetime earning in my country."
2021-05-31 10:51:27,stocks,Thank you 😊
2021-05-31 11:11:46,stocks,"I agree that it's still a global economy, just didn't want someone to think that a bunch of Irish founded companies were making up part of the S&P 500 or something.  I'm interested in what will happen if a global minimum tax increase is actually passed, which would make it so companies would not have any real incentive to just move their headquarters to another country."
2021-05-31 11:40:34,stocks,"Ah, sure, totally fair."

2021-05-31 00:00:00,stocks,"Future Salesforce Acquisitions So Salesforce is one of my favorite investments and I was reading the most recent earnings report tonight. I noticed one section stand out:

> ""It's made our company, Salesforce and Slack, well, more important to customers than ever. So bringing them together is exciting. And once the merger is approved, we're going to build Slack and all of our products, they'll all become Slack first. It's going to make our customers more productive.""

The idea here is that Salesforce is going to go all-in on Slack and the product really is incredible with respects to integrating across the entire tech world. To me it seems like they're Slack is going to be a huge step forward into Microsoft's space and I'm excited to see the competition intensify.


That being said, Salesforce is a less complete solution than what Microsoft has to offer in terms of collaboration tools, and products like Atlassian are too expensive. I've noticed that Microsoft and Atlassian both have product management tools and developer repository tools like GitHub and Bitbucket.

I'm concluding that there is a strong possibility that Slack may acquire companies like Monday.com, who have files for IPO this may, and possibly a company like Digital Ocean.


Thoughts?"
2021-05-31 12:50:01,stocks,There were rumors a few years ago that Salesforce was going to buy APPN (Appian). Still could make sense at a cheaper price.
2021-05-31 07:06:32,stocks,Slack is basically discord no?
2021-05-31 10:01:22,stocks,Its a more disjointed discord. I've found businesses are more likely to use slack than discord but the user experience if you need to be in more than 1 workspace (server) is far inferior on slack to pretty much anything else

So i think you can find it cheaper later. It's going to be another earnings report or two before they're profitable and once people see the PE ratio they'll freak out at first. Board is having all kinds of drama, and the 737 investigations never stop. 

You need to be in it for the long haul and imo you should be patient on establishing your position.  You have 2 to 5 months to get established, and that's if investors dont freak out after the first positive earnings report shows their PE ratio at a huge number. If they do you've got a little longer.  They do have a starliner test coming up in August supposedly. But that's just as likely to get cancelled as go through to be a catalyst."

Couldn’t people have looked at “fair value” reports back in 1999 and the years leading up to the tech bubble, and possibly avoided a bubble?

like what we have today, CFRA reports, Morningstar reports about “fair value”, didn’t people have this information back in the 1990’s? Or just used technical analysis?


This also is relevant today, I hear people talking about how the market is massively overvalued right now, but is it really? 
I own MSFT among other stocks, MSFT is fairly valued according to its CFRA reports. I have a hard time comprehending that the market is overvalued.

there were a lot of ""cool kids"" that had ""amazing tech"", but couldn´t tell you how they would make money with their tech to save their lifes. 

its the main reason today that VC and investment into startups has dramtically changed. the tech itself is rarely revolutionary. but you have to present a strong business case. 

back in the days the main goal was ""to get big"" and yet nobody knw how to really achive that. 

the amount of cash that got burned at marketing events, fairs, press releases etc was insane. yet there was no real revenue. 

I got a nice anecdote from the 90´s. 

a former boss of mine had a company that basically offered a platform for artist to upload and market their songs. a very early version of something like spotify if you will.   
yet , only a fraction of the population had internet access that was able to deliver the necessary bandwith.   
audio tools and equipment to convert music into MP3´s was in its infancy. codec technology wasn´t as refined. 

 and on top of that: a new fledging artist that doesn´t have all this surely cannot afford to pay for a service like this. 

the idea was amazing. yet the time was just not right."

2021-05-31 10:50:23,stocks,"The .com bubble popping is a little harder to explain but most of it comes down to tech illiteracy (which even people who say they're tech literature still don't understand this shit).

There was barely any e-commerce at the time of the dot com bubble.  The secure method of doing transactions online with a credit card wasn't invented until the mid 00s.

Most of the internet was powered by advertisements from real world businesses.  In traditional advertising you are given an idea of exposure and so you have a billboard and perhaps 10,000 people will see it a day.... you'll be able to figure out that it costs $0.50 per person to see that billboard.  TV is even more efficient, you might be paying $0.10 per person viewing.

Online advertisements promised that you would pay one tenth of a penny per person viewing your advertisement (and it was all banner advertisements and pop ups, no videos in pre-broadband days).  The demand was so high for online advertising that advertisers were paying extreme rates to attract pages to advertise on.

Today Google gives an average of $0.30 CPM (Clicks Per Thousand) and people are pretty happy to live off of that.  But at the time you could get anywhere from $8 to $40 CPM.  Just a small website with less than 1,000 regular viewers could make anywhere from $1000-$40,000/month (had a website, made $19,000/month off of it).

CPM was a metric in which people would get paid for every single person viewing the page and more for people who click on it.  The average offered was based on your clickthrough percentages.  How did I make my money?  I had a click bot clicking on the banners, closing them, refreshing the page and then clicking again.

Since there was no e-commerce all advertising dollars were coming from real world businesses who didn't understand that their business was not getting advertised to people in their area, to individual users, or on effective websites.  Once a NYT article on the advertising bubble came out it sort of ruined it for everyone involved in this kind of operation.  A lot of these advertising platforms went belly up which meant that the revenue source for a lot of these websites also went belly up.

Google spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing advertising technology that could restore consumer confidence in online advertising.

I think there's a bit of a tech bubble right now.  But I think the information is different.  An investor in Geocities had no way of knowing that the entire revenue source for the company would be gone in a matter of seven days after the publication of a single article convincing real world companies they're being swindled."

- Sir John Templeton shorted the bubble. he knew lots of the companies were overvalued and not well-managed, so he shorted based on the IPO lockup. He predicted most of the insiders at the iffy companies would sell like crazy the minute they could sell. And he was correct. 

- Dodge & Cox, a value-leaning brokerage, didn't buy any of the trendy dot-com stocks. They underperformed during the bubble but out-performed the market for several years afterwards. Which is typical for the company, they don't chase trends or buy anything that's overvalued and it pays off in the long-run. 

- Michael Burry gained attention by shorting the dot com bubble. it's not touched on in the movie version of the Big Short but it is explained in the book. 

- Jeremy Grantham at GMO did not buy any of the dot-com companies, he also got out of the Japan bubble in the mid-1980s before that bubble popped.

- Buffet & Munger at Berkshire Hathaway didn't buy any of the dot com companies. of course. Buffett didn't buy Apple until it was undervalued circa 2012."

2021-05-31 07:03:46,stocks,"Don’t judge whether we’re in a bubble today based on Microsoft. It’s the flurry of IPOs and SPACs that is an obvious bubble signal. When every new public company gets a valuation in the range of double digit billions, something’s wrong. For a recent example, look at Oatly’s market cap: $14 billion. That’s nearly half of Hershey’s market cap, despite Oatly being unprofitable and Hershey making profits in the range of $1.4 billion. 

Back in the Dot Com bubble, it was obvious to people like professor Jeremy Siegel and Warren Buffett. Here’s a couple of quotes from the old days: 

“Value comes from the ability to sell above cost, not from sales. If sales alone created value, General Motors would be the world's most valuable corporation. In a competitive economy, no profitable firm will go unchallenged. Margins must erode as others chase the profits that seem so easy to come by now. There is a limit to the value of any asset, however promising. Despite our buoyant view of the future, this is no time for investors to discard the lessons of the past.”

- Jeremy Siegel, *Big-Cap Tech Stocks Are a Sucker Bet*, 2000

“Berkshire will someday have opportunities to deploy major amounts of cash in equity markets — we are confident of that. But, as the song goes, “Who knows where or when?” Meanwhile, if anyone starts explaining to you what is going on in the truly-manic portions of this “enchanted” market, you might remember still another line of song: “Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.”

- Warren Buffett, 1999"

2021-05-31 10:38:42,stocks,"Let me offer my views on your questions:

To some people, it was quite obvious that some valuations in 1999 just did not make sense. I recall that, at some point, Priceline.com was valued more than the value of several airlines combined. It could not have really been prevented. The market was fully irrational. Lots of investors were talking about the “new economy”, where revenues and earnings did not matter. A new valuation measure was being promoted by some: cash burn rate, i.e. how much and how fast companies were spending... There was also FOMO and a lot of day trading. When taxi drivers and hairdressers were making crazy returns, it was clear that something was completely wrong.

Some of those overvalued businesses were actually ahead of their time, others were just jumping on the internet craze bandwagon.

Someone wrote here that the P/E ratio of the Nasdaq composite at time was near 500. I do not recall the value, but I believe it was in mid 40s. Anyway, it was quite meaningless since most overvalued stocks at the time had little earnings. Today, they do have some earnings, but they are overvalued. The signs of the 2000 are visible today. Same irrationality, same FOMO, taxi drivers and hairdressers making huge returns, etc. The only thing that is different today is the prolonged artificial low interest rates and the massive government pumping of cash."
2021-05-31 11:47:53,stocks,"I was young then, so of course I don't recall the vibe at the time. That said, this what I've pieced together from looking at the data, reading a few articles with retrospectives or that analyze hype cycles, and talking to my parents:

1. It is very hard to assess the fair value of companies in new industries that aren't making money. The analyst needs to estimate the probability the business model can work, the probability the company will be among the winners if it does work, and the profitability if the company wins.
2. ""The probability the company will be among the winners"" is where analysis tends to start completely falling apart at the macro level. During the beginning of a technology hype cycle, there are a LOT of companies doing nearly the same thing, and the vast majority of them are going to zero or close to it. But if you're investing in one of them, you obviously believe that one has a higher chance of success than the rest. So even though basically everyone knew there was a bubble, they all still ended up overinvested in whichever companies they liked, pushing up valuations up everywhere.
3. Valuations seem to drift up overtime. I don't think anyone is actually sure why, probably some combination of wealth inequality, central bank meddling, and government debt, if I had to guess. So it's really hard to tell if the ""market"" is overvalued.
4. Market timing is extraordinarily difficult.

As a side note - the real estate bubble between 2005 and 2007 was also obvious to experienced people in the industry. The severity of the consequences when it broke and the timing of the crash are the things that only the lucky and truly brilliant were able to figure out."
2021-05-31 05:33:23,stocks,"Tech back then was in its infancy and the impact it would eventually have was impossible to guesstimate. People FOMOed hard and companies promised things that they could not deliver. That realization eventually led to a crash, many speculative companies ceased to exist and it had zero impact on your every day life.  
  
Twenty years later, we now clearly see how tech permeates every sector you can imagine, as well as your private life. We couldn't get rid of it if we wanted. The way these companies operate is very well established and accepted. We are just coming out of a global pandemic and without tech, it would have impacted the developed world much more.  
  
The market may be overvalued right now, but it's not a bubble market -- at least not one we can see and anticipate. The only market I see as speculative is *otpyrc* (read backwards, as per sub rules). It has all the signs. Alt*k*oins popping up left and right every week. Ridiculous valuations that cannot be explained by fundamentals. People who don't understand it investing. Developers promising features."
2021-05-31 07:45:53,stocks,"1999 was less of a “tech” bubble and more of a .com bubble, so you really can’t compare MSFT to what happened.  Everyone was investing in unprofitable .com businesses that had never made a dime (FOMO anyone?) These are companies that really did not have an actual product, but only provided a service, unlike MSFT who had an actual physical product.  As long as banks kept lending to the .com businesses, they were able to operate, but were constantly hemorrhaging money.  The banks stopped lending, which started many businesses to go under.  

The value of those companies meant nothing at the time.  Yes, even back then the market was a casino."

No one cared what the fair value of tech companies was in the 90s because they were speculating that their future value would be much higher. Also, the investments that happened in that bubble helped grow the internet into what it is today. If lots of people hadn’t poored lots of money into it then it wouldn’t have grown the way it has. Some of the bagholders might have lost money, but they also helped invest in the future in some ways."

2021-05-31 11:06:52,stocks,"You should seek the book *dot con*. 

I see lots of great stuff here, but I want to contribute a macro narrative that helped fuel the fire...the internet was revolutionary, no? It was, but it was also early, primitive even, at this moment in history. As the market became frothier and frothier, many analysts forewent traditional evaluation models, because so many companies had negligible values according to these dinosaur methodologies, and this flew in the face of ever-climbing tech stock prices. Retail investors weren’t the only ones to FOMO either; fund managers and analysts had seemingly been forced to come to terms with the dominance and inexorable climb of the nasdaq. So many were wrong for so for long (from Netscape in 95 up til 97/98) that, to preserve their jobs and clients, they needed to quickly adopt the unlimited-internet paradigm. Fund managers who were prudent and conservative regarding tech stocks were laughed out of Wall Street after submitting substandard returns when compared to the nasdaq. Many adapted, so as not to die. 

The next item might be extrapolation, or over exaggeration. Amazon was a solid business, if not for the money it was doomed to lose until it became dominant. However and profoundly, many investors took this further, extrapolating this new paradigm to places it did not belong, like toys and delivery. There were a flurry of delivery services at this time, just like door dash or postmates; it was just that they all lost money, though.

The internet was more akin to another niche or platform of business than a true, wholesale revolution. Most investors then likely would have believed that, by this point in time, some egregious number of businesses would be internet-only, and strip malls and big-box stores would have become superannuated and vanished. It was to have been the inverse of the famous Etrade commercial featuring the ghost town-like stretch of empty stores; physical retail, they thought, was set to die. 

The internet did bring about changes, but, as with all industries new or old, only a handful of concentrated companies stood to benefit. Fundamentals mattered, it turned out..."
2021-05-31 11:27:57,stocks,"Yes, in 1999, people said that the market was overvalued. They also said the high stock prices were justified by future profits (the same thing that people are saying today).

https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/"
2021-05-31 13:38:49,stocks,"Anecdotal here since I was a newer investor at that time.

I do remember a lot of talk about the market being incredibly overvalued, but the general feeling was one of exuberance, not fear.  ""It's different this time.""  ""These companies/industries are the future.""  ""Fundamentals do not tell the story with these kinds of growth companies.""  ""It's easy money--invest and don't miss out.""  ""Buy several/all of them so you'll get the winners.""  ""Bears have called 15 of the last 3 crashes.""  Sound familiar?  Yeah--that was the kind of talk back then, and the bears were labelled as old fogies and doomsayers and generally ignored.

A lot of institutional investors got at least partly out, and the exuberant retail investors got left holding the bag.  In hindsight it was incredibly obvious.  We'll probably see the same thing said about the markets of today.  Today's markets are not as badly overvalued, but they are still quite expensive, have had a rapid run-up since March 2020, and the high valuations I think is wider (basically wider but more shallow as opposed to narrower and deeper like 1999).  If we get an interest rate rise I think we could see a decent-sized correction/crash, but such things can be hard to predict since you never know how much a future event is already priced-in."

2021-05-31 11:27:55,stocks,"One interesting thing is SP500's PE ratio at its 2000 peak was actually lower than 1999's low 30s at around 26-28, forward PE before the crash is probably even better at just low 20s. So from sp500 alone it's very hard to tell a crash is coming. Signs were pointing to the economy fundamentals could support the overall market rise. While the internet stocks are clearly in bubble but the spy drop is pretty hard to predict. The 2008 one was also hard as spy's pe ratio barely pass 20. Housing bubble might be a bit obvious back then but there isn't an index that can indicate how bad it was, so again it's very hard to predict. Right now though more and more value investors think the bubble is in the most common etfs as they are perked up by universal stimulus and people just routinely putting money in them without caring about their fundamentals."

2021-05-31 12:48:09,stocks,"A lot of the bigger tech names aren’t showing the same signs of being over valued, and I think people just saying tech leads to confusing some of that. 

This isn’t picking on their cases or anything, there’s just a difference between a lot of these tech stocks. Ones trading what are considered classically overvalued at like 20pe or whatever that line is, but than you see Tesla, or I’m several other companies trading with 3-4 digit multiples, or being valued at several billion without even making a profit. Like Amazon may have a higher pe for some but they’re undoubtedly going to exist tomorrow. The over valued aspect reflects that, and will always exist to some extent as long as companies are trading so far a head. 

In that sense it’s like the dot com era. A bunch of companies not making shit being traded like they’ll take the world."

2021-05-31 18:05:26,stocks,"The short answer is yes.  We can see the value in tech.  We know it's overvalued.  But... and this is the crux of the situation in 1999 too - how long can we make money on it before it bursts?  And, more importantly, how much can we make?  Is there another 2% this week?  10% in the next few months?  How about if I short it - nope - losing money there.  Maybe I can eek out 2-3% on an option here, or land a 30% profit selling a call for January next year.  Who knows?  I don't.  They didn't know that answer in 1999 either.  All anyone knew was dotcommers were walking away millionaires with unicorn companies that had no profit and were buying out or being bought out by anyone and everyone.  It was complete and utter mania, but everyone knew zero value companies were being bought and sold like ice cream on a warm summer night to my teenage.r

We don't have that level of mania today, but it's price-inflated.  The reason, though, is Fed is inflating the economy and stock markets rise with the tide.  Even if I say, geez, how can anyone pay a P/E of 51 on Adobe?  Everyone else is sayin, yeah but it's equivelent to the rest of its sector, and they're right.  That's the quip, the brunt, the crux, the narrative.  In reality, there are so many dollars out there, the stock market is being pushed up.  It's a tide, a wave, a tsunami that has yet to peak.  Like all water, watch for flux.  The Fed will drive straight for full employment.  #MMT is upon us and the profit margin is huge.  But keep up your guard.  Watch the Fed. Watch the market.

AND

Good luck trading."
2021-05-31 18:41:59,stocks,"I was alive then, and knew it, and predicted it within my group. Having learned about the crash of 1929, and how the market was in a massive bubble before the crash - I said, ""This is the same thing, it gets too high and it's all gonna come down."" And it did, within 2 years.


The difference between now and 1929 is that the market will automatically stop trading on a big enough overall drop, mitigating damage (and they also added margin calls to prevent the losses they saw back then). Within the next few years, the market will correct - hopefully it happens slowly, but probably not. Everyone is going to milk it to get theirs, which is what drives the overinflated prices in the first place - and they're all going to bail at the same time too, which is what causes the crash."

2021-05-31 10:07:57,stocks,"The Y2K run-up was due to a multitude of reasons.   Way more than I can probably list.  However 2 significant factors were the fear of the Y2K bug and the onset of consumerization of the Internet.

The Y2K bug remediation effort led to a massive spending spree on everything technology so that businesses could avoid their systems crashing when the calendar turned over from 1999 to 2000.   I was a consulting engineer at the time with a regional systems reseller.   We couldn't sell and install systems fast enough.   Things cooled off quickly once the clock ticked over to 12:01am in January 2000 and the world didn't end.

The consumerization of the Internet led to things like [etoys.com](https://etoys.com) and the rise of amazon as a book seller.   Any company with a .com domain could ask-for and receive loads of cash.   IPOs were printing money.   I know a guy who worked for a Linux startup (not RedHat).   His net worth, at one point, was $14M but only in restricted stocks.   Once his options vested, I believe the value was something like $14K.   When tech sales started cooling off, folks started looking for realistic valuations and stock prices plummeted."

Companies and investors made up ever-increasing amazing stories to justify the valuations - for example, we can transmit a full-length movie to a theater in 2 minutes (instead of distributing physical film), etc.  There was a sense that optical networking and the internet were going to change everything, so no historical analysis mattered. Until the AB analyst added up the CapX forecasts of the Telecoms in 2001 and realized that everyone was double ordering gear and demand was about to crater.  Game over."

Fair value is a myth.

If you assume that fair value is the price that dealers would quote if their inventories were exactly zero, as if these dealers are not exposed to any price risk. MMs pushes the price away from this fundamental value, this depends on the size of the outside spread and the dealer’s maximum long and short position limits. Fisher estimated that this price was usually within a factor of two of true value (""fair value"").

Money flooded into the sector and no one wanted to miss out. It's like GME and AMC in a sense that people aren't really looking at their financials or long-term sustainability as much as it's 'easy' money. Now imagine that type of scenario playing out with a ton of different tech stocks. You had some organic growth tech stocks such as Cisco, Intel, and Microsoft having sustainable growth but then you had tech startups with no actual product going public with very little to show. Investors ignored the fundamentals and didn't want to miss out on the gains. There were a ton of people who knew about the tech bubble and the housing bubble as well. Not many who could have done more did anything about it because the bubble gets too big and the money was too good to pass up."
2021-05-31 15:12:19,stocks,"Depends on what tech. Tech that had no tangible assets to back it up (i.e. tech that can be overtaken by a competitor or renedered obsolete in an instant) : Yes. That type of tech was pretty obviously overvalued. The type of tech that had tangible assets (e.g. Apple, Amazon) was not and came out ahead (and Google because the were the best at  providing a dotcom service people really needed instead of a service people merely wanted).

Taking a similar view what type of tech will go bust in the near future bubble because they cannot fall back on fundamentals? Coins. Maybe the biggest one will survive. But with China already having basically outlawed bitcoin (and most autocratic regimes - i.e the vast majority of the world - sure to follow that lead) even that isn't certain. Tech companies with tangible assets and a product that people really need will survive (e.g. Tesla, Semiconductor businesses, and basically any tech that is relevant to fighting climate change - like companies in the battery storage  business)"

If I’m buying stock in a company I’m basically a part owner.  If I was buying a business I wouldn’t buy one that was losing money.  Some of us saw those folks buying into the bubble as the fools they were. 

I had a few colleagues leave to join startups.  They all wound up unemployed 6 months or a year later when the bubble popped. I declined and stayed employed. 

If you understood business and profit and loss statements and dug a little it was well known many companies had no plan to profitability. Eventually the bigger fools stopped coming in and it was a rush for the doors before investments were worthless."

High ratios are ok if we believe companies can grow into them within a reasonable time frame, and for new companies in new industries, that’s an incredibly hard question to answer. Back around 1999, “yes” answers were being given for too many companies that didn’t warrant such optimism. Some were good companies that couldn’t really grow THAT fast. But man y were for bad companies with stupid business models (i.e., CLECs), others were for good businesses not being managed in sensible ways (buy customers at all costs), and others were for business models that wouldn’t be as sustainable as many supposed (i.e. AOL). Rather than see it as a pure valuation failure, I’d say it was a valuation failure caused by failures in company analysis."

And just because we went from x - 5 to x - 3 in a short time doesn't mean we can go from x - 3 to x - 1 in the same time let alone reach x in the near future.

2021-05-31 07:53:47,stocks,"What happened back then with the start of the internet feels a lot like what’s happening today with EVs. We knew it was going to change the world, we just didn’t know how, which led to all sorts of speculative nonsense.

EVs are basically going through their own dot-com crash right now. Many were riding purely on hype and are now 50% or more off their peaks. Several companies like RIDE, WKHS, FSR, and NKLA have been exposed as unprofitable at best and outright frauds at worst. Tesla itself has “only” lost 30% which makes it practically a winner.

Meanwhile established car companies like Ford are quickly entering the field and committing to becoming fully electric in a few years. We still don’t know how well they can shift their production, but they probably have a better shot at making it compared to the “next Teslas.”"
2021-05-31 09:37:43,stocks,"This⬆️. A lot of the madness centered around e-commerce. I remember one day in the late 90s that some analyst or CNBC broadcaster made the connection that fedex and ups were going to have to deliver all these new products being sold direct to consumers online. Everyone immediately began looking at these boring delivery services as B2C plays instead of just logistics plays. The change in perspective caused a quick, positive shift in sentiment and the prices accelerated rapidly as a result. 

I also remember walking into my brother’s company in Silicon Valley one day in the early 2000s as the bubble was starting to burst. I met a guy who lost something like $20MM in paper wealth that day because the company he helped found was supposed to be acquired but the acquiring company had something fall through that killed the deal. Everywhere I went in the valley it was excess and business models thought up by children with no business acumen who could put together a deck of slides and guesstimate some financials (leave lots of padding for salaries, ping pong tables, snacks, and expensive hoodies). 

I was in my early 20s at that point too but worked in education. But in tech, money was getting thrown at anyone who could ask put together a business plan and connect it to B2B or B2C sales. It was all fascinating but it felt pretty clear to me (I think anyway; hindsight is always clearer.) that it wasn’t sustainable. People had started using the term New Economy to describe the unchecked, low-inflation, economic growth we were experiencing. Prior to that point, other historical periods of economic growth were followed by inflation and then interest rate increases and economic slow-down or decline. People (including some smart economists) started to think that we could have an extended, possibly permanent, period of growth without the requisite inflation, increases to interest,  and subsequent slowed growth or decline. It was wild. 

I will say this, a couple years ago it felt to me like venture capital firms were starting to throw money at any startup founder that had half an idea. At that point it felt a lot like the first internet boom. That kind of activity has slowed. Investors seem to be much more detailed in their due diligence and they are more careful to wait until a startup has a product in market or cash flowing before investing significantly. It seems that the days of investing in gregarious entrepreneurs with good but unproven ideas are gone. That’s the insanity that worried me although an argument could be made that stricter investing criteria could be stifling innovation at the riskier or longer term ends of the investment spectra."

The focus seems to be creating a niche large enough to run a business in. I find a lot of current businesses don't follow a traditional model of selling services for the cost of providing them, + overhead to run the business. The two leading corporate cultures seem to be either undercut the competitor even if they cannot afford to, or offer something for free and rely on advertisements which won't be as lucrative without the data harvesting."

fair value is also subjective. Its based on fundamentals that imo might as well be arbitrary measures of performance.

1) price is dependent on supply/demand of shares

2) whether people buy or sell is by popular vote.

for example, you can have two companies, one with zero revenue (plenty examples of this) and one with amazing revenue, where the zero revenue company stock will outperform..

if you got revenue, you can optimize. but loads of companies do not have any sales at all. 

look at EV companies and their evaluation as an example. surely a company that takes part in a global marketplace should be able to sell a decent amount of vehicles to justify any significant evaluation right ?   


well, think again. where´s the revenue ? there is none to speak of.   
and a Unicorn is called so because it is rare. growth potential, revenue stream and decent profit margin, plus a USP that separates the company from the rest of the competitiors. it does not have to be a real technical moat or anything. but something that makes it special.

This is not the best lesson for younger investors.  Unless you're nostradamus and can predict the market, you should anticipate that your portfolio will take massive hits along the way and welcome it.  You might get lucky once and pull your money out at the peak of the market, but the next time you try it, you'll crash and burn, rendering your success the first time around more worthless than if you had simply held.  

Suggestion: Hold ETFs and single stocks that you fully understand and believe in for the long-term that you do not ever sell until you need to re-consolidate into things with high yields and lower volatility for passive income.  If you want, play around with single stocks with money you can afford to lose on shorter term holds.  Clearly define how long you intend to hold, whether that is a few months, 1 year, 5 years, or decades.  Know whether you are buying an undervalued stock that you intend to sell when it reaches it's actual valuation, or whether you believe the stock will grow over time."

The other thing that is happening and will continue to happen is the big guys taking more and more from the other tech players.

It just takes time.  So one trend for example that I do not see changing is the big four more and more creating their own silicon instead of buying from others.  Apple is already there.     Google and Amazon will be next and both are working towards those goals.     Microsoft is also working in this direction but just a little slower."

If it does work like that, we are VERY far away from reaching that point, like 100+ years away at least. What we have isn't even in the same universe as let's say a squirrel brain let alone a human brain. We have recently discovered a body of methods that use linear algebra and iteration to make fuzzy algorithms that sometimes work well. Cutting edge AI aren't really all that complex and are very limited in scope. It's not known how much life left this body of methods has as far as real progress; There is for sure a lot of polishing and applying (hopefully for substantial economic value) that can be done, but I'm not so sure it's the body of methods that will carry us all that far. I think pop culture and misunderstandings of what ""machine learning"" is have led a lot of people to massively over expect on what the ceiling of this generation of AI is. It could be a ceiling twice as high as where we currently are, or we could already be pretty close to reaching it; I would say there is an extremely low likelihood of getting anywhere close to mammal intelligence in the best cases, and for that type of explosion I would expect at least 100 years and a situation where near-human level systems have already existed for some time.

2021-05-31 11:25:31,stocks,"Totally agreed. That’s the point I was hoping to convey. The investments they make are so small that for startups with higher upfront R&D costs and/or time to achieve commercial success, an entrepreneur either has to have their own money or a family who can help them bootstrap. Simply having a great idea and a strong business plan aren’t enough in the absence of larger, risk tolerant capital investments. I still think there is enough capital for most business ideas,  but there are some sectors in desperate need of innovation for which it would take too long and be too costly to bring a prototype to market for even with a bunch of angels all in at their max check levels. There isn’t really an investor profile who would be a good fit for say mid-market public sector ERP systems. That could be a $20+ billion addressable market but it’s not sexy, requires a very specific team and skill set to build, and has a long, expensive ramp time. Finding a single investor willing to spend that kind of time and money without a deep understanding of the market opportunity and the risk/reward potential would be tough. 

To build a prototype and find a pilot customer willing to take the plunge would probably cost between 1 and $2.0MM and take 2+ years to get out the door. So either you’re looking at finding a super risk tolerant group of early stage investors or or an untenable number of angels. On the demand side, it’s a market whose current installs are ancient, the only competitors are selling software that was written 20 years ago, and it’s an oligopoly so contract values and profitability are high with a nice size total addressable market. But in today’s investment climate, I don’t see a path to innovation and entrepreneurship. I think there are at least a handful of those kinds of opportunities that are being woefully neglected."

the bigger picture reasons – rampant, highly competitive european imperialism; the rise of germany as a world power, upsetting the existing balance; reckless foreign policy, especially on the part of wilhelm ii – made WW1 more or less inevitable, at least in the estimation of statesmen of the time

after Napoleon, european diplomacy was *relatively* stable, but growing tensions escalated to a full-on cold war in the 1890s, which led to a full-on hot war in the 1910s. when franz ferdinand got shot, it provoked a very quick escalation to european war, but any number of events before or after 1914 could have done so. if not in the balkans, they would have come to a head in north africa or elsewhere"

2021-05-31 15:04:10,stocks,"That may have a significantly higher probability of coming true than you may think.  

Tesla is a decade ahead of all competitors in the development of self-driving AI.  This is not an insignificant lead.  It may be the case that in as little as ten years ride share companies such as Uber and Lyft will have bought massive numbers of Tesla automobiles and set up huge charging and holding stations near population centers.  This would allow people to be able to summon a self-driving car with their smart phone within a few minutes for very little.  If this were to come to pass I would expect individual car ownership to approach zero.

I think that the broad picture of that out come is not only highly likely, but inevitable.  The major players may be different but Tesla is perfectly positioned to take advantage of that future eventuality.  And at the current moment there is no viable competitor to Tesla.  

Depending upon how rapidly this change takes place, it very well could be that Tesla captures 90% or more of the global auto market share."

then see how much capital you would need to generate this income by avg % returns (like in an etf) or dividends.  
this approach has the goal of preserving capital for as long as possible and maybe even after you are gone. 

  
OR you do the same calculation and then just try to guess your avg life expectancy . then see how much capital you need to take your estimated amount of money out until you croak.

The US tax system, despite what you hear on reddit, is one of the most progressive ones on the planet. This is not due to the very high taxes on the rich, but rather the extremely low taxes on the poor, and the relatively tiny portion of all taxes paid by the middle class.

In order to get that effective tax rate via income taxes, you'd need to have income of around $200K+ as a household. That's 3X the median income, so hardly middle earners.

I live off my dividends from 30% of my capital. I find it easier to swing trade out of high yielding stocks since you’re always guaranteed the dividend amount. Stick to profitable companies and etfs that pay quarterly and have paid consistent dividends over the years. And don’t sell until the price is higher than what you bought it at. You may only need to hold for a few days or a few months. It’s all about patience. Swing trading is much easier and safer than day trading in my opinion.

I'm trying prevent the unlimited loss a short position can entail without losing my shorts (as shorts aren't always available to purchase when I want them either and think closing at current prices would be a very bad idea!)

I'm not familiar with doing options or puts and don't think I qualify either to place those orders...  as far as those possibilities gos.

So here's what I was thinking, and your thoughts or comments would be appreciated..  what about if for now until it was more obvious massive volatility wasn't still in place... if I placed a market order for the same shorted stock then doing a stop quote to sell if goes down. I don't want to risk a lot though so I don't want my stop quote to be much lower then what I purchase it at... and if the stock decided to start tanking the same time I place the market order, it could have already dipped more then 5% in the minute or two it takes me to place the stop quote order to sell immediately after purchasing. (I wish it were possible to place both within the same order!) Is it possible to set a limit order to buy or place just above the market price, to try to get in an upward trend, or after a resistance level has been broken? 

I really appreciate it guys. I'm really hurting this past week learning as I go and made a noob move costing me the entire $20k I made investing for 2021.

Buying an out of the money call can hedge your short. Aside from that, if you want to cap your potential losses, enter a stop at whatever price your max loss is. To enter an order above market it has to be a stop order. The stop price is what triggers your order, whether it’s limit or market. Not sure what’s going on here but it sounds messy. You should probably stick to long only until you know your way around."
2021-05-31 01:25:01,stocks,Confused by this.  Not sure how going long and short on the same stock works.  Wouldn't they just cancel each other out and you end up paying the borrow rate?  That's if you are long and short the same amount of shares.  Try using options as a hedge for the leverage.

Did you ""short"" a stonk (ie. did you sell it without owning it, like hedge funds do?) . Assuming this is what you did -- 

What you are asking us is how to hedge your bets, which is also reducing profits. But, you didn't want to hedge your bet, you wanted max profits, right? 

If you aren't familiar with options, you really should not be selling shorts, as you can lose a lot of money. 

So you shorted GME or AMC and it went up? 

You didn't put in a stop loss to start with?

You don't know how to enter a limit order? 

You didn't buy an option to hedge your bet and limit your losses? 

You didn't try out how these things work with fake money aka ""paper trading"" first? 

Easy solution. Just go to your brokers home page and login. Go to your account profile, then type in the search ""Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A"", and your money will be back. Easy peasy. 

In reality, you can buy a call option, so if it goes up more, you have the profit of the call option. Or, just ""buy to close"" right now, and take your loss as a lesson. Learn about all of the options (and options) and how to calculate max loss. Max loss on a ""short"" is ""unlimited"".

What I'm thinking is that in the worst case scenario, I can't lose more than 1% (ok, unless there's a market crash, but let's ignore that worst case scenario), but I stand to gain a couple percent from the well-performing stocks. I'd sell everything off at the close of business, to avoid the possibility of after-hours movement erasing the gains from well-performing stocks. And along the way, for all the stocks I lose over the course of the day, I'd reinvest the capital I get back into the well-performing stocks.

2021-05-30 23:22:17,stocks,Try this out on a paper trading account. TDAMERITRADE’s Think Or Swim platform has one. I’m sure there are other brokers that have this feature. After a few weeks see how your paper account is doing and adjust your strategy as needed.

This really only works if “all stocks go up”. If it goes down, or only goes up a few cents you really aren’t making any money."

I think the entire concept of picking stocks based on personal analysis is completely silly in almost all cases. Whatever conclusions you reach while doing your homework are almost definitely completely worthless. The idea that anyone, especially an amateur, can reliably beat the market with a buy and hold strategy without special circumstances (like insider information) is patently ridiculous to me.

I also don’t understand how the number of different stocks you own has anything to do with what portion of your assets you have allocated to them in your mind. You can have 500 different stocks with an equal portion of your money allocated to each that only amounts to 20% of your portfolio total."
2021-05-31 07:19:59,stocks,"Your first paragraph makes it sound like investing is completely like gambling since you say doing your own homework, reading other analysis, going off of what top people say (banks, research companies) are all worthless unless you can definitively know what's going to happen to them.

As for your second paragraph response, diversification and asset allocation definitely matters. Even if you had 50 stocks but 90% of your money is in one, then it's not really diversified. If you had 20/25 and you put more in a few different places that you feel strongly about and less in others that might not have the same growth prospects and it pans out, your overall return goes much higher than it being an equal weight.

My premise for the smaller amount of stock in your portfolio is based on the feeling of ""crap I should have bought more"" when your initial hypothesis pans out.

I know you can arbitrarily write an option which puts you at risk for assignment but does the same hold true if you buy an existing contract and sell that contract. Will you be liable for assignment?

You can:

1. buy to open, sell to close. 
Or
2. Sell to open, buy to close. 

It is the same idea as shares. 

So to answer your question, no you wouldn’t be liable so long as you’re buying and selling the same quantity of contracts, of course."

Your example is too out of ordinary. Lets say you buy a call option at a strike price of 102. While a market price is 100. And you paid $50 premium. If the stock go up a lot lets say $110 (which is 10% higher than market). You can sell the contract (which will be higher than the $50 you paid as premium, as long as you are not getting IV crush).

Same, as if the stock goes down to $95 or stay at $100. You can still sell the contract but you are already losing the premium and selling it will not net you more depending on theta decay, etc..."

2021-05-31 04:07:54,stocks,"Thanks for the answer and my knowledge of options is fairly fragmented. I really only go on Investopedia and look at all the formulas so I can do calculations and stuff.

For the P/L stuff, the math is fairly simple: First you calculate the % movement from strike price to break even by dividing the premium by the strike price. You'd then multiply it by the strike price to get the +/- the stock has to move before breaking even. Afterwards, +/- those values to the strike price to get your lower or upper stock bounds which you then can compare to the current price of the stock.

If you want to see the P/L charts of multiple options, just do a weighted average of the upper or lower bounds of the charts using the number of contracts as the weight.

I did it in java using the JFreeChart library and exp4j (which saves a bunch of time making equations).

I think my next goal is to create a distribution of % movement to break even with strike price as the X axis and +/- % as the Y axis. Maybe even make it into a 3D- graph with the Z axis representing expiration dates although that not might work well for calculating minimums since options have time-value so it'd be a slope with a few bumps that gets steeper and steeper as you approach the current date.

But yeah, I'm fairly solid around the math aspect and managing risk/gain; it's just the stock terms and concepts that I need to learn more of."
2021-05-31 00:00:00,stocks,"Currently reading through the S-1 of Oatly Some of the most interesting notes so far:

1. Oatly is responsible for the majority demand of Oatmilk products everywhere outside of the US.

2. What I was hoping to see: Oatly is looking ahead to diversify into other plant based products like pea protein and potato starches (vegan cheese)

3. Oatlys demand is greater than their supply.



The note on pea protein is particularly interesting since the product is found in many fitness brands and is a core feature to products like Beyond Meat. I've been a vegetarian for 10 years, so I'm familiar with pea proteins utilization across many meat substitute foods and I'm happy to see Oatly consider this space as a form of product diversification."
2021-05-31 01:50:03,stocks,"I really like Oatly and drink it myself even though I'm not even vegan. That said the current valuation is way too high. They have a few very good products but some competitors are starting to come close with their own oat milks. 

I actually bought some shares but I just couldn't justify keeping them with such a high valuation and sold for a small profit.

Definitely waiting for the price to drop to more reasonable levels to buy in again. Maybe I'm wrong and it will never drop. Time will tell."

2021-05-31 03:43:23,stocks,"Atleast where I live in Europe, Oatly is not the most sold product and there is harsh competition from other competitors at cheaper prices.  


I think their valuation is really high but we'll see what their revenues are going to be like. I know when I was in Canada and the US, it was all the rage. I think a lot of that had to do with their partnership with Coffee shops and it being part of the hipster movement.  


Here, it's seen the same way BUT you just have so much competition from companies that are like Walgreens that sell their products at half the cost and have similar and if not better products. I'd look at this one in say a year and see what their revenues are like."
2021-05-31 04:09:51,stocks,"Oatly covers a lot of niches. It's the only oatmilk I can find that is certified GF. Califia farms claims to be GF but will not use 3rd party verification (something celiac people look for). That's a niche of about 3 million people in the US. This also goes for their ice cream and yogurt. Personally, I have a really hard time finding alt-dairy I can eat that doesn't make me violently sick and Oatly is great all around. 

It's not organic, but it's glyphosate free which is one of the main concerns of non-organic grains. More sustainable than pretty much every alt-milk aside from hemp milk which isn't great.

The financial backing of the chinese state, Starbucks stockpiling the barista blend, sold on 3 continents. Best positioned company to take advantage of the hastening shift from cow to more sustainable sources. So yeah I bought a bunch of the stock."

In the U.S. alone, there aren't enough people at the this current point in time for them to even convert to oat milk and become cash flow breakeven.

I'm all for alt milk because I drink it myself (almond milk) but the growth multiple it's been given doesn't make sense based on how many people currently drink alt milk, how big that demo plans to be, and how many other companies are in the mix right now vying for the same sales dollars."

Now, don't start copy those trades, well you can :) , but most importantly, follow what that person does, see what metrics is using, try to learn what & how that poster is doing. 

Also, follow the economy/cycles, smart people making comments about economy/cycles to get idea where markets go next. For example, at this point, (in my beginner opinion) next few years good investments could be commodities, energy, food... (uranium, silver, copper...) Look for cases where there is significant supply shortage (uranium for example) - if this kind of things (macro economic) interest you. For me, it is very helpful.

If you throw all your money in at once, you can't buy more if it keeps dropping. Anyhow, carnival is trading for near $30 Now.  So yes, I did buy when I thought we were near the bottom and missed. So it was an example of trying to catch a falling knife. But when it bounced off the bottom, I bought more...and as of today I'm up 171%.  When I bought more carnival, I also bought into Royal Caribbean at that time... It's up 221% since I bought it.

When I looked at Boeing after the two engines came apart in flight...prepandemic it was trading at about $350, and it was trading about $250, I bought a few shares. It dropped, I bought a few shares, it dropped, I bought a few shares. This was all recent, and now it's back up to trading at a little under $250, and I'm up five and a half percent.  So I missed the bottom with my first purchase, but just kept buying whenever I had expendable cash.  I actually kind of wished it stayed down longer, allowing me to buy more when it was down around $222.  I expect it to be trading at $350 in a year or two.

Rolls-Royce ( RYCEY) is sitting at the bottom, at least where there seems to be a lot of resistance, and has been there for a while. They expect to go cash positive second half of this year.  I don't have very much money in it. Whenever there's a few extra dollars sitting in my brokerage account I buy more shares of Rolls-Royce. I expect to see it double over the next 3 years or so as commercial air travel picks up.  They have a bid in for the re-engining of the B-52. That is supposed to be decided second half of this year."

2021-05-31 10:33:08,stocks,"All up...as of today.  Boeing and Rolls-Royce were recent purchases and I expect to hold them long...a couple years. (Up 5.4% on boeing, and 2.8% on RYCEY).

2021-05-31 06:28:47,stocks,RR is the exclusive engine maker for the A330 neo and the A350. RR has been losing ground with regards to 787 orders and unfortunately is not a part of the new 777x. A350 should outsell 777x.
2021-05-31 10:45:38,stocks,"They have a bid in for the re-engining of the B-52 for the United states. That should be 600 plus engines if they win the bid... I think the more lucrative part of these things is the maintenance contracts to go with these orders. Anyhow, that contract is supposed to be decided the second half of this year.

They are designing the largest engine for commercial aircraft.  Not going to be a big seller until we open the world back up..a year or two. 

It's trading flat...about $1.50. Hard resistance about there. Supposed to go cash positive the second half of this year. In my opinion, it's at the bottom for now, and I try to purchase more shares whenever I have expendable cash in my brokerage account."

2021-05-31 00:00:00,stocks,"Thoughts on Pinterest? Pinterest is currently my biggest holding and I have a strong conviction about it. I love that it's a women-driven investment that is growing impressively fast around the world and sits at 500M monthly active users.

The leadership refers to the company as a personal media application and a search engine for ideas. Their two biggest changes has been the introduction of Shops,  which has pressured Instagram to release its own influencer version of shops and the release of Livestreams with tickets/waitrooms.

I really love the direction that this company is going in and it in some ways it kind of reminds me of the intention of YouTube. Mostly women are going on the platform with an intent to plan or search, so the need for influencing is not nearly as high as it is on platforms like Facebook or Bytedance.

In the short term, I'm bullish on Pinterest with respect to travel. I think we will see continued growth because people are planning their trips and it's a lucrative market.

In the long-term I'm bullish on it being one of the more effective forms of social media with respect to e-commerce and advertising effectiveness. A user may go on Instagram and spend more time, resulting in no net gain for an advertiser. A user on Pinterest is almost guarunteed to enter and exit with an attempted plan or shop.


What are your thoughts on Pinterest?"
2021-05-30 20:59:41,stocks,"Only non-toxic social media platform AFAIK. That has value

In a book on winning companies in the long term, there's a metric that PINS has more PhDs working there than any other tech company. Yes, even more than the biggest ones. The idea being that if you put smart people together into a room, and continously attract more of them, you'll get the best ideas. Just think it's interesting, and maybe also reflects on the company's ideals and people who have options not wanting to go into a company that discards ""Don't be evil"" or continues down such a path.

Also, Pinterest is trying to do ‘story’ pins that don’t link to a blog post (in order to compete with IG) but users are pissed because if they see something they like they want to click on it and with story pins you can’t. They need to make up their mind, social media or search engine!!!"

Eventually the price will peak and consolidate downwards until it finds a strong floor. You might THINK it found its floor, but be patient and wait until it is obvious. Even when you think you are patient enough, you probably should have waited even longer.

Keep it simple. Smaller decisions are less pressured and allow you to move at a comfortable pace. No all/nothing or 100% decisions. They make you feel like its pass or fail, right/wrong.

But just months later, swept up in the wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much higher price — and lost £20,000 (or more than $3 million in [2002-2003's] money. For the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words 'South Sea' in his presence.""

Maybe set up a stop-loss and update the stop-loss periodically.  Then you've already made the decision, and it automatically happens. 

Everybody with enough of time in the market will have stories about the time they almost bought something that shot up, or the time they waited one extra day, or the times they sold early, or the times they didn't get out when they should have.  We're worse than poker players with bad beats."

I think it all depends, if you focus on your big picture,  if the stocks moving up,  and you're way in the black on the trade,  can always cash out and rebuy in,  do something you've always wanted -- and this way it's not ""hurting"" you to do. An extra vacation,  second honeymoon,  major house repair etc.  The position heads south, you still got your side project out of it."

2021-05-31 02:43:43,stocks,There is always the option of selling in batches. Let’s say the stock has shot up and you are in the green. Sell half or a third to lock in gains. It goes up sell more and feel smart it goes down hold or sell but do so knowing you timed the top with half your shares. Sort of a win win.

- take emotion out.
- when in doubt, zoom out.
- you need to remember, you took PROFITS.
- as humans we make the best decision we can, at the time, with the info we have.
- you can't predict the future.
- you could have easily NOT took PROFIT, and be down below where you were at. and today you'd be asking this exact same question except a couple words would be different. like loss, negative, moving down.

you did well :)"
2021-05-31 06:17:27,stocks,"The best decision some time leads to a bad result. Just as much as a bad decision some time leads to a great result. 

What you should focus on is to make as many good decisions as possible over a long period of time. When you do this you get a great aggregate result. 

Example: It’s the best decision not to yolo your life savings in some meme even though your friends are making hundreds of thousands over a week. 
It’s the best decision not because of the “missed” income but instead because of risk, philosophy and wealth preservation etc."

Now if it increases, slowly sell off the remaining shares. Yes you're limiting reward, but you're also limiting risk now just in case it does swing the other way. If the value decreases, now is the opportunity to buy back in at a lower price, and you just repeat the process.

It's a simple concept, but it helped massively with my FOMO over the last few years, because now I'm prepared for both outcomes and have at the very least taken some profits."

Just curious why people fomo in the 350+, sell at a loss, don’t buy back when it on a nice slow incline. But I guess that goes in part to self control.

It then turned right around and shot up even more to almost $8, which would have been 75% profit. Kinda sucked, but I would have rather taken a 30% profit rather than watch it fall back to $4.50. It winded up going back to $7 and has been hovering around that ever since, so I just consider myself lucky that I got in right before it jumped and I could have lost all those gains if I got greedy and kept buying more, especially around $8."

If the fundamentals are still good, or haven't changed, then why sell? Just because others are doing so?  


I bought 3 stocks of GME at DCA of $105, sold two on the way down because 'trend is the friend', opportunity cost of money etc, regained $110 from that.   
Held on to one out of emotion fueled stubbornness - got stop lossed out of it on the next pump session at $270, meaning I made a slight profit on it.  


Crystalising the loss because everyone told me it was a loser would have sucked more, and has really hammered home the completely unhinged nature of today's social media fuelled markets.

2021-05-31 01:31:38,stocks,"I see what your implication is, but there was no $50k risk with an actively managed position. Even if SPY tanked hard, I could have rolled for a credit in seconds and held out. Regardless, my brokerage allows me to collateralize with margin and I had a stop loss set for the possibility of a major correction. This was an over simplified explanation of my actual trade, I was watching like a hawk, picked a great entry point, and closed the trade within 3 hours of opening. I also only open these positions on days when there is no news due to report such as inflation or employment numbers or a presidential speech regarding the economy.

And yes, AMC was a gamble, as much of a gamble as it is to own that stock with a cost basis of less than $3 per share. I just so happened to be holding shares instead of collecting premium at the right time and sold when I had hit my exit target.

Maybe it’s my lack of understanding. My positions are 10th of that (5k is a big number for me) and it’s usually I get stepped out with a stop loss which is much easier with spy than other tickers obviously but rolling it? How would you roll a 0dte and when? Also would you add to the position (keep 500 contracts) or use the same amount dollar wise to roll? I’m also curious as to when you’d choose to roll. If you’re close to the bell then you’re very close to 50% loss almost instantly with the dip that occurred in the last few hours. Just a bunch of random questions about your process and risk management. If you don’t mind.

Also rolling is realizing loss. Which is great for tax purposes i get it but still closing the position and re opening.

Everything with the price of GME is a technical event that only involves the stock market.  If you were to gauge it based upon fundamentals it is worth less than $10 a share.  Buying in at $450 without using a stop loss is a recipe for disaster.  Really you shouldn't touch it unless you intend on being a trader and have your exit position already planned.  If you know even a little bit about what you're doing you wouldn't have bought at $450.

2021-05-31 08:09:46,stocks,"So, these are great questions.

How would I roll a 0DTE? Well, SPY has 3 expirations per week and all of them carry extrinsic value pretty damn well up to the last hour of the trading day. If the chart is indicating to me that we are going to be within like $0.25 of my short strike at close, I will roll out to the next position, same strikes. There is enough time value and increased volatility due to the current dip to roll for a pretty significant credit. Usually that will be enough and I can still close that same position same day for a 50% profit once the IV dies down going into close.

Twice I’ve wound up wayyyy over my head on these positions and both times I just rolled for a 14 day to expiration position and wound up closing for a profit within a few days."

2021-05-31 00:00:00,stocks,"Basic bitch question(s) about selling options contracts. I was recently approved for options on my TD account after ~10 years of only buying and then selling stocks and ETFs like a boomer.  Before I dive head first into selling options contracts I was hoping to get some confirmation on how it works. 

Say I have a 100 shares of $xyz and am bearish on it. I sell covered calls to open and collect the premium. Then if the contract expires worthless that's it. If the buyer choses to excersise I get paid strike price x100.

However if I am bullish on $xyz I would sell a put contract to open at a price I would be willing to buy 100 shares at.  Then I'm paid a premium. Then if $xyz goes up I buy at the strike price and then if it goes down nothing happens and I only keep the premium.

Is any of that off base?  I *think* I get the basics of options trading, but like I said before I jump into selling contracts I want to make sure I fully understand.  I'm perfectly happy to ignore options, as boomer trading the last decade or so has had left me beating the market quite handily. But that said I'm still curious about a tool that I may not be completely utilizing."
2021-05-31 08:15:41,stocks,"If you sell a put it would be below current price if it goes up the value of the contract will go down you can either wait it out and let it expire or buy out the remainder of the contract and pocket the difference.
Now if the stock goes against you and goes below your strike price you will be on the hook for buying those shares so you need to have the cash to do it.  
If it moves against you massively say you sold a 50 put on say Nio and it crashed down below 40$ you would be on the hook to buy 100 share per contract at 50$ a share so you would be underwater right away but if you are bullish long term you can hold those shares and start selling CC on them"
2021-05-30 20:25:16,stocks,"Well in most cases, selling a cash secured put means you do want to be assigned. If you like the stock at $50, but think it's slightly overvalued at $60, you sell that put, and if it goes down to 50,you're in. If if goes to 40, you're in, but since you liked $50, you should be ok seeing it drop to $40"
2021-05-31 13:58:19,stocks,"I find it hard to ""lose"" money selling puts or covered calls. 

I will lose in opportunity costs, but not actual money. 

If I sell a covered call OTM and more than I paid for the stock, then it hits, I made money, just left a little on the table for the guaranteed money. 

If I sell a put, then I am willing to own it at that price. Then, I actually profit since I would have paid that price anyway. 

I don't sell when fully naked."
2021-05-30 22:45:23,stocks,I think selling puts means you think it is bullish. If you are okay buying it at 50 I wouldn’t sell a put and just wait for it to physically drop. If you see there is a larger pullback you wouldn’t be assigned at a strike and could maybe get it cheaper.

2021-05-31 00:00:00,stocks,"Portfolio advice for novice investor Hi everyone. I’m a new investor looking for some input on my portfolio allocation. I am 28 making about $65k a year (contributing 15% to my Roth 401k allocated to a Target date fund) and looking to invest extra $$ every month to an external taxable account (I paid off all my debt last year). I have $5k in said account right now and I am coming into about $20k of inheritance within the next few weeks. I’m looking to grow this money to use for a down payment in about 5 years.

I own a few random stocks that I bought in January with no set plan in mind. Over the past month, I’ve been doing research on how to diversify and what to buy. I’ve decided to invest mainly in ETFs to make it less complicated. Something to set and forget about, rebalancing once or twice year. Here is what I’ve come up with:

- US Equities 60% - made up of SPLG (large cap blend), SCHD (large cap value), IJS (small cap value), XLRE (real estate)

- International 35% - made up of VEA & VWO (to tilt more towards emerging markets than VXUS allows)

- Speculative 5% - keep a couple individuals stocks I own now that I like, such as VUZI and CRLBF

Should I be investing in ETFs focused more on growth instead of value? Is it worth investing in commodity ETFs to hedge against rising inflation?

I appreciate any feedback since I’m new to all this! I know there’s pros/cons to any investment, but I want to gauge my strategy based on my goal. Also looking to see if this is considered a diversified portfolio. Thank you!"
2021-05-30 20:05:30,stocks,"We seem to be in similar life-stages, as I’m also saving up for a down payment in  the next few years. 

For what it’s worth, while my retirement accounts are heavily growth focused, I think your taxable account that you mentioned should be more dividend/value focused to ensure less volatility as you approach putting down a down payment.

Also I like your ETF strategy — it’s a good one!"
2021-05-31 09:03:19,stocks,"I agree that I could accomplish the same by using two or three funds. However, I like the idea of being able to have more control over diversification (such as focusing on lg vs. mid/small caps, growth vs. value, diff sectors, etc). Also, coming from a financial background, I’m  looking to grow my knowledge in the market and challenge myself by building/managing my own wealth. Maybe I’m a little prideful, but the run of the mill Vanguard or whatever institution fund portfolio just doesn’t attract me."
2021-05-31 08:56:02,stocks,"Value stocks would make sense. I was looking at DGRO, PEY, and ONEY as value/dividend options. They all capture large, mid, and some small value caps, but there seems to be some overlap between them all and I was worried about diversifying. I liked SCHD the most of them. I wasn’t trying to focus entirely on dividends and also wanted to mix in some growth, but I agree that mitigating volatility by buying value makes sense with a short timeframe. 

Mind if I ask what you’re invested in? Do you have any recommendations?"
2021-05-31 17:40:19,stocks,DBC tracks commodities but I think there’s more risk in holding commodities than in holding value  add companies across all sectors.

But the market does seem to believe the fed more about their timelines for changes and that they are accurate.

2021-05-31 14:46:21,stocks,On the CCI -100 is oversold and when it crosses in its a Sell Signal and when it crosses out it’s a Buy Signal. The 0 line is a momentum line so when it crosses under it usually goes down 2-4 days at least and going above usually up 2-4 days. The +100 is a buy when it crosses over and a Sell when it crosses under. Smaller caps can have false positives and it’s never 100% perfect but on most stocks it’s right at least 80% of the time and probably 90% or better on large caps. Now these are just showing short momentum swings but good for short trades or getting a good buy price for a long. Check it out on any chart of a large cap and see how accurate it is. It’s basically free money if your looking for short term gains.

Keep in mind that you will mostly be given advice on US equities here( which is fine. I am exlusively invested in US equities).

If you want to invest money in DAX though then there are various approaches to the DAX as the German stock market is not as ""exciting"" as the US stock market. There is quite an emphasis on dividends.

I understand it is your parent's money. You'd probably be better off investing the majority of it in boring ETFs and a small portion of it in stocks you believe will be a good investment for the future.

My philosophy is that if you invest into stocks semi-actively it‘s more likely for you to keep investing long term which will give you stability from the crippling german retirement system

I think the real question is how much money does that generate compared to the outdoor stuff.

2021-05-30 20:03:46,stocks,"Mostly hype I suspect even though I drive an EV. Saying they will transform their business vs actually coming out on top... My 50 mile round trip to work assuming 20 commutes/month costs me $17/month up until my work installed chargers bring my cost down to zero. I used to be late for work about once a week because I had to get gas and always put it off until the last minute which was inevitably my morning commute. It's a fun little car to drive. My lease is $280/month which probably is a lot for a hatchback but when I don't have to pay for electricity or fuel it feels pretty good. On the other hand we are a two car household and the other car is a minivan. I have zero desire to sell it for an EV. I like having both. I think EVs are the future but companies announcing a switch to 100% EVs in the next 10 years seems like a stretch. Also I like leaving it running and locked with the AC on when running errands because it's nice to not get in a hot car, there isn't a downside for leaving the car on like with an ICE, and a well planned grocery run takes me to three separate stores so keeping the car cool is a huge benefit."
2021-05-31 19:34:46,stocks,"1 - Margins  

Cars are an insanely thin margin business. For companies like Ford, an increase of just 2-3% would change the whole completion of the company. The legacy car makers have really been struggling with margins for a very long time which is why their valuation is low. If margins come up and they start showing growth again, look out above.

2 - Enterprise Software (NOTE: This is a long shot but possible)

There is a very good chance that the company that owns the enterprise fleet space will be able to leverage that to make money from fleet management software in due time. This already exists today but its not taking into account eV's nor charging and the level of complexity for this software is much higher than what exists today. The cost saving potential here is astronomical if you have the right infrastructure and can properly route for max efficiency."
2021-05-30 21:09:09,stocks,"When established auto makers announce realistic and vigorous plans for a switch to EV, and it results in a bump in their share prices, I consider it to be evidence of a wakeup call in the investing world. 

Considering the market cap per vehicle sold metric, TSLA is insane, and companies like RIDE, FSR, HYLN, GOEV are literally dividing by zero. 

So when Ford announces they plan to be a meaningful part of the EV push, it's a reminder to the investing world that Ford already has the infrastructure in place, they already have the customer base, they already have access to literally every market in America. When the free market needs Ford to have an all-electric pickup, there will be one readily available in all corners of the US. 

The price bump is the market coming back down to earth and recognizing what reality is going to look like.

2021-05-30 21:26:56,stocks,"No rolling over. Defeats the purpose.

You never know everything. If you're investing for five years, you think the strength of what you have found will outweigh any of the unknowns, which will always exist in spades. Otherwise why have this discussion? 

News that materially changes the trajectory of the company is a good exception, but you have to determine ahead of time what your key specifics are that have to remain true. 

If you invest, it's because there's something the company is doing that you like. They have to keep doing it. As long as they do, price movements are irrelevant. 

I've put my money where my mouth is with a similar approach. I gave myself a 3-to-5-year window, depending on the rate of progress. I've already made up my mind about the sector/industry, and for the company, I have been able to chart out the top-line revenue targets over the course of the entire 3-5 years (I started at the end of January with this holding). 

As long as they continue to operate in their industry and continue to hit the revenue targets, or miss only for superficial reasons rather than for seismic shifts in the macroeconomy, I'm ride-or-die. I've been up as much as 60%, and I have fallen back into the red from there before stabilizing at a respectable point in my first four months. I've only ever bought this stock without selling a share and it currently stands as 19% of my brokerage portfolio."

It’s really hard to time the market I’ve trimmed or sold off positions I was frustrated with only to see them go on a massive run after I sold.  I know people who try to.l take profits and play with house money and that’s fine but I look at it like you are paying taxes to sell off and move that money so unless the company isn’t going anywhere it’s better to hold"

The video does not talk at all about the longer term knock on effects of the increases in taxes.  Frist, there will be significant decreases in consumer spending as people will simply have less money to spend.  The increase in taxes also mean that the cost of capital will go higher -- this means that fewer businesses will be started and more will fail (compared to having the lower tax rates).  There are other negative factors too -- They all combine to hurt real income growth of workers.

&#x200B;

True, but the problem is you cant just roll your 401k with a shit ton of money in it over to a roth ira. You have to play the 6k/yr game. And if you dont start that shit early on you may start making too much money to be able to do so. So, as far as I can see, the only option is to roll it over to a traditional IRA."

Also also, you mentionned VOO. You will never go wrong with buying SP500 longterm. Its probably the best way to go. However might i Suggest you keep your currency in Canadian Dollars instead. When you flip into americans most banks will give you a disfavorable ratio (2-3% lower).  


Ill show you a good tip to play the currency game and not loose capital. Instead of buying VOO, Buy  


XUS: When the canadian dollars is weak ( 1.30 CDN <= 1 USD )  
XSP: When the canadian dollar is strong (1.15 CDN >= 1 USD)  


XUS is the SP500 un-hedge while the XSP is the hedged version. Both are traded on the toronto stock exchange.

2021-05-31 14:49:57,stocks,True but you shouldn’t be selling it without a clear reentry point. For example when it was massively overbought at $136 you know it’s coming down. I’ve held AAPL for almost 12 years now and I’ve sold it maybe 15 times but it happens. Look at 2018 when it was one of the most hated stocks out there. My profit taking in 2017 paid off when I was able to buy it cheaper. The goal is to make money and if you don’t take profits once in awhile then this is all pointless. I’m also just trimming not selling my older shares. All I trimmed was some of the ones from $90 because that’s a nice run. I still have a huge position with an average of $50 which would be lower but I’ve taken plenty of money out over the years and bought myself AAPL products. That’s what I typically do with profits. You should see my Callaway ( ELY )  golf clubs......

2021-05-31 00:28:37,stocks,"Enterprise is more likely to succeed over consumer products and services (except maybe essentials and low price non-cyclicals). 

From a macro perspective, as the middle class continues to shrink and buying power decreases, as it has been for 40 years, it will be harder to make money from them thus a decline in margins and/or sales is expected especially as population growth has slowed a lot. Enterprise, if anything, will get stronger as the class divide grows because their clients have money and their services are trivially cheap for them.

Also, MSFT has had better growth the last 5 years. Apple had about 17% rev growth since 2015 while MSFT has had 53%. On the earning side, Apple had less than 10% net growth while MSFT had net more than double. Mind you 5 years is pretty arbitrary but i think its safe to say MSFT is definitely growing faster right now and has more upside due to cloud growth as they continue to convert their legacy customers.

Apple will likely be fine long term but at what valuation, I am not sure. Big growth isnt going to happen as they are now. It will boil down to how they use the cash. They do have a lot of it."

What you need to realize is there is a lot of inflation at the moment and stocks typically go up. Spy for instance has returned 9% on average. So if you do some research and decide a stock will increase then put your money where your mind is and then depend on the fundamental movements.

I lost a ton on two things, quick option trades and then getting panicked when I lost money and panicking on any future movement which led to me selling losses when they were going to be gains.

~~The risks have been covered. China is high risk due to having no real checks and balances on government influence over business. The risk is also in their government structure which is currently a dictatorship with a perpetual king running the show. Im not here to argue politics but basically, China is high risk due to having too much power in a few political positions. If Xi wakes up one day and decides to go Lex Luthor, they are all royally flopped.~~

~~Now on the flip side, BABA's valuation is currently attractive at about 25 PE with nice growth still being reported (I tend to believe it). Also, for all we know, Xi might end up being an ok dictator who doesnt destroy his country. Last, it also provides some international diversification.~~

~~I dont hold a lot of foreign stock but I did select 1 Chinese stock and it was BABA for a mix of safety and growth. The position is still small and I am building it slowly but I am only allocating 1% to it. I started buying in the $210 range.~~"

I don't like what the Fed and government are doing right now... going too hot, too long has me worried that we may be creating a giant bubble.  Thus I'm looking for safe non-dollar denominated assets.

I'm bullish on commodities and precious metals as I think inflation may be a problem.  I also like dividend-paying stocks because the fixed income is a nice bond proxy and I think good businesses with good cash flows will perform okay in spite of a downturn. 

I ended up not buying anymore though and just opted to wait.  When there is a significant downturn, whether it be in 6 months or 6 years, I'm going to gobble up all sorts of stuff. I will probably include some US growth in that but only reliable names like MSFT, etc.

2021-05-31 01:37:25,stocks,"Strangle is a volatility strategy in the sense that typically the position is constructed with a non-directional outlook. A strangle involves buying a call and a put at different strike prices. What you are describing is a straddle (same strike price). The volatility characteristics are still the same.

You are positive gamma, meaning you are really banking on a larger move in the SPY than what is already priced in. You are also positive vega so an increase in IV is helpful for this position.

Theta is going to be especially working against you in a long straddle. You also picked a 4 week expiration period which is when the time-value of an option decays at a much accelerated rate. Everyday that the SPY does not move sharply, you are losing money.

The trade is simple, yes. However, you need a movement in the SPY that is beyond both the price of the call and the put. This is typically greater than a 1 standard deviation move. If the SPY does not move enough, you lose everything.

Tracking the VIX is important when trading SPY."

2021-05-31 03:10:00,stocks,"Thank you for the insight. I did not know about VIX at all. But looking at it I can see that most of the spikes in VIX coincide with big events in SPY price.

I also misunderstood Strangle and Straddle. So essentially, in a Strangle I am betting on the directionality being either a little bit more on the upside or downside while hedging for the opposite at a lower strike price. In a Straddle however, I am betting on big move up or down which is why I am buying the call and put at the same strike price.

You mention that theta will be working against me so is it common practice to buy shorter dated options since theta will eat up the premiums paid? Or is that specific to this case since I think the report will be in under a week or two in which case it is better to buy an option expiring in \~2 weeks.

Also, most of what I am thinking about is based how SPY has been wobbly recently based on inflation news. I observed that when there was news of inflation from Yellen, SPY saw comparatively big losses for a couple of days. So I was thinking there could be similar price movement in SPY if there is another report. Good news leading to a rally and bad news leading to a downturn similar to what happened on May 12.

The risk is that if there is not much movement, I stand to lose everything. So the risk factor would be that SPY needs a huge change for me to realize any potential gains."
2021-05-30 20:54:42,stocks,Ofc some ppl can make money off gambling. This sub is more about the investing side of the stocks than the fundamental-less “too the moon”.
2021-05-31 04:04:46,stocks,"The VIX essentially represents the implied volatility of the SPY 30 dte option. However, it is also the annualized rate. So for example if the SPY closed at 400 and the VIX is at 10, it means that in one year you can expect the spy to move +/- 40 with a 68% certainty (1 standard deviation).

Here is a quick video explaining the relationship between SPX and VIX https://youtu.be/BcA5c46B1QY

Remember, an option's implied volatility represents the 1 standard deviation move up or down of the stock price for that particular strike and dte.

With regards to your strangle/straddle question. If you bought an at-the-money straddle vs strangle where both the call and put are equidistant from the stock price... Without factoring in volatility skew there is no directionality preference. If you looked at the profit & loss chart of both spreads you will see that being true. Straddles are V-shaped while strangles are U-shaped.

Of course you can make either spread bullish or bearish by moving your strike prices together.

Long strangles are cheaper than long straddles because you are buying out-the-money calls and puts. This means that the underlying has to move the combined cost of the call and put above or below your upper or lower strikes. This is less likely to happen.

So anytime you in a positive gamma position (meaning you require a market move), you will be negative theta. You have paid money (net debit) to open your position and the time value of your option will decay every passing day (theta decay). If you look at a chart of theta decay versus time to expiration, you will notice that theta decays at an accelerated rate the closer you get to expiration. This rate is especially fast when there are less than 30 days. You give yourself very little room for error when you go with these options. https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/are-there-comprehensive-analyses-of-theta-decay-in-weekly-options

You have to understand how the impact of changes in IV will affect option pricing. Usually when there is a binary event such as earnings you will expect to see a drop in implied volatility after. This will decrease the price of options. Since you are positive vega (increase in iv helps you, decrease hurts you), that's bad. We can only speculate as to when this information will be released and how that will affect IV so you have to take that into consideration."

Diversification is a means of reducing volatility. You can diversify by buying two things in a sector, two different sectors, markets, countries, etc., by buying different types of securities, different denominations, or any choice of investment that decouples part of your portfolio from the rest in some way. That includes trades for instruments of different durations: 90-day T-Bills vs 2-Year Notes, for example. What I'm saying is that a multiyear hold is a diversification into the underlying growth of an equity and out of the more volatile daily swings of the same equity."
