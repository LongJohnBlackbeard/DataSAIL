2021-05-19 19:43:32,wallstreetbets,Well seeing how everything else I feel bullish about usually shits out I think I might have to buy some puts
2021-05-19 19:55:06,wallstreetbets,"anyone whos on the hype train ride at your own risk. congrats if you're in and out fast but I bought puts and selling pmcp on this bitch all the way down. puts gonna be cheapest as this thing hypes towards earnings (gonna be a complete battery pack dumpster fire) and shitty open house week. rofls, even literal glacial speed ford got an ev truck out before these losers. they even got joe biden to drive it first. these guys are gonna get crushed even if they manage to make a car that doesn't break down or explode within 50 miles of driving.

after fake orders, pathetic race drop out, literal test vehicle meltdown and inferno, and goldman sachs beatdown for licensing untested tech for their motors, this stock gives zero confidence."

2021-05-19 19:31:30,wallstreetbets,Soon as I read the title of your post I knew what terrible choice you made. Can’t spell garbage without the letters  UWMC. Seriously though I’m very interested to know why are you decided to invest here?
2021-05-19 19:08:18,wallstreetbets,You lost 93% of your portfolio? Lmfao 🤣

2021-05-19 18:42:03,wallstreetbets,"Everything doesn't have to be a short squeeze.  Amazing how ""short interest"" is part of everyone's dd now.... instead of spending time on researching what a bunch of traders are doing,  research the companies Financials."
2021-05-19 19:09:00,wallstreetbets,"> Your pets are telling you something

Yes, I'm interested!.



> short squeeze

For fuck's sake."
2021-05-19 18:29:28,wallstreetbets,"Oh look, another wsb short squeeze."
2021-05-19 18:27:12,wallstreetbets,Okay Ryan
2021-05-19 19:16:59,wallstreetbets,"At this point, it's too late for most of us to make any plays before earnings tomorrow, but let's get a few things clear.

1. Good earnings or not, short squeeze isn't happening. This reminds me a lot of a month or so ago when people were saying the same thing about $ASO. It was and still is a great buy, but it never squeezed. It's gain was purely fundamental. There is still not enough shorts being made compared to the amount of volume the stock trades daily. Volume is not good enough to warrant a spiking increase, which means there is less chance of a margin call occurring. Obviously, a whale could come in, but if it didn't happen for $ASO, I doubt it will happen here.
2. This might be a decent play either way. For bulls, this could be a discount $ASO repeat where we might see a, at least, $4 stock price increase over the next business week. The company has had nine quarters in row of revenue increase. That's impressive that the trend continued through COVID. Obviously, holiday sales will not be on this quarter's earnings, but if revenue kept going up, they are likely to still be a profitable brick and mortar company. Company also offers grooming services and is getting into vet business as well. Not to mention all their items are overpriced as hell. IE. Like $ASO this could be good long term hold.
3. Bears have obviously shorted the stock. Possible reasoning could be that for one, holidays are over, so sales could have gone down. Chewy is still growing in users and I would assume is $WOOF's number 1 competitor. From being in Petco's the regulars tend to be older, meaning it has an aging consumer base. An all online business like Chewy is much more ideal for the younger crowd, which means $WOOF might be on a ticking clock. Outside of convivence if you live by one and looking at little animals to buy, PETCO doesn't have much of an edge over Chewy, in my opinion.

TLDR: Wait till earnings tomorrow. There ain't going to be a short squeeze but I would like to buy puts if earnings are bad, shares if earnings are good. Hold for probably two weeks until the stock stabilizes in either direction. Volume isn't that high so once it stops moving, it's not moving till next quarter end."
2021-05-19 18:29:04,wallstreetbets,But look at all those hot girls in the woof shirts!
2021-05-19 18:29:21,wallstreetbets,Woof woof
2021-05-19 19:33:06,wallstreetbets,This is a more convincing dd for going short than long...
2021-05-19 19:55:33,wallstreetbets,I'm a simple man. I see short squeeze and I downvote.
2021-05-19 19:33:11,wallstreetbets,I thought Dunder Mifflin was a paper company?
2021-05-19 19:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Squeeze deez, please. Seriously though, whatever."

2021-05-19 18:43:11,wallstreetbets,But isn’t every stock in for a squeeze?

2021-05-19 17:49:52,wallstreetbets,"8000 put contracts isn't really that ""giant"".  Media keeps quoting the notional value of the contracts based on the value of 800k shares but wsb should know better than that.  

Buying 8000 contracts at $0.01 premium per share would give you the same notional value as Burry for 8000 bucks."

2021-05-19 17:35:57,wallstreetbets,Exactly! This also applies to other false prophets such as Musk and Burry. They manipulate the market like I play with my dog.
2021-05-19 18:41:50,wallstreetbets,"If he has 8000 contracts short at a 800 strike, he's already up around $200m on the delta alone, which is about the size of his fund's AUM. You retards really think Burry is trading penny options? Fucking jokers."
2021-05-19 17:53:46,wallstreetbets,"I read that it was a 530 million worth of puts 🤷‍♂️, possible article was wrong. Was just fresh in my memory."
2021-05-19 18:14:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but the Burry BallLickers™ still need to get off somehow. No telling what the details of his position are. But Musk is the ultimate short destroyer and Burry’s thesis is the same ole hubris and misunderstanding. Time will tell"

2021-05-19 18:39:39,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-19 19:48:05,wallstreetbets,I'd let her peg me 🤤🤤🤤
2021-05-19 17:43:43,wallstreetbets,Musk is a social media charlatan. Burry is the real deal.
2021-05-19 19:55:52,wallstreetbets,Tesla about to go down hill fast. ⛷️⛷️⛷️
2021-05-19 18:46:29,wallstreetbets,"Sure he's probably up but that's not the point.  We're talking about notional value reported by the media vs whatever he actually spent on the put contracts.  And the fact is noone knows.  

Could be 800 strike, 700 strike, a bazillion strike..."
2021-05-19 17:57:33,wallstreetbets,"That's the notional value I'm referring to.  530 million value divided by 8000 put contracts = about $660 something which works out to exactly the closing share price on march 31 when the position was opened.

The key information that they don't tell us is what strike and expiry.  So really it doesn't mean much.  But at the end of the day it's just 8000 put contracts.  

Not to mention scion capital doesn't even have a half billion dollars to make such a bet anyways.  If you look at the combined value of ALL the positions they hold and the value of the fund is below a half billion

Edit: their assets under management is 638 million so they do have more than a half billion in assets but obviously they wouldn't wager 80 percent of their fund on a bet like this"
2021-05-19 18:05:09,wallstreetbets,Of course that's not to say they did that but just to highlight the issue with just reporting notional value :D

2021-05-19 19:08:12,wallstreetbets,"Musk has created multiple billion dollar companies. Burry got one call right once. His current investments are water, gold, farmland, and shorting tesla.  Hard to say this guy is the real deal."

2021-05-19 18:47:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, Dr. Burry could be trading a bazillion strike or a penny option. He's just as retarded as this sub. There's no way to guess whether or not he might have bought options at or near the money."
2021-05-19 18:38:10,wallstreetbets,F the media
2021-05-19 18:55:46,wallstreetbets,"Plus his long-standing short position, which is undisclosed. The options are new but likely a small portion of his total short."
2021-05-19 19:08:12,wallstreetbets,"Not unless with absolute conviction he knew it was going to happen.
Nor mention the tweets he put out in regards to TSLA tanking then had a visit and was boo’d off Twitter.
I have to side with Burry more than anything especially once I jump off here and read the TSLA chart is performing identically to CSCO of 2000-2001…TSLA immediately after a confident earnings call loses their buyer for credits, China weighs in, production slowed by chip delays, etc.
Beauty of human psychology, it always tends to repeat itself"
2021-05-19 18:01:46,wallstreetbets,"Nice, thanks for the free wrinkles!"
2021-05-19 18:09:24,wallstreetbets,Got it. Thought you were trying to imply it would be possible to have bought TSLA puts at 0.01 prem
2021-05-19 18:25:57,wallstreetbets,Fuck Jim Cramer as well.

2021-05-19 19:52:45,wallstreetbets,"Uh his short position on Tesla started Q1 so it's already hella profitable... He also called GME... He's not gotten ""one call right once."" To pretend like he has is ignorant at best."
2021-05-19 19:10:51,wallstreetbets,"Umm seems pretty legit to me, If what he thinks is true and that hyperinflation is coming then these bets will pay off massively..."
2021-05-19 18:52:32,wallstreetbets,"That's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about the media's reporting of the notional value being deceptive.  Not about whether the bet was a good idea or not.

2021-05-19 18:13:57,wallstreetbets,"Actually you can.  Again without regard to strike or expiry which we know neither of in burrys bet but i could buy a 2dte $20 strike put right now for 0.01 per share.  

The crazy thing was I remember there was a surge of activity and $20puts bought a while ago.  Something not normal.  But not to say it was burry since there's lots of people trying to manipulate the price out there

Here's the link to an article talking about it.

2021-05-19 19:21:56,wallstreetbets,"Hyperinflation would cause everything to rise including tesla. For him to be right,  there would need to be a break down of civilization which would null his paper ownership and we would move to a local warlord economy. He wouldn't make any money from it and would most likely be eaten by the mob. Sure the crap he's invested in can go up but compared to rest of the market I highly doubt it."

2021-05-19 19:39:13,wallstreetbets,"Burry manages a multi billion dollar fund who’s only objective is to not get obliterated in the next crash. I’m on Burrys boat about the inflation tsunami, so I tend to think his fairly safe bet in assets is a sensible thing to do."
2021-05-19 19:31:10,wallstreetbets,"I mean this may or may not be true, under a state of hyperinflation commodites would rise way quicker then luxuries. When everyones savings gets obliterated, no one will be looking to buy a Tesla they will be buying essentials. Land, Water and precious metals are need much more then electric cars. Just look at commodity stocks after even the mention of inflation. On top of this Id imagine he is making plays that will actually recover quick after a market crash. I have a hard time believing any hyper growth stocks will recover anytime soon after a crash."
2021-05-19 19:50:24,wallstreetbets,He would feel so smart though.
2021-05-19 19:56:39,wallstreetbets,This...

2021-05-19 19:48:15,wallstreetbets,Everyone’s selling or cutting their Apple shares it seems. Innovation ended with Stevie Jobs. Tim Apples a good boss / manager but ain’t a disruptor that Apple used to be. Their last few reveals were super lackluster. No one even watched them anymore.

I heard this argument in 2013"

2021-05-19 18:03:40,wallstreetbets,Markets are forward looking. Look ten years into the future. It’s EV’s that will be next wave not Facebook access devices. Why do you think Apple said they were going to build an EV? They know too.
2021-05-19 18:26:04,wallstreetbets,In phones Apple has one company to compete with. In cars they have probably 20
2021-05-19 18:10:45,wallstreetbets,"The big new product last year was $500 headphones. Headphones….Apple TV sucks. The watch is already saturated. No one cares if they put their own chips inside the macs. That’s purely a cost saving move.

2021-05-19 18:32:04,wallstreetbets,"I need Apple to increase by September. Do you think it could reach $140 by then, or is it time to sell and buy some Ape Stuff? lol"
2021-05-19 19:03:10,wallstreetbets,No I don’t but it’s probably a good stock long term. They make cool shit. But the growth they have experienced since 2000 will be near impossible to replicate.

2021-05-19 16:48:59,wallstreetbets,If we find support at 412 Ill play 0dte but I want to see what futures bring.
2021-05-19 17:23:53,wallstreetbets,I made 80% today doing that. Figure I'll sell Thurs or Friday and then buy puts for next Wednesday. If we are at or above 417 on Friday I'm def buying puts.

2021-05-19 17:49:19,wallstreetbets,It depends on futures tonight IMO and if we test 415 tomorrow. But if you have like a 400p you might be f'ed if we don't gap down tomorrow morning IMO. But lets see!

Kind of in shambles at this point, but lets see. if the gapdown doesnt fk me, the theta will. Figuring out what to do because I'm on my last legs here, told myself no more re-financing, make it or break time so trying to figure out what to do.

The Covid second-wave fear is unfounded for countries that have started ramping up vaccinations. More and more studies are coming out that the variants just don't know how to get around the vaccines (and potentially cannot due to limitations of their protiens).  


Inflation is always... ALWAYS the bogeyman, but remember the chatter about it always spikes when there is a definate movement towards raising the minimum wage. This doomsday scenario never comes.  


The only real issue is social instability and global conflict points flaring up (Middle East, US Race Relations, Russia, China) that would really spook the markets.  


The market loves certainty and the majority in the market are from a generation of predictable patterns. This is more back to business as usual, but amplified. If boomers are out there still in the game, they're probably making a killing right now. Xers are getting pantsed, but Millennials might be the most suited to rolling with the punches if they got the resources.  


All in all, the market is nuts, but the world is nuts too."

2021-05-19 19:24:32,wallstreetbets,"Huge Put option play on AMC over the next week.  Last time there was a bull run on the stock got to the same resistance (3/11-3/18) up 42.1% then on 3/19 slight drop of (0.5%) and then followed up by a (10.3%) drop on 3/22 and further drops of (14.7%) on 3/23 and (15.4%) on 3/24.  

We’ve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options."

2021-05-19 18:44:55,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-19 16:28:02,wallstreetbets,what was your buy in price?
2021-05-19 16:57:52,wallstreetbets,Smart to sell a covered call to earn back a little income. The problem is now you're stuck holding all those shares which will probably be worth $9 next week.
2021-05-19 18:21:04,wallstreetbets,"If AMC go up only that is a sing of trouble, a healthy gain most be up and down but slide up in between. Relax we will cash in with AMC."
2021-05-19 18:03:48,wallstreetbets,"I just wanted to understand what is the magic bullet that will make AMC trade consistently above $20, which happened in the summer 2017 for the last time?"
2021-05-19 17:27:20,wallstreetbets,I am selling AMC at $25
2021-05-19 18:57:18,wallstreetbets,"Naked options are the fuel to squeezes and gamma squeezes. It’s excellent money short term but you WILL lose money long term. The short term gains are near infinite though with no money down so I think that continues to be the reason why we will continue to see this kind of behavior.... no matter how many “billions” of dollars shorts lose in the long term. 

Anyways shorts r fuk, but not before they cash out billions on short term naked plays. They get bailed out anyways, so they’ll do it again lol

Messed up world we live in I guess."
2021-05-19 17:02:10,wallstreetbets,"So they keep selling calls after the calls expired, and again, and again"
2021-05-19 18:29:19,wallstreetbets,Share count in the summer of 2017 was 53-55m depending on the date. Now 9x shares in existence.
2021-05-19 17:06:24,wallstreetbets,The premium becomes smaller and smaller. And eventually you get assigned at $9 or something when you could have sold weeks ago for $14. Anyway you'll see. A quick look at AMC's price history tells you where this is heading.

2021-05-19 18:24:51,wallstreetbets,This trade was a share purchase not an option trade. So the premium is never in question here I think.
2021-05-19 19:17:51,wallstreetbets,Why would the premium become smaller?  And why would he sell a $9 strike?  Not trying to be mean but it sounds like you don't understand options very well.  They will likely be able to knock 10-15% off of their cost basis every 4-6 weeks.
2021-05-19 19:56:30,wallstreetbets,"As IV drops selling out of the money calls returns less and less. He will eventually need to start selling lower strike prices to get any reasonable premium. Basically, he's more or less fucked because of his high cost basis.

I buy and sell options and write calls and puts regularly. In his situation covered calls is the best option if he wants to hold the stock but he'd only write those if he doesn't believe it's going to moon and if he doesn't believe it's going to moon why even own it? AMC is a shit company heavily in debt."

LBRDA: Somesort of broadband comapny, pays out a dividend, consensus price target is above its current 159 price. 

BGNE: Chinese biotech, ""Burkinsa"" drug has been put on ""priority review"" by the FDA (don't know if that means much), looks like a good bet on cancer treatments (maybe?)

NRG: Power producer and distributor in Texas. The increase in revenue growth might be related to the winter storms a couple months ago. The high increase in growth might just be recovery from those lows.

I'm looking to increase position to about 50k in shares and 25k in long dated calls. I'm stopping out below 33-34 but this thing will rocket with states starting to adopt online gambling and with sports starting back in full swing this fall.

This will jump to previous highs very quickly, 15B market cap, losing money to pay for advertisements but revenue expectation raised from 900M to 1.15B this year. 13 potential states opening up within the next 2 years to legalized gambling. International bettors hopefully get a piece of the action as well. It's only a matter of time. You'll be kicking yourself in 10 years when this, PENN and others are trading 5x from here.

Also I think the bottom is almost in for growth stocks, we have seen fear and capitulation take over the last 3 months as retail traders bleed themselves out. When you hear about people giving up that's the best time to get back in.

Here's a theory. 2 of the above bubbles have now popped, one has lost over 50-70% of value slowly since february, the other has lost a lot these past few days. Again, the sequence but in reverse. Kind of.

2021-05-19 16:07:28,wallstreetbets,It’s not my favorite pattern. I’m partial to tits up. But it’s still better than tits down.
2021-05-19 16:49:11,wallstreetbets,I think your timing was off is all.  We got the catalyst last week.  Quarterly dividend plus buy back.  It was the same catalyst rkt used to squeeze the first time
2021-05-19 19:36:17,wallstreetbets,Probably right after you sold.

2021-05-19 19:44:07,wallstreetbets,thanks i try hard
2021-05-19 17:55:31,wallstreetbets,what im saying is if you are conscious even to write that why did you execute the trade? what was the thought process? why not just hold after that?
2021-05-19 19:04:25,wallstreetbets,AAPL was my savings account after doubling up on small cap stocks. I should have cashed out pre earnings run up but didn’t. AAPL is planning on a share buyback and I think it has more room to drop. 119 is my target to enter back in.
2021-05-19 19:53:23,wallstreetbets,Never bet against AAPL as long as they have a cult following.
2021-05-19 19:59:36,wallstreetbets,Definitely not betting against them but when I have 1080 shares these small drops in price are killing me. I’m taking my small gains and sitting on the sidelines ready to pounce. I’d like to add shares 1100 is my number
2021-05-19 18:25:54,wallstreetbets,Yea it’s called shorting arkk you clown
2021-05-19 15:10:53,wallstreetbets,IMO gene editing will be the future of health care relatively soon so I do invest in a couple companies. But thats just me.
2021-05-19 14:48:11,wallstreetbets,Short ARKK you doofus
2021-05-19 14:58:25,wallstreetbets,You’re a pussy
2021-05-19 14:45:23,wallstreetbets,Why not just use options to take an artificial inverse position?

2021-05-19 15:06:15,wallstreetbets,I’m curious as to why you think decreasing Netflix is a bad idea?
2021-05-19 16:31:12,wallstreetbets,"She predicts CoinBit $500,000. -- Crazy, but not impossible  
  
She is all-in on Tesla. -- Probably not advisable   
  
She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time. -- The future of the biggest industry on earth, can't think of a better bet to make  
  
She has decreased her position in Netflix. -- In the middle of their best case scenario (a pandemic where people were forced to sit at home) they made less than $3 billion profit on a greater than $200 billion market cap. Very clear short case.

&#x200B;

So based on your comments, two of which make sense and two of which don't, I guess you think flipping a coin is the investment strategy for you?"
2021-05-19 14:46:48,wallstreetbets,"Just make ur own fund and do the opposite of her.

Regarding Tesla, ur either with her or with burry."
2021-05-19 18:36:10,wallstreetbets,"Morningstar considers Netflix as 95% overvalued. Tesla is worth the risk at the prices that ARKK paid, they could rule the world one day.  Gene editing is the future and each success in the many steps forward to achieving a product will see a stock spike.

Some thing like ARKK has a place in everyone’s portfolio.  When investing in high growth; the goal is to buy 10 stocks and hope just 1 hits it big, it is clear that Cathy is more likely to find those 10 baggers than most of us."

2021-05-19 15:06:32,wallstreetbets,"Well that's not her name, so maybe you should reevaluate."
2021-05-19 18:05:10,wallstreetbets,You got me pegged.
2021-05-19 14:50:12,wallstreetbets,Her thesis on Tesla is that they have more data. Which makes no sense to me. She thinks data will somehow magically create AI self-driving cars.
2021-05-19 16:32:55,wallstreetbets,Exactly
2021-05-19 19:13:50,wallstreetbets,I thought this was Wendys? What’s Cathies?
2021-05-19 17:03:30,wallstreetbets,Retards think she is hot which means you must be wrong
2021-05-19 14:49:37,wallstreetbets,Put on arkk done
2021-05-19 14:48:35,wallstreetbets,It’s really not
2021-05-19 19:21:05,wallstreetbets,"I was with you at first... But, now I think she might be a little smarter than you (us)."
2021-05-19 15:31:45,wallstreetbets,You don’t know do you? Buy a put and sell a call ATM on ARKK. It’s called synthetic short stock.
2021-05-19 14:49:54,wallstreetbets,"True, but if you are confident in your position?"
2021-05-19 15:00:19,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that is what an ETF is for."
2021-05-19 16:24:26,wallstreetbets,"Her ideas aren't worth shit without adding a position. If she has no money in it, it's just words. You will comprehensively short everything (even to the percentage) by shorting her ETFs."
2021-05-19 15:34:56,wallstreetbets,"So let me preface by saying I do not agree with Cathy on a lot of things and I do feel that she over exposes herself without a hedge quite commonly. During the tech bust the last few months, she hasn’t shown any shorts or derivatives to profit on the down market. Coinbit to 500,000k is a bit ridiculous, however given its limited supply (21m) and inflationary markets, it could be looked at as a digital commodity which will keep it rising.

Netflix however is a company that I have felt could be in trouble for a while now. Given that anybody that owns content is starting their own streaming service, it doesn’t make sense for them to keep Netflix as a middle man because they offer a currently premium streaming platform. While they do own some of their own content, I feel like it is very hit or miss and that could drive consumers to look at their competitors. While their financial are healthy in the present state, I feel they could fall victim to diminishing margins very quickly. The one wild card for me with Netflix is that they could go out and buy some content through M&A activity that  could make them a player for a longer time.
 
That is just my opinion on it though, however I can respect the other side of the argument as well"
2021-05-19 18:40:18,wallstreetbets,Netflix is loaded down with debt and they are continuing to add debt to create or buy content. What happens when debt becomes more expensive and subscriber growth stalls or declines?
2021-05-19 15:08:23,wallstreetbets,"She’s investing for long term. People talking about them in their early stages are clowns. Wood, woods, who cares..."
2021-05-19 14:55:14,wallstreetbets,data is what feeds AI
2021-05-19 14:53:15,wallstreetbets,You obviously don't know how ai is developed.
2021-05-19 15:30:09,wallstreetbets,Bruh that data alone is worth billions
2021-05-19 15:11:30,wallstreetbets,OP if you view Tesla as a software company that can make autonomous level V CAV. That means humans for driving are obsolete. Cars can zip past each other at 70 mph and no one has to stop on a red light. Tesla with added capacity in Europe and China and its constant innovation with top notch data in a right now well positioned to capture this market

2021-05-19 17:01:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't believe in Cathy either BUT I think Coinbase has potential to serve as a new robinhood to Criptoe. Interestingly enough, all the crashes weve seen, (1920's, 1970's, 1990's) was due too such an influx of uninformed investors. I think Coinbase has an extremely attractive buy price in the future as Criptoe keeps dropping, but now isn't the time. If it hits 175 I'd start thinking about it. Could be an RH for Criptoe if they don't pull a GME. I was bullish on RH till the January debauchery 

Idk if the C word is allowed so I spelled it that way"
2021-05-19 15:48:15,wallstreetbets,"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/netflix-statistics/

Scroll to the content statistics. I own Netflix first for its streaming revenue and potential to expand outside the US, second for its data, third as a studio."
2021-05-19 15:17:59,wallstreetbets,How long will the capital stick around waiting for the long term.
2021-05-19 15:16:59,wallstreetbets,">Tesla with added capacity in Europe and China and its constant innovation with top notch data in a right now well positioned to capture this market

There is no reason to think Tesla will be the company to deliver self-driving in my opinion and if they do 15 years from now, it would not justify their valuation today."
2021-05-19 18:27:01,wallstreetbets,"Paypal is the way to play craptocurrency.  Payal gets their cut of transactions, buy or sell."
2021-05-19 16:08:27,wallstreetbets,"So yes the streaming revenue growth has been impressive, however how much of that was due to price increases instead of subscription growth? Any time a company has abnormal growth as NFLX is currently showing, they will naturally attract competition into the arena. Since they don’t own many well known titles, I believe that if other content owners could start pulling the license that Netflix has with them to create their own streaming service, essentially cutting out the middle man being Netflix. I could be completely wrong on this view, however this is why I do not own Netflix personally."
2021-05-19 15:31:17,wallstreetbets,It is already years ahead than other car manufacturers
2021-05-19 19:17:59,wallstreetbets,So does coin

2021-05-19 15:49:59,wallstreetbets,"Ah, the perfect plays would have been holding a 408c a little longer. Sold it as soon as it was green, but it rocketed to what could have been a 12k play. Also could have turned a 2k loss on a 408p into a 3k gain if I’d held it until that dump around 2pm ET"
2021-05-19 17:09:15,wallstreetbets,"We trade extremely similar it seems. Up 12k on the week, will be down 3k tomorrow, but have some positions i opened at 4:14 that should fix the 3k."
2021-05-19 16:48:13,wallstreetbets,"With that amount of trading, ask your broker to lower it to $0.50"
2021-05-19 16:02:00,wallstreetbets,"It’s hard to time the ticks on an etf since the bid/ask can get blown through in seconds... the last 30 minutes of $2 movement x4 are a perfect example. Trust me, from a trader’s perspective that’s as close to perfect as you can get. Pat yourself on the back and drink a beer for me."
2021-05-19 17:01:17,wallstreetbets,"So in other words, yes take 120mg XRs orrr? OP check flow with either $TICK (NYSE) or $TICK/Q(Nasdaq)— this will help when timing those pops and drops when we have choppiness like today. We must make you faster, stronger."
2021-05-19 19:41:03,wallstreetbets,FOMC minutes were released at 2. If you’re trading crazy shit like this you definitely need to know about those events that are listed weeks in advance lol

2021-05-19 14:05:26,wallstreetbets,So what’s the actual play? Excuse my ignorance but is it just a simple buy and hold for you? What sort of exit strategy do you recommend?
2021-05-19 14:05:33,wallstreetbets,I felt bad because I was checking the earnings report after a lady was killed by equipment last week.

2021-05-19 14:03:14,wallstreetbets,I was- I have other positions now. I actually bought purple today because these offerings do the same thing every single time.
2021-05-19 16:16:52,wallstreetbets,"The mattress needs a good filler, what else is better :)

sorry too soon but couldn’t resist"
2021-05-19 19:55:11,wallstreetbets,This will likely be the last offering for purple.

2021-05-19 19:20:37,wallstreetbets,There was a a recent manufacturing incident that resulted in the the death of an employee. Didn't see many news articles related to it and only a couple comments on forums.

2021-05-19 14:55:09,wallstreetbets,I thought the title of this post was relative retardation since I might be asking for a refund of my 5/21 10c. Still holding out hope though for sky daddy to bless us all.
2021-05-19 14:11:01,wallstreetbets,"With the amount of cheap money going around, with still substandard stress testing by the lenders that would use their services, it’s not unrealistic that they have seen a significant jump in earnings and activity. 

I’m curious to know what the near future has in store, since housing builds are stalled with high costs and supply chain disrupted. Are existing home sales expected to carry Q1/2 momentum? Will they be healthy in Q3/4 with only one side of the equation operating at full steam?"

2021-05-19 18:59:56,wallstreetbets,I bought into UWMC at 8.20 on its way up a couple months back. Glad to be back in the green.

2021-05-19 18:31:27,wallstreetbets,1100 deep as well. Looking for tendies.
2021-05-19 15:01:38,wallstreetbets,I'm lost why do you have puts on UWMC for 6/18 if you think it's going up? Do you think it'll dip next month?
2021-05-19 15:46:20,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, swirlies. That UWMC swirly looks really good to me."

2021-05-19 14:23:00,wallstreetbets,"Good questions, I guess I have 2 arguments based on how someone would want to play this.

Like I already mentioned, in the short term you have Russell consideration, Ex-Dividend, & the associated hype. I did forget to mention the share buybacks that will be occurring as well, however this could occur over a longer period of time (which is still good).

As far as long term, material shortages don’t last forever. Not all their revenue come from new construction sales (it’s actually quite small). Their Debt to equity ratio is 0.45 which is very low. The P/E ratio is also low compared to the industry and the market."
2021-05-19 15:18:09,wallstreetbets,"Are housing builds stalled? I'm not sure. In April, the March data showed 1.7 million new home starts, which beat the expectation of 1.6 million. Forward looking demand suggests there needs to be 1.2 million starts per month to keep up and anything more than that will go towards helping the overheating home prices by increasing supply. Historically high building costs are offset by historically high home prices which are (partly) offset by historically low interest rates + stimmy money."
2021-05-19 15:11:41,wallstreetbets,"he is short puts, that means he sold them to gain premium and is betting that stock won't go low enough to trigger his price, but if it does and the option is exercised he gets allocated to shares at the strike price, in this situation 7$ which is pretty low"

2021-05-19 17:37:40,wallstreetbets,The first digital xerox printer wasnt invented until 1973. You have to put the macros into perspective.
2021-05-19 18:15:55,wallstreetbets,"Shorts will print more, the US economy can't keep growing forever right?"
2021-05-19 19:30:27,wallstreetbets,funny how it looks like it blew up during the stagflation recovery phase.
2021-05-19 14:02:05,wallstreetbets,I’m guessing you’ve never seen an inflation adjusted chart lol. This is linear...of course you’re retarded so why am I wasting characters.
2021-05-19 16:42:01,wallstreetbets,Im a retard i cant tell if this is a joke or if you can actually buy outs on this
2021-05-19 17:36:51,wallstreetbets,Someone doesn’t understand scaling.
2021-05-19 19:50:14,wallstreetbets,"A few things have changed....

1. Population Growth
2. Rise of service sector
3. The interwebs (that thing I'm using right now)
4. The increased flow of foreign capital into US markets.

Reasons there is a bubble/how it  bursts

1. The [MAJORITY](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/central-banker/spring-2007/how-us-currency-stacks-upat-home-and-abroad) of U.S. dollars are outside the US, once the Yuan or Schrute bucks become more popular, those dollars will come back and match the ridiculous spending of the last 10 years to cause hyper inflation
2. [Petrodollar Recycling](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp032306a) is the number one source of demand for US dollars abroad and we have already passed peak oil, reinforcing point #1
3. Foreign guuuvvments have been buying and holding US dollars or Treasury debt (or both) and start dumping their debt. Currently Chairman Xi (Adam Silver's Boss) owns via the CCP 4% of all [US Debt](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/040115/reasons-why-china-buys-us-treasury-bonds.asp)."

2021-05-19 19:39:52,wallstreetbets,This guy's doesn't log
2021-05-19 17:53:02,wallstreetbets,It's because we left the gold standard in '71 which led to inflation systematically weakening the dollar from then on.
2021-05-19 18:00:25,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure this has something to do with the USD being taken off the gold standard in 1971
2021-05-19 19:34:57,wallstreetbets,Use log scale noob
2021-05-19 14:37:05,wallstreetbets,Yeah but also 100 years ago we barely had roads so there is that
2021-05-19 14:42:09,wallstreetbets,I remember my dad saying he bet it would get to 3000!
2021-05-19 15:29:26,wallstreetbets,believe you used the wrong flair my guy

2021-05-19 17:26:26,wallstreetbets,My thoughts are South American mining as the mines there are value for money as they were during the last great depression.
2021-05-19 17:58:47,wallstreetbets,A lot has happened in the last 40 years
2021-05-19 17:59:22,wallstreetbets,Look at when company's switched to a 401k and that will explain it. Money now flows into the market constantly.
2021-05-19 19:11:17,wallstreetbets,Makes sense with the rampant money printing going on
2021-05-19 19:28:37,wallstreetbets,Position or ban!
2021-05-19 14:14:53,wallstreetbets,"It has to do with interest rates. I am not sure before 1950 as I don't have that data in front of me, but from 1950-1980 interest rates increased and from 1980-today interest rates went down. End result is that returns in 1950-1980 were low in the market as stocks were declining in value due to the increasing interest rates (i.e. as the risk-free rate of return increased the required return for stocks increased) and from 1980 onward stocks went up to reflect the lower risk-free rate of return. Had interest rates been steady from 1950-today, you would have had the market increasing steadily from 1950-today... perhaps with a some, but smaller vertical movement recently."
2021-05-19 18:53:12,wallstreetbets,"Before the web site revolution in the 90s there was only brick and morter business, and they had a limited potential for sustained value growth. 

With the internet now being the main driver of new wealth in the world the ability for valuations to look parabolic compared to yesteryear is in effect."

2021-05-19 14:14:54,wallstreetbets,"I'm thinking $800 Puts expiring next month, just to be on the safe side. Clearly a bubble."

2021-05-19 14:55:33,wallstreetbets,God this subreddit is retarded
2021-05-19 18:01:17,wallstreetbets,I’m just wondering if this is satire or you’re actually that dumb.  You don’t think any American businesses before 1990 were huge?  How about Exxon?
2021-05-19 14:02:25,wallstreetbets,Also inflation
2021-05-19 14:28:01,wallstreetbets,Bro it's the omega tech bubble that's been getting pumped since 1903. Rockerfella and Carneggie created the fed to increase M2 to 1000% over the last century but it's about to collapse. DJIA to $300 by october.
2021-05-19 17:42:32,wallstreetbets,Isn’t it the opposite of this? I.e. we used to have sustainable and important businesses but now we just have investment banks and tech companies that add little value to society outside of memes but are worth billions?
2021-05-19 14:05:36,wallstreetbets,No shit sherlock. That was the whole joke.
2021-05-19 14:03:34,wallstreetbets,It.. it was a joke.
2021-05-19 16:42:34,wallstreetbets,Where can I find that chart at?
2021-05-19 19:47:04,wallstreetbets,False. Dow Jones is the boomer index there’s no tech. Pretty sure it’s all shoe shining materials and steel.
2021-05-19 14:57:28,wallstreetbets,"Hmm. Interesting point, but that's probably why the Dow Jones moved nowhere. People found roads, and piled in on the Dow, sending it to 33k. Either way, it's clearly a bubble. The benefit of roads just isn't enough to warrant a 33k change in only 100 years and so I'm shorting. 800 puts are going dirt cheap for some reason. I guess everyone is just oblivious..."
2021-05-19 14:58:13,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it's a bubble. My fancy lines, and say it, and the 1% drop today is boosting my confirmation bias through the ceiling"

2021-05-19 17:15:48,wallstreetbets,"Since there's a decent chance you and a bunch of other retards seriously don't grasp why log scale would be useful, log scale makes moves comparable percentage wise instead of just nominal price. On the scale you're looking at, DOW going from 1000 to 3000 (300% increase) seems like a trivial nonevent, while going from 25k to 30k (25% increase) seems like a giant move. Log scale would fix that."

2021-05-19 18:51:43,wallstreetbets,Well I was actually doing really well on AT&T a few months ago with calls buying when it would dip below 30 because it kept returning to 30 after earnings when they pushed up a bit I kind of expected a 30$ retrace so I just thought it was a bit overvalued and got lucky

2021-05-19 13:38:32,wallstreetbets,lol this isn't a dip
2021-05-19 18:44:05,wallstreetbets,"I'm a novice but have noticed this rather infuriating trend with the dips, and frankly I'll be happier if someone can explain why i'm wrong. I could understand more if these moves were reactionary. Instead it seems like wall street is the problem. Its not retail investors selling off at exactly 9:30am on the day FOMC is making an announcement. It's the ""sophisticated"" big money managers trying to anticipate policy changes and they create this self fulfilling prophecy when they pull their money, then pat themselves on the back at having gotten out before the dip. They have to be hurting themselves. The cost of this mob mentality that exists at the top is a stab in the foot of the economy. Many retail investors are left holding the bag and many cannot afford to ""buy the dip."" Instead, the market has to work until smaller retail investor sentiment turns to see a light at the end of the tunnel. But the market being down has to hurt the big guys too. I dont get it, but I curse them whenever this happens. Not all downward trends... just the sell offs by big money. Again, I'm happy to be wrong here. Thoughts anyone?"

2021-05-19 12:42:09,wallstreetbets,I think they had to do something to save the stock from the shorts.. institutions are mostly short on AMD and long Xilinx to keep advantage of the merge since AMD is technically paying a bit too much for Xilinx.
2021-05-19 16:39:10,wallstreetbets,"R&D is probably at a point where more money can't do shit, only more talent. Plus, after the merger the cashflow will more than justify buybacks and dividends without detriment to R&D. Su bae ain't a dumb dumb CEO like Swan or Gelsinger."
2021-05-19 12:48:48,wallstreetbets,"I mean, they are not artificially inflating the stock price, they are retiring shares from the free float, making the shares more valuable to the current shareholders. It’s a way of giving to the shareholders what they deserve.."
2021-05-19 14:25:52,wallstreetbets,"Companies buy back shares when they feel they are undervalued and the investment trumps other available options.

Maybe they don't need $4B in R&D.

2021-05-19 17:25:38,wallstreetbets,Get your shit stock out of here...
2021-05-19 16:37:14,wallstreetbets,"I believe the thinking behind it is:

-there is absolutely zero way for AMD to get more manufacturing capacity within the next two years. Every fab on the planet is pretty much maxed out. Companies and national governments are all investing hundreds of billions in new capacity, but that will take years to bear fruit.

-AMD will still sell every chip they make for 2 years, cashflow is no problem. 

-There is money you can spend on architecture R&D, like their cool chiplet shit. But AMD are already spending $1.5B there and that's already up 25% yoy, like how much more gasoline can you throw on that fire.

-AMD's stock has been losing value for absolute bullshit non-reasons and is at a buy-low point.

They are throwing cash into buybacks because they can't grow sales for any amount of money right now and their stock is legitimately undervalued. I would've looked into acquisitions with that $4B myself, but if you're low and tech is pretty high, I can see why you would bet on yourself.

Su Bae and co are smart and tend to be long-game players instead of 90 day Wall Street types. They've never bought back their own shares before. If they are starting now, they have my confidence as an AMD bagholder that it's for a good reason."

I was hoping HD also beating expectations and Lowe's margin improving, top line is still super high, taking market share from home depot, growing their pro line/contractors would jump it back up to where it was. And as a consumer, I prefer Lowes, some of their products are superior and their customer service is better. I think they'll hold onto this market share.

 I don't understand anything anymore. Unsubscribing from everything and back to VTI on auto-pilot."
2021-05-19 14:07:04,wallstreetbets,"Buy the rumor sell the news you fucking retard!

Everyone lost their shit when the market ended way up in 2020 mid-pandemic but somehow knew the crash in March should have happened because we had what 30 cases?  30 cases of Covid should make the fastest drop in history?  No, because the rumor was there was going to be millions of cases and shutdowns.

Lowes just had their Q1 earnings right?  Well guess what, the Revenue was only  26.7% above Q1 2020 revenue but the stock is 52% above where it was pre-pandemic.  Perhaps it was over-valued and didn't have the insane growth it showed during the last 2 quarters when the government was handing out free money and couldn't go outside.  They burned a ton of cash last quarter but still have more debt than they did a year ago.  It is almost as if EPS isn't the only metric you should use to value stock."

2 days before end of calls after earnings which should have propelled HD to $350.. it's trading at $315. the fuck.

They aren't just inching ahead of their competitor, they have made Intel, long-reigning king, into an absolute JOKE in every single market where they compete.  And they have gone blow-for-blow with nVidia in the GPU market.  The only negative I can see for AMD from an outsider non-tech-industry-understanding investor (which appears to be the majority of their shareholders, the idiots dumped the stock because earnings were shit a couple years ago... literally the day before everyone on the planet who has ever built a PC knew that the Ryzen line of chips was dropping the next day and was expected to be gods gift to computing (it was)) is that maybe they feel it's too good to be true.  Either that, or it's a bunch of butthurt MBAs getting revenge because MBAs ran AMD into the absolute dirt for DECADES, then a PhD engineer got in the chair (a move of desperation) and she showed that, of course, an engineer can master business in a weekend."

By the time people were telling mainstream media to shut the fuck up and stop fearmongering (the first response), anyone following actual scientists knew the genome ended in 33 'A' bases and that platforms were being used to synthesize the virus so that it could be supplied to the CDC for distribution to vaccine labs MONTHS before the first case hit US shores.  This is the age of the Internet, people.  If you are ignorant, it is BY CHOICE.  The information is THERE.  You can read Bioarxiv.  You can read PubMed.  No it's not spoon-fed for a general audience, but that's because general audiences are garbage.  Stop with that shit.  Read primary sources only.  Report of a new study?  Fucking skip the bullshit article and pull the study itself.  Find the podcasts the authors have been on.  Send them an email if you have a question.  You would be astounded how reachable scientists are if you step to them with a legitimate query and not some slack-jawed 'but why didnt I know watching CNBC all day that pandemic was gonna happen?

If the government pulled out of its support of American companies, half the Fortune 500 would disappear overnight.  No government contracts?  Shit, for many large companies the government is their largest customer.  For those that don't depend on it that directly, they depend on it gatekeeping for them, throwing up roadblocks so competitors can't horn in on what they're doing.  They rely on getting grandfathered in when regulations hit so that it only affects their competition.  During Clinton's time in the presidency, his advisors suggested that things like public land and mining rights should be auctioned off to the highest bidder.  Nope.  No administration would take him up on that.  They give the public goods away for pennies to cronies.  Any time you hear ""privatization"", don't think 'oh cool capitalism', think 'oh, old school communism' because that's what it is, with government giving cronies the keys to infrastructure and resources built with public taxpayer money either for free or for almost no cost.  It's flat out theft, and they make stupid poor idiots cheer for it.  And then when the blizzard comes to Texas and they're facing a $10k power bill, they cry little babies.  When a pandemic results in companies actually having to compete to hire service workers and it pushes wages up, holy SHIT do those ""pro-capitalist"" bitches WAIL!"

* No more courts to defend the IP rights?
* No more police to confiscate counterfeit goods?
* No more military to help defend freedom and international things like trade routes?

These companies do pay the same taxes, if not more than private citizens.  They pay not only property taxes upon the land they own, collect sales tax, pay one-half of the social security taxes, if they're profitable they'll pay income taxes and sales tax where applicable.

Often times, it's people who make poor choices such as choosing the electrical provider, the options or whether or not they allow privatization of power in TX.  But you also need to consider CA where PGE is under the Government, and they've not only burned entire towns to the ground, but are cutting power when it gets too windy.

Turn on the TV, see how long it takes before you can find someone whining about 'not being able to find workers'.  That's because the entirely capitalist idea that if demand spikes for something like service workers, while the supply remains static, the competition will force them to offer better pay, something they are not willing to do.  That's just capitalism though.  The business next door is offering minimum wage and chaotic, unpredictable scheduling.  Do you offer higher wages?  Maybe just a schedule you'll stick to that would enable your workers to get a second job so you can continue paying below a survivable wage?  Nah.  Go on TV and call everybody you want to come and make profit for you that they're shiftless pieces of shit."

2021-05-19 12:30:19,wallstreetbets,"I think the issue isn't that sticking together is a stupid play, it's that there will be a group of people who will inevitably NOT stick together. Those people will take profits at the expense of others so if you don't cash out when you can, you get left holding the bag. 

In short, everyone could make money working together, but greedy people could make MORE money at everyone elses expense. So everyone has to be greedy or you're ""a fool.""

Edit: if everyone hadn't ""worked together"" to raise the stock price this would have never happened. (To clarify I don't mean a coordinated effort here, I just mean that institutions and millions of investors raised the price because they bought in. One buyer would have done nothing)

If everyone had tried to cash out at $350 this wouldn't STILL be happening. 

If everyone tries to cash out when the price starts rising its going to end early. 

I get what you are saying, don't let someone say ""work together!"" While they fuck off with all the profit. But, in a way you are still wrong."

2021-05-19 13:42:06,wallstreetbets,"I don't think trading has to be inherently adversarial. 

However, some folks get really out of hand with abusing people to stay with their ""gang"" and hold through swings. The GME peak was crazy with people telling others that not holding was some kind of betrayal.

Even if you want to hang with your team in a trade, there's nothing wrong with taking your risk off the table. If you bought GME at $20, it would be stupid to not take all of your initial risk off the table when it hits $300. Then hold the rest and play with house money."

Biggest load of crap I have read today.   


The biggest global changes all happened because a few people started by doing things in a new way.   


People like you are a prohibitor against positive change, because of your silly argument: ""Well if I don't fu©k him over, he will fu©k me over"". <- No. Literally no. That only works if the guy is a big of an ashhole as you, otherwise you are just fu©king an innocent person over.

2021-05-19 13:11:27,wallstreetbets,"Had to look that up. I wouldnt consider myself a ""superrational"" person because I'm not assuming everyone is the same as me. Some people will cash out early, some people will hold to maximize their profits and sell a bit early, some will get lucky and hit the peak, some will wait too long and sell just after the peak, some will hold out and be the good guys CHOOSE to sell on the way down. Some people may short as the price starts to fall.

But I do try to think about game theory. There are those who are actively choosing to fuck people because they just want profit, there are those not thinking about it and just trying to maximize profits, and there are those who are trying to maximize EVERYONES profits. 

I'm just trying not to get fucked over, while making profits. Hoping institutions and whales don't cash out early, though I wager they will. They have the most to gain."

No, the goal isn't to avoid the madness of crowds, it's to follow the mad crowd as perfectly as possible.

2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$GC (GLD/IAU/GOLD) TA - Breaking a 10 Year Old Pattern - Lot's of Confluence - Weekly Close for Confirmation Been watching this Gold setup develop since last November. It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. 

[$GC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/dudwlorvi3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb931a041ddf4f5b79d58c008d4badcb8b91b7c2)

First - let's take a look at the **1 year 1 day** chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was **1853 -** and it needs to hold **1848** to stay intact. 

You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3.** 

Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, **the longer it takes to play out.** This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is **3-6 months** \- and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between.

Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. 

Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the **weekly close** for confirmation.

But - what makes this really interesting is the **10 year 1 week chart.**

[$GC 10 Year 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/ejdwc9xvj3071.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bdfbd8e014548cda17aaf6e754e28cd9abf651f)

Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. 

As a result - I'm targeting $GC **2250 - 2500** within the next **year.** Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the **monthly close** above that first breakout point.

And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify **key levels** to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step.

***TL;DR -*** 

$GC above 1853 weekly close targets **1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3**

$GC above 1853 monthly close targets **2250, 2500**

***Positions -***

$GLD **180**c for July @ **1.94** \- 

I plan to roll them back as time passes. I don't like to let my options get below 45 DTE"

2021-05-19 16:56:31,wallstreetbets,"I have $TRQ $AG $SIVR $SILJ $JNUG $CLF and $IAU calls for this commodity supercycle.

With BASEL III in June, and then all till Jan 2022,..  gold, silver, copper, steel, etc are all going to the MOON!

Hop on the commodity supercycle y’all, this breakout is legit and all metals will follow."
2021-05-19 15:39:37,wallstreetbets,"lmao gold price is determined by inflation expectations, your chart patterns are literally meaningless"
2021-05-19 16:42:30,wallstreetbets,"I've had a lot of success using only the charts. Usually technicals precede news.

Also - market has been pricing in inflation for QUITE A WHILE now and Gold has continued to go down. Clearly it's not that simple."
2021-05-19 15:55:20,wallstreetbets,So your saying that your not expecting inflation? Fed always fucks up when to pull back. Idk about you but my day to day expenses are up 25-50%. Even if the feds don’t fuck it up the consumers will. Especially with all these states pulling unemployment earlier than expected. That will cause a rush to accept any job resulting in lower consumer spending while we are still trying to unwind from COVID supply issues.
2021-05-19 16:48:49,wallstreetbets,"This is such a retarded statement its not even funny

Look up BASEL III

There is a legitimate catalyst happening in June & Jan 2022 whereby all gold paper derivatives will have to be replaced with Physical Gold for international banking / liquidity & de-leveraging purposes.  

This means big banks are buying massive amounts of gold, and this breakout currently supports that.

his chart is every bit of meaningful and the prediction is accurate.  Gold will SOAR this year."
2021-05-19 18:27:58,wallstreetbets,Why do you think TA will precede news and not the other way around?
2021-05-19 15:58:54,wallstreetbets,"no comment on my inflation expectations, my point was that he didn’t even acknowledge it"
2021-05-19 17:27:46,wallstreetbets,"that has literally nothing to do with the chart patterns retard lmao, he just happened to buy gold before it shot up, which by the way had nothing to do with basel."
2021-05-19 18:37:53,wallstreetbets,In my experience it almost always does
2021-05-19 17:29:02,wallstreetbets,"Can’t argue with stupid, how does the breakout have nothing to do with the catalyst causing it 🤣"
2021-05-19 19:50:18,wallstreetbets,"I mean, the reasoning, or do you not worry about the why and just accept it? You are not the first experienced TA person I've seen say this which means it's most definitely a thing."
2021-05-19 19:56:09,wallstreetbets,I can only assume market manipulation. I’ve thought about it a lot - but that’s the only thing at makes sense. Either that or technical patterns are just naturally occurring phenomena in any time series of data.

2021-05-19 16:22:50,wallstreetbets,"another tard yolo’d and bought max out a bought a bunch of calls at 15$,  you both cant win this can be fun to watch,   If you sell a NAKED call you do NOT cap your loses, do me a favor either close your position or buy some AMC calls at 30 or 35 to cap you lose potential, and convert to a spread.   I dont think you understand your loss potential is infinity NOT just 5 K like you think."
2021-05-19 14:05:32,wallstreetbets,That is a LOT of exposure for $3400. While I think you are safe anything can happen in the next month. How many times have you done this?
2021-05-19 12:46:35,wallstreetbets,This is pretty retarded. Good luck OP
2021-05-19 15:02:16,wallstreetbets,"I don't own AMC, but this is all the confirmation I need that AMC will reach $30"

2021-05-19 13:09:40,wallstreetbets,"Dude, the squeeze can happen after market, when your broker cannot close your options. The next day you will find yourself with a huge negative balance in the portfolio. The broker will try to sue you for that money, which can potentially be infinite."

This is gonna be epic one way or another"
2021-05-19 11:46:40,wallstreetbets,Are you not worried about that squeeze that I heard about from all these investing geniuses here who put their life savings of $1400 in AMC?
2021-05-19 13:02:49,wallstreetbets,Maxed margins = max profits.
2021-05-19 13:09:17,wallstreetbets,Take your profits

2021-05-19 19:02:41,wallstreetbets,AMC dropped 10% and you thought it was a good idea to sell calls you didn't cover? This is quite the play. Good luck and pray for no rebound.
2021-05-19 13:20:15,wallstreetbets,Lmao bruh now I hope this skyrockets past $40 just to blow up your account.
2021-05-19 13:36:25,wallstreetbets,I think you have this in the bag personally.

2021-05-19 14:09:09,wallstreetbets,"I wish my broker had approved me for this shit. Did a 0.42 credit spread yesterday on the 20/25c, which is printing big time also. My short leg was sold at 1.71. It is at 0.94 now. Feels good, but also bad, because I would have made a shitload of money on the naked calls."

2021-05-19 17:09:23,wallstreetbets,That $16 one is insanity especially when its 1/2 of your portfolio

2021-05-19 19:35:55,wallstreetbets,"Great strategy but why did you use to such long expiry dates?  Most of the IV could be captured by selling the weeklys and you could keep rolling it over.  

For anyone thinking that hedge funds will be caught off guard again on this type of short squeeze,  life will not be kind to you.  They have already secured the lending, the market makers, the SEC regulators, the DTCC and any other unscrupulous miscreant politicians to ensure this doesn't become a problem.   It was nice while it lasted but let's not quit our day job.  Back to Mickey D's and 4:20 for me."
2021-05-19 12:12:39,wallstreetbets,Looks like your going to lose alot of money lol. Whether u guys believe it or not the amc squeeze is real and anyone calling it otherwise hasnt really done there homework. Either way good luck and yes i am a amc ape.
2021-05-19 11:58:22,wallstreetbets,brilliant... except when it squeezes to 100k /s
2021-05-19 12:43:44,wallstreetbets,Seems scummy. Watch out for marge
2021-05-19 11:57:44,wallstreetbets,"I did a naked call with amc to my wife’s boyfriend it just wasn’t the kind of naked call you’re talking about and whatever show was on was teh sux. I think it was lodge 49.

I guess what I’m getting at is naked calls are never a good idea when wives are involved."
2021-05-19 12:14:55,wallstreetbets,Fake AF news
2021-05-19 11:57:13,wallstreetbets,"Well done! Sell high, buy low. Plenty of ways to make monae without committing to that fake hype. The bagholders should realize selling calls is better than watching paint dry."

2021-05-19 12:37:21,wallstreetbets,You mean the ones saying AMC will be $1400/share during the squeeze and it's going to happen... Never can remember when they say it's gunna happen... Seems like they can never make up their mind on that part!

2021-05-19 11:50:37,wallstreetbets,Do you not believe it will happen?
2021-05-19 16:08:31,wallstreetbets,There was a mini squeeze last thursday so some pressure has already been released. There is little risk for a short squeeze in AMC right now.
2021-05-19 14:03:14,wallstreetbets,These positions are dumb but so is assuming the squeeze is 100% going to happen.
2021-05-19 14:12:22,wallstreetbets,How high do you think it can go??? And by what date It'll start going down again??? I mean just wanna see your opinion bro...
2021-05-19 12:12:23,wallstreetbets,That’s impossible 🤣
2021-05-19 12:09:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah but not naked calls. That’s infinite exposure and dumb whether or not you think AMC will squeeze.
2021-05-19 12:09:39,wallstreetbets,It ain't much but it's honest work
2021-05-19 13:04:08,wallstreetbets,If AMC drops why would he get rid of the calls he sold?

2021-05-19 13:08:52,wallstreetbets,GME margin. Hw did you screw those. Above 350..

2021-05-19 16:29:56,wallstreetbets,Why? They could just buy the calls back and take the profit
2021-05-19 16:57:32,wallstreetbets,Huh?
2021-05-19 16:38:49,wallstreetbets,"Not like they put your name on the record and can come after whatever you have and will have.

2021-05-19 13:21:00,wallstreetbets,The problem is they need to divide by 100 and there is the squeeze
2021-05-19 14:24:28,wallstreetbets,"There will be a squeeze.  Wont go to 100k like the people in amc subs believe thou lol, I'll be happy if it goes above 100-500."

2021-05-19 17:58:59,wallstreetbets,$20 would not be a squeeze. This is extra retarded OP.
2021-05-19 14:14:03,wallstreetbets,ahaha
2021-05-19 18:37:30,wallstreetbets,You have no idea what the fuck you are doing. Go back to trading equity.
2021-05-19 14:09:35,wallstreetbets,Please can you explain that to me good friend?
2021-05-19 11:57:41,wallstreetbets,Idk it’s been talk of this squeeze since March and how the run to 25 wasn’t the real squeeze. That said I actually kinda like amc cause I don’t think movie theaters are over especially with lots of straight to streaming movies flopping
2021-05-19 14:07:26,wallstreetbets,"Its inevitable. You cant short amc into ground when you have 80 percent of float held by retail traders. No doubt it will run, maybe not to the 100k-500k floor as many would suggest but 100-300 is extremely likely and i say this because human emotion will overtake most retail traders and institutions to sell for profits which is why i cant see such high ceilings."
2021-05-19 14:28:03,wallstreetbets,"I cannot give you a date bro as the hedge funds, are using suspect tactics to kick can down the road, they are trying to prolong this buy borrowing shares to short and liquidating to accumulate capital to keep up this fight. What we really need is a surge of buyers to overcome this and we are getting that day by day hence 8 straight green days. These tactics are used to encourage selling from paper hands, its just a matter of time really and how long can these guys bleed millions. Shorts are paying daily while we holders pay nothing to hold."
2021-05-19 14:25:42,wallstreetbets,Dont know why you got downvoted lol. AMC or gme reaching 100k is just dumb ha
2021-05-19 13:06:29,wallstreetbets,There is mistake. No fake share of AMC. Sell before 2 June. Price be $1 very soon.
2021-05-19 18:39:41,wallstreetbets,Okay so you pretty much have to wait till expiration?

2021-05-19 14:01:15,wallstreetbets,I'm ready to get back to normal: going to movies is that normal.  There's a reason they postponed 007.... some movies are just better on the big screen.
2021-05-19 15:51:17,wallstreetbets,That's my take.  I dont think AMC is going anywhere.   If it dives I'll sit on it while it slowly recovers over the next year or two.  I didn't put in money that I would need to make my mortgage next month
2021-05-19 12:53:44,wallstreetbets,I mean the stocks had straight green week and went from 9 to peak 16 idk why no one would not wanna join that. Look up all the data and amount of shorting its all there for people to find. Anyways Micheal burry is retarded for shorting tesla off topic
2021-05-19 18:39:03,wallstreetbets,"The fact you're talking about ""maybe not"" a $100k floor shows just how retarded expectations are for AMC."
2021-05-19 14:11:35,wallstreetbets,"You absolutely can short when 80% is retail. Mainly because of the last line you listed. People will get shaken out QUICK. Look how many ""apes"" are freaking out after 1 down day in 9. Image this drifts back down to 9 or 10. It will be mass panic.

For what it is worth, the climb to $20 earlier this year and $15 now is impressive considering the fundamentals don't warrant anything close (in my opinion based on its history and debt requirements)."
2021-05-19 15:38:52,wallstreetbets,"Theres fees associated with shorting a stock, borrow fees and interest fees. Your also on a margin account and must have liquidity in the account to cover when you short a stock. Im going to take a guess that the short sellers shorted amc around 8, 12, 14 dollars, those seem to be the numbers borrowed shares that were shorted really were at its highest i could be wrong but just looking at charts on how hard they fought to keep price points at certain levels which tells me $15 bucks is a huge deal and would incur massive losses and margin calls kick in and the start of covering."
2021-05-19 15:42:52,wallstreetbets,"And when the sharr sky rockets?
I mean, what does it need to happen for the price to go really high."

2021-05-19 18:40:50,wallstreetbets,"You get your premium right away. But yes, you wouldn’t find out if you lost/made money until expiration"
2021-05-19 18:47:50,wallstreetbets,You can close them early like any other option. If it drops say 50% in a day it makes sense to buy-to-close the call than wait until expiration.

2021-05-19 15:46:39,wallstreetbets,It freaking squeezed up last week to 14/share.
2021-05-19 15:53:34,wallstreetbets,I'm still waiting on A Quiet Place 2.  They didn't sit inbthar movie for over a year because theaters don't make them more money then straight to streaming
2021-05-19 13:00:40,wallstreetbets,Personally I try not to buy stocks that have already gone near 100% in a week.  I sold 300 shares of AMC last Wednesday so what the fuck do I know?
2021-05-19 18:42:50,wallstreetbets,Relax bro seems like your angry about something? Its all speculation from data and like everything else in here.
2021-05-19 14:19:44,wallstreetbets,"Fundamentals? We all kno this isnt about fundamentals at the moment, the data and new rules getting put in place from the sec (mind you they are not really enforcing anything) should be enough along with sentiment for the stock to warrant a run. Im not going to go on about data as theres so much out there to read and verify, you mention paper hands bowing out sure theres always going to be paper hands just like there was for GME and GME float is considerably smaller and yet gme has had two mini runs. Amc is set up to explode like it or not and i feel alot of gme holders are mad at the fact that took some fuel away from GME."
2021-05-19 14:22:16,wallstreetbets,"If you want to discuss fundamentals amc is easily recovered from the pandemic and have enough liquidity to float them to the 2022 on top of movie theaters opening up nationwide. You must give credit to the management team lead by the silverback, they have completely changed the outlook of amc as a company and on paper amc looks promising."
2021-05-19 16:11:56,wallstreetbets,"I’m new to this and had enough money to throw away and got myself 115 shares.

So far from what I understand, holding is the most important thing here, the longer people hold the more money everyone makes.

However, I don’t see everyone just jumping ship if this thing reaches $50,$100 or even $300 that quickly 

I could see people holding onto dear life for $1000 since today pretty much showed that no one budged."
2021-05-19 13:47:18,wallstreetbets,"I tell you truth. Amc will never be $10k, or $100k or $500k. It will never be anywhere near it. This is the real truth and you all know it."
2021-05-19 18:51:38,wallstreetbets,I'm laughing so fucking hard at this
2021-05-19 19:57:11,wallstreetbets,Hey that last hour of the market is a good time for making plays lol
2021-05-19 19:59:28,wallstreetbets,\*laughing my ass off from the future\*
2021-05-19 14:24:07,wallstreetbets,"My point about fundamentals is that this stock should be MUCH lower so there is already a substantial squeeze.

AMC ran with GME the first time and now GME is running with AMC now. I don't see this getting above 20 not matter how much ""data"" there is to support it. But, I was surprised it ran this high though so take that for what it is worth.

There are soooo many people involved in this movement that have zero knowledge about the stock market. Those will be shaken out by this weekend if AMC stays around $12. The ride ends before it even starts.

I wish we had someone with actual knowledge that could explain what is happening with the hedge funds. They don't have the same brokers/rules as retail. Are they really paying these prices? Do they really have a chance to get margin called? All points I would like to see instead we get ""MOON!!!"""
2021-05-19 14:28:20,wallstreetbets,"Surviving isn't the same as succeeding. They were failing before the pandemic.

I can't stand the management team. As the saying goes, they were born on 3rd base with this squeeze and thinks they hit a triple. Honestly, name 1 thing they have done? Sold shares at these high prices? That has very little too do with making AMC a better company. He gave himself a pretty nice bonus for doing nothing earlier this year.

I get why people love him now because he is great for the squeeze. Once it is over it is back to running the place into the ground."
2021-05-19 16:16:27,wallstreetbets,"We disagree on that. I think people are dumping at $20. If it gets to $40 I think that is the top and enough people will sell and end it. You have to think, there are whale HFs out there on the positive side that will sell pretty early. They can't risk missing out. HFs just need to beat the market.

I don't know all the psychological research but I would assume a couple of these dumps will shake quite a few out."
2021-05-19 17:02:37,wallstreetbets,Still... Neither original nor entertaining. As I wrote: you're not even trying. Bad troll!
2021-05-19 14:36:06,wallstreetbets,"Listen i get where you are coming from but i know enough that this stock is severely undervalued, ur right this stock as it currently stands is a $20 stock but again fundamentals out the picture we are fighting short sellers and the massive shorting done to amc. Nobody can say for certainty that these hedge funds follow different rules etc as we all see with our own eyes theres something going on. I dont even want to talk about these ghost shares that are real or not, that info will reveal itself when the share recount happens and even then thats if management wants to release those numbers. My bet they will release those numbers because its in there best interest to do so. Look at it like this why have a share recount? Why take off 500 million share dilution? Why release 43 million shares in market at market value in such a way that didnt affect price? Adam aron isnt a dumb ceo and he is all about making money for amc no matter what it takes, he see exactly what us retail traders see a very good possibility amc stock shoots way past $20. Thats not even including the fact of a short squeeze."
2021-05-19 14:44:35,wallstreetbets,"I love debates like this because its healthy to have various opinions on same topics, so im glad u have your doubts as most people should when investing but we have here with amc is a winning hand no matter how u look at it we win this war. Im all about common sense and trends and everything is pointing towards a big run squeeze or not, just watch the last week of trading for amc. 14.50 is extremely tough wall to blast n hold because we all know that if we blast through that wall and hold hedge funds will have to start covering due to the fact fomo takes into effect and thats all we really need atm, thats why they are doing everything possible to knock us down everytime we touch that wall. Look at the charts they are fighting us hard there for a reason."
2021-05-19 14:38:45,wallstreetbets,Bro they made over 1 billion in cash reserves when most of there theaters is closed!! Like u tell me what management team can do that? We retailers helped save amc from going under because had we not bought up the shares amc would have been bankrupt and thats a fact.
2021-05-19 16:20:08,wallstreetbets,"Oh for sure, I personally think this whole “100k is the floor” is an attempt to condition people to hold.

$40 at $13 a share and 100 shares is still money in the bank that I didn’t have before. 

But I’m gonna double my investment at the minimum and play with house money after that. I’m holding until it’s the bitter end. What do I have to lose at that point ?"
2021-05-19 14:40:48,wallstreetbets,We can agree to disagree on the CEO. I am not impressed but I could easily be wrong. Time will tell.
2021-05-19 14:53:01,wallstreetbets,"I do wish that I knew more about the HF's deals. Do they really have to cover at 14? Or 15 or 20? Or, are they already screwed and will blow up at 12? I feel like we should have seen more with the last 8 days running from 9 to 15. That HAD to have killed some funds. Maybe they get grace periods? Maybe they owe the brokers so much that it is in their best interest to ride this out?

I wish there was something I could read that would cover a ""black swan"" scenario like a short going hard against them."
2021-05-19 17:19:09,wallstreetbets,Mark my words. You will lose all of your money you moron
2021-05-19 14:50:06,wallstreetbets,"""We retailers helped save amc"" is 100% true. WE did. The CEO just got in front at the end and people are praising him for doing the only smart thing. AMC will forever be indebted to the people holding the stock and I hope they keep that in mind going forward. AMC wouldn't exist without the holders this spring.

I am taking numbers from MarketWatch:

Over the last 3 years (2017/18/19) the company costs about $4b each year to run (COGS). So, from the start, that is the bare minimum they need to handle each year. During those years they have been clearing over $5b which is good but they only made money once.

Now, what is very relevant (and might have changed) is that as of 2020 they have 616m in short term debt. They also have almost $800m in other liabilities. That puts them at 1.93b in total current liabilities. Next, their long term debt is almost $10b. When you look at the balance sheet they have $12b in total liabilities BEFORE COVID.

With all of these numbers, I am not certain what they have done recently. I have heard they refi'ed some stuff and put some of the recently raised money towards debt. But, I couldn't find anything to see what they have done. If it was a clear cut win I would think there would be some PR from AMC setting out how they are going to handle the debt.

I am not in AMC any more and I do wish you all the luck. I would like to see this turn into a blow up of the hedge funds and their lackeys in the SEC."
2021-05-19 18:06:42,wallstreetbets,AMC has a price target of around 5 dollars. There is literally no way in hell you wont lose most of your money if you bought now at an all time high
2021-05-19 14:46:01,wallstreetbets,"I get it bro and I appreciate your honesty, right now all we have is time and it cost us apes nothing. I just cant say the same about short sellers shorting amc 😉"

2021-05-19 14:58:00,wallstreetbets,"Well not all theaters are up and running saving the company money and the numbers your looking at is full staffed theaters that is running. Not even half are open for business yet because covid restrictions but those are starting to relax a bit in certain states of course. This why earnings report last month was important and it was more than promising. Wait for the numbers when the country is full up and running to render judgement, but for now they have enough money to float what is currently open with a great plan to bring in revenue."
2021-05-19 18:11:17,wallstreetbets,"Where are you getting your $5 price target from? Yahoo? 

No one is factoring in the inflated float and synthetic shares.

You really think people are going to lose money at this point? lol show me your portfolio then we'll talk."
2021-05-19 14:53:56,wallstreetbets,"I have said in another comment that I wish I knew more about HFs shorting. What they pay, what they have for collateral, etc. We saw with that guy that blew $900m on tech stocks that clearly some of them don't have rules."
2021-05-19 15:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Very true. I haven't dug deep into what those numbers actually mean and how much it costs when everything was shutdown. Rent vs salary vs movie costs, etc.

I was actually bullish when I saw how bad ww84 was and how pretty much every major contract us written with the expectation of going to theaters. I think every massive film will still be going up theaters. I also assumed we would have at least a year of people going to movies a lot more than normal because they missed it."
2021-05-19 18:43:17,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean “people are going to lose money”? Well, if you are invested in AMC... obviously 😂 90% of traders lose money in the long run, and many more in subs such as WSB (I’d say close to 95%), so I really don’t understand your question lol"

As i stated that management team deserve praise because they spent the cash wisely and actually help save the company. We not including all the big movies getting released this summer and with home fatigue everyone has from being couped up amc is looking extremely bullish imo."
2021-05-19 18:48:48,wallstreetbets,"Where are you getting your numbers from exactly? What are your sources other than ""trust me"" ??

You're saying that everyone so far is set to lose money on AMC, go ahead and show me how. Give me some actual statistics and proven data to back it up. I'm a little over $1,000 in and over 100 shares at this point. 

Show me how I'm set to LOSE money, I'd love to hear this."
2021-05-19 15:16:22,wallstreetbets,I need to sit down and figure out what I think AMC is worth. I was in the $8/9 range in Feb/March but that was before any of the 43m shares got sold. Dilution is normally bad but it does appear that AMC shareholders are money ahead by doing it.
2021-05-19 15:18:20,wallstreetbets,"It wouldnt be a bad idea bro, im not gunna tell u to invest in amc but what i am gunna tell you is to do your DD and come to ur own decision, at the end pf the day you will kno if its a play worth looking at or not."
2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"As per your request for Markov Regime Switching models with SPY & QQQ See original post for initial description. This uses all historical adjusted close prices available on yahoo using weekly prices. Also I didn't realize how long this post is but its mostly graphs.

**SPY Results:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvhxo3dnl1071.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=546d9684c02c4da0a25f4887c727d8c893c3224b

First thing I notice is that periods of high variance returns are not sustained and they look possibly isolated, although there minor spikes before each big one.

https://preview.redd.it/ln6677wul1071.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72c82557c3045a9575d857189931a84a693c24

On the other hand it looks like medium variance and low variance are in a constant switch off. We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium.

https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928

Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. 

https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153

This shows that high variance returns are more like *surprises* in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.  

**QQQ results**

QQQ’s results are very similar to SPY’s results. 

https://preview.redd.it/bqavsxmam1071.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad8be59558f24274d2ac689fa83e8c7a629de55

It seems like there are not *precursor* spikes in high variance returns, and the occur in isolation.  In this case it does seem like there is a sustained period of high variance returns in the early 2000s.  

https://preview.redd.it/gp4sc5yem1071.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=73c238b2a8657a2ada87e458ebc27140654a352f

The same cyclical inverse pattern occurs within the low and medium level regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/qqkq714km1071.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=899816666e35168b5e1756ee58dba86013739f5c

And consistent with SPY it seems like high variance regime spikes come from low variance to high variance.

https://preview.redd.it/cb5o3v2om1071.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89f554112e2b8dd2d79904a6aa6249b3326a31a

**Conclusions / Future areas to investigate**

· In CBOE VIX data is was common for large spikes in high variance to come from medium variance regimes, that does not seem to be the case for SPY or QQQ most of the high variance spikes come from changes from low variance to high variance

· Both QQQ and SPY exhibited what look like to be an inverse relationship between low and medium variance regimes. Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a *shift* that is probably a *break* in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance

· QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

 I hope to turn the codebase into a python-only repo so I can analyze the time series in a notebook a publish more of my findings.

2021-05-19 11:31:26,wallstreetbets,It looks like you can find *breaks* in low to medium variances which usually mean signs of high variance. A *break* in this sense means the security will have more volatility.

2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Honestly what’s wrong with $GE? Larry Culp is turning its management around. Lowering debt, improving cash flow and earnings, and simplifying the company. GE is also in government contracts and will receive a decent portion of the infrastructure bill. Airline demand is through the rough and maintenance contracts on frames that have been collecting dust are still there not to mention the 737 MAX is now flying again with increased demand from airlines. GE has been named the provider of the turbines for the worlds largest wind farm off of the shore of northern England and will continue to be a player in green energy and healthcare. 
Sure it’s been mismanaged for decades, but it’s turning around. Why do people hate it like the plague?

Edit: Short interest is increasing drastically up to almost 20% so there is big money riding this down."
2021-05-19 11:08:46,wallstreetbets,Market is garbage right now. The only way to make money is shorting companies to oblivion.  Wendy’s is hiring
2021-05-19 11:30:52,wallstreetbets,"GE is a pile of dogshit. It hasn’t just been mismanaged. Especially in Energy, they’ll be dragged down by decisions execs made ages ago over the coming years. They also have a dogshit reputation among engineers now and it’s almost impossible for them to recruit top talent like they used to. When a company is managed this poorly they usually lose all of their good middle managers who saw what was happening…And they generally keep all of their shitty people."
2021-05-19 13:03:01,wallstreetbets,"I rode GE from 6$ to 12$ and got out. Would not want to own it long term. Management has been creative with accounting. Nobody knows what bodies will be dug up in the future. And the announce reverse split does not inspire confidence.

Also, Dow is taking a dive and the reflation trade is losing steam."
2021-05-19 11:24:37,wallstreetbets,"It's still mismanaged. There are so many corporate arms of the company that the best efforts of any CEO can only dig down so many layers before the effect is completely lost on middle management types who treat their job as one giant political campaign. They will make up pointless work just to show they are busy as a justification to get the biggest budgets year in and year out. I see this exact scenario play out first hand with 3 different GE divisions that work with the company that signs my paychecks.

2021-05-19 17:10:07,wallstreetbets,Culp is shedding garbage. It will take time to bring GE into the 21st century but it will get there. They make very important products but got greedy and tried to sell shit that had nothing to do with their core reason for existing. I do fear more accounting fiascos in the future. General public needs to see cool new green tech with their logo on the side of it. That should be a catalyst.

2021-05-19 11:05:05,wallstreetbets,I’m sitting on 860 6/11 $13.5 calls. So I know the pain. I think it’s just a bloated market. But GE doesn’t reap the same gains during Green Day’s but gets all the losses on red days.
2021-05-19 11:08:26,wallstreetbets,Would leap calls be something to look into? Or too much uncertainty

It has a ton going against it. I'd be fine holding stock in a long term retirement account at the current prices, but I'm a bit worried about your options."
2021-05-19 11:34:12,wallstreetbets,They are a big govt contractor. So possibly why.
2021-05-19 11:19:11,wallstreetbets,It means buying a company not directly related to what you are betting on. Buying GE or ABB will see significant growth because of solar or wind expansion but most people will be looking and betting on a solar or wind company not noticing that a lot of the parts those companies are using are actually coming from GE and ABB which will both see steady growth regardless of what solar or wind company comes out on top

2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Weird DD, about space and aliens and how it will affect space stocks. So the US government is supposed to release government files related to UFOs otherwise known as UAP in June 25. Now to some of you it may not be a big deal but the public may feel different about that. You see, these reports we’ve seen that the government has been releasing “confirming” is just the tip of the iceberg. Now you may not believe aliens are real and that’s fine that you’re that ignorant. We don’t judge. However, the US has been conducting recon missions observing these aerial phenomenons. They know they exist. They know they are here. They do not know their intentions or capabilities. Which is scary to think. 

So how does this relate to stonks? How do you deal with a possible threat that has way better technology than you? You build and invest in better aerospace defensive technology. “Space Defense stocks” more or so space stocks “Trimble, Boeing, Lockheed, or even ETF stocks like ARKX” and others i can’t name off the top of my head. The point is, the public will feel as if we are vulnerable and in doing so the country will pour billions into aerospace defense and technology.

Now I added a link to some compelling information. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ufo-military-intelligence-60-minutes-2021-05-16/#app

Another note. There’s a name to one of the spaceships named “Tic Tac” which is known to travel at 35,000 mph and can travel through air and water. Google tic tac."

That probably would have a negative affect because people aren’t really going to value currency the same if we realize we have been lied to for dummy long and we could of had peace or relationships with these being that obviously harness free unlimited energy which we basically slave away for. OR what could happen is they come out and say this isnt aliens. We discovered materials and technology that lead to the development of advanced spacecrafts and technology. I think this would have a positive impact because people are going to go all in on the USA because we have made leaps in tech that break our understanding of current physics. However you still have that possibility of them harnessing some type of unlimited energy source. 
What do I think? I think that these beings are definitely aliens and that our government might know a little or be in some type of contact with them. But have no control over them and are probably scared as fuck of them. Possibly so scared that they dont want to tell us the whole truth. Imagine if you were elected president and they said aye there’s aliens and they want to destroy us and take our planet."

2. Release info that is already widely available with some speculative analysis and commentary based on ""what we know so far""
3. Release completely fabricated info
4. Not release any info finding a legitimate way/loophole to prolong withholding

Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it’s a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle’s tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle’s opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

The $3m in buybacks seems like it should play a relevant part in the analysis? They wouldn't entirely negate the downward stress of 9-10, but they'd mitigate it by some amount, surely? Or are you discounting them entirely because they may just stop buying at 9 and wait for the price to drop to 7 or 8?"
2021-05-19 12:20:36,wallstreetbets,Its a clear trend reversal. Look at the institutional activity and do some dd for your own decisions. I have felt its a strong div and upside in a market that is looking for reasons to go red.

On top of fees out the ass when it's back up and running it doesn't matter they're not going to sell you coins at the low low price you see on their site. They'll buy, sell, convert your coins at whatever shady prices that will get them a little more money off the top."

2021-05-19 14:39:40,wallstreetbets,Anyone from Canada? Did Netcoins had any problems?
2021-05-19 14:47:44,wallstreetbets,And just about every stonk im holding too

2021-05-19 15:26:00,wallstreetbets,COIN is a good company and an utter trash stock. I pity the fools who bought this shit. I bought COIN puts two weeks ago. That moat lmao
2021-05-19 15:27:47,wallstreetbets,It’s a centralized exchange for decentralized assets.
2021-05-19 15:37:49,wallstreetbets,Wouldnt selling off actually be good for coinbase....selling or buying is a transaction and for each transaction coinbase makes money does it not?
2021-05-19 16:01:00,wallstreetbets,"Coinbase makes money on trades regardless of price, so volatility is amazing for their businesses. This shows that their system is getting so hammered it’s having difficulty keeping up with demand. 

That is a good problem to have."
2021-05-19 16:12:12,wallstreetbets,"Sad thing is most retail traders (who aren't on reddit) are too ignorant or lazy to set up shop with a real provider. So it really doesn't matter. Just like with robinhood. ""Yeah but I like how it looks"" Yeah, you're an idiot."
2021-05-19 16:27:53,wallstreetbets,"Even though we may have never met or seen each others smiles 

You truly have amazingly beautiful eyes that I haven’t seen 

that lights the night sky as the lighthouse out at sea  

I will be the light in the storm for you 

as the high seas batter upon rocky cliffs 

Shear winds rip through the hillsides upon the shore 

It’s hard to see the lighthouse out at sea through the night 

I will be here to see when the sun comes out on the sea

2021-05-19 16:29:46,wallstreetbets,I think Coin is overrated - it’s a matter of time before fees are gone from buying and selling coins.
2021-05-19 16:30:06,wallstreetbets,I had to bail on coin. Couldn’t keep taking gut shots w week after week of red
2021-05-19 16:34:17,wallstreetbets,You would think in the era of cloud computing this shit would not be an issue.... hmmm
2021-05-19 16:35:57,wallstreetbets,Just cheap servers that cannot handle the load during high volume times.
2021-05-19 16:43:45,wallstreetbets,"Funny, people crap on Robinhood but I actually had no problem at all buying the dip using their app :-)"
2021-05-19 16:48:37,wallstreetbets,Dow Jones stopes a share with big swings. How is that not the same even if one is not on purpose
2021-05-19 16:52:20,wallstreetbets,some say they don't have problems and here I am that has coin before the dip and I do but it's not a conspiracy. Sure it isn't.
2021-05-19 17:07:40,wallstreetbets,this is simple. exchanges r down for maintenance when the price takes a shit so u cant buy the dips.. need to have buy orders
2021-05-19 17:12:28,wallstreetbets,🐠 👃🏻
2021-05-19 17:26:49,wallstreetbets,I can’t even send ETH anywhere right now from coinbase smh 🤦🏻‍♂️

2021-05-19 17:39:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I was trading on Coinbase before I realized there even was a Pro version. And it's free and trades are a fraction of the cost. I think they don't advertise this for a reason....so lots of people keep overpaying on Coinbase regular.

I also use BitMart and had no issues with it crashing either. Though I also wasn't buying at the extreme dip....sadly I missed that window 😥"
2021-05-19 17:52:08,wallstreetbets,It's like robinhood 2.0
2021-05-19 17:53:09,wallstreetbets,Too centralizedddd
2021-05-19 17:58:07,wallstreetbets,"Centralized exchanges are problematic in periods of high volatility. You here anyone talking about Uniswap being down today? 

The fees were high sure because everyone was panicking and competing for processing power, but you could get a trade done if you wanted to pay the fee.

Pick your poison- having the freedom to trade revoked at any time or paying higher fees to trade whenever you please."
2021-05-19 18:01:22,wallstreetbets,"Hey, i’ve seen this one before."
2021-05-19 18:28:32,wallstreetbets,Ooooffff

2021-05-19 18:44:11,wallstreetbets,What is a could app to use to invest yourself. EXCEPT Robinhood..that's been a headache. They keep saying I already have an account. Any suggestions?!
2021-05-19 18:46:10,wallstreetbets,Coinbase is incredibly slow and always seems like it's about to freeze!
2021-05-19 18:54:28,wallstreetbets,Can’t make it to heaven w/o going through hell man .. Check $GME ... Whips up! 200 C’s closing ITM tomorrow.

2021-05-19 19:51:52,wallstreetbets,Puts on coin!
2021-05-19 13:03:51,wallstreetbets,Voyager does the same thing. Does any exchange available in the US not have these issues?
2021-05-19 12:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Remember when that happened to GME and the cryptø people were laughing at the gametards saying ""that's why you trade decentralised stuff""?  lmao"
2021-05-19 13:32:23,wallstreetbets,But they make bank from the volatility though.
2021-05-19 14:37:00,wallstreetbets,Was Netcoins working?
2021-05-19 15:40:16,wallstreetbets,NiceHash is no withdraw.
2021-05-19 10:36:37,wallstreetbets,"You could always set limit orders in ahead of time, but yeah I agree that’s beside the point. The system should still work during high volatility."
2021-05-19 12:37:00,wallstreetbets,"sounds like Robinhood. maybe more robbing though, since it's both sides"
2021-05-19 13:12:19,wallstreetbets,What's funny is that this is not new. I've been using Coinbase since 2017 and crashes like this used to be routine. You used to be able to line up practically every big dip with a Coinbase outage. It's actually gotten a *lot* better over the last few years.
2021-05-19 12:21:42,wallstreetbets,It’s literally poor infrastructure on coins part. Same with other exchanges in that space we must not talk about. All have the same problems at the same time usually
2021-05-19 15:08:31,wallstreetbets,I can buy in webull
2021-05-19 13:13:55,wallstreetbets,I didn't have any issues? I didn't know others had been
2021-05-19 14:02:23,wallstreetbets,Don't use coinbase. Keep a independent wallet with your coins separate. It's simple. Hit me up if you need help
2021-05-19 18:16:19,wallstreetbets,Can confirm Revolut was also having issues out of  the sudden.
2021-05-19 18:30:41,wallstreetbets,Yes this is a giant conspiracy to take you down
2021-05-19 10:56:25,wallstreetbets,No it’s not rigged against you. Maybe you should post in r/conspiracy to make yourself feel better
2021-05-19 11:09:25,wallstreetbets,"The CEO, Armstrong probably pocketed all the money for his nanomachine research."
2021-05-19 10:51:09,wallstreetbets,Apparently they didn't get additional paid in capital from the IPO since it was a direct listing. They did however recently raise $1.2 billion in new debt.
2021-05-19 11:35:34,wallstreetbets,"All of the money they got from direct listing was current shareholders selling their shares, so all of the money went to the owners cashing out, and none to the actual company."
2021-05-19 11:49:08,wallstreetbets,Spoken like a person who doesnt really know about IT or servers...
2021-05-19 13:49:36,wallstreetbets,Didn't they just agree to issue > a billion dollars of convertible debt too?
2021-05-19 10:53:37,wallstreetbets,I haven't had any wallet withdrawal issues with it but the volatility and platforms go down is something that I would of thought long ago would be fixed. Unless they are benefiting from buying the low and selling to the public.
2021-05-19 10:07:45,wallstreetbets,how often does it happen
2021-05-19 10:28:14,wallstreetbets,Why not use a decentralized platform like uni?
2021-05-19 15:55:21,wallstreetbets,When was Fidelity down? I never lost access
2021-05-19 10:46:15,wallstreetbets,She let Jesus take the wheel
2021-05-19 11:19:28,wallstreetbets,She just bought more yesterday
2021-05-19 11:12:58,wallstreetbets,"You do realize she ""listens to god"" to get her investment choices?

I should remind you, it's called Ark because it's named after the ark of the covenant from the bible. (you know, the magic box that destroys armies?)

If you're looking for someone who makes sound decisions based on reason and logic, the hyper religious ""true believer"" lady aint it.

She believes in literal magic."
2021-05-19 10:47:27,wallstreetbets,I know right. Even just from a 'new issue' lull stand point it was illogical.
2021-05-19 12:41:06,wallstreetbets,ARK owns 10% of the stock
2021-05-19 19:10:15,wallstreetbets,They didn't get any IPO money. It was a direct listing.
2021-05-19 13:19:58,wallstreetbets,"no idea why, but they don't provide that feature"
2021-05-19 15:29:38,wallstreetbets,I was excited and downloaded the app yesterday and it’s just a mess. Tons of core features not there unless you go Pro and it’s just not intuitive
2021-05-19 10:51:46,wallstreetbets,Yeah every time I experience this it is on their web platforms but they all run on the same backend.
2021-05-19 16:29:08,wallstreetbets,A shit company with a shit app that charges exorbitant fees
2021-05-19 10:43:40,wallstreetbets,Its exactly what robinhood does.
2021-05-19 10:32:08,wallstreetbets,I've never had an issue with the app. What have been the big problems?
2021-05-19 11:38:12,wallstreetbets,Whats the alternative?
2021-05-19 12:34:55,wallstreetbets,"I assume they have it in their pipeline to upgrade their servers. The ease of access, security, and the fact it is a household name in the U.S. will keep it a top contender for some time. There are definitely better options out there, but there are countless nefarious ones as well."
2021-05-19 16:00:41,wallstreetbets,"This is what all of the people here said when Robinhood literally fucked their gfs in front of them, yet 90% of this subreddit uses them still... So I doubt it."

2021-05-19 10:43:56,wallstreetbets,Market moves like this create an effective DDoS on exchanges. Gemini was also having issues.

2021-05-19 11:34:45,wallstreetbets,"""Robin your coin."""
2021-05-19 15:31:31,wallstreetbets,Exactly. It’s hard to tell how much value you have of each coin and what the movement is like. Good thing there’s a big banner that tells you the % change today across ALL coins. Cause that info is more useful than my portfolio for sure..
2021-05-19 16:42:40,wallstreetbets,Coinbase you own the coin (or a % thereof). RH you don’t own any of it just speculate. Soooo Rh isn’t as good as you making it out.
2021-05-19 13:21:05,wallstreetbets,"right, like this is the first time it's happened. it literally happens every time there is >15% movement"
2021-05-19 16:48:05,wallstreetbets,No RH did not work fine.  RH froze up all day.  Damn I think people from rh post here. Like how companies get fake reviewers.
2021-05-19 11:48:04,wallstreetbets,Oh? Do they mail them to you or are they just digital numbers like everywhere else?
2021-05-19 14:36:13,wallstreetbets,Where have you been? It's been tanking since it's IPO
2021-05-19 12:20:59,wallstreetbets,"Thought mine didn’t, turns out it pushed my order through 2x, good thing I didn’t yolo into something."
2021-05-19 11:47:36,wallstreetbets,unregulated? lol no they are not unregulated
2021-05-19 11:07:54,wallstreetbets,Investigated for what? there are no regulations. This is what everyone wanted. remember this when your uncle is going on and on about small governments and regulations ruining everything.
2021-05-19 11:49:08,wallstreetbets,"It’s more likely that when volatility explodes so does volume and they are just not setup to handle it.

Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
-Hanlons razor"
2021-05-19 13:04:07,wallstreetbets,They don’t care if people buy or sell bro. They make money on fees not the prices of the coins. Their server is just a piece of shit.
2021-05-19 13:30:01,wallstreetbets,"Gemini was down for a bit today, but overall I think it's better than most."
2021-05-19 14:22:32,wallstreetbets,"Kraken works pretty well for me, the load times def take longer but it never just shuts me out. Also, their phone app typically will load faster than desktop so sometimes I switch to that if the loading takes too long."
2021-05-19 16:13:15,wallstreetbets,I hear eToro but maybe bc they are still new and have lower volume?
2021-05-19 16:43:39,wallstreetbets,Voyager is probably worse when it comes to crashing... lol. Coin base sucks their fees are high too
2021-05-19 12:51:46,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if i am wrong, but coinbase is a centralized exchange, no?"
2021-05-19 15:18:56,wallstreetbets,"I bought at $31,000 on Coinbase this morning"
2021-05-19 12:55:14,wallstreetbets,"Coinbase isn’t decentralized. There are huge issues with decentralized markets as welll, trying to trade on ETH gas prices right now are insane - but Coinbase is not decentralized."
2021-05-19 13:23:37,wallstreetbets,Anyone selling on this big of a drop has no foresight. Its gonna come back
2021-05-19 13:12:28,wallstreetbets,You don’t have to trade there. There are plenty credible exchanges that you can use.
2021-05-19 14:37:34,wallstreetbets,use decentralized exchanges to trade decentralized stuff. problem solved
2021-05-19 14:08:11,wallstreetbets,not if no one can buy/sell on their platform
2021-05-19 12:08:58,wallstreetbets,You can do limit orders on Coinbase? Shiiiitt
2021-05-19 11:55:02,wallstreetbets,Hard to do that even with web page frozen.
2021-05-19 12:47:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah whole site freezes up.
2021-05-19 12:27:49,wallstreetbets,Sheesh I'm trying to get a good conspiracy story going here. Work with me people.
2021-05-19 13:52:42,wallstreetbets,"Same here man, been off and on all day and zero issues for me."
2021-05-19 14:27:23,wallstreetbets,What wallet would you suggest? I’m sick of Coinbase’s fees.
2021-05-19 11:32:36,wallstreetbets,It all started when u/Damascinos was a little boy in Bulgaria.
2021-05-19 11:54:05,wallstreetbets,No of course not . When money is involved there would not be a conspiracy. That never happens.
2021-05-19 12:01:33,wallstreetbets,Maybe you are part of the conspiracy. Like people that post fake reviews. Just here to spread the word there is no conspiracy.
2021-05-19 12:15:20,wallstreetbets,Nanomachines SON
2021-05-19 12:40:39,wallstreetbets,was capital actually raised? I thought they were just bringing it up?
2021-05-19 14:51:54,wallstreetbets,they took my fucking money
2021-05-19 13:59:18,wallstreetbets,"They offered it, doesn't mean there have been takers (yet)"
2021-05-19 12:05:02,wallstreetbets,"Lmao why is that even a thing. 

It's like saying ""hey I don't have faith that this company is gonna grow and I'm gonna sell my stake in it ""

It's basically shorting your own company.

If they did one thing,  it's time it right."
2021-05-19 12:06:35,wallstreetbets,"yea they got themselves set, just in case there company flops."
2021-05-19 15:32:51,wallstreetbets,They just need to update their adobe acrobat reader. And maybe turn their servers off and turn them back on again.

Holding your digital assets on an exchange is a bad idea. (See MtGox). Moving your coins to an exchange to make urgent trades is extremely unreliable. Gemini was having connection issues for me and I was just checking prices. I'm holding long-term and have for years now. This swing looks a lot better when I zoom out. If I had gotten in this year I'd be reeling this morning."
2021-05-19 10:25:56,wallstreetbets,This is the first time I have experienced it
2021-05-19 12:28:22,wallstreetbets,Happens every time you want to sell.

2021-05-19 12:29:24,wallstreetbets,You got a source for this 🧐🧐 my understanding was ark was in reference to surviving major disruption... Which still a religious reference but she listens to God for investment decisions? I want this source!

I have experienced it at least 6 times in high volatility. I thought that after they went public and with the billions in revenue they were generating it would get better but they either don't care or they do it on purpose for a fast swing from their holdings to the public after prices spring back up.
2021-05-19 10:47:24,wallstreetbets,This is one of many occurrences when they have conveniently been experiencing technical difficulties at an opportune time. Additionally they have taken money out of my checking account without my authorization and have taken days/week to put it back in

2021-05-19 12:14:37,wallstreetbets,Companies go public for a lot of reasons and if you don't need to raise any more capital there is no point to diluting current shareholders to go public.
2021-05-19 12:14:16,wallstreetbets,"Early investors are going to want to take their gains sooner or later, so they need to put the the company on the market to sell some of their stake. The company is already profitable, so they didn’t need to dilute it by adding new shares."
2021-05-19 15:25:01,wallstreetbets,"For the company, they can take on regular debt and get better terms than issuing stock. Or they don't really need to raise funds, they had ~$600m in profit this last quarter. 

The shareholders could have sold the shares privately even without it being listed. And this is what usually happens so the earlier investors can cash out

For the thousands of coinbase employees with stock, it is a huge risk to have so much of your net worth and your future income tied to one company. Just mathematically, even if you 100% believe in the company and expect them to outperform the market 500%, it makes financial sense to diversify, you get better risk adjusted return, a higher sharpe ratio."

2021-05-19 13:32:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah Gemini was struggling for me earlier.  Still managed to buy some more ETH at $2500 though!
2021-05-19 14:50:47,wallstreetbets,Kraken. Great exchange. In business since 10+years. Never let me down. Very low to nothing fees compared to others
2021-05-19 13:22:59,wallstreetbets,"> Holding your digital assets on an exchange is a bad idea. (See MtGox). Moving your coins to an exchange to make urgent trades is extremely unreliable. 

Full disagree. You're seriously exaggerating here, imo. While there are outages, especially with Coinbase, they've got way better over the last few years. I've had maybe one or two issues over the past year. Heck, you can even use Coinbase Pro, no issues at all. I've had most of my assets on Coinbase since 2017 and don't regret it at all. 

I also don't understand what you mean by 'holding them on an exchange is a bad idea', followed by 'moving your coins to an exchange for urgent trades is extremely unreliable'. If you're holding your coins on the exchange (like coinbase), then you remove the step of moving them there in order to 'make urgent trades'. The coins are already on the exchange and you can 'make urgent trades' instantly. 

> Gemini was having connection issues for me and I was just checking prices.

That's because Gemini is unmitigated horseshit. I don't know how anyone can use that app for more than five minutes without immediately deleting it. I tried it out and instantly hated it, then hopped on Twitter and saw TJ Miller pimping it and it all clicked together. It's trash."
2021-05-19 18:09:37,wallstreetbets,"can confirm. I watched GME go from $40 to $400 though, so this is nothing new."

2021-05-19 15:34:24,wallstreetbets,Well if it saves you tons of money by letting you decide how much people pay and how much you pay then it's really not incentivized to be fixed at all is it

2021-05-19 14:40:07,wallstreetbets,Absolutely worth it! You are paying way too much in fees on regular Coinbase. Get Pro and you can always move it to regular. Pro is for trading. Regular is more like a wallet than anything.
2021-05-19 14:09:22,wallstreetbets,you do have pro just go to the pro.coinbase version of the site. It's the same account minus the exorbinant trading fees

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

2021-05-19 14:12:26,wallstreetbets,"You might be right, it’s difficult to foresee an upturn in production coincide with a decrease in price as this rarely happens. Pipeline issues causes prices to go up and then when it’s all over they realize they can just leave those prices right about where they’re at. Very likely same thing happens with the others. I don’t see an increase in wood production bringing it back down to 1/3 it’s current price or ammo- last March you’d buy 25 shell boxes of 12 GA for 6 bucks they’re 20+ now so even if it was caused by the pandemic I don’t think these things go back to where they were and at some point it’s not that everything is expensive it’s that the dollar in your pocket isn’t the same dollar it was."

2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GLD and GOLD. Useless crap but it's all about the narrative. Gold is for the most part useless. Similar to other nameless 'inflation hedges' that provide almost 0 current real world value. Might as well be beanie babies. However, it doesn't make a difference what you or I think. We go where the money goes. And the money is going towards this shiny piss colored rock.

The two tickers i'm shilling today are GLD and GOLD. GLD is the ETF that tracks the price of gold, and GOLD is a boomer mining company.

This DD isn't about technicals, though it doesn't take much to see gold is in a breakout trend after bouncing off a low. This DD isn't about GOLDs future earnings, balance sheet, etc. It's about the narrative.

Inflation fears abound, and people are now seeing that stonks don't always go up. Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit.

The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that).

There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice.

TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD.

Positions:

June 21 GLD 174c. And i'll be rollin.

June 21 GOLD 27c."
2021-05-19 09:20:34,wallstreetbets,Buy the physical metal. When Venezuela entered hyperinflation the price of gold took off for them. Its less about growth than keeping purchasing power. An example would be if you bought 400 dollars of gold in 1990  which was about one ounce vs putting that money in a savings account. The difference between which one would be worth more would be noticeable. Say interest increased your saving to 500(which would be an incredible return for savings) or 1700 for an ounce of gold today. The rule of thumb is one ounce of gold is worth a good tailored suit comparatively speaking
2021-05-19 09:07:23,wallstreetbets,"I would actually say you should ignore GLD and buy PHYS instead. GLD buys futures contracts and derivative products, while PHYS has to buy actual gold. 

When the people at Wallstreet Silver bought SLV (the equivalent of GLD) in massive quantities, it didn't move the price of underlying silver. Once they started buying PSLV (an ETF that takes delivery of actual silver) Comex inventories started to drop and the price has been steadily climbing. GLD is paper, PHYS will actually have to be covered with real God, so that's the ETF to buy.

It permanently encapsulates the labour required to put it in your hands - because producing another like it requires effort.

And if you bury it for a million years, it will remain exactly as you left it.

Contrast a currency note that can be produced at a whim on whatever printer is good enough.

I don't disagree with your general sentiment on sentiment, but there's a reason most of civilisation's sentiment has respected untaintable commodities.

As for value... The *intrinsic* value of gold is whatever you can mould it into by hand when the rest of civilisation has collapsed. Probably a bowl for your food since it's very malleable. The intrinsic value of most other currencies including crypto if you lean that way is its caloric value in a fire. Next to nil or actually nil. 

That's how I count intrinsic value. It's not that I expect civilisation to collapse, it's just the point when the actual intrinsic value of something becomes more apparent."

2021-05-19 12:13:43,wallstreetbets,The decline in $ROPE mentions definitely declined with the influx of GME Ape n00bs.

2021-05-19 10:15:11,wallstreetbets,We need a $ROPE / capita mentions on social media metric. Its the lagging confirmation of a bull-bear turn around.
2021-05-19 13:42:49,wallstreetbets,"Correlation = Causation.

Say ROPE 1,000,000 times, crash the market."
2021-05-19 16:43:07,wallstreetbets,I keep hearing about this company but whenever I type in the ticker it tells me it doesn't exist. How can I buy?

2021-05-19 10:29:04,wallstreetbets,"Need to adjust for overall comment activity. The lower we go, the fewer people there are left to all-in $ROPE."
2021-05-19 11:04:11,wallstreetbets,When will $ROPE start making a product that can support my tendies-loving frame?
2021-05-19 11:49:24,wallstreetbets,It's always a good time to go long on $ROPE.
2021-05-19 12:47:18,wallstreetbets,Can we see this but measured against GME? I feel like ROPE calls were printing on January 27th
2021-05-19 14:18:45,wallstreetbets,Looks like I should have bought SPY and nothing else. Good thing I have this $ROPE
2021-05-19 14:25:46,wallstreetbets,Is now a good time to buy $ROPE and if so how much should I buy?
2021-05-19 12:39:10,wallstreetbets,"What is rope? Who is rope? What can be rope? 

AMC and GME"
2021-05-19 14:00:30,wallstreetbets,No one says sp500 though they say spy

2021-05-19 12:56:54,wallstreetbets,Sounds solid. I would like to invest my life savings.

2021-05-19 09:46:49,wallstreetbets,Looks like the people who got their tendies are not interested in it anymore.
2021-05-19 18:37:28,wallstreetbets,I measure what amount of $ROPE will work best for my needs using a weighted average.
2021-05-19 13:42:57,wallstreetbets,haha. I love your flair! What's the story?
2021-05-19 08:33:33,wallstreetbets,you are welcome!
2021-05-19 18:16:37,wallstreetbets,"Causation doesn't have to go both ways. Saying rope doesn't make the market to down, but the market going down can cause people to rope."
2021-05-19 17:56:31,wallstreetbets,There's been a run on $ROPE products lately with the various coin crash. Trading may be restricted temporarily. But there's a lesser-known competitor called $BRIDGE that still has plenty of liquidity except for the Memphis area.
2021-05-19 11:40:36,wallstreetbets,"Why is it interesting though..? It’s super logical right? Market goes down: people mention ROPE, market goes up, people stop mentioning ROPE. Of course they’re inversely correlated. Or am I missing something?"
2021-05-19 12:43:23,wallstreetbets,Short $ROPE?
2021-05-19 19:14:31,wallstreetbets,Very legit please go down so I lose money
2021-05-19 14:21:38,wallstreetbets,"Typically our clientele invests in SPY puts when they should be watching Spy Kids instead. When they’re down to their first dollar, we take that dollar and provide them with a lifetime supply of rope. Be like our customers."

2021-05-19 13:08:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah but this proves it.
2021-05-19 18:26:19,wallstreetbets,"When they get down to their first dollar, a lifetime supply of rope is only like 6 ft... really depends on how tall they are."

Apes will decide their willingness to sell you back your synthetic shares huge enough to eliminate you and teach criminals not to sell what they do not own as that is a crime has gone unpunished for so long.

2021-05-19 13:13:04,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂It sucks when you get old and feel yourself turning into the get off my yard type adult. But it’s also exciting that teenagers are aware of the situation too. They should give Millennials shit for not putting up a fight against financial fraud and government corruption sooner. But it’s all good cause we here now and we ain’t fuck leaving

2021-05-19 13:45:04,wallstreetbets,"Comedies are always batting 50s, even really good ones. A lot of critics think of themselves above comedy as it tends to be a more entertainment driven film genre, rather than something complex and dramatic that reviewers want to praise and get their name on the box of.

Back in the day was even worse. People look back on Mel Brooks like he was the fucking king, but apart from his early catalogue, his movies always struggled critically. 

The 90s were also notorious for pompous critics who didn't know how to have fun. So many great 90s comedies have abysmal review scores."

2021-05-19 09:59:49,wallstreetbets,"The whole movie is a parody of all of those movies and it's great.

Cuba Gooding Jr's name in Boyz n the Hood is Trey, so Shawn Wayans name in this is Ashtray 😂

If you're planning on watching this for the first time, it will be 100% funnier if you've seen all the original movies first, and all the originals are awesome also, so it's a win-win."

**EDIT** Those two titles were off the top of my head. Looks like the original *Borat* isn't even in the top ten as reported by [Film Comment](https://www.filmcomment.com/article/top-20-longest-movie-titles/)

**EDIT 2** The link posted is like eight years old, so subsequent Borat movie does better, but it's hardly the winner

They act like they're at the helm of the real economy and not just market valuations. Their QE has only had a *marginal* influence on employment levels. The pandemic boosts, as well as what wages are available, plays a *much* larger role in whether people are in a rush to go back to work or not. If the unemployment rate is 6.1% now and it was 3.5% before the lockdown, we're already pretty close to normalizing. But after being stay-at-home parents for over a year, I'm not surprised working class people aren't in a rush to go back to their shitty jobs and then turn around and pay most of that for daycare. There are some moms who will never rejoin the workforce. We just aren't going to get back to pre-pandemic employment levels without both 1. UI extensions running their course and 2. a substantial increase in median wages... and that comes with inflation."

[Probably](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gm-and-ford-find-new-bulls-who-sees-shares-rising-40-51621442418) Barrons text:
> T￼wo analysts new to covering Ford Motor and General Motors are finding a lot to like about the traditional auto makers—so much in fact that they expect the stocks to gain about 40% from Wednesday’s trading prices.   
Matt Portillo and Jeoffrey Lambujon, a team at the brokerage firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., point out different positives in the companies.   
Portillo notes that General Motors (ticker: GM), for instance, has a “pole position” in autonomous driving, an assessment that might surprise Tesla (TSLA) investors since the electric-vehicle pioneer has been a perceived leader in driverless technology. And Lambujon is impressed with Ford’s (F) turnaround. 
Tudor Pickering rates the stocks Buy. The Ford price target is $17 a share. GM’s stands at $76. Both imply gains of about 40% from the prices they’re trading now."

“A decline in stocks is not a surprising event, it’s a recurring event—as normal as frigid air in Minnesota. If you live in a cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures, so when your outdoor thermometer drops below zero, you don’t think of this as the beginning of the next Ice Age. You put on your parka, throw salt on the walk, and remind yourself that by summertime it will be warm outside. A successful stockpicker has the same relationship with a drop in the market as a Minnesotan has with freezing weather. You know it’s coming, and you’re ready to ride it out, and when your favorite stocks go down with the rest, you jump at the chance to buy more”"

2021-05-19 11:34:12,wallstreetbets,"Being in GME is like joining a cult because the weird but kinda cute girl you're interested in is in it and says she can't sleep with you unless you're also a member. You attend meetings in some dude's basement that you're pretty sure is used for either ritual sacrifices or weird sex shit based on how it's dimly lit by candles and the iron handcuffs hanging from the ceilings. You roll your eyes every time the guy in the blood red cloak and hood talks about the rewards you'll receive in the afterlife if you just pledge your loyalty and donate your wealth to the cult. Your friends and family all make fun of you and call you a dumbass. 

A couple months later, you don't know how things got so out of hand but you're being pressured by the entire cult to drink the cyanide-laced Kool-Aid with them so you can all ascend to the promised land. You decide fuck it, you already lost your life savings in OTM FD's and the rest went to the cult so you could keep banging the same chick, who's been passed around multiple other members, and you've been pretty depressed so what do you have to lose? You chug down your portion out of a plastic Chuck-e-Cheese mug and then die in agony.

Pitch black nothingness. All of a sudden you feel warm sunshine on your face and smell a fresh ocean breeze mixed with the scent of mom's cinnamon buns. You open your eyes and wake up in the muscular arms of the god Thor. He whispers into your ears, ""It was all true, welcome to Valhalla."" He leads you to your yacht where you find 100 big bosomed women, every single one the most gorgeous you've ever seen, and all desperate to snort your unlimited supply of cocaine off your massive 12"" penis (you were only 3"" before). And this is exactly what it feels like to own shares of GME."

I rarely buy puts and, if I do, I don't hold them overnight. Yesterday I did and I did.

I only post this now since it seems the double-top was real and confirmed. In which case I would say this is not a dip buying situation but, I guess we will see. (I ain't selling my puts unless we get back above 410, FWIW.)"

2021-05-19 06:17:22,wallstreetbets,"Well I could have respected your comment until... you shared your maturity. I'll apologize for you, if anyone has viewed your post and not appreciated the derogatory comment to berate me as one with an intellectual disabilities. You clearly have not had someone that special in your life! Just consider it may be that many that reads these posts do have! I'd implore you remove it from your vocabulary. For a future reference you might try this as an example ""Dumbass"" as it clearly fits you I believe!  Without need of further sarcastic rejoinder, I'll share my reasoning. I had a decent amount of ETC, but damn I was tired of watching the value just dribble away at the rate of several thousands daily, since I had not entered at the most ideal price point, and having averaged down a few times to correct that, I was caught trying to average down and assumed I got caught as the value rose. No worries, I have done well with GME very well and luck have it, it continues, now today who knows it may come to have been a huge mistake, however I hope the 10 other contracts may prove to be just the ticket as I wait to see my ETC show me love once again! Have a great investing day!"

2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Plug Power Buy the Dip Window Closing Plug Power

Plug Power finally removed the overhang of uncertainty after restatement and as I expected there was no misconduct or abuse of internal controls. Plug reached all-time high of 73.18$ in January 26 but unfortunately they reported some issue in their cash value that called for restatement.

On May 10 it reached the low of 20.07$ and now this week the restatement was completed and it actually showed increased in revenue for the Q1. 

I am bullish about Plug Power despite Cramer trying to put it down simply because he didn’t like that Plug had to do restatement 🤦🏽‍♂️. Anyway, share your thoughts on comments. What do you think?"
2021-05-19 03:29:27,wallstreetbets,You had me at Cramer. Currently adding more PLUG at open
2021-05-19 03:38:54,wallstreetbets,PLUG will be 100$ at the end of the year

- 10x new customer contracts to be announced in 2021
- Niagara fall hydrogen to be the biggest project on earth 
- PLUG going after light heavy and consumer vehicles 
- Forecasted to capture 30% European market
- Federal subsidies to make hydrogen cheaper than gasoline

Great interview by Andy on CNBC. Don’t worry about shorts or volatility in near term. PLUg is headed to previous highs. Always do your dd. GL"
2021-05-19 11:46:15,wallstreetbets,"I've recently become optimistic on PLUG vs others in the sector (BLDP, FCEL, etc).  The amount of items in their queue seems promising.  Do I think it will 'moon' or 'squeeze'?  Absolutely not.  Are they making money right now?  Absolutely not - its a growth stock.

I bet we see $65 by EOY.  I have calls and shares.  I think they will start generating money in late 2022/2023.  This is definitely my long position (not a bag holder - missed that train earlier this year, thankfully).

Restatement aside, PLUG just can’t get its ish together. It is literally paying WMT and AMZN to buy its products (the whole Warrants debacle). It loses money on its products and services and it doesn’t hold technical hydro-related IP. It’s ONLY source of revenue is selling shares and PLUG sure does kee hitting that well.

Declining volume in gold buying. That's second technical signal.

Rural India dying en masse to COVID, which means next Spring there's going to be a lot of horny widows selling their wedding gold to make ends meat, and not enough men around to initiate new marriages which means declining demand for wedding gold. India's wedding rituals are one of the only large scale consumers of gold world wide. That's the third technical signal.

WSB DD calls for bull gold. That's the fourth technical signal, on the ""Inverse WSB to Profit"" thesis.

Gold bulls r' fukted. Shorting gold time."

India's wedding rituals are one of the only large scale consumers of gold world wide. That's the third technical signal.

Interesting point. I don't own gold now, but traded gold and silver a lot last time around a decade ago. Made lots of money going up, and lost lots of money going down. The India gift market (not jsut weddings, but other Indian holidays) is a big one."

The problem is that it could take several months or over a year to get there, which is not a timeline WSBers can wrap their heads around."

including global supply, higher demand from India does boost   
international prices too. While gold prices go up and down all the time,  
 trends show that it peaks during the Indian wedding season. According   
to a 2016 report in the Street, Moore Research Centre pointed out that   
over the last 15 years, traders buying gold on or around September 15   
and selling around October 8 would have been profitable around 80% of

“While others in our industry guide towards lower volumes in 2Q21, UWMC is quite the opposite,"" said Chairman and CEO Mat Ishbia. ""Because of our purchase focus and our broker network, we expect to do more business in 2Q21 than 1Q21 and believe that we will be one of the only mortgage companies in America that grows in a rising rate environment.""

2021-05-19 09:51:16,wallstreetbets,"Spy gapped down 5 dollars today, UWMC held up pretty well.  Spy should be bullish for the rest of the day, UWMC should close in the green today."
2021-05-19 12:36:05,wallstreetbets,I’ve 20k at 8.  Dividend and buyback protects downside and potential gamma and short squeezes make it an obvious trade.
2021-05-19 15:37:24,wallstreetbets,"Ape sees, ape likes, ape buys 10 shares at 8.25. Ape realises ape paid 83 in fees because ape lives in europe. Living the life of an ape hahaha every little counts"
2021-05-19 00:12:16,wallstreetbets,So does Shitidel own a good position of UWMC?
2021-05-19 00:43:28,wallstreetbets,Been red on this for a while.   We shall see

2021-05-19 06:19:25,wallstreetbets,Squeeze price prediction? maybe 15 or so?
2021-05-19 11:47:36,wallstreetbets,"If the ex date is June 9 should am I safe to sell cc’s after that date or am I still on the hook for the dividend if they get exercised.

2021-05-19 08:38:17,wallstreetbets,Where!?!?
2021-05-19 17:45:08,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is much larger than 1.5B in market cap, which is the high mark for what MSCI defines as a small cap. Did you mean mid cap, perhaps?

Even so, I believe it doesn't meet the free float criteria: ""If the Market Size-Segment Cutoff is within the Global Minimum Size Range for the 
Investable Market Index, a security can be included in the Investable Market Index 
only if its free float-adjusted market capitalization is at least 50% of the Market Size-
Segment Cutoff for the Investable Market Index"""
2021-05-19 06:34:28,wallstreetbets,Did the same
2021-05-19 09:46:20,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-05-19 13:28:12,wallstreetbets,90% counts as all in right guys ?
2021-05-19 17:32:48,wallstreetbets,I mean you can park money there for 5% while you wait for the squeeze. It's literally free money.
2021-05-19 12:51:55,wallstreetbets,So true
2021-05-19 02:15:51,wallstreetbets,And cause the gamma squeeze with the options chain.
2021-05-19 04:16:11,wallstreetbets,I'd already be happy at 9
2021-05-19 10:17:05,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-05-19 05:10:30,wallstreetbets,Proof! Haha
2021-05-19 08:04:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but they make most of their money from people refinancing. If the rates go up, less people will refinance."
2021-05-19 01:41:18,wallstreetbets,It’s two years for $300 million. It would come out to roughly half of the outstanding float if the price stayed around $10
2021-05-19 01:02:01,wallstreetbets,I heard they had 2 years to buy back but I’m not for sure
2021-05-19 11:58:52,wallstreetbets,Need to be at 9 …. Then tomorrow we squeeze
2021-05-19 01:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Just checked whalewisdom and they do. But they also have 14,000 rows of holdings, including both hedged calls and puts on UWMC. Shit is irritating though. Ken Griffin can get fucked."
2021-05-19 06:24:37,wallstreetbets,Who gives a fuck

2021-05-19 00:27:42,wallstreetbets,"Ride it until the ER. This is a sure riser because of the massive 300M buyback. They have used only about 100M of that, so plenty of steam left.

2021-05-19 06:58:05,wallstreetbets,Why would you hold something for months just to break even? Go back to your day job and ask for a raise then.
2021-05-19 12:53:51,wallstreetbets,"Yup, 12 shares at 8.30 for me."
2021-05-19 13:52:43,wallstreetbets,We all do what we can ;)
2021-05-19 17:48:10,wallstreetbets,350 at 5.5$ & 40 at 6$ - ready for this to shoot upward (need to cover my MVIS losses)

2021-05-18 23:55:13,wallstreetbets,Not that there’s anything wrong with that!
2021-05-19 06:42:27,wallstreetbets,"I think UWMC can hit $12 price targets without a squeeze. That can happen short-term depending on buybacks. 

With a squeeze? I don’t see why this can’t triple (so about $24) with the level of shorting. Especially if the $9c and $10c options could go into play by close on Friday. 

Of course, it’s psychological. If everyone sells at $15, then that’s as high as it goes."

2021-05-19 13:31:06,wallstreetbets,"They are more into originations not refinancing, many people think less refinancing is a problem and that's an absolute mistake"

2021-05-19 02:09:38,wallstreetbets,Source on them using $100 million already? I don’t think that’s right. They would have repurchased ~12 million shares in a few days. There’s no way

I didn’t say anything about selling to break even. My entry is low-7s. I think we can hit $12+ with no squeeze. If we squeeze, I’ll assess the situation, but I’ll probably try to ride it to $20-22 because it’s more fun that way."

2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Something that I may have found in VIX I was building a markov regime switching model of VIX returns and then computing the smoothed probability of low, medium, and high variance regimes. The graphs look like

https://preview.redd.it/c0elz0y9nzz61.png?width=406&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbe82378829ede0ccdfaaa7a7c1c52e9e9817222

The first thing that I noticed is that large spikes don't occur isolated

https://preview.redd.it/54vvzmabnzz61.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=078939a821d8d1b184090d7c37fce1f9ce2dd513

Another thing that I noticed was that the large spikes were only attributed to changes from medium to high regimes.

https://preview.redd.it/7gro1oucnzz61.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fcbfa73a5e42fdd7b0a66fc57d12a206ebbf6aa

And small spikes are associated with changes from low to high

https://preview.redd.it/ey455x8enzz61.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=21f43f131a07331093de1b85c3403fa477802d90

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

2008: great financial crisis

2010-2011: Worry about Euro zone breakup, first US credit downgrades due to debt ceiling (back in the day people used to worry about shit)

2015: Ebola in August, then the market just giving back some gains

Feb 2018: VIX levered ETF blowup

Late 2018: Market bubble tried to let off steam; Trump beat Powell into submission and plunge protection team saved the day

Late 2019: repo rate crisis, Fed saved the day

2020: I don't remember anything unusual that year.  So I guess your analysis is onto something.

2021-05-19 04:26:37,wallstreetbets,It’s weekly prices. More research will be done on smaller time frames. Smaller time frames has application to things like statistical arbitrage and even MM HFT strats. I picked a longer time frame to get cleaner time series and funds like Bridgewater use 100+ years of data so it’s not too out of the ordinary to look back this far.
2021-05-19 05:15:17,wallstreetbets,"I subscribe to black swan theory, it’s more like “when’s good time when the market is immaculately predicting risk because there will always be a next thing”."
2021-05-19 05:29:39,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. That’s probably not a hard time series to compare against given it’s binary, but the assumption may be a stretch so it’s give and take."
2021-05-19 10:37:03,wallstreetbets,"that is a possibility, honestly taking a black swan theory approach i think this is better used at determining when hedges are the cheapest and to determine if a black period of high variance returns will become a black swan."

2021-05-19 10:35:27,wallstreetbets,just because you can't trade a specific product doesn't mean the information extracted is useless. That's like saying reading the world news doesn't matter because the events never have in a close enough proximity to directly affect you.

2021-05-18 23:53:31,wallstreetbets,if you are talking about the streamlit i made it. It was actually for a demonstration because RenTec uses these kinds of methods and I wanted to show people with having them touching any code. But then I started looking more into. I tend to put most of my research stuff into apps so that I can run faster results and they are easier to use than code sometimes.
2021-05-19 01:26:51,wallstreetbets,Graphs are the only pictures where you need to read.

2021-05-19 11:28:05,wallstreetbets,"If you believe in Black Swan theory then you can use this as finding the best time to lock in those hedges. You could also use this to determine whether a change in high variance volatility will ""take water"" or is a short term fluctuation."

2021-05-19 11:54:13,wallstreetbets,"Charts are made by pulling all possible prices from 1900 to May 17th (I think). Applying the results to right now I would say that with the recent minor spikes within in high-variance regimes we are probably off to some rocky future events. If the regime comes from small to high then I would say its short term minor spike. If the regime comes from medium to high then I would be a bit worried that there will be a big spike in high regime, also if that happened I would start looking for non-financial events that could move markets or possibly an overvalued asset that may *burst*"

2021-05-19 13:56:52,wallstreetbets,"It actually does but the statsmodel API uses the print function within the API. But to print an output to screen on the app you have to use their output function. So to get those states I would manually have to go into the statsmodel API and rewrite the code to output to the screen which would be a bunch of work. When I transition the code base to work solely with a jupyter notebook it will print out the results. You can always find the results by forking the repo and via command line  running the streamlit run and the the boundaries of the states will be outputted on the command line. I wish I could add that in, but I would have to change the statsmodel API, and I would also have to load all those files into my GitHub repo for it to run on Streamlit."

2021-05-19 14:01:07,wallstreetbets,Silver Futures .... For those Unaware of Future contracts.... Since Mar 29 recent low for silver around $23.80 to recent high $28.80....  that $5 move equated to a 150% Gain/Return on futures contracts if entered at low and exited at high.  Futures have a Preferred Taxation of 60% Long/ 40% Short Term meaning Reduced Tax Liability.  Due Diligence to enter and exit cycles will equate to a Huge Gain using Futures which run from Sunday 5 Pm until Friday 5 Pm continuously except for a 1 hour break each day from 4 to 5 pm CST.    Hope that brings some attention for unknowing.  HOWEVER... WARNING.... BE AWARE OF CONTRACT ROLLOVER DATES meaning Expiration of current futures contract which could put you in a REAL HURTBAG.....   Again.. Hope this was Helpful.    Also use Copper Futures as a indicator of market Overbought or Oversold status....

If you just leave it at that, it’s the same problem: you paint your target around the hits. If you test your hypothesis elsewhere, it’s fine. And yes this is a bit simplified, but just looking for patterns is the same as reading tea leaves.

This then conflates with selectively picking successes: I can draw all sorts of doritos on all my positions, but then I’ll post only the one that seems to confirm my hypothesis, as the other ones are boring."

2021-05-19 18:12:22,wallstreetbets,Haha hearing about spreads made me think I was in r/options lmao
2021-05-18 22:10:51,wallstreetbets,Why don't you try flipping a coin and see how many times you get 95 heads/5tails. Come back to me when you learn what Delta and Gamma risk is. The fact he made money this time is a fallacy of composition. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
2021-05-19 08:58:10,wallstreetbets,"It’s just a measure of profitability. You risk 20% for 80% returns.

In the end, price movement is what really matters. And, because of how spreads are calculated, gains and losses are limited to your entry. In the case of the OP, getting @ $1.08 rather than $2/$3/$4 made have have a lot of room to grow gains"
2021-05-18 23:56:16,wallstreetbets,He is doing weeklies. The further out you go the better chance you have if the trade working out but you will get lower returns per trade as well.
2021-05-19 01:19:26,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-18 22:23:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this is a classic ""better walk away now"" move."
2021-05-18 22:40:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah but all ya gotta do is flip heads 15 times in a row with 100 bucks and you have 3.2mil.
2021-05-19 09:00:23,wallstreetbets,"Got it, thanks dude."
2021-05-18 23:58:07,wallstreetbets,"And the only way he looses money is if Tesla closes below 175 at expiry, correct?"
2021-05-19 12:42:40,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-19 06:01:42,wallstreetbets,"But he won’t, nobody ever does after their big lucky win.

In 3 months his account balance will be lower than when he started and he’ll spend the next year trying to catch up to where he started."
2021-05-18 23:21:58,wallstreetbets,yeah...all ya gotta do...why make it so complicate? All you gotta do is win lottery once
2021-05-18 23:59:53,wallstreetbets,Not exactly. He had to pay some amount for the spread. Using the picture as an example if GME (not Tesla) closed below 156.08 he would lose money since his cost basis was 1.08
2021-05-19 18:24:16,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-19 04:59:11,wallstreetbets,"A lot better probability to flip 15 straight heads (1:32000) than win the lottery (1:300,000,000 for powerball)"

2021-05-18 22:24:01,wallstreetbets,"They’re preparing for a market crash within the next 3 weeks…

If you don’t believe me. Put a remind me for the 15th.

This is the 2008 bubble all over again with some inflation.

Banks are funding massive margins in derivatives and holding negative debt. They hold 136 Trillion $ currently in derivatives alone. With the amount money we have printed within the past 3 years, we can’t spend to fix this issue.

The lates SEC updates were to ensure HFs have the ability to hold their positions. Shits about to hit the fan.

If one hedge fund is margin called with the way our market is set at this moment, the market could have a domino effect that takes it all down. Ryan Cohen may have crashed the world market. 

Power to the Players."

2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Discovering the True Rate of Inflation: A DD on the Fed *Would have posted on* r/investing*,  but they don't allow graphs. Read at your own risk.*

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

2021-05-18 21:16:34,wallstreetbets,The first narritive is true in some sense. There is defitinely pent up buying pressure from households but the rising prices from commodities and supply chain costs will add fuel to the inflation. I think the shipping lines have already said that they will keep the prices high at least until 2023 and part of the worlds commercial fleet being scrapped in early 2020 from the pandemic a lot new ships needs to be build which in turn adds more pressure to the commodity prices a long with infra projects all over the world. I think the manufactures in asia have already said that they have to raise their prices due the rising prices of commodities and the mining companies are lacking behind in production which affects the price of base metals. It all just seems too much to just be trasitatory inflation from pent up buying. Will it lead to economic shock? Tf should i know. But inflation(more than the usual amount) will most likely continue after households have spent their covid savings imo.

Excerpt from the study:

> The generational new deal is the hardest scenario to envision as it will be progressively defined over the course of
the next decade. Broadly speaking, a generational new deal would contain three elements.
> 
> 1- Limited bailouts: politicians and voters would realize the futility of trying to restore the world of yesterday.
Whether it is fair or not, the post-Covid 19 world will need fewer cruise ships and cars, as fewer workers commute to their offices. Airlines CEOs, who failed to prepare for what should have been a normal business risk after the SARS, avian flu, and Ebola outbreaks, do not deserve to get bailed out. Neither do investors who bought junk bonds in highly leveraged companies, or the private equity managers who sold them. The U.S. bankruptcy system is designed to reorganize failed businesses and transfer their assets into stronger hands. Creative destruction is the true engine of long-term growth: it should be encouraged, or at least allowed.
>
> 2- Large fiscal response: record low interest rates, mass unemployment, and depressed commodity prices create a
generational opportunity to “build stuff” – in the words of entrepreneur Marc Andreesen. Hospitals, dams, 5-G towers, windmills, solar panels … the bigger the better. Austrian types will correctly point out that some of this production will be wasted on bridges to nowhere, pork barrel politics, and the kind of highly visible but
uneconomical projects that bureaucrats crave, such as high-speed bullet trains. Encouraging the private sector to build simple things, such as affordable houses near major urban centers, could reduce the risk of wasteful spending. But ultimately, even wasteful government spending would achieve the goal of injecting money into the
economy, provide employment, and eventually kickstart inflation.
>
> 3- Inflationary policies: **inflation is the only politically palatable solution to the generational crisis.** A decade of
high single-digit inflation would wipe out about two third of the outstanding value of all student debt ($1.6 trillion), encouraging household formation, boosting discretionary spending, and eventually reversing the decline in births. A flexible universal basic income would allow the government to target a desired price level much more effectively than the failed monetary policies of the past decade. Protectionist measures would transfer purchasing power from idle consumers (the old) to the working producers (the young).
>
> The generational inflation gap I mentioned in the earlier part would eventually shrink. Housing prices would
fall because of the recession at first, and then thanks to an increase in the supply of affordable homes in tense housing markets. Medicare for all, for which the moral case has never been stronger, would spread the rising cost of healthcare across generations. Medicare for all would also reduce the cost of labor, increase
competitiveness, and boost economic flexibility as workers would be able to switch jobs more easily. Last, if the world economy can work on Zoom meetings, so can classes of 30 college students. Colleges have shown true genius to preserve their rents, escape competition, and ignore the technological revolutions of the past 30 years, but Covid-19 may eventually be lethal to university mandarins. The real value of a fancy college education (becoming part of a professional network after graduation, four years of boozing without many
responsibilities, and mating with members of the same socio-economic status) cannot be realized on online
classes. Students will not pay $56,631 a year to watch Youtube videos, even if they are dispensed at Ivy League universities. Travel restrictions may continue to curtail the flow of wealthy foreign students, whose exorbitant fees keep this inefficient system afloat."

2021-05-18 22:16:09,wallstreetbets,"Paying back a loan destroys money. Because the governments have funded through debt, or deficit spending, the debt needs to be serviced. Servicing a debt destroys money. Deficit spending pulls demand forward for current consumption at the cost of future consumption. Inflation will be transitory as the current consumption spiked considerably. Its how long it can stay transitory that is in question right now. Transitory could mean another 12months from now. Its absurd to think there isnt inflation right now. But how long it lasts is unclear. Theres a saying that you cant be a ‘little bit’ pregnant. One would argue that once inflation is here you cant put it back in the bottle.

The fiscal policy is what has changed from the GFC. Wage subsidies and unemployment and all the help for businesses was effectively helicopter drops of money. A lot of it doesnt need to be paid back, some of it is taxed, some of it not, all depends on the country/state/province etc. I myself cant say for sure but time will tell if the fiscal policy is enough to drive a sustained inflation year over year. 

Between debt and fiscal policy, im not sure which force will win. But lets just be clear, the fed is not ‘printing’ money, its deficit spending. Deficit spending is inflationary AT FIRST. QE is not money printing, its not inflationary. 

Any policy changes or legal changes such as turning federal reserves into usable cash would be things to watch out for.

2021-05-19 01:17:14,wallstreetbets,"The only reason you have ""inflation"" is because the FED is a group of private gangsters who granted themselves the rights to create money out of thin air and then ""loan"" it to the ""government"" Sound money created at cost does not generate inflation. This is a big carny scam"
2021-05-19 10:07:21,wallstreetbets,"When it comes to inflation, it's best to measure it on your own (in some cases, you can see changes and make adjustments).  But for all of us, it will differ because what I consider a necessity, you may not (or vice versa).  [Here's a breakdown of the principles I use for measuring inflation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5UZs5OEVqQ) \- in this video, I note that using the same baseline area and necessities, I've seen an average of about 8% inflation per year.  However, you could use the same area baseline and your necessities and come up with a higher or lower number. 

The biggest key to understand is that the Fed's numbers DO NOT tell you about your reality and they can't.  They're estimates overall, but that can heavily differ for a variety of factors, geography being one of many."

2021-05-19 01:28:26,wallstreetbets,"NUE doesn’t actually make steel, they recycle it. Which is great, but at some point the supply of scrap steel gets low and they’re out of luck. X is much less popular among analysts because they actually make new steal from ore, which the other companies don’t. It’s slightly more expensive, and a competitive disadvantage... until the economy actually wants meet new steel. And since we are already importing, that day is coming.

2021-05-19 07:01:49,wallstreetbets,"The mortgage interest deduction doesn’t impact 90% of taxpayers.  Removing it will do nothing.

Edit: I’d be very surprised if people are considering the mortgage interest deduction on their itemized deductions when considering a purchase of a home.     The standard deduction blows itemized deductions out of the water for almost all but the highest taxpayers.    The deduction is also capped, there’s so little tax advantage to it outside of very specific strategies that I don’t see this toothpick to be what’s propping up the housing prices."
2021-05-19 04:59:03,wallstreetbets,"I suspect the treasury bond market is being propped up by 60/40 portfolios.  Once the people realize what’s happening then there will be a flight to equities, commodities, and real assets, and the Fed will probably have to act with YCC to suppress long yields.

2021-05-18 22:35:05,wallstreetbets,"I’m glad you enjoyed it! But I have questions:
You say QE isn’t inflationary. Could you expand on why that’s the case? I thought QE monetized bank assets, enabling them to lend more, which would definitely be inflationary.
Second, one thing I think this chart is showing is that government policy has been oriented towards using deficit spending to generate demand, even at the risk of inflation. If you’re right that the inflation will be transitory, then might that mean the government has been pulling demand forward for… 13 years? 20 years? The answer might honestly be yes, and that would be how the next Great Depression happens"
2021-05-19 06:48:17,wallstreetbets,QE is inflationary for asset prices and it is very similar to money printing in that case. QE all over the world made asset prices explode in the last decade.

2021-05-19 00:15:44,wallstreetbets,"I think you’re overthinking this analysis a little bit.
 I’m selecting the basket of goods simply from what people are currently buying. That’s obviously different from the methodology of selecting a basket of essential goods that the government uses, but it does allow me to make a claim like: “if your spending habits were the same in 2011 as they are today, and were representative of the average American, you could expect your expenses to have increased 4.27% per year.” 
It’s intentionally not designed to be comparable to other inflation statistics, but it does shed some light on the accuracy of the government’s claim that their inflation statistics represent changes to real prices. 
But basically, if you disagree with how I constructed the basket, then this analysis isn’t gonna work for you."

2021-05-19 10:10:59,wallstreetbets,"My answer to that problem is 1) wealth inequality. Much of the money the (Bernie Sanders voice) billionaihs and trillionahs gained in the last year may only be marginally visible to the economy. Panama papers, etc. I also doubt their spending habits are transparent enough to make it onto BLS or OECD stats, so their spending habits are likely invisible to my chart. 
2) elasticity. People have an expectation around how much they should pay for something, and if the price rises too high, they’ll just stop buying if it’s not essential. This is actually a core part of the Fed’s strategy with their CPI, as it mostly looks at true essentials. They probably reason that beyond those items, inflation should be self limiting."

Supply chain costs and bottle necks will continue for at least 2 more years(2023). Saying that it is transitatory is kind of risky imo.

2021-05-18 22:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Check out Lyn Alden, she will explain a lot better than I can here.

Basically

1) QE = generating bank reserves/financial price inflation as the reserves are used mainly for leverage loans on financial assets. Without fiscal policy, the money just stays in the system, it doesn't get spent. Basically, there's an inverse correlation between QE and velocity of money, which are offsetting each other absent any fiscal.

2) hadn't thought about this. Guh"
2021-05-18 23:04:01,wallstreetbets,"yes lol. The government using debt is the same as anyone else. They must pay interest on it, or 'service' the debt. Im not certain that inflation is transitory, just the nature of deficit spending is transitory. Think about you getting a loan to buy a house. You are instantly granted 500k and buy a house with it. Now you pay it back slowly over time, plus interest. The interest stays in the system, the principal is effectively destroyed. You pulled demand forward to buy the house today, at the expense of putting a portion of income aside each month to pay it off; money that could have otherwise been used on other purchases.

We still are paying back debt from ww2. 

In terms of QE being inflationary, its been happening since the early 2000s in Japan, then the US, UK, EU, and now almost everyone and inflation didnt occur with those cases. You need to look at bank lending data, new loans created. Highly recommend you read everything you can about QE, its an interesting banking policy."

2021-05-19 00:30:43,wallstreetbets,"People aren't buying in 2021 the same products that they were in 2011. People often buy more expensive and luxurious goods than previously. That's not inflation but instead a change in taste to something better. Consider for example, in California the average home prices have risen, its true... But these aren't the same homes of 2011 or 2001 or 1991. These homes are bigger, with more luxurious bathrooms and kitchens. They don't build inexpensive housing because people aren't buying the inexpensive stuff. They want the fancy stuff.

By changing the basket of goods the way you have, you are incorporating society's change in tastes and preference into your measurement, which is not inflation, rather than increase in price for the same exact goods, which is inflation.

Like I said, you are measuring something... but it isn't inflation."
2021-05-19 02:21:50,wallstreetbets,My wife doesn't like that option
2021-05-19 10:20:30,wallstreetbets,"Good points, but the price of food has more than doubled, lumber has quadrupled, etc.

We're already well over 100% inflation in real terms in the last year and a half alone.

Granted, a good chunk of that is that farms simply aren't profitable: they've always been subsidized in the last several decades if not half century with things like multi-million-dollar loans to form indentured servants of farmers who then build an operation and sell for pennies on the dollar to large agricultural corporations, and with the large corporations pushing for increased consumer prices while the farmers aren't taking the bait that just becomes more apparent - I only really see that going away with grants (not loans) to farms en mass (that's the only thing which really suppressed the rise in prices compared to say lumber last year.)  This is more apparent in things like small/local organic farms where costs of goods more closely match the cost to produce them (they still have gotten grants over the years, but not as much as Joe Retard being handed 3 million, blowing it all on building a thing without a functional cost basis, then liquidating.)

Lumber could be chalked up to increased demand with everyone renovating their homes due to spending more time there and prioritizing that aspect of life more, but 4x is still quite a leap in costs when the infrastructure already exists to meet the demand.

2021-05-19 04:49:02,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.  QE isn't really about improving employment.  Its purposes are 1) to prevent the market from crashing and thus fucking everyone over, and 2) to allow government deficits forever."

I think we'll learn a lot about how things will play out after a correction, I've seen some forecasts on Blomberg of a correction in the (-38%, -10%) range depending on how  badly markets react to a rate hike."
2021-05-19 09:39:37,wallstreetbets,"Great perspective.

This illustrates the absolute insanity of the current market…

Negative EU Rates > Higher US Rates+$Depreciation

Thanks US Fed…"
2021-05-19 10:25:44,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no... fewer buyers and subsidies would mean prices drop significantly. Which obviously hurts current homeowners (I’m one of them). But then you go back to 20% down payments, which were the norm for a long time before the Feds got involved. With higher down payments, rates probably wouldn’t rise much. The overall decline in values would hit landlords, but result in lower rent. So people would pay less rent, allowing them to save for a house, which would be much more affordable, meaning they have a smaller principal payment, and can possibly go to the 10-15 year mortgages, which used to be the norm. All this reduces the lifetime cost of homeownership by hundreds of thousands of dollars, while also reducing rent. 

It would get a lot harder for a single landlord to leverage up and buy 10 houses, but a lot easier for a family to save a few years and buy one."

2021-05-19 19:17:49,wallstreetbets,"No, it means they don't pay enough other tax + mortgage interest to make itemizing worth it.

You get to take one or the other, mortgage interest + State (or sales) and local taxes.  

The standard deduction is $12,400 single, $24,800 married. That means for the mortgage interest deduction to make sense, you need to annually pay more than whatever is the amount for your situation in mortgage interest + state/local/property taxes (up to 10k even if married) such that that adds up to more than your standard deduction.

For much of America that doesn't happen.  If you make good money in a high tax, high cost state, sure."
2021-05-19 14:54:20,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Even more so. Saying the mortgage interest credit is keeping the housing prices inflated is like saying the captain pissing his pants is what flooded the Titanic.  Technically it contributes, but on such a small scale it doesn’t make an impact.   

As you mentioned, a huge swath of the population doesn’t even technically pay taxes after numerous deductions.  The few people who take the itemized deductions, and therefore are able to utilize the mortgage interest deduction, are typically reporting enough income, and therefore paying (typically a lot) of taxes.    

In short, OP says the homeowners mortgage interest credit is keeping home prices high by incentivizing large mortgages.    I’m saying virtually no-one benefits from those because only a small set of the population itemizes.  For those that do, State Taxes and Medical Expenses are generally a more relevant decision."
2021-05-18 20:42:58,wallstreetbets,"I personally don’t think so. Why? Elasticity. All the things that are hugely increasing in price right now are not necessities, and therefore are very elastic.

2021-05-19 01:01:34,wallstreetbets,"Re: QE
The operation occurs through the prime brokers. Meaning not many banks have direct access to the reserves.

Also, QE reduces availability of the market's preferred collateral for short term (inter-bank) lending. If the markets for money are less liquid from perspective of banks who actually engage in lending to consumers/business, how can the inflationary effects of those (consumer/business) loans follow?"
2021-05-19 09:06:42,wallstreetbets,To be fair I'm not saying we don't have inflation. I'm just saying that some of what we see as inflation in everyday life is due to material improvement. Some but not all.
2021-05-19 00:59:28,wallstreetbets,"Something else to consider in regards to home prices... Home values are inversely proportional to the interest rate. Rates go down, home prices go up and vice versa. This is because people buy what they can afford, in other words, their max payment. So when home prices rise but rates go down, their max payment stays the same, but they can afford to pay more. Measuring a change in average housing payment would be a better measure of inflation in housing than measuring home price, because the change in home price is exaggerated by the drop in interest rates. But again, then you've also got the change in tastes and quality to deal with in housing. I would say you could measure specific neighborhoods and see what the average payment is for a home in that neighborhood, but then it doesn't factor in depreciation of the houses as they age. Idk housing seems like the worst and hardest way to measure inflation. There's too many factors to account for. Even a change in insurance due to fire, flood, etc., or change in taxes can affect it since this changes the price of the mortgage payment."

For $500 you can get an FPV drone, for another $500 you can put a FLIR camera on it. Now you can scout your target from hundreds of yards away even when it's pitch black. Pick off the adults through a window from the nearest treeline. Minimal risk, pretty simple with basic marksmanship as long as you can handle the psychological trauma of ending another human life.

2021-05-19 07:59:30,wallstreetbets,"I’d also agree with you there, and I used something similar to mortgage payments- “cost of ownership”- for that part of the model. So that’s basically mortgage, property taxes, and maintenance, but not utilities. 
In general, I don’t think it’s too hard to measure- we know what everyone had to spend to have a house for the last ten years, so we can approximate from there. You just have to not care why those prices are increasing, which, as you mention above, is still important"

As your savings grows you'll have more money to gamble and it will snowball. Learn from it, and remember your not alone, it's not easy for anyone. These are things smart people have told me over the years. And be patient"
2021-05-19 00:54:49,wallstreetbets,">Maybe only gamble with 10-25% 

Probably my biggest problems. I got banned from day trading and my portfolio was 99% options. Lots of shit went my way the whole day then absolutely got fucked during after hours and pre market. Big winners turned to losers over and over and over and over. I like the 10-25% idea. The rest in shares in companies I believe in. I didn't gamble anything I couldn't afford to lose but man it sucks losing it. I really appreciate the kind words and encouragement and advice man means a lot to me. Thank you."
2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$RIDE - It's Nowhere Near Over Yet! In my opinion, Hindenburg and their co-conspirators still owe a massive debt to $RIDE investors. And I'd like nothing better than to see every penny returned, and then some, for the trouble. I intend to keep the hammer down on these grifters until they're begging for my shares. And then watch them beg some more!

The only way to stop these types of organized and unwarranted short attacks is to punish the perpetrators financially, again and again. Then, and only then, will you have a free and fair market for all.

$GME is the perfect example of how individual investors discussing the value of a company and deciding they like the stock enough to buy shares and options, can have a profound and unintended effect. And as a consequence of that effect, some folks who often make a living pedaling lies and half-truths, lost a lot of money. As I see it, there is no better lesson than a bought lesson.

2021-05-19 02:33:10,wallstreetbets,"Well...there is a problem.

Having spoken to ex employees( short lived employment), it is clear that the company is full of cheerleaders, technically incompetent and lazy individuals.

Aside, I m glad that this is an American company embarking on new technology.

The reality is that LM needs to work on building its core management and technical leadership.  They are at this point far from that level.

To excel in this market, you need smart and dedicated engineers, capable technicians and assembly workers and above average management.   Lacking this , the product ideas and implementation on all level-software, electrical, mechanical, manufacturing is impossible.  Products are not ready, income is missing and market reacts. Right now, LM cannot convince investors that they can deliver.

The fact is that many tickers beside RIDE lost  on its value in past 5 months.  There are too many companies on the market that produce nothing but promises, have zero sales and rely on stock price up-down cycles to make up income.

Too many retail investors ask what happened with their investments.   They ask why are their chosen picks losing value.  Well... Managements issued shares.  In 2020, many tickers had increase in share prices.  Lacking sales and contracts, managements in conjunction with brokerage and investment firms are now selling shares they issued which results in price downtrend.  As the prices recover, managements are buying shares back, just to sell shares at higher prices some time later.  Rinse and repeat-to pay for labor, supplies, services, etc.  Yes...managements who issued their own stocks are shorting (and longing) independently or in cooperation with large funds.

In a nutshell, the stock market is keeping all these 0 cars EV, make a promise pharma and other companies alive.  Who cares-it's the modern economy after all.  On the top of that add large investment firms who cycle the buy -sell activity as their profit appetite desires....  The equilibrium is somewhere in the middle, a resultant of desires and targets of all players-large and small.

If any investor or trader thinks that some entity is after his/her shares, it is most likely  that the founder and/or management of the very company an investor invested in is just manipulating as they please."

2021-05-19 02:12:49,wallstreetbets,"It already debuted, just won't be for sale for a while. So the door is still open a crack for LMC to push through if they can get the job done on time."

Its going to be a long while before supply catches up to demand once a utilitarian EV truck of any make is available.

2021-05-18 20:23:17,wallstreetbets,They really need to merge as one. WKHS needs a manufacturing plant big enough to mass produce and Ride needs sales. They are perfect for each other. I know Rides CEO left WKHS but they just beed to merge.
2021-05-19 03:22:34,wallstreetbets,"That's some serious pressure though.

Don't get me wrong, I have a 17.5c Jan '23 along with a decent number of shares, but Ford sells more trucks than anyone, and they've got a full electric prototype that would spank the Endurance betas. They trust it enough to have the president drive it."
2021-05-19 03:41:45,wallstreetbets,"The market is big enough for the both, but my logic is that Ford will quickly swallow up any first mover advantage. At this rate, Ford may beat out the CyberTruck as well.

First mover is huge. Lordstown had that potentially going for it (CyberTruck is ultra niche), but Ford could be selling thousands of their electric F-150s before a single Endurance is ready for sale. For the commercial fleet customer base, that may be a massive hole to crawl out of as companies they may have hoped to gain the interest of can begin converting their fleet with Ford.

How do you NOT see the F-150 electric as a major threat?"
2021-05-19 00:38:01,wallstreetbets,Um based on what?

2021-05-18 21:19:38,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I do. I don't think the Ford is due out until later next year. I've said before that LMC has shot, but has to execute. And I still believe they can."

Mpg ...."
2021-05-18 22:58:09,wallstreetbets,Ford needs the margins their trucks bring. Have you seen their debt? They can't afford sell at a loss to get market share. No way their ev sells for less than their ice and Lordstown is matching their ice price point so...
2021-05-19 03:39:33,wallstreetbets,"But it is still just a prototype at this point. They needed to show something, anything, to let shareholders know they intend to be a player in the EV truck wars.

You're are right that FORD is dominant when it comes to ICE trucks. No question. But it remains to be seen how quickly that dominance will transfer over to the EV side.

LMC is smart. They're positioning themselves to start out as a niche player with a plan to expand as sales and interest develop."
2021-05-19 03:57:33,wallstreetbets,"because i see it as normal competition?  i grant you they have a huge network already established and thats hugely advantageous, but again, supply wont be there for a very long time, time enough for LMC to become an established brand imo.  

they are also not limited to trucks on top of the skateboard and being smaller, can be more nimble when it comes to products like the electric pull behind camper they've already mentioned in development with Camping World and an EvRv down the pike.

the shift to electric is just beginning and it may not be the old names that monopolize the market as it was in the ICE markets."
2021-05-19 03:28:25,wallstreetbets,"Ok.

I'm not only relying on my instincts for judgement, but also my many years spent working in auto manufacturing at the plant level. 

LMC literally has all the components to be a successful EV startup. Of course, given the lurking competition and pre revenue cash burn, they must execute in a timely fashion.

CEO Burns, while not a PR maven, is extremely knowledgeable about the tech side of the business, imo.

I can't speak to exactly why all those employees decided to leave LMC (and I doubt you can either), but I can confirm it happens quite frequently in the auto sector. I've seen it happen over and over again at many levels. And you know what, the folks who replaced them managed to work out just fine. So if it's one thing that I've learned, it's that for every person that left and the thought they were irreplaceable, someone else stepped up and filled their shoes.

Investing in any pre revenue pure EV startup is a risk. But imo, you won't find one better positioned for success than $RIDE."
2021-05-19 03:40:53,wallstreetbets,"so instead of saying they got fired, they're disappointed.  nice spin."

2021-05-19 10:11:33,wallstreetbets,"True, but they also had a little coaxing from Hindenburg."
2021-05-19 08:37:44,wallstreetbets,"Ford burned me, bad. I am a 2013 F-150 Ecoboost owner. Loved the hell out of this truck, until the incident.

There's a brake recall affecting some 350k-ish vehicles. One day on the highway, with my 7yr old in the back seat, I have a brake failure warning light. As I exit the highway, the brake pedal goes to the floor. Luckily the exit was uphill and I was able to essentially coast down to 30mph and the light was green with nobody in front of me, literally best case scenario I could ever hope for, and I coast through the turn and take it wide.

Ends up being a $900 repair to replace the brake booster and master cylinder because brake fluid leaked through. Literally textbook example of the recall they issued. EXACT scenario described.

Their recall was deemed finished by court of law and my truck does not apply because it wasn't made in the exact factory at the specific timeframe that they claim this defect was limited to. Literally said ""your truck does not apply"" all because it wasn't in the timeframe of manufacture that they settled with the courts on to limit the # of recalls.

Ford can get fucked, in my humble opinion. :)

(Rewind to before incident and I would've been 100% in on an electric F-150)

Edit: nowadays, I try my best to steer anyone and everyone away from all things Ford. Scumbags."

2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Corn to the Moon I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I would like you all to understand, however, that buying call options on the Teucrium Corn fund that tracks a mix of Corn futures could lead to a profitable trade. It is an accessible and liquid way to trade the price of corn. Corn the US crop that has had its highs and lows over a long history but continues to have massive demand worldwide for a variety of uses and it is not slowing. Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. 
BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let’s run through these important things:
1. WHO grows corn?
The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 
2. WHO consumes Corn?
Well… it’s The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption 
3.WHO is the top exporter?
The US is the top exporter
4.WHO is top importer?
China is the top importer by far (Mexico was for years until this year and commitments for next year)
5. Risks?
As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. 
These include:
-Cancellations from china for old crop 
- Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. 
-The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let’s face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

2021-05-18 22:43:32,wallstreetbets,"""Corn is always interesting!"""
2021-05-18 23:05:58,wallstreetbets,Corn is going up because of multiple factors. Mainly everything is going up because soybeans are going up from limited supply. Option prices are also on the rise for those commodities.
2021-05-19 02:16:34,wallstreetbets,Stalks only go up right?
2021-05-19 12:20:08,wallstreetbets,E85 Ethanol for the win! Uses field corn so doesn’t threaten food security. But if Oil is suddenly squeezed then demand for E85 could rocket with the right news or info. Many vehicles in the US already support superior low emissions renewable E85 and E85 available at many locations where there were gas shortages

2021-05-19 00:06:33,wallstreetbets,"Yes the worry here is old corn demand drying up and cancelations would hurt, however I think that next year the supply will be tight with the exports being planned and accelerating from China which is a bit worrisome since then other countries will be squeezed of supply since the US didn’t need to supply them for years. And it’s a large % of total export."
2021-05-19 00:22:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah — China has taken the swine fever as an opportunity to overhaul their livestock production to be more modern, which requires in large part significant quantities of feed grain (mostly corn, although sorghum is used as well to a lesser extent).

There’s another risk that I’d bear in mind — Anhui has seen some covid cases cropping up correlated to the ongoing crisis in India, and another outbreak would be a real wrench in the works of their livestock production."

2021-05-18 23:45:06,wallstreetbets,"I consider myself an average lower middle class dude in his 30s, so here's my two cents, which I think you'll find apply to most of the US population:

1. IDGAF whether my burger is made out of real meat or not so long as it tastes good, so I'm totally down with eating a Beyond Burger or equivalent, **IF AND ONLY IF**
2. It is cheaper than a regular meat burger. Look I'm not eating cheeseburgers on the regular because I'm trying to spend a ton of money on food, and forgoing straws at restaurants and not eating threatened fish (primarily because they're expensive) is about as far as my concern for the environment at meal time goes.  If money was no object I'd be eating at a decent restaurant for lunch and getting a well rounded meal.Right now all of the non-meat alternative burgers are priced like their target market is the people who shop at whole foods and trader joes.

The prices might go down over time, but that's assuming they have room to go down, right now I'm not clear on whether the prices are high because the cost of production is high (in which case the question is can the cost be reduced) or if they are just scalping all the Trader Joe's crowd early adopters before other companies crowd the market.

**TL;DR - Average people aren't going to move away from their habits until you give them a cheaper alternative, they don't give a shit about saving the environment if its not personally beneficial to them, they have more pressing daily concerns. The for less wealthy and educated populations, that goes doubly. So in this particular case, I don't see an near-term case for corn prices to decrease. Long term, maybe, depends on supply and demand for food in general, which it will most certainly still be used as. Climate change will definitely have an impact on food supplies.**

Rant: Keep in mind this is the same population that makes even my best attempts at recycling properly mostly fucking pointless because half of them throw shit that's obviously not recyclable curbside in the recycling bins (air filters, scrap WOOD, food containers still full of food, etc)  and the other half don't even bother recycling anything.  You gotta spoon feed this shit to them, and that's going to take time and innovation or regulation."

What you spew about the environment is so far from the truth it's just plan wrong!!!! As for beyond meat... When u realize the saturated fat levels of those ""plant burgers"" are about as bad as movie theater popcorn (AMC represent) and literally cultured from embryonic cattle fetal tissue you may want to stop eating baby killing plant burgers and have the real thing. 95% of farms and farm land are carbon neutral RIGHT NOW! Not to mention those cow farts are a more sustainable source of energy (ready CNG production using methane gas from dairy farms) than the low to nothing value if grasses and even corn. Don't DD on me live life consider reading and learning something that college won't teach you.

Also I figured worst Pandemic in 100 years would boost the pharmacy business. Finding out it was one of Burry's largest positions made it way more interesting. Literally traded flat all year. Even with them crushing earnings it hovered around $72-75. Then I noticed it was trading green on these big red days the last few months. Almost like it was a safe haven for Boomer investors. But it was still dipping a lot during big green rebound days. Once they hired a new rockstar CEO, and it dipped to $69 I finally decided to hop on in late February. Got pretty lucky on the 5/21 expirys, but was super confident in the 8/20s. Almost sold all my 5/21's (had six of them) after checking Webull and seeing they only had a 5% chance of expiring itm. Decided to only sell half and see what happened with earnings on the rest. Luck was definitely a factor."

Might be a double in less than a year Wish - you know the company that is the butt of online jokes. they sell junks at a very a low price. well,  if you're paying $2 for a dress then it's going to be of low quality. I think they could be the dollar store of the e-commerce world.

let's get to the business fundamentals. Company is on track to do 3Billion revenue this year, which will be a 20% increase from 2020. Wish is trading at a market cap of 5.5B with 1.8B cash on hand and a price to sales ratio of 1.5. this is all from yahoo finance so you could verify information there.

The company went IPO at $24 dollars at the end of last year. it went high as 32 and now trading at $9. There is no other e-commerce company generating this much business trading at this low valuation. I think it doubles this year.

&#x200B;

position - $9.2 - 2.5k shares. I will sell at $20 plus. Not financial advice.

I admit there’s logistic improvements that can be made and better content/merchant screening and responsibility but it’s all part of growing pains. I’ve ordered from them before and all but one time did I receive the wrong item. And besides who said you can’t find dildos on amazon or eBay, doesn’t make it a scam. 

But I think wish is misunderstood, especially since the founders are so technical I think wish should be viewed more as a tech company than just e-commerce. IMHO Wish’s true value is its marketing algorithms and use of data & relevancy, and I think it’s really misunderstood because everyone associated it with Chinese crap. I mean who doesn’t own something from China?? But imagine how they’re able to achieve such revenue and GMV numbers, especially if they’re selling cheap crap from China which I can probably assume has a low transaction value on average. That means to make $2-3bn in revenue, imagine the level of volume of transactions on their platform and number of packages being shipped daily. This company’s technology can literally sell you shit from China over and over again and make billions in revenue with decent growth year over year. That, IMO, isn’t fuken easy. It’s not perfect since I know s&m cost needs to be contained, but it’s part of maturing their tech/business. But they prove their tech can sell “junk”, it can find the right buyers in the right country with the right pocket cash to spend on something from china. I know it sounds ridiculous but I mean if you can make billions by getting people to repeatedly buy crap straight from China, imagine what else they can do down the road. 

TLDR; IMO I think Wish has growing pains but they got cash and tech to improve. I think their technology is the real value here and e-commerce is just medium to show off how powerful their marketing tech is, which will open doors to more opportunities down the road."
2021-05-18 21:52:57,wallstreetbets,No one here supports you OP. Maybe that's the definition of undervalued. I see your points. My money's all wrapped up into PLTR. I know the rest of the masses feel the same way. Doubt the stock can go much worse. I mean 5 bil market cap. That's fucking low lol. There a bunch of companies over 100 bil market cap I've never  even heard of. It's not a bad trade. Short term I think you'll do fine especially if money starts pouring back into the growth sector
2021-05-18 20:38:36,wallstreetbets,Have you actually bought anything on wish?
2021-05-18 21:57:24,wallstreetbets,">I think it will pay dividend at these levels

What?"
2021-05-19 15:11:21,wallstreetbets,"Huge opportunity; haters gonna hate but here is the bull case:

WISH is not an e-commerce company - they’re a technology company. More than half their revenue is now in logistics and advertising. Wish provides a platform for merchants to sell products from more than just China. They do not make the products; bad products and bad merchants get delisted from the app. 

The average rating across Android and Apple app stores is 4.6 stars - almost 20 million reviews in total. 

They just hired a new executive chair that previously worked at Alibaba and Square. 

Alibaba and Amazon were both previously interested in strategic acquisitions of WISH. 

The company was privately valued at 3x the current market cap. 

The company has more than 50% of their revenue coming from outside the US; Europe is their biggest market currently, but WISH was the number one downloaded app in India for April and is seeing huge growth in Africa. 

They have $1.8 Billion in cash and no debt; they’re not currently trying to be profitable because they’re investing heavily in higher dollar spends for their monthly active users, higher quality monthly active users, logistics and their advertising platform. 

As a short-term trend, the stock has been heavily shorted and e-commerce brands have been rotated away from (see ETSY and POSH as examples); POSH hit a 52w low on the same day. I anticipate this hitting 2x the current price before the end of the year. Building good support at $9 now and small Green Day currently on a bad market Wednesday."
2021-05-18 20:44:07,wallstreetbets,"This isn't DD, the market cap isn't 50x revenue, no mention of short interest and not a single rocket emoji."
2021-05-19 10:27:01,wallstreetbets,"OP, the level of shit thrown towards you for this company, that can be solved by a good leader & a better workflow organization in Wish, is phenomenal.  
At the first glance, it might have some more downside, but it's for sure a good options play if you do deep DD.  
I wish I had access to option, for this play  (Slovenia, EU, we have shitty retail rules here)"
2021-05-19 05:21:12,wallstreetbets,Wish is a great option for shoppers who can't afford Aliexpress
2021-05-19 13:13:27,wallstreetbets,"""I never used wish"" 

100m people do 

""Its trash, nobody likes it from the reviews""

Well that 3B of revenue is realer that your chance to get laid this year

""I'll buy from Aliexpress""

You can buy from Amazon, Ebay, Etsy, Walmart, whereever you want. Nobody misses you. Wish is growing and theres nothing you can do about it."
2021-05-19 14:27:45,wallstreetbets,WISH needs a Squeeze now.
2021-05-19 16:38:40,wallstreetbets,"damn I bought this stock at 23 and sold at 30 and forgot about it, definitely gonna be in my portfolio"
2021-05-18 21:22:23,wallstreetbets,"Everyone here hates it.

I'll buy a hundred. idgaf"
2021-05-18 21:33:43,wallstreetbets,"Wish also sells scam products as well as counterfeit products. Wish needs to be shut down immediately, unless they can find a way to get rid of all of the scammers."

""HAGENS BERMAN, NATIONAL TRIAL ATTORNEYS, Encourages ContextLogic (WISH) Investors with Significant Losses to Contact Its Attorneys Now, Securities Class Action Pending
GLOBENEWSWIRE - 5:09 PM ET
SAN FRANCISCO, May 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hagens Berman urges ContextLogic Inc. (WISH) investors with significant losses to submit your losses now. A securities class action is pending and certain investors who purchased shares in the company’s December 2020 IPO or on the open market may have valuable claims.

Class Period: Dec. 13, 2020 – May 12, 2021
Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 16, 2021

ContextLogic Inc. (WISH) Securities Class Action:

The complaint alleges that ContextLogic’s IPO registration documents materially overstated the company’s business metrics and financial prospects. Specifically, the IPO registration documents touted ContextLogic’s exponential monthly active user (MAUs) growth, claiming its then108 million MAUs was a key driver of revenue growth.

In reality, by the time of its December 2020 IPO, ContextLogic’s MAUs had declined materially and the IPO registration documents failed to disclose this known trend reasonably likely to materially impact ContextLogic’s profitability.

On Mar. 8, 2021, Context reported disappointing 4Q 2020 and full year 2020 results, disclosing its MAUs had already “declined 10% YoY during Q4 to 104 million.”

Then, on May 12, 2021, ContextLogic (WISH) announced poor Q1 2021 results, including another 7% drop in MAUs to just 101 million, and the company slashed sales guidance for Q2 2021.

These disclosures caused the price of WISH shares to decline sharply.

“We’re focused on investors’ losses and proving ContextLogic (WISH) overstated MAUs and concealed known trends,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Company used a portion of the stock buyback program in Q1 2021 to purchase shares - averaging around $50 share price. 

Company share price dipped briefly to around $47 in February 2021

Significant short interest has been there for many, many, many months. Implying there may be significant short positions needing this stock to drop a lot in order to profit.

Like you said though, the TV contracts are set for now and they made their big move with the network going to Peacock. Those were their true money moves. 

I know they have tried to make some inroads in India so unless that pans out or they can get in China or some other Saudi adjacent country tough to see a significant increase in revenues outside of getting an even better TV deal down the road.

I'd put the product itself becoming hot and spiking attendance, merch, and advertising opportunities as the least likely unfortunately."

1D Timeframe

* If bears continue putting the pressure and we close 410-405 tomorrow the w seems to be forming and nearer to completion. To complete, we need a bounce around 405-410 bottom and to cross 417.86 range. I believe if we cross 417.86 we will see all time highs in the near future. Bulls have a lot of work to do though.

# 5/19 Outlook - Neutral with Slight Bearish Skew

* 410 really needs to hold for bulls. 
* We could see a battle at 410 as pointed out  at around 4/13
* If 410 fails look for 407.70 - 406.65 - 405 - 404.02
* Major support at 400. 
* Best case for bears is that we gap down below 410 and test for new resistance in the AM.

2021-05-19 08:24:37,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood is speeding up this IPO for obvious reasons.  They were lent money from Citadel and they are going to pay it back as soon as the cash clears.

The fact the government isn't stepping in to delay this IPO is all the evidence you need that they are in on it too. If that entire scam of shutting down the buys on only hedge fund shorted stocks isn't a RICO act fraud, I don't know what is.

Now the government and the issuing bank will also be conspirators in this fraud.

My advice is to never deal with the bank who will do their IPO.  Have a cancel your Bank \_\_\_ day and never buy the stock.

In reality, most retail investors already bailed from Robionhood and this is only an attempt to make whatever money they can before they are sued to oblivion.

If this were any of us with charges of fraud against us, we would have had our bank accounts seized."

~~Well this is just not true.~~

From https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/072104.asp :

>* The underlying equity security must be a properly registered NMS stock.
* The company must have at least 7,000,000 publicly held shares.
* The underlying stock must have at least 2,000 shareholders.
* Trading volume must equal or exceed 2,400,000 shares in the past 12 months.
* The price of the security must be sufficiently high for a specific time.

Coinbase had their options out after a week of trading due to all of the above criteria being satisfied."

2021-05-19 11:57:13,wallstreetbets,Didn't mention gambling in this post but I believe all investing is gambling not just RH.
2021-05-19 15:10:11,wallstreetbets,There's a reason why the average RH user does not turn a profit.  They allow people to gamble without understanding the odds.
2021-05-18 20:45:42,wallstreetbets,"I've been using RH for 3 years now and yeah it has service issues, all modern applications do. It's why the web is shit and modern software sucks.

The abstractions that are used to build modern software is so drastically different from what was done in the 90s, you're going to set yourself up for failure if you hold these standards today. Consider something as simple as keyboard inputs on modern OSes. There is a substantial delay compared to the nearly instantaneous action you would have had in 1990.

Now take this abstraction further. Spotify routinely has issues with their software updates. How often does aws-east1 go down? So much for five 9s. Github takes a massive dump monthly now. Comcast has taken down entire regions with cable cuts. Companies have compromised the entire adult US population identities. Give me an industry and I'll give you example of market leaders shitting the bed ranging from trivial issues to something as complex as solar radiation hitting a server rack causing a company millions in losses because some bit randomly flipped.

Sorry dude, but getting upset at a leap year calculation is just another convenience of modern software development. Yeah it sucks but it doesn't discount anything I've said. Unless companies start feeling repercussions from writing shitty software, which they won't, nothing will change."

There are also a lot of strategies that give you the perception that you're not actually gambling, like spreads, and there are definitely a lot of use cases (Deep ITM calls are very useful alternative to shares). If they turned their platform into free and premium plans, the only difference being that free plans have to pay commissions on options, I could see them pulling in a lot of revenue, and without a doubt, I would buy in."

Who knows, maybe we would've peaked there anyways, but at least it wouldn't have been thanks to shady business."
2021-05-18 22:06:58,wallstreetbets,"They didn’t manage their funds properly, this in fact was their second failure of exactly the same issue.

DTCC runs the clearing houses, in order to do business as a broker dealer you need to put up funds to insure the trading done on your platform.

They are glad to take the orders and profit from their order flow business but they don’t actually want to honor their commitments to their users.

A lot of brokers were forced to do the same thing yes but not to the extent (duration and number of securities) of Robinhood. Not to mention the fact that once again this happened before, so I’m sorry but I have zero tolerance.

2021-05-19 15:02:13,wallstreetbets,I remember reading on investopedia that about 25% of options buyers turn a profit.  The odds of selling an option profitably are far higher than buying an option.  Buying options gives you an unlimited ceiling though.

2021-05-19 05:15:46,wallstreetbets,"Countless brokers stopped orders on GME, AMC and other stocks due to increased capital requirements from DTCC. The big reason this narrative took off, that it was to save Citadel or something, was because instead of being straightforward Vlad said they didn't have liquidity issues, and that was probably because RH thought this would save face (they didn't want to admit they didn't have the cash). Only that it backfired."
2021-05-19 05:06:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes and that's still based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what happened.

Robinhood had no reason or motivation to bail out an unrelated hedge fund. A lot of people here *still* think that Citadel the market maker is the one that needed to be bailed out which is completely wrong, the MM was totally fine. That conspiracy literally just doesn't even make sense."

Tellurian expects to complete commercial agreements within the next few weeks sufficient to support the first phase of its Driftwood LNG export project in Louisiana, Executive Chairman Charif Souki said May 12. 

At the conference, Souki said Tellurian will start some construction activities this summer. In the interview, he specified those activities would include building roads and preparing the site for full construction. Tellurian expects to give a notice to proceed to contractor Bechtel in the first quarter of next year, Souki said.

In the interview, Souki said the offering has been very popular and, if Tellurian hits its target in the next few weeks, would be oversubscribed.

""I'm highly confident we will sell out,"" Souki said."

If you had a large stake in Haynesville, wouldn't making a deal exchanging mineral rights for Stake in driftwood make a ton of sense since profit on the water would be at least double what it is running operations in Haynesville?  XTO would have enough assets for a big portion, or Chesapeake could carry operations at full capacity.  These are just 2 possible acquisition possibilities."
2021-05-18 23:43:24,wallstreetbets,"They could, that was my comment about buying pdp. It’s still $$$. Jerry Jones is betting on Haynesville to be a purchaser of Comstock’s gas. It’s cheaper and easier to sign king term has contracts or a mix of spot than to buy an asset. Buying a haynesville asset right now that has the capacity to fill driftwood would cost >2x Tell’s market cap. They still haven’t FID’d the full project so a Meg acquisition isn’t remotely close to happening.

Getting gas to The facility is easy. And there’s a ton of LNG capacity in the area - Golden Pass, Sempra, Tell, Cheniere, etc. the issue is buyers which rebounded to a positive outlook over the past year with Asia."
2021-05-18 23:51:58,wallstreetbets,I figure between $2-2.5B for enough assets to supply driftwood for 25 years.  4-5 mtpa of driftwood output.  That's why an equity deal makes so much sense.  Asset for asset.  It would be a highly favorable deal for both parties.  It protects the other party from the risk of the HH dropping and provides a better revenue stream.
2021-05-18 23:58:04,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think it’s makes much sense to do that at all, economics. Chesapeake now has to divert capex/opex to an lng facility compared to them selling to one of the 5 facilities nearby? They don’t have expertise or $ 

I would put that as a <1% chance but you never know. We will see"
2021-05-19 00:04:16,wallstreetbets,I'm more interested in XTO/ Exxon personally. It's almost an ideal fit given Exxon is already in the LNG game.
2021-05-19 00:06:20,wallstreetbets,I’m very familiar with Exxon.. doesn’t make sense since Exxon is in Golden Pass. And asset for asset swaps with upstream/downstream really don’t happen.
2021-05-19 00:13:27,wallstreetbets,Exxon is a big player though and being spread between multiple export facilities mitigates risk due to unforeseen events.  There hasn't really been an opportunity for this type of deal before.  Tellurian is mixing the model up a bit.  I guess we will find out soon enough what they manage to pull off. It will be an interesting couple of months as we see the plan come together!
2021-05-19 00:16:13,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think they have a unique model compared to other lng facilities worldwide. I’m long LNG but I think there’s a ton of misinformation, inexperience with lng, and blind optimism about some of the players."

2021-05-18 21:35:15,wallstreetbets,"I think I can provide an explanation for the increase in SP (yesterday & today). After the Kyrgyz announced they'd be selling their shares in Centerra, there was no shares available to borrow (i.e. short). 

So I'm guessing that a bunch of HFs jumped in on the news and tried shorting the stock expecting a ton of new supply coming into the market. Of course, they didn't read any of the documents or do any research. Once the company announced they would prohibit the shares from being sold, it was game over and all of sudden the stock started going up and there were shares available to be borrowed again."

2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Are there WSB alphas? Academia says yes. I'm copying the abstract of the paper (Bradley et al. 2021 WP) -- don't blame me on that.

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

Original link to the paper: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3806065](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3806065).

4. Stop using social media.

5. Stop pursuing girls. Period. You only pursue when SHE shows interest and you’re interested as well. Besides that, block out all non-friend women in your life.

2021-05-19 02:43:10,wallstreetbets,"WHAT ATE YOUR MOVES Haha.... Seems most are lost.  I’ll throw some solid themes however you need to give them time to play out.  

LONGS: 

EUROPE: Quality European companies as a whole trading way cheaper to the US little exposure to tech. 

-European Banks; HSBC, UBS, Barclays,  NatWest even CS. 

-European Energy; BP, Shell, COP etc. 

-CHINA; their equivalent to the SPY the MCHI.  China already underwent a decent correction, set a new base and will start running again.  The ETF’s will work or pick and of the quality beaten up ones; JD, BABA, BIDU, XPEV

SHORTS;

-US appeal & department stores; retail (brick & mortar) was already on its deathbed pre Covid they sank even more but a lot of momentum money moved into those cheap stocks (STIMY).  That is not sustainable and many of them will lose 30-50% of their current value by the fall; ANF; M, KSS, DDS, PLCE, BOOT, BKLE.  

-ANY NEW IPO who went public in Nov to Jan.  Review when their lockup period expires and if it went public at a stupid valuation and somehow still up it’s a short.  DASH will be half of it’s value by the winter.  Other ones which are guarantee to eat it once they are no longer protected by founders and their investment banks are; UPST & PLBY.  

-PRICE TO SALES; any high flyer with a PS over 25X is a short in this market."

Connecting the two dots, we are likely to be in a global conflict in the next several years, if not months.  Looking to buy some of the defense contractor names as they ramp up for WWIII.

75F Cloudy with a chance of meatballs

I’ve been wondering a lot about the effect that our thoughts have on the world. If a bull is wrong about a SPY call, does he lose his horns? If a bear is wrong about a TSLA put, where do his teeth go? As I’ve pondered among the roadside, wandering down the beaten path; I have come the conclusion that the only way to be is to be a butterfly. A butterfly is always right in flight in search of it’s sugar water for the night, and when we know this; I think the next question is upon whose 🍆 with the 🦋 land?

u/enigmaticriddler, u/hellzangelz, u/memetron9000, u/sloptart69 or u/angrysc0tsman12?

BUT this is also part of the issue – after the whole “stock market drop” happened, it’s like I’m suddenly secondary! He’s determined to take advantage of the market while it’s down. I don’t think he’s even made $100 on stocks yet, but that’s clearly not stopping him. 


All he can talk about right now is “volatility,” “private equity” and “making gains.” Honestly, I’m pretty sure most of the stuff he’s been saying is just quoted from “The Wolf of Wall Street,” but I don’t wanna start anything by calling him out on it. 


The worst part was when we were in bed together. I was nice and cozy, and I thought he was too, until I looked over my shoulder and saw that he was on his phone the whole time. At 9 a.m., while PRETENDING to cuddle with me, this guy was buying stock, literally behind my back. 


When I called him out on it he just said “buy low sell high, baby” and gave me finger guns. Finger guns, in bed. 


I genuinely don’t know whether this is just a phase, or if he’s actually just like this all the time. I totally understand that money management is important, and I think it’s cool that he cares about personal finance, but this is clearly getting out of hand, right? Help!"

As they scale in size, complexity, headcount, and bureaucracy, organizations, both public and private, tend to develop misguided faith in ""untapped potential."" One is led to believe that complete devotion to the day-to-day grind of operational mediocrity in the name of getting things done is transient, and at the right time, one hopes that there will be room to come up with brilliant new ideas, and approaches.

I will make a guaranteed 8% annual income on the SPs and as long as the S&P500 doesn't drop further than 40%, I will continue to receive the income and receive the principal at maturity.

QuantumScape (QS) lockup period ends next week. QantumScape issued 240 million new shares for employees when they SPAC merged on 11/27/2020. These new shares were locked up for 180 days when they couldn't be sold. 

On May 26, the 180 days will have lapsed and employees will be able to sell their shares. Other pre-existing employee shares (89 million) also end lock-up on 05/24/21. I expect some employees will unload next week.  

The stock has been trending down since the Scorpion Capital short report was released on 04/14/21.

GameStop having a negative beta means that historically, the stock goes up when the market (SPY) goes down.

Take a look at this... [https://ibb.co/zQWp7v9](https://ibb.co/zQWp7v9)

GME has a capital-structure adjusted beta of -21.6, which is INSANE. This means that GME is RADICALLY inversely correlated to movements in SPY (companies typically have betas of -1 to 1...)."

Now, I know we get all weird about last performance, but damn: it’s like this stock has been in those numbers ever since it originally fell from grace. I ain’t selling either, but I’d be lying if I wasn’t exploring options in cc’s or something to lower my cost basis.

It included a lot of contracts (new and current), product development and expected release date. When BB gets good news, the stock goes down, this keeps on happening until their revenue picks up (which is what people are expecting). The price it’s at right now is just so good. You look at the market cap of crowdstrike as an example and it’s current revenue, the stock price for it is a complete joke. BB is building a lot of momentum and their products are the real deal."

2021-05-18 22:21:13,wallstreetbets,That'll do it!
2021-05-19 11:26:28,wallstreetbets,"At the time I wrote that, I looked at the options being traded on Fidelity for BB. A call option expiring on June 11th with a strike price of 9 bucks was worth between 46-54. Technically it's worth whatever you want to put it up for, but that was the bid-ask. 

But like OP mentioned, he was simply selling further out as opposed to just a few weeks, likely to not risk getting exercised. 

And I hate saying this because it sounds so lazy, but honestly just youtube it. Investopedia has great resources, but there's tons of youtubers out there discussing trading and options in detail. Just be cautious following anyone who's asking for donations or the like, they typically aren't there just to teach."

2021-05-19 00:02:36,wallstreetbets,There is lots of false things talked about the Church Of Jesus Christ I’m here. Maybe you guys don’t care but when I read what Russell M Nelson says on Instagram or a few of the other church leaders on Instagram I feel very good. Many comments on here are hateful and untruthful to very good people and a very good religion.

2021-05-19 09:56:33,wallstreetbets,GMErs already felt like a cult. Adding in the Mormon church doesn't help.

2021-05-18 20:27:26,wallstreetbets,All my homies hate the mormon church. Seriously we gay and those fuckers are evil.
2021-05-18 20:04:37,wallstreetbets,"This is a new article, but old news. I am wondering the purpose of this post. I know people trapped in Mormonism. One woman cannot leave and if she did, her exhusband would take away the kids from her. Nearly every politician in Utah is Mormon, as well as judges. She hasn't stood a chance in family court. Another woman doesn't speak to anyone in her family because they aren't Mormon. She converted and I don't know what the hell happened but it's as though she is in a cult."
2021-05-18 22:46:42,wallstreetbets,Fuck the Moron Church
2021-05-18 20:23:17,wallstreetbets,I had to scroll way too far down for people to be outraged that this shit doesn’t get fucking taxed. What a disgrace

2021-05-18 20:30:21,wallstreetbets,"I didn't know churches could play the stocl market. They pay capital gains tax on it of course though, right?...right?"
2021-05-18 20:40:37,wallstreetbets,Fucking paperhanded mormons.
2021-05-18 20:40:44,wallstreetbets,And people still don't think we need to tax churches
2021-05-18 20:48:56,wallstreetbets,"On a side note, that Church should be stripped of its tax exempt status."
2021-05-18 20:56:38,wallstreetbets,"I did too, why am I not on the news though?"

2021-05-18 22:02:58,wallstreetbets,Honestly weirdly good on the church. Not a fan of Mormons but you gotta give them credit that's one hell of a good return.
2021-05-18 22:04:27,wallstreetbets,These cunts should be taxed. Otherwise everyone should should just register as a religious institution and bank on their profits in the market
2021-05-18 22:07:44,wallstreetbets,"Good, are they (the Mormon church) willing to pay back all the money I was coerced into paying under the leadership of the church in my youth? Who’s with me?!"

2021-05-18 22:18:39,wallstreetbets,"I’m going on a GME mission to spread truth about appointed marriage, forced sex, and gains."

2021-05-18 23:22:54,wallstreetbets,"That’s cool but let’s not forget that the LDS Church hoards wealth and withholds help from even its own congregation which is taxed at 10% of their income. Those shares were bought with stolen money.

In short; love GME, not so much LDS.

2021-05-18 23:25:58,wallstreetbets,"Wow maybe they can give back some of the outrageous, ridiculous amount they take from their members"

2021-05-19 00:20:47,wallstreetbets,Why is a non-profit religious entity allowed to participate in the stock market?
2021-05-19 00:49:23,wallstreetbets,Mormon church makes 900% return on GME… spends it all on The Salamander Letter: Part II.
2021-05-19 01:20:29,wallstreetbets,"The Mormon church is more corrupt than all of big tech combined.

2021-05-19 09:41:12,wallstreetbets,"Great, now they can pay Huntsman his tithing back. There is no reason to require 10% from old widows and poor young families. They have so much money it’s staggering. Mind blowing. They still refuse to disclose their ledgers."
2021-05-19 10:26:35,wallstreetbets,"I live and work in SLC, UT. There is a huge homelessness population. The Mormons just announced another new temple. They shouldn’t claim to be Christian when they obviously aren’t."
2021-05-19 11:00:41,wallstreetbets,"Turns out the Mormon church was created for old perverts to fuck little girls

Founder Joe Smith would offer church leadership positions to men like Heber C Kimball with young daughters (Helen Mar Kimball; age 14), as long as they'd give their daughters to Smith to have sex with

The men would accept the arrangement because if they accepted, THEY TOO would be allowed to fuck little kids

Heber C Kimball ended up with 43 girls to fuck by the time he died. All he had to do is give up his 14 year old daughter Helen to be raped by a pervert until he died

Anyone who supports Mormonism fucking blows"
2021-05-19 17:00:43,wallstreetbets,Gotta love tax free churches playing the capitalist game and contributing nothing to our society
2021-05-19 09:11:29,wallstreetbets,"As a guy who spent the first 26 years of my life handing over 10% of every cent I earned to that church before realizing it was just a business selling warm fuzzy feelings and validation for bigotry, you’re welcome Mormon church. Don’t spend it all in one place. And preferably not on stacking the Utah legislature with more of your friends that will enforce your outdated beliefs on the general public."
2021-05-18 20:01:29,wallstreetbets,"For anyone who things that mormonism is anything less than a tax exempt, racist, exclusionary, extremist cult, read a book called Under The Banner of Heaven by Jon Krakauer. Sure, they bought a bunch of gme, with money they tithed from their brainwashed congregation, who wont see a single red cent returned to them in any meaningful way."
2021-05-18 21:10:41,wallstreetbets,"Guys don’t celebrate just because of their gains. The had a 12 Billion dollar nest egg that’s easily increased by the billions because of this. They don’t help people with their money, they’ve donated less than 1 million dollars to charity since the 80s. Despite their MASSIVE wealth they require 10% of all their members income and tell them that id they don’t pay then they won’t get into the highest level of heaven. They straight up tell poor people that if it’s between feeding your kids and paying the church, to pay the church. The Mormon church is FUCKED UP"
2021-05-18 20:30:10,wallstreetbets,Fuck those cult abusers
2021-05-18 20:33:49,wallstreetbets,Glad my tithing went to a good cause. That’s why I left the cult.

Pop Sci-fi like Star Wars and Star Trek. Anime such as Cowboy Bebop or a cartoon like Futurama (futurama sleepers anyone?). Babalyon 5. And yes, even Firefly. 

The Expanse takes the cake for me. Hell, me and one of my best friends (another big sci-fi nerd) tried S1 for a few episodes *and stopped* cause it was cool, but slooooow. Then HOTTDAMN does it start to snowball!"

Guess who’s divorced? And out of the church and very bitter? Both of them. All that money to train their clergy not to be dicks went to buying GME tho, so 👍🏻"

2021-05-19 05:55:44,wallstreetbets,"If you actually do the research into the Mormons finances, they do pay a bunch of taxes. 

They have the funds that they receive in tithing, that they use for running the church, costs of buildings, temples, etc. That is all non-taxed income.

They also have a TON of investment money outside of that like: the stock market, real estate, the nation’s largest cattle farm, and so forth that is all taxed. They don’t shield their money that is used for profit under their non-profit status.

It’s actually quite admirable considering how easy it would be to not pay taxes."

2021-05-18 23:40:52,wallstreetbets,"And why should it be? People seem to be misunderstanding something here, the church doesn't have an investment team doing any day trading or, any trading at all actually.

The $100B investment fund is the equivalent of a Massive 401k, they haven't strictly made any money because they still haven't sold any stocks except to bail out failed ventures, which happens rarely.

I'm sure none of us here would appreciate being taxed every time that our positions go up in value, the church is simply good at saving/hoarding money."

At the end of the day the church teaches people to be good, is family centered, and wants people to succeed. Be carful judging things you dont know much about."
2021-05-18 23:12:01,wallstreetbets,Uh they pay taxes in their business sectors but just like a lot of big businesses they skimp out on what they can

2021-05-18 22:34:04,wallstreetbets,"You realize there are 2 branches of the Church. The non profit side which isn't taxed and the for profit side that follows all tax laws as it should. The non profit one is called the Corporation of the Presiding Bishopric.

Edit: The Corp of the Presiding Bishopric is the NON-profit arm of the Church. Not sure what th for profit sides name is, or if it even has one. It extends over many sectors (stocks, real estate, agriculture, textiles, etc.) So it might just be a conglomerate of companies that operate under the umbrella of the Church. My guest is they fall under the Deseret Management Corporation that people got their panties in a wad about not too long ago."
2021-05-18 20:11:12,wallstreetbets,"It isn’t the church itself, it’s more like a separate business that fall technically under the church’s umbrella, and they do use that to build temples and fund works across the globe"

I'm kinda shocked so many people here are shook by this story. First, people are acting like the Mormon church is the only church doing this, just cause this story exists. The concern should be equally placed in their unknowing of what other churches profited of this (or be fine with it and angry that they themselves are taxed). 

Second, acting like DFK was smart af for seeing the signs but flabbergasted at the idea that a church, untaxed on capital gains, likely saw the same signs thru their investment managers and bought stocks at a low price like DFK, and sold at a peak price. For all we know, they bought back in on the dip."

I know Latter-day Saint Charities have supplied more than $2.3 billion worth of assistance in 197 countries, and maybe they haven’t spent much of that 100 billion yet because they want to have enough money to support all their members if something bad happens, or they are just saving so they never run out of money to donate 🤷‍♂️. Yeah it is possible the church is a fraud and they invest all the money to build a huge fortune and for no other purpose, but I don’t think that’s the case."

2021-05-19 11:21:57,wallstreetbets,"I'm not surprised at the bitterness or anger, but it is sad there is so little tolerance for people's faith and people believing different than you. It's so toxic. I would never hate on other religions or athiests. To each their own as long as you're not harming other people.

I think the issue for some is that they perceive the church as harming other people, so they feel the need to fight against it. Sometimes our cultural (not tenents of our religion) beliefs *can* cause harm to others, and we need to keep our eyes open to squash cultural beliefs that *are* harmful.

But when I read the scriptures and try to be more like Christ it makes me more loving and accepting of people different than I am. I find things in the church that I can't find anywhere else, and it's helping me be a better version of myself. They can hate all they want, although it is sad and just makes me think they are bitter or full of hate. My husband left the church last year and although he is hurt and angry too, he understands we all have our own beliefs and he's not going to try and tear others down."

2021-05-18 20:52:49,wallstreetbets,This is the right question and answer.
2021-05-18 20:56:36,wallstreetbets,"Well, it’s because yes"
2021-05-18 20:56:45,wallstreetbets,Amos because he is the best character.

2021-05-19 00:10:13,wallstreetbets,His serial killer stare and lack of empathy turn me on.
2021-05-19 01:10:38,wallstreetbets,"because of his delicious cookies?

2021-05-19 01:12:32,wallstreetbets,"I was about to write ""that's a weird way to spell Alex"" but dang it you are right it's Amos. Badassery and loyalty made man."
2021-05-19 01:46:47,wallstreetbets,It certainly isn’t Holden. Amos is the best.
2021-05-19 02:36:19,wallstreetbets,"Came here for this comment! And how excited are you that Amos does a podcast with one of the authors....Ty and That Guy.

Wes Chatham is a national treasure!"
2021-05-19 02:44:02,wallstreetbets,"I honestly hope the guy didn't do too good of a job that he becomes Amos.  Like, without a seriously different look, I can't take the actor and the character apart... he is cast that perfectly and acts that perfectly. 

I had a somewhat different character in my head after reading the first book but then watching season 1 it solidified it for me. He is just so fucking tuned in.  Intimidating sociopath, yet has such good range of emotion with his face, posture, eyes with a hint of broken sort of kindness that he hesitantly displays before smoothly snapping out of it and going back to sociopathic survival mode, yet that's just so fluid and unforced.  Just so much nuance in there that doesn't kill the scene and you can get a vibe for the struggle he's been through without it being spelled out.  

I'm not a fanboy of many characters that aren't cartoons but I think I would legit stumble over my words if I met him IRL.... kinda like in this post.

Whoever cast him needs to be in charge of any and all recasts (Martian Space Cowboy-there has to be someone that doesn't look drastically different and can act as well to fill that play that type of character).  Arjun was such a horrible recast and I hope that wasn't by the same person.

Edits:  Added words and stumbled over more."
2021-05-19 04:01:54,wallstreetbets,It's actually Camina.
2021-05-19 04:24:54,wallstreetbets,My favorite characters were the donkey balls.
2021-05-19 05:40:25,wallstreetbets,The manchild guy?
2021-05-19 06:10:00,wallstreetbets,"It’s Amos. Everybody’s favorite character is Amos, and you can’t convince me otherwise.."
2021-05-19 06:24:35,wallstreetbets,"It's Alex. 😭😭😭

Amos reminds me of when I was younger and angry.  He's really well written but watching him is slightly painful."
2021-05-19 07:39:29,wallstreetbets,He's consistently charming hon
2021-05-19 07:55:22,wallstreetbets,No love for me?
2021-05-19 08:19:11,wallstreetbets,"He’s even better in the books, somehow. Not being a hipster, love the show.

If anyones curious about the books but doesn’t want to commit to reading them all, there’s a short story/novella about Amos’ origin story called *The Churn* which is just a wonderful read (it’s on https://3lib.net)"
2021-05-19 08:49:45,wallstreetbets,I dunno but Bobby Draper is a close second for me.    I love how she says mahs.    Amos is truly awesome though.     Will the dumb apes take over the navoo and turn it into the behemoth though ?
2021-05-19 08:50:08,wallstreetbets,Yes.

2021-05-19 10:48:29,wallstreetbets,Gunny and the pilot are pretty good too.
2021-05-19 11:50:29,wallstreetbets,It’s Avasarala cause fuck you

2021-05-18 21:00:57,wallstreetbets,Named my first born Drummer because of the love I have for that show.
2021-05-18 20:32:20,wallstreetbets,I think my favorite aspect of the realism in the show are the space battles. The scene where railgun slugs puncture through the crew's hull was bonkers. Also the scene where plant dude forgot to stow the gear and it almost killed them from all the high G maneuvers
2021-05-18 21:12:11,wallstreetbets,"Right, like when they pour a cup of coffee on the ship and it spirals down! So many cool science references it feels like such a grounded series."
2021-05-18 21:26:18,wallstreetbets,I've probably introduced about 15 people to this show and I'm proud to say every single one of them finished it :3
2021-05-18 23:16:09,wallstreetbets,I'm still on season 2 but I enjoy the history flashbacks like the Epstein drive. Great world building.
2021-05-19 02:53:51,wallstreetbets,This is not where I expected to find my fellow fans but I’m not unhappy about it. And I agree re: believable sci-fi. It’s hard to go back to the usual space battles after seeing The Expanse done so well. If only everyone else would now step their game up.
2021-05-18 20:13:27,wallstreetbets,Hope it doesn’t go pear shaped for ya
2021-05-18 23:33:32,wallstreetbets,"I am so glad I got past ep 3, then the story actually gets going"
2021-05-18 22:49:31,wallstreetbets,It’s Medina Station now
2021-05-19 01:01:24,wallstreetbets,I love Alex but he's so inconsequential to almost all the story beats going forward. He represents the heart of the crew and the character did that well but it can be found elsewhere or just not be that big a deal since the real value of it would be lost without the inner thoughts being able to be portrayed on tv.
2021-05-19 07:38:50,wallstreetbets,It’s not hard. It’s Amos and you damn well know it!
2021-05-19 03:52:02,wallstreetbets,"They got renewed for a 6th final season.
It will obviously be alot different from the final books but atleast we get a conclusion."
2021-05-19 12:03:42,wallstreetbets,No I got you. But the LDSS is the like “Her Majesty’s Ship” of the Mormon church in the show.
2021-05-18 20:39:53,wallstreetbets,"A shit ton of people on Reddit bought shares at that price and are now expecting the second coming of our lord and savior the short squeeze.

And it would all be tax free... since our church is the one investing it.  Church's always say that they want to ""give back to the community"".  Well, ours will be the only one that does."
2021-05-18 20:44:09,wallstreetbets,Can't Blame them for being smart...  they are just doing what we are trying to do.
2021-05-18 20:37:01,wallstreetbets,They also spend a lot more on humanitarian efforts than you do.
2021-05-18 20:41:13,wallstreetbets,They own a massive Megamall too. And members HAVE to pay the church 10% of their income and the church barely does any humanitarian work at all. They mostly focus on indoctrination of more money paying members though missions and building new temples.
2021-05-18 20:38:17,wallstreetbets,"This one time I was high and created an animated show in my head where there were legitimate Space Mormons. They have a ship in the shape of Jesus Christ t-posing that flies through space looking for other ships to rendezvous and dock with, to then get aboard the other ship and say “do you have a moment to talk about or lord and savior Space Jesus Christ?” And when the main character spots a flying giant Jesus while on an adventure in space, says something like “Shit, it’s the Space Mormons, they’re gonna request to dock, engage antimatter thrusters” or some shit like that idk I was high and that was a year ago and I’m high right now, but I really thought I invented Space Mormons lol."

2021-05-18 20:04:03,wallstreetbets,"No, brother Aesthetically, we're not evading taxes. We're simply not taxed because we're a religious entity. Tax evasion implies loopholes and dodges. Religions are explicitly exempt in the tax code, so the fund not paying taxes is US tax code *working as designed and intended*"

Notably, it exerted a deciding influence on [Proposition 8](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html). Hardly surprising someone from the sub that coined “FD” and incessantly hurr durrs about ghey barez would consider that charity."
2021-05-19 09:35:21,wallstreetbets,"Nope. They spend none of this hoard, except twice: bailing out the mall project, and bailing out Beneficial Life during the 2008 financial crisis. Not one penny of the $100 billion+ has ever been used to help the poor and needy, etc."

2021-05-19 01:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Not Mormon anymore, but I think it’s important for people to remember that the Mormon church does not pay its leadership in anything other than travel and some living expenses. Almost all of it goes towards philanthropy and religious....stuff"
2021-05-18 21:00:49,wallstreetbets,"The Mormon church claims hoarding money is a religoous obligation. ""Preparing for the Savior's second coming"", as if what a God wants is an incomprehensibly big stock portfolio."
2021-05-19 10:22:50,wallstreetbets,"This goes back into church history. In the early 20th century the church was very nearly bankrupt. Most of the leaders, referred to as General Authorities, are very successful (it's varies: some are former businessmen, surgeons, professors, etc). Anyway, as I recall hearing it, one of the GA's was a successful investor and established the church's portfolio in order to revise the deficit.

From our point of view, the church and the money belongs to Christ, we are just stewards. Self sufficiency is also a core cultural belief. So it's important that it be spent wisely and not superfluously and that the church be self supporting. The amount of money the church has in reserves is not public information, so any articles claiming so are just speculative."
2021-05-18 21:40:20,wallstreetbets,Seems like the only thing that mormons have kept believing over time is acquiring money . Everything else gets changed as they see fit
2021-05-18 20:19:12,wallstreetbets,I would argue that this church doesn’t really follow God...
2021-05-19 05:45:15,wallstreetbets,"Christianity used to be very adamant about the charging of interest being a sin, but capitalism is more important than Jesus I guess so they stopped following that part.

The one single aggressive thing Christ ever did was beat up moneylenders, and everybody knows he did it, but it seems like we just decided ""well Jesus was wrong about that""."
2021-05-19 10:17:13,wallstreetbets,"I mean, Jesus literally says in the Bible that you should pay your taxes, but I don't see churches going out of their way to follow that teaching, so something tells me most of them don't really care about their activities being ""ungodly"""

2021-05-19 02:20:33,wallstreetbets,"Yea but its not like anyones flying around in private jets. They spend close to a billion on humanitarian aid alone, and use their assets to continually fund the meeting houses, activities, education programs and facilities for 30,000 congregations around the world, over 150 temples, and 880,500 students through various levels of education. The downside and benefit of a centralized church is world wide funding is provided by a central organization. Assets produce assets to allow this operation to continue.

The local clergy is volunteer, the head leadership receives 120,000 a year which is less than an independent midwest methodist pastor. But its a full time position so its not like they’re freeloading. No one is running around in a mercedes because of the church’s financial operations. This isnt a Kenneth Copeland sort of ordeal."
2021-05-19 03:59:50,wallstreetbets,"Except no individual person profits from this... the lds church doesn’t pay their clergy and the people who make money decisions have no access to the money themselves. The church does employ people but those people are contractors and accountants and such, the people who make the decisions don’t get any of the money. So I’m ok with it."

2021-05-19 03:44:07,wallstreetbets,They literally give like 0.4% to charity. The same whistleblower who revealed their billion dollar fund also revealed this. Unfortunately they are NOT a charity and that's just a part of the big con they are perpetuating for their members and yourself. It's what gets people to fork over their money and think they're doing a good thing rather than growing a mega corporation.
2021-05-19 03:46:15,wallstreetbets,"The end to this is not going to be a good one, I'm afraid. People are far too conned by this cult. America is statistically getting more secular as the internet exposes this cult, but I don't think it'll happen fast enough. I predict the mormon org will soon use its power to start eliminating bad information about them online when the internet becomes monetized."

2021-05-19 12:29:41,wallstreetbets,"One thing I’ll point out is that the Mormon church actually does pay tax on their stocks. They have a company owned by the church known as ensign that deal with the stocks and runs the portfolio, and because ensign isn’t a religious organization and is a investment firm, they do pay tax on stocks. I only know vague details but I know it’s funded using profit from other businesses owned by the church like the news company’s or thrift stores in Utah, and obviously it’s own gains. This is because iirc using tithes or donations would get the church in a very shifty situation legally as that would bring to question whether they legally qualify as a religious organization. Main thing I don’t know is whether any of that money goes to temple building, charity and relief efforts, etc."

No, that’s reserved for “building the kingdom”, i.e., buying real estate and filling glorious $50million temples where they can baptize the same dead people over and over again - you know, all the things Jesus said you should do.

The Mormon church was created for old perverts to fuck little girls

Joe Smith would offer church leadership positions to men like Heber C Kimball with young daughters (Helen Mar Kimball; age 14), as long as they'd give their daughters to Smith to have sex with

The men would accept the arrangement because if they accepted, THEY TOO would be allowed to fuck little kids. 

Heber C Kimball ended up with 43 girls to fuck by the time he died. All he had to do is give up his 14 year old daughter Helen to be raped by a pervert until he died

It also says that it's easier for the camel to go through the eye of a needle then a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Weird, they seem to be ignoring those statements."

2021-05-18 23:43:52,wallstreetbets,"Joseph smith married over 33 women, the youngest of which was 14 and was impregnated, polygamy was a founding tenet of the faith and fathers and apostles had the god given right to marry off their children to be starutorily raped and impregnated by older men under threat of eternal damnation. Fundamentalists are forbidden from watching tv or newspapers to keep them controlled, and believe the sins of homosexuality and sexual intercourse with a woman of the african race to be punishable with death on the spot. In more modern times, the entire organization is controlled by 15 elderly white men, as women are forbidden in positions of authority within the church. Women also need to have 7 children before they are granted an automatic pass into heaven, any less and their husband gets to decide if she gets to enter heaven. Any lgbt inclinations are punishable with excommunication, and while the LDS church has a net worth of over 100 billion dollars, homelessness in their capital city of salt lake has one of the countries highest homeless populations. Mormons also recieve a higher proportion of state benefits than the average, in some polygamist fundie spots like colorado city, its as high as 8 dollars in government benefits for 1 dollar paid in via taxes. I could go on and on. Visit /r/exmormon for hundreds of these stories.

Mormonism is a dangerous, sexist, racist, exclusionary death cult that has no place in modern society."

S01E01 is great for quick exposition of this universe, but there's so much background detail you're bound to miss cool things the first time. S01E02 is a slog, all there to fill out characters we barely know. S01E03 picks things up a bit, but its still more a character and exposition piece. 

But then S01E04 hits, and you see what the show is capable of at its best. Peril, surprises, action, great CGI. And after that, its a smooth ride right to the midpoint of season 2 (and end of the 1st book)."

2021-05-18 20:07:49,wallstreetbets,"The missionaries pay their expenses, not the church.

From PBS.org:

'Missionaries are expected to cover all expenses of their mission; many Mormon children start saving for their missions when they first get an allowance, at 6 or 7 years old. Many young Mormons also work after-school jobs to save for their missions.'

And the temples are private; apparently not even all Mormons are allowed inside: 

'Upon completion, temples are usually open to the public for a short period of time (an ""open house""). During the open house, the church conducts tours of the temple with missionaries and members from the local area serving as tour guides, and all rooms of the temple are open to the public. The temple is then dedicated as a ""House of the Lord"", after which only members who are deemed worthy are permitted entrance.
Temples are not churches or meetinghouses designated for public weekly worship services, but rather are places of worship open only to the faithful where certain rites of the church must be performed.'  -Wikipedia"

Even though I disagree with a lot of what they do and preach, in an odd way it makes me proud to imagine future generations taking on such an adventure. 

My ancestors were those who lost family members crossing the plains as pioneers in the 1800s and the idea that they would strike out into the stars is oddly encouraging to me. 

As an aside though, the expanse completely got the Mormons’ reaction wrong to what happens in that story. They would not be victims, they would come for blood and throw down anyone trying to screw with their holy trek. 

Militant missionaries would become a thing."

1. If you could hie to Kolob
In the twinkling of an eye,
And then continue onward
With that same speed to fly,
Do you think that you could ever,
Through all eternity,
Find out the generation
Where Gods began to be?

2. Or see the grand beginning,
Where space did not extend?
Or view the last creation,
Where Gods and matter end?
Methinks the Spirit whispers,
“No man has found ‘pure space,’
Nor seen the outside curtains,
Where nothing has a place.”

3. The works of God continue,
And worlds and lives abound;
Improvement and progression
Have one eternal round.
There is no end to matter;
There is no end to space;
There is no end to spirit;
There is no end to race.

4. There is no end to virtue;
There is no end to might;
There is no end to wisdom;
There is no end to light.
There is no end to union;
There is no end to youth;
There is no end to priesthood;
There is no end to truth.

5. There is no end to glory;
There is no end to love;
There is no end to being;
There is no death above.
There is no end to glory;
There is no end to love;
There is no end to being;
There is no death above."

Shitty part is. This fund they have has never been used for charity. Only two transactions have come out of it. To build the city creek mall ($1B) and to bail out their for profit life insurance company. It’s the most wealthy religion on the planet. Well over $400B in assets. All tax free. It’s a cult to the core.

2021-05-19 00:41:30,wallstreetbets,"Nope. 

They are exempt from taxes and can even write it off as a loss if a church member does it and then donates it to the church. 

Say you own appreciated stock worth $27,400. If you sell it, you may pay $7,400 in capital gains tax, leaving you with $20,000 to give to your church as a tax donation. Instead, you can donate the stock directly to your church. The church then receives the full $27,400 value – and you write the full $27,400 value off on your taxes, too!"
2021-05-19 01:14:14,wallstreetbets,The market is up 210% over the past ten years. If the church had $50b invested in 2011 they could have spent $55b over the past ten years and they’d still have $100b. So maybe you don’t know what you’re talking about?

They encourage you to save to pay for it but they will if you dont have money my apartment in one area was $2,500 a month) it also pays for the free copies of material the church gives out to people, App development to access learning material online, the website, Satellite broadcasts, family history, and other things directly related to the church and teaching people about God. Every month we have fast offerings (once a month we remember those in need by fasting either not eating 2 meals, not using your phone for the day, or whatever is a sacrifice to you to remember those who have not.) You can donate to the ""fast offerings"" which is optional and not required at all by the church but is the fund that the church uses to donate to charities or pay for food for others or donations for natural disasters which the church has donated i think over $2.3 Billion so far all paid for by the members donating to the fast offering fund, and they give out around $1 Billion a year total for combined annual humanitarian and welfare aid expenditures.

2021-05-18 20:11:21,wallstreetbets,"Go to LDS Charities’ website, the church’s charity organization, and find how they get their money.  
It took me some time, but I found it looking back at an end of the year report.  
  
Members pay 10% of their income to the church- tithing.  
On the tithing slip there are other optional categories. You can put money there if you want, but it does not count towards tithing. The two we need to know about are “Fast Offerings” and “Humanitarian Aid.”  
The money in “Humanitarian Aid” goes to LDS Charities. That’s where they get their money. Donations. 100% from donations. The church does not give any of their excess to charity.  
  
Even funnier is the “Fast Offerings” box. Once a month, members fast. Not eating for two meals or so is the general practice. Then you put the cost of those two meals into “Fast Offerings.”  
That money goes to the Ward (that local area’s congregation). The Bishop of the Ward uses that money to help people in the ward who need assistance.  
So again, the organization of the church spends no money helping it’s members.  
  
Not to mention that only higher up leadership get paid and the church does not pay for missions, which last two years, are required for men, and can include elderly couples. And guess who runs much of the church’s visitor centers, educational centers, etc?  Missionaries."
2021-05-18 20:18:11,wallstreetbets,"I wrote a comment about it above somewhere that goes into detail, but LDS Charities is the organization that the LDS Church uses for charity.  
LDS Charities gets no money from the LDS Church. They get their money solely from donations. LDS Charities admits it itself in its annual reports.

Edit: I'm a dumbass and wasn't aware that Ensign Peak Advisors are a registered 501(c)(3) organization, so they aren't taxed for any capital gains or income, so they do in fact get away with this tax free. I'm still pissed about it, but now more at the system that allows this to be possible and not necessarily at the organization itself."
2021-05-18 20:13:03,wallstreetbets,This is 100% accurate. Recent influx to WSB has unfortunately brought some of the general edgy Reddit cringe contingency with it as well.

When they travel they travel in a private jet, stay in the nicest possible hotels and have a private driver wherever they go. That's pretty fucking lavish. They also don't pay taxes on any of that income. 

So, that's 2x the average american household income if they paid their own expenses. The average american has 6k a year in flexible spending after they've paid their expenses. Since all expenses are paid and that money is just for them to use however that makes it so they make 20X what the average american makes. That's pretty fucking lavish."

They have very little actual charitable giving and the number they produce include monetizing the time its members help out.  Very little is known about who is actually benefiting from the huge storepiles of cash.  They do use substantial funds to buy and develop real estate.

My most charitable interpretation of what they are doing is literally hoarding cash for a second-coming of Christ.  No one in leadership is living extravagantly, and aside from some lucrative development deals, no one seems to be making too much money off the church.  They are like Smaug with purpose, though that purpose is kinda apocalyptic"
2021-05-18 21:21:58,wallstreetbets,Lol Mormon missionaries have to pay $10k out of their own pocket to serve a mission for a church that's worth over $100 billion. That should give you an idea as to how willing they are to part with that hoard of cash

[Deseret Management Corp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_Management_Corporation). I'm not sure if there are more for profit corporations or if this is the only one."
2021-05-19 03:20:15,wallstreetbets,"A couple of corrections. First of all, the corporation of the presiding bishopric isn't actually called that anymore, there was a reorganization a few years back. BUT, it's easier to keep referring to it as that for clarity sake, so I don't blame you.

The corporation of the presiding bishopric includes all of the church employees that get paid, but the organization is *not* for profit. Church employees are people like mechanics, programmers, and travel agents, not preachers. Preachers/leaders are part of the ecclesiastical side, which means they're volunteer and don't get paid.

Then there's the investment side of the church. It's still not for profit, but it pays taxes and isn't legally considered a non-profit. The church teaches financial literacy classes where they tell their members to have an emergency fund, live on less than they make, avoid debt, and invest for the future. This is what they say the investment arm of the church is for, they argue that it would be hypocritical and irresponsible *not* to maximize tithe-payer money and save for emergencies. Saying that they have a 100 billion dollars investment fund makes it seem absurd, but it's ""only"" about 7-10 years of expenses for a huge worldwide church. 

Having that fund has meant that they've been able to give a lot of financial aid (and trust me, they give a lot) even during Covid when tithe-payers didn't pay.

We already know they exert themselves into politics when given the chance, like putting money into Prop 8 and directing their members to vote no for Prop 2. That's just the beginning.

Here's a list of the top 20 charities. The lowest on the list donates 10 times more then the church. https://www.forbes.com/lists/top-charities/#4e23b8055f50

Can you give me some biblical instances on that? I can share several about the love of money and the rich man getting into heaven. It's funny, it's almost like they preach something different then the bible and book of Mormon. 

So, let's go in on that $40 million donation yearly. The church annual income is 14 billion. That's 0.3% of their yearly income. So, that means the average american would only have to give $120 a year to match them. Seems a bit short of the ten percent required by members."

This is an article that talks about the Church's financial history and current financial situation.

And excerpt from it about the for profit aspect:

>Today, the Church’s business assets support the Church’s mission and principles by serving as a rainy day fund. Agricultural holdings now operated as for-profit enterprises can be converted into welfare farms in the event of a global food crisis. Companies such as KSL Television and the Deseret News provide strategically valuable communication tools.

The ""Church's mission"" is vague to those who aren't familiar with the Church's teachings but suffice it to say it's essentially to help spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ and help others when they are in need.

And a small list of 5 things that tithing and other donations are used for:
> Tithing funds are used to support five key areas of activity:

>1. Providing buildings or places of worship for members around the world. We have thousands of such buildings and continue to open more, sometimes several in a week.


>2. Providing education programs, including support for our universities and our seminary and institute programs.


>3. Supporting the Church’s worldwide missionary program.


>4. Building and operating nearly 140 temples around the world and the administration of the world’s largest family history program.


>5. Supporting the Church’s welfare programs and humanitarian aid, which serve people around the world — both members of the Church as well as those who are not members."

They could be the ones selling you calls when they know they’re about announce high yield rates and your investment will crash. That’s dangerous and they have little to no oversight to prevent it from happening. I can definitely see the dangers in mega-cult church corporations especially with how incapable the public seems to be at seeing through smoke and mirrors and how easily media can be bought out, but they can still be controlled, and educated people can still deny it and protect themselves.

I would be wary of teaching anything that goes against the plain language of the scriptures, but would welcome others to their beliefs.

I don't get how an eternal cycle of creation would differ from that of what I set for above.  If the eternal cycle is: birth, God, repeat, then that is no different from the doctrine in the bible, book of mormon, doctrine and covenants, and pearl of great price.  I don't think there is room to teach that the doctrine goes against this.  Even the Gospel Principles manual (a class I taught consistently while serving a mission) has as its final chapter a lesson on exaltation.  This is inarguably the doctrine of the Church."

2021-05-19 12:09:55,wallstreetbets,"God *has* prepared a way, His way being the church is financially stable enough to do so. Back in the days when those teachings were being taught they didn't have nearly any of the things or responsibilites we have now. It's a completely different atmosphere. They're given a yearly stipend so that when they are off traveling across the world their families are taken care of. They don't live in the lap of luxury and they're definitely not getting rich off of it. And any wealth they do have came from their professions or books they write.

Tithing is a spiritual law, not a physical law. God does not need our money. He gives us the commandment to pay tithing to increase our faith and keep our focus on Him. Obedience brings blessings. A lot of our commandments are for us and our *spiritual* growth. And almost all if not all of the Q15 have struggled financially at some point in their lives. I just listened to an Elder Holland talk, thst he gave many years after the fact, talking about his struggles as a young father, financially and emotionally. They remember. They understand. They are not heartless leaders sitting atop their towers basking in their wealth. They are constantly among members, visiting members, and staying with members from *all over* the world, wealthy and impoverished.

And to be honest, President Nelson and the other people who were in wealthy positions could have a way more comfortable and easy life without serving, so to give of their time *is* a huge sacrifice and a way that they go without.

Yes, the local leaders of the church give exorbitantly of their time without financial compensation and it's very difficult. I don't have any response to that, although as a Young Women president, the thought of being paid or wanting to be paid or thinking I deserved to get paid because of my service never even came close to my thoughts. I don't serve for the money. Bishops and stake presidents though are crazy busy, I don't know how they feel about wanting compensation.

A janitor would be nice. I have found the very few times I have cleaned the church, it helps me realize what it takes to maintain those buildings and gives me more respect for them and helps me treat them with that respect. And the ome time I was able to clean the temple, I absolutely loved it and was glad I had the chance to do it. Something given freely with no sacrifice is hardly ever appreciated.

The problem with people who have left the church (not saying you have just in general, just people I've read ITT) is they tend to forget that members are more focused on the spirtual aspect of the church and not the physical. The church is a spiritual entity navigating a physical world."

Maybe you're talking about an investment in me - I will admit, that one will pay off. Not so much in ""business development"" but definitely in my own personal development. I developed some excellent skills, became fluent in another language, and came back to school more dedicated to learning and helping others. After my mission I got better grades then before due to this discipline and have received $18,000 in scholarships. I'm glad they chose to make that ""investment.""

Yes, he “married” a ton of women. By marriage we mean either civil marriages or what we call sealings, which are purely spiritual, so the “all eternity” deal. We don’t know how many of those marriages were simply for eternity or were marriages in the typical sense, but the youngest of them, the one you’re referencing, was only for eternity. 

Polygamy wasn’t a founding idea of the church, but introduced a bit after to the apprehension of Joseph and most of the church, which is why it was introduced slowly over time and more often than not in secret. People knew yes, but only a select trusted few at the initial introduction of the doctrine was able to practice it. 

Idk where you got the married off and rape part, bc reports from government officials who went to Utah made mention of how close and positive the culture was in Utah. Funny enough, it was one of the first communities that gave women a higher role in many aspects, one of which being consent. Women weren’t forced into polygamous relationships, and had all the right to leave if they wanted to. 

We can consume media, idk where you got the idea of tv or newspapers. 

As for African Americans and punishable with death? What even is that? I can guarantee you nobody has ever believed that en masse, and if they did, it’s a false doctrine or a screwed up culture thing that people don’t agree with nowadays. 

Women have positions of authority, search up Relief society and Sunday School general presidencies as well as read the Family Proclamation to the world, in which women are equal partners in relationships and all other aspects of life. 

Idk why the church being run by 15 men? So what if they’re white? They’re chosen by God through revelation. There’s plenty of people who aren’t white that hold leadership positions in the church, two of them being  Ulisses Suares and Gerrit Gong. 

We don’t need to have 7 children, legit have never heard of that in my life. False doctrine. 

LGBT inclinations are fine, but acting upon them isn’t fine. Just like how acting on lust before marriage in a straight relationship is also potential for excommunication. Not to mention that marriage is ordained between a man and a woman before God, that’s not even a church thing, it’s a Doctrinal thing that’s lasted centuries. 

The church has plenty of resources to help the homeless, not sure on what exactly they’re doing to combat it but they don’t just sit idly by and do nothing. Not to mention it’s not the churches job to fix every problem in the world. The church is simply a church, and can’t do everything. Not to mention that a lot of it is funds for a rainy day. The church teaches self reliance, so it makes sense a big organization such as itself would have funds for that. 

Pretty sure the aid thing is fake news, i certainly don’t receive any more benefits than normal.

We also don’t practice polygamy either, some other break offs of the original faith do but not the main group. 

And false, false, false and false. Anything else?"

For me it's more about the fact that a ""church"" can continually demand its poorest members pay 10% of their income to maintain full membership in their church while they get to invest billions of dollars (their own members dollars, mind you) in the market without paying a single cent in taxes. I know a lot of those members, many of which are on welfare, yet part of being in a cult means you get ostracized if you don't do everything right, and it's really shitty that the church can be so blatantly two faced without legal consequence. That's why the system is fucked."

He was on a team that that developed the first heart-lung machine that allowed open heart surgery using a bypass machine. He did perform the first open heart surgery in Utah. He sure as hell didn’t invent heart surgery. He most definitely is not considered a pioneer in pediatric heart surgery. Not to say he didn’t have an impressive career but let’s not lie and overhype someone.

https://kslnewsradio.com/1919566/church-humanitarian-aid-numbers/?

Also, the Mormon church is worth 100 billion. They spend 1 billion. That‘a not very impressive when they make members give up their saturdays to clean the chapels or use the senior missionaries to tend the temple grounds and etc.


ETA: I was friends with a dude back in middle school whose dad was called to be the mission president. He came back for senior year and didn’t sound like they struggled at all. Homeboy went to international school, had helpers around the house, and lived in a huge ass mansion all probably funded by tithing money. 🥲

ETA again: 15 million members? I just want to point out for all the people who have never been associated with this church, they record you as a member once you get baptized. However, even if you stop going to church the next day, you’re still counted as a member unless you send a letter to the headquarters asking them to take your name off the list. So, they probably had 15 million members at one point, it might be less."

I'm impressed about the same amount as I am impressed with Donald Trump.

2021-05-19 03:49:54,wallstreetbets,"I don't mean to argue, but I genuinely don't understand the notion that non-profits can't save or invest. 

To use a less polarizing example, I remember not long ago the wikimedia foundation came under attack for asking for donations when they had savings that could have ran Wikipedia for a couple of years. Personally, I feel like it would have been irresponsible for wikimedia to wait until they were out of money before they asked for donations. If anything it made me *more* willing to donate to Wikipedia, knowing that my donation was going to be budgeted and managed wisely. And, when you're saving millions of dollars, it's not like you just park it in a savings account.

Other than personal opposition, I don't see why the same shouldn't be true of a church. There's even scriptural president in the parable of the talents. Obviously there's things that church's shouldn't do with their money, I just don't see why investing should be one of them."

As a member of the lds church I can fairly confidently say that a huge majority of our members lean right, easily 80% of our members in Utah. 

Funnily enough, one of our leaders in April suggested that members may need to choose a top 10 list of things you want a candidate to support or want to change, and vote according to who meets the most important ones. He also very specifically said that it may also mean voting for a **different party than you normally affiliate with**. It was kinda a subtle message but I got a laugh out of that one."

Others agree there *have been* other worlds and that man is *as God once was* but believe that there isn't more than one world like ours progressing at this time; rather, that it is more of a *sequential* cycle.

As for the existence of aliens, those that subscribe to the second point of view would agree that God the Father is by definition an alien, but that there are not *others* because the Celestial beings/angels/messengers from outer space are originally from Earth (or, you could argue, from Heaven, but if we're going there, one could also say that that is where *we* are from as well, prompting a clear, no-nonsense definition of what exactly qualifies as an ""alien"").

In any event, the belief that there are, right now, *aliens like us* or *other worlds like ours* is what I am claiming to not be *doctrinal* but *speculative.*"

Also, the notion that kids were distinct from adults in their capacity for reason was something else that was relatively new in the 20th century. Hence, you have 80 year olds fucking 15 year olds going through puberty. It was about as common as a Confederate's love for ass fucking their pigs because it was less dirty than being caught with a black person, which was clearly a win for states' rights and what the KKK spent 90 years conducting acts of domestic terrorism to protect.  


Basically the US was a cess pool, as you'd expect for being the degenerate refugees of Europe's multicentury war on the poor and civil rights in general. If any of that makes you feel icky, then puts on your portfolio, because clearly you don't have the stomach to play in meme stocks."

you find a monkey in your pantry one morning, jamming fistfuls of sugar into its mouth and leering at you. You scream, it keeps eating sugar. You shake a broom stick at it, it moves out of reach and keeps eating sugar. You step across the threshold of the door and it throws the sugar bag across the room, and bolts out the window laughing at you.

The next day, there's 3 monkeys. They all know the game, too. You scream, you shake the broom, you threaten to step in the room, but the second you step in, they wreck up the place and run away.

You board up the window, the monkeys pry it off. Things escalate until you start hiding your food elsewhere and propping the door to your pantry shut with a chair, until they start coming into the house.

Eventually the monkeys get so bold they come right up to you. You grab it by the head, give it a firm spin, and spike it on the fence outside. No more monkeys."

They also lie to their members, making them believe that this is going to be used mainly for charity. I know that's certainly what I was told (amongst many other lies, so many lies).

They use a mere 0.4% of it for charity, as was also revealed by the whistleblower that revealed the billions hoarded they kept hidden from their members knowledge. If someone told me a charity I contributed money to used 0.4% for actual charity, I'd think of it as a huge scam. That's what this is.

Then they continue to break the wall of church and state by exerting their influence, like we saw with Prop 8 and Prop 2. They do this with their cash or by telling their members how to vote.

In short, their entire conglomerate runs like a corrupt business taking advantage of the tax code in a Trumpian way.

They give .4% to *other* charities, like their contributions to the red cross. That doesn't count any of their humanitarian aid, bishops storehouse expenses, disaster relief, etc. I think any charity would look poor if your metric was how much they gave to other charities. Having been involved in some of the welfare for my local area, I promise it's significantly more than .4%.

>Then they continue to break the wall of church and state by exerting their influence, like we saw with Prop 8 and Prop 2. They do this with their cash or by telling their members how to vote.

The church has pretty clear political neutrality policies, and doesn't give money to political campaigns or tell members who to vote for, they only express opinions on referendums that have religious implications (like prop 8). In fact, they've been pretty clear recently that there's no political party that is ""correct"".

>In short, their entire conglomerate runs like a corrupt business taking advantage of the tax code in a Trumpian way.

I don't even know what to say to this. Trump (likely) committed tax fraud by lying on his filings, and used bankruptcies to his advantage. I don't get how any of that is analogous to the church.

2021-05-18 22:42:03,wallstreetbets,Lol. More classic Mormon manipulation.
2021-05-19 12:53:39,wallstreetbets,"These were both extremely reasonable assumptions at the time. Cool that he called it, though!"
2021-05-18 22:22:57,wallstreetbets,"Aka cognitive dissonance ;) trust me, I know all about the methods mormons use to make themselves feel better about all the messed up stuff around them."
2021-05-19 15:34:14,wallstreetbets,"I never said they did anything illegal. Just because something is technically legal doesn't make it not shitty. My whole point is that they shouldn't be allowed to do that shit at all while claiming tax-exempt status. In fact, I don't think they should even have tax-exempt status in the first place, nor should any religious institution (and that includes *Muslim* religious institutions, since you seem so concerned about them for some reason).

Also, I don't keep track of my charity donations. I donate as much as I can whenever I can, but I don't keep track or claim it on my taxes because I don't donate to get a fucking tax break. I also don't make very much money in the first place, so I donate my time much more than the very limited amount of money that I have. I rescue dogs with health and/or behavioral problems (I currently have four, as well as a rescue cat) and I pay for their extensive medical bills as well as take on whatever special care th y might need. I also volunteer for the local dog park, humane society, and habitat for humanity. I am also active on the Nextdoor app so I can help my neighbors in need whenever I am able to do so. 

Lastly, I never ""overpay"" my taxes. Despite claiming 0 allowances and withholding at higher single rate even though I am married, my husband and I still owe every year. I have no idea why, but like I said I don't make a lot of money so I can't afford the $200-$300 to pay an accountant to look at them, and the internet has been no help. I owe about $700-$900 every year, and I pay it in monthly installments because I can't afford that much money all at once. Not sure why any of that is relevant at all though, but you seem intent on deflecting from the subject at hand in any way you can."
2021-05-19 11:58:14,wallstreetbets,Obviously you have been researching on the wrong websites. You have literally no idea what the church is about. Try checking out churchofhesuschrist.org for starters

2021-05-19 12:31:16,wallstreetbets,"It’s complicated because it doesn’t make sense lol. 

I don’t have faith in the religion, i have faith in God. 

If you take your entire perspective on Confirmation Bias and Conscience being the Holy Ghost, it fits really well with your experience. I don’t think those were promptings, but your conscience telling you to leave a situation in which you didn’t find yourself comfortable. 

Bruh honestly, describing the Holy Ghost is probably the most difficult thing for me to do and considering i still wrestle with the whole “is it me or is it God” kinda deal i don’t feel like I’m most qualified to talk about it."
2021-05-19 12:46:55,wallstreetbets,"I apologize, i pretty much call everybody man or dude regardless of gender in typical situations. 

It’s plastered legit all over the place. God loves all His children so we do to. The second great commandment is to love others like ourselves. If that’s not being done, then our goal to try and become like Christ is either slowing down or not going so well. 

As for Natasha, i feel for her since she’s trying to do what she feels is right and hope things go well. I don’t feel like I’m educated enough in the whole situation (I’ve read about it before our convo) to make comments, and it doesn’t help that most news sources are painting it in a negative light. 

I don’t think leaders excommunicate people who are in line with the thinking that Christ is okay with Gays. I would think He’s okay with them considering the doctrines He teaches. Not even to mention the story of the Woman caught in Adultery. He was worthy to cast a stone at her as taught in the Law of Moses but still didn’t. 

Idk, they chose to “excommunicate” her for a reason that may not make sense to most of us, but i don’t think it was done because she believes gays are loved in the sight of God."
2021-05-19 12:24:22,wallstreetbets,Hey hey! That’s #3! We are getting close guys!
2021-05-19 11:42:31,wallstreetbets,"Idk what the issue is here. Polygamy was filled with sealings or marriages that may or may not have had sexual acts done in them. That’s the gig. 

Now did Joseph handle the whole thing poorly from accounts we have with his wife? oh yeah. You feel bad for her, but there’s a reason why there’s a section of the D&C addressed to her talking about Plural Marriage. 

Sorry to hear you had a rough falling out though. 

Idk how me not leaving and aggressively attacking current members means i need to grow some balls ? I did my research lol. Over a years worth of it, which is why I’m still a member. 

Try non biased sources next time."
2021-05-19 11:48:25,wallstreetbets,"You mistake my meaning. 

I stay away from opposing opinions 90% of the time related to the church because rarely is it ever constructive or not surrounded in half truths or forced perspective into making it look 
much worse than it actually is. 

As for me being wrong, i have. Multiple times. Still do to a point. Here’s the thing, I’d rather be wrong in a religion that teaches good than be wrong outside of a religion that I’ve already proven time and time again to not be what people like you try to make it out to be. 

I looked up dissenting information for over a year in my life, and it’s disgusting. You could barely call their “research” actual research since it was so shrouded in opinion and negative assumptions."

Fucking hell. People ARE opening shorts. They're opening shorts at fucking 30,40,50,60,70 and 80% borrow rates because they fundamentally understand the stock is GIGAINFLATED. They can hold their short position for *years* and still profit.

2021-05-18 20:54:20,wallstreetbets,"Approximately 450 million outstanding and 417 million float. Hence, why actually squeezing to very large amounts is not an ideal setup for AMC. Too many hands own it and can dump. Citadel has a decent position. Wish them the best though and I hold only for the potential jump in price. I’ll be surprised to see it reach much higher than 100 since the naked shares on it aren’t very large in proportion to the outstanding."

2021-05-18 21:17:05,wallstreetbets,"I was just throwing a number. Who knows? It’s based on probability. Probability based on the setup is it doesn’t squeeze and will be contained. Options were setup and bought for hedging AMC when it hit 20’s where it was shorted down. Would probably require a recall, recount, reverse-split, etc. for it to even get to the 100 that I threw out. Still a great ROI. Just not a short squeeze and I wouldn’t bet on it reaching 100. With GME, then I’m not going to extremes. But, do I believe 5K, 10K, up to 100K is possible. Based on the float and number of outstanding, naked shorted estimates, shorted ETFs, and that the business model with Executive change-up is a big determining factor. This play has been going on for at least 1.5+ years. AMC float is just very big with a lot of share holders. They just had a 17 million block announcement at 14.20."

In regards to comment ""Shady"" are you referring to an individual who No longer has any say, on day to day decisions?

or

Are you referring to every hard working individual globally, who has worked on and with Nikola Motors as a whole, helping this company succeed.


Penalizing a company for someone elses personal choices is a mistake and wrong.

An example to your comment a family member  has committed a shady act and the whole town has declared you and your entire family as shady and not to be trusted, because of one family members.
You and your family are kind, wholesome, good people. Why should you be Penalized for a family members shady choices.


Understand my point young man.

Give this company a fighting chance to succeed.

2021-05-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BYND Meat HALAL CERTIFIED TODAY [Here](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/isa-furthers-its-partnership-with-beyond-meat-with-the-certification-of-the-new-iteration-of-the-beyond-burger) is one of the many articles stating that as of today BYND burgers are now HALAL certified.   


If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event."

Plus it helps the market share bynd and impossible have along with bynd's take out/restaurant deals. Plus they are always doing outreach. They got Kim K doing recipes. They just announced they'll be doing summer bbqs outside of Walmart. They did that trial run of bynd chicken with kfc. They're constantly doing outreach and product promotion.

That said,

NO, Halal is A LOT MORE THAN slaughtering in the name of God and letting the animal bleed out... It's supposed to be the Superfood Technology that will leave present day's quantum computing in the dust. And it's not free... just because Muslim authorities do not profit from Halal as aggressively as Rabbis does not mean it's not a business. It just mean Muslims are no match for Jews when it comes to commerce... Money $$$.

I say you haven't been eating halal all your life... And that Allah will not give credit for those observing PARTIAL halal like what Muslims have been doing since the inception of Islam.

Abstinence from consuming pork alone does not make one Halal because there is no such thing PARTIAL Halal.... Religion is either Black or White, there is no grey area (Actually, there are plentiful... stay tuned).

Having said that, I urge all good Muslims to ditch Halal and live like true Children of Allah. Now go sample some yummilicious bacon, chow down a Red Lobster, and gobble up a Peking duck, (etc... millions more yum yum).

After all, PORK IS GOOD FOR YOU (so is seafood)

Pork is a rich source of certain vitamins and minerals your body needs to function, like iron and zinc. It's also an excellent source of high-quality protein. Minimally processed, lean, fully-cooked pork eaten in moderation can provide certain benefits when added to your diet.

2021-05-19 14:23:58,wallstreetbets,Halal and kosher ( I presume that's what kashrut is ) is the same thing when it comes to slaughtering method. There's a slight difference in animals with kosher prohibiting hooved animals I think?
2021-05-19 14:30:52,wallstreetbets,">Halal and kosher ( I presume that's what kashrut is ) is the same thing

Yes, Kashrut = Kosher.

Kashrut is the law, Kosher is the adjective... Just like ""Halal"" means ""permissible"", not the law itself. 

So, Muslims do not have their own Law, they must therefore refer to the original Kashrut Law, if you wanna keep Halal. 

That said,

Now you either follow Kashrut Law to the last word, or you're wasting time practicing ""Partial"" Halal becos you'd get no credit for ""half-hearted"" practice. Its like you can't called yourself a Muslim if you only partially believe in Allah and his private messenger.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout."

For me, avoid watching channels that those criminals use to manipulate and cover for those criminals. This to send a message that Apes uncovered you and business as usual is not this time.  
  
For me it is about avoid doing what the Aggressors hunters are used to steer the prey to do which is panic, take a small profit and sell moving to another stock. Well this may make short-term profit but it is what the hunters need. Then when I go to another stock and get trapped, I should not scream for Apes help, just lick the wounds and go as I played by the hunters rules.

2021-05-18 20:42:13,wallstreetbets,But... we made money...
2021-05-19 08:57:59,wallstreetbets,"After a 50% jump from last month? If you truly trade on the daily chart, you're going to be losing a lot of money. 8 straight green days of gain, and you're concerned about yesterday where it STILL finished higher than the previous day."

2021-05-19 10:55:27,wallstreetbets,I didn’t cause TA is pure BS. Anyone who believes it can even help predict a stock movement is retarded. It’s like fortune telling hahahahaha
2021-05-19 10:59:53,wallstreetbets,"I mean it’s a shit over valued stock but no one.

it’s easier for shit overvalued stock to say overvalued than it is for an undervalued stock with good fundamentals to go up

Congrats tho"

2021-05-18 20:31:27,wallstreetbets,"Im also in Canada. Only buy in if you are okay with some risk of course. However, imo, the payout potential is totally worth it even with fees & whatever. (Not financial advice lol just my opinion)"

2021-05-19 01:07:04,wallstreetbets,Sorry that's a stupid question it's like I'm in grade school learning vocabulary all over again
2021-05-18 20:39:31,wallstreetbets,"If you buy shares you lose nothing atm, if you buy options obviously u pay attention to the theta and vega before u buy, just buy on a dip and consolidation n keep rolling the options out"
2021-05-19 12:19:41,wallstreetbets,The point of technical analysis isn’t to predict the future - it’s to determine where you have the best probability of success.
2021-05-19 00:01:27,wallstreetbets,Whats the inverted MC hammer referring to?
2021-05-18 22:43:30,wallstreetbets,Ape Strong gether!
2021-05-18 23:42:43,wallstreetbets,So if I buy $200 worth of amc shares converted to CAD + commission fees you still think I’ll walk away with decent profits?
2021-05-19 00:13:18,wallstreetbets,So what does one do in the these times hold?
2021-05-19 04:08:41,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I wish I could award you
2021-05-19 12:28:53,wallstreetbets,I know wtf TA is and it’s 100% bullshit. It’s impossible the stock market is completely unpredictable. Shits like fortune telling hahahahaha
2021-05-19 00:08:20,wallstreetbets,"Oh, if it’s not yet obvious from the chart, let me explain. There is a Doji figure in the candlestick TA, called ‘a hammer’, whilst the candle resembles a hammer in its shape and structure. This one is considered to be a reversal pattern, meaning that after such a candle a trend reversal should follow. MC Hammer is just used as a punchline here"
2021-05-19 05:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Do your own research and make your own decisions, no one here is at any liberty to provide you proper financial advice."
2021-05-18 21:34:42,wallstreetbets,Friday will not be too late.
2021-05-18 22:59:37,wallstreetbets,Will do. Friday you might even get a Dip to buy in on
2021-05-19 00:10:29,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I just google MC hammer and it was the upside down black guy, now i get it😂"
2021-05-19 07:09:43,wallstreetbets,"I know, asking for others thoughts never hurts though"
2021-05-18 23:40:06,wallstreetbets,How do you know for sure?
2021-05-18 23:41:45,wallstreetbets,If I do end up getting a dip to buy on I’d be happy about that. I won’t make much profit on $200cad worth of amc shares but every bit helps and I can’t afford to throw too much of my paycheque into stocks anyways so I keep it in small amounts I can afford to possibly lose
2021-05-19 11:53:47,wallstreetbets,This..THIS is the best comment ever. Lol thank you
2021-05-19 07:15:35,wallstreetbets,You were clearly asking for financial advice
2021-05-19 03:13:00,wallstreetbets,"It's the stock market. No one knows ""for sure"". Honestly you don't sound confident at all and if you're that concerned about 200$ I wouldn't go for it. Buying these stocks is basically gambling. High risk, potentially high reward."
2021-05-19 04:34:45,wallstreetbets,its already down 5% pre market so maybe you will find a good price
2021-05-19 10:46:32,wallstreetbets,"Well either way, I asked for opinions and ultimately i can decide what I do with that info🤷🏼‍♂️"
2021-05-19 07:08:03,wallstreetbets,"I’m well aware it’s a risk to play in the stock market, I just want to be as smart about it as I can to minimize the risk as much as possible"
2021-05-19 09:05:08,wallstreetbets,Probably shouldn't be looking for advice on reddit then...
2021-05-19 11:03:41,wallstreetbets,if your starting point to those answers is asking random people on the internet...you really shouldn't be doing this.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

2021-05-19 05:08:38,wallstreetbets,"Why are you assuming there must be a grand conspiracy where some other company is ""behind"" the shorting?

They were retail-focused, in-person businesses during a pandemic. Shorting them is just common sense."
2021-05-18 20:32:00,wallstreetbets,"Say a company only has 100 shares, $10 each, so 1k market cap. Someone short sells a share and collects $10.

Then they issue 400 new shares. Now there is 500 shares, $2 each, same 1k market cap.

Right away, is $2 less than $10? Easy money for shorts who profit the $8 difference.

But wait, there’s more! Let’s add in huge recent growth, say 100%. Then there would be 500 shares, $4 each, so 2k market cap.

Again, is $4 less than $10? Shorts still profit the $6 difference.

Stock dilution is bearish."
2021-05-18 20:59:23,wallstreetbets,True

2021-05-19 07:38:44,wallstreetbets,"Lmao you got a mention by CBS in this garbage article. They posted the chart with ""fucker"" and the bear getting fukd. Hilarious.       

Edit: forgot link, duh.     

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/"
2021-05-19 00:51:38,wallstreetbets,"For the new to catch up on the AMC/GME story, here is my 2 cents interpretation of what I see.   
The Stock Market is basically a Prey hunting trapping game and as I see it goes like this:  
The big guys goes on scavenger hunt and then they zero on a prey target. The company needs to have some interest in their stock. The hunters start to throw foods on the road to attract the prey to dip their toes in the water and have some confidence their shares are growing.  
Increasing the share prices would increase investors (prey) attraction to invest more.   
Then the hunters ask the Market Manipulators to create huge amount of Put options and Call options to make them gain/loss neutral and cover their tracks.  
  
Then the Hunters lend the synthetic shares they created and the short selling begins not at high volume yet, because the goal is to keep selling as much as investors prey keeps on buying. The Prey collects the sold money to grow even larger and more powerful to replicate the plan with other stocks and continue to repeat the trap.  
  
Once they decide that the prey eat enough shares and trapped, hunters flood the market relentlessly of those synthetic shares that appears legit since it is backed by Option put/call. Certainly, some borrowing of the real shares take place as well as that is also part of the trap cover-up to deceive the prey.   
  
Part of the decoy system are Media Bashers, false news manipulators, buying and selling outside the market “Blackpool” out of shore tradings, fake analysis, bought/bribed regulators and authorities etc.   
  
In short, provide unlimited supply to achieve the target goal of the most favored outcome of driving the company to bankruptcy or at the most to purchase the borrowed and synthetic shares at a much lower rate than the fund collected selling them. Then the regulators may fine the Manipulators a very tinny percentage as a “punishment” which is tinny skin out of the entire prey.  
  
So historically, the smart prey try to interpret charts and fundamentals which basically buys when the enemy is looking the other way or when the enemy is setting the crumbs on the road to trap the prey then as soon the big trap gets closer, sell and sheer the profit.   
  
Another Prey coping tactics has been is to buy options as much as they can afford to lose and for a short chance.   
  
Another prey coping mechanism is that when they get trapped to return bleeding with broken hopes accepting that this time they miscalculated and go on with less goals in life.  
However, this time is different. The prey decided to turn into Apes and bond worldwide against their aggressors. Apes now start eating the dangled food the aggressors left on the way with courage. Apes realized all food anywhere can be turned into a hidden trap and cost them to get hunted swiftly and decided to focus on one GME and AMC trap food the aggressors set for them. Now the prey trapped the aggressor not as a form of becoming a new aggressor, but as a duty and a right to defend one’s own life, family and belongings against the aggressors even if it means bankrupting the aggressor and even jailing them as they have committed robing and stealing in the trillion of wealth against the majority of the people of good well everywhere.   
  
Because the aggressors have done it over and over with great success, Apes must tough it out and stand their ground against the aggressor with resolute.   
  
Now, for me as long as the aggressors are covering with new synthetic shares is not the squeeze at all. The real squeeze is when the manufacturers of the synthetic shares are forced to purchase them at any price the seller determined and born those synthetic shares and every borrowed shares there is. Uncovered borrowed share is a naked share that dilute the market and loot investors.  
  
This is my opinion and not any financial advice as all I see is a game of hunting"

Sorry but those days are done with the meme stocks running wild. They might have days of some good gains but not zooming like it did. But good luck on it. I hope you loaded more AMC on the dip lol. That money so you should of bought puts for the open today... I did. Made 19k and done for the day. Looking to buy calls now for mid swings. Kinda easy playing the market if you follow trends and charts. All the best to you and hope you make that money!!!

2021-05-19 18:41:59,wallstreetbets,"Look at it this way, pre covid stocks were above $20.  There is minimal risk for high reward. Worse case this doesn't spike, wait a year and stocks back above 20 anyway."

2021-05-18 20:31:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah I ended up liquidating just about everything buying shares and calls for Friday. Nearly shat myself this afternoon when the price started dropping but some of the info I've seen on here since is making me feel a little better about it. Still a little nervous though lol
2021-05-19 08:46:55,wallstreetbets,"Lol, well done. Funny stuff."

2021-05-18 23:19:23,wallstreetbets,"Well go on then, what’s your rebuttal to those technical indicators usage?"
2021-05-18 23:56:42,wallstreetbets,Not the response of an intellectual IMO
2021-05-19 00:39:31,wallstreetbets,"Oh, boy, here we go! I’m sorry Bobby (or David), but with the honourable mod on my side, I am finally allowed to fry your ass here. Look. The TA is a method of analysis, that allows to filter out the market noise and to look at the things unbiased to the market sentiment, especially when such a sentiment is distorted. Remember when there was a bullish craze throughout the beginning of COVID, and everyone was talking about its insignificance, and how the stonks will only go up? Well, the market crash happened afterwards, and many fundamental and sentiment based ANALysts got burnt. While simultaneously TA indicators were shouting that the market was overbought, and the correction is due. Similarly, when everyone was panicking in late March 2020 and the general sentiment was grim, the indicators gave a hint that the many markets were oversold. Anyway, TA is a method, an instrument - and it depends on how you use it. If it doesn’t suit you, there is no need to run around and shout at everybody, criticising their instrument of preference. You’re the one looking stupid and discredited in this case. Nothing personal pal, just my opinion"

FOMO is real."
2021-05-19 17:13:22,wallstreetbets,Lol AMC has been around $10 for the last few months and you wait until it spikes to 15.45 to push all in? Make sure you sell as low as possible for it to come full circle....
2021-05-18 20:23:43,wallstreetbets,Stupid to be buying at this level.

2021-05-19 00:37:08,wallstreetbets,So 15.44 is the peak? I'll plan accordingly. TY.
2021-05-19 03:10:30,wallstreetbets,"Yo, so if his shares are in margin, does that mean fidelity could sell if they deem it financially sound?"

2021-05-19 07:16:29,wallstreetbets,Well you'd be right more often if you didn't buy above resistance. 9/10 times it's going to correct itself back down to the support line and  then 9/10 times it's going to go back up to resistance again. This is just basic probability.

2021-05-19 03:20:47,wallstreetbets,"I day trade as well but never trade on margin. As in trade without borrowing on margin. And I make sure I have zero balance on margin. My concern is giving my account fidelity the right to sell if my margin balance goes below 25k which is the min in order to be on margin. Now because of this they can and have the right to sale my shares when ever how ever. Am I right in this assumption? So let's say worst case scenario, AMC goes sky high can they fidelity sale it, just to fuck with me before it hits max altitude. Not advice just wondering."

2021-05-19 11:34:59,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the research. I'm long Aug. calls in UWMC. Really interesting story here, and according to ShortSight, UWMC currently has a 19.87% short float. There are only 108.154M shares floating, so a potential short squeeze can happen very soon.  


Additionally, UWMC may be included in some index additions in June. We'll have to wait and see."

It says the max cost is $20. Is that how much I would have to pay for it period? Or would I really be paying $900 for it?

People exercise their calls when their calls become in the money (stock price is less than the stock price). I meant I could exercise 3 to 5 of my calls. The rest I would be selling for others to exercise or sell.   
If the strike price of the call is below the stock price at expiry, the call would become worthless."

Mark to market losses are kinda like telling the IRS you shouldn't pay any tax this year because every friday night you didn't win the lottery, so you estimate you lost $758M this year."

2021-05-18 23:21:20,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure their risk management team has been phoning it in while drinking and coke binging.
2021-05-18 23:34:02,wallstreetbets," As it should be.... 

# Mentioned from the start. GME and AMC were the two most shorted stocks in the market. GME: 140% AMC: 85%

and now... the beginning of something brand new. Better market conditions and still need to start deep diving into these shorts that are always available. It's crazy times in this market when you know the floats have both been abused heavily."
2021-05-18 23:40:27,wallstreetbets,It'll probably be a tax write-off for them.

2021-05-18 21:29:10,wallstreetbets,"I actually doubt this. The governments position that banks were too big to fail actually made sense, in a way they were. I still think they should have let them fail but I also understand why they bailed them out. Hedge funds won’t get bailed out. They are not an important working part of our economy.  They are parasites, sucking off capital.  No politician is going to want to tie his/her name to bailing out hedge funds, nor could they easily justify it."
2021-05-19 05:47:07,wallstreetbets,If you owe the bank 200k it's your problem; if you owe the bank 200 billion its the governments problem.
2021-05-19 12:06:25,wallstreetbets,Ya but it’s a vicious loop because the taxpayers cover the shorts but then the profit on share price increasing gets taxed by capital gains when you sell lol

2021-05-18 20:06:25,wallstreetbets,"People bought the stock because they think the stock is shorted to hell. And it was shorted over 100% of the shares. People think that a lot of these big investors still have their same short position. They also naked shorted Gamestop because they thought it was a sure thing they were going out of business. The same exact thing they did to Toys R Us. This is how over 100% of the shares are shorted. So people think it's going to cost them a fortune to buy the shares they need for their short position. It's really expensive to buy GME right now and they believe there aren't even enough shares to cover all the shorts, because it was over 100%. Because of all this, people think the price is going to skyrocket once all the shorts have to cover, retail owns it all. 

These people bought gamestop stock because they want money. How could you be so naive to think people bought GME because they loved the store and just have to save it lol. You sit there and say the main priority is saving the store, and if they make some money, great. You have to be young to think like this. Just wait until you are on your own and you don't get all your money from mom and dad. You'll realize pretty quickly that you would take the money, not the store. I know you'll deny, I can tell you will, but you said that people would give up the money if it means the store is saved. Jesus people are slow on this site."

And no....no i wouldn't take the money because i hated gamestop well before i started investing years ago my self. Gamestop is a shitty company who has taken advantage if people since day 1. And because you had a bunch of moronic idiots listing to one dude like sheep they all are wether they meant to or not saved a company that should have rightfully collapsed. Now while all those fucking idiots who cared about making a quick buck off of someone else bone thrown to them because they were to stupid to invest on thier own in The first place saving a company wether they cared to or not allowing them to survive thrive and still do the customers wrong from here on out. It was a shit show and those invested into gamestop to revive it and keep it going cam go fuck them self. Gamestop does not deserved to be saved and they put them selves in that position of being shorted them selves.

Demand>supply"
2021-05-18 21:35:56,wallstreetbets,Actually not american but I spent the pandemic studying economics. It's fun to open the books once in a while
2021-05-18 21:38:30,wallstreetbets,You did provide very strong argument points tho. Don't get me wrong I am just mentioning that you seem to be discounting the money velocity. The points you have made are very much valid.
2021-05-18 21:30:18,wallstreetbets,"slowing consumer spending is quite literally how inflation is slowed... Take used cars for example. According to CPI the average used car has gone up 20% in a month. if people stopped buying used cars, demand drops. The idea is if everyone is working, supply chains get fixed, people have less time to twiddle their thumbs and buy lumber and other items. Increase production, increase saving, decrease commodity prices, increase margin, decrease spending, decrease inflation..."
2021-05-19 02:47:36,wallstreetbets,"This article does a good job of explaining why it's in the best interest of the government to let rapid inflation happen. It literally makes the debt worth less and grows tax revenues.

2021-05-18 22:34:32,wallstreetbets,62k is the median household income (before 2020 happened) thats two salaries of 31k
2021-05-18 21:39:42,wallstreetbets,That sounds about right.
2021-05-18 21:50:33,wallstreetbets,"Money velocity is picking up —that is why inflation is picking up , but once we turn everyone loose later this year when the population in fully vaccinated —-it’s a perfect storm. Tons of liquidity , pent up demand like nothing we have ever  seen , and supply constraints , combine that with massive Govt debts , and a lack of confidence in the currency itself —its gonna be ugly"
2021-05-19 10:25:11,wallstreetbets,"It’s actually quite reasonable if you think about it, a few extra bucks for physical is nothing compared to what the price should be at (as well as what the price of silver will be in a few months, even a few years).

My point was a hell of a lot of people make 30k or less"
2021-05-19 14:37:05,wallstreetbets,"Actually They're chasing higher profit period. They don't give a fuck which textbook terms you want to throw around to try to sound smart. Taxes, wages, regulation, expected policy changes, etc. all go hand in hand when it comes to profit. 

Now let me EDUCATE you on how the real world works. In 2019 the corporate tax rate was 21% in the US and 30% in Mexico. The minimum wage was $7.25 in the US and about half of that (on average) in Mexico. Mexico also has far less restrictive labor and environmental regulations than in the US. Now in 2019, Ford announced a plan to invest $900 million to expand operations in Ohio by 2023. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago when Ford announces that it will no longer be expanding operations in Ohio, but will now be spending over $1 billion to build a new plant in Mexico. Just what exactly has changed? The labor costs haven't changed in either country. Could it be the expectation that the Biden Administration is going to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% at a minimum and possibly as high as 35% (which is what half the democratic party wants)?

Who gives a fuck if taxes are considered an ""input cost"" or not? Taxes are a cost PERIOD.

If you do not understand this, you do not understand simple math, general business, or basic economics. This is not a point of debate, it's 100% true and you're simply wrong.

Now I recommend you finish reading that neat little economics book you're quoting out of before trying to post anything else.

Now go take another nap Bernie."

2021-05-19 06:50:18,wallstreetbets,"right

china is a great example, as its growth rate relative to its place on the economic development ladder only accelerated as it embraced state capitalism (fascism) in the place of communism

as the private share of its economy increased, so did its relative growth

2021-05-18 22:45:13,wallstreetbets,Main this people in this sub are missing: TLT is for the 20 year bond. The fed can let these go up faster than the 0-5 year bonds/general interest rates. I am extremely bearish on TLT and have been for about a month.
2021-05-19 00:21:18,wallstreetbets,"This is a good post and great thinking.

I've been buying TLT PUTs for several months now to hedge.  They helped my portfolio extremely with the first big yield spike.  For the rest of the year they will print. I just keep buying 30 deltas two to three months out and rolling them forward when there is a few weeks or month left.

Good luck."
2021-05-19 05:34:47,wallstreetbets,"The Fed has come out and said they'll let inflation run a while.  They can use the ""transitory"" excuse for a long time since there will be supply chain issues for a long time.  And raising rates would do a lot more damage than inflation ever could."
2021-05-18 22:45:31,wallstreetbets,Makes sense if you think interest rates will rise soon. Shorting everything when that happens will print bigly.
2021-05-19 00:24:46,wallstreetbets,Literally retarded. That's his previous position. The drop already happened. Why would you open a short at the bottom?
2021-05-19 19:38:00,wallstreetbets,"Why not TMV? I think this position makes lots of sense. If inflation is more than transitory, yields will sky rocket"
2021-05-18 22:45:43,wallstreetbets,TLT is just the 20 year bond though
2021-05-18 22:42:49,wallstreetbets,What? I was up 50% on my TLT puts I got a couple weeks ago. Unfortunately sold them too early apparently. QQQ puts and TLT puts more importantly are my core plays for the next two months or so.
2021-05-19 00:31:55,wallstreetbets,"TLT is already down a shitload, the market already priced it in"
2021-05-19 00:33:07,wallstreetbets,He may have already closed it to realize the gains
2021-05-18 22:58:01,wallstreetbets,>20 year is t-bond. And fed can buy as much or as little as they want
2021-05-18 23:00:36,wallstreetbets,"Are you thinking about getting back into TLT puts? What strikes are you looking at, if you don’t mind saying? I’ve been thinking about QQQ puts as well myself"
2021-05-19 00:33:57,wallstreetbets,I would if I was him. All depends when he opened the position. If he was lucky enough to time that top then he is well into profits.
2021-05-18 23:02:02,wallstreetbets,3 big macs made with my secret sauce
2021-05-19 06:29:20,wallstreetbets,"I don't have direct TLT puts any more but I may get some if it spikes up. I was waiting for a quick spike up to occur which is why I sold the original ones. Currently I have spreads betting TLT will be below 136 a month, few months from now. QQQ I'm currently out of--again waiting for a spike up. Important to keep in mind that \~10% of QQQ is Apple, \~10% Microsoft, and \~10% Amazon so really you're buying puts on those companies which you have to be more careful with than TLT IMO."

2021-05-19 03:55:24,wallstreetbets,"What are you expecting UWMC to do? Nasdaq down because inflation worries affect discount rate. UWMC doesn't move because nobody is looking at it. 20% inst own. The company is just originating and repackaging mortgages, I don't understand how people think this is some undervalued growth company. I have no positions in UWMC, there's no losing either direction, it's just a company I looked at the financials for and swiped left."

2021-05-18 20:04:50,wallstreetbets,Car companies have traditionally been poor long term investments. With Tesla you have the tech side of the business the other auto companies farm out to other companies.
2021-05-18 22:51:01,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.  The other big car companies are become MAJOR competition in a big way in the EV field.  Tesla is still an amazing company, but to be betting on the growth in Market Cap they had the past couple years?  That’s a brave position."
2021-05-19 11:33:39,wallstreetbets,"All the other car companies cant grow. They can switch their millions of ICE sales to millions of BEV sales, but still about same. Whilst tesla can go from few (comparably) sales to huge part of total vehicle market.

2021-05-18 20:32:06,wallstreetbets,"I sell top dollar lending software to mortgage companies all over the USA. I understand you need to justify your job as a secretary at a mortgage brokerage. As rates rise the basis points taken per loan increase. Each loan has a higher profit, these companies then sell the same loan to a GSE or an investor. That investor sells to the wholesale market for a greater aggregate markup and bundles packages of mortgage loans. UWMC is literally a leading company and backed by the mortgage brokers association. Funny how “you work in the industry” both GSE’s face class action law suits. It means next to nothing, you are basically justifying a negative outlook on a stock on class actions that exist just to make a lawyer money. With that same logic go ahead and short anything a pharmaceutical company is sued for, you are betting against the most connected and highest bill rate lawyers on the planet. Good luck  being a “bum”"

2021-05-19 19:03:45,wallstreetbets,">What a close. Actually really interesting price action today. We were able to defend all those levels. Not only that, but we fully backtested the pattern to the tick. Breakout is fully intact still - so long as we are above this teal line. Just sitting in limbo waiting for volume to come in. Technicals often precede news so we could see a catalyst soon.

&#x200B;

you TA boys are the exact same as astrology girls. You just keep predicting the same thing over and over til it's eventually right.

You were wrong, so instead of just saying ""I was wrong"" you draw up some new crayons that ret-con the previous crayons. TA is so worthless."

2021-05-19 14:31:50,wallstreetbets,More focused on the pattern itself honestly - the teal trendline sitting around 163.00 - that 167.57 is just the closest major level. We just back tested the pattern fully and everything is still intact for now :)

2021-05-18 22:44:06,wallstreetbets,You will notice no matter what TA you use - if you are doing it correctly it will line up with what the others are saying.
2021-05-19 01:32:49,wallstreetbets,"Sure, I can agree with most of that.  Trading GME will get you burned 9 out of 10 times and at least for GameStop, best case is to hold as they turn it around."
2021-05-19 15:11:50,wallstreetbets,"Of course. TA is a roadmap, not a crystal ball like most people think. Im just saying “the probability of more upside is the greatest above x level” so we can make better R/R trades."
2021-05-19 14:46:39,wallstreetbets,"Usually after a breakout there will be a retest. We are at the retest now, and it is moving down to the broken trendline to see if it holds. If it holds we should see upwards movement coming days."

2021-05-19 04:17:18,wallstreetbets,Interactive tv show is far from gaming and bare in mind that gaming industry is one of the hardest to be in. Try making gamers happy. There are legacy companies that are failing and you think that some netflix can do it. I think you need to do some research on game development and history of game development. Then you will see that netflix does not stand a chance. Even with billions of dollars (because money is not important)
2021-05-18 22:56:54,wallstreetbets,"Netflix would need to provide some level of comparable service, e-commerce and online retail would take over the market before netflix does. I have no doubt netflix is looking to expand, but unless they plan on reinvesting their entire focus, no way do they have the fundamentals to fill that gap. There are endless numbers of companies that would eat up that market before netflix does. They simply do not have the infrastructure to expand that quickly into a market that they have no prior or obvious interest in. If netflix truly thinks that they can replace these markets, they're morons. 

In short, the media/gaming market overlaps a ton and act more as layers contributing to the total interest of the market. This type of thing has been theorized ever since netflix/steam type services have come into existence. Guess what. The market for physical retail and theatres have proved the test of time and the new horizons for these markets look better than ever. But to think that bankrupting Amc or Gamestop would convert into more Netflix Subs is braindead. Even with expansion of Netflix, I don't believe they have any plans to capitalize on Gamestop or Amc's market because they can't do what Amc or Gamestop Does. Let's think logically. If you go to the theatre OR go shop Gamestop, you more than likely have a Hulu, HbO max, or netflix subscription. The overlap would be insane. If anything Netflix would be competing for market share within their OWN streaming industry. Makes no sense IMO.

Interesting theory, but a link to interactive netflix specials doesn't prove anytthinf like what you're saying. Remind me more of the stupid interactive FMV games that NEVER took off."

2021-05-19 04:49:24,wallstreetbets,"You sir are right... 

But the reason I put that source down on the table is because it establishes the link between Netflix and gaming. It shows they they are thinking about it. Will their company establish a choke hold on the gamining industry from their attempt of these interactive videos? No, I do not. But that's not to say that they don't have a prospectus in the industry. Netflix still has mail out DVD's. Do I think they can implement that system to encroach on Gamefly's teritory if it seemed within sight? Absolutely. 

&#x200B;

It's a long crayon line to connect dots, but I do think that Netflix is actively thinking about the GME territory when they saw them failing during the pandemic."
2021-05-18 20:21:03,wallstreetbets,"Cancelled disk service only a couple years ago after the bullshit already mentioned.

2021-05-19 04:59:02,wallstreetbets,"What makes you think GME was even a player in the industry ? XD the only reason theyre relevant is the short squeze, not their business. 
Why would you think netflix is about to replace gme in an already failing business?

2021-05-19 10:11:43,wallstreetbets,"He's been doing this since early 2020 and losing every time.

I wonder how much he's gonna make in the end, if anything, we'll know in due time.

Truth is it's not just TSLA going down though, **a lot** of tech companies are crashing **hard**. Apple which is usually a very stable company is down to 123 from a 143~ record after record earnings."
2021-05-19 10:15:17,wallstreetbets,"Most comments are supporting him, and some of the ones that are not are not really hating on him.

A lot of people were right about many bubbles, what matters is if you were right at the right time.

If you bet with Burry over the whole of 2020 you would've probably gone bankrupt. He's been very vocal about shorting TSLA for almost the whole previous year, and it only went up and up, meaning his puts/shorts resulted in pretty significant losses. He was wrong because of timing, and now he seems to be right because of timing.

I have no real opinion of the guy, but everyone here is just looking at one side of the story, it was obvious GME was gonna crash, but if you wanted to make money you had to know **when** it would crash.

It's also about press, when a figure like Burry goes around on Twitter flaming a company's value and talking about how he's shorting it massively you get some papers pick it up and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you were right big once and became a legend to the point they made a movie about it then you can quite literally make a company go down in value just because you say it will."

2021-05-19 10:02:39,wallstreetbets,"He also has been betting against TSLA for half of 2020 and lost every single time.

At this point I'm not sure how much he's made or lost on it."
2021-05-18 22:20:06,wallstreetbets,"Indeed. There are good reasons to think that the Fed will start to edge out of being super accommodative later this year in prep for hikes in 2022.

That's going to suck a lot of the air out of these *super* high fliers. The problem with Tesla is it would be richly valued at 1/2 or even 1/4th it's current price. It doesn't have to have some epic years long fall that erases decades of value creation. it only has to shake loose the momentum of a little bit less than a year and it would be under 200.

I dunno Burry's plan but if it were me I'd have leaps into 2022 sometime and sell when it gets to 200. Risky as all fuck but a pretty big payoff if it does pan out that way. I happen to think there could be a recovery after the turmoil of the Fed removing supports (because the economy will be screaming). So, I'd be trying to catch a hot money low."
2021-05-18 23:38:01,wallstreetbets,534mil is the share value of the puts he bought. His actual short position is a tiny fraction of that.
2021-05-19 10:05:39,wallstreetbets,"He didn't bet that much, he bought puts.

Truth is he's been making that bet forever and losing every single time, he is now winning, but one's got to wonder how much did he lose in his previous attempts."

2021-05-18 22:30:56,wallstreetbets,"On Tuesday, Burry confirmed on Twitter that he is also putting his money where his mouth is.

“So, @elonmusk, yes, I'm short $TSLA, but some free advice for a good guy....Seriously, issue 25-50% of your shares at the current ridiculous price. That's not dilution. You'd be cementing permanence and untold optionality. If there are buyers, sell that #TeslaSouffle,” Burry tweeted Tuesday night. December 1,Tuesday is when he tweeted and high price that day was 582ish..That tweet was deleted which burry has been doing it lately...My point is even Burry didn’t initiate short at top price it was at same levels as today he probably would have added more at 800ish levels to bring his average down and that would have ballooned his put holdings but you also need to account for 5-6 months theta decay.. He is definitely in profits no doubt about it since they are deep ITM puts but I am saying it’s not his best trade..Maybe 10% or 20% is a great trade for that big position and thanks for downvoting"
2021-05-19 04:50:26,wallstreetbets,So he was already short TSLA in December and added puts sometime after January

2021-05-19 00:50:52,wallstreetbets,"Baidu Stock Price Forecast

Sixteen analysts who offered stock ratings for Baidu in the last three months forecast the average price in 12 months of $351.36 with a high forecast of $407.00 and a low forecast of $280.00.

The average price target represents an 82.34% increase from the last price of $192.70. Of those 16 analysts, 14 rated “Buy”, two rated “Hold” while none rated “Sell”, according to Tipranks.

Morgan Stanley gave the base target price to $300 with a high of $390 under a bull scenario and $160 under the worst-case scenario. The firm gave an “Equal-weight” rating on the Chinese Internet giant’s stock.

“Baidu has provided better disclosure and has struck a constructive tone on its AI initiatives. We find it well-positioned in certain industrial applications. We also like its rich cash position and strategic investments,” noted Gary Yu, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“Our price target reflects materialization of AI investments, but we highlight milder near-term growth vs. peers amid risks from the competition. The company is well-positioned to ride the next Internet wave, but patience is needed. Our price target implies 18x consensus 2022e non-GAAP P/E vs. the historical 11-24x trading band since 2019.”

Several other analysts have also updated their stock outlook. CFRA cut the target price by $58 to $190. Loop Capital raised the price objective to $290 from $210. Baidu had its target price boosted by equities research analysts at Goldman Sachs to $385 from $383. Citigroup upped their target price on shares of Baidu to $324 from $292."

2021-05-19 07:36:43,wallstreetbets,"in order to be bullish on NIO. You must be bullish on China. And seeing   
how the U.S only now focuses on infrastructure investments that China   
did years ago shows me the U.S is lagging. NIO needs to succeed. The   
battery swap infrastructure and technology. Along with NIO global   
branding will succeed, but it doesn't need to in order for NIO to become  
 profitable in less than 2 years.EV and new energy  
 are methods of generating wealth that the EU and China have shifted   
towards years ago. Only now the U.S has finally decided to put a large   
investment into this market. The problem is that China is leading in   
patents for new technology than the U.S by multiple folds. The   
infrastructure bill you see now with the Democrats is good imo. You   
don't have to agree with how the money to supplement it is arranged or   
with it at all. But it's here, and it will happen.China  
 already started this decades ago and the blueprints have been shown in   
Xi Jinpings 2025,2035, goals. So china has the head start that the U.S   
does not. Thus allowing China to capitalize on these untapped markets   
unlike the U.S. China will not make the same   
mistakes other rivaling superpower powers during there time because   
China learned. China has already done what the U.S is planning to do now  
 decades ago. This is why instead of defaulting to gasoline, they opted   
in for EV and new energy infrastructures that scale along with new   
markets. So I am very bullish on China. If this does not succeed, then   
China fails. So far, it seems as if China is winning."

2021-05-19 01:45:37,wallstreetbets,"The spread of the Covid-19, and its variants is far from over. Don't let mainstream media fool you. All across Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Europe, there have been an increase in cases. This is what DARPA has been preparing for years with the goal of delivering powerful new defenses against public health and national security threats. This is where Sorrento and ANP technologies comes into play. On February 24, 2021, Sorrento Therapeutics announced the acquisition of ANP technologies. ANP previously served as the Research and Development laboratory for the Joint Service Agent Water Monitor program. During this period. ANP has developed highly sensitive assays for the point detection of biological warfare agents and environmental contaminants in water borne samples. Because of the NIDS proprietary technologies, ANP handheld assays are typically 5-100x more sensitive than other assays of the same format due o the nanomanipulation technology which orients the binding proteins or antibodies optimally, thus dramatically increasing sensitivity and more importantly- completely eliminating the Hook Effect, a deadly false negative result when testing highly concentrated samples. These technologies allow for the rapid assembly and testing of assays against new targets, particularly emerging threats with prototype assays typically being available wthin a short period of time after receipt of anitbodies against the target of interest. Under the proposed effort, ANP will develop rapid, heat stable handheld lateral flow immunoassays utilizing thermally stable recombinant proteins provided by the govenment with ANP's  Nano-Intelligent Detection System(NIDS) platform technology to quickly detect various biological targets, particularly those emerging biothreats for which no highly stable, rapid (15 minute) point-detection platform is available. As the head of DARPA said on a 60 minutes segment last month, ""They don't just give money, and wait for you to some day comeback to them with something, but keep a very close watch."" DARPA is also working with Sorrento on developing Covi-AMG and Covi-Drops, vacci-body therapeutics. These can act as a treatment, booster, and vaccine. The DARPA contract supports the accelerated development of a Gene monoclonal antibody(GMAB) neutralizing antibody that can be delivered by a simple intramuscular injection, enabling the recipient to produce the protective antibody, potentially within 12 hours to a few days upon administration. This would be ideal for the military, and in an outpatient setting for Covid patients. #BullishAF"

As professionals that tend to give patients quite a lot of drugs, including drugs of abuse like opiates, most docs don't think all drugs are bad and would have no problems with marijuana derivatives, but big issues with encouraging any form of smoking."

And this post? 2 upvotes 4 awards? https://www.reddit.com/user/UfoArUfoResearchTeam/comments/m30iee/hello_reddit/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


Its a picture of an alien saying ""Hello Reddit"" with extremely recent HD ufo sightings. Is this page also run by aliens?

I left a comment about a youtube video series documenting alien life https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTraveler3649/comments/n6jv4i/let_me_clarify_a_few_things/gyladts?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

Why does the second video in the series explicitly focus on an aquatic looking humanoid life form? https://youtu.be/ThDYazipjSI
Why is it so well rendered and sponsored by a software company ""building the next generation of the internet""? This protocol is based off of FileCoin, which, get this, uses the, ""Interplanetary File System."" This seems to be easing-into-it material. A science lesson for the ant farm. I bet they are all over the internet.
