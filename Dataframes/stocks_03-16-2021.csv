03/16/2021,stocks,"If the contract expires worthless or ‘OTM’, the price fluctuations during its life span are inconsequential and you will receive the full premium of 9 dollars. 

You have the option to ‘buy to close’ or ‘roll’ the contract to lock in guaranteed profit or avoid assignment to buy more time for the trade to be successful. Rolling is simply buying to close the contract (usually at a loss) and selling a new contract with a new expiration date and/or strike price. 

The fluctuations in the price of the contract that you are seeing are due to the change in the underlying’s share value in relation to certain metrics known as delta, gamma, theta, vega, etc. 

If you want to learn the specifics of how contracts are valued, look up articles/videos on ‘the Greeks.’ Although it is not completely necessary to understand every factor of options trading to successfully trade options. 

I also recommend r/thetagang if you are interested in learning options trading strategies.

I hope this helped. Best of luck and god bless!"
03/16/2021,stocks,"The numbers Mason, what do they mean?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Buying the contract is how you close your position. There are various reasons you may want to do that. When/if you do your gain/loss is the difference between sold price and bought price minus commission.. Although you already received the 9.00 you are not done with the position until you buy to close, it is exercised, or it expires unexercised (worthless). Therefore it is beneficial to have them display those prices and statistics for you."
03/16/2021,stocks,It you want to buy it back you pay the current price so you’d profit the difference between what you sold for and what you bought to close for
03/16/2021,stocks,Much appreciated

03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m invested in $ARKQ and $LOUP. Both are ETF’s focused on autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, AI, space exploration, VR, and similar technologies. I’d rather invest in these ETF’s than individual stocks because it feels like a safer investment than buying 100 shares of TSLA or some SPCE."
03/16/2021,stocks,Even good companies have dips. When that happens pounce.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Any of the oil/gas companies are on the rise from covid rebound and increasing fuel costs, and as they switch over to renewables they stand the best chance of massive gains. 

Ethics have little to do with making money off of other peoples work, so limiting your focus to that will severely limit your potential gains."
03/16/2021,stocks,"JNJ - Johnson & Johnson

About to get there covid vaccine approved by some authorities. It’s a cash cow, kinda old but it’s safe.

RBLX - Roblox

I used to play this when I was younger, I’m gonna invest in it purely for fun. Has good fundamentals.

DIS - Disney

Good post covid stock for when all their parks can full open up to the public. Also Disney Plus is a good Netflix rival.

BIDU - Baidu Inc

It’s basically Chinese google, I’m gonna invest when I’ve got some free time to look at the fundamentals. It’s promising though."

Is a good renewable stock, based in Germany.

Or the IShares Global Clean Energy ETF"
03/16/2021,stocks,What I suggest when you hit with big gains like that... take out your initial investment and let the rest ride. Say you had Tesla and you missed out on 10x because you were happy with 1.5x . There’s no perfect science.
03/16/2021,stocks,Consider using a trailing stop loss. Google it if you don’t know what it is.
03/16/2021,stocks,if something goes up a 100% in a day I sell it for sure

03/16/2021,stocks,"You're young, if you want to make for sure  money by the time you're 30 then you should focus on a market index. But since you're youngs it's also a safe time to take risk. If that's the case look for innovative growth stocks in the tech/green energy sectors."
03/16/2021,stocks,"For now, put it into a respectable ETF. While your money sits there making a small return, you can educate yourself on the numerous ways the market can (and can't) make you money."
03/16/2021,stocks,"First of all, it is great to see that you are thinking about investing in the market at a young age. This will work out quite well for you in your years to come. 

Put some of it into some ETFs. These are funds that track a particular market and you get a small percentage in a number of stocks in this market. I'd recommend you look at the S&P 500 ETF, which tracks the top 500 companies in the US stock market. Another good one is the FTSE All World ETF. This tracks the whole stock market across most countries. Have a look at some others as well."
03/16/2021,stocks,"For every 1 person that catches a 🚀🌑 5 others end up broke and selling their orifices at the truck stop. 

If I had an 18 year old little brother in your shoes I'd probably tell him to either pay for education, start a business or use it for a down payment on a condo/ small house (since paying rent doesn't build wealth). 

If you're dead set on high risk investing could go ARKK or MOON for etfs or look through Arks holdings to pick a handful of individual companies you're thinking will be major players 10+ years out. 

Tastytrade is probably the best free education resource for options."
03/16/2021,stocks,I would put the money into some trusted fairly decent risk ETF and paper trade for a year or two in the high very risk stuff until you get a feel for it. Contribute to your investment account with every paycheck. Then once you've gained a ton and lost a ton of fake money put your real money in.

03/16/2021,stocks,My brain - your brain - ETF's
03/16/2021,stocks,"If you’re looking for shorter term plays than an etf or mf then there’s a few around.   Blindly trusting someone else’s system is never a great idea, but I use both the motley fool rule breaker and Guerilla Trades for lead generation.   

The success rate has been best on Guerilla but I only bite on about 1/3 of their picks, and they tend to be fairly time sensitive.  It’s premised on anticipating a breakout movement on stock, so if you miss it you miss it.   The system seems to be built around technical analysis and triggered with volume movements, but it’s proprietary and doesn’t really say how it works or what the biggest drivers are.   I tend to pass on the stocks I think would be a crappy long term hold if the breakout went south, but the success rate looks pretty good for a quick 8-10% gains play.   Of the 14 I’ve reviewed it’s had 8 hit and 6 fizzle or just trade sideways.   With the market how it is today I don’t think that’s too bad of odds."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yep. They called mutual funds, bruh."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think what you probably want but don't know it yet is to either invest in a low-cost target date fund OR in something like a 3 fund portfolio consisting of 3 ETF's or their mutual fund equivalents.

There are studies done every year which shows that active managers, on average, underperform the market.   Some of course do better, some do worse, but if you look at an industry, on average, the market does better than a fund manager.   

In addition, although some individual investors can beat the market in the short term, it is very difficult to do so long term.

So, the solution is to not try to beat the market, but to meet it's returns.   So you go out and buy a set of funds which consist of all of the market.   VTI is a good example, which owns pretty much the entire US stock market.  VXUS is the same for international.   And if you are old enough that you want/need bonds, BND does the same for bonds.   

Or you can just get lazy and get VT which both VTI and VXUS in market capitalization weighting.    FYI, the sub r/Bogleheads describes this method and how to pick weightings, etc.

I'm sure someone will mention that you really want 'growth' funds such as VUG.   Or tech heavy funds like ""QQQ"", or some other interesting flavor of the dat.   The problem is that winners change.   With VTI, you always have some winners and some losers, but on average, they win at about 8% per year, or more in the last 10 or so years.   With something like VUG you will earn at a higher rate when ""growth stocks"" are doing well, and at a lower rate when they are not.    Note that VTI has outperformed VUG since approximately October of last year."

03/16/2021,stocks,"You can check stockdweebs on YT or Twitter. He uses TA. He doesn’t share much info other than TA. His premium has a dividends portfolio, growth, and swing trades. 

Ripster46 on Twitter posts his TA too and his premium services (btgpremium) is a mix of biotech and other stuff. 

Both of them have free and premium. It’s never a sure thing but they send you a lot of research (like phase 2 trial has been approved and they post it ahead of the news somehow or insider trading on this stock..)."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Fool’s stock advisor has worked fantastically for me, especially with how CRWD popped today"
03/16/2021,stocks,Jim cramer's action alerts plus is pretty good. Made really sweet returns using his recommendations.
03/16/2021,stocks,They're all random walks.
03/16/2021,stocks,Love the idea of Guerilla Trades.
03/16/2021,stocks,One other thought. How do you know how much to put in when they send the alert?
03/16/2021,stocks,Nah this is poor advice. Unless you like losing a bunch of your returns to grossly overvalued MER%ages
03/16/2021,stocks,"They publish the recommended stop loss and usually at least 2 price targets for selling.   So it’s up to you how much risk you want to take on, but I personally look at the gap down to the stop loss and decide how much I’m willing to lose on the trade, and buy that much.   Then if it takes off and gets to the first price target, attach a trail stop and let it run until that hits and closes the trade.   Adjust as needed for the specifics and my preferences on the specific trade."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I agree with your sentiment but .. not all mutual funds are expensive.    For example, the vanguard target date funds are only 0.15%, which is lower than many ETF's."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Well that 7% a year depends on your time frame. Over a long span of time yes. 

However in a given year don’t expect 7%. It’s typically more like 20%+ or -10%+ Overtime it averages out to be 7% a year."
03/16/2021,stocks,I've been told by experts that we should expect just 4% on average for the next 10 years from US equities since 2013 when the market went up ~30%
03/16/2021,stocks,"for what we know it can just keep going up and down and finish the year at a 6%. It's just an average after all. Some years were +45%, others -15%. I find interesting to look at the historical data to realize how unpredictable it really is : [https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns](https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns)"
03/16/2021,stocks,Nobody knows anything. We are all just along for the ride at this point. Fed speaks tomorrow. Which seems to make everyone uncomfortable for no real reason in particular. The problem is all the best case scenarios seem to be built into the market and no real good catalysts are on the horizon.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Amateur hour over my way, but I think we go back to 'average' gains. Looking out over the last five years, (throwing out the aberration of 2020, and assuming no major correction later this year) might yield a better picture. IOW, don't count your eggs before they hatch. Or better yet, hodl."
03/16/2021,stocks,Why is that? The constant inflation fear?
03/16/2021,stocks,That's an interesting chart. It also shows why I have a problem with those that claim 2020 was a bear market...
03/16/2021,stocks,Because US stocks have been permaovervalued since 2013 compared to the rest of the world
03/16/2021,stocks,"You can argue that this is the most unique time in history since the Industrial Revolution.  Many people believe the world is going to dramatically change over the next 10-20 years than it did the last century combined.  I don’t know if that’s a good argument or not, but it seems like a fair argument."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm afraid this is really bad news for the plug holders. 

In plain English the restatement says:

We overestimated the benefits from leased assets recognised in the balance sheet.

We underestimated the cost to service clients... which naturally means had we recognised it properly out profits would have been lower.

We have overestimated the benefits from Cape expenditure so we have to depreciate it quicker. If we had done so our profits would have been lower.

Basically massively overinflated the income statement. Now they can file returns in time. This only ever goes one way.

Now their clients will be looking at them asking them if they will still be in business in 6 months. Then they give them worse working capital terms. Then its game over."
03/16/2021,stocks,Plug will hit $100 a share by EOY 2022 easy. If people want to hold for years Plug is a GREAT company that is on a hiring spree and ready to grow. This is a beautiful buying opportunity.
03/16/2021,stocks,It’s temporary. Traders have short memories. This company isn’t going anywhere
03/16/2021,stocks,Its univestabke for most investors for atheist a year now. They have to put our their restated dodgy accounts. Investors will want to see a new set of clean accounts. Meanwhile the accountants and analysts will be going over it with a fine tooth comb to keep everyone nervous.
03/16/2021,stocks,"TDA does it too. The only way I found to do it is to learn as I go on Excel and track it all my damn self, because every brokerage wants you to think “Yay! Now that I threw more money at my account, I’m winning again!”"
03/16/2021,stocks,I use Webull and unless I’m misunderstanding the question it doesn’t show deposits as % gains
03/16/2021,stocks,"Schwab and Fidelity don’t include deposits in Performance. I believe that the account needs to be open a full month before the performance tab is available. 

Schwab does include deposits and withdrawals  in daily change."
03/16/2021,stocks,Thanks. Leaning heavily towards Switching to TDA cause the UI/view is so much clearer. So with TD how come you still use excel to track? If it shows your cost basis/gains
03/16/2021,stocks,"On TDA's site you can go to My Account > Cost Basis and you can look at your performance without cash deposits.

In the TDA app, you have to go to Positions, scroll down to See Cost Basis"
03/16/2021,stocks,In webull it does for me. I have to go to performance for an accurate % of gains/loss
03/16/2021,stocks,"Fidelity’s is wonky. Sometimes it’s accurate and sometimes it isn’t. When you transfer assets or close an account, for me it messed up the account history/performance numbers."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’ll have to contact them to activate performance, even though my account is over 1 month old I don’t see it under trade source"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I like to track my performance as a % gain or loss over time and compare it to the markets. There's no function that does that without showing your deposits as an acceleration ahead of the market. 

Of course, none of this has been an issue since I haven't deposited or withdrawn in some time, so the splash page on the traditional TDA mobile app (not ToS) does this beautifully (that's a newer update that didn't do that when I first started around this time las year). 

But once I un-fuck my employment situation and start making regular deposits again, I'm going to need to resume my own detailed tracking again."
03/16/2021,stocks,"That shows a snapshot of where I stand right now. But in order to track my performance over time and compare it against the markets, I have to record those numbers daily and track/graph them in Excel, because any chart TDA shows me with my balance history, it just gives the raw balance total, it doesn't give adj gain (loss) as a % over time. Doing this in Excel really isn't that hard - a couple minutes to set up, and a minute or so a day of inputting my own numbers and the closing prices for the 3 major indexes. 

(It actually takes longer than that, but only because I prefer to track my progress/performance on a more granular level than that, but in relation to what OP is asking about, it's a pretty painless process in Excel and it's not offered anywhere else I've found.)"
03/16/2021,stocks,"The TDA app on the main dashboard, where you have that graph where you can compare yourself to the major indexes, that's a really awesome feature but it's only functional if you don't make any deposits or withdrawals, and that's the specific feature I have in mind that OP is talking about."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If you are using the app, check the website. I’m not sure that it’s available on the app."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Generally FIFO but you might want to check w your platform to be sure. 

You will owe long term cap gains on what you sell.  If your confident enough to hold the old stock though, why not hold the new stock? Unless you just feel over invested in one company. 

Mathematically if you don’t think the stock will go up enough to make the newest stocks earn their keep, then you might want to sell it all. If you think your initial investment will keep going up, then the newest purchases will too. 

If you just don’t like seeing a loss or higher average per share price, you will still see that because it will (should) sell your oldest stocks first."
03/16/2021,stocks,"from what i've read, most brokers use the first in/first out rule unless otherwise specified. i don't think many brokers let you specify particular shares to sell though"
03/16/2021,stocks,"You specify what order if you don't want to accept FIFO.  It makes sense to document it contemporaneosly, so your desires are clear years later. (Not likely, but what if IRS actually did an audit.. a note on your sale records, recorded by the broker, is inarguable.)

Be sure to ask about *wash sales*.  I'm not sure exactly how they're defined, but it's another tax issue."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If the 173,000 shares were traded at the market price, there is no change in price.  All the ""price"" is is a record of the price of the last transaction."
03/16/2021,stocks,Switching hands. All the sellers except one may have been bought out and then someone took advantage and just bought everything? Market acts differently in AH.
03/16/2021,stocks,Seems like an odd transaction. No one is even selling that many shares anywhere near that price
03/16/2021,stocks,There's no price change if both (or all) parties agree to the closing price.  OTC rules may even favor market price transactions.
03/16/2021,stocks,But that’s a very large transaction. It seems the two parties were aligned for this transaction. I’m trying to understand for what reason?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Sometimes a seller wants to stay anonymous. They'd contact a broker to find a buyer or series of buyers to meet the price.  At the close of business, it's easiest to seal the deal.

As for who, and why?  That's the wonder of an open market.  Sometimes you even find out. Sometimes it's big enough for the SEC to require it be disclosed."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Don't use margin if you have less than 10 years of experience. Even then, I would advise against it. Don't use margin is probably my number one advice to anyone new to the market.

I've used fidelity for a while. I started on Robin Hood and hated it, terrible tracking, constant downtime, no interest on cash. I hated it so much I moved to fidelity even though they weren't free (which they are now). That said, I don't short and I never play options. 

Take it with a grain of salt, just my two cents"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m not really sure what the question is, but a couple general comments:   Fidelity is a solid traditional broker, they’re a good pick.  I’d personally pick fidelity over robinhood for a brokerage, but use what works for you.

As far as using a brokerage account for banking and regular expenses... I would never do that, too much risk of fraud.   If someone skims my card and starts charging things up I prefer to limit the amount accessible to the fraudster.   You may get it back but it’s a much smaller hassle if it’s a few hundred vs potentially a larger account.   If you aspire to build your brokerage account into a high dollar value then you probably don’t want check writing or cards attached for security purposes.  I think it’s best to limit the attack vectors to an account as much as possible, and highly recommend against it.   If you want to attach check writing then you can always use that to access funds pretty quickly if needed, and keep the checks for special purposes.   I.E. don’t write checks at a thrift shop or shady pawn shop, maybe use it for trusted banking only if you need to.

My personal preference is to bank with a credit union, and set up 3 checking accounts there.   One for holding cash & receiving direct deposits for wages, one for daily expenses, and a third one as an air gap account for doing external transfers.   Link the air gapped account to wherever you might want to send ACH deposits to, to avoid exposing your primary cash account as much as possible.   Transfer funds internally at the credit union prior to initiating the withdraw from fidelity.

With so much fraud these days, I like to handle day to day expenses (gas, groceries, restaurants, etc) out of the low value account checking account, with no auto overdraft or transfers attached.   Fund it according to a budget +10% and sweep monthly to savings or brokerage.

This may sound complex, and maybe it is, but I’ve been burned a few times with fraud and do travel a lot so it’s a serious issue to deal with.   And at the end of the day the bulk of the un-invested cash sits in a protected interest bearing checking account, the air gap is only used for transfers, and the day to day usage is essentially done as you’d use an ordinary single account.   So you’re not managing much besides an occasional transfer, which can be automated according to a budget for both investment and recurring bills and daily expenses.

Once it’s set up and automated to your personal budget, it’s very little maintenance and you have substantial protection from fraud, with a minimal amount of hassle.   The most exposed in the low value account might be 2 weeks of expenses, which is much better than 10’s or 100’s of thousands in a brokerage account with margin attached."
03/16/2021,stocks,I dont know about day to day banking but I had the same idea about using the card but only in an emergency since you can borrow up to $1000 and pay no interest as long as you pay it back in a month.

03/16/2021,stocks,"I am not new to the market exactly but it has been 20 years since I have traded, so I feel kind of like I'm starting over again. I have experience with margin and I did manage to stay out of trouble other than one margin call, which I will make sure I do not repeat. I did not plan on using margin unless it is a financial emergency or the cash is in the process of reaching the account. Learned my lesson about buying a stock on margin a long time ago."

03/16/2021,stocks,Thank you!
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah I could see it working with a brokerage as well, but I tend to switch brokerages every few years for whatever reason.   If you’re stable on the brokerage then fidelity or Schwab would be great candidates for the 3-account setup with an attached brokerage and ira.   Probably more convenient that way, but sometimes knowing it will take two days to transfer funds in from cash will help stick to a plan and resist impulse investments for me.   🤷‍♂️"
03/16/2021,stocks,"The w will be there as long as you own the stock.  Even if the value is higher then the adjusted cost basis since it is unrealized.  Once you realize the gain and don't own the stock,  you won't see the W if you repurchase.  If you sell at a loss and do not repurchase within the 30 day period, then you can claim the deduction."

03/16/2021,stocks,Are the losses only allowed based on the sequence of the purchase regardless of the amount of the loss? for example wash sale loss January 1K then February 2K then March 1K. So the only one I could claim is the very last sale in March for 1K loss ?
03/16/2021,stocks,"regarding your post from the thread you shared you said "" You can claim it fully for the year during which you fully close the  position which triggered the wash sale provided you do not trigger  another wash sale for that same security ""

By fully claiming does that mean in my example - wash sale loss January -1K (less than 30 days bought & sold) then February -2K (less than 30 days bought & sold again) then March -1K (more than 30 days before sold and not bought again through eoy). Would that be a claim of -4K loss or -1K loss ? I assume only 1K loss, is my interpretation correct?"
03/16/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/16/2021,stocks,"I have fidelity and on the 2020 statement it tells me the gains (49K), the loss (48K), then the amount that is disallowed (25K) due to wash sale. So i am paying taxes on like 25K total gains according to the summary because a lot of it was disallowed. Should i just go by the figure they gave me? There's almost 200 pages to sift through if i were to try to itemize it myself to arrive at my own number. Do you have experience with auditing it yourself? I will not do my own audit if it is more likely they did it correctly.

If I am able to use the net loss then do you have any guesses or know how I accrued 25k worth disallowed wash sale losses? There was a lot of swing trading in 2020 for me. Bought and resold many times in less than 30 days."

03/16/2021,stocks,"I think the stock has plenty more to drop. Maybe even down to the twenties. It was less than $5 a year ago, so there's overvaluation and now bad news"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I own PLUG, and I’m bullish on the company. I’m not so sure on your $100 price target by next year. Hydrogen will take off, and companies who play a big part will do well from it.. however it is going to be a slow transition. Investment into green hydrogen though is beginning to pick up pace. Should be interesting. 

In addition to PLUG; I like Ballard Power & ITM Power"

03/16/2021,stocks,"Isn’t microstrategy a 700 stock now? But interesting discussion. I’ll have to read up on the dot com more. 

Though I still stand that the drop is more so fear that this a scam like Nikola, which it’s not.

A correction kind has already happened already from its ATH  of 70+"
03/16/2021,stocks,Well I surely do not like this. I hope you’re wrong
03/16/2021,stocks,They had share dilution so  2-3x is more realistic. I’m still bullish

03/16/2021,stocks,"I've been looking at it recently, because Widerøe (small, but significant airline in Norway), has been cooperating with RR to make electric planes that are going to be airborne by 2030. But I can't buy the stock through my broker (Nordnet).

03/16/2021,stocks,Honestly I’m expecting 8x return in 5 years.
03/16/2021,stocks,Im 2000$ into 3LRR (3x levereaged rr) and hope for it to print!
03/16/2021,stocks,If by 8 you meant the infinity symbol ♾
03/16/2021,stocks,Lol nah but being realistic I see it hitting $13-$18 in 5 years. That’s anywhere from 7-10.5X return. Def happy to sit on it for a bit to see it hit that.
03/16/2021,stocks,Following
03/16/2021,stocks,Thanks hopefully some knowledge peeps will give me some better insight
03/16/2021,stocks,In this market ccl could go bankrupt and be higher after hours
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm bearish on Carnival as well but damn dude. What are your short/put positions that you're this aggressive in the comments against valid criticism. 

You must be getting completely blown out of your position."
03/16/2021,stocks,OPs wife met her latest boyfriend on a carnival cruise.
03/16/2021,stocks,Damn. Hard faceplant.
03/16/2021,stocks,If I'm not mistaken they also have a $1 billion dollar shelf offering just sitting their like a ticking time bomb to explode in stock holders faces
03/16/2021,stocks,"It’s trading at 1/3 of its operational market cap all of this is priced in. No one thinks it’s going to be a quick turn around but fact of the matter is CCL isn’t going under, 25-30 seems to be the floor."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Royal is the same, I had a cruise booked with them awhile back for this may and it was canceled."
03/16/2021,stocks,Time to buy the dip then
03/16/2021,stocks,"I hate the idea of cruising. That said, middle America seems to love piling into a large tin can full of gluttons. So I’m torn. On a personal note I wouldn’t mind if there were no such thing as cruises (at least the way they look right now). But from an investing perspective, perhaps this is worth being on the watch list.  Not to invest in yet. But eventually they will likely come roaring back"
03/16/2021,stocks,Can someone explain to me why they were dipping so hard from 2017-2020? What caused them to plummet? That’s the only thing really holding me back
03/16/2021,stocks,"my favorite covid headline will always be ""American Airlines Stock Just Soared 41% for No Good Reason"""

03/16/2021,stocks,my wife was introduced by a bull stud by me.  we take turns and video tape it.
03/16/2021,stocks,they have already done a couple offerings.
03/16/2021,stocks,"If they aren’t going under, their stock sure is. Downward trend for 3 straight years prior to covid"
03/16/2021,stocks,god you people are so delusional.
03/16/2021,stocks,they aren't coming back this year. spring is already canceled.  half the summer is gone. they will cancel the rest of summer also.  fauci is biden's chief medical advisor and he is on record saying we shouldn't lift restrictions. that is his opinion on the general population. his position on cruises is even worse i'm sure.
03/16/2021,stocks,Have you ever been on a cruise? I’m gonna guess no because those things are a hell of a time and experience
03/16/2021,stocks,if you believe they are going to come roaring back now would be the time to invest.
03/16/2021,stocks,Perhaps people are more likely to jump on a plane with better links these days. I hate the idea of a cruise personally.
03/16/2021,stocks,"yes, but on Feb 22 they filed for an additional billion in shelf offerings that they are likely to drop at any given moment.  NCLH just dropped one a couple weeks ago and with the recent cancelations across the industry I see another wave of dilutions coming for CCL also. I agree with your point just adding additional bearish sentiment for the near term"
03/16/2021,stocks,It’s definitely priced in at this point
03/16/2021,stocks,"People are ""delusional"" because they thought that COVID would still have a negative impact on travel & tourism the first half of 2021? Huh?   

CCL has built up a lot of debt, but they also have a bunch of cash, and they've mothballed their fleet in such a way to reduce their churn until this blows over. Plus we're also seeing a very sharp rebound elsewhere in travel & tourism that is very bullish for particularly 2022, so as long as they can weather this storm into next year they'll likely survive it."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Facts are that’s how this works. Their assets are right about equal to market cap. It typically takes 7 years for spy to double. In 7 years do I think CCL will double from its current value? Absolutely likely if not more.

Glad to see how defensive you are and unable to discuss bodes well for you."
03/16/2021,stocks,"He also said we shouldn’t wear masks and that he says what he thinks Americans are ready to hear, so take everything he says with a grain of salt."
03/16/2021,stocks,Once.  Never again
03/16/2021,stocks,"Again. I hate cruising. And I do like the Peter Lynch school of investing. But I swap out “what I know” for what I like.  And more specifically, staying away from things I don’t like. I’d be ok with missing the absolute bottom of a stock for a little more certainty. So I will just watch for now"
03/16/2021,stocks,Cant imagine that’s the case. Cruises are very popular. RC didn’t have this problem. Seems to be solely carnival. Cruises are one of the cheapest vacation options that exist. You can find some cruises to the Bahamas out of NY for the price of a round trip plane ticket during some parts of the year.
03/16/2021,stocks,ok. what are the odds they drop it soon?  have you done any financial research?
03/16/2021,stocks,"> so as long as they can weather this storm into next year they'll likely survive it

if you are so confident why this line?"
03/16/2021,stocks,lol 7 years.
03/16/2021,stocks,he flip flops on a lot. but since he flipped on masks he has been pretty steady in his refusal to lift restrictions.  he doesn't even want to lift restrictions on the general population.  i'm sure his opinion on cruises is to play it even safer. cruises are know for spreading viral infections.
03/16/2021,stocks,Sea sick? Bad experience? Mind telling me what ship it was? I can understand for people who get sea sick easily it can be miserable if the ship is smaller. If you wanna invest in any cruise line royal carribean is the one. They have the absolute greatest cruising experiences
03/16/2021,stocks,"I haven't looked too far into it to know what their books look like or if they need a capitol raise.  I'm not invested in either, but cancellations, recent competitor share dilution, and a shelf offering that high is enough to make me stay away for now.  I do have some travel plays in my portfolio, but I think cruise lines are will be a little farther down the line before I would jump in"
03/16/2021,stocks,Because of the stuff I said earlier in that same paragraph? That they built up a lot of long term debt and had mothballed their fleet...
03/16/2021,stocks,You seem to be rather dumb I’m going to have to end this conversation here.
03/16/2021,stocks,It was a carnival 3 day out of San Diego. Part of it was probably the route was lame. But really it’s just a personal thing. I’d rather go some place alone with my family rather than with a group. Two exceptions I can think of. Alaska inside passage and maybe some river cruises in Europe.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Disney is hands down the best, even for people with no kids. Their staterooms all have 2 bathrooms. Service is absolutely perfect every time. They put all of the children in kid jail all day long and you rarely ever see them. Also have late dinner times so there are no kids. RC and Celebrity are really good but they are no Disney."
03/16/2021,stocks,you people are all over the place. one minute you're saying they will survive the next you are saying they might not.
03/16/2021,stocks,Oh yeah iv heard carnival is much more of a party cruise and they focus mostly on that. I also think their ships are smaller compared others. Iv only been on cruises to Bahamas and parts of brumuda. Maybe why I enjoyed them more with the warm weather the whole time.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Iv been on a Disney and 2 royal carribean. Not enough for adults to do on Disney ships. Way too kid oriented if u don’t have kids and you’re a young adult. Seems like you have kids so obviously your experience will be different, have you ever been on a Disney ship as an adult without kids? I couldn’t even imagine. Only reason we went on one was cause I had a very young brother and sister at the time"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Almost like a 10,000 feet view of *any* company has both bear and bull signals."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah that's valid. I'm more of a ""I'm on vacation and don't want to lift a finger for anything"" kind of vacationer. We aren't partiers. We just stay in the adults only areas and get treated like royalty for a week with no outside communication."
03/16/2021,stocks,the signals are bearish dude. bearish.
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm bearish on your opinions being well grounded. When you look at *any* company one dimensionally you're just flipping a coin with extra bluster.
03/16/2021,stocks,"one dimensionally? they keep canceling cruises with no end in site, they will be forced to sail at limited capacity once they do start and they are having to give tons of credits to travelers just to try and attract them.  the ceo has even gone on record stating things will be in trouble for years."
03/16/2021,stocks,"> one dimensionally?    

Someone referenced CCL's balance sheet and your response was name-calling them ""delusional.""   

> they keep canceling cruises with no end in site  

You may want to switch on the news, the US just hit 100M doses of COVID-19 vaccine, they've already started setting targets for travel reopenings. Pretty sure the end is not only in sight, but we can reasonably speculate on the exact month."
03/16/2021,stocks,fauci is biden's chief medical advisor and he is on record saying we shouldn't lift restrictions. that is his opinion for the general population. his position on cruises is even worse i'm sure.  again. you people are delusional.
03/16/2021,stocks,"> fauci is biden's chief medical advisor and he is on record saying we shouldn't lift restrictions.   

As we've told you repeatedly the first half of 2021 is priced in. What he Dr. Fauci last week was:   

> If you look at the planned rollout of the vaccines, we would hopefully get to [Herd immunity] by the end of the summer and the early fall,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said.  

Which is very good news for CCL. Could be running cruising again before 2022 which may exceed current market expectations."
03/16/2021,stocks,"he said if the vaccine rollout goes well we could, could see herd immunity.  well the vaccine rollout is stalling in america and it just got a kick to the head in europe.  

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/16/chaos-in-germany-and-italy-after-suspension-of-oxford-vaccine

i can provide stuff to back up my bearish thesis. seems most bulls can only provide ifs and maybes."
03/16/2021,stocks,"How much of their earnings/revenue will be affected by this? Will the American rollout being faster than expected outweigh these losses? (Personally I think so) The stock will likely consolidate in the 25-30 range, with high IV. Seems like an excellent stock to sell covered calls and cash secured puts on (10% of stock price as premium on .70 delta otm monthly puts/calls is crazy lucrative). It’s also likely that earnings and revenue will be higher than 2019 levels in 2022 with inflation and pent-up demand headwinds. Western countries will also likely all have herd immunity by the end of 2022, if not earlier, leading to them operating at near or at full capacity next year.

America is a good example of how fast things can turn around, sentiment regarding covid was so negative only two months ago, now it is projected for the US to be fully reopened by July.

Also, jpow will likely keep interest rates low by continuing to print money, which will cause multiple expansion and asset inflation for all stocks, so you would be fighting the overall momentum of the market and especially the value sector right now.

TL;DR CCL doesn’t seem like a good short or long right now in the short-term as it consolidates with contracts that have expensive premiums, but will likely have another jump in the next 6 months with global reopenings and earnings/revenue guidance increases along with positive news regarding covid."

03/16/2021,stocks,"For QQQ options expiring January 2022, 1k will buy you a put with strike price of 250. That means it would need to go down 25% just for you to break even on your put. So it isn't that great of protection.

The problem is that you're trying to protect an investment of 10k, but one contract on QQQ is like protecting 100 shares (an investment of 32k). This can make you profit in the event of a significant crash, but it also means that you're paying more than you need just to protect your own investment.

I think a better option would be buying NUSI. This is a tech ETF with downside protection at the cost of a limited upside (they sell calls and write puts). You can see how it performed last march for example, the downside protection worked and it went down a lot less than the general market."

03/16/2021,stocks," 

So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I started buying at $141, then again at $136, then again at $134, then again at $121, then again at $117. My cost basis is now $129.70. I personally think AAPL will be back in the $140’s before too much longer. Seems like a safe stock to hold long term. Look at the 1-year and 5-year charts for it."
03/16/2021,stocks,Depends on your amount of capital and individual risk tolerance. Different for everyone. Apple will continue to increase year over year. Can never have too many shares.
03/16/2021,stocks,When you really believe in Apple then just Dollar cost average.. just invest something every month.. that way you don’t have to worry about market timing.. and if the price should drop you could always buy the dip
03/16/2021,stocks,AAPL is a great company to hold. I'd only stop in order to diversify portfolio a bit. I'll grab another share or two tomorrow with my stimulus check. Probably while on my 2014 MacBook which still runs great.
03/16/2021,stocks,If it dips keep buying. AAPL will go up no matter what. Keep averaging down.
03/16/2021,stocks,It is always a good tie to buy more Apple. Apple is where I move my other gains.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I would buy whenever the market evaluation is lower than you would give it. In this market, damn near everything is expensive. 

I've owned aapl for a few years. It still looks reasonably priced compared to it's competitors. That said, it doesn't seem like a screaming buy, which is how it seemed in 2019 and 2018 

I'm still bullish, buy, hold and only check back once a year"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Please read books with valuation metrics. So many young, naive investors are going to get burned in the long run. It's honestly hard to watch."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If you are investing long term then it is safe to buy Apple at any level as long are you are consistently dollar cost averaging on very strict time intervals ($200 a month, or $100 every two weeks, etc.), just keep an extra 10-20% of your total portfolio off to the side in CASH. Then when you get a big downturn you have the capital to buy those dips. Just remember to never sell.

Short term investing or even perhaps momentum investing those are entirely different strategies. That is where doing your research comes into play and what value you think Apple stock should be compared to where it current is. And in that case you would probably want to do Options. That way you can look at different news and try to forecast what you think is coming and then try to hedge your bets with different strategies, because IMO Options are pure gambling.

You can also try to use the volatility as a gauge. It is like the calm before the storm. Low volatility generally means the price is too high and others are thinking the same thing. You can probably grab better deals during periods of high volatility. There will always be some news that breaks that you didn’t uncover during your research."
03/16/2021,stocks,Marketcap is pretty high. Perhaps 160-180 range

03/16/2021,stocks,Would you care to share some wisdom on why you think this?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Everyone loves a bull market. Unless you're doing dollar cost averaging in broad based index funds (for which there is still systematic risk), there will always be risk in stock picking.

Stocks go down occasionally, and when they do, sometimes they don't come back up. I'm old enough to remember the dot com bubble, and many many of those stock literally just went bankrupt. They went bankrupt because they didn't have any earnings. The same thing exists for many of the hype stocks of today.

I'm not saying that AAPL is a bad investment, i'm just saying the weight of many of these questions are completely disassociated from actual metrics, and it's being fueled by a once in a lifetime event. I just hope people start talking about substance.

Not financial advice."
03/16/2021,stocks,Thanks for responding. Agree with what you say too. Old enough to remember dotcom bubble and the fall out afterwards too. There certainly is a similar feel to that with some of the tech companies in the current market
03/16/2021,stocks,"Again, i'm not saying there will be a crash, i'm just lamenting talking about *actual companies* that exist in the *actual real world* and how to value them here, by looking at price movements on an exchange, rather than by looking at cash flow and balance sheets, is a terrible way of assessing value.

I've got a few long odds firms. E.g. I hold BYND, and I'm planning on holding it for minimum 10 years, because I expect the industry to replace much of the existing food industry at a better price point, say, for example Conagra or Tyson. Thus, I'm using *existing companies* to do comparative analysis, and I'm still getting *optimistic* long term PE ratios around 5. (again, not financial advice)

If people were putting out analysis like this i wouldn't complain, but all the talk here is taking about stock movements in some sort of artistic feel, rather than being based on numbers."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Wow, this is phenomenal growth. I am long CRWD and NET, I hope this puts to rest that these stocks won't grow in an inflationary environment."
03/16/2021,stocks,Cream of the crop. Probably one of 5 stocks that can justify its price to sales multiple.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Thankful for some great earnings and growth, especially when I decided to get into CRWD at all time highs before the tech sell off. This is a long term hold for me but that initial plummet of 20% was scary."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I also bought near its ATH, cybersecurity is a secular trend and CRWD has the widest moat. Longterm we'll be alright."
03/16/2021,stocks,Undervalued compared to the general market but so much drama around it. Maybe buy a small position and add if it dips or the uncertainty works itself out.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Gonna see what happens tomorrow, if it dips more ima grab some, I feel like this is the typical buy when others are fearful situation"
03/16/2021,stocks,I’m personally adding as much as I can at this price range. I accept the risks
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm adding if it drops below $215
03/16/2021,stocks,"For a company as massive as BABA, there’s way too much downside and headwinds for me. When I invest in that market cap range, I’m looking for much more safety than it has to offer."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’ve got a fair chunk of my portfolio in BABA currently. I first bought at 225 early in the year, then again at 260, and just bought again yesterday at 228. It’s certainly a big risk right now with all of the regulations surrounding it, but I am confident it will eventually pass. If ANT group ever IPOs that could be a catalyst for a huge spike in value as well."
03/16/2021,stocks,He supposed to be the Amazon of China
03/16/2021,stocks,"Some people are afraid to invest in a company whose business plans and leaders can be ""disappeared"" by the government. Go figure."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm bullish on Baba, especially at the current price. If I had cash I'd keep adding."
03/16/2021,stocks,"The Chinese government isn't done with their antitrust and regulatory push, so I would wait."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I was holding longterm, but the browser drama made me give up and sell today.

The stock is undervalued for a reason. Too many issues with China and the CCP."
03/16/2021,stocks,Didn’t their platform just get removed from all Chinese phones and AppStore’s? Yea good luck... Jack Ma is persona non grata. I’ll give it two years before he’s dead and we’re talking about another Chinese golden boy who actually plays it nice with Xinnie the Pooh.
03/16/2021,stocks,Chinese companies should come with massive upside because you're buying (effectively unaudited) secondary financial statements with no consequence to the company if they're fraudulent
03/16/2021,stocks,"It is not worth the stress to me. I don't want to always have to worry about what is going on in China or what the Chinese government is going to do.

There are more than enough great American companies to invest in that will make me good money, so I see no need to add this China stress to my life. It's just not worth it."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It can’t get much lower, 90% of stuff on Amazon comes from Alibaba.  If anything, Jeff Bezos will throw some of his money, to pump it up.  I think it’s reaching its bottom, if not already.  The whole Trump, Biden transition might have messed them up with all them trade deals and such.  They are bound for rebound soon."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Will probably be fine in the long run, but too much drama and personally I think there are better places to put my money. It's not even above pre-pandemic highs anymore and I would be pissed if I held through the drop and V recovery just to be back at this level."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I bought in early February for a longterm hold and sold today after I heard china removed the app. It will continue to be on my watchlist but I honestly dont expect it to move much at all in the next couple of months until they get their shit figured out, in which I will probably buy again, I will pass on 5% gains to watch it bleed another 25%."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I bought at 265 USD and am down quite a bit, but I believe it will get back to 300 within 1 year"
03/16/2021,stocks,Did they not just ban them from Chinese app stores?
03/16/2021,stocks,That's me too.
03/16/2021,stocks,Same. Sold BA calls recently and bought calls on AAPL and BABA.
03/16/2021,stocks,"baba isn't a startup that need jack ma, they'll be fine"
03/16/2021,stocks,Their web browser got pulled from app stores. If Amazon made a browser that got yanked from the app store would it be doom and gloom for them?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Why would Bezos give two fucks? Amazons interactions with alibaba is through FBA, which Amazon is moving away from with their own products. Amazon doesn't need FBA to come through Alibaba. Am I missing something?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"If Amazon was in a communist dictatorship and Jeff Bezos insulted the regime, yes most likely."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If alibaba suffers, Amazon will also suffer.  It will be years before Amazon starts making their own products.  Amazon makes a nice percentage from FBA, if the supplies diminish, so will their profits."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't think that's correct. Alibaba going away doesn't make the manufacturers disappear. If there is any lapse whatsoever in products on Amazon, myself and 30 other people I know would fill the void instantly. If you can identify a product in mass demand on Amazon that doesn't exist, you'll have a $20M business in under a year. China isn't a magical land locked behind alibaba. You literally just fly there and talk to any of the thosands of manufactures who are all dying for USD sellers. Test it, put Amazon FBA on your LinkedIn and prepare to be bambared nonstop with Chinese sales people. They aren't Alibaba reps"

03/16/2021,stocks,Either way the market won't care
03/16/2021,stocks,There’s legislation right now to stop insider trading in congress. Pelosi is keeping it from getting to the floor. Anything that reflects poorly on their ability to be in the market won’t pass. Outside of that who knows?
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think the corporate rates going up wont impact much aside from corporations not buying back as much stock with the tax savings. 

The only hike I think would matter (as someone in a HCOL area) is the estate tax exemption. 3mil is a bit low where it’d hit the upper middle class harder than the wealthy."
03/16/2021,stocks,"US had an amazing run in 1950s-1970s with much higher corporate and top-bracket rates until Reagan decided to ruin middle class with his trickle-down BS. And even he raised taxes when he needed to. 

There are some things I lose sleep over, but it isn’t additional few % points that Jeff Bezos will pay in taxes."
03/16/2021,stocks," - It won't pass congress (lack of votes).    
 - If it is *somehow* it would look nothing like this.    
 - Even then the impact would be relatively minor for the markets/may be measurable over tens of years rather than YTD."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You start by asking for a Bugatti. 

Eventually you get a banana."
03/16/2021,stocks,"This would increase corporate taxes by 33%, decrease earnings, lower stock prices, and make the business environment less favorable compared to other developed countries.

Raising taxes in a recessionary environment is not wise."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I doubt they would actually be able to raise taxes that much. Obviously, it would be negative for equities, both public and private. 

I wouldn't expect it to pass with the same figures you presented. They will need to make tons of concessions to get the votes."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If corp tax rate goes from 21% to 28%, that means post tax earnings on each dollar go down from 79 to 72 cents, which is less than a 10% cut to post tax earnings. So, I'm not worried about it. Also, some stocks are for unprofitable companies so they would be impacted even less."
03/16/2021,stocks,I bet it will go up but probably somewhere in the middle. A compromise ti move the legislation along.
03/16/2021,stocks,"certainly not just rolling back taxes to pre-trump tax cut, gives our country a little better chance even though it should be 3x higher than that."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Please feel free to expand on the side effects I might not be considering, because I'm sure there are nuances I should consider, but if we are to accept capitalism as an benefit to the society that promotes innovation, and not just a new form of oligarchy, estate tax seems like a no brainer."
03/16/2021,stocks,"There's 2 reconciliations for 2021. It's very possible they try, but it's likely to take months.

Edit: My second sentence is factoring in possible doubt from Manchin going the reconciliation route again. It's not just that either with this, there will be fighting over the clean energy things they'll try to put in the bill (if it were to happen, it will be infrastructure paired with a tax raise). 

I actually could imagine these games being the catalyst that finally causes the S&P to lose 8% and the Dow closer to 8% as well."
03/16/2021,stocks,That train sailed long ago when we were busy pulling all the recessionary levers we could find during an economic boom.

03/16/2021,stocks,no I do not. I'm not those 5 minute day traders.
03/16/2021,stocks,Thank you for this
03/16/2021,stocks,Appreciate the work you put in!
03/16/2021,stocks,$2 seems like an absurdly low price target for AMC. I would have thought $5-$8? Below $3 I'd probably be stocking up.
03/16/2021,stocks,PLUG has some news come out about their financials in after hours. Any opinions on this?
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm liking that UAL news. Most of my screwing around money is on them right now. They seem like one of US airlines with the most room left to rebound to pre-covid levels and all the news on airlines right now is looking good. I'm already up like 30% on them in a month or so of trading.
03/16/2021,stocks,Thanks for this! Is the new Facebook feature allowing users to build websites outside of FB? A little confusing. Or just an additional / new “FB Page” format?
03/16/2021,stocks,My pleasure!
03/16/2021,stocks,My pleasure! Glad you find the recaps useful
03/16/2021,stocks,">Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet

Funny - the same analyst one year ago (march 18, 2020) downgraded AMC from $12 to $1 - makes you wonder

03/16/2021,stocks,Agreed seems very low to me. Just passing on the information from the analyst
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m not 100% sure on this so don’t take my word for it but I own a small business and my website was built through Google but lives outside of Google 

So I pay Google for the domain and what not but my website doesn’t look like a Google homepage if that makes sense"

03/16/2021,stocks,"Don’t think in terms of ratio. Know your monthly expenses (include every single thing.  Housing, food, insurance, phone, utils, etc.).  You should have 3 months of expenses set aside in a “high” yield online savings account as an emergency fund."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I keep at least a year of bills in cash, but I’m crazy. Sure it’s sitting there doing nothing, but if tshtf, I have a year to make sure my kids are sheltered and fed with no problem."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Typically, I keep 15% in cash.  During the drop last spring, I went all in and was fully invested.   Now, I’m liquidating some assets acquired last spring as they are now long term gains and subject to a much lower tax rate.  I plan on having a slightly higher cash position (~25%) going into the Fall of 2021.

Depending on where the new tax proposal is heading, I may be more heavily weighted in bonds or cash later this year.  To decrease my tax load, it may be best to take gains this year (2021) before tax increases hit.  I expect many people to do the same, which will probably cause a drop in the market."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Ditto on creating a separate emergency fund account in high-yield savings or checking before doing anything else. Personally, I think it’s good to build up to 6 months of living expenses in it, minimum. A general rule of thumb is only invest in the stock market money you definitely won’t need for the next 5 years. This way, you won’t get shaken out at the bottom of a downturn."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You should have everything except what you need for food and bills in some kind of asset, cash is constantly losing value, I only have what I need for daily spending and monthly bills in cash, all of my savings are in investments"
03/16/2021,stocks,About tree fiddy
03/16/2021,stocks,"I do something similar; I don’t have a years worth of bills but I do keep a years worth of mortgage payments. People say it’s a waste of money but my mortgage is always going to be the same regardless of inflation, and I sleep better at night knowing no matter how sideways things could get, I have a roof over my head for the next year."
03/16/2021,stocks,I disagree. Many folks that did this a year ago were forced to sell their investments at extreme lows when they had almost no cash and lost their income.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Exactly my reasoning. Better safe than sorry when it comes to your home, likely your largest investment."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I guess it depends on what kind of situation you’re in, I should have rephrased this and said “this what I do” rather than “this is what you SHOULD do”"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Emotional = Getting Married to a Stock

Getting Married to Anything = Losing Your Money"
03/16/2021,stocks,You just can’t. The stock doesn’t care about you so why should you have any feelings towards it.
03/16/2021,stocks,You bought Tilray “really high” 😁
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yep. First shares I ever bought, AMD

I will never sell it no matter what. It's a tiny position so it literally can't impact my portfolio even if they went bankrupt. Reminds me of where I started"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Own a stock, don't date it. You have to be able to let go of your darlings. I bit the bullet myself in the last month and sold out of my beloved Baba and Tencent positions, because I could no longer deny the severity of the headwinds facing those two companies from the CCP. Had I remained emotionally attached to those companies, I'd be suffering right now as the stocks continued their decline. Instead, I rotated that money into stocks that are doing much, much better. Don't become emotionally attached."
03/16/2021,stocks,No
03/16/2021,stocks,"Getting emotional about any type of investment is how you lose money. It's fine to be irritated with a stock not going your way, but if it goes anyway more than that is going to kill you mentally"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes, for 5 years I had this idea that I would never sell WEED cause it was my first. After seeing it hit 70 twice and crash back down I sold it the third time, just before it crashed back down again.

Don't marry stocks."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes, which is bad for your trading/investing."
03/16/2021,stocks,For me its MPW. One of the first stock I bought years ago. I liked their name so I kept buying it at $13 a share
03/16/2021,stocks,"I've started profiting off of APHA's trampoline lol. Made more selling and rebuying of this crazy yoyo than I planned on making off of the investment in the beginning. But yeah don't get emotionally invested in stocks. If it makes me money? great. If it loses me money, meh. If it yoyo's fairly reliably then profit off of it. I do it with about 50% of my shares just incase it keeps skyrocketing one of these times. I'll buy at 17 sell at 20-22. This last time I actually got a good sized buy in at 14 so that was fun got to average down and sell some of my older 17$ shares."
03/16/2021,stocks,LOL!  AGREED.  I could learn something from my wife's boyfriend.
03/16/2021,stocks,Are there prenups for stocks?
03/16/2021,stocks,Very wise advice and an important life lesson I’ve learned to help me focus my priorities.
03/16/2021,stocks,My wife is a stock?
03/16/2021,stocks,Just caught that ha
03/16/2021,stocks,"You sold at the right. Tencent just lost $60 billion in value from their payment system. For breaking some law in china.
And alibabas search engine was removed from the Chinese app store. For almost the same reason as tencent"
03/16/2021,stocks,No
03/16/2021,stocks,They're called options.
03/16/2021,stocks,Yes. Called stop loss 🤣🤣
03/16/2021,stocks,"I got very luck with my timing, but like I said, it's why you can't get too emotionally attached to a stock. Better to sell a questionable stock when there's still a lot of profit to take rather then ride it all the way down."
03/16/2021,stocks,that’s how I keep my stocks from getting complacent. gotta let them know you got options
03/16/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/16/2021,stocks,"So for example if I were to buy AAPL at $125, panic sell at $122 then buy back in like baboon at $125 and then sell before EOY at $140 I could claim the $3 so long as the entire position is liquidated before EOY?"
03/16/2021,stocks,Maybe I sold it this year.  I can't remember. I only bought 2 shares and now it shows -$62.
03/16/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/16/2021,stocks,Always had trouble understanding wash sales and the tax behind claiming harvest loss. Basically you can claim it so long as the entire position is liquidated before EOY but NOT if you still have the position?
03/16/2021,stocks,We’ll see what happens. Just hoping that Powell can keep his promises on everything he has said and their announcments line up with Powell’s earlier statements. I just hope he’s straight forward.
03/16/2021,stocks,"So dont buy at open, see if afternoon does anything weird?"
03/16/2021,stocks,Think he’ll trigger another sell off tbh
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think he will affirm rising yields indicate a strong economic recovery and the Fed won't intervene.  He will reaffirm his new long term inflation outlook knowing everyone is going to be pissing their pants when seeing high headline number due to the base effect in the next 3 months.  

The only important thing we are getting from this is the supplemental leverage ratio clarity.  For comparison the in Canada the OSFI unwound the exemptions for banks today. 

The banks are trying to hold us hostage by saying they will be required to dump hundreds of billion in bonds.  Hopefully Powell under Joe has a bigger spine than Powell under Trump."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I bought puts before closing, TSLA, NIO, AMC. Let’s see what happen."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Does the Fed want to see the market crash and JPow want to sit through diatribes from congress people who don't know what FOMC stands for?  

...steady as she goes with near zero interest rates and inflation that is within 2% (how inflation is calculated is a moot point since we know what answer we want)"
03/16/2021,stocks,I don't understand why people are worried about inflation. Traditional quantitative theory has long been obsolete.
03/16/2021,stocks,"He speaks on Thu, correct?

I think he will chose his words wisely to mostly  reiterate what he has been saying all year long with holding rates. But my guess is that he may drop a few hints at potentially raising rates a bit sooner than expected due to recent favourable unemployment rates and to curb potentially spike in inflation due to the expected reopening of the economy."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Buy puts and short and make easy money it always happens, market so predictiable with this one,  I put 30k on spy puts for tmrw"
03/16/2021,stocks,interesting also...
03/16/2021,stocks,"Powell says inflation still isn’t a problem and everyone claps and continues to feel their retirement is safe. Once again I will say that what happened last March was the last lucky recovery we have. People should have taken that as a sign to change their investing strategy and hedge assets that ARENT ALL US $ BASED... a potential reality is that the massive generation of near retirees in the US are potentially going to lose their whole livelihood.

Both of my parents(not knowing much) are convinced they are hedged but fail to realize all of those hedges rely on a stable dollar."
03/16/2021,stocks,"He will cave to banks and extend SLR and let inflation run hot, since we dont have any right now (bwahaha), and what we do have is a strong economic recovery as you say.

Bonds will continue to sell-off, the market will get spooked for 30 sec, and then SPY will push through 400, lol."
03/16/2021,stocks,What's your stance on the leverage ratio?  You think he signals a reinstatement or does he offer an extension?  I'm really kind of holding a chunk of cash until there's a bit more clarity around this (hopefully we get it tomorrow)
03/16/2021,stocks,Tomorrow at 10am est I'm pretty sure
03/16/2021,stocks,Well this isn't the worst idea... but holding it past tomorrow could be.
03/16/2021,stocks,This
03/16/2021,stocks,Wednesday is correct.
03/16/2021,stocks,"The FOMC press conference is from 1:30pm EST to 2pm EST. So by 2pm EST you will know the results of his talk and market reacting accordingly.

This link is helpful: https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar"
03/16/2021,stocks,"They demonstrated an Audi EV recently, I think Feb 9th. See if you can spot that day on the chart."
03/16/2021,stocks,"they were gaining pretty well then, more so after the 9th, but today straight up all day.  I only see a high earnings estimate for q42020"
03/16/2021,stocks,The short interest is going up because people believe the company is going down. GTT is still billions in debt even after securing a billion dollar deal. If your plan is to go balls deep in hope that the institutions and hedgefunds are wrong and this is the next GME. you're gonna have a bad time
03/16/2021,stocks,bought at 1.90 selling at 2.90 or whatever i can get by the end of the month
03/16/2021,stocks,Could you source your short interest % numbers?
03/16/2021,stocks,"You’ve missed the past 3 discussions. We are aware. 

Short interest is mostly held by institutions. The data is there... 

We aren’t buying and hoping it’s going to be a next GME, we are seeing very similar things happen. It’s purely speculation. 

Actually based on my recent polls youre the only one to have said I believe it’s still going down. That or they haven’t spoken up. 

Based on the past discussions I don’t think that’s our plan. But thanks!"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I own 747 shares @ 2.00 and six $2.5 calls @1.09(started as spreads, bought the dip(~1.6)). I’m betting on a recovery after the sale, not a gme type squeeze. Around 30-40% of my portfolio in this. Not selling At a loss. At $5 selling half or bust. The dump that happened recently at ~2.50 does make me more worried though. I hope I don’t have a bad time."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If I could attach an image I would... ortex is the real time short interest numbers. I know TD AMERITRADE offers that info but it’s delayed.

Pm an email and I got you"
03/16/2021,stocks,"You literally asked ""is this the next GME"""
03/16/2021,stocks,"And you didn’t give a direct answer. You said if you’re going balls deep youre gonna have a bad time. 

I did thank you for your input even tho i didn’t see data from you. 

The ownership on the short sides is not regular people. You can access all this data at ortex or a delayed version on TD Ameritrade. 

I suggest you really look into it and you might see some upside. If you see prices moving up you’d know why... and what to do. that’s all."
03/16/2021,stocks,And wrong I literally asked “could this be the next GME”. Slightly different implementation there. One is currently one is future.

03/16/2021,stocks,"If the crash actually happens soon, it's wise. However, most people are bad at predicting crashes.

Here's a post that became very popular for predicting an imminent crash:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ipp3e9/dont\_be\_fooled\_this\_is\_the\_market\_crash\_my\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ipp3e9/dont_be_fooled_this_is_the_market_crash_my_dd/)

You can see how it turned out. Is your prediction better than that guy's?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Right about direction, wrong about timing."
03/16/2021,stocks,"10k in Spxs 10 years ago is $30 today. Granted they did recently reverse split so may not be due one for a little while. Theta just eats these types of funds up since they're using long options for leverage. 

My opinion if you're sure you want to bet that this goes up I'd buy calls instead of stock. Could buy the 30 days out and roll at 15 days to 45 days out. Theta will eat your lunch a bit too but maybe less than owning equal amounts of underlying. 

Looking at past for reference in rona crash last March it topped around 38 (r/s after) so wouldn't go too crazy on strike"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Let’s assume that my thesis is right but my timing is unknown. I believe the crash is coming... eventually. 

I’m not really asking about the state of my DD, but about the reasons an ETF like SPXS isn’t a good investment for a retail customer.

Edit: after skimming the post, my thesis is that we continue to live in an inflated economy propped up by the US government, with negative externalities hidden by stopgaps and bandaids. I believe a collapse of the entire American economy is coming somewhere between 3 months and 3 years from now."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Ok... I’m really looking for information on what I don’t understand about the ETF. 

Are you saying my thesis is wrong?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I mean, the plan would be to sell at the spike, so 10k from date in past to today isn’t really my question. 

Buut I will say that I don’t get theta. I try, but I can’t quite grasp it."
03/16/2021,stocks,"By the time the crash happens and SPXS spikes, it may have already fallen so far that the current spike can't recover what was lost. Look at its graph. If you had bought it in August of 2017, you will probably never be able to sell it for a profit. We've had crashes since then, but none brought it back up to where it would have been when you bought in."
03/16/2021,stocks,what kind of prediction is that? 3 year time frame? Thats like saying a hurricane will likely  hit NA in the next 3 years. If a bear yells crash in the woods would any body hear it?
03/16/2021,stocks,You should be buying ammunition and canned food to put in your bunker if you think the entire economy is going to collapse.
03/16/2021,stocks,"unfortunately, being wrong and being early is the same thing in the market.

if you buy inverse etfs, your position will decrease as we rocket higher and by the time the market crashes, you might just end up breaking even"
03/16/2021,stocks,"The spike in theory is about $38. 

So basically options value decays over time. These funds are usually exclusively invested in options so their value tends to decrease everyday except when there's a large move in their favor."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Then why shouldn’t I daily DCA?

I guess I could run the math on past crashes and see if it’s just fucked because stonks always go up."
03/16/2021,stocks,">Then why shouldn’t I daily DCA?

That still won't work unless the crash happens soon, or is gigantic."

That said, if you do believe we will try to limit Chinese trade influence, I would look at similar countries. Vietnam and South/latin America etfs might be the way to go."

03/16/2021,stocks,"It would probably be quicker to get the cash out and have a big bonfire. WeWork thinks it’s a tech company when it’s just a letting company. Still had the same problem in that it has long term lease obligations and short term rent income.

I’m not convinced post lockdown everyone is going to rush back into WeWorks offices. Personally at the rate they’re burning cash I’m not even sure WeWork will be working in a couple of years."
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm out
03/16/2021,stocks,Don't do it.  More work from home even after the pandemic.  We work business model is done.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m skeptical of the fundamental business model. I’m a thirty something stereotypical millennial with a lot friends who are freelancers or work from home etc. I’ve met many people who’ve given it a shot, but I don’t know a single person who’s continued to use their service after a few days. It’s simply too much money for not many more resources than a library, coffee shop, or your house. 

If I wanted to invest in a coworking space, I’d buy a bar with WiFi."
03/16/2021,stocks,"co-working, flex spaces/satellite offices for employees will come back with the new flexible work schedules, but the issue with WeWork is their flexibility, that's not what you want in leasing/renting commercial space. that's always been the biggest risk to them and won't be forgotten when it comes time for investors to give their money to them."
03/16/2021,stocks,"WeWork has been unanimously considered a complete shitshow of company since the dawn of time, and reputations stick. A company as notorious as WeWork is doomed on the public markets, and it would take an insane effort to change institutional and public minds about the stock at this point. Avoid at all costs come IPO day"
03/16/2021,stocks,Maybe WeWork should switch to a B2C model.  Sell subscriptions to people who can work from home but their home situation is not conducive to work.  It would be like a gym membership.
03/16/2021,stocks,Do you work from home and for how long? After a couple years I went from “sure I can handle this” to “I gotta get out of here.” Been at it for 10 years. I’m betting people will realize how much it hurts later not now.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Right, that’s why it’s value is more sensitive to cultural shifts. If permanent WFH goes up, we’ll see overall demand for coworking spaces go up and that’s good for the short term at least. And if the shift doesn’t happen then it’s not worth it."
03/16/2021,stocks,"That's exactly what I was thinking before reading it they way you wrote it.   Now I'm thinking,  what you wrote is obviously correct,  therefore IF they do an IPO it will be priced at a significant value so maybe it should be bought for a short hold and sell a month before lockup expiration."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I work for a company with over 250k employees and many job titles can permanently work from home and this is a really old stodgy company, not a tech company.   So if my old company is doing it alot of younger and smaller companies will as well.   My company has been selling buildings left and right.

Btw, before COVID my company was moving in the opposite ; everyone work in the office mode and getting hardcore about it.    So if my company pivoted, more agile companies surely will"
03/16/2021,stocks,I doubt the cultural shift you guys are talking about is even real. Employees that want more flexibility will end up putting themselves out of a job imo as companies realise there are cheaper alternatives overseas. Not to mention the fact a lot of these employees will now be lacking “Face time”  I imagine they’ll be skipped over for some promotions for people that still show up to the office that will encourage people back to the office.
03/16/2021,stocks,"doesn't matter whether there's a cultural shift, it can easily be disrupted. there's a large risk of holding commercial property - whether WW owns it  or leases it - while subletting it to people/companies that can end their relationship any month. 

and there are A LOT of independent co-working spaces, at least in big cities, maybe many of them died with covid so WW will be the only option in many markets, but as someone who splits their time between the SF Bay Area and DC, both have more (and IMO, better) co-working options for less

edit: but i should disclose i was never sold on their business even when they were a ""tech"" darling, seemed easily disruptable and volatile back then. the big commercial real estate groups could just start doing flex leasing on their own instead of leasing to WW for them to mark up the space and sublett"
03/16/2021,stocks,"depends on where you are in your career. a mid-late career 30-50 something with a family or homeowner with a hefty commute is likely to jump on a 2/3 or 3/2 split, they have enough experience and social capital to navigate relationship building, promotions, etc while not being in the office every day. a person fresh outta school or grad school? yea, they'll likely want to be in the office more for socializing, face time, learning, promotions, etc

there's a big difference in those who argue WFH full time will remain vs flexbile work scheduled that consist of 2-3 days in office, for so many companies, that was unheard of prior to the pandemic, now they have zero reasons/validation to say no to that."
03/16/2021,stocks,Where to validate short data??
03/16/2021,stocks,many stock screeners show it at that such as yahoo finance or finviz
03/16/2021,stocks,"Some of his analysis is correct but he fails to actually support the bubble notion. Sure, prices are higher than they usually are, and sure there is more risk and volatility, but none of that is inherently bad. It’s simply different from prior environments. 

He is right that it will come crashing down if interest rates climb back up to pre-2006 levels. But that’s a big **if** that would require a level of sustained economic growth not seen in decades. That outcome should not be mistaken for a guaranteed one."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think the big missing piece of info when discussing bubbles is leverage. What really create bubbles and not just overvalued markets is leverage. So if I was looking for a bubble in overvalued places of the marlet, I would ask myself: where is the leverage? When you have identified both overvaluation and leverage, then you can start to think about what’s required for the bubble to collapse and trade accordingly"
03/16/2021,stocks,I did a [DD on Lockheed](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/lnnfhu/lockheed_martin_dd/) a couple of weeks ago. I think it's been significantly undervalued and I see >20-25% upside from here. Bought some at $325 and recommend everyone does the same!
03/16/2021,stocks,"Similarly I love **RTX (Raytheon)**.

Tensions are high all around the world, civil wars, fake wars. Government spending on defense should be high. RTX not only manufactures weapons and aerospace equipment, they also have a strong cybersecurity division that earns US intelligence contracts.

And on top of that, the candidate that will be joining Biden's cabinet as US defense secretary is a current member of RTX board of directors (will be stepping down to take on new role as defense secretary). There may be some biases and favoritism when it comes down to awarding defense contracts."
03/16/2021,stocks,"secure government contracts.part of the US military industrial complex in a world filled with uncertainty. not much DD needed here. sur you can delve deeper in their actual numbers and all. but I do not remember one company supplying the us military and NATO Partners  as well as basically any foreign country that ever bought weapons from the US with military equipment ever going bankrupt. 

I think LM is gonna be fine."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I just bought 25 and I am planning to buy more. My thesis is that once covid frenzy dies out, we will go back to the normal life of cruises, vacations and wars. I don't see many good buys in the first two, and LMT seems the best choice among LHX, NOC, GD, RTX. They have a nice growing pattern, dividends.

I would say PLTR belongs there too, and I bought some during red days but they are a speculative trade."
03/16/2021,stocks,LMT is my largest position
03/16/2021,stocks,I think it's a good company and undervalued. But I actually sold all mine recently to put into SP500
03/16/2021,stocks,"Fan of defense as a whole, historically solid and despite people only thinking about will there/wont there be a war or budget cuts, to me the reality is the industry is going nowhere, especially as the world and technology constantly advances.  I have ITA as an etf (which I know is heavy Boeing) but I like the rest of their defense holdings more than the other similar etfs. I compensate buy holding a chunk of LMT individually on the side to weigh that percentage of my portfolio more to my liking.  Been adding more LMT recently at these prices and P/E 14 or below. Plan to hold for life."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Good stock, has had a good run. I just think at this point IBM has more upside on a % basis."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I bought 2 a week ago and 2 more just 5 minutes ago. 
I like their Space envolvement and the Company Culture. 
Here’s a nice podcast by Lockheed about skunk works if you’re into engineering and super cool jets:

https://open.spotify.com/show/2KA4zLF7EmYo9EhZGgCYtB?si=COB-WirGR1-0UgM7jEH0BQ"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Looks good to me, I went in today. Morningstar put its FVE at $433."
03/16/2021,stocks,"they make money, good enough for me"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I have about 20% of my portfolio in LMT. I’ve been accumulating regularly for almost 5 years. I started to back off at $400 late last year, but didn’t stop buying altogether. 

I think it’s undervalued at the current price, but there are a few acquisitions in the works that should further help.

Edit: I think a significant portion of the dip in stock price since Fall 2020 had to do with changes in executive leadership, retiring CEO and VP or Aeronautics death. I haven’t done a deep dive on the fundamentals during that period, but on the surface it doesn’t seem like there’s been any decline."
03/16/2021,stocks,Question the Morales of that company
03/16/2021,stocks,2 shares in and hoping for more fake war in the middle east to pump those numbers up
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think it’s a decent buy, but US government spending will have to shrink in the future, so essentially they will have a shrinking total addressable market. Additionally US troop deployment abroad has been shrinking every decade aside from a small blip in the 2000s. There is opportunity in space but they are being out innovated by spacex. And it’s hard for me to wrap my head around exactly what the total addressable market will be in space anywhere in the near future."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah overall the more research I do on them the more legit they seems. AI technologies, quantum computing, partnerships with NASA and Blue Origins which is owned by Jeff Bezos to build spacecraft. Plus their hypersonic technology seems really legit."
03/16/2021,stocks,"+1 I gamble in pharma, pennies, and SPACS, but $LMT and $F are currently my two largest brokerage positions."
03/16/2021,stocks,Raytheon fundamentals aren’t as good
03/16/2021,stocks,I own some PLTR too. Love the stock!
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't think I could ever make LMT my largest position, it's too dependent on just one customer (over 80% of their revenue comes from the US government). But that said it's still 100% a terrific buy right now imo."
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah I can understand that as the military budget goes on. While I was looking into them what is making super bullish on them is their investments in Space technology. I think Space and Space companies are going to be huge in future decades from now.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I am curious on your thoughts on IBM. Why are bullish on IBM? Not saying that they are a bad investment by any means, just curious because I hear a lot of bearish stuff from people but I never did any research into them."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah thats were I am the most bullish on so far is their involvement in Space technology. Love how they are building Spacecraft for the US military, NASA, and Blue Origin."
03/16/2021,stocks,great mindset love it
03/16/2021,stocks,"On the other hand China is becoming more aggressive, and the leadership of the two parties are determined to maintain the U.S.'s stance as world policeman, reversing some of the vacuum Trump left.  Spending on drones, missiles, and planes will likely go up over the next twenty years, even if there a slump in the financial aftermath of Covid."
03/16/2021,stocks,"And we have the F-35 for a lot of countries at least for a few decades.

Although my best defense stocks ytd have been GD, LHX and RTX."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I cannot refute that Lockheed has stronger fundamentals the past couple of years. However, from my understanding, these big defense contracts are driven by the connections with the few guys sitting up top. Lockheed benefited most from the previous administration. Raytheon should benefit a bit more from this administration.

They both should be winners, but as I mentioned, the incoming defense secretary has strong ties to executives and board members who own a lot of shares of Raytheon."
03/16/2021,stocks,"And Raytheon is not the same type of company, even though it’s in the same sector. Its products rely heavily on the success of Lockheed and others because it supplies components."
03/16/2021,stocks,source?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Also look into their fusion research. It’s a long shot, but could be incredibly lucrative if it works."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Completely agree, the reason I like them the most is they’re not just defense they’re involved in a lot of innovation - such as space tech as you mentioned, hypersonic tech, cyber security, and who knows what else (like seriously who knows what other top secret stuff they got in the works) haha"
03/16/2021,stocks,The new leadership team. The Red Hat acquisition. New partnerships formed with PLTR and Moderna among others. Spinning off the legacy business at end of this year. Short term IBM will report Q1 2021 earnings on 04/19/2021. If revenue again drops so will the stock on that day if the past is an indication. Overall I expect revenue will increase in 2021 as will the stock. The question is when.
03/16/2021,stocks,Interesting! Thank you for the insight! I will definitely look more into them 👍
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes obviously, eventually gas stocks may take huge hits due to environmental policies imposed by countries now on fossil fuels
Metal stocks would rise electric vehicles stocks nowadays are just being hyped by anyone who doesn't understand the market usually no one will think about metal strategy just like no thought about tyre and rubber stocks"
03/16/2021,stocks,I started a Position in AA yesterday. they account for 20% of aluminum production. glad to see others thinking similarly.
03/16/2021,stocks,VALE for me. Great forecasts and they pay dividends while you wait.
03/16/2021,stocks,"TLOFF, but if my solar stock hemorrhaging ever stops will definitely be looking at Vale."
03/16/2021,stocks,"For the ""prevision"" of the next 3 months, i'd say its mostly bullshit. Seems to predict a large rise on almost all stocks.


As for the ""buy"" or ""sell"" i think its based 100% on technical analysis. So it mostly tells you if the stock has momemtum or not, but i wouldn't follow it blindly.


As an example, its telling me to strong buy GME and to strong sell my value play ASX."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It does seem like a lot of the stocks are buy / green on their site. If I see something is orange or red, I tend to steer clear. But I don't know how accurate they are historically. I'm a pretty new investor and I do like the web interface."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah, some are said to go like 100% or more.  Just my insight, but I think it's probably just a nice or fun thing to look at.  I haven't monitored a stock for 3 months or know how often they are right.  But it probably lowers as time goes on before 3 months are up.  However, I do like the stop loss and support lines for ideas."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I hate the stop loss, since i'm investing long term. I don't want to sell my value stocks because of a random dip.


I think its only usefull to help time a sell if you want out of a stock, or maybe time a buy."
03/16/2021,stocks,"That's true.  In all honestly, now that I think about it.  It might not be as useful as I first thought.  Since they determine this at the end of the day.  The next day could be totally different from where the stock starts out."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You can always sell the contracts if they were recently purchased, I did so when I mistakenly purchased some calls. Just sold them the next day for a 30$ loss, no biggie."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Not looking good for $2.50. Remember with Options, having a huge potential to grow doesn’t really matter if you’re buying one in the short term. They could be a huge success a year from now but all that matters to you is this Friday. The more important thing for short term is a catalyst for a quick up or down swing, and these short term catalysts are very hard to predict."
03/16/2021,stocks,If you’re new to trading you should avoid options. Just buy and sell and research options in the meantime. You could end up owing a boatload of money to your broker and it could destroy you for life. The most you can lose buying is what you put in. You can potentially lose infinite money trading options. Just be careful friend.
03/16/2021,stocks,"If there's a huge potential for the stock to grow in the future, why are you being weeklies?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Maybe a stupid question, but what does the 20c in the post mean? I'm assuming the c is for call, is the 20 the amount of calls purchased in that case? I know 2.50 is the strike price and 3/19 the expiration date.

I've been trying to look up this way of writing options and it's been driving me crazy not finding any answers :')"
03/16/2021,stocks,"No biggie?  That’s 3 whopper meals, you could have fed 3 people for one day."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I agree. I don't do short term stuff.  It's way harder to time.  Sudden spikes seem to come out of nowhere.  Sudden slides are just as likely.  Hat's off to people that can make money like that.  


I'll also say that it's probably better to make a bad call on your first trade.  If you made a load of cash, you'd be hooked and that would cost you in the long run.  It's like a gambling addiction.    


I was in Atlantic City years ago and a guy sat down beside me and put $20 in a slot machine.  A few minutes later he hit a jackpot and was like, ""That's the first time I've ever played one of these.  This is easy!""  I said, ""That's the worst thing that could have happened.""  He just stared at me blankly.  Clearly he didn't get was I was trying to say.  hahaha :D"
03/16/2021,stocks,I learning that. I came in to tading recently thinking good company earnings reports would be a good catalyst. But with more research im starting to see most stocks dont go up in fact go down after most earnings reports. Should i get out now or wait till it expires currently ill get back 40 of the 200 i put in.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Your losses are finite unless (1) you're using margin which nobody should ever even think about, or (2) you buy puts and the stock skyrockets at which point you owe more than you have. Doing long term ITM calls is pretty safe for a beginner IMO you're only slightly more leveraged than shares."
03/16/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/16/2021,stocks,Was super cheap and was expecting more from earnings with their surprise revenue. Im in long on them now.
03/16/2021,stocks,"20 contracts, calls, strike price 2.5, 3/19 exp date.

03/16/2021,stocks,lol I’ve lost way more than 30. don’t be a paper handed bitch
03/16/2021,stocks,Feed 3000 African child with 30 dollars
03/16/2021,stocks,Everything is relative
03/16/2021,stocks,I hear ya. From this view i have to agree. After i placed this last week I also did 2 other bit longer plays from the excitement of maybe making money. They seem pretty stagnant for now so at least I may have a chance.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I thought the same exact thing with my first couple short term trades, I now realize that in the short term, sometimes stocks make no sense lol, I still to long term investing now , God speed on future options though"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I still think that it’s a little too risky for someone who is new to trading. I’ve been investing for a few years now and I still don’t know enough to trade options (shows what I know haha). But still I think that you need to really know what you’re doing or it’s just gambling and you could end up losing a lot. Then again, I’ve always been a passive value investor more than an active trader so what do I know."
03/16/2021,stocks,I read one time that puts could lead to infinite losses on a headline. Was all I needed to see to never click the puts button. I shouldn't even be trading honestly i got lucky after learning DFV doubled down at 40. I bought a few as well.
03/16/2021,stocks,Just wish 200 went to buying not betting.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Thanks! Was mainly confused about the '20c', and I just couldn't find it searching through various places. Thanks again for the explanation!"
03/16/2021,stocks,I care about you grammar. “How cares”?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Dude, go smoke a blunt or something."
03/16/2021,stocks,With water and grain maybe.
03/16/2021,stocks,😂
03/16/2021,stocks,"As for staying in or backing out it’s all about how much you need that money, the closer you get to the exp date without price movement the more the price will drop, if you don’t need the money though it’s completely up to you"
03/16/2021,stocks,Thank you.
03/16/2021,stocks,"You're right though, anyone playing with options should definitely know what they're getting into first or people will pick the wrong ones and lose a ton of money (i know i did). The super risky short-expiration calls and puts look really sexy when newbies see someone on wsb make 500K off them but they're the easiest way to destroy your account. I definitely encourage everyone to look into LEAPS though, especially value investors because you're holding long term anyway, just getting more bang for your buck!"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah i've only done puts a couple times and you have to be super twitchy with a firm stop loss to prevent the trade going against you. And even with that, most of my put trades have been losses because you freak out and panic sell anytime your puts go even slightly red."
03/16/2021,stocks,"So I'm new to this and confused now. As far as I know, the maximum loss for buying a put is the premium, just like buying a call, it can expire worthless but the loss is limited to that as opposed to shorting a stock."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Unusual type of writing.    
    
    
20 ($premium) FENG $2.5C 3/19"
03/16/2021,stocks,cool
03/16/2021,stocks,you go smoke a blunt or something. freaking out over $30 lol
03/16/2021,stocks,buying a put or buying a call your max loss is the premium you paid for the option or options.....when you sell calls and/or puts your losses can be much more
03/16/2021,stocks,"People are confusing buying to open a put and selling to open, and covered vs naked options.

For instance, I bought to open a put contract on AAPL with a 110 strike, when it doesn't hit 110, it expires and I'm just out the premium.

I also sold to open a put position in FUBO with a 28.5 strike. When I did this, I was credited the premium of the contract, but I'm on the hook to buy 100 shares at 28.5 if the price goes below that. If it doesn't go below that, then I will simply keep the premium and move on. 

Keep in mind this still isn't infinite loss even in the worst case.

The real danger is selling to open a call option for which you are short the shares needed to cover the position. In that case, if the price goes to infinity, you will need to buy 100 shares at whatever price to fulfill the contract obligation, which is infinite loss."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It’s called sense of humor, you little troll."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You will learn fast with experience. If you want the easiest options plays just do calls/puts on SPY. 

One thing I've learned is that the price of an option doesn't matter that much and that you want to give yourself as much spread as possible in case things go poorly for a week or two. My first few options were all expiring in less than a month from the purchase date, and I learned that it's better to give yourself a few months, or even do LEAPS that expire in over a year.

Also google 'optionsprofitcalculator' and play around with what you think would go well."
03/16/2021,stocks,What exactly about an option do you have questions about? Go paper trade some options first.
03/16/2021,stocks,suncor
03/16/2021,stocks,"Look at indicators like RSI and MCAD and buy. Dont get too greedy or overconfident. Set a limit sell order once bought. May be 20% gain. 
Better to look for low value stocks like BB, F, PTR, (so contracts are similarly lower in value) and may be buy a contract or two while you learn. That way you wont lose much while learning."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You're better off not starting in the first place.  Options are very high risk and the only people who make money in them are very experienced traders who use complicated strategies with funny names (like iron condor, long straddle, and protective collar).  Simply buying puts and calls is a fool's game."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Buying options isn't all that high risk though, is it? As long as you understand you can lose the premium, and don't get caught up buying high cost GME type options, your losses should be pretty manageable/expected."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes your losses are limited but you can lose your investment much quicker than you can buying stocks if the stock moves strongly in the wrong direction.  The other thing about basic options (buying calls/puts) is that you can get the direction right but the timing wrong and still lose everything if the stock doesn't move where you want it to within the appropriate time frame.

You can trade options in a much lower risk manner by buying long-dated in-the-money calls, but it's also hard to make much money that way."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Fair enough, I'm in agreement about the higher risk for sure and won't be trying my hand anytime soon. Will start with my practice account. My personal blessing is that while I'm dumb, I at least realize I am dumb."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If TQQQ existed in '99 I don't think you'd have the same opinion of it. March 2020 wasn't a normal crash, it was the fastest ever.

Volatility demolishes 3x funds. If tech goes into an extended bear market TQQQ holders will be quite sad."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I generally like these 3x leveraged funds on a market correction. One example I'd used last year was SPXL, a 3x Bull S&P 500 ETF.  After I was fairly sure we were on the path to recovery (end of March 2020), I bought into that. Admittedly, I could have held longer, but I converted back to a standard S&P fund to reduce volatility and risk.

In short, anytime I see a market correction greater than 10%, I move a portion of my account into one of these leveraged funds to take advantage of the recovery."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m more supportive of leveraged ETFs than most will be in this sub, but I’ll outline the basic negatives below: 

TQQQ is 3x daily returns, which means that you need a consistent secular bull market to make money. For example, if QQQ is priced at $100 at open, moves down 1% today and up 1% tomorrow, you would have $99.99. In TQQQ, you would have $99.91. The daily movements of the underlying were the same, but QQQ is ahead. This doesn’t sound like much with 1 share at a hypothetical $100/share price, but it can potentially add up to a large amount. 

You need larger upswings to recover from the downswings. If a stock loses 50% value (e.g. $100 to $50), you need to achieve a 100% gain to get back to even ($50 back to $100). So although we saw an astounding comeback in 2020 after the COVID crash, not all recoveries are as fast and v-shaped as that was."
03/16/2021,stocks,oh boy leveraged ETFs on front page. Here we go down again....
03/16/2021,stocks,"Leveraged ETFs are good for bull runs in the market. The Nasdaq has had a pretty solid bull run since TQQQ was created, other than the coronavirus dip. However, if you want to look at a worst case scenario, look at the leveraged ETF DFEN. It crashed 92% last March and will likely take many, many years to recover, if ever. That being said, I don't think TQQQ would ever crash that badly unless we get into another dotcom bubble. It's risky to hold these, but if you can take 30 or 40 percent dips, then you'll be ok with it."
03/16/2021,stocks,"> Can someone please explain to me why holding TQQQ for long term is a bad idea?

I considered the same thing you are. However I learned why it’s a bad idea. 

> That said, it appears that TQQQ has performed incredibly well during the last 10 years (with more than 10,000% gains in the same period), even accounting for a major market crash such as that in March 2020. 

That’s because TQQQ has only existed in a bull market with 1 sub-30% crash that quickly recovered. 

> If your holding period is say around 5 years and can stomach major market crashed, is there a solid reason why you’d want to stay far away from TQQQ? 

If you bought TQQQ (assuming it existed) back in March 1999 and held, by December 2020 you’d be up 27% after more than 2 decades. If you had bought normal QQQ back in 1999, you’d be up 6x. 

The problem is with Covid, QQQ didn’t crash much. However the S&P500 did crash more so I’ll use it as an example. If you bought VOO on February 14th, you’d be up 17% as of today. If you bought UPRO (3x leveraged) on February 14th, you’d be up 12% as of today. Now take that, and multiply it across years with multiple bear markets and you get the idea. Not to mention if the market goes flat, you lose due to slight decay. 

As for holding periods. The longer you hold onto the 3x leveraged fund the less likely you are to beat the market. Since 1999, if you were to hold TQQQ for 1 year periods, 64% of the time you would’ve beaten QQQ. If you change the holding period to 5 years, you only beat the market 54% of the time. As you extend the period out the more probability drops off to the point you are only ahead if you perfectly time the market. It’s basically gambling when you hold for these shorter times. 

This is why the academics and the creators of TQQQ all concur 3x leveraged ETFs are not good long term holds. Plus the volatility most people can’t stomach. Can you stomach 70% to 90%+ crashes?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"You can hold it long term if you can meet the following conditions:

* You do not need the money for 10 years (don't take the volatility risk before retirement)
* You will not sell when there is a correction or crash
* You can make additional investments when there is a correction or crash

If we suffer a crash like the dotcom bubble you could kiss your initial investment goodbye so you'll need to rely on investing new money and having it grow in the next bull market."
03/16/2021,stocks,Informative response. Doesn’t your last paragraph though apply to non-leverages etf as well?
03/16/2021,stocks,"If the Nasdaq goes from 13,000 to 12,900 back to 13,000 do you end up with less money?"
03/16/2021,stocks,I've always wondered if you're better off shorting the 3x leveraged funds for long timeframes
03/16/2021,stocks,why do you think it will take so long to recover
03/16/2021,stocks,"Nah, you gotta run from leveraged ETFs if there is a crash. Because the damn thing will reverse split on you. ERX did that to me last March. I lost $2K, but luckily I had made $2K on TECL and had gotten out so it was a wash for me."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You’d be fucked if you did that in a market like the one we just had. But most sectors have leveraged bear ETFs like SQQQ, FAZ, etc. and you can buy those. Or buy puts on the bull versions."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You can approximate leveraged ETFs prior to their inception using tools like portfoliovisualizer.com.  For instance, if TQQQ had existed in 2000 it would have lost around 99.9% of its value in the dotcom crash, and still wouldn't have recovered.  I simulated it using 300% QQQ and -200% CASHX in Portfolio Visualizer using monthly rebalancing (actual TQQQ uses daily rebalancing).  $10,000 invested in a version of TQQQ in 2000 would be worth $3,328 today.

TQQQ in 2000's is a bit of an extreme example.  If you started any time after that, even 2008, you'd have done extraordinarily well since the 2010's were such a massive bull market for tech.  Still, to the OP's example, recovering from 8% back to 100% requires around five straight years of 70% CAGR.  That's as much as that ETF has gained in the Covid recovery.  Five straight years of Covid recovery numbers seems highly unlikely."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I owned DFEN around 40 and rode it all the way up to like 80% profit and then down during the 2019 and 2020 time period. In the end I was lucky to only have lost about $600 on it. When a leveraged stock or ETF gets too low it has a chance of a reverse split. Usually Direxion announces this at a range of about $5-$8. People know that it can reverse split so confidence in the ETF fails thus failing to gather investors to keep borrowing/leveraging money for trades.

They do the reverse split as an effort to make the ETF more attractive. Think about it, no one wants to buy penny stocks. And penny stocks are now considered anything under $5.

Also DFEN is/was heavy into Boeing I think like 20%-30% perhaps more. So when Boeing was hurt it got hurt. IMO, confidence won’t come back into DFEN until Boeing fully recovers."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I was speaking to TQQQ in this case although my conditions apply to the S&P500 based funds as well. Regarding ERX: oil, coal, and natural gas doesn't seem like something that will perform well in the long term, in my opinion."
03/16/2021,stocks,Depends on which type of leveraged fund you short ;-)
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah I understand how leveraged ETFs can hurt huge if theres a downturn that wasn’t what I was asking about. I was wondering why he thought DFEN would flounder and maybe never recover. It’s having an incredible year and seems like a great investment. It had 2 years of covid recovery level gains leading up to the crash as well. IMO there’s no reason to think the rally it’s having is doomed just because of the crash last year.
03/16/2021,stocks,Interesting. How do you define fully recovers? Both Boeing and DFEN have had an incredible year (potentially even best year) along with the covid recovery. I honestly give it another year or two before they are both back up at pre-march crash levels if they continue this run.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah most exchanges will delist anything with a share price that stays under $5 for a significant length of time, so at that point reverse splits are virtually guaranteed."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I totally agree with that. I got lured into ERX because of the low price and knew that fossils would go back up eventually. I thought I could long it like I did with TECL, which is similar to TQQQ. Just there happened to be a crash and a reverse split before this latest rise."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You gotta remember Boeing didn’t crash just because of Covid, it crashed because three of its newest line the Max8 planes crashed and entire fleets of those Max8s were grounded by the FAA, investigations ensued that showed Boeing in a bad light, and then airlines canceled orders with Boeing. Those airlines then moved their business/orders to Airbus. So Boeing has to win back its customers before confidence fully returns to the stock. DEFN was heavy into Boeing and last time I checked still showed its top holding as Boeing. Thus the two are tied together until Direxion changes its top holding and updates the investment prospectus."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Exactly that pre-March crash levels is how I define it. I actually got back in DFEN after the crash at like $12 and then sold about a month ago at $17. It only ripped up after I sold. But I held it for months and it didn’t move much.

Most everything is past pre-March crash levels and those two are nowhere close. I agree they both have had a great run if you got in post-crash, but again lots of people got burned it has to do with confidence and lack of confidence keeps demand at a low. Gotta remember the stock market is priced on supply and demand. Hence why $GME is riding high right now. Lack of supply and high demand."
03/16/2021,stocks,It’ll be sold when it hits the strike... not trying to be an ass but I think you should learn the basics more before you start selling

03/16/2021,stocks,Just getting started and already thinking about paying taxes.  Man you are a decent guy
03/16/2021,stocks,You will pay on your taxes next year for all profits made during the year
03/16/2021,stocks,"The brokerage you use will send you a tax form at the end of the year.  When filing your taxes as you normally do include the  form provided by the brokerage to account for capital gains or tax breaks for loss.  I personally use turbo tax which can link with different brokerages and upload required information. In short, you file it with your normal taxes the following year."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes you report your gains and losses when you file. It wouldn't make much sense for a brokerage to take taxes out for you, what would they do when you sell at losses? Kick in extra money to cover the tax break you'd get? What about wash-sales they would have to give back or take out the tax adjustment that was made at time of the sell. That's just extra bookkeeping that a brokerage wouldn't really benefit from taking on."
03/16/2021,stocks,"No, you will pay  the taxes.  Make sure you set some aside for tax day."
03/16/2021,stocks,You can look at your statements monthly on your Webull acccount and this is also will be where you get your tax forms at year end
03/16/2021,stocks,"Regular trading by regular people is done all year round. When you file your taxes at the beginning of the year, some of the questions asked will be ""how much did you make at your job"" and, ""did you make or lose money in the stock market"".

Businesses don't get to wait that long like us, they have to report or pay their taxes quarterly or monthly in some cases.

You don't have to worry about paying any taxes on 2021 trades until the 2022 tax season. Make sure you keep track of your earnings and set some aside so you aren't surprised"
03/16/2021,stocks,You pay when you file taxes for that year. Nobody takes taxes out before that

03/16/2021,stocks,Thank you! I was already thinking about that. Assuming they take out 30% at worst in short term I’ll always keep that much on the side from all my profits.
03/16/2021,stocks,I didn’t think about that! Thanks man!
03/16/2021,stocks,Can I write tax off using my losses?

03/16/2021,stocks,Thank you!
03/16/2021,stocks,Thank you!
03/16/2021,stocks,"If your parents have capital gains, watch the process how they complete their taxes."
03/16/2021,stocks,37% is max capitol gains and you can write off $3000 in losses. I may be wrong about that though.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes, and no. Losses up to $3,000 will reduce your taxable income. Losses beyond 3,000 can be carried to the next year, but the 3,000 cap still exists.

Example:
Year 1: -$10,000
Year 2: +$5,000

You can only claim -$3,000 for year one, but you can carry some of that remainder to year 2. If year 2 is +$5,000, you can use year 1's loss to only have to pay +$2,000 worth of tax. Further, because you lost so much in year 1, you can also claim -$3,000 in year 3, then -$1,000 in year 4. The chances of anyone being profitable 3 years in a row are low (I haven't!), but the idea is there."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You’re taxed on net profits, so your losses will be factored into whatever you get charged in taxes"
03/16/2021,stocks,They don’t from my knowledge but I’ll ask for sure!
03/16/2021,stocks,Thank you! I thought 30% was max but I’ll account for 37% on all profits just to be safe!
03/16/2021,stocks,"Awesome thanks for your great input!!!

This has helped me lots!! And im sure others reading too!!"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Literally like half of these comments under here are about gambling on SPCE, PLTR, etc. Which is what I assume somewhat what you already did if you lost 30% of your stimulus already.

I would focus on saving an emergency fund before investing anything. Its better to be safe with that first 10k or so in case you do ever need it for something important and unpredictable. Then you don't have to sell any of your holdings to pay for that event.

Then throw your extra money after that into SPY, VTI or another index fund and just add to it consistantly. With what seems like a huge workload its very unlikely you'll be able to effectively monitor the market to more actively trade. 

If you try to Meme-Stock your way to a 400% gain, it's much more likely you'll lose 50% instead, and then you're in an even worse position. Especially if you can't monitor it 24/7 to avoid any large drops. Investing is taking advantage of compound gains over multiple years, trading is taking advantage of short term fluctuations."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I too congratulate you on your turnaround.   

Be aware that people making five times what you do most likely live paycheck to paycheck too.  They just do it at a more comfortable level.

I started as an advisor 40 years ago and am now retired.  So I have seen intimate details of people in all levels of financial situations.

First thing I'm going to tell you is to stop investing.  You aren't in a position to lose 30% of your cash.

Second, stop and look around.  Do you see people making more money than you that are younger than you?  Of course you do.  This is where you can make the biggest impact on your family's financial stability.

Ask yourself what you could do to improve your situation? The answer is to get qualified or certified in something that pays better.  I know welders who make over $150k per year.  They aren't just your run of the mill welder though.  They have certifications like with the Dept of Defense.  

My own daughter in law took a 6 week course in a software program called Agile.  She started out making $60k and after five years and five companies has a work from home job in project management making $110k per year.    

My son joined the Marines at 22, did two tours in Afghanistan and  is now a city cop making $60k in Orlando. He has  never set foot in college.  He did get about two years of ""college credits"" he can use towards a degree but I don't see that happening.

Prior to the Marines he got a job at ATT and learned to splice fiber  optic cable.  They were paying him stupid money for a high school degree.

The point  is you don't have to spend four years on a college degree to make much more than day labor pays.  Take any extra money and get certified or qualified in something that is a specific job.  Hopefully, it is also something you like to do.

Once you are settled in your new life, put away the cash for emergencies and then start investing.

Go do something that will change your life."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It’s great that you are working two jobs and day labor it really shows that you have turned your life around and want to provide for your family. 

I would suggest you stop investing altogether especially in meme stocks that you think will get you rich overnight. Use the money instead on your education. That will pay off more than your gambling in meme stocks. In the long run once you have a good income you can go back to investing in good s&p funds."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Thank you everyone. Like 1 redditor said, ""It's hard to see other people becoming millionaires overnight"" when there's people like us breaking our backs for chump change. You guys are great thanks for the encouraging comments everyone"
03/16/2021,stocks,"You're not a “fuck up.” You're 3 people's dad and a husband. It doesn't matter if you're having trouble making ends meet and have to work 16 hours a day. If you're a good father and a good husband, and you're trying to be a better person, then you're already not a fuck up. Period. My favorite memories of my father was when we were poor and I was sleeping on a mattress in our attic. My dad was my hero, how much he had in a 401k didn't matter to me.

Only later did I realise our “back yard camping expeditions” were because he couldn't pay the power bill. 

As for investing. I wouldn't do it yet if I were you. Think about all the ways you could make money without your body (your body will start to fail). Maybe call centers or phone sales. Maybe night classes. Maybe work on becoming an accountant. Maybe customer service or tech support. Something entry level, it won't pay well but that's because you don't have to pay with your health. 

The problem is that you actually care about investing returns because you're trying to make ends meet. You have to not care about the money to stay logical. Increasing your earning potential is way more important than market returns. 

Have you tried sales? It's the number one career I see people get at entry-level no-education required $15 and hour, where people radically increase their earnings above $75k within only a couple years"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think it is wonderful you turned your life around. With unemployment so high, it is tough finding a decent job. Do you have a skill that is in demand or an aptitude for one? If so, the time spent getting trained or an education is an investment that will pay you dividends.

As for stock investing, the needs of your family come first. You need a financial cushion for emergencies or unexpected bills like an auto repair. Above all, discuss you plans with your wife.  The two greatest sources of disagreements between couples is money and how to raise your children."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Investing is not a get rich quick scheme. Trading on the other hand, you can do well in a short period of time, but it can also take you to zero faster than you can blink. The SP500 has been on a consistent upward trajectory the last 12 months, so what moves are you making that has left you losing money in SPY?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Never forget the first rule of investing. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.

That being said, depending on when you got in, February was tough for a lot of people. Don't think its always going to be like that.

If you're not comfortable with the investments you've made, you might consider hiring an investment firm to do it for you. It takes away a little bit of the stress.

While there are safer plays, and riskier plays..there are no sure things. You might be able to get some good picks from other people here, but how are you going to react if those picks decrease in value too?

Its really hard to see millionaires being made overnight on really risky bets, and a little luck. FOMO is a real bitch..trust me, i know. 

Try to learn something from the 30% that you lost, and create a new plan of attack. If long term growth is what you're looking for, there might be better options than buying stocks.

Just spitballing here. Good luck with whatever you decide to go with."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It sucks to put money into something and watch it shrink, but that's the nature of the game with stocks.  You might look for some lower growth stuff that pays a dividend, or other investments that offer compounding interest.  (You sound young, so compounding interest is something you can take advantage of more so than an older investor.)  


The best thing I can tell you, is always be on the lookout for better employment and don't be afraid to move if that move will take you to a better opportunity.  Tougher to do with a family, but it can be done.  If you do day labor, consider some type of trade school.  Construction trades make solid money.  You can't rely on the stock market as a steady stream of income with little or no cash.  (You might read about super success stories, but for everyone one of them, there are 100 failure stories.  It's just not that easy.  I've always said, it's sports betting for smart people.)"
03/16/2021,stocks,"(Everything below is what I'd do if I were in your position. I'm learning about individual stocks, and the market generally; for me, that will take years of study. Take what's helpful and leave the rest.)

First of all: Congratulations on everything you've accomplished so far. The path you've taken has been really difficult and you obviously work extremely hard.

Second: (This and the next points are for non-essential money only.) You really do need some liquid savings. Everyone tells you $10,000, which is useless to someone with dependents working 2 jobs, much less 3--yes, I've been there. But put away $1-2000 someplace safe and don't touch it. Rainy days are inevitable.

Third: Sock 75% of everything else into a high yield index fund. I recommend Vanguard. The stock market really does climb over decades. Time and interest *will* make you wealthy if you start right now.

Fourth: Everything else, play with stocks. It really does have to be money you're prepared to lose; this is roulette, not blackjack, except for people like hedge fundies...and as WSB showed the world, even the fundies can't count every card in the decks. (This doesn't apply to people trained in quantitative analysis who trade options, as Lily recently proved, but I'm assuming that that's not true of you; it's certainly not true of me.)

The advice above about stock not being a loss until you sell is correct--but waiting for even a good stock to climb again can take years, and is never guaranteed. That's why you only gamble with what you can do without--once the money is in, it's gone until you sell. Green numbers on a screen don't buy groceries."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Great for you man! Honestly I was in the same boat about 10 years ago (minus the family situation). I've taken a liking to trading, but I'll tell you this... I was far more comfortable when I was investing, than I am trading. When my holdings pulled back 10-15% I could handle it, knowing it's temporary. But when I lose 10% overnight it creates a certain level of stress -you get used to it, but still. Of course there's days when you jump up 10-20%. But, hell, I lost on last weeks TSLA calls I got for this week, 2k... that's a lot to lose in 3 days... hell that's a months worth of bills for me.  The wild swings are a bit much some days, and I definitely wouldn't be risking it if I had a family to provide for. But my lady and I are very much independent financially, and I know no one will be upset if my brokerage account ends up hitting zero, so I trade.

I would suggest what many here already have -build up a saving, and THEN invest A LOT of the money you have leftover after bills. None of the crap you see on wallstreetbets or any of that. Solid companies with a solid history, or ETFs. And just watch that account swell up over 10 years. But it's important to first build up a savings you can rely on for a few months in case of job loss or some medical expense. And what folks have been saying about looking for education, I think this is very important. I'm no example here, as I dropped out of the business program I was taking when I found a good job, but I'll repeat that I don't have a family, and I'm currently taking care of myself.

Interesting note about trading. I made 6k last week. I lost about half of those gains already and it's f\*\*\*ing Tuesday lol. It's wild... But while I was just investing in solid companies and ETFs I outperformed all the major indexes (last years bull run helped a lot obviously). And when the market retracted last month, my all time performance was still better than the S&P500 in that time frame. Trading, I don't think my performance is any better... it's just one day I might be up a lot, and then I lose a lot, and this goes on over and over, but in the greater picture I haven't done much better than I would have just buying and holding. I hope this is some help for you.

And I wish you the best my dude. That's a shitty thing to go through, but if it helps us turn things around, well that's what's most important. Props to you for moving on and embracing a new life. Much love.

EDIT: I keep 2 accounts. One for sustained growth for my future and one for day trading. I feel it's important to separate them, and to start with the investment account first."

All the while buying fractional shares of BA and reinvesting the dividends or buying one single share of SPYD every month. Then if bought BA after Boeing finally recovers take that money out and look for somewhere else to put it, and perhaps using half of that for more Options trading.

03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes.  You can absolutely lose all the way.  You can buy something that goes belly up.  You can also buy something that crashes and just stays low, effectively tying up that money in a lost cause that could be cashed out and reinvested elsewhere.

Let's say you buy X stock at 10 and it drops to 5 and stays there for 5 years.  You could have sold at a loss in year 1 and that money, if reinvested even in a low yield CD would make more than it just sitting there doing nothing for the next 5.  If you're holding something that you really don't see a hope for, its best to dump it and move on.  (The problem here is being right about that!  You can just as easily panic sell and dump something that bounces back up.  It boils down to doing your DD.  You really have to know what you're buying.   ...and selling.)"

**Pros:**

1. If 1 token = 1mi, it's psychologically easier to pay 5 tokens vs $22 for a ride.
2. Same for tipping, 0.2 tokens ""seems"" small
3. People will purchase tokens in advance, potentially for multiple weeks/months of future use.
4. Multi-country trips no longer require different currencies or conversions.
5. Uber immediately boosts revenue by 2-3% by saving on credit card transaction fees.
6. Potential anonymity, token transfers, etc?

**Cons:**

1. Educating people to a new system
2. Development costs
3. Fiat-to-token conversion fees
4. Might not be as lucrative to Uber as a monthly subscription.

so. here´s my thought process. I really do believe in he company long term. but I hate having cash locked up in positions that do not yield anything in return. 

I am considering selling at a loss right now, to reinvest into some stock with more short term upsides. anything that beats covid drops or i alredy in the process of recovering. after making up the loss with that I would re-enter at current prices. then resume long term holding. 

I would buy more to average out lower , but all  my other positions seem to work out decent.

Currently have May 25 strikes I sold for $5 a couple of weeks ago.  Worst case scenario I own more shares with a $20 cost basis, which I'm willing to do all day long.

But have the companies been getting exponentially better? 

I dont have an opinion on that, but seing this explosive growth scares me from investing. Thats why im asking for your personal opinion: have tech stocks / stocks been growing at an irrational rate the past few years, or is this an optical illusion? (see attatched images below), or it due to the new wave of young investors?

Basicly what im Asking is if its normal for the stock market to grow exponentially, and in that case if the current growth rate is normal.

**Porsche Automobil Holding SE** (“Porsche SE“) is a listed holding company and holds a stake of 53.3 percent of the ordinary shares of Volkswagen AG.

Porsche SE was created in June 2007 by renaming the old **Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG** (usually shortened to **Porsche AG**) and became a holding company. 

At the same time, the new Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG (Porsche AG) was created for the car manufacturing business.

So Porsche SE is the old company with a new name. And the Porsche AG is a new company with the old name. 

The Porsche AG was acquired by Volkswagen AG. 

To make things more complicated. There‘re two types of shares of the Volkswagen AG. **Preferred stock** (VOW3.DE) and **Common stock** (VOW.DE)

Usually you want to buy the preferred stock if you don’t care about voting rights. These are the shares that are usually meant if someone talks about Volkswagen stock and is traded at a much higher volume.

---

&nbsp;

Good evening fellas, Professor Flux here, bringing you some quality DD on $WMT. I originally wrote this post for /r/WSB, but figured it would also be useful here. I censored out most of the ""ape talk"", but if some slipped through the cracks, let me know and I'll edit it out! 

&nbsp;

Although most people view Walmart as a boring, boomer dividend stock, I strongly believe that they’re poised to reclaim their ATHs over the coming months. What initially caught my eye about this entire play was the [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). A steep 11% dropoff after earnings led to an aggressive bounce, which was then promptly held at the longtime support level of 132/133. This leads us to the overarching question we need to answer *before* we get into the DD - Why did Walmart plummet in the first place?

&nbsp;

---

#Why did Walmart Plunge?

Before we get into the DD, it’s important that we understand *why* Walmart dropped 11% in the first place. With overall sales *increasing* by 11%, eCommerce sales gapping up by 70%, a 20 billion dollar stock buyback, a dividend hike, and more, it may seem polarizing that Walmart *dropped* after reporting such strong earnings. 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, it seems as if investors (and algos) weren’t happy about the potential ER guidance, as well as the abundance of covid related costs. It’s no secret that operating expenses went up due to COVID, and as a result, Walmart’s operating margins took a hit to the tune of $1.1 billion. Although temporary, investors didn’t like that COVID related expenses increased due to the overall number of covid cases increasing (go figure). 

&nbsp;

Furthermore, in the ER call, Walmart announced they were allocating more money towards future growth, which offput investors (for reasons beyond me). Walmart plans to invest 14 billion dollars to supply chain automation and additional technologies, while also looking to rollout Walmart+ to more users. They’re also looking to increase the average employee wage to above 15$, resulting in better service, and improved quality of life for Walmart employees. Walmart continues to build upon their next generation business model, investing in automation to fuel future sales and earnings growth. Unfortunately, short term investors dislike this, as these investments take away from the potential earnings of 2021, yet those with the foresight to look past this, see this as a viable, and necessary cost for sustained long term growth.

&nbsp;

---

#Earnings Report Summary

First things first, we need to go over the ER numbers, which were bullish as fuck. On  February 18th, Walmart reported that :

- Overall sales increased by over 11%
- Overall revenue was up 7% on the quarter
- Spending per visit increased by a factor of 22% 
- They added **$10 billion dollars to its annual free cash flow**, as that metric jumped to $26 billion from $14.6 billion in the prior year
eCommerce sales increased 70%
- General expenses were *lower*, resulting in overall operating income increasing by 17%, even after accounting for COVID related expenses
- The dividend was increased for the 48th consecutive year in a row
- They are instantiating a new 20 ***billion*** dollar share buyback program

&nbsp;

These numbers alone are enough to warrant a *jump* in Walmart’s share price, but in fact, the opposite occurred, with Walmart tanking 11%. Fortunately for us, this provides us with an awesome dip buying opportunity! From fundamentals, alone Walmart is an awesome investment at this price.

&nbsp;

---

#Underlying Catalysts

Luckily for us, aside from rock solid fundamentals, Walmart also has plenty of “hidden” catalysts in store, which could easily lead to a gap up in stock price.

&nbsp;

**Stimulus**

I hate to be that guy using the “stimulus” cop-out, but on average, the new stimulus cheques are going to end up in the pockets of retail stores. Sure, “on paper”, stimulus is going to positively affect *all* companies, but it’s important to understand that retail stores such as Walmart, Home Depot, Dollar General, etc, tend to **benefit the most from it**. The average American isn’t going to be buying a fucking Tesla, or a brand new iPhone with his newly minted $1400. I’m sure some people will, no doubt, but on average, these stimulus cheques are going to be spent at retail stores, for mundane, everyday things such as groceries, home furnishings, sporting goods, cheap electronics, etc, all of which is supplied by Walmart and similar retailers. Theres is a fuckload of stimulus money hitting the banks of average, everyday Americans, and most of it inevitably *will* end up being spent at Walmart. If you don’t believe me, the CEO of Walmart literally [verified all this too.] (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-spent-their-stimulus-checks-on-discretionary-goods-such-as-bikes-video-games-and-clothes-target-and-walmart-ceos-say-2020-05-20)

&nbsp;

Another null-point to note is that many “savvy” Americans are going to look to invest their stimulus cheques. Although most cheques will end up getting stolen by MMs, some will still end up being invested in regular ass shares, bringing up the *entire* market, increasing Walmart’s value with it.

&nbsp;

**Partnerships, Expansions, and Diversified Growth Opportunities**

Although not explicitly advertised, Walmart has many diversified opportunities for continued growth under their belts. I’m not going to comprehensively write about them all, since each would be an *entire* DD post in and of itself, but refer to the list below to get a comprehensive summary.

&nbsp;

- Back in June, [Walmart partnered with Shopify](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace). As a result, thousands of sellers from Shopify would join the Walmart Marketplace, increasing traffic and generating more revenue from fees product transactions.
- In August, [Walmart partnered with Instacart](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/walmart-and-instacart-partner-in-fight-against-amazons-whole-foods.html) to provide same day grocery delivery. This takes market share away from other grocery stores, while also combating services like Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime. This partnership helps Walmart establish a dominating position in the online grocery market.
- Back in July, [Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-sells-its-indian-stores-to-flipkart-11595484002) allowing Walmart to aggressively expand into India, further growing their business, and profits.
- Along a similar vein, Walmart has been expanding all around the world, to places such as [China](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/walmart-china-stores) and [Africa](https://talkbusiness.net/2018/09/walmarts-7-year-gamble-in-africa-slowly-paying-off/), creating significant opportunities for the continued growth of the company.
- In North America, [Walmart+ is being rolled out to more and more eligible Americans on a month by month basis](https://www.statista.com/topics/1451/walmart/). Soon enough, all of America will have access to Walmart+, drastically increasing profits.

&nbsp;

**The Forgotten TikTok Deal**

Remember the whole TikTok debacle? No? Understandable. Although it’s been a while, it’s technically *still* in play. Although it was promptly swept under the rug after the presidency change, there is still potential for the [TikTok acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/with-tiktok-deal-walmart-could-gain-a-front-row-seat-to-the-next-generation.html) to go through. As per the original agreement, Walmart will be granted a 7.5% stake in the newly founded company, which would be incredibly bullish for Walmart. Walmart would control and engage in an intensely valued platform, while having a front row seat to the next generation of consumers. The possibilities of this partnership are endless, but for the time being, it’s still in limbo. Regardless, it’s still another point us investors need to consider, as news could come out at any moment, causing Walmart to rocket.

&nbsp;

#An Ideal Entry

As touched upon in the intro, what initially caught my eye about $WMT *before* I started my research, was the [price action](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). After the ER it plunged down to it’s $126 support level, bounced hard, and then came to rest at an even stronger level of support, at $132. This level of support serves perfectly as our entry point. At this level, a move to the downside is *extremely* unlikely, since algos and institutes gobble up shares likely candy when WMT is trading under $132. Furthermore, even if the price does move against us, we have levels of support at $126 and $125, allowing us to average down on our position in the unlikely event of another downside move. We have an awesome opportunity for entry here, alongside great downside protection.

&nbsp;

There are multiple ways you can play this bounce. You can go with ye old faithful, and “buy the fucking dip” like Warren Buffet does, loading up on shares and reaping the rewards of stock growth and dividends at the same time. Alternatively, for those with a greater stomach for risk, you can look to pick up **$140 C 4/16**, **$140 C 05/21**, or **$160 C 06/18**. Each of these options are relatively cheap, and offer an immense upside. Furthermore, with these longer dated contracts, you won’t get bitten by theta as badly, and will have plenty of time to reap the rewards, and for the price to become ITM.

&nbsp;

#Bearish Counterpoints

No DD would be complete without a bear thesis. Alongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I’m no better than a pump-and-dumper. In this section I’ll look to address some of the overarching concerns that many investors may have about the stock.

&nbsp;

The various expansions and investments Walmart is making are very expensive in nature. If they fail to succeed in their ventures, it would be a colossal failure, and would ultimately be a huge revenue sink and waste of capital. Although they’re not necessarily difficult or risky, we need these investments and expansions to be successful to ensure the future growth of Walmart as a company. Another thing to consider is that these growth ventures may already be priced in. Although the growth cases for these scenarios have not yet been properly documented, it’s still something we as investors need to consider.

&nbsp;

Next, some are afraid that raising the minimum wage of Walmart employees up to 15$ will eat into company revenues. Although this may be true right out the gate, it will likely be shadowed by the fact that eventually *all* companies may have to do such a shift due to government policy. Walmart doing this *first* may initially be a negative, but it will ultimately have to happen at some point down the road. If a minimum wage policy is not enforced by the government, this policy *will* eat into Walmart's revenues, but may potentially be offset due to the enhanced quality of employees Walmart may be able to acquire with the newly increased wages. Time will tell.

&nbsp;

Lastly, through Walmart+ and their eCommerce department, Walmart enters a space heavily saturated by specialty online stores, which may currently have the edge over generalist marketplaces. In the short term, while they expand, they’ll have to wrestle away market share from these specialized brands, while retaining customers, which is no easy feat. Fortunately for Walmart, this likely won’t be an issue in the long term (hooray globalization), but short term, it’s still something we as investors need to consider. Furthermore, one also needs to consider that Amazon is working within this sector as well. Although Walmart has been able to compete with and wrestle away some of Amazon’s share, we are unsure if this growth will be sustained into the future.

#Conclusion

All in all, following a healthy earnings report, a nice dip in Walmart’s price provides us with an awesome trading opportunity. With rock solid fundamentals, many bullish catalysts in play, and stimulus right around the corner, Walmart is poised to reclaim its ATHs, and make us some money. This play is incredibly safe, so grab some shares or options, and enjoy the ride! If you like my posts and want more finance content, you can find links to my socials on my profile!

**TLDR :** $WMT has awesome fundamentals, many bullish catalysts, and is poised to benefit from stimulus. BTFD!!!!"
03/16/2021,stocks,Brilliant DD. I managed to buy the dip last week around 130$ which I believe is quite good. It’s a steady company which is able to perform during all economic times. The huge investments are only good for me who is planning to hold on to it for a long time. And like you said it has many underrated catalysts.
03/16/2021,stocks,WMT is that stock that i’d love to own but I hate the company too much to invest in it.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m really into it but it’s definitely a slow mover sometimes. I got in at $116 in October 2019 and sold at $120 in June 2020. (Though there were a couple of nice dividends in between.) 

But I think it’ll continue to trade sideways until some of these growth plays start to show up in earnings more consistently, and we’ll have to see how much e-commerce sales drop off as the pandemic ends."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I like it and I bought 10 shares just before the dip. I am a suburban dad and I absolutely love pickup. I get almost all my groceries through pickup since July. At times during the holidays I couldn't get an appointment. I think this will catch on. Valuation wise, it's not cheap and it's difficult to grow revenues when you're at half a trillion already. I'm looking at Target too, similar relative value but likely more room to grow. Regardless, convenience is changing big box retail. I can't stand walking aisles for an hour anymore."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Great DD thanks for sharing. If I look at valuation relative to historicals it was trading about 1 std. deviation above the 2-year trailing average bf p/e ratio and retraced to 2-year historical average after reporting earnings. Do you not think this is fully valued or do you think multiple expansion is warranted given the DD you have here and the implication of the higher future growth? Also, how do you think about the mix differential with 25% share in the super-competitive grocery market and much lower share in general merchandise (6% share) where AMZN dominates coming out of COVID impacting this?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Excellent DD but according to me, it's a retirement stock. Keep buying it like a SIP, enjoy the dividends and hold it until retirement. If you're looking for short-medium term returns like a year or so, this may not be the stock"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Solid DD IMO. As someone who bought June 18 $135 and $140c on the way down when the underlying was at that strike, I'd certainly love to see more upward price action so I could at least break even, but I'm not sure it's coming in this span of time."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Gonna buy once divi is stopped, they start losing money and selling NFT groceries.That’s the only way to reach 2 trillion mcap!"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Appreciate it man, thank you!"
03/16/2021,stocks,I’d love to hear your reasons for hating it if you feel like sharing (although I probably already know what many of them will be).
03/16/2021,stocks,"You're not the only one, I've heard this perspective quite often."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Do you own FB, by chance?"
03/16/2021,stocks,It also has an extreemly large amount of shares outstanding.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Its the not paying workers well, which in turn makes them not care about their job. It’s half for what the corporation is doing and half that their stores are some of the most miserable places on earth to go too."
03/16/2021,stocks,No. But I do own AMZN and LMT so I understand the contradiction. For some reason I just despise walmart.
03/16/2021,stocks,They really are. It's depressing as fuck to be at walmart.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I wasn’t trying to expose a contradiction. I was just curious. We all have different companies we don’t like. Usually for good reason. I’m mainly an index investor, so I own them whether I like it or not 😅"

Also short sellers and Reddit attacks in February shows the potential and interest from the minor investors/traders. $ENCAVIS is another European potential with short positions."
03/16/2021,stocks,Someone follows Maydorns Meinung then ;-)
03/16/2021,stocks,Where is Daimler located in the same city as Varta? Aren’t they in Ellwangen? That’s not Stuttgart.

2021-03-16 18:20:42,stocks,"How Tech Heavy Is Too Tech Heavy? So I recently started investing and have done a fair amount of research to design a portfolio that I think is pretty moderate with enough long term upside.  I am 26 years old and plan to max out a Roth IRA every year and am in this for the long haul.  I really just tried to pick companies that I personally believe in and am connected to in some way.  The only exposure outside of tech that I really get is through VTI/VXUS and I am wondering if these index funds provide enough diversity or if I’m still way too tech heavy.  I appreciate any input as I still have a ton to learn!

VTI: 45%
VXUS: 20%
AAPL: 10%
MSFT: 5%
AMZN: 5%
PENN: 2.5%
ICLN: 2.5%
MSOS: 2.5%
ARKK: 2.5%

03/16/2021,stocks,is it even possible?  most of the world runs on tech and spends its leisure time on tech
03/16/2021,stocks,I think you're fine
03/16/2021,stocks,101%
03/16/2021,stocks,when you start feeling panicked due to Nasdaq dropping around 10%
03/16/2021,stocks,Portfolio looks great.
03/16/2021,stocks,"If your looking to be more diverse look at the AAPL,  MSFT, AMZN exposure. Those stocks are already included in the ETFs. AAPL is 8ish percent of VTI. I'm not saying that's good or bad, just that you should be aware and decide if its what you want."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Look fine.  I like the cash disclosure, always good to purposely have some available."
03/16/2021,stocks,"When you feel it’s overweight, or when you can’t stomach volatility of one position. There really is no magic number, it’s dependent on the investor."

03/16/2021,stocks,Increase that apple position
03/16/2021,stocks,is VTI the best EFT out their? i am looking at EFT and this seems to pop up a lot.
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm aiming for a similar portfolio. I was considering adding like 5% of some sort of small cap eft like VTWG for more diversity.
03/16/2021,stocks,Just max tax advantaged accounts with index funds and pick stocks you like in a taxable account
03/16/2021,stocks,No portfolio is too tech heavy except maybe if you're 300% long QQQ and 200% short SPY
03/16/2021,stocks,Is this planned to be your roth allocation or taxable brokerage account?
03/16/2021,stocks,VTI around 40% tech itself so you just adding tech exposure with aapl msft and others on top
03/16/2021,stocks,"Tech is literally the future, and also the present. I will remain tech-heavy because tech is not going anywhere."
03/16/2021,stocks,Maybe if a solar flare hit earth or something and all power shut down
03/16/2021,stocks,Right. Tech isn’t one sector. It’s many different sectors that often get lumped into one. As long as you’re diversified within tech you should be fine.
03/16/2021,stocks,You're joking but it's perfectly possible to pair trade QQQ/SPY to essentially bet on tech relative to the market
03/16/2021,stocks,"If NASDAQ drops 10%, the surrounding sectors and sometimes even industries often feel that crunch."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah I know that VTI holds a pretty sizable amount of AAPL, MSFT, and AMZN and I’m cool with it.  If it didn’t I would probably be in Apple more than 10% as I really like the company."
03/16/2021,stocks,"what would you say VTI's weak point is, if someone wanted to base a portfolio around it for like a retirement account? can you get away with just going 100% VTI, assuming you're in 20s/30s?"
03/16/2021,stocks,Isn't AAPL 4.7% of VTI?
03/16/2021,stocks,In an IRA there is no reason to hold cash. Your investment horizon should be 10+ years so you’re better off keeping all your money in long-term plays.
03/16/2021,stocks,And pull some out of what VTI?
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m not an expert, but it seems like the most popular exposure to most of the US market."
03/16/2021,stocks,"First of all it's ETF not EFT. Second is yes it's a pretty good ETF (no such thing as ""best""), diversified across the US stock market and low fees."
03/16/2021,stocks,Roth allocation.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Tell that Nokia ,BlackBerry ,MySpace or dozens of other companies.

Yes tech doesn't get anywhere, but companies come and go faster than in any other sector."

03/16/2021,stocks,Then we'd have bigger things to worry about then our stocks.
03/16/2021,stocks,Except for last month where NASDAQ dropped 10% while Dow Jones barely budged.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Cool, You'd be surprised by the amount of people who don't. There's nothing wrong with concentrating if you're aware and its the right 'fit'. Proper diversity is just one method to lower risk, not the best choice in all situations, for all people."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Check out JL Collins, his blog, or his book The Simple Path to Wealth.

&#x200B;

He recommends for most people (even more so for someone who is young) to go 100% into VTSAX (the mutual fund version of VTI, so VTI would work too).

His reasoning is that it is simple, it removes emotions, it is diversified and with how global the economy has become is even diversified in other countries' markets. 

While that isn't what I do, there are a number of times when I think I should given it's simplicty"
03/16/2021,stocks,That's the dollar cost average folk's bread and butter. You're virtually guaranteed to get market average returns by going 100% VTI or similar funds. It's a perfectly acceptable if slightly aggressive retirement account staple.
03/16/2021,stocks,Thought it was more but I said that from memory. Have to pull up it's holdings to be sure.
03/16/2021,stocks,Think you missed the point.  Cash not to have cash.  Cash as a flexible buying tool.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah that’s what I’d do, this isn’t financial advice but Apple has outperformed the sp500 and Nasdaq consistently for decades, I’d say it’s got more upside and less downside than the total market"
03/16/2021,stocks,"i have had it in my watch list for a while, I was thinking one of Disney or VTI to move away from the tech stocks. I guess ill look into it some more."
03/16/2021,stocks,"agreed, tech indexes will probably hold the best risk/reward ratio over the next many decades in the broader sense, but some of these super speculative tech companies operating at a loss are going to burn people hard"
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah. Don't go all in on one tech company.
03/16/2021,stocks,Factual
03/16/2021,stocks,"I just checked. Maybe you're confusing it with QQQ, that has like 11%"
03/16/2021,stocks,If your portfolio always consists of 2.5% cash then you are always holding cash.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Just so you're aware, VTI is weighted by market-cap so tech presence is still a heavy part of it. It's 33% technology, with a large part of that being the big tech companies.

Of course this would change in the future if tech becomes less dominant, it would conversely become a smaller part of VTI over time."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If it does, then it does... sure.  I’m not this person, but the only reason I would have cash, would be to buy more and it would be a fluctuating amount."
2021-03-16 18:15:48,stocks,"Need some indicator advices. Hey Community! 
After only investing for longterm in value stocks I want to get more familiar in trading with chart analysis and indicators.

Here comes my question: Since there are hundreds of them, what indicators do u use most frequently and why? 
I am currently using especially RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands and Fibunacci Retracements. Am I missing something important or do u have a recommendation for me? 

Thank u all, appreciate ur help!"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I am no expert, but from everything I've read so far, researched and experienced, chart indicators are not the best way to pick stocks for long term value investment.

Best to look at financial indicators to draw up a short list then deep dive from there using the balance sheet and background checking."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't consider myself a chartist, but I do use charts as my primary source.  I trade sector ETF's.  I use a simple PPO(65,250,22) to give me the trend, up, down or sideways.  I also use ratio charts.  Go to [stockcharts.com](https://stockcharts.com) (its free) and use this symbol:  XRT:$SPX, This is the Retail ETF over (divided by) the S&P 500.   

Look down at the indicator section for an indicator called  Percent Price Oscillator (PPO).   Change the PPO numbers to 65,250,22.

The strategy is pretty simple.  When the PPO line crosses up, you buy and when it crosses down you sell.  The chart shows you XRT crossed up on 5/6/2020 and is still up.  Since then XRT is up about 160% while the $SPX is up under 40%.  

This is a ""Relative"" strength approach.  Looking at the chart it goes from lower left to upper right.  This means XRT is going up faster than $SPX.   

By using sector ETFs, I don't have to research any specific stock so earnings reports and news of changes to the CEO type stuff don't affect me.

If you want to have a lot of fun, don't buy XRT when it crosses up, but instead buy RETL, the 3X Retail ETF.  From that same date it is up over 1100%.  You have to have the stomach for volatility though to play in that arena."
03/16/2021,stocks,Keltner channels and 3 Wave TA
03/16/2021,stocks,"My advice is to keep it simple.  Start with candlestick patterns, supply and demand zones, and moving averages.  The other stuff can help confirm signals but price and volume are the key."
03/16/2021,stocks,fuck trading stay at investing
03/16/2021,stocks,"So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."
03/16/2021,stocks,Thanks for your comment. For me I don’t want to use chart indicators to do pick stocks for long term value investment. I’d rather use it for short term swing trading and to find opportunities to buy more stocks of my current investments.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Thank you so much for this explanation! Was not aware of the PPO. XRT is not tradable at the exchanges I use, but I will do my research if it is possible to follow this strategy from Europe. 

I guess my risk tolerance is pretty high, so the 3X sounds perfect for me! Will do some back testing with this strategy."
03/16/2021,stocks,Thank you! Will do some research on those.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I was already taking a quick look into candlestick patterns, but felt like reading kn coffee grounds. Maybe I should dive deeper in that topic."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Investing should still be the main thing I do. In my humble opinion it just feels right to at least understand the basics, maybe use it to find a good entry point or to use indicators as an early warning system to see if a speculative stock might crash."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Ah, ok, sorry I misunderstood your help request.  No worries and good luck in your future investments 😁 💸"
03/16/2021,stocks,"You can use ratio charts for anything.  Consider the second symbol the stock or index you are trying to outperform.  You could put anything in there as long as they are related.  

For instance you could take an ETF or mutual fund over there, put the fund symbol second and the individual stocks in the fund each as the first position.  Look at the charts.  Which charts seem to be going up the most.  Buy those and leave the others alone."
03/16/2021,stocks,It starts to make sense once you get a feel for what the candlesticks represent and how the patterns reflect underlying investor psychology and supply/demand.
2021-03-16 18:15:05,stocks,"Corsair $CRSR DD - Double Your Investment Safely! Position 1: https://imgur.com/a/GlUVtqT  
Position 2: 4/16, 5/21, 8/20 calls  

Corsair $CRSR makes high end PC peripherals and other pc/gaming parts. They are also making a huge push to capture revenue from content creators, which has a much higher margin. They are quickly becoming a major player in the industry. Everyone knows their name, their brand is slowly capturing market space in other sectors. A good article on this can be found online, search for ""Corsair gaming moving from player to contender""  

The stock was very much cyclical, +/- 20% ever couple weeks, with growing support and a bullish trend. Well, after a bottom the Nasdaq sell-off began and so did the $35 support of Corsair, crashing to the 20's for one day.

The financials of Corsair are amazing for a growth tech company. Seriously, find me one tech company that grew 70% YOY in revenue and is valued at a forward P/E of low 20's. Currently, they're trading at 2x revenue. That is insane, however, it's because their margins are lower as they don't manufacture most of their own products.

My favorite part of Corsair? They're buying up companies in which many are related to streaming and recurring revenue. Look at some of them:

Elgato (They are 100% focused on making products for content creators)  
SCUF (A streamer will want to showoff their custom controller and expect them to own more than just one)  
ORIGIN PC (Same as above. Showing off custom built products as a content creator)  
GAMER SENSEI (A coaching platform for gamers)  

Their Growth Strategy is as follows:
-Advance as the global leader in high-performance gaming and streaming gear.  
-Continue to develop innovative, market-leading gaming and streaming gear.  
-Expand into new gear and services that grow our market opportunity.  
-Leverage our software platforms to sell more gear to existing customers.  
-Strengthen relationships with end-users by increasing direct-to-consumer sales.  

Then there's the 3/22 lockup expiry. During a 3/12 investor conference the CEO Andy Paul (who I hope they replace, he's a tech nerd not a multi-billion dollar company CEO), stated there is nothing to worry about for the lockup expiry. They went with one investor who is not selling their shares. For the other 7 million+ shares they sold in January during a second public offering, they were purchased at $35! Do you think these investors will immediately start selling? If they do, it's two days of volume. It won't be an issue. Meanwhile, everyone is suggesting they'll buy AFTER lockup! By then, it will be too late. 

Finally, the short float is extremely high. Two things happen during lockup expiry. One, investors sell and the prices go down 10%-20%, and the shorts cover. Two, prices do not go down, shorts cover, shooting the price up 10%-20%.

This just in: They released a new keyboard and it's already sold out. Their products are on FIRE!

Bear Thesis:
-Gaming was a COVID play and will not grow in 2021.  
-Lockup Expiry 3/22 increases shares float.  
-Tech stocks are scary.  
-Low support levels as it crossed below MACD.  
-Earnings are low. They need to increase their margins.  

All of bear points are mute when Corsair continues to blow revenue expectations

TLDR: Corsair is a great long-term play. If you believe gaming to continue to grow and Corsair products to be great, it's a no-brainer. My EOY price target is $67"
03/16/2021,stocks,Why on earth would you want Andy Paul to leave? CEO/Founders tend to perform better - plus he seems really sound to me - is Elon not a tech nerd? He's done alright so far.
03/16/2021,stocks,"They are mainly a hardware company and their margins reflect that. While their current growth is huge, one has to wonder how much the pandemic aided the current hardware sales (Logitech Revenue increased similarly). 

Corsair seems to be in the more expensive market and I cannot see them overtaking Razer or Logitech anytime  soon."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the write-up. I agree with a lot of your thesis here but disagree on the lock-up. Eagletree Capital holds 67% of the stock and invested out of EagleTree Partners IV LP a 2016 vintage buyout fund. They raised an upsized fund V in 2020 which they're currently investing out of. Given fund IV is in year 5 and they have a clear winner here post-IPO it's only rational for them to capture the mark-to-market IRR exit their position and get their carry to focus on Fund V. They could distribute in kind but that's generally frowned upon by LP's. My guess is they sell into any strength in CRSR, which creates an overhang near-term. Will be a nice company post their exit though."
03/16/2021,stocks,I like how they picked up elgato and visuals by impulse. Really targeting the content creator / streamer crowd.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Build PCs, PC gamer, work in tech and keen for stocks. As someone who meets those four criteria, I don't get your $67 valuation. Only thing Corsair excels at is marketing and RGB IMO. I don't see the superiority others do, having had a whole load of their parts and a K70 right in front of me."

A crude way to value but I can see how they got there. 

CRSR is at 1.8 x TTM currently. 

A comparable player is Logitech at 4 xTTM. 

If CRSR was to match to the same TTM at 4x. 

That would work out to be around the $65/share. 

Not saying they are right or wrong but there is some justification behind the valuation.

  
If you perform a relatively basic DCF as well - you get a similar $65 figure:

2021-03-16 17:53:42,stocks,"US Cannabis is my highest conviction investment for the next 3-5 years (DD and analysis) **General Overview**

*  We are at a time where investor demand has been proven in the cannabis sector, yet the stocks for the leading US companies in the space are difficult to buy and undervalued compared to their hyped Canadian counterparts. These US companies have much stronger balance sheets, are growing faster, get much less media attention/hype and trade for far lower multiples than their Canadian counterparts. Given that the USA is currently the largest cannabis market, both in legal and illegal sales, and is poised to become the global leader in cannabis, I truly see no other investment opportunity quite like this currently available in the market for the average retail investor. I firmly believe that the US cannabis market is one of the best investment opportunities for the upcoming 3-5 years and potentially longer.

**The Market:**

* The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it’s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It’s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn’t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn’t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. 

* Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. 


**US Cannabis as an investor:**

* Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. 
 
* The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed “Multistate Operators” or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.

* Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. 


**Haven’t we already missed the boat?**

* You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. 

* It’s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. 


**Canada vs USA** 

* Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. 

* In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. 

* Compared against Canada’s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California’s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. 

* In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It’s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. 

* Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. 

* These states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.


* As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.



**Canada vs USA - The Numbers**

* Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:

* [Canadian LPs](https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0)

* [US MSOs](https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8)

* The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.



**Who are these US cannabis companies?**

I have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. 

**Curaleaf:** 

* Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.
* 2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.
* Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY
* Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA
* Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. 

**Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):**

* Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. 
* Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.
* They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.
* Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin


**The bear cases**

***It’s just a plant, can’t people just grow it at home?***

* Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren’t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It’s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. 

***What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?***

* Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.

* Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there’s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. 

* In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I’d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.

* I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. 



**Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:**

* Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.

* Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.
 
* The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:

* The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.

* The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill’s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. 

* There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. 

* Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. 

* Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. 



**My Strategy:**

* I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it’s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. 


* I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and headwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. 


**Discloser:**

*I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future. Cannabis is a volatile market with inherent risks, invest at your own discretion.*"

My town has 3 dispensaries and it will never have more than these 3 because local and state regulations literally makes it impossible. You will have to ignore the laws of physics to open more stores.

They might be able to pivot some of their production efforts from tobacco to weed easily. Many of us want it to be legalized and hope it will be but it's not guaranteed. They play it safe.
  
I am personally not going to invest in marijuana until it's legal. Plus the new companies in my mind will be at an advantage. They wont be taking on any debt or anything until it's a sure thing they can sell their product everywhere.  
  
Maybe investing in the precursors to marijuana cultivation would be a good idea right now. Investing in soil, nutrients, grow equipment like lights and hydroponics, REITSs which will likely take advantage of the new industry. Theres probably more I'm not considering.  
  
Let me know your thoughts about this"
03/16/2021,stocks,Legal weed will not work in America if they follow in the footsteps of Canada. The black market is still strong here as dispensaries charge ludicrous prices. I'm not going to pay $60 (CAD) for a gram of shatter when my plugs got it for $30 (CAD). I think the bear case for weed is obvious if you just use the Canadian market as a small scale preview of the United States. There are Canadian provinces losing money selling weed somehow.

The concern being that these enthusiast will grow mj and give away for free or for a small price to their friends.  As time goes on these enthusiast will grow amazing mj, better than the majority of OTC brands selling in stores.  And as they get better at growing potent mj they will start to be more aggressive with sales/prices.  They will soon figure out a more efficient way to increase their profit margin while also selling better product for cheaper prices than the dispensaries.

I see very few mj companies being profitable in the long run simply because of how much more sense(its sooooooo much cheaper) it makes to buy from an individual grower."

I do agree with you, and I felt that I addressed this point above in my post, maybe not clearly enough as it's come up several times in the comments. I have no doubt that after cannabis is legalized, there will be major acquisitions by the big retailers like big tobacco. I actually don't see any other way for these non-cannabis companies to compete in the space without major acquisitions. I see a lot of growth taking place in this industry even before federal legalization, and I see this as an investment opportunity for retail investors to get into these potential-to-be-acquired companies while they're relatively cheap compared to where they will be when cannabis is federally legal."
03/16/2021,stocks,The second it becomes legal federally in the US the big players will swoop in and immediately begin production and distribution. Trading weed stocks is pure speculation and has probably lost millions of retail traders money.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think very long-term the market will coalesce a bit and a lot of smaller brands will get acquired. Like you said, not a bad thing for shareholders.

I think the next few years will still be a competition among boutique brands and also low-cost distributors. I expect big tobacco will move in a bit late, but pay heavily to dominate the market. Federal legalization is probably coming later this year with another crop of states soon to follow, and the existing medical players and their dispensaries will see big short-term gains."

I would agree with this mindset if the MSOs were struggling financially, but the opposite seems to be happening. They are building market share, building up their infrastructure in each state that they operate in, and have strong balance sheets even relative to non-cannabis companies. 

> Maybe investing in the precursors to marijuana cultivation would be a good idea right now. Investing in soil, nutrients, grow equipment like lights and hydroponics, REITSs which will likely take advantage of the new industry. Theres probably more I'm not considering.

This is exactly why I'm taking the ETF approach. I do not want to pick specific companies to invest in, as I feel that the overall US cannabis market will grow multifold across all involved sectors and picking specific companies is unnecessary. The ETF I mentioned in my post actually holds a cannabis-focused REIT (IIPR) as a major holding and tries to get exposure across the different sectors of the US cannabis industry

Hope this helps"
03/16/2021,stocks,"The pot market will eclipse big tobacco if you ask me.  Once it becomes legalized capital will flow into these companies and big tobacco will be lucky to get a foothold. Plus there are already so many independent and specialized producers it will take years to crush or acquire. I expect weed to be the end of big tabacco. Stoners are also connoisseurs of strains, it's a different model than tobacco. Even cultivation is different due to the diversity of the plant. I think way down the road it might end up like big tobacco but it won't be the current big tobacco companies running the show it will be someone like curaleaf. Weed is a disrupter for big tobacco. Fear is time for greed, ask Buffet."
03/16/2021,stocks,"> Big tobacco will very likely invest once it is legal, not before

Wrong.  MO has I think a 45% stake in Cronos.  I bought MO because of that, and it's done well.  The 7% dividends are also really nice."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Your line of thinking would be spot on if it was 2017, all the side things like hydroponics fertilizer and all that have already gained as much share value as they can get, miracle grow was actually in a few weed ETFs when they were first introduced."
03/16/2021,stocks,You aren’t taking into account the millions of 35+ year old people that no longer have “plugs”. We just want to go into a store and buy it like a 6 pack of beer and move along.
03/16/2021,stocks,"From the legal states I’ve been to, that doesn’t seem to be a big issue. Some places will sell an eighth for like $20."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Was just about to write the same thing. The grey market here in Canada is stronger than ever now since legalization. I personally haven't even stepped foot in a licensed store because online dispensary prices and quality are miles ahead of what the government has produced. That's why all the Canadian operations are so overvalued compared to their sales. Although, I doubt the US will handle it in the same way as Canada."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Black market was definitely on top at the start of legalization but the legal market has definitely been catching up. Flower prices are pretty much even now especially with covid hitting the black market prices up. Cheapest flower is 3.57/g which works out to $100 ounces which is about even with black market bulk rn but still a bit higher than previous bulk prices. Concentrates are still a little ways away but I could see them eventually becoming even. OCS for example has shatter for $50/g and rosin for 65/g at cheapest. One thing tho is that there is a large concern for many smokers about the integrity and quality of black market concentrates. I know people who have had pine resin mixed into theirs obtained from ""reputable"" black/gray markets. This alone drives people to more legal avenues. Profit margins for concentrates is also crazy high, especially for companies who have outdoor grows. Even if you bought a 15% THC ounce for $100, that's 4.2 grams THC total for $100 and if you're selling that at only $30 you're making 26% profit. Considering legal avenues it's $50/g for shatter you're looking at profit = $210 - $100 - fees"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I absolutely agree, and feel like alot of people saying that black market weed is going go to out of style have no grip on the Canadian scenario. Black/grey market weed is rampant here, just not in the way you'd expect. These underground weed distributors work online, deliver weed to your doorstep in a week tops, have streamlined websites, and efficient review system and overall are almost as reliable as my local government dispensary. Speaking from experience, the quality of their product can be even better than legal weed. Not to mention that they're able to sell products (high strength edibles, concentrates, vapes etc.) that are straight up unavailable or banned depending on your province. All at rates that often rival if not defeat legal prices. Literally lookup some canadian mail order marijuana sites and subreddits to explore the depths.

&#x200B;

Theres also the huge age issue. Knowing the states, smoking age is gonna start at 21. You're gonna end up with a-lot of teenagers buying from these grey market sites with no real reason to switch once they come of age. This is almost exactly whats happening in Quebec since they raised the legal smoking age from 18 to 21.

Personally, despite all this Im very bullish on the future of weed in the US. Just not with Canadian distributors or the US weed companies that OP refers to. Tobacco companies have way more infrastructure, capital and resources to move into the weed market. The small players will be competing with these underground sellers, whereas the old players are probably gonna capture most of the casual market share. MO is already lobbying for legalization, is starting to buy up Canadian cannabis companies and have a couple of marijuana vaporizer patents."
03/16/2021,stocks,It's my understanding the black market is essentially dead in Colorado except for those growing it to sell out of state to its more conservative neighbors. Interestingly enough it's part of what is pushing some of those neighboring states to legalize it or at least decriminalize it. Medical is also the gateway to recreational because people then soon realize how ridiculous its illegality is.  Everyone ends up with a med license who wants it.
03/16/2021,stocks,"This dynamic will change quickly as weed becomes more socially accepted. Many cities are able to and have opted-out of cannabis retail so there are many places in Canada where consumers’ only access to the legal market is online. The second important variable, which I imagine will be very different in the US, is marketing and branding are very heavily restricted in Canada. This has definitely delayed adoption among new consumers. Cannabis stores look like strip clubs from the outside, it’s very intimidating for people who are thinking of buying for the first time."
03/16/2021,stocks,"3 years in and legal is about to surpass black market sales in canada. They're legal $99/ounces kicking black market ass in price. Illegall dispensaries have all but disappeared here in Vancouver. 

Legalization is becoming a success story here in Canada. We just need criminal supporters and boomers to die off."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I buy shatter for 10$. Stuff that tastes like fucking pineapple candy is only 30$. You can pay 75$ for the stuff that is almost clear or white, but that's just braging rights.

03/16/2021,stocks,$MJ is international.  $MSOS is USA only.  Best to have a mix of both.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I created a spreadsheet comparing financial information for the US MSO companies and Canadian LPs and took a screen capture. Please note that it is not exactly what is being held in the MSOS ETF that I describe in the post, but a list of the top companies in each space by market cap with a minimum of around CA$1B market cap. While there is a lot of overlap between my list and the MSOS holdings, a full list of holdings of the ETF can be found at the AdvisorShares MSOS web page.

03/16/2021,stocks,I post all my DDs on both /r/investing and /r/stocks. Feel free to look at my post history for proof of this.
03/16/2021,stocks,"And Philip Morris is a break off of Altria.

Imo big tobacco is gonna be the winner in the long term."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Fully agree. It's still early. The trick is finding which companies will succeed. 

Only spoke up because I've seen many posts on different boards saying that big tobacco won't have a chance of taking over the cannabis industry. Clearly I disagree.

I actually think now is a good time to buy big tobacco in anticipation of cannabis legalization. Altria is way down on their highs and although 2019 was a bad year 2020 was extremely profitable. They have a big dividend. So get paid to own it while we wait for the cannabis boom."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don’t know who the millions are, because I’ve done nothing but make money so far on them. Just don’t invest in Canadian companies and don’t buy at ATH and there’s money to be made.

Edit: Interesting that I’m getting downvoted. I guess there’s no money to be made on reputable US weed companies. Pack it up boys and girls, we’ve all done nothing except lose money."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Agreed. I think full federal legalization will ironically be the worst thing that ever happened to a lot of these marijuana companies. The Federal government outlawing it, and putting hefty banking restrictions on anyone selling Cannabis is keeping out many of the big players with lots of money.

Also I think people who compare Marijuana to cigarette companies are mistaken, I think alcohol is the better comparison."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Legalization is almost certain to come long after decriminalization. Most of the M&A is expected after legalization, so in the meantime US MSO's holding licenses have a long growth runway before they will face significant competition."

03/16/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't even call it penny. More ""just short of legit"""
03/16/2021,stocks,That's super bullish lol I'd absolutely love for it to hit those numbers but I'm not banking on it.
03/16/2021,stocks,This is a bit strange because MSOS is only 13% off from its ATH and it was only above its current price for about a month since inception. Unless you haven't been investing long or bought some risky options I don't see how it could be your worst performing investment?
03/16/2021,stocks,Cronos is a Canadian company. It is not yet possible for US-based non-cannabis companies to invest in the leading US cannabis companies.
03/16/2021,stocks,And the millions of people who have never partook but will rapidly or slowly take up the habit once it's a ubiquitous socially acceptable product that you can buy at a shop that looks like the Apple Store.
03/16/2021,stocks,"This is also a great point. For a lot of old stoners they would rather just get same day delivery or pop into a store quick while out and choose whatever strain they want. They aren't teenagers anymore so they don't care about an extra couple bucks per gram especially when you get that convienience, variety, and quality."
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm pretty sure we can all use mail order weed as a plug. shows up often within 48 hours on weekdays for me. wccannabis.co
03/16/2021,stocks,You can get a ounce of good outdoor bud for 100-150 before tax in California.
03/16/2021,stocks,That could become worse once federal legalization comes. Weed prices went up at Vancouver dispensaries after legalization because they could then only purchase from government licensed facilities. Vancouver had dispensaries prior to legalization as the city decided they would essentially decriminalize weed much prior to legalization in the country. I hope America doesn't fuck this up so we can fix the Canadian system looking south for inspiration but given how it was done here I dont have confidence.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I get downvoted to hell for saying the exact same thing.

There's a lot of non potheads on here thinking they know how/what the real hobbyist (ie people willing to spend $$$$$ on their hobbies) want.

Don't wanna say too much, but here in my state you couldn't even give it away. Nobody was buying retail because everyone was either growing their own or taking advantage of the local black market crash.

Loads of people got into growing. I was in the business of selling grow supplies. It was bank every day."
03/16/2021,stocks,Yes and my understanding is Colorado took a much more libertarian approach to weed than Canada so it depends on what the US federal government decides to do.
03/16/2021,stocks,Many people don't smoke much flower and prefer extracts which are 2x price at dispensaries and from my experience worse quality product but thats entirely anecdotal. Weed legalization is a failure here there is huge amounts of cronyism and a libertarian approach would be way better.

03/16/2021,stocks,"You are correct to presume this is a long hold. But I believe there are short term and long term gains for weed stocks. They follow the hype every time. It would be wise to keep track of them in general for any investor in my opinion.

03/16/2021,stocks,"So, buy altria?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I see arguments on both side of the table for this. On one hand, you have people who think big tobacco is going to come in and sweep up all of the major cannabis companies right after legalization. On the other hand, you have people who think the major US cannabis companies will become too large for buyouts at that point, and we'll see big tobacco get shut out.

I personally think the reality will be somewhere in the middle. I can definitely see some of the large US cannabis companies becoming so big by the time that federal legalization takes place that they would not be attractive acquisition targets, and will remain as standalone cannabis powerhouses, while the smaller companies get bought up. 

While I think MO is a good investment, I do not see it being a better investment right now than the leading US cannabis companies given that the tailwinds that I described in the OP will largely benefit the US cannabis companies above all others."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Well, Colorado is considered the model for the states that have legalized it although many went with higher taxes causing problems. Some have actually lowered them since. It sounds like the federal government is going to pretty much leave it up to the states and decriminalize it. Interstate commerce will be a game-changer. Especially for states like Colorado and California."

I see no reason why your beloved shatter prices wont follow suit in the near future.

03/16/2021,stocks,I think its the smartest play the cannabis fans refuse to look at.
03/16/2021,stocks,Those downvotes found support at -1 and are now back to their ATH of 4 with resistance at 5. I am entering a position now with 1 upvote at the current price. Do your own DD but I think OP's upvotes will be in the double digits soon.
03/16/2021,stocks,Lol did you start investing recently? If 9.55% is the most you’ve ever lost in an investment then you haven’t experienced real pain yet 😂
03/16/2021,stocks,Illegal weed is not safe and that is why the illicit market will die off eventually. We already saw the start with the recient vaping mess.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I read an article about why they were a good investment as they shift to a 'smokeless' future. They didn't mention any potential expansion into cannabis but we know better than that...

Edited to add: i just found a forbes article from a month ago how altria is becoming a cannabis company. Their stock took a hit, maybe I'll pick some up on discount to hold onto."
03/16/2021,stocks,Plus they’re in a pretty good dip already. Nows probably a good time to get in if Altria is expected to be a major player.
03/16/2021,stocks,"For real. I think I was lucky to be a stoner teenager in the years before all the synthetics. I had a colleague in the state lab tell me that they are being sent evidence that has all kinds of weird shit in it. 

I'll gladly pay a premium for a product that is safe and regulated."
03/16/2021,stocks,I don't think it's fair to say that all illegal weed is not safe because there are many illegal sources that maintain good practices. Depends where you are. There's different bubbles of supply chains with producers being big or small and all having their own ways of doing things. But that being said obviously regulation is going to be better for health and safety because you are guaranteed that peace of mind when purchasing from a regulated industry rather than having to rely on hard to find trustworthy/safe connections
03/16/2021,stocks,"Altria? Altria bought a huge portion of Juul a few years ago so that's probably the smokeless future. They also bought 45% of Cronos group.

Overall their revenue is still mostly from tobacco products and juul and cronos have cost them a lot of money (the bullshit association of flavored vapes and the hardening of lungs really hit them hard and Altria paid a lot of legal fees for Juul). But its clear they are diversifying. 3% of their revenue also comes from wineries they own now. 

Overall I like the stock"
03/16/2021,stocks,If its not regulated there is no guarentee as to safety. That's why states that have legalized it invest so much in testing and cultivation rules. Black market weed is risky. Why take the risk when you can go to legit dispo?
03/16/2021,stocks,"I just read that they bought into cronos. Previous article i read didn't mention that at all or I may have given up on it before getting to that part. Haha

I'm starting to like the stock"
03/16/2021,stocks,You're not wrong I just wanted to clarify that it's incorrect to say that all illegal weed will be unsafe to consume
03/16/2021,stocks,"There is a strong bear argument against it though.

They have a huge dividend and give 80% of their profit back to owners via dividend. Revenue is shrinking. 2019 they had a negative balance sheet (but this was the same year as all the juul media bullshit). 


So basically the bear argument is they give away too much profit to expand properly. I disagree with that becuase off the top of my head I think they have 6 billion in cash laying around. 

Bears also argue that the high dividend is to keep investors around so they ignore the shrinking revenue. But again I don't know how much that matters since their profit margins have been increasing while revenue shrinks. 

If they slashed their dividend to save money to buy out cannabis companies would investors all jump out? Or would they recognize that this is a good long term choice for expansion?

More to consider."
03/16/2021,stocks,I see your point. In a lot of states now its perfectly legal to grow your own too. A lot of people share those yields. You can even buy small plants and seeds legally in some places. That's all legit.
2021-03-16 17:41:10,stocks,"Does the end of IPO lockup period provide a buying opportunity? Due to the increase in supply that’s created after the lockup period, does this create a good buying opportunity for stocks that you are interested in? 

Does the increase in public float after the lockup period depend on the price of the stock. Example if the stock started IPO with a price of 50, but the stock price increased to 150 by the lockup period end date, does this mean a lot more insiders will sell? 

If you have resources to monitor such data, please share. Thank you."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes, this is why it's almost always better to wait 6-12 months before buying an IPO - especially if they rocket off the start."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I've looked into this and honestly haven't seen it make much of a difference. The reason is because as people sell and push the price lower, there are others with cash that end up buying up the shares so it just balances out."
03/16/2021,stocks,Thanks for the reply. I’ll try looking into price movements from recent IPOs after lockup period. Especially those IPOs with major movement from its IPO listing price.
03/16/2021,stocks,Pltr dipped massively. Unity dipped aswell big on partial lock up
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't think I would call PLTR dive in February a dip as such. Rather, PLTR hyped up their stock before lockout expiry, so insiders could cash in as much as possible. After this, the stock returned to normal."
2021-03-16 17:36:09,stocks,"Looking for some opinions I have ~10k in a ""high yield"" savings account but it's not earning much interest. I want to pull it out and invest in long term growth. Is it smart to put it all in VTI or SPY or should I diversify more?
Thanks in advance"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Here is a suggestion:


40% VTI


30% BRK-B


15% QQQ


15% QQQJ


And when you add money, always add to the one that went down the most."
03/16/2021,stocks,Diversification is always recommended

2021-03-16 17:19:03,stocks,"Best approach for yearly trading/investing I'm very new new to trading/investing and only thought about it since the whole meme stock drama.
I would say I've higher than average savings for my age group in my country and the bank is giving me basically nothing on interest so I am trying to make more than the bank give me by investing / risking very little. 

The bank give me £30 for my annual interest on my saving. 

I am currently only investing £90 total on various stocks. 

I wanted to gather some views on if it is better to sell my shares once I hit a certain increase percentage or just leave them there if I believe the stock should keep increasing?  

At the moment I'm up about £10 on my original investment which means I'm already 1/3 on the way to my minimum target for the year.  If I don't sell now its all unrecognised gains but If I sell I'll have to search for another stock I feel will increase by X percentage within less than a year. 

I guess the question boils down to take the profits while I can or fuck about and find out."
03/16/2021,stocks,"So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Many thanks Yazoodd for the write-up.

It seems simple enough but I have to ask, how much micro-managing do you have to perform?  you buyand sell based on the afortmentioned indicators, do you watch for them or have some form of notification via trading view (which i will have to aquate myself with)

I trade/invest on Freetrade (free account) which is buy & sell only, no SL or TP but the urge to constantly check the market is there so the fear I am missing out is always there since it's always in my face.

as mentioned I'm only investing £90 which is desposible income, I would blow it on some random crap if i didn't invest it but my goal is to out perform the banks interest on my main saving pot.   I could add funds but I want to keep it at a level where I can reasonably make more than £30 pa and don't mind too much if i loose it all.

Once I use my savings (house) then i may consider some more long term investments 5 year +.

I used Freetrade as it's free and i can purchase partial shares, working with small capital would limit me to pennystocks but i bought;

$CRSR

$AMC (meme i know but sitting at +35%)

£IUKP

$BA

$PLYA

$RKT

$HUYA

£AV

and for a while the majority were green but thats only 2 months.

certainly using additional tools such as tradingview rather than the colour of my investment gain/loss would most likely be a better indicator of what i should be doing."

2021-03-16 16:49:41,stocks,"Volkswagen (VOW.DE/VOW3.DE) short squeeze! up 20%/6% dod !? Who else is following the short squeeze going on in Volkswagen ([VOW.DE/VOW3.DE](https://VOW.DE/VOW3.DE))

I'm hearing a lot of chatter out there. Here's what I've picked up so far.....

I'm reading stories that range from the technical to the fundamental. 

\*\*The shorts playing Long-Porsche / Short-VOW are being forced to unwind fast! (Porsche trading at a discount to its 56% holding in VOW)

\*\*There is also chatter of memories of 2008 when funds got hurt badly shorting VOW, so are now in a scramble to get out. 

\*\*US retail buying the illiquid Volkswagen ADR (based on the Ord). Traded 3mln shares ($75mln) the last few nights in the US, compared to the adv of 200k. 

\*\*On the fundamental side, its been positive news from VW the last few days. Results well received and the Power Day yesterday showed a large scale commitment to the EV future. 

\*\*Analysts calling for continued multiples exapnsion as more EV/tect valuation is applied. 

Regardless....positioning is important as I've read that VOW only have 10% freefloat and 7% of that is out on borrow! If that's true this could be a wild ride!"
03/16/2021,stocks,"2008 called, they want their meme stocks back!"

welcome back indeed! lol"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Oops...didn’t mean to put a link in. Why sketchy? If it’s a lagger, “undervalued” and the shorts need to cover? I mean... if the rumors are true and 7% of 10% free float needs to be covered, it has to pop? Right?"

03/16/2021,stocks,"Honestly 100% could be true, but just the timing of the Gme squeeze/ how much they were compared and now this information gets out while its a battle over there with hedge funds, im definitely gonna keep an eye out for it though and hopefully more solid DD will come with it :)"
03/16/2021,stocks,Yes.  TD does not have those tickers mentioned. Are they the same thing?
03/16/2021,stocks,"I hear ya loud and clear. Could be the European retailers sticking it to the funds. I read Michael Burry bought Volkswagen betting it is going to beat Tesla in the EV race. Not 100% if that’s true. Anyways, worth keeping an eye on!"
03/16/2021,stocks,"If you mean same thing = same company, then yes. TD has the ADRs. So, not the actual euro denominated paper. Just dollar receipts. But should track the European stuff fairly closely."
03/16/2021,stocks,Great thanks.  Adding to watch list.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-16-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures mixed after Dow, S&P 500 closed at record highs again

> * U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 little changed after they both closed again at record highs to start the week. Nasdaq futures rose Tuesday, adding to Monday’s 1.1% gain, which moved the tech-heavy index to just 4.5% away from last month’s record high close.

> * Stocks were able to shake off the 10-year Treasury yield holding around 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, after hitting an over one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. Rapidly rising bond yields have recently been a drag on growth stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and compress market valuations.

*****

> # 2. Fed to begin March meeting with polices under scrutiny

> * The Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day March meeting Tuesday, will be watching bond yields and the latest reading on retail sales. Economists expect the government’s February data to show a 0.4% increase in retail sales following a 5.3% surge in January. With the Fed’s extraordinarily easy monetary measures during Covid under scrutiny, the nation’s central bank is set to release new economic and interest rate forecasts along with its policy statement Wednesday afternoon.

*****

> # 3. Moderna studies Covid vaccine in kids; more countries halt AstraZeneca

> * Moderna has started testing its Covid vaccine in children ranging in age from six months to less than 12 years old. The mid-to-late stage study intends to enroll about 6,750 kids in the U.S. and Canada. In a separate study, which began in December, Moderna is also testing its vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years old. The two-shot vaccine has already been authorized for emergency use in Americans 18 and older.

> * Sweden and Latvia on Tuesday joined a fast-growing list of European nations suspending use of AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine as health regulators proceed with a new review into its side effects after reports of blood clots. Germany, France, Italy and Spain on Monday said they would all stop administering it. However, the World Health Organization and Europe’s drug regulator have recommended that countries continue to use AstraZeneca’s two-shot regimen.

*****

> # 4. Regulators investigating ‘violent’ Tesla crash; Autopilot not ruled out yet

> * The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating what it calls “violent” crash involving a Tesla sedan and a tractor trailer last week in Detroit. Authorities have not yet said whether the electric car maker’s Autopilot, Full Self-Driving or FSD beta may have contributed to the accident. The NHTSA has previously embarked on probes into more than a dozen crashes that were thought to involve Tesla’s advanced driver assist systems.

*****

> # 5. OxyContin maker Purdue proposes $10 billion plan to exit bankruptcy

> * OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is proposing a $10 billion plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection. Those efforts would include a significant boost, more than $4 billion, from members of the Sackler family who own the Connecticut-based company. Court documents show Purdue officials continued to push to maintain sales of OxyContin even as it became clear the drug was being abused. Complicated litigation is playing out in courts across the country in efforts to hold the drug industry accountable for the nation’s opioid crisis.

2021-03-16 16:26:46,stocks,"Nokia is firing from 5 to 10k people so they can invest hundred millions into the company. The goal is to save up €600M in expenses. Right now, Nokia counts 90.000 employees around the world. Depending on the market developments, in 2 years time Nokia can cut 10k jobs.

The money will be used for mobile networks(5G)  and cloud services. 

[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/03/16/nokia-announces-plans-to-reset-its-cost-base-to-invest-in-future-capabilities/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/03/16/nokia-announces-plans-to-reset-its-cost-base-to-invest-in-future-capabilities/)"
03/16/2021,stocks,Wow I hope it’s 5 people and not 10k
03/16/2021,stocks,"I have a coworker who was with Nokia and worked in telecom for many years. His take is that this is part of a longer term strategy for Nokia to rid themselves of the unionized workforce from the Alcatel-Lucent acquisition years back which has not integrated well, organizationally.

Just one person's 2 cents."
03/16/2021,stocks,Not cheering up for firing people especially these days
03/16/2021,stocks,NOK is also currently voting on selling 550M shares to the market to create capital. Email went out to shareholders over the weekend.
03/16/2021,stocks,"this is one of the absurdities in modern society and th stock market overall. they fire up to 10k people and get cheered on doing this. 

all investors care about is numbers and profits. no ones gives a single F about the social ramifications, the morals and ethics behind it.   


even though I considered NOK something of a ""sleeper"" to watch for the next years, I won´t invest in them seeing something like this.   


they are - by some- already considered to be one of the market leaders in 5G tech. why the sudden urge to do something like this ? reeks of desperation. 

they get a big no from me."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm one of those employees, hope I'm not gonna loose my job y'all 😒"
03/16/2021,stocks,"well thats a broad range, maybe they fire only 5."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Firing people is always a sign that there's not much growth or they over-hired, meaning bad management.

Would steer clear long-term."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Not sure I understand all the doom and gloom here. Not only was this information already in their annual report but it was always to be expected. 

Pekka is doing what should’ve been done years ago once they acquired Alcatel Lucent. Former CEO Rajeev Suri refused to cut dead weight and invest in R&D. Now Pekka is doing that and everyone is concerned? 

Pekka already doubled their operating margin from last year even tho revenue was $2 billion less. They have free cash flow of $2-3 billion which they will announce 3/18 and 4/8 what they will use that for. 

Could be what Pekka meant by a challenging year, letting people go. But he is just cleaning up a mess. They announced deals with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft yesterday I expect more good things out of Pekka."
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm blown away that nokia employees 90k people. Didn't realize that Nokia was still around.
03/16/2021,stocks,There's something fundamentally wrong about Nokia
03/16/2021,stocks,It is never a good thing when people lose there jobs.
03/16/2021,stocks,"So I was hearing all about NOK on these subreddits and decided to take a look. Stagnant revenue and stagnant (and tiny) margins for years and years. Nokia certainly has upside in revenue when it comes to 5G, but they really need to work on their profitability for their stock to be worth anything. So good news in that regard."
03/16/2021,stocks,"90k employees Jesus 
Google has 135k employed and I figured they would be a LOT higher than Nokia"
03/16/2021,stocks,This has the smell of desperation. Bad sign of things to come.
03/16/2021,stocks,Consider me absolutely fucking floored that Nokia still even has 5k employees to fire. That's wild.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Companies - “Why don’t millennials have any company loyalty?”

Also companies - lays off 10-25% of workforce every couple of years despite record profits.....because shareholder value is the most important thing"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't really get this.  To me a company who is firing 1000s of employees is a company not doing well.  The spin that this is to invest millions into the company is weak to me.  A strong company would do gradual layoffs so it wouldn't make the news. Sound more like they needed to save money badly.  Whatever the reason, mass layoffs is not good news....."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Nokia is the ultimate 🦀 stock and this will not change that.

Only way to make $ from NOK is to sell options to the gullible."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If Reddit would have instead focused on a company that is thriving more in the 5G space like ERIC they would have been up over 100%, but instead they rode this stinker for the past year. Good ol’ value trap."
03/16/2021,stocks,Just bought $4 puts and $4.50 calls yesterday
03/16/2021,stocks,Fuck you nokia
03/16/2021,stocks,Sounds like a pos company!
03/16/2021,stocks,Nokia sucks dick
03/16/2021,stocks,"It's sad that people are losing their job. However, you guys are acting like the Fins don't have universal healthcare and an advanced welfare system for those in need."
03/16/2021,stocks,Well thats a no from me
03/16/2021,stocks,So Nokias do break.
03/16/2021,stocks,So many people are tilting at windmills over here. There is literally one genuine comment calling it good news and one sarcastic bullish comment yet everyone's bashing imaginary people celebrating.
03/16/2021,stocks,Imagine not doing this and losing the whole 90k staff 🤷‍♂️
03/16/2021,stocks,Bullish
03/16/2021,stocks,"Woah they have 90 employees and they could potentially fire 10k 

“Congratulations, you’ve got the job”
“Thank y—“
“You’re fired”"
03/16/2021,stocks,Companies don’t exist to employ.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Calm down guys. Layoffs are inevitable part of economical and technological progress. Yes it sucks for people who are laid off (although I think it's a state's responsibility to provide safety nets), but economy without layoffs would become inefficient and outdated in a long term."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Baffled by the idiotic comments here. 

A company needs to make changes ultimately for the benefit of the business overall, especially when they're in the midst of growing and adapting to various factors and demand.

FFS even your beloved Tesla did this, it probably helped get them to where they are today: https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-layoffs-cost-cutting/"
03/16/2021,stocks,"In the long run they will probably keep more people employed. If they can’t compete they will go under. If they go under everyone loses their job. People always forget that productivity is what betters society.

We could hire 100 people with spoons to dig a foundation or we could hire 1 backhoe

The other 99 spoon diggers now go on to be doctors, lawyers, homeless, care for their kids.

On balance though the world is still better even if their are some negative consequences"
03/16/2021,stocks,Usually when jobs get cut higher ups get bonuses   You can’t tell me they need the money to upgrade and can’t afford it without firing employees.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Welp, not supporting layoffs, especially now. This is a sign that they might not be doing so hot, among other things. Time to sell my 4 shares at a loss I suppose"
03/16/2021,stocks,That's why don't ever love the company you work at unless your the owner.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Usually when a company fires or ""restructures"" 10% of their workforce it's not because they are doing great.... but they would always try to spin it in the best possible way. Doesn't mean this is the case with Nokia, just saying"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yucky. Sweaty and desperate. Won’t be touching this pathetic, filthy company."
03/16/2021,stocks,It is never the correct people that get chopped..... you know the ones that cost 10 times more thN the guy that actually works.... the guy who created an empire that delivers nothing.... the person who talks a good project and does PowerPoint but can't tell you what the team is doing next week...
03/16/2021,stocks,This title gave me an aneurism
03/16/2021,stocks,"This is not apologism, just another perspective.

Nokia HAS to lay these people off. If they don't the company gets dissolved and hacked apart by the market and then everyone loses their ""nokia"" job and a lot more people will lose their job-jobs.

The cutthroat nature of vulture capitalism, hyper-competitive utility markets, and consumers always seeking the lower price means you are leading the pack or at risk of being eaten. And if you think the boardroom within Nokia is distant and uncaring, take a guess how much worse a board of PEs and bankruptcy lawyers are.

This is the lesser of two evils because the reality is Nokia can't afford to be nice."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Once again, the comments here show that most ppl dont have a clue how the whole mobile network work. The phones are just one part of the puzzle. 

Here is a simple example on what happens when you make a phone call:

Phones ""register"" to the nearest base station/antenna all the time (i.e. network knows where the user with a given phone number is, at least which antenna is closest to it). When you make a call to another number (even if the other phone is just inches away), the signal first has to travel to the nearest antenna, which forwards it to the core network. The core network will determine where the destination phone/user is located, and forwards it to the antenna where that user is currently registered at.  There are tons of devices, computers, server/cloud farms that are involved in making this happen.  

There are tens of thousands of pages of standards document specifying on how the communication between the different components is made (by an organisation called 3GPP, where any company that has anything to do with telecoms is a member), and behind these specifications, tens of thousands of patents.  

Look at this list from late 2019, for example, regarding 5G patents

[https://www.iplytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Who-Leads-the-5G-Patent-Race\_2019.pdf](https://www.iplytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Who-Leads-the-5G-Patent-Race_2019.pdf)

As you can see, Apple, which everyone seems to declare as the leaders in 5G, has only 52 granted patents related to 5G, while Nokia has almost 1700! To compare, after working for 12 years at Nokia and Ericsson, I am a co-author of more than 400 patents on 4G/5G (of which around 100 are already granted)  and I had some senior colleagues at Ericsson who have more than a 1000 patents filed (and of which 400+ granted) in 4G/5G. And these patents are not only what happens on the network side (Base stations, core network), but also on how/what the phone does  (how the data is encrypted, how the data is compressed, how the data is converted into radio signals, how to make sure data will not be lost due to poor radio by repetitions/retransmission,  how to ensure that there is a seamless hand over from one antenna to another antenna when the user moves while on a call or data session without any data loss or interruption, on how the phone connects to more than one antenna whenever possible to get as much data rate as possible, etc...)

Until recently, Apple was just using the technology that is developed by tens of thousands of researchers from all over the world in companies that most people probably have not even heard of or the likes of Nokia and Ericsson, who are not producing phones anymore and ppl think are not active anymore.  

PS: Apple is stepping up their game in telecom R&D, specially after buying the mobile chipset part of Intel a couple of years ago. So they can be major players in the 6G system that is going to be developed during this decade. But until now, Apple more or less waited for the technology to be developed by others, and implemented the technology once it has been certified by 3GPP, and paid licensing fees for the others to make use of the technology."
03/16/2021,stocks,"They barely have a chance of succeeding even with unfair restrictions imposed on Huawei.

Nokia mismanaged their phones to 5g, don't think they worth investing."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Never a great sign when companies are cutting down on the workforce unless they are selling some part of their business or discontinuing a certain product or service.

I understand puting the money to use but i have not seen Nokia say what departements or business segment are affected"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Why is everyone so disgusted by a company trying to survive? If they go bankrupt 90k people will lose their jobs, not 5-10k."
03/16/2021,stocks,Why is everyone getting so mad in the comments? Are you guys actually surprised that a company would do this?This is just how big business works. Accept that or stay mad
03/16/2021,stocks,This sounds rough but ultimately it is probably a good move for the company in order to grow. The silver lining is it will allow them to grow enough to a point where they can hire more than they need to let go. Here's to hoping those individuals land on their feet!
03/16/2021,stocks,"Bad for the 5K to 10K employees, but I think it will be good for the company and investors. Hopefully there will be some training help for old employees to find new jobs."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm curious. Everyone is saying ""wow they're assholes for cutting jobs"", but I wonder if you'd rather get fired (maybe with severance, I don't know) or work at a company that's steadily going down hill because it's set on a path that isn't working?

I mean I get it, I've been fired too, but I've also been in a situation where getting fired probably would have been the best thing for me at the time."
03/16/2021,stocks,I hate stories like this 😭😢 ive seen too many friends and family go through this
03/16/2021,stocks,That’s terrible 😞
03/16/2021,stocks,The negative effect (overall culture and team dynamics) will suffer for 18-24 months with this sort of cut. Any money they reinvest won’t overcome the cultural effect for at least that long (in terms of productivity / delivery).
03/16/2021,stocks,Good.. Trim the fat
03/16/2021,stocks,"I like how the NOK holders are trying to spin this as good news for the company. If you have to fire 10,000 employees to free up the cash to invest in what your company said it was doing, then that means the company isn't making enough money to sustain or begin its developments/goals."
03/16/2021,stocks,Smart move. That news that I thought would be bad made GE stock go up.
03/16/2021,stocks,yay /s
03/16/2021,stocks,"""invest hundreds of millions in the company""? That's some spin. Employees add profit, that's why they hire them. So if the employees stopped making them profit, the company's tanking."
03/16/2021,stocks,Probably overweight with lots of people riding the clock.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Interesting. I’m hearing of a lot of layoffs locally and nationally lately. 

My employer (software publisher and technical consultancy) has been performing very well and had a great 2020, but we still did structured layoffs and buyouts in 2021. Part of it was pruning “low performers”, some was discontinuing some products/services aka trimming the fat, another part was freeing up budget for new investment for acquisitions, but the biggest reason (I was told) was there is generally a very bearish forecast in business right now because of general market volatility. At least the c-levels seemed to think so. Our CEO has been in business for 30+ years and has been through their share of ups and downs and I suspect they would rather pump the brakes slightly than go over a cliff."
03/16/2021,stocks,I offloaded my NOK this morning. I am not sticking around to see what this means
03/16/2021,stocks,"European companies must be tired of being down for decades, volkswagen are laying off people as well, they want US level gains and competition is finally on."
03/16/2021,stocks,"After the news yesterday, this is good for the company but sad for the people"
03/16/2021,stocks,"people talk phylosophical but this is r/stocks no? firing employees is shitty yea but it helps the company resolves debt and get back on their feet, isn’t that a good thing? For all we know, these employees could be the ones who underperforming hard and this is just them cutting out the freeloaders. Firing itself isn’t bad, in the long run (theoretically) if companies are willing to fire the bad performers and hire good employees, it improves the society. Just remember if you make society way too complacent, any crisis turns into a depression,"
03/16/2021,stocks,That’s just the world of business
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m sorry but I was taught investing is for profit and supporting companies you believe in that would generate profit for yourself. 

You shouldn’t let emotions sway your investment decisions. It’s a dog eat dog world and when it comes to the market if you do not check your ego and your emotions you will get eaten up. 

I personally believe NOK is solid for the long.
I could care less if they fired half the company. I will evaluate this stock by its numbers. I have seen multiple companies cut employees and raise company value and production. Just depends where the money is transferred. 

I will hold and monitor this company for another 10 years. 

Good luck to you all and may your journey be fulfilling and profitable!"
03/16/2021,stocks,This is not good news for long term growth. Firing are usually done when cash-flow is tight or right after mergers to streamline operations. This doesn’t look good on their part.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Actually I’m not for this, it’s already tough times for a lot of people"
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah that's called layoffs. Not a good sign for the company
03/16/2021,stocks,Bullish
03/16/2021,stocks,"My moral guidance will always beat out my greed.
That's probably why I'll never make boatloads of money trading and that's fine. 
Back in the 90s, (i was in a very famous TV sho-) mom had a nice job at AT&T, until they outsourced everyone and slapped our ass right into a cycle of poverty. I'll never give them a penny for that.
I'm almost certain every successful public company has done grimey shit just for a stock price and yeah it be like that I know."
03/16/2021,stocks,"As much as people are against this I don't think morality works when trading stocks.

Using forex trading you can bet on a country's economic collapse, and it would be highly profitable. Ethical traders make much less money."
03/16/2021,stocks,And that’s the last time I’ll ever buy anything from Nokia.
03/16/2021,stocks,#SELL
03/16/2021,stocks,"If a company has to fire people to reinvest, that is a poorly run company. This should show everyone how badly they managed their cash flow and how much trouble they are in. How this could result in a stock bump is beyond me, but this is not good for Nokia."
03/16/2021,stocks,I will never touch this stock. I don't want their blood money.
03/16/2021,stocks,Lol if they have to choose between keeping employees and investing in their future ITS PROBABLY A BAD SIGN
03/16/2021,stocks,Lmao at the title of the news release “Nokia announces plans to reset its cost base to invest in future capabilities” translation: were firing a bunch of shmucks and delivering their pay to our investors
03/16/2021,stocks,"I sold my shares. It was not as much profits as I once dreamed, but firing people is not usually the first recourse. It might be a structural change that's for the better long term, so I'll wait and see."
03/16/2021,stocks,Any company that’s laying people off right now should have their stock tank...all stockers should sell..
03/16/2021,stocks,Not great news at all in my opinion. Human capital is always the most important part of a company.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Nokia is not growing.

This is cost control as they’re fucked and was beaten by Ericsson to the 5G-era. 

Shitty balance sheet LOADED with goodwill that needs to be written down = massive costs next 2-5 years."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Glad I’m not invested in Nokia. 

Fuck them.

Profits"
03/16/2021,stocks,Fuck everyone in this thread defending this. This type of shit is one of America’s biggest problems. Everything is for profits. We should not ok exploitation of American workers.
03/16/2021,stocks,This company is literally letting go of THOUSANDS of employees and you're celebrating it? Do you really think this is a good thing for the future of the company??
03/16/2021,stocks,Awesome news!! Let’s see the stock fly
03/16/2021,stocks,"This is, if true, bad news for the company and the stock price."
03/16/2021,stocks,As long as the future is bright those people can come back later I doubt Nokia pays a lot
03/16/2021,stocks,"You can spin it how you want, it's not a good sign they have to fire so many people."
03/16/2021,stocks,Not a good sign. A bullish sign is when companies are hiring.
03/16/2021,stocks,Lol a company firing all their employees is the opposite of a company I want to invest in
03/16/2021,stocks,"I was always taught the BEST investment you can make in your co. is the people!!!  Keep the employees happy and your co will grow, apparently not in Sweden"
03/16/2021,stocks,I am surprised there are still so many employees in nokia.
03/16/2021,stocks,There's something to be said about the landscape they're apart of. They're basically forced to prop their stocks up to avoid getting rekted by moonboy investors that don't care about the fundamentals of a company. If they don't they simply won't survive.
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm more amazed that Nokia have more than 10k employees. Not sure what they're all doing
03/16/2021,stocks,The problem is employees trust these companies to look after them. Number 1 mistake
03/16/2021,stocks,"From the human side, this absolutely fucking sucks.

From a business standpoint, based on my personal experiences I can't help but think most businesses could scale back probably 20% and not see any real negative impact. So many jobs I've had and my friends have had are pretty good pay and you could get by doing next to nothing for years if you really wanted to (and a lot of people do)."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm not investing in NOK the same way I'm not investing in DoorDash. You wanna be scumbags, be scumbags, but treat your employees like people ffs"
03/16/2021,stocks,kinda fishy
03/16/2021,stocks,I can't support this no matter how much profit it will yield

03/16/2021,stocks,As long as they’re supporting the building of that straight Nokia based smartphone app called Fivesquare. It’s like foursquare but for medical professionals who have HPV

03/16/2021,stocks,Yikes. Shorts are going to run with this information. Expect a big dip.
03/16/2021,stocks,Nokia has been chopping at their own infrastructure for years in an effort to become solvent.  Every year a new CEO takes the company in a new direction. Ericsson kicks their ass.
03/16/2021,stocks,Extremely bearish imo
03/16/2021,stocks,"I have no horse in this race, so just thinking aloud. A quick search shows average annual turnover for tech companies is about 13 percent. Ten thousand is 11 percent of Nokia's 90k employee base. Over two years, they could potentially reduce jobs by attrition  and few or no terminations."
03/16/2021,stocks,Just don’t dance.
03/16/2021,stocks,Nokia still exists?
03/16/2021,stocks,"How do you grow without people working on things lmaooo

Growth = increase in demand for your product which is served by your employees and upsold for a profit"
03/16/2021,stocks,Sad but true!
03/16/2021,stocks,Yuck.
03/16/2021,stocks,Investing in employees is investing in a company. Trimming the fat is literally the reason companies turn into garbage. We’ll see what happens.
03/16/2021,stocks,Sounds like the kind of company I do NOT want to invest in.
03/16/2021,stocks,Let WSB pump it up and then dilute the shares through a direct offering for millions of dollars. retain your employees
03/16/2021,stocks,"This is where i feel bad when investing. Another example is the company ""vale"". It's dam broke twice killing hundreds of people, animals and the whole habitat flooding everything. A real disgrace. Anyway the company is still in the market and you see an exponential growing value."
03/16/2021,stocks,Wow.  How much they paying these people to be saving $100 million 😂
03/16/2021,stocks,"You all know that Nokia has a very very bad reputation in Europe? 

For unfair patent negociations (Against Car and PC Manufacturers)
And a very long history of firing employees.

from an ethic point i could never invest in Nokia, they basicly tried to make every p.c more expensive for everybody of us and lay down employees every year 
We are at over 10000 people since 2019...."
03/16/2021,stocks,I’m more amazed that Nokia has 90k employees
03/16/2021,stocks,Happy for people to lose their livelihood? Anything for stonks I guess
03/16/2021,stocks,What a waste of human capital.
03/16/2021,stocks,That’s fucked up. And it’s kind of even more fucked up that investors see this as a good thing.
03/16/2021,stocks,I can’t support a company like this.
03/16/2021,stocks,Nokia needs to buy back their shares. Dilution is ridiculous
03/16/2021,stocks,Well.. I guess they'll do anything for a fifty cent up tick now
03/16/2021,stocks,Bad sign. Do not invest in Nokia unless you like losing money.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Makes sense, as things scale there should be less manpower needed"
03/16/2021,stocks,Just pump it above 5 so I can get out. Thanks! Lol
03/16/2021,stocks,This does not sound like good news
03/16/2021,stocks,I guess they should have stuck with tires.
03/16/2021,stocks,The real question here is when will those employees put their NOK phones up on Ebay.
03/16/2021,stocks,"From an investing standpoint, this tells me it's a no buy. 
Sweeping layoffs scream poor management. Whether it's due to loss of business, poor staffing decisions, or a capital holdings company saying they need to slash costs for a merger, it's poor management. 
It takes alot of work, oversight and employee buy in to run an organization of that size efficiently, and when I see a rolling staff reduction of this size I happily walk the other way."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Eliminating 10k peeps will free up 600M euros? 

I wish they would just say we sucked as a management team and have to write down 600M in mistakes and our stupidity is going to cost 10k people their jobs. But don't worry this time we will reinvest ourselves and everything will be ok. 

During this ""restructure"" how about we reprice those stock options at 56 ATH."
03/16/2021,stocks,"How about we just don't invest in shady practices like this? The retail trader is likely the person directly impacted by behavior like this in their own work place. Its a horrible feeling knowing your hard work is being ignored or you're even being fired to arbitrarily pump up stock prices. 

There's money to be had elsewhere that can be obtained in humane ways."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Does this hurt or help them? On one hand this is disgusting behavior. But on the other, money."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Some ridiculous spin here. It’s a bad sign that they’re firing thousands of people, not a good one. Shows that management is amoral and greedy."

03/16/2021,stocks,Isn't Nokia a Finnish company? I thought there were strict labor laws that prevented stuff like this?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Well, that’s sad news."

03/16/2021,stocks,Wow bet none of those being fired are guys from the top pretty shirty business if you ask me
03/16/2021,stocks,:(
03/16/2021,stocks,"They also just announced partnerships with Amazon, Google and Microsoft on 5G and cloud solutions. Why is their stock still under $5?!"

03/16/2021,stocks,Sell sell sell!
03/16/2021,stocks,">Espoo, Finland – Nokia’s business groups today announce plans to reset their cost bases and invest in R&D and future capabilities including 5G, cloud and digital infrastructure, as well as other areas that will benefit Nokia in the long-term.

I'm excited to hear about Nokia's modernization and continued resilience. It's a crowded and competitive market, and if they don't adapt, they'll die.

I'm sorry for anyone losing their jobs. It's a savage world.

>Planned restructuring is expected to result in an 80 000–85 000 employee organization, over an 18–24-month period, instead of the approximately 90 000 employees Nokia has today.

If they go under entirely, then 90k people across over 100 countries will lose their jobs instead of 5k to 10k. Automation is also accelerating job loss everywhere by providing better margins. A good company will use that opportunity to improve itself as best it can. A bad one will solely enrich it's corporate board and/or shareholders.

>“Decisions that may have a potential impact on our employees are never taken lightly. Ensuring we have the right setup and capabilities is a necessary step to deliver sustainable long-term performance. My priority is to ensure that everyone impacted is supported through this process,” said Lundmark.

Time will tell. I hope this is true, but I'll be watching closely."
03/16/2021,stocks,So what does this mean for the stock?
03/16/2021,stocks,"The wife’s eyes rolled so hard when I told her I bought more NOK that you would think she was possessed.

Edit: I do hate to see people lose their jobs. I trade very small time just to pay an extra bill or fun stuff so I could definitely understand what those folks will go through."
03/16/2021,stocks,Fuck Nokia for doing this.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Classic new CEO, age old approach of covering their ass and making numbers look better than they are by firing people to ""save costs"". Classic late stage capitalism. Barf.  


CEO Pekka Lundmark has a net worth of 6billion. He could personally pay each HUMAN BEING he's going to lay off 25k to ensure they will be ok, and that would be only 2-4% of his net worth. Obviously that won't happen. Barf.   


If ever I see a new CEO come into a company I work for, I'm already sending out resumes and lining up offers, just in case."
03/16/2021,stocks,I lost hope as an investor in NOK at their last earnings
03/16/2021,stocks,Holy 💩
03/16/2021,stocks,This is not a company to invest in. The float is insane
03/16/2021,stocks,"Capitalism, gotta fire a few thousand people so our stock price can increase a few dollars. Oh whats that, you want a raise for more work you have to do? Sorry, work harder or you will get written up."
03/16/2021,stocks,Fuck you Nokia
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah that's not a positive. No matter the ""reasoning"" the PR department throws in your face to distract you."
03/16/2021,stocks,"When companies start sacking people to invest money, you know they've either made huge mistakes in the past and the ones responsible are not amongst the people getting fired, are making a huge mistake right now firing a large part of their most talented personnel, or both. Get out while you still can."
03/16/2021,stocks,I think it’s fucking disgusting that anyone on here is cheering this news.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Well, looks like a good reason to sell. Not okay to fire people just to cut costs 🙄"
03/16/2021,stocks,90k work at Nokia and look at the products they produce?  Way too many to produce crap. They should fire all them and start over
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think this is good for everyone involved. Nokia raises it's wages for those who remain, those who were stuck in dead-end jobs at Nokia get a new lease on life, and Nokia as a company becomes actually worth something despite being always ""potentially"" worth something."
03/16/2021,stocks,fuck them if they fire people
03/16/2021,stocks,This is a bad sign.  The company can't be profitable enough as is so they're pulling this desperate move.  Don't expect them to be profitable afterwards either.
03/16/2021,stocks,You're gonna be holding bags.
03/16/2021,stocks,I hope it doesn't help and the company goes bankrupt. Firing 10k isn't a good look.
03/16/2021,stocks,Nokia is a scam company. They have no future tech and they previously were caught lieing to SEC. Run away from this scam
03/16/2021,stocks,Nokia is the biggest liars out there. They were fined lying about having an electric motor tech to rival tesla by the SEC. Now they are making up hope that they will discover (5g tower) tech...RUNAWAY from NoKia its a scam!!
03/16/2021,stocks,Bad company that’s fired ppl
03/16/2021,stocks,Great I hate it.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Their balance sheet is pretty bad and getting worse, cash flow going down, losing 5G race, they have to do it to survive. It sucks, but it makes sense."
03/16/2021,stocks,sold my shares of NOK. Don't like the fact they're treating their employees like nothing but numbers
03/16/2021,stocks,"I feel like objectively this is news that'd make you consider investing in the stock. 

Realistically that makes me never want to give them a penny"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Trash company, and now they're firing people..."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Glad I bailed on Nokia weeks ago cause on top of being a shitty move ethically it doesn't speak well for their business if they're liquidating parts of the company, including the actual employees, to give the impression of growth."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Honestly, why would You wanna invest in a company that provides no job stability for their employees? To me that actually screams ‘don’t invest.’ Because that tells you everything about their Performance"
03/16/2021,stocks,"NOK is a company based in **Finland**...which just fired **10,000 people**.  

Negative earnings and growth...what is the attraction with this stock?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"What the fuck, I’m out for Nokia. I cannot stand by this, sorry for all those people who are getting fired."
03/16/2021,stocks,"All that for one of their 50 cent upticks isn't worth it

Down vote all you want but the most exciting thing Nokia done in 5-10 years is that NASA contract this Amazon is more fluff than MS smart phones


And they want to let people go shame on them and you if you think you're gonna net profit off this"
03/16/2021,stocks,Why would you need that if you already have a poop knife?
03/16/2021,stocks,Time to profit off people getting laid off!! 💎🙌
03/16/2021,stocks,We do not like the stock
03/16/2021,stocks,LOL nokia
03/16/2021,stocks,It has been years since I’ve last seen someone holding a Nokia. What have they been doing to make money?
03/16/2021,stocks,Nokia is garbage.
03/16/2021,stocks,I wish it was 0. People dump their lives into working for these companies and get treated like they are no different than the worthless garbage
03/16/2021,stocks,I love how nobody replying to your comment realized it was a joke
03/16/2021,stocks,That’s a wide spread.
03/16/2021,stocks,r/notkenM
03/16/2021,stocks,"Firing 5 execs will do the trick, with the least amount of impact on the company"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Typically if you fire 10,000 people the rest have to do 50% more work or be afraid of getting canned, so half of them quit too. If the say they are going to fire 10k, they are going to fire 5,000. The rest they won’t have to pay unemployment to."
03/16/2021,stocks,"> 600M 

5 people could save €600M? So people from the executive leadership team. lol

It might be a good idea to fire the leadership team and start again."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Am I the only dumbass who thought they actually meant firing 5 people, rather than 5k as the lower limit at first. It took me a solid hour and I had to go back and read it again"
03/16/2021,stocks,I hope its 0 people and they go bankrupt.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm thinking that OP meant 5k to 10k, unfortunately."
03/16/2021,stocks,This. This is what I love about this sub. A good dose of humanity. Our society would be fucked in the long-run if we lose this (and with it would go our markets eventually).
03/16/2021,stocks,I'd never cheer for that. I've been around only a few that lost their job or told that they'll be gone in few months. It's horrifying.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah man. I was laid off from Hewlett-Packard back in 2009. It really sucks to lose a career especially with kids and a mortgage. 

There is a human impact here underneath the numbers. I can't ever celebrate a company doing this, even if it pumps the stock."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Also, Imagine the stress within the workers of the company. Although, if its saving or helping the company in the long term, that's important too."
03/16/2021,stocks,Me neither. I wonder if they are telling the full story.
03/16/2021,stocks,This is why Wall Street turns people into assholes. We shouldn't be cheering on other working class people losing their jobs.
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah this hella makes me sad. I own nok but.... Man...
03/16/2021,stocks,"This is just the way big companies operate. It’s not just for the sake of investors. Got many divisions spread out over decades and geographical regions? Sometimes you have to cut the under-performers, or risk the whole company going under. How do you pivot entire departments that build or support something that is no longer needed? Nokia and others like it are not really one company, they are conglomerates of various smaller companies. It sucks for the employees, but it’s more like their company went bankrupt than Big Evil Co marginalized them for shareholder profit."
03/16/2021,stocks,They took away 5k-10k families' livelihoods to print more money on an imaginary social construct stock market. Fuck the stock market and fuck Nokia. Disclaimer: I have a retirement savings account and I'm fully aware of the irony
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah. It's not a sign that a company is doing well either. It's not a sign of more investment in expansion. It's a sign they are struggling to pay their employees.
03/16/2021,stocks,Welcome to business. Stop investing and start donating your paycheck if you want to pretend to care.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Are they firing people, or just not backfilling when people leave?  That press release didn't really make that clear to me."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yea me either... but, i got a long call option i bought..."
03/16/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/16/2021,stocks,Thats like $2milion...
03/16/2021,stocks,"So in terms of their stock price it might be a wash. Up due to them cannibalizing labor, and down due to watering down their own stock?"
03/16/2021,stocks,To me plus the 10k mass layoff this reads as Nokia barely holding on.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm totally with ya. I like how Volkswagen handles their situation. EV's take less people in total to be produced so they need to let some people go. Instead of firing people they give those ones that are close to retiring a special contract they can sign if they want to so they can work half-time until they retire. The average VW worker in Salzgitter (which is the engine manufacturing plant of VW) is like 50 years old, so it's not hard for them to let some people go in the next time. Way better than just straight up letting people go and gives me hope in the company"
03/16/2021,stocks,Man. There was a time when I would read this as bad news? Am I that jaded?
03/16/2021,stocks,"If every company that did mass layoffs got blacklisted by you, then there would be no worthwhile companies left to invest in. This is a normal part of growth. Especially in an industry where things change constantly. I don't think anybody reads a headline like this and thinks ""yeah screw those people who lost their jobs"", instead they think about the investment and where the money is moving. 

I think it's possible to be both compassionate and smart with your money. I love dogs but you don't see me bringing every dog home from the shelter."
03/16/2021,stocks,"So you believe that businesses should never get rid of employees???  If they are trying to reorganize into a certain aspect of their business isn't it their duty to eliminate those who won't be doing functional work for the company anymore, or by your sentiment they should just continue to pay people to do nothing of value to the company."
03/16/2021,stocks,"you're blaming Nokia for operating as a business. remember, they are a for-profit business, not a charity.

if you don't like the idea of people being laid off, then your gripe is with the whole economy/employment system itself, no point blaming one specific company for doing it."
03/16/2021,stocks,this.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I watched one of my old jobs get scooped up by vulture capitalists, stripped of all its assets, and thousands of people get laid off. Management had the gall to send out an email celebrating record profits for one quarter just a couple weeks after laying off the entire sales department at my building. I watched those people clean out their desks and these asswipes were celebrating profits. Fuck Nokia."
03/16/2021,stocks,Well it depends. If you can fire 10k people and not lose revenue or increase costs clearly you fired the correct people. Every company has tons of dead weight. If you can find them and get rid of them it's fantastic.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Do your research on nokia lying to investors and receiving fines from SEC . this isn't a sleeper , it's a scam. Run away"
03/16/2021,stocks,welcome to capitalism dude
03/16/2021,stocks,"Imagine being an investor and NOT caring about numbers and profits. You want to be some goodie two shoes then this might be the wrong thing for you.

By the way you don’t have any kind of moral high ground investing in companies like PLTR and GME."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes, it will be impossible for the Nokia employees to find a job after getting terminated. They are just menial laborers who have no education! 

/s"
03/16/2021,stocks,I stand with you. Back with ccl fired a bunch of people I also refused to invest in them also.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Agreed, I don't like the stock"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Let me just start with this so you know where I am coming from. I'm a full-on Marxist.  The stock market to me is an aberration.  I find the entire idea that workers work and investors earn to be morally reprehensible.  I also think that profit in firms that are not employee owned is a form of theft.

I would imagine that you and most other people in this sub fully disagree with me on all of that. That's fine.  I'm not here for a debate on capitalism v socialism. But...

The world is the way it is.  What Nokia is doing *is* capitalism.  People that think like I do are exceedingly rare in the US.  We are not represented by a single individual anywhere in congress.  We can't fight against this without a massive education campaign and organizing and a bunch of time.  I certainly cannot.

I have a wife and a daughter that I support fully.  I can't wait for America to become socialist before I start playing the best hand I can play.  Just because I disagree with the way the world works doesn't mean I should bury my head and deliver a suboptimal experience for them.  If it were a zombie apocalypse, should I just give up and walk naked into a hoard because it sucks?  No.  You do everything you can for your family and their future regardless of how you feel about reality.

If NOK is going to fire a shitload of people to make more money, that's what most companies have done at some point.  GM, Ford, Ameriprise, Wells Fargo, ExxonMobil, you name it.  They've all done it.  It's bullshit and it ruins lives, but this is the system everyone stans for.  Even participating at all in our system is an affront to my personal morality.  I might as well buy stocks and make money so I can earn the freedom to peacefully exit the system as soon as possible.  If that means profiting on NOK, it's par for the course."
03/16/2021,stocks,"it is not an absurdity. We found out what we know, mostly through trial and error.

from a business perspective, it is amoral to hire more people than you as a company can utilize. 

Manpower is a resource, just like energy. If you are employing more workers for the same tasks as your competitor, you are inefficient, wasteful. 

Employing people is thankfully not the purpose of a capitalist company.

The GDR had a system like you seem to favor, in which companies had the social obligation to hire a certain quota of workers, regardless of their needs, worked out great for everybody involved."
03/16/2021,stocks,"And even leaving aside the morality stuff, this would give me only distrust. Their good people will look forward to go a safer place and they'd have problems to bring good replacements. The people that stays also will have more job to do in a worse working ambient. Also it brings to light the limitations of the company that their way of having more money is only firing people"
03/16/2021,stocks,This isn't really a modern  problem imo and nothing particularly absurd about it.  When was there ever a time when ethics mattered to the heads of the largest companies. Arguably we are in our most ethical time for that unfortunately.
03/16/2021,stocks,A businesses only incentive is to make money. That’s the system we created. Human centered capitalism is needed for the future
03/16/2021,stocks,I disagree. Sometimes you have to make difficult decisions for the benefit of the company and therefore also the benefit of all the other workers that keep their jobs. Nobody wants to fire 5000 people but some things need to be done. You can also think about all the 401ks that could benefit from this which otherwise could be impacted negatively. It doesn’t always have to be greed. Although it is impossible to know the true reason.
03/16/2021,stocks,As investor in a growth companies I never want to see firings or layoffs. Nothing screams desperation or financial troubles like layoffs.
03/16/2021,stocks,They are losing market share every year.
03/16/2021,stocks,Not here to make jobs. Here to make money.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Also, implementing new technology requires MORE skilled labor. Updating cell networks is ALOT of work. It is odd they claim to be investing in that kind of expansion while downsizing the company."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I was thinking the same thing. Firing 10k is *not* a good sign. It means their ambitions are getting smaller, or something is going very wrong"
03/16/2021,stocks,It is one of the most depressing things about stock market to be honest
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah seriously wtf. This is right up there with people excited about the extremely shady Palantir stock doing well. Let that shit burn please. If only redditors would gas up stocks that have the potential to genuinely make the world a better place.
03/16/2021,stocks,Thank you for being a decent human. I can't intentionally profit from even one person losing their job.
03/16/2021,stocks,"> all investors care about is numbers and profits. no ones gives a single F about the social ramifications, the morals and ethics behind it.

Not all investors.

I personally dont ivest in FB, and dont plan on buying RH when it IPOs either. I also dont invest in private prisons, and try to stay away from military stocks (except if they have space exploration tech)

ESG (Environmental, social and corporate governance) is becoming increasingly popular."
03/16/2021,stocks,"how so? i understand and partially agree with what you’re saying, but if these people are in a position where they’re not adding value doesn’t it make sense? personally, i would always want to be in a position where my work is needed."
03/16/2021,stocks,So they should just actively not make their company better and more profitable ?
03/16/2021,stocks,Capitalism be like that some time
03/16/2021,stocks,Unfortunately this is Nokia's go-to move for the past 50 years. They are notorious for massive lay-offs and screwing people over.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Not sure if u were trying to be funny, but think OP mean 5K to 10K. I.e. 5 to 10 thousand"
03/16/2021,stocks,Its worth noting that they had a huge (in terms of employee counts of both entities) merger with Alcatel-Lucent in 2016. And ALU itself was formed as a result of a big merge 10 years prior to that.

03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't know of that's completely fair. I mean markets change, and firms can't always predict what the future holds. All blue-chip companies have annual layoffs, due to various reasons, but they are usually safe long-term investments.

I'd even argue that companies that don't do significant overhauls regularly are not addressing the constantly changing market, and that actually demonstrates bad management. This is not to say that firing people is good,  but more the world changes and companies/ideas need to change as well."

03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't hold NOK and I don't love the company, but I don't agree that it's always a sign of bad management. Nokia clearly dropped the ball in the past and were complacent against emerging competitors. They are going through a pretty substantial transformation, not the first in their history. Their corporate leadership is brand new, so it's not fair to judge their management of the company based on hiring decisions on the past (from when the company still had a different strategy).

I have worked with companies similar to Nokia before: Old, big corporate battleships going through a tough transformation and modernization process. Every department had staff that had no purpose or role in the direction the company was headed, and a lot of them didn't want things to change, which is understandable on a human level, but not conducive to a successful company in the future. In some cases this resistance to change meant undermining management.

Should these companies try to keep people like this around, and risk the survival of the company and the jobs of other employees? I don't think so. In the case of Nokia, the layoffs are projected over the next years, so I don't think it'll be done in a cutthroat manner."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Not necessarily.  Firing is also an attempt to raise stock price because ""trimming the fat"" makes a good headline.  NOK at $4 could be the reason."

Suri was a do nothing CEO for six years. And his predecessor Elop was a trojan horse CEO - sell the mobile division to Microsoft to give them a faster dev time to market. Which failed anyway.  
Basically you have to look at Nokia as having lost a decade plus. In the public view people still think of it as a phone company.   
What people are missing is the network side of the business which makes them 1 out of 3 manufacturers.  
The other thing to consider is Nokia's transportation division. They do IOT stuff for aviation, highways, railways and maritime. USA will be doing 2-4 trillion in infrastructure. That high speed rail system Biden supports? They're going to need the stuff Nokia provides. Government Broadband? That's Nokia's Public Sector division. So there's a lot of other things besides 5G that will boost Nokia. It's just suffered from bad management for a long time. Unfortunately this means Pekka has to play the bad guy in laying off workers."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Sometimes. I don't want to defend big corporations as much the next guy, but some actually do treat employees quite well. I understand losing your job is pretty rough (I've never been let go, but losing a source of income hits real hard), but you also have to consider what a lot of employees actually bring to the table.

The answer is not a lot. Think Kevin from The Office. A lot of companies are able to let go large amounts of employees while maintaining high production. Why? Because they didn't need them in the first place. I'd say other companies just wait until people quit, retire, or get fired for another reason instead of fighting unions.

They should not have hired those people in the first place. Micheal never fired Kevin because he liked keeping him around. Dwight comes into the manager's position and fires him immediately. No one could even defend Kevin based on his merit. That's what a lot of companies are doing, they cut costs by looking at who's costing them money.

It sucks to lose your job, but that's why we empathize when we here about massive job losses. But you also have to play devils advocate and wonder why a lot of those people have been chosen to lose those jobs over the others. 

My point is, each case isn't a cut and dry ""that company sucks for firing a bunch of people"". There are a lot of variables to consider as to who is losing what jobs and why."

03/16/2021,stocks,Don't confuse the US with the rest of the world.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Eh, why? Most of these people are dead weight. Some actually good people will be lost, and some value too, but mostly it's just cutting off the extra fat. Many of these people are just lifers cruising to retirement and provide zero value. It's about time someone shook them a little bit. And I absolutely mean it's good for them too. People need to keep moving. It's truly sad when people get too attached and comfortable to a single job. You should be switching your jobs every 2-5 years anyway and explore, unless you have a very clear path from worker to C-level figured out and you're a fucking career rocket.

Good move, Nokia.

edit: also you're a dumbo if you dump your life into a company. You need to figure out your own value and needs. If you're capable, by all means dedicate all your energy and become a millionaire. If not, figure out a pace that's enough to keep you engaged and employed, but not too much to drain you because probably you'll never make it past middle management no matter your efforts."

03/16/2021,stocks,"See, I had the same reaction as you at first, like, ""This is a business so, I mean, while nobody is cheering for layoffs businesses are gonna do what businesses are gonna do""

but here's the thing.

Mass layoffs are like voluntary (or mandatory) overtime. If you require your employees to work X numbers of overtime every week, and they fulfill it every week, that's not a triumph. That's a symptom that your business is not being run efficiently. You are understaffed and your workers are overworked. Requiring overtime all the time is not a solution it's a band-aid.

In that same vein, I view massive layoffs like this as a band-aid and a sign of bad management. A company that screwed up so much they had to lay off a large number of people in order to ""correct"" it. It's a sign that the company has a lot of mismanagement and if they're laying off a mass amount of employees at the bottom to ""correct"" it, but they're not laying off any of the management at the top that allowed it to get there in the first place, then there's not much hope it'll change things in the long run. It'll merely be a band-aid.

In that case, it's still perfectly OK to say that you don't want to invest in a company for restructuring like this not just for moral/ethical reasons, but for practical/financial reasons."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It's not even that though. If you need to cut 11% of your employees to make room to invest in more infrastructure, then that's bad management. They either had a lot of redundancies, which is bad management, or they couldn't find the capital to invest so they just dipped to their operating cost, which is bad management. Either way, I see it as nothing more than bad management."

03/16/2021,stocks,Lmfaoo you good you should leave it lol
03/16/2021,stocks,The problem is often not in laying them off.  It is often in hiring them in the first place.  Lots of companies expand employees too quickly during the good times.  Little fiefdoms in company engage in empire building.  Every manager wants more subordinates so it increases the importance of the manager and calls for an increased salary.  Eventually the company finds itself in a situation that for survival's sake it needs to shrink the headcount.  It is a cycle that should be resisted but it is difficult.
03/16/2021,stocks,Which is why you should never have loyalty towards any company. If you get a better job and have to do them dirty then go for it 🤷‍♂️
03/16/2021,stocks,"My husband just lost his job. He never had any complaints against him, no write ups, no ""talking to""s, his coworkers liked him, his bosses liked him. 

But a new manager came in and decided to make himself look good buy cutting costs (my husbands salary). It was such a quick move that everyone was blindsided. He was still on the schedule (given out in advance) for over a week *after* he was fired.

They don't care about people, productivity, or work ethic. They care about numbers. The fastest way to cut expenses is to cut workers."
03/16/2021,stocks,"And these jobs are irreversibly gone, too. They're going to hire 200 5G network engineers (combined salary like $30M) in place of these 1k clerks (combined salary also $30M)"

03/16/2021,stocks,As opposed to what? The company going under and all employees losing their jobs? It sucks but the first rule of business is to actually stay in business.
03/16/2021,stocks,Yet they still employ 80k people after that. Or should they just give a job to anyone who asks for one even if they don't actually do anything and then keep paying them for the rest of their life?

Kinda feel bad for those getting laid off, but when you work in tech, you always need to be improving your skill-set to avoid being the one cut. This is common practice.

It will be good for the stock price to lose lots of complacent workers who specialize in old tech, and get new cheaper employees in to get the next gen tech rolled out."

That is the worst part IMO. Now you're over worked AND stressed. there is WAY too much support (financially) for people at the top and not enough for the average workers trying to get by. it seems very obvious that a rebalancing is in order but I'm not sure if or when that will happen."
03/16/2021,stocks,"At my previous company I went through multiple downsizes.

Each time my job was safe and ultimately I figured I had ultimate job security as no one could do what I did. But all the layoffs and the hemming and hawing (as well as CEO revolving door high fives) ultimately ruined any joy I had so I went job hunting.The week after I handed in my resignation to go somewhere else my department was told all our jobs were going to be relocated. So everyone in the room was going to lose their jobs in  2-6 months time.Really felt like I dodged a bullet there. The hardest time in my life to keep a straight face as I was celebrating my fantastic timing in my head as everyone else lost their jobs. :(

Moral of the story, you're never safe.

The company is bankrupt now btw. So the other moral is when the CEO revolving door high fives start, it's time to leave."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It is way worse if the company does a series of layoffs over a few years.  The general rule is cut once, cut deep.  If if gets drawn out then there will be a period of a month or two when there are rumors of a RIF, so productivity goes to hell and a lot of your good people start looking for other opportunities, many leaving before the RIF.  The RIF happens and everyone is shell shocked.  It may take a couple months to settle down.   People have to learn the in and outs of jobs that were being done by people who are gone, so their own job suffers.  Again productivity goes to hell.  With colleagues who have become friends gone, there is less tying the workers left to the company so more people leave on their own accord.  Do this a few times over a few years and it is like being a soldier in the trenches of WW1.  The quality of the employees goes down because everyone with balls has been RIFed or left when they saw the writing on the wall.  The people remaining are those who cannot get a job somewhere else or are too timid to try until forced to.

Overall it is a really shitty situation, not just for the employees but also for the managers who have to select who goes while knowing their family situations.  Managers leave because they emotionally cannot deal with cutting subordinates."
03/16/2021,stocks,"What happens when you ask for their entire salary to do their duties and negotiate from there? They can't fire you, being overloaded even with you there, can they?"

03/16/2021,stocks,40 shares at $5 average. I never had a chance.
03/16/2021,stocks,"In the article, it seems that this is the result of restructuring not removing redundancies. Surely some redundant positions and employees are going to be let go in this, as restructures are often accompanied by some form of internal audit as well, but it is certainly <11% redundancies. 

There's also a big question mark with how much you ought to be managing for redundancy reduction, and operational efficiency. Your manager comes to you and says they need a new person for whatever projects/long term goals you're shooting for, what do you do? Do an in-depth assessment of their needs while they are totally understaffed just on the off chance that your mid-level manager is entirely incompetent or self-serving? That seems like a good way to avoid redundancy/waste, but a terrible way to run an agile business. 

In the case that they need that employee, and don't get it so you lose buyers or sellers or clients because of it, that cost will likely VASTLY outweigh the cost of another employee even if the employee stays with you for 30 years. Keep an eye on your margins, and move or cut people if they're impacting the bottom line on each account/segment of your business. 

I'm not a CEO, so I'm sure it's even more complicated than I'm laying it out, but surely when you get to an organization with 100K people you can't keep everything 100% perfectly efficient. In the same way that an economy basically *has* to have some non-zero percent unemployment, I assume that a business has to have either a non-zero percent of redundancy or some non-zero percent of overworked employees. There's no reasonable way to have 0% of both."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yup.

All mass layoffs do is show you have incompetent managers.

Wither the company is in trouble, or employee productivity has been allowed to become a problem."
03/16/2021,stocks,"No one is celebrating it that I can see, but the sentiment from many people on here seem to think that layoffs should never happen including the OP.  Businesses need to be able to adjust their labor where they feel it needs to be.  If that means people get let go than so be it.  As I said in another post, people should always be prepared to lose their job as it could happen to anyone.  Companies only pay you for past work, not future."
03/16/2021,stocks,Nobody celebrates it. If the stock goes up that is a market force.

03/16/2021,stocks,"I agree that it's a sign of bad management. Put simply, they didn't have the correct number of employees in the first place.

Also, yes people can choose to invest in whatever they want for whatever reason.

Now about the fact of the managers not getting laid off, well that was my point. The system allows for the people causing the problem to keep their jobs while others don't. That's not on Nokia, that's the general economic/employment system itself that allows and even encourages it."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't see why it's bad management. We've got a dinosaur tech company trying to modernise themselves. If they don't, probably everyone will lose their job. That would be bad management in my mind."
03/16/2021,stocks,"This is series of layoffs is part of a larger restructuring project and besides, the new ceo is only fixing the mistakes made by the previous ceo."
03/16/2021,stocks,What is the largest cost for a company?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Well, the idea is similar to body building.

Body builders go through bulking and cutting cycles. When you're bulking you're trying to put on muscle. It is IMPOSSIBLE to avoid putting on some fat, but you try to limit it as much as you can.

Then comes time to cut all that fat. Now, when you cut fat it is IMPOSSIBLE to avoid cutting SOME muscle but again, you try to limit it as much as you can.

If you can put on 90% muscle and 10% fat and then cut 90% fat and 10% muscle, that's really good.

Same concept with companies. You go in cycles and try and make these bulks and cuts as efficiently as possible."

I’m incredibly familiar with Nokia and their technologies, but anything I post gets immediately downvoted in favour of “to the moon!” So I’d never get any visibility anyways.

In short, Nokia has a horrible reputation in the field and is known for low quality R&D / support. They are the lowest paying company among all their competitors so they can’t retain talent. They’ve been losing a TON of contracts recently so they’re laying off 10% of their work force. It is an absolute free for all for engineers to leave right now. Their R&D departments are in absolute shambles. The company I work at has been hiring a fuck ton of Nokia engineers and we really aren’t paying them very well in comparison to our pre-covid salaries.

I was let go along with a ton of other people on month 8 with a good severance and that was that. Wouldn't do it again because I prefer to actually be productive,  learn, and. build my resume but that's with hindsight.

03/16/2021,stocks,"It certainly depends on the company. I know a lot of large and establish companies who spent the last decade firing employees during good economic times because they wanted to exceed profit expectations for shareholders, or to buyback their own stocks to inflate the prices. Famously, I think in 2013 TD posted record profits AND THEN downsized so the following year they could hit record profits again.

The limited competition within the keiretsu combined with shushin koyo led to highly inefficient practices, and a stagnant economy and stock market. Because a keiretsu company has the backing of government knows it can readily access capital, it could easily take on too much debt and overly risky strategies. Hence the asset inflation in the 90's of which it has never recovered.

03/16/2021,stocks,"And there is an endless supply of humans to do it.  People think they are more important to their business than they really are.  The work will get done with or without you.  The quality may not be the same, but it will get done."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm also at the bottom of the food chain, but these at the top get paid so much because they are not as exchangable as everyone else. There won't be a rebalancing, their work is just worth a ton of money, otherwise they wouldn't be paying it to them."
03/16/2021,stocks,This is a 100% accurate depiction of what we’ve been dealing with this year.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Sure they can. And in our case, because they wanted to reduce headcount further than the layoffs, they let many good people walk out the door. Layoff years also usually mean pay freezes. No raises or promotions etc."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Sure they can, a good number of those people laid off will coast on their unemployment instead of looking for a new job. Having the job call them back in makes them feel important and can make them feel more loyalty to the company.

Literally happened to my best friend. The local manufacturer laid off about 1/3 of their production staff. Friend went on unemployment. A few months later closed a different facility and moved the remaining work to the main plant. Rehired anyone laid off who'd come back. When the work was done the company laid them off again. Friend went back on unemployment."

03/16/2021,stocks,It’s not ethics it’s proper business skills. Everyone agrees it sucks ass for people to be fired especially over something that isn’t their fault but Nokia has to grow or it will fail. That’s how businesses work. It’s either fire 10k now or everybody later
03/16/2021,stocks,"One thing to keep in mind is that communism would still have ""layoffs"" as needs for society change. The only real difference is a communist government would in theory help transition you into a new job better than a capitalist government. 

Our system is a bottom up approach where the individual is mostly responsible for finding a better fit for a new job to add more societal value. This in theory allocates resources better. The big issue with firing in capitalism is the transition period of uncertainty. That is where the government is supposed to step in to help the transition. We currently offer unemployment benefits which helps bridge the gap. We also do a tiny bit to help find people new jobs. Maybe the best solution should be to offer more government help in the transition period so it's not so scary, as opposed to making the business keep employing people that don't add  value?

I don't find firing unethical at all. It's what makes capitalism a very efficient system, as people that don't add value to a specific business can move to where they do add value to a specific business.  That doesn't mean I don't feel sympathy for people going through the transition period as it's horrible and very scary. I'd be in favor of greater government help during that transition period so it's not so scary and disruptive of an individual's life though."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Thinking companies shouldn't be allowed to restructure and should be forced to employ people for life is communist thinking, yup."

03/16/2021,stocks,"All I'm trying to say is they should've cut redundancies on an on-going basis. It's a management failure, in my opinion, if you didn't cut the job the moment it became obsolete. That's wasted operating cost that could've gone somewhere else. That's why it's bad management."
03/16/2021,stocks,Depends on what industry that company is in.
03/16/2021,stocks,"again. I do not disagree with the general idea, but also the analogy is lacking, simply because in dieting and bodybuilding, you have much more granularity of control. 
whena company cuts so many people, they do not go over th individual performance of eahc and every one to evaluate, simplymost employees do not have any kpi to evaluate. they evaluate branch offices, industry fields, sectors , etc. as a whole. then estimate which one of these offers the best savings ratio compared to costs. its also a fact that letting go of 10k people is much much easier and faster than rehiring even a quarter of the same number."
03/16/2021,stocks,What if they don't fire these people and the company goes bankrupt and all 90000 lose their job?
03/16/2021,stocks,No it's the fault of people believing capitalism is the root of greed when in reality no matter what system we run there will always be greed as well as rich and poor people.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I just don't see why you think that is to be blamed on capitalism? Do you think people in countries like China, Cuba or Venezuela aren't poor? If there was a perfect system, we'd have it, but it simply doesn't exist."

03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m not saying that layoffs are always unavoidable. But 5,000-10,000 is a lot of people to lay off at once. 

I don’t know if you’ve ever been on the inside of a company during a change of guard where there are mass layoffs. I have, and I can tell you that it makes people feel horrible generally—it brings a real feeling of nervousness and people often get overworked trying to pick up where others left. Sometimes, it can work. But if often bodes of major issues in the company. From a management perspective, it’s not fun to suddenly be down that many people."
03/16/2021,stocks,"A real company has competition, how many submarine builders are there? Aircraft carriers? Arms is a private market immune to laws of economics."
03/16/2021,stocks,I think they’re saying they mismanaged both - their phone biz back in the day to their connection to 5G now that has everyone look at them each year like “NOK could be the one” only for them to still suck
03/16/2021,stocks,Yea but it absolutely hinders a company when the people doing the R&D leave. Often it takes 1-3 years for a new person to figure out what they were doing and take the project back up
03/16/2021,stocks,"Red tape is so infuriating. I had a job for 4.5 years that was sort of similar. However it was manager based and not corporate based. He didn't want you to do anything with out his permission. So you would seek permission to resolve an issue and he would say you don't need to ask. So the next time you would do something with out asking you would get chewed out.

It got to the point where you said I just stopped basically working hard or researching. It actually drove me nuts because there's only so much online shopping, hobby searching, internet browsing you can do in a day. Let alone your not progressing in your career so when you interview you can't even really sell yourself on experience from your job.

The only thing about that is I made a decent salary and my job was safe. Now you could say no job is safe, but this company never laid ppl off except for once in the housing market crash but rebounded within 2 years. And other than that never had any layoffs since 97."

03/16/2021,stocks,I don't know.  Every company I worked at it was pulling teeth to get new positions approved.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Ironically, the firm I work for did this. Lol. 60 employees in the first 60 days. 

Edit: technically on Day 0 of the LLC being registered, there was one employee. Two founding partners were included in the first week. And then those three went out and hired 50 employees in two weeks and spent the following 6 weeks completing their administrative staff hires.

Edit 2: this was in 2006, and the company had grown to 240 people in 2008. 75% of our projects fell through in 2008-2009 so they literally laid off 120 people in a span of 6 weeks. Pretty crazy! I joined the firm in 2017 when we were at 80 employees and now we’re back to 60 lol."
03/16/2021,stocks,"No, he didn't finish out the shifts he was scheduled for. He was on the schedule, but then was called in for a meeting and fired. He was taken off the schedule at that point, But if they knew in advance that he was going to be fired. They wouldn't have scheduled him in for 2 more weeks."
03/16/2021,stocks,"The company is doing just fine. It had nothing to do with the companies financial health and everything to do with the fact that the operations manager wanted to make himself look good by getting rid of the highest paid staff member that wasn't a department lead. 

He was the only person in his department to be fired."
03/16/2021,stocks,"We wouldn't be surprised to see a new job listing with a lower starting salary in about a week. The guys were already working a fair bit of overtime, which is only going to get worse.

Unfortunately, we lost most of our savings last year due to 2020 and my husband injured his back pretty badly. We have some left still, but hopefully he can find a new job within the next 2 months."
03/16/2021,stocks,"That is how it is supposed to work, but when you're talking to upper management, all they see are numbers. Removing employees cuts overhead costs, and the remaining employees are expected to increase their own productivity. It is a really dumb idea, but you see it literally all the time when management changes hands.

Edit: They also often hire on new people at a lower wage when the existing staff can't pick up the extra work."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah, I fudged the numbers, thanks. I was putting clerks at $30k and engineers at $150k."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Labour is cheap in a lot of places, unfortunately"
03/16/2021,stocks,"This is true.  When you hire someone for a any reasonable complicated job you have to take into consideration that it will take six to eighteen months to start seeing value from the employee.  For complicated technical jobs it can be two years, and the person may not really come into their own until three.  Before that it is time spent learning the company's unique processes, domain specific information, picking up institutional knowledge, etc.  There is also a large risk when it comes to hiring.  If you have to get rid of them then there is the possibility of lawsuits, expense of finding and hiring someone else, business disruption, and so on.  

When you see a resume of someone who has not stayed in place for longer than a couple of years then it is often better to move one to one with a more stable employment history."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Every CEO of F500 companies would like to have a word with you.

03/16/2021,stocks,"True, but not at the speed or reach that is happening now. In the industrial revolution it was the manufacturing side that was automated, now everything is being automated, even down to court proceedings:

AI and by nature automation is replacing even the most human of tasks. Your job applications are screened by a computer long before they get anywhere near a human. Your creditwortiness is decided by a computer looking at your spending habits and how you run your bank account. Drones are being used to deliver COVID vaccine supplies. Even software testing is automated. 

There will come a point where too many people are automated out of jobs too quickly and the economy will become unsustainable unless something is not put in place to counter this. Following the industrial revolution people moved into other areas and new jobs were created but this took time. If every company goes down the automation route and lays off large portions of their workforce the number of people who will buy the products and services on offer will dwindle and the companies will fail. It is a self-perpetuating scenario with every company racing to increase profitablility and decrease costs that translate to short term profits but long term troubles."
03/16/2021,stocks,That was automation of increased production capacity in brand new industries. We're now facing automation of existing jobs.

You leave your job unexpectedly (which is rare, considering two weeks notices) and the company loses slight profits until they hire your replacement. 

Your job fires you unexpectedly? Say goodbye to your way of life. Insurance, income, benefits, all gone."
03/16/2021,stocks,Sorry to hear that
03/16/2021,stocks,Well that depends on the job but for the most part it’s true.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah, at worst the company has to pay a bit more money to fix something that breaks. Meanwhile you can only go so long without an income before you start losing your basic necessities."
03/16/2021,stocks,"that is SO wrong lol. Most of those people in upper management have no idea how to do the job of their subordinates. They maintain these positions with bloated management (which is quickly becoming outdated) and many of them are far more replaceable than those below them. 

Obviously there are still driven entrepreneurs out there but that isn't really what we are talking about. There are billions of dollars paid out every year to upper management people who don't deserve their positions at all. Some are very valuable, but most aren't."
03/16/2021,stocks,"This is only convincing me that USA's unemployment system is broken. If you got fired and it wasn't your fault, developed EU countries pay your full salary for 2-4 months, but after that you're alone - you're supposed to find a job during that time."

Not so sure right now"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Sadly the truth, but a company who's good with their employees has happier employees who are more productive and that should be used to everybodys advantage, but not a lot of company's seem to understand that"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Just because someone gets let go doesn’t mean they were told to get their shit and get the fuck out. My company let 80-100 people go at a plant that hadn’t been profitable in years. They knew 3-6 months in advance, anyone who had been there for any significant time got a decent severance package, insurance for another 6 months, and they waited til after the 1st of the year, which is when everyone’s PTO resets, which they paid them out for. I thought it was a pretty decent mix of doing what the business needed to and the people working there needed. Hopefully NOK does something similar."
03/16/2021,stocks,Seriously. This site has gone off the rails. Feelings > everything. Even common sense these days. Annoying
03/16/2021,stocks,"I disagree, there's other solutions than the two extremes. There are ethical ways to layoff employees and investors should expect better from these companies.

Why can't companies work with their labor forces to find a better solution?"

03/16/2021,stocks,"You have a very misinformed understanding of communism, friend."

03/16/2021,stocks,"typical commie, no argument to present, just ""please stop boo hoo"""
03/16/2021,stocks,So you're saying the mistake is they didn't cut early enough?
03/16/2021,stocks,">Not to say socialism is inherently right and capitalism inherently wrong. Ideologies be damned, world is a fuck regardless. *Gotta live through and make the best of it.*

Historically, socialist countries had their own unique issues (i.e. purges, heavy censorship, terrible standards of livin but stuff now is not perfect either, just as you said. Stock market is not exactly free from ethical complications, and plenty of labor exploitation today (for example) is due to capitalistic principles of min/maxing profits.

It's fair to blame socialism's failings on the corruption and ineptitude of the soviet states as much as it is fair to blame current phenomenon on a largely capital-driven world economy. That's all I wanted to remark.

Edit: you already said yourself

03/16/2021,stocks,Yes but I’d imagine the people being cut are in roles that aren’t critical to R&D
03/16/2021,stocks,I feel you. For me is I didn’t get the tools I needed to actually do the job well and for this job you need at least a few software  tools to get roi from my job so I twiddled my thumbs a lot. My bosses were cool and supportive but just as constrained. It was a structural problem at Nokia and not a manager problem. I feel I would hate the manager problem more. I always feel like I work for people and not companies.

Fuck...sounds bleak. 

Did you ever consider getting another job to do while you were at work?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Maybe because whoever approves new positions knows this, and doesn’t want to have to downsize, so only wants to create a new position if it’s absolutely needed...that, or because they just want to work people like dogs to get as much bang for the buck as possible"
03/16/2021,stocks,I was the former manager at the main warehouse of one of the nation's largest private tire dealers and we fought to hire much needed positions as well. When we didn't it just meant I had to work more 16+ hour days... For months straight. That was fun.

Now go look at youth unemployment in France, Spain, Italy.  It is a total shitshow.   There are upsides and downsides to everything.

It's a complete joke and framed as empowering employees because it says you can leave a job at any time without notice, but it goes both ways so a business doesn't need to give you any notice either.

In practice it means people still give 2 weeks notice before quiting because of culture, but businesses can and will fire you at any time without a heads up and for any reason (except explicitly prejudice against protected classes, so instead of ""you're fired because you're black/disabled/a woman"" they can only say ""you're fired"")."

I left because I couldn't handle the bipolarness of his personality. One day your doing a great job, the next you didn't ask to do something, or no one's as smart as me, but yet your not giving me any responsibility to grow in my career or experience. Also reviews weren't reviews, they didn't really evaluate you as an employee and would basically set goals for you. But when I would work towards those goals they would say that's not priority today, there's another fire to put out. 

I finally used my network after slowly searching for the right job. Got lucky that a company my then previous company worked with had positions available. I reached out to an alum of the university I went too about a position and he got me in the door.

It is true as much as I hate networking sometimes because some less qualify ppl abuse it how handy it game be."
03/16/2021,stocks,"So not in an office job anymore, but working in a craft cocktail setting (love it). It does feel stressful here to have such a small staff. I get to work full time and make great money/benefits, but time off is difficult to get. But on the flip side, I’ve worked bartending gigs where getting more than three hours a shift was impossible. This was for a dive bar and the crew was notoriously flakey and expecting them to commit full time consistently was impossible. So there was always twice as much staff as was necessary. Also it makes it hard to feel a sense of purpose when there is so much staff on hand that the business doesn’t really *need* you. Plus retail jobs suck when you can’t get full time hours.

On the flip side, I’ve worked as junior engineer for a few years and it sucked. Getting hired to work 2 out of 8 hours but being forced to sit for the other six day after day is dreadful. And every four months you might get hit with a project that keeps you busy for two weeks. Than once that’s done you’re back to staring at the wall."

Calling ourselves a start-up is a little gratuitous because our founders were really just executives from a globally renowned company for a decade+, and simply broke off to form their own business. 

We were able to outfit 50 employees in a month because the founders headhunted many of their former colleagues that they used to work with."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Lol you're missing the point in a big way. Those jobs are rarely open recruitment, they come from networking. 

I work on salary and work crazy hours. Pay me 200k+ a year and I have no problem taking calls at 4AM"
03/16/2021,stocks,"The US of A also fakes our unemployment drastically. They do not, like the French or any other European country count underemployed, you get removed from the statistic after a certain amount of time, and under a certain age or over you don’t count either. Don’t trust the US unemployment numbers cause we have a very significant number of people that are underemployed or have been unemployed long enough to no longer land in the statistic"
03/16/2021,stocks,Lol you also don’t have to give notice as an employee.
03/16/2021,stocks,"That's nice! I work for Volkswagen in Germany and their workers rights are honestly superb (Thanks union) and I don't think I'll ever switch to another workplace (until I get fired i guess lol). I heard that Tesla is already treating their people like shit in Germany, pay less and don't want to work together with their union, and I hope Tesla is gonna understand soon that they don't have another choice but to work together with the Union lol"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Of course, examples entirely **depends** on the situation of the company and their internal structures, but here are some ideas I thought of...

* Senior staff (Executives, VPs, etc.) could take pay cuts to prevent lay offs. Nintendo did this when the WiiU flopped.
* Tenured employees could take early retirements / part-time agreements. Volkswagen Germany did this to eventually cut 4,000 jobs. 
* Employees can be retrained and moved to different areas. I don't have an example of this, but it's common in US corporate culture.

Those are just three examples, and I don't know entirely what Nokia plans on doing in detail. The point being there's better solutions to terrible situations."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Who said anything about forcing a company to employ people? An individual saying that they don't want to support a company is not ""forcing"" them to do anything, and it certainly doesn't involve the government."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Communism still has a definition, it isn’t just whatever you want to make it. I don’t see anyone forcing anyone to do anything, I see someone making a decision on what stocks they buy and what stocks they don’t, as all investors have the freedom to do."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You don't want to lay people off until you know it's really necessary though, and that you have a better strategy approved at the top level. And also it's not practical to pick them off one by one, that's devastating for morale"

03/16/2021,stocks,"That sounds like it was an extremely toxic work environment. 

I'm glad to hear you're in a better place now. 

...and yes, networking *works*! There is no shame in it, especially if you actually have skills to offer and a desire to work- it's mutually beneficial! The people who have tje power to abuse it give it a bad name, I agree. 


Thanks for answering my questions. Take care! :)"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Switching from engineering to craft cocktail sounds like quite the lifestyle change. That's awesome that you found something you really enjoy.

03/16/2021,stocks,"No you're missing the point. You claim no one in upper management knows how to do their subordinate's jobs. 

You don't know how to do upper management's job. So what makes you the expert in telling the world that upper management is useless? 

You've never done the job. Maybe you should start ""networking"" and then you can get up there too. 

It's not hard finding listings for C level jobs. Go for it."

Those are the questions that counter your examples, and in most lay-off cases, the answer is no. 10k employees is a lot to find a home for."
03/16/2021,stocks,Getting close to it when Redditors are grasping at straws mentioning labor laws. Choice is great when it stays as a choice.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah I should know better than to try and engage with the rabble, most people lack critical thinking skills or the ability to analyze things at more than a basic surface level, their education and indoctrination has taught them to ""think"" with their feelings. 

Best to focus on self-improvement and enrichment and let them shout at the sky about how bad capitalism is while they drink their Starbucks sugar water in their Jordans while they play on their iPhones."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Sure, I get that, but companies usually have projections and targets they need to hit for the year. If you know the trajectory of the company, you can usually get a good feel on what's going to be necessary and what is going to be wasteful in the near future. If you're a top brass and made a decision that ended up to be wrong, then now you have a reference point for next year."
03/16/2021,stocks,"yea, floor was really sticky, who was in this theatre earlier??"
03/16/2021,stocks,Right? Really unsure where they thought that argument was going to take them...
03/16/2021,stocks,"No, I didn't claim that lol. I know how to do the upper management's job at MY SPECIFIC COMPANY. And how do you know what I've done? Stop being an asshole."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I see both sides of this. I report directly to upper management and often find them to be vastly inefficient, poor consumers of technology, and generally underproducing in terms of tangible outcomes.

On the flip-side, there is a lot of networking, relationship building, person/process management, and strategic decision making performed at that level. 

I think one issue is that the people in the executive positions *tend* to be extremely inefficient with respect to current technology, and are relying on their direct and indirect reports to produce simple reports and other tangible work. A second cascading effect of the tech knowledge deficit in upper management is that they tend to make strategic decisions without sufficient understanding of the technological implications."
03/16/2021,stocks,"The inverse is true with employers as well, but it’s not common that employees ever go back to an employer that lays them off. I’d certainly feel better if my employer gave me a head’s a couple weeks before, if they told me to get my stuff and get out I’d go out of my way to shit all over them on Glassdoor and certainly would never consider working there again.

But in general notice is a courtesy in the US. Nobody owes anybody anything, which is fucked but it is what it is."

2021-03-16 15:46:31,stocks,"Long-term investing in ETFs and Real Estate funds I have been playing around with stocks and options, but I also want to have a safe fund that I can add to monthly and will grow over time thanks to compound interest. My long term target is 10+ years, but I also want to see some decent gains before that.

I see that Vanguard funds give you around 3% dividends per year with an average growth of 5-10% depending on the fund. However, they generally track the world's economy, which means if I somehow get in at the wrong time, I could really screw myself out of a lot of money. It looks like the S&P has fully recovered from covid and then some, so I'm not really sure it's going to keep climbing like that. It just seems like a bad time to invest in the market as a whole.  
The alternative is to invest in a single company that pays higher dividends, but of course that's much riskier depending on the company I choose- if the stock itself goes down due to bad company news, my savings do too.  
So I was thinking of using 1/4 of the savings for emergency cash, 1/4 for stocks and options, 1/4 in a safe ETF and 1/4 in a REIT, which can potentially grow a lot this year and has very high dividends. I will hold the REIT for as long as it's profitable, then sell and reinvest in something else.  
Does this sound like a reasonable plan? Is there any specific funds I should look into? I am still in the research phase, but I'd like to start investing soon-ish.  


Keep in mind that I am located in Europe, so I can only access European ETFs (or European versions of US ones).  Also, I am using Interactive Brokers currently, is there any downside to using an US-based broker to invest in an EU fund long-term?"
03/16/2021,stocks,It’s better to be in the market then try to time the market
03/16/2021,stocks,I think you’ll love O$ they pay monthly dividend and are moving.
03/16/2021,stocks,"If you dont invest in the total market now, and it keeps going up, you'll also screw yourself out of a lot of money.

No one, absolutely no one, knows what the market or even individual stocks are going to do in the near future. The only thing anyone can say with any reasonable amount of certainty is that in 20 years the market will almost certainly be higher than it is now.

If your goal is optimal returns, you best bet is always to invest in total market index funds whenever you have the money to do so"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm partial to the 4 fund, and use esgv as my main US stock/etf, and that international version of that as well.   Good for you!!"
2021-03-16 14:57:28,stocks,"Other brokerage like Fidelity with instant cash to trade? I was wondering if there were other brokerage that allows up to 25k instant transfer like fidelity does.
Fidelity is nice and all, but it feels like their “quality of life” seems a bit out dated.
Webull has the live order books, $ or % buying/selling, and more indicators. But they take awhile to have funds available to trade

Is there any Brokerage like fidelity that is a little more up to date? Thanks"
03/16/2021,stocks,The lack of a live ticker on fidelity is the most painful part of the app.
03/16/2021,stocks,Do you use Fidelity's Active Trader Pro?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Fidelity app is garbage, their website isn't a whole lot better. But Active trader is pretty functional and customizable. I switched after the Jan bullshit too and I would appreciate a better app, but beyond that I'm super happy with fidelity. Had some questions on options and margin when I setup my account, customer service is excellent and knowledgeable."
03/16/2021,stocks,ETrade
03/16/2021,stocks,"TD wanted me to wait 5 days to buy after I transferred money. That's ridiculous. I use boring old Vanguard from my retirement stuff, so I just started doing it from there. Their platform is ridiculous, their data and research is basically non-existent, there's nothing sexy about them at all. But what I love is no fee trades and that I can move money over and literally start using it in seconds.
So I do that and some paid apps for my research, etc."
03/16/2021,stocks,TD Ameritrade is instant
03/16/2021,stocks,Are you in US or EU?
03/16/2021,stocks,Schwab updates pretty continually. I rather like them. I have some stuff at Fidelity too and I agree it’s a bit dated looking.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Think ahead, transfers usually take 3-5 days on Schwab or Fidelity.  Unless you setup some super-duper instant transfer, you might have to contact customer support for that."
03/16/2021,stocks,I use Webull and Moomoo to look at quotes and for alerts and just use Fidelity for the actual buying/selling. It’s a bit more tedious but works well enough.
03/16/2021,stocks,Try Robinhood.

03/16/2021,stocks,Such a huge company and they can’t make a decent app.  Where is the management?
03/16/2021,stocks,"My tickers are live as long as I’m logged in, do you mean the 15 minute delay when logged out?"
03/16/2021,stocks,I thought you can activate quote streaming for that.
03/16/2021,stocks,Do they have an app?
03/16/2021,stocks,"I currently have E-trade, and Interactive Brokers account is being transferred to TastyWorks.  E-Trade is the only one of the three that allows for instant deposit credit once account is established/bank accounts linked."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I love TD. Based on my experience, they take a little time with you, yes. But once your reliability is proven, etc... transfers of cash are instantly approved and usable. It’s a strong platform for my use and I’ve been happy there. The GME debacle of 1/28 notwithstanding."

03/16/2021,stocks,"It is except for low cost OTC stuff. You need settled cash, so have to wait a few days for trades and cash transfers o clear for penny stock buys. This isn't abnormal from other brokers is my understanding."
03/16/2021,stocks,Are we using the same IBKR? My USD transfers take a week
03/16/2021,stocks,I spoke to customer service. They said there throwing a lot of money at revamping the app and trader pro!
03/16/2021,stocks,"And they added literally millions of new users, mostly younger people since the beginning of the year. This should be a huge motivator to update their app and retain these new customers."
03/16/2021,stocks,How do you do that on the app?
03/16/2021,stocks,They have a phone app (Fidelity) and a pc program (Fidelity Active Trader Pro).
03/16/2021,stocks,The question was who gives instant access to deposit. What broker do you use? Are they instant?
03/16/2021,stocks,They locked margin buys only.

03/16/2021,stocks,"A large majority of people looking for brokers right now are moving because of the fiasco last month. It’s fine if TD has instant deposit, I’m just adding extra context. I’ve moved from Robinhood to Fidelity myself. On 1/28 I was going from brokerage to brokerage trying to find one to let let me buy GME and TD was right there with all the other shit stains so it feels imperative to remind others that they participated. Fidelity did not. I’ll sacrifice pretty graphs for not getting fucked in the ass any day."
03/16/2021,stocks,They shouldn’t have locked anything.
03/16/2021,stocks,I am in EU
03/16/2021,stocks,I dont see streaming enabled as an option. I have a galaxy s9 if that means anything
03/16/2021,stocks,"Ehhh. When your clearing house says they won't allow margin purchases, you're at their mercy. They kept cash buys, so you were still able to buy GME/etc, so they weren't the problem, not were they responsible for the massive crash."
03/16/2021,stocks,"https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/how-to-get-real-time-quotes

2021-03-16 13:47:46,stocks,"What if you buy US stocks with a foreign currency and the value of the dollar goes up? My broker account is in PLN and I bought a bunch of US stocks when the USD was worth 3.72 PLN, and now it's around 3.85 PLN, so I'm up 3-4% on just the currency difference. My portfolio is about 1/2 SP500 ETF, 1/4 Apple, and 1/4 in Blackberry.

I'm no expert, but I feel like it's bound to drop down back to the 3.70 levels eventually, and I'm wondering if I can take advantage of this somehow (especially the SP500 ETFs, as 3-4% usually takes a few months). These are stocks that I'm hoping will go up anyway, so I'm a bit worried that I'll sell them now and they'll shoot up when I'm no longer in the game.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"
03/16/2021,stocks,"You bought an asset in USD by “selling” PLN. So, in effect when you bought these stocks, you also went long on the dollar. Any dollar strengthening will result in a bigger payout in PLN. But if the aim was to profit off of dollar appreciation of these assets then you should continue to hold them regardless of dollar’s strength against PLN. You need to look at it in terms of overall return in PLN (from capital appreciation of assets less dollar depreciation/plus dollar appreciation wrt PLN, if that’s the currency you eventually wish to cash out in. I hope this made some sense."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes, buying assets in a foreign currency opens you up to currency risk, both up- and downside. I personally wouldn't worry about it as a small investor, as long as you stick to stable markets. I do, however, as an EU small investor myself, try to hold a significant amount (roughly 50%) of my portfolio in local euro-nominated assets. Just so that not all of my portfolio would be exposed to currency risk, as well as to diversify on markets and honestly, I just know my local companies better than most US companies."
03/16/2021,stocks,"With individual stocks, short of buying/selling them, there's not much you can do about the currency fluctuations. You can spread out the currency risk by buying ETFs etc. for different currency-countries/zones, like GBP or Eurozone assets.

Since you're in Europe it's worth noting that there are Euro hedged ETFs  tracking US indices available. Including a Euro-hedged S&P ETF would change your current USD exposure to include a Euro exposure - benefitting you when the Euro strengthens against the dollar."
03/16/2021,stocks,"For EU, i believe the dollar will continue to gradually weaken against the euro if things continue as they are, so keeping some stocks in a local currency not a bad idea. 

That said, if you pay transaction fees, it may still be cheaper to buy and sell US stocks. If you don't any pay fees, then it's in your interest to keep to the Euro as much as possible."

I am sure there is still more upwards growth, but am not nearly as confident. With 200% gains, this is now nearly 65% of my portfolio, and I’m wondering if there was any plays you guys were looking at, or if I should just throw it into SPY. I’d love to hear your thoughts."
03/16/2021,stocks,I got nervous and dipped out last week took 65%gains and am happy with that I guess it's down to you and your risk levels

03/16/2021,stocks,What is the reason behind you thinking this is the top? 20% of my portdolio is nclh.
03/16/2021,stocks,Make sure to always consider the difference in tax obligations between short-term and long-term holds. It may benefit you to wait until you’ve held it for a year so it qualifies for long-term capital gains taxes. You will have to do the calculation and decide for yourself based on your risk tolerance and your tax rate.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I sold about 150 shares of that and carnival a week and half ago. I put that money into apple. Figured it was a safer bet. I was happy with the returns I got, but felt like I was flirting with the devil on that one so decided to dip out."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Other people were commenting about this and were saying that when you factor in the share dilutions, the market cap is the same as the company was pre-pandemic when ships were sailing. For that reason, I sold out and booked a 40% gain."

03/16/2021,stocks,I've downgraded alot of my riskier plays as we are looking to buy a house this year. I've put a bit into Tesla to average down. Chucked a few fun tokens in gme (doing ok on that actually) other then that I've just topped up a few smaller positions howmet aerospace I've doubled down on steady growth since they split the company. Nothing amazing if I'm honest I'm just going for 10% growth on a few stocks while I wait for pandemic to end then I'll be looking to sell pretty much everything for the house deposit and start again 😞
03/16/2021,stocks,You downgraded you riskier plays and bought GME and TSLA? What were those risky plays that made GME feels safer? Russian Roulette?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Gme for $60 is just fun tokens like I said it's up now if it stays up great if it goes down I've lost out on nothing much compared to these people putting life changing money on there. Tesla I got in too high saw the opportunity to average down and took it I'm out 3% currently I'd like to see it bounce back as there is alot of hype with the company, that alone can be enough to drive it back up enough to at least return me to even money. I was never in this for the long haul but seeing my house deposit money gathering dust in a savings account while I break my balls everyday trying to add to it was getting me nowhere.
Figured I'd try my hand at this and I'm doing ok so far , good enough to consider moving my pensions to a sipp next year."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

03/16/2021,stocks,"**Stock Market Forecast**

Pretty much anything could happen today.

Retail sales reports, released today, were literally 6X worse than forecast. The Fed's making an announcement tomorrow. There's a bond auction today. Everything fundamental suggests today should be awful -- but futures are skyrocketing and, in technical analysis, everything looks incredibly bullish.

I'm going to predict a green day with a NASDAQ ~~high of 13,595 and a low of 13,379.~~ *Let's go even more bullish - high of 13,700 and low of 13,450, potential 2% daily gain.*

I might be wrong about this one. Humiliate me when I am. It motivates me to learn.

*[Past predictions can be seen here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/1Jw6B)*

03/16/2021,stocks,"Will be interesting to see if NASDAQ continues to rally today or if it takes a breather.  Ive stated multiple times I believe the correction to be over and considering we've regained around 60% since the low of 12,600, I'm thinking we are in the clear.

Grab them tech stocks while they are still on discount because we will be hitting new All Time Highs on most of them in the next 2-3 months!!"

It may be okay in the long-run, but for the size market cap it has, its balance between upside and downside still seems way higher than it should be.

Anyway, looks like prices are plummeting after GE announced extremely similar tech yesterday, and I'm not sure what to do. I'm taking an acceptable loss selling off everything right now, but I do think that the company could bounce back long-term and still have a good share of the market with its head start and amazing team. Is the play to hold until it gets green, even if that's over a year from now, and maybe average down when things get to like the $13-14 line which I'm worried could happen, to sell now and reconsider getting back in at that point, or to hold and hope that it gets back to the 50 day moving average after people calm down about the news?"

03/16/2021,stocks,"Yesterday my father-in-law told me he predicts (right away my red flags went up because I don't believe in timing the market) that the stock market will crash in Q3.  I knew he was just regurgitating some YouTube video he probably came across and didn't do actual DD. He then told me to sell all my shares around June or July and hold the cash, and take out everything in my wife's 401k and move it into a type of holding account to where it doesn't look like a withdrawal so it won't be taxed and we won't be penalized, but the money isn't being invested so it's safe from the market crash.  


All this sounded like horrible advice because if the market does crash in Q3, I know that my stupid brain is just going to see all that red and be happy that I get to buy more shares of all my favorites in my portfolio at a discount.    


However, I'm also a top tier moron and don't know much of anything.  So, I ask you guys, was this solid advice from my father-in-law?  As a long-term investor, should I take this suggestion seriously about selling shares and moving money out of my wife's 401k for safe keeping because he knows the stock market will crash?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Does anyone feel like the market is close to ""complete saturation of stock growth potential""?

i.e. - tech was overvalued >  sector rotation into non-tech growth and value stocks > partial rotation back into tech >  now both tech and value are fairly valued /overvalued. retail is overvalued.

There are no clear opportunities, other than crypto.

At this point, do institutions then take the ""next best option"" and start diversifying into more stable investments (bonds etc), which would result in a sell off of tech/value stocks and a general decline over the next few years?  They would then buy the dips that result from these sector rotations.

The better question is can tech hide this, it did in January for a little while before volatility was a mess in the final days of trade for the month. Kind of did today (a move like this by the S&P or even the Dow is not that noteworthy off a good winning streak), but not as well as it did a couple months back."

I'm looking to buy a position in this ETF, but my broker only offers it on LSE and I'm really confused as to the difference between them. I've asked a few people and was unable to get any answer.

I realise they're being traded on two different exchanges, with different opening times, and I realise the LSE one is lower volume. But why are they at such different prices? Not just for a day, but if you look at the chart they've been trading at different prices for quite a while. On NYSEArca, it went up to as high as $64 in the last year, while on LSE it went up to $41. Why so much difference?

There's also [GJGB.L on LSE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GJGB.L) which tracks the same ETF but in GBP, and if you ignore the last couple of weeks, it's basically the same chart as GDXJ.L. One is in USD and the other is in GBP, yet the prices are the same? For example on the 16th of July, GDXJ.L was $35 and GJGB.L was £35. I'd almost think both GDXJ.L and GJGB.L are in GBP, but that's apparently not the case. Yahoo Finance, my broker Degiro, and the VanEck website all say the former is USD and the latter is GBP.

Really confused as to what's going on here. Could anyone help me out? Thanks."

03/16/2021,stocks,"A lot of youngsters here were obsessing over GME. Of course, these people are more into quick money."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Never listen, I am long-term investor.  His statements only effect short term momentum players.  Just my opinion.   Good Luck"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't think hes going to say much of anything.  ""We are holding course"".  ""We are monitoring the situation"".  That kind of stuff.

I think you are right on the dip, then it will gain it all back by the end of the week"
03/16/2021,stocks,Tech to the moon
03/16/2021,stocks,Bad news is good news.
03/16/2021,stocks,They're not predictive at all except barely in a broad general direction sense over a sufficiently long term.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Market cap. It’s already a huge company with their fingers in literally everything. The streaming kept them very healthy through covid

/Disney sucks but the stock is solid for slow growth"
03/16/2021,stocks,"It's like 40% above pre-covid prices, when all the theme parks were open.

So I think streaming and theme park revenue is already baked into the price.

Not many stocks are 40% above pre-covid prices"

03/16/2021,stocks,Isn't this related to robux cards being treated differently than normal income? Almost like a net debit? That would explain some of it at least.
03/16/2021,stocks,Feels like it might be too late to jump on that train...
03/16/2021,stocks,I’m in already. Can’t decide if I should buy more or not. Got in at 27.05. Thinking of waiting a week or so to let it come down a little.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Solid buy around $200, but I think PayPal has a better long-term growth potential."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think it's a buy at $200 or below but because of my impatience I might bite again a little earlier (not here though).

Think it's a good way to play an improving economy."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think Visa is fairly priced, maybe slightly over priced currently."
03/16/2021,stocks,"The credit card? I like Mastercard better. Mastercard feels more ubiquitous, at least in Europe."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm breakeven, which is frustrating considering Nasdaq is up so much and i have plenty of tech. I blame ICLN"
03/16/2021,stocks,??? You must have a tech heavy portfolio
03/16/2021,stocks,Why? Looks like it's doing great if you ask me.
03/16/2021,stocks,Its still so high tho
03/16/2021,stocks,He's going to announce he is not going to use a bazooka for a 0.1% increase in 10 yr yield because its irrevelant so the market will throw a tantrum.
03/16/2021,stocks,"He burned our crops, poisoned our water supply, and delivered a plague unto our houses."

03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm not selling my ICLN and i am also feeling dumb...


APES STRONG TOGETHER


/s"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm in long term. But this is pretty frustrating because it's a totally unnecessary fuckup. I got in at around 15 and did some profit taking at 60, holding for the forseeable future, not selling more at this price."
03/16/2021,stocks,For people with alot of money though its guaranteed income whereas stocks are more risky
03/16/2021,stocks,You literally make nothing if you account for inflation right?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Pretty sure they're very relevant for loans, since people are less inclined to give low interest rates when they could instead just loan to the US government. The higher the bond yield, the more competitive the US government becomes for loaners, so they raise interest rates on all their other loans

Obviously this isn't great for growth companies since they will be looking to take out large loans to expand and re-invest in their future growth. It also hurts the normal economy because people will struggle to get good mortgage rates on houses."
03/16/2021,stocks,This is why I don't understand why they seem to have so much impact in the stock market?
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't have a position yet, but I like the way things are looking. If Phase 3 goes well, the company will request FDA Emergency Use Authorization. That would be big."
03/16/2021,stocks,Do you have a DD on it? Interested in buying.
03/16/2021,stocks,"my average is 56.38....I'm still adding too.

I'm long on this position. ARKG as well."
03/16/2021,stocks,I don't think anyone has ever been regretful about holding AAPL long term.
03/16/2021,stocks,Fucking yes. Def going back to pre covid highs at some point. And that point imo is coming in the next months
03/16/2021,stocks,Chip shortage maybe? F and GM both said it would affect production.
03/16/2021,stocks,Yes
03/16/2021,stocks,"There are ways, but it's as much an art as a science.

Basically, you're just asking: ""How do I know when the dip is at the bottom?"", which is effectively the same as: ""How do I perfect stock trading?"""
03/16/2021,stocks,"Due Diligence will show you the difference. If you believe the company still has a future of success. Then buying the dip is good. If the company Executives and whales are selling their shares of the company, it’s a “falling knife”."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If you see value in a company that isn’t being reflected in their current price, that’s a buying opportunity (“buy the dip”). The price could always sink lower (“catching a falling knife”).

Bottom line is that if you think the value of the company isn’t correctly reflected in their share price, buy the company and hold onto it until you feel like that’s no longer the case. This process could take days, weeks, months, or years—you just never know."
03/16/2021,stocks,Nope
03/16/2021,stocks,"Watch the technical indicators — especially the MACD lines. When they're indicating a potential bottom, buy. When they show that there's likely more room to fall, don't buy."
03/16/2021,stocks,Falling knives are companies that are in the process of taking it plummeting hard. You can tell a knife sometimes because of good the company is and how much it's valued
03/16/2021,stocks,ABNB and DIS will go to the moon together

03/16/2021,stocks,Your mistake was buying Ford in the first place
03/16/2021,stocks,Aggressive bond buybacks.
03/16/2021,stocks,"My gut says no. 

What can he say? He'll give a milquetoast protest that they will keep the status quo. 

The question ofc is will the market believe him. 

Rn, the ""value"", banking and reopening stocks are pumped up. Nasdaq is still bubbly. I think we go sideways or hit the skids again before sentiment changes in April

Ofc I know zero"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m down like 5% so far and dropping like a rock, lol."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Click the black ""transfer"" button on the top of your home page. In the ""from"" category, select your brokerage. In the ""to"" category, select your IRA. Click send. This is on desk top, takes maybe 30 seconds"
03/16/2021,stocks,"For a myriad of perfectly valid reasons.

The February retail report came out and was 6X worse than expected.

Bond yields are still increasing, and there's a bond auction attracting unprecedented demand today.

The Fed is making an announcement tomorrow.

My question is: Why were stocks green this morning?"
03/16/2021,stocks,The fear of being afraid of the speech of Jpow which will tell us small temporary inflation is not of worry.
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm taking my money and running. Hurricane Powell coming for us all
03/16/2021,stocks,Its King Bear talking. Just remember that haha
03/16/2021,stocks,"Depends on your risk tolerance, but I'd sell.

Would you rather had a few hundred dollars today or an uncertain amount of money tomorrow?"
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah but if I don’t make money every single day it’s a market crash and hyperinflation incoming
03/16/2021,stocks,What were you fucking with

03/16/2021,stocks,Bonds are being real wacky today.
03/16/2021,stocks,Very sorry for your loss. Any reason why you wouldn’t just hold?
03/16/2021,stocks,No just cap gains
03/16/2021,stocks,"Sorry for your loss.  I just wanted to let you know that the cost basis can be reset to the day you inherited the stock, so it doesn't have to go all the way back to when it was purchased."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Agree, went in for 100 shares of PFE yesterday and may add GILD today"
03/16/2021,stocks,I’m tits up with all my dividend stocks that I bought 2-3 weeks ago like +100 at least
03/16/2021,stocks,">It’s fair value should be around 65$

03/16/2021,stocks,Probably Tech
03/16/2021,stocks,"Sadly, fucking memestocks."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Nope, unfortunately for me i went for the value ASX which is another taiwan semi conductor with tiny PE ratio, but hasn't been going nearly as well as HIMX. Good job lol"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Apparently they are optimistic, but my guess is jpow isn't really gonna change anything and they will throw another tantrum, which jpow will ignore again lol"
03/16/2021,stocks,It’s great the problem is the owner Dolan is an idiot. Still a good play
03/16/2021,stocks,Weren’t consistently profitable prepandemic

03/16/2021,stocks,I think my stock isn't allowed to be mentioned here? Not sure. It starts with a D and ends with an N. Lol. I like it! It's going up like a... like a firework!
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think out of what you said, AMZN is closest to a guarantee there is."
03/16/2021,stocks,AAPL SQ NET NIO PLTR are some of the riskier long term holds I have.
03/16/2021,stocks,"AMZN is an easy hold for that time period. I even think you could add FB and GOOGL.

BMY is on my hold forever list as well. Also holding SBUX and TSLA but maybe not quite a lock for 10 year holds."
03/16/2021,stocks,What’s going on?
03/16/2021,stocks,any idea what happened there? I'm not seeing any obvious headlines
03/16/2021,stocks,1 APHA share will become .83 of a Tilray share. Divide your APHA share average by the Tilray share cost and if it lower than .83 than you’ll make extra profit! Also known as Arbitrage :D
03/16/2021,stocks,Or be real risky and buy in before earnings and make a little more >;)
03/16/2021,stocks,"Seeing how TSLA was green yesterday, and now probably down more than NIO over the past few days despite NIO being in the red the whole time, I wouldn't put too much faith in xpev continually rising."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It's my biggest position, and a good performer for the last year. A year ago, and even 6 months ago, a big part of my justification for buying Softbank was the gap in the market cap and the value of the underlying assets. But today with billions in share buybacks (originally scheduled to end this month) and Alibaba declining they're probably approaching a fair price for the assets, keep in mind they didn't dip nearly as much as the rest of tech stocks the last month or so. 

I think to buy at these prices you have to feel positively about a number of different assets. The first and biggest is Alibaba. The second is ARM which is part of a pending deal with Nvidia which would see Softbank get an 8% or so stake in Nvidia if it goes through, there's a reasonable chance it falls through and personally I think it's fine either way. The third is the Vision Fund projects as a whole. The original Vision Fund is 30% stockholder money with somewhat mixed results, the 2nd is entirely stockholder money that's done well, between the 2 there are about 140 investments with the recent success stories being Doordash and Coupang. IMO those are the 3 big ones that have more upside/downside. 

Then you've got the ""strategic holdings"" of Softbank Corps (telecom in Japan) which I think they mostly hold onto for the dividends, though they sold a chunk of it the last year. Some chunk remaining of Tmobil, which they sold most of their stake of once Sprint started merging with them. Yahoo Japan, which is the preferred search engine and email service for the Japanese language (powered by Google ironically). Northstar which is part of a ""liquidity management strategy"", a subsidiary in the Caymans where they park excess cash after selling assets in publicly traded tech stocks (and options). And the Latin America Fund which is smaller scale investment than the vision fund (managed by a different guy as well) with about 130 last I knew investments in tech companies through the region. 

Going forward I think we'll continue to see the trend of the last year or so, which is whittling down more of the bigger assets to cycle into more venture fund money, and I think that's really where the upside of the stock is. They make a lot of bets but many of them have big enough upside to actually matter for investors. Softbank just gives you substantial exposure to the venture capital market that you can't get exposure to through any other stock. Also it gives you an excuse to watch Masa's bizarre earnings reports. 

There are also 4 SPACs associated with Softbank people, 3 being publicly traded now that haven't announced a merger target yet."
03/16/2021,stocks,If you’re on the fence you could always trim your position and let the rest ride.
03/16/2021,stocks,You should definitely sell.  The risk to the downside/correction is greater than the upside at this point.
03/16/2021,stocks,E BOGHT?

Now that the NASDAQ has hit that support line, though, it appears to be bouncing back up, so this is actually a bullish indicator.

the biggest differenence between 2020's and let's just say a long time ago is the HF firms and the retailers ability to move so quickly that the slow unfolding of market shifts has gone from two weeks, then a week, then a few days, a day or two, and now it's hours. trade the volatility it hasn't been this good in a looooong time"

That's not what happened. There was a lot of inflation fears, so they rotated out of tech. Now that inflation fears are somewhat calmed down, we are seeing rotation back into tech.

03/16/2021,stocks," PUTS ON L BRANDS (LB)

L Brands (owner of Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body works) has been on a meteoric rise, hyped by investment analysts. It's in a classic bubble. Today the stock rose nearly 10% because the board revised earning projects and initiated a stock buyback. Not sure what factors have led this company to believe its earnings will be that good, when its business has been hugely impacted by the pandemic.

Stock is sitting at 61, last time it went above 60 was in 2017, and it dropped like a ROCK after that

At its core, the Victoria Secret brand is a losing business. It's based in shopping malls, which are closing left and right and are on a tremendous decline. Its products are not unique, there are many other brands and stores selling same cheaply made underwear. The stock has had an average PE of about 12, right now its at 18. Retail industry is in a very tough spot, L Brands does not have a strong e-commerce presence."

03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah I just found it kinda laughable.  He fits a certain demographic of old person that watches specific news channels only and believes wild conspiracy theories... So not surprising that he might've stumbled across something on youtube and regurgitated the ideas and presenting them as his own.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah, when they're wrong so many times it's easy to ignore or take as hyperbole but when they're right you know they're going to be on the roofs shouting ""I told you so!"" and they'll feel like they're some kind of financial genius."

One of my keystone philosophies when it comes to investing is that it's impossible to time the market, so him telling me ""for certain"" that the market was gonna crash in Q3 sounded like total nonsense.

Tax rate increases may affect markets short-term, but it’ll be fine. You know what would affect markets a lot more? The US not being able to pay down debt and the USD losing its global reserve currency status.

We’ve been hearing about how tax cuts stimulate the economy for decades, yet every time they cut taxes there’s always a poor schmuck in office a few years later that’s forced to raise them again.

Markets were flatter than my ex-gf for years after the Bush tax cuts. Markets were mediocre in 2018 and 2019. The 2020 bull run was covid-based, not some trickle-down payoff from Trump."

03/16/2021,stocks,"I was looking to cover more larger companies with those ETFs as I am currently heavy in oil/gas, green energy and vaccines. 

My fears are that these major corps that crushed it will take their profits at the end of this year. I just find it hard to understand how a company as large as these like Amazon, MacDonalds, Nike, Tesla, Lowe's, Apple can double their business value during a pandemic. Is that sustainable? I mean it does make sense given all the stimulus, stay at home work savings will funnel to these companies. 

I just dont want to buy at their all time highs but dont know if I should wait until corrections aka when stimulus stops. Or if I should just keep throwing 500 bucks every few weeks at those ETFs. No doubt they will go up as we open up but again, can those high stock prices be sustained."

Also worth noting I recently bought TSLA at $550 when it dipped. I think it has more room to run up. Provided the outlook stays the same I plan on holding it."

03/16/2021,stocks,"No, of course not. If you panic sell, you're a bear.

The type of market fluctuation we saw today is probably mainly caused by day traders doing things like -- well, like I did today.

When the market opened, I was pretty sure growth would go up until we hit resistance at $13,588 and then slow. So I bought at open, waited until $13,588, and then sold.

Because people like me sold, the market started dropping. So I waited until it hit support at $13,390 and I bought again.

And so the market started going back up.

I mean, I didn't do it alone (or at all, since I use option trading to swing trade), but it's people using the same theories and other people panicking in reaction causing these swings."

Have you tried to do any research? Pull up Amazon's 10K, look at their annual report slides and you might learn a few things.

You seem to be thinking that the increase in value was only because of covid, and that these companies will somehow go back down to pre-covid levels cause why exactly?

> will take their profits at the end of this year.

Take them where? Not sure what you are trying to say here. EVERY company takes profits at the end of the year. Look at how they are using that money to grow their business. that's the important part.

If you are investing for a short term goal or short timeline then maybe it makes sense to wait for some names. Maybe Consumer Dis isn't the right sector right now. But this bull market is gonna keep going for another year at least. There will be some pull backs, but it might not be below these levels.

The ""hundreds of billions in direct cash injection"" doesn't mean **** considering the roll that cyclicals had gone on in the market after they struggled in the last half of January (with it being quiet until the volatility mess in the last couple trading days of January). It's time for them to cool off for a bit, and it's probably likely that they're going to quietly struggle for a little while.

Recently they got FDA approval for a fast track designation of a potential medicine called zenocutuzumab (MCLA-128). This medicine was originally created as a breastcancer medicine, but turned out to have potential against a certain type of tumor called NRG1 fusion. The fast track FDA basically means that they expect to have an product within the next upcoming year (or a very expensive useless drug)

Those NRG1 type cancers have an absolute terrible 5 year horizon, and is basically a deathsentence at this moment with a 5yr survival rate of <4%. IF mcla-128 would pass the clinical trials in the upcoming year, they would have the first medicine against NRG1 type tumors, and would also be the first working product of MRUS.

So my question is this:  IF MCLA-128 passes the clinical trial what are the possibilities for the stockprice? I know there are two options a company can do: start producing themselves, of sell a licence for the production to another company. What would this mean for the stockkprice? The company at this moment has a marketcap of $819 million, with a stockprice of $22.

Thanks for your answers"

03/16/2021,stocks,"Can anyone explain why GME has a negative beta, a significant one at that. Yahoo Finance is reporting it’s greater than -2. Yes, that’s a negative. I know shorts can bring beta down, but to bring it down this much plays into the conspiracy that GME short interest is higher than what’s being reported. Negative beta is rare so there isn’t much info out there"

03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm gonna ask here, since i dont think wsb will take this question seriously.  I just bought 5 gme at around 190;  my question is, the downward pressure that wsb claims are short ladder attacks don't seem to do much? or do they?  i guess im unsure what the point is, since it just allows people to average down, and the price seems to go back up.  What is happening on a technical level that is a benifit to the hedge funds (if they are indeed short ladders)?"
03/16/2021,stocks,Do we consider BB a meme stock? I honestly believe the company is making solid direction with the contracts they’re acquiring. I don’t really see another insane pop happening again but a slow climb over the year
03/16/2021,stocks,"I tried to tell people earlier that once GME loses its momentum, it drops. I was in it during January as well as this month. I’m not spreading FUD but being realistic. They told me to read DDs and that I was wrong, like I’m all for them making money but they need to open their eyes and snap out of delusion when it starts to fall"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Ugh. I'm so tired of this GME roller coaster. I need the squeeze. 

I don't think buying at $300 was a bad move at the time. The price was going to keep going up if they didn't stop people from buying. But now I'm bag holding."

But all of the stuff about GME getting to ""500k"" a share, or even ""1k"" a share, that's nonsense right? Or is that actually at all a possibility?"

03/16/2021,stocks,"GME fell yesterday because an institutional investor wanted out, it seems like not many people are buying it up. It was clear someone wanted to sell a number of shares the market couln't handle and they had to then offload them systematically averaging down. 

Its not going to be gamma squeezed since open interest on calls is extremely low, buuuut I am curious why it traded sideways today, or rather rebounded from a dip in the premarket. It should continuously drop each day. 

i really want to know how many shares WSB retail investors own."
03/16/2021,stocks,"That insane dip last week felt like a warning shot to me and an indicator that retail is in no way in control of this. Got in and out with a small profit on less than a full share. I bought a way OTM put today. Sorry. I was all-in on the first run but it seems like all that's keeping GME up now is hype and a weirdly religious zeal.

03/16/2021,stocks,"Beta is a lagging indicator not a leading one.  If you programmed a smart enough algorithm or had a machine learning one running in January when the spike caused the instability the bastard would probably sell when GME goes up or to buy it when the market goes down.  It being at the price it’s at is not exactly a poster child for rational markets.  

Or a million other more plausible rational theories than a short seller conspiracy on a stock.  The fact that the borrow rate is sub 1% to short should tell you everything you need to know about what short interest is like."

03/16/2021,stocks,AMC is already back at the 2019 price. I think there will be some boom in Cinema but let's not forget pre covid people were predeicting for AMC to crumble under the pressure of streaming services and smaller specialty theaters with better amenities and food. I bought in at 6 bucks sold at 14 but I don't understand where the extra hype comes from. Gamestop was a reaction to shorts is there a melvin equivalent to AMC I don't know about?
03/16/2021,stocks,I exited AMC and bought RKT. Expect many did the same but perhaps people will dump GME for AMC.
03/16/2021,stocks,I am holding with the hope that a lot of stimulus checks will hit tomorrow. Unfortunately I got mine already and bought at $172 yesterday morning...

03/16/2021,stocks,I hope so...
03/16/2021,stocks,Like me. i say that and then end up staring at the ticker all day.
03/16/2021,stocks,"The situation is unique in so many ways, but my guess is that they are hoping it creates a panics sell off.

Wsb might be holding strong, but if anyone got swept to buy in at $200 or hell even like $240 this time around, they might just say ""this is too risky"" and sell and cut losses. This is especially so with people losing big during the first squeeze.

So it's a game of chicken. It's a lot easier to hold when your average cost is $40, than it is when you're at $200, and there's no telling what individual retail investors will do. You might even have ppl who are holding at $300+ from the last time saying.... Okay, I'll sell at a loss now that it's not as significant.

It easy to say, no, this has happened over and over just hold and it'll moon, but the truth is no one knows what tomorrow will bring and that's just enough uncertainty for them to try."
03/16/2021,stocks,"There's no such thing as ladder attacks. The closest thing to that in reality would be ""stop hunting"". When the price is close to a popular stop-loss, institutional traders with short positions might sell shares to push the price down to that level, triggering a mass of stop loss orders and driving the price down further. Then they can buy back some shares and cover part of their short position"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't think that's happening, for disclosure I sold out at 280/300, I think this last wave was investors pushing the price up there was no squeeze and it's a low probability of another one"

A big drop, a recovery to pre liftoff, a weekend, a slow bleed on monday and then a crash on tuesday."

03/16/2021,stocks,"I bought in the 300s the first squeeze and sold at a loss when it crashed. Watching on the sidelines this time. Learned my lesson about buying into hype and buying a meme stock when it's high risk. 

You might be able to count on GME spiking again, but I doubt anyone even expected GME to squeeze a second time beyond gut feelings and people blindly memeing the stock. To anyone that said they expected it the whole time, hindsight is 20/20."
03/16/2021,stocks,Buying at $300 was def a bad move lol look up FOMO and trying not to make that mistake again.

03/16/2021,stocks,"500k is nonsense, but 1k is possible but not probable. 

I'm going to assume you know what a short squeeze is and I will also assume you have heard of a gamma squeeze. I will not explain them here but basically, in order for it to get to 1k people need to buy an absolute Soviet sized shit-ton of call options at itm strike prices and continue to do so as the stock rises. 

Retail investors just do not have the capital to make it happen and a short squeeze is extraordinarily unlikely because orchestrated short squeezes take years and are very difficult, see VW in late 00s, and short interest on GME is only 30% when in January is 140%. 

So no, it won't make it to 1k, it might try, but it will fail."

03/16/2021,stocks,I bought in gme for 150. Could've got in at 88 then purchased a bunch then sold at 348. Then get back in. I couldve made so much. Stimulus is coming tomorrow. I am excited
03/16/2021,stocks,$188 now. At this point you may just want to see what it does at 10:30
03/16/2021,stocks,"Thinking of doing the same, might just hold and see what it does at market open."
03/16/2021,stocks,"depends which brokerage you're at, but you can do pre-market or after close trading. 7-9am or 4-8pm."
03/16/2021,stocks,I love that you didnt mention which stock but I know exactly what you're talking about :)
03/16/2021,stocks,Doubled down again on RKT because of that
03/16/2021,stocks,"Gme is only -4%, am i missing something?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"bet on the big, everything is fine"
03/16/2021,stocks,I wouldn’t call that “mooning”.
03/16/2021,stocks,Well that was short lived
03/16/2021,stocks,thats a buy territory if that happens
03/16/2021,stocks,"I doubt it, but if it happens, it will be the best entry point to the rollercoaster xD"
03/16/2021,stocks,be gone bot
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't understand the appeal of SQQQ. You're basically hoping to time a Bear market, right?"
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm in on the $RSI ride as well.
03/16/2021,stocks,"150 is my entry point.

Edit. Looks like I’m missing  the boat today. this stonk makes no sense and I’m all about it"
03/16/2021,stocks,Then DFV will tweet something and GME will be back up again. I have no skin in this game but it’s a joy to watch and I hope it continues on and on. It’s officially dead when DFV sells off all his shares.
03/16/2021,stocks,Officially dead while it sits over $200 per share and appears to be heavily manipulated. It's far from dead
03/16/2021,stocks,damn right it's dead to me. I paper handed at $118
03/16/2021,stocks,I threw my chips at APHA and TLRY again this morning. Looks prepped for a good run up with the merger confirmation set for next month.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes SEC, this user right here."
03/16/2021,stocks,Castor maritime is tried and old.
03/16/2021,stocks,I believe there is some federal reserve announcement tomorrow.
03/16/2021,stocks,Federal reserve will make a decision about inflation. 2pm.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Agree on the short interest and realize it’s a lagging indicator, but I haven’t read anything that equates volatility to negative beta."
03/16/2021,stocks,FR! Was up a solid $2 and dropped right back down in an hour and it’s stayed there all day.
03/16/2021,stocks,Shit was crazy even more crazy then the drop from Friday
03/16/2021,stocks,Because I’m retarded
03/16/2021,stocks,It's like watching an accident happen that you just can't turn away.
03/16/2021,stocks,it just keeps truckin away... next dip i'll likely grab more.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Definately mate, AMC despite the volatility has value as a covid recovery play, also new traders with stimmies might pump it due to it's low price and high hype.
I sold half of my AMC yesterday for 14$ (bought at 11) and I'm keeping the remaining 10 shares just for the shits and giggles."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Aye stimmy is coming,but retail isn't the biggest player in town, last week showed us that.
It might bounce into high 200's low 300's, might also crash as people will relocate their assets.
I'm willin to bet that the biggest beneficent of stimmy cash inflow is gonna be AMC as it's still hyped and has a lower price entry point."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I doubt it’ll put a dent immediately tomorrow at least. For one, you actually need the transfer from IRS to clear before putting it in your brokerage account, which can take at least 2 days. If they were gonna do instant deposits, they could’ve already done it before the money lands anyways"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Hey, if you don't buy/hold and make lot's of money, someone else will."
03/16/2021,stocks,There are many other companies out there. You don’t have to invest in that one to make money.
03/16/2021,stocks,Who would you rather run the world? The US or China/Russia?
03/16/2021,stocks,"$188 here... averaged down to $180/share before it started taking off for round 2. Made a tiny profit, but honestly I'm just glad to be off that train. Wouldn't be able to stomach it plummeting down to sub-100 again. Many congrats to those still on the rocket if it ever takes off."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah, it was pretty stupid of me to sell so late, but can't do anything about it. Am up over 100% anyways. If it does a third run-up I'll know when to sell. Or at least I hope. Its just very violatile."
03/16/2021,stocks,I am right there with you...
03/16/2021,stocks,Based on your username you might be into that kind of thing
03/16/2021,stocks,It was heavily shorted as well. Just not as heavy as GME
03/16/2021,stocks,"Also market inflation, so everything is expected to be higher than precovid level."
03/16/2021,stocks,Which is crazy cause it's been diluted like hell since then.
03/16/2021,stocks,Im thinking the same thing now the GME has gone main stream and everyone getting their stimmy checks. Im thinking end of the week by the time the money clears people banks and is deposited into what ever venue they use to trade stocks.
03/16/2021,stocks,A lot of speculation that it’ll hit 300+ in a short time frame
03/16/2021,stocks,"It's an expensive lesson to learn, but it sounds like you've learned it."
03/16/2021,stocks,It would be nice if I got a stimulus check... but that damn 160k rule screwed me.
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm swearing meme stocks off for good. I lost two weeks worth of gains just on this one bad trade.
03/16/2021,stocks,You can always buy back in at the next major dip. It's bound to happen. That's my plan. Also felt like I needed to get out at 195 as it was looking like it was about to implode. Really surprised by the turnaround today.
03/16/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/16/2021,stocks,"Options open interest seems incredibly important at this stage. It's just too low for any sort of gamma action at this point, which is what set off the second squeeze more so than shorting (my theory based on DD I've read)."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that was me."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Making me dizzy already today. Buying, selling, I don't know the right move but I am holding. Might even buy a little bit more..."

03/16/2021,stocks,"lest we forget the shenanigans vlad pulled to fuck the shareholders the first go around. we honestly have no idea what would have happened if that bullshit didn’t occur.

DISCLOSURE: i own 1 share of GME for the fuck of it still. sold out the rest at 300 to 350 back in round 1"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I see.

So far GME has given me a little profits (not much because I didn't invest much, under $100 in gains) and as long as it doesn't dip down to ~$170ish again I can still get out having made a profit. I think I'm gonna get out tomorrow, probably leave a few dollars in just in case."
03/16/2021,stocks,"We shouldn't forget that in the first run GME spiked to almost $500 and now in the second run almost $350. So, if there were one or two more squeezes we might total 1k-2k."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If you don't care about good faith violations, sure."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't believe so, haven't dug that deep yet to find out. Regarding the settlement dates, some googling says instant for reinvestment, and some says not. I'm gonna play it safe for now and just sit this game out, holding."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I mean we know some things, but there are some very important outstanding questions that may never be known."
03/16/2021,stocks,I have not seen a single DD on GME that wasn’t complete unsubstantiated amateur nonsense
03/16/2021,stocks,I sold at a 'profit' but still lost money thanks to all the stupid fucking calls I bought.
03/16/2021,stocks,"It's already been dropping all morning >.<

Maybe there'll be a bounce when markets open but yeah, seems over. Should never have gotten greedy lol."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Retail just doesn't have the volume to dramatically influence stock price one way or another.  Peaks and dips are whales at play, the rest of use are just along for the ride."
03/16/2021,stocks,1 person... Jerome Powell
03/16/2021,stocks,Fed announcement on interest rates and inflation forecasts tomorrow. If it’s something unexpected it’s gonna be a very red week
03/16/2021,stocks,Why 10:30 specifically?
03/16/2021,stocks,Mine only lets me go from 8am to 9:25am. I was up watching and dying to sell at like 4:30am lol.
03/16/2021,stocks,"What do you mean?

You mean the stock at $200, 208, 190, 185, 195 or 188?"
03/16/2021,stocks,Not for the people who bought it much higher than that.
03/16/2021,stocks,It went up 5% in like 5 minutes
03/16/2021,stocks,"Fool me once
Fool me twice"
03/16/2021,stocks,Nah I'll be selling my puts for major gainss baby
03/16/2021,stocks,I’m not a bot ffs
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm hoping for it to get back to $15 so I can fucking sell.
03/16/2021,stocks,He tweeted twice yesterday
03/16/2021,stocks,Lol any downward movement=manipulation.
03/16/2021,stocks,"It's been on a consistent downward trend though, what impetus would there be to push it back up? There's not even a theoretical framework for it anymore, unless I missed something?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"And it’s down like what, 40% in the last two days?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Fuck, knew I shouldn’t have thrown $2500 at it"
03/16/2021,stocks,"That’s because functionally it’s not really as rare as people are making it out to be historically.  In some of my financial courses they talked about the strategy of defensive stocks for downturns.  Vice stocks (Tobacco, Alcohol) at points have had negative betas with broad index based off the idea that bad economy means people drink and smoke more.  Same with gold and silver in normal market conditions.

Also take a look at the time period for the calculations as the data in January is going to skew shit significantly since it was causation not correlation at that point."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You are correct, about that."
03/16/2021,stocks,"With CashApp anyone can sign up and buy the same day, and they have GME now. If the stimulus is direct deposited into your bank account you could actually sign up for a new CashApp account and buy GME within a matter of minutes."
03/16/2021,stocks,"That’s a problematic position as well, but a very popular one!"
03/16/2021,stocks,"It’s true. Resistance is futile. If you look at the consistent volume on PLTR, you’ll quickly realize that a single retail investor won’t make a difference in the final outcome. 

That said, it’s morally irresponsible to invest in some of the for-profit prison stocks. My view of Michael Barry is low because of his positions"
03/16/2021,stocks,"if it hits 300, then i'm out and will wait for the dip again. I'd like to believe that its getting ""predictable"" but i've thought that about my marriage also."
03/16/2021,stocks,I believe it.
03/16/2021,stocks,Remindme! 8 hours
03/16/2021,stocks,You can still enjoy riding up with the people who did. Based purely on a feeling I think most GME buyers will qualify for one. I would gladly trade my stimulus for a job that put me over 160k.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Not really. When WSB says ladder attack they mean 2 institutions intentionally trading between each other in rapid succession at progressively lower prices to artificially drive the price down. Which is impossible, since exchanges don't allow buyers and sellers to select each other's orders. 

Also stop hunting only works if the price is already close to a very common stop loss, it can't just be done whenever they want"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Because nobody seems to want to buy anything close to ITM which is needed to pull the price up to hit the OTM numbers, as I understand it what you've got here is a ladder thats missing the first 5 rungs, how the hell can you get to rung 6??"
03/16/2021,stocks,Gl.
03/16/2021,stocks,"All of this squeeze talk is none sense, this right now is mania pure and simple, people buying for the sake of buying. It’s completely unpredictable and it could go higher or lower, but eventually it’ll definitely settle somewhere below or around $50. That’s how all bubbles are"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm not an expert, but I think there may be one more squeeze left to gain from this on the 23 when they have an earnings report, but after that, it's completely toast."
03/16/2021,stocks,"you get out tomorrow after all this time is foolish in my opinion.  The stock is ready to go.  Perfect storm   They are borrowing investment firms and brokers shares which have to be paid back in 2 days (they can stretch until 4)    Either or both they are dropping price so their short interest is lower billions per day and or buying out shorts.  It's like paying down your visa with mastercard.  Stimmys from the Americans tomorrow most of them will cause a price increase, options due Friday along with the 3.5 million shares they borrowed Monday have to be returned.  Top it off Earnings report on Tuesday and all the shares they borrowed today. I heard 5-6 million are due Monday.  Hold it for another week it could be worth it but you never know."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Agreed. We don’t know: 
- Real Short interest 
- What levels HF shorted at? Did they reload their shorts? Did they exit their shorts at $2-20?
- Why did the price shoot up by 400% from $40 on a random Tuesday
- What is the tradeable float
- How much stock does “diamond hand” retail own?

Many other things we don’t know."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Can you link a DD that substantiates your claim that GME does NOT have the potential to go to $1,000+ a share? I mean, even if it did go to $1,000 that's a 500% increase. Genuinely curious. Don't think its fair to call some of the really detailed DD I've read as ""amateur nonsense""."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If you can remember exactly what you just said, you can have lots of success in the stock market for many years. Rule #1 of successful traders: Don't get greedy.

Then again, what do I know? I get greedy way too often. That's probably why I'm not a successful trader!"
03/16/2021,stocks,Usually any big movement on a stock will occur between 9:30 and 10:30. Seems to be the case with something as volatile as GME.
03/16/2021,stocks,"ah, yah, that's some dumbfuckery going on at that hour."
03/16/2021,stocks,I think that next week has a potential for spiking again. Earnings report etc
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think GME is like a masterclass for retail traders. I mean, in two months you can experience first-hand how the whole market works"
03/16/2021,stocks,"...I guess you missed the $150 price drop in 20 minutes triggering multiple halts? I'll let you keep pretending I'm talking about ""any downward movement""."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Whales, RC tweet, Gamestop announcement, Congressional hearing, earnings, new DTCC rule, stimulus volume, etc. Any number of things could set off the volume and the price flies again. Yes, it's been dipping since last Wednesday but there's nothing to support ""it's dead"". Nobody knows what will happen, both squeeze and crash are highly possible.

It's fair to say the company has a good long-term growth opportunity regardless of a squeeze now that Ryan Cohen's behind the wheel."
03/16/2021,stocks,"The new DTCC rule that comes in on friday means that institutions that dont have liquidity to cover their short positions if they get margin called will be forced to close. Citadel have just issued 600 million bonds at $100 each to try to gain liquidity ($60 bn) .

Gamestop bonds expire on thursday too afaik. This catalyst for a small price rise partnered with the dtcc rulings could force any funds without major liquidity to close their positions."
03/16/2021,stocks,up 389% in 20 days?
03/16/2021,stocks,"You can’t cash app out money that hasn’t cleared. The stim checks are still ACH transfers that take 2 business days. Now if you have a setup with the bank that you’re so trusted they let you ACH out money that hasn’t cleared, and money you otherwise don’t have in your account, you might pull it off but no bank I know let’s you do that. Letting you empty your account sending money that hasn’t cleared is insanely risky"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Let me tell you.. Its never enough. Seriously, the more money you have the more you spend. I never thought that as a kid but its SO true. Wife, 3 kids, house, mortgage, 2 cars, private schools..... eh. Never get married i suppose.

But 100% wish for you to go way beyond 160K a year. I hope you make 1M+ a year some day.

i'll also say.. that yea. I dont need the stimulus. I would have put it right into something frivolous anyway. I kinda agree with the 160k limit. Now if they took the stimmy that i could have gotten and increased the stim for the people that really needed it... now thats a solid plan. No politics!"
03/16/2021,stocks,">Not really. When WSB says ladder attack they mean 2 institutions intentionally trading between each other in rapid succession at progressively lower prices to artificially drive the price down. Which is impossible, since exchanges don't allow buyers and sellers to select each other's orders.

I’ve always wondered the legitimacy of them saying that. It didn’t seem possible. So it’s misinformation isn’t it.. where did that even come about.."
03/16/2021,stocks,"yep I agree. I don't think anyone really understands what is going to happen, but after rising from the ashes as a bagholder, this morning I was getting similar vibes to when it ran out of steam in January, and had to exit. I'll probably FOMO buy back in if the opportunity presents itself... but only at a reasonable price. Just a few weeks ago when it hit 190, that seemed insane."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I do believe this is the final one that will burst the bubble.  Too deep of a hole now.  Earnings looks to be 1.37 up from predicted 1.25 estimate.  so much going on.  They are trying to hide their borrowing through brokers and investment firms, options, stimmys and earnings oh my!!!   Like life no guarantee"
03/16/2021,stocks,"All bag holders think there's one more squeeze left.  If anything, earning report will show people that this is still a money losing business.  Additionally, insiders should be allowed to sell after earnings report since they no longer have insider knowledge about earnings.  That should cause some downward pressure on the stock price."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I do want to say two possible answers: 

Short interest is likely 30%, I've some Forbes/CNBC types advocate this, I can maybe find a source if ya want

It went up on a Tuesday cause Ryan Cohen took over as CEO and it legit traded upward on news, BUT then got Gamma Squeezed by the insane amounts of call option buying pressure."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Uh literally everything about how stock market works goes is my DD? I can’t post proof that an insane unheard of thing that everyone is claiming is going to happen based on shitty research is not gonna happen, what am I gonna do post every single common wisdom and known rules of the stock market one by one?

GME going to 1,000 is an extraordinary claim, the burden of proof is on whoever is saying that it does. It not going to the moon is standard and normal, the burden of proof for something behaving normally is not on me. 

Regardless, I stand by what I said, If you post the DDs that claim it’s gonna moon to $1000 or whatever, I’ll happily point out why/where/how they’re wrong. 

Also side note, just because something is detailed and took a ton of work, doesn’t mean it’s correct. Like that one idiot who set up excel sheets and did ton of work on short interest without realizing that short volume != increase in short interest and came up with like 900% short interest."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Gotcha. Feels like things tend to drop after 10:30 though, and I don't want to risk things going even more south, so I guess I'll try to get out during the hour. Thanks."
03/16/2021,stocks,Fool me chicken soup with rice
03/16/2021,stocks,Earnings are going to tank the stock. Are you delusional?
03/16/2021,stocks,First hand gains
03/16/2021,stocks,"It’s the most volatile stock in recent memory that’s not a penny (penny stocks do this shit all the time.) People have been warning about sudden drops like that since this started. A massive sell triggering stops and profit taking isn’t manipulation unless you consider them moving the price up for 2 weeks straight manipulation as well. The whole thing was triggered by a massive buy in late feb that created a bunch of smaller gamma squeezes. It was bound to start cracking at some point since it didn’t have the solid foundation of the first run. I think if it takes a big shit back under $200 today it will rebound tomorrow into the weekend, so I’m not foolish enough to believe  it’s over, but the tinfoil industry has to be making a killing over the past few months."
03/16/2021,stocks,"This seems like kind of a stretch. If the price is remotely close to the fundamental value I would see a chance, but as it is it seems the rational thing to do is to cut your losses and move on.

I admit i was an idiot and should've kept to gambling 1 stock at a time."
03/16/2021,stocks,You don’t think they knew about this ahead of time?
03/16/2021,stocks,Lol and? The party’s now over. It’s coming back to $40s or $30s. I’d reason by thursday at the latest.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah I assumed we meant after it's cleared, available to use.

As an aside, every bank I've used does offer 'overdraft protection' to pretty much anyone who can open an account in the first place, in which case if they see the deposit in their account and are okay with an overdraft fee, they could just overdraft themselves to do it, no need to have that sort of relationship with their bank."
03/16/2021,stocks,"> Seriously, the more money you have the more you spend.

Not if you want to be wealthy. 

I'm a pauper myself, but read The Millionaire Next Door. It's basically written for high income earners who are high spenders."
03/16/2021,stocks,I used to make that and you are 100% right. Actually less pressure having less money.
03/16/2021,stocks,You seem like a good person.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Literally everything coming from wsb regarding meme stocks is misinformation, just pure ignorance and confirmation bias. Blind leading the blind, people who entered the market for 2 weeks and googled some shit and now speak as authority. There was a top post on wsb where the guy calculated like 900%+ short interest for gme because he didn’t understand short volume does not mean absolute number of shares sold short (aka short interest), which is hilariously incorrect and people were repeating it. comments pointing that out that it was wrong were nowhere near the top, at least when I checked. 

It’s a very common pattern, clueless people finding something incorrect, pushing it on other clueless people, call voices of reason shills, rinse repeat."
03/16/2021,stocks,"There's a Seeking Alpha article from a few years ago called ""Anatomy of a Short Attack"" which describes a process of flooding the ask side of the order book to push the price down (the author describes institutions bribing traders to sell their shares or something like that) It's definitely what inspired the concept of short ladder attacks. But the article also talks about something the author made up called ""counterfeit shares"" (his description of this is NOT naked shorting, which is often referred to as counterfeiting) and provides examples that don't really make sense"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Seems entirely possible to me with 2 large willing participants doing it. Though unlikely that it happened this time around, I think this one was investors pushing the price up not events triggering anything"
03/16/2021,stocks,exact same with me. What do you think is a FOMO buy in price for you?
03/16/2021,stocks,"I dunno. Even if the company's financials are shit, they got a new ceo and they will 100% talk about restructuring. I think that might be enough to swing the stock upward, and if there is enough call option buying pressure, it may get gamma'd again. 

I think the problem will be the ungodly cost of the options, $1-200 an option is manageable, and then OTM options will be like 20 bucks, so you can get open interest from retailers at various necessary levels to continue the squeeze up, but when itm call options cost in the thousands, its much less likely.

I think th thesis of WSB is sound, the problem is retailers can no longer afford it."
03/16/2021,stocks,"no one cares if it is a money losing business.  Earnings estimate is up 1.37 from 1.25.

There are more 800c open for Friday that for next Friday at all strikes combined by a decent margin and next week includes earnings.  There isn’t another week with significant open interest until April monthly expiry and even then it’s fractional compared to what expires Friday.
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah but the fact that you can borrow shares for less than a 1% in borrow cost and they are plentiful supports the argument that short interest is low.  You could in theory fake the finra numbers and eat the fine but artificially keeping the borrow cost low would require all the brokers to give up potential income which cannot be explained away rationally.

The day it had the flash crash it ran up 50% before lunch. At some point movement like that, with no real catalyst, is going to see a massive pullback, possibly from firms seeing $350 as a good entry point for a short position, but I’m sure there was also quite a lot of profit taking, stop limits triggering, and selling to break even from people not wanting to get burned like last time. If you bought at $40 and sold at $200 or more you did pretty fucking well for yourself.

I made the mistake of buying solar stocks on margin right before the collapse.  I had pulled out before the bottom with the plan of buying back in at a lower cost.  However, I wasn't able to buy anything on margin once the market actually did hit the supposed bottom.  The only margin I've been able to use is trading with unsettled funds, but the value of my stocks are not exceeding the value of funds I invested in the account.

I have $5K in the account with another $1.3K recently deposited and in the process of settling.  When buying back at the bottom I did not buy all of my equities back evenly.

Understanding how charts work is not debatable.  It is very essential for investors to see how a company, and/or market is behaving.  If an investor is not reading charts, then how would they know if they buying at ATHs or not?  How would they know of there was a major sell off? They would be wondering why they lost so much on their investment when a dip happens; which usually leaves them feeling discouraged.

Experienced traders use charts all the time, which is why they offer tools to use on charts to get a better understanding of what is happening.  There are many different chart terms for a reason; so that's my opinion on it."

What you're describing is valuation, not reading charts. Buying at ATH is a perfectly justifiable action in plenty of cases, depending on plenty of circumstances that have nothing to do with charts. If there's a sell-off, it doesn't change whether or not a company is a good investment.

A change that's already happening with more services like Uber, less ownership of cars and young people getting their licences, more renting and paying for services vs owning.  That plays into the change to automobiles and commuting.  Tesla plans on implementing fleets of autonomous taxi services.  However; if you bet against this change by investing in the companies which are lagging this change, you still will probably come out ahead because all those companies will be forced to adapt as well if they want to survive.

I feel like this is one of those things where the last 5% of the necessary development takes like 80% of the effort. 

Glorified lane assist is easy. Navigating rush hour traffic in a downtown area in inclement weather is orders of magnitude more difficult. 

And, in regards to that last point, I still don't know why corporations haven't pushed for fully autonomous highway driving (in clear weather) as a first step; and then incrementally push for more functionality from there.

Will you pay for the damage arising from this small imperfection? Such as dead people, damages to property etc. It needs to be demonstrably perfect to be officially self-driving.

Point1: No human being drives legally because perfectly legal driving and actually getting from point A to point B reliably do not intersect, especially not in 3rd world countries, country roads, etc. 

Point2: An individual breaks the rules and we brush it off as an error/exception. But autonomous cars (at least within a brand) are expected to be equally perfect and deterministically so. So each error of each one will become a PR nightmare for all of them.

Point 3: political pressure can kill anything.

03/16/2021,stocks,"Just curious on how you think a clear weather restriction on highways only would work?  It would be hard to define clear weather and then weather is constantly changing.  Also someone would already have to drive them onto the highway.  There is already driving assist which is as close to what you are asking for as you are going to get.  I guess the difference being the driver could nap or read a book on the highway?  The real application is things like taxis or  trucks where you wouldn't have a driver at all.  This would mean highway only wouldn't be that useful and which is why no one is pushing it.  As far as the weather part what happens when it changes and you have a taxi or truck that just has to pull over and wait for hours/days possibly?  

I honestly think the biggest problem is going to be the legislation to make it legal in enough places.  The next one is liability.  If there is an accident who is liable the makers of the driving software or the owner of the car?  to me these are the big hurdles that are probably why we are going to have to wait 10 or more years before it is big enough to make a big impact"

03/16/2021,stocks,Totally is. This is 4 years ago https://vimeo.com/192179726
03/16/2021,stocks,"Will point 3 is very valid. The Google polestar drove exponentially farther than the average trucker, and only received one traffic violation... Driving to slowly... Granted it is old, but mildñy humorous. 

https://www.cnn.com/2015/11/13/us/google-self-driving-car-pulled-over


The political problem i see is when the inevitable does happen and a self driving car wrecks.... Who is held liable?"
03/16/2021,stocks,">Just curious on how you think a clear weather restriction on highways only would work?

The car's self driving system would determine that. Either visibility is good and the system allows you to engage self driving or not.

>Also someone would already have to drive them onto the highway...I guess the difference being the driver could nap or read a book on the highway?

Exactly this. Truckers aren't limited by 8 hour shifts. Commuters and travelers don't have to waste bandwidth on tedious highway driving. 

>There is already driving assist which is as close to what you are asking for as you are going to get.

Yes, but none of them are legal to use as a standalone service. I don't know why companies think that they'll just get regulators to buy in to city driving. Easy highway driving should've always been the first step. Like you said, we're basically already there. Why not make it official? 

>The real application is things like taxis or trucks where you wouldn't have a driver at all.

I realize this is the end goal. But see my point above about the final 5% of the functionality will take the majority of the effort. And again, you won't get regulators to buy in to unleashing fsd without restrictions. So incrementally proof testing will be done anyways most likely. 

>As far as the weather part what happens when it changes and you have a taxi or truck that just has to pull over and wait for hours/days possibly? 

Or a human takes over? I just don't understand how you guys can think we'll get buy in from regulators on just getting rid of drivers right off the bat.

>I honestly think the biggest problem is going to be the legislation to make it legal

This is exactly it. And why should they? This isn't the wild west, and the onus should be on the manufacturers to prove that their systems are safe."

2021-03-16 09:33:50,stocks,"International robo and brokerage suggestions Hi everyone,

I’m working with a large group of international performing artists that I’m helping to start investing, and I could use some suggestions for robo-investment and brokerages. In starting them, my goal is to direct them toward long-term, solid plays so they can set and forget beyond a relatively useless savings account, while allowing some wiggle room for those who want to play around with riskier investments.

What options would you recommend for the US, UK, Australia, Japan and South Africa? 

Personally, I’m in with Wealthfront and Etrade, but I’m always open to better ideas, and most folks wouldn’t be able to use those platforms in their home countries.

Thanks for your thoughts in advance.

EDIT: Add Ireland to that list 🇮🇪"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Hey man. I think that is a good idea.

For Stocks I would suggest to invest ETFs if it is about set and forget. This way they get their diversification alone and have the lowest risk. The standard is to invest 80 percent into the msci world etf and 30 percent into the emerging market etf which has a bit more risk but also a higher growth probability to it.

For brokers i can only suggest what to pick in europe. Trade Republic is the cheapest one and offers to invest in etfs without paying the order cost. Also this order cost is the lowest one in Europe (1 Euro) and no other costs exist.

If you use this link here people will start with 15 Euro in their trade account and i as a poor student will get 15 Euros as well. Maybe you have some european artists who are interested.

The Link: https://ref.trade.re/5h0z6dvt

Good luck with your idea!"

Would selling some shares that same day I purchased the 10 shares mark me as a pattern day trader? 

Essentially, does the T+2 rule apply to just the new shares I purchase or all of the new and old shares I own for that company. 

I've tried researching this on my own and the closest thing I could find was the first in first out rule."

I bought MDMP at .30 and sold it within hours at .80 and haven't gotten any notifications or anything. But I also made sure to transfer in another bit of money just in case. I believe if I didn't - it would have counted as a ""Freeriding Violation""

When I looked it up, Fidelity had a whole article on it. So I've been trying to keep a bit of money on hand. Fortunately it seems my bank transfers have been clearing within a day.

03/16/2021,stocks,Thank you. Appreciate you.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I read that article and it didn't cover any similar scenario specific to what I'm trying to ask...basically if I sell, does my broker know to sell my oldest shares and not my newest shares?  Basically first in first out?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Youre seriously overthinking it lol

You can't sell shares from the ""lot"" that is not settled.

As long as you only sell an amount not including newly purchased shares still within the T+2 period you will not incur any free ride day trade violations. 

Plus if you do make a mistake once, most brokers will give you a warning message letting you know you're about to sell unsettled shares and incur a violation. If you only do it once, they usually wont issue the 90 day penalty. You can also call them direct to ask/confirm or explain your mistake and they'll understand."
03/16/2021,stocks,"On both of the trading platforms I'm on, you can select which lots you want to close.   I know this is valid for tax purposes, and I would imagine it also applies to day trading.

You also can day trade 3 days a week without getting marked as a day trader and most platforms provide a 'day trades remaining' counter so you might want to just do a sample trade.

Of course if you don't have a margin account none of this applies, and then you have to deal with things like a free-riding violation if you ever use unsettled funds to buy stock you quickly sell."
03/16/2021,stocks,See but I'm paranoid they will be hard asses and find any excuse to restrict my account. But that wouldn't make sense because they'd want you to sell.  I'm going to bed. Thank you for the explanation.

The company I worked for actually blew up with covid. Tons of deep sanitation cleans that were pretty cheap all around to carry out, on top of huge profits because covid was so new, so what do you set your prices at? Pretty much whatever you want, but always high. They were taking jobs out of state, for movie sets, etc. 

On top of that, the company was still doing their normal office contracts, some contracts just got trimmed for less frequent cleans. 

Basically I don’t think they will be a comeback play, but this is just my example I thought was worth sharing. Admittedly I don’t even know a single janitorial company ticker or how much share prices dropped once covid hit, so maybe there is potential for a comeback."

XPEL, ppf wraps for nice cars is popular and this company is a small company. The techs that wrap the car prefer this brand because it’s easier to manipulate and wrap, thus saving time. In this niche business saving time and scaling labor is where the profit is so a lot of businesses prefer to use this manufacturer. The last earnings call, the ceo was pushing for 60% yoy sales growth and a 38%+ gross margin. That’s a gross margin higher than apple and uhhh growth of a SaaS tech company. The fuck? Idk 🤷🏻‍♂️.

Now I don't think it will be a KIRK story where they basically reach a new ATH right after being priced for bancruptcy, but could I see them go 5x? 10x? Absolutely.

Either way, I believe that we are at an inflection point with birth rates. On a macro-level, economic output is heavily coupled with the birth rate, as is the education level of women. We are now in a place with high unemployment among both sexes and high education rates among women = less and less babies are going to be born. No post-COVID orgies are gonna change that.

2021-03-16 09:00:11,stocks,"$AREC - 72% SI Hello everyone. I’ve recently been doing some DD on different sectors that have been moving slower upwards after these horrific last 2-3 weeks. Something that caught my eye has been AREC which is a rare earth mineral company. As this sector inches upward slowly, this stock has potential to blow with a 72% short interest. I’m not saying it DEFINITELY will happen, but the risk/return in this scenario is definitely worth it. If anyone has anymore information regarding this please do not hesitate to reach me."

2021-03-16 08:34:09,stocks,"Dividend stocks (or, what to do with $300k) Hey all,

Like many, it's been a decent year for me in the markets, and now I'm sitting on about $300,000 in cash post taxes. I have literally never touched traditional stock markets, mostly focusing on other things, but it's getting all so tiresome, so I've de-risked quite a bit.

Upon seeking advice on dividend yields, I was advised I should start funneling money into AT&T over the next year for the 7% dividend. Seems like solid advice, but curious as to the hive-minds thoughts on splitting this into 3x $100K chunks for a long term growth investment.

Shill me your best divvy growers?"
03/16/2021,stocks,Growth and high dividends don't normally fit well in the same sentence.  Value and high dividends do.  So you need to better define what you are trying to accomplish.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Great advice about getting into AT&T (T).

&#x200B;

I currently have $294,362 in AT&T and along with the 7% ($0.52) dividend I sell ""Covered Calls"" quarterly against the stock to gain an additional $0.48. So $1 /$30 is 3.33% income quarterly or 13.33% annually."

03/16/2021,stocks,T has made terrible acquisitions. A ton of goodwill and debt on the books. Never reach for yield.

And SLG is paying just under 5% but was paying 13% because the price had dropped so low.  Also own ARR another REIT.  The REITS have special tax treatment.  OXY is paying a penny a share per Q.  I own 1000's of shares.  I bought a boat load under $9.  They used to pay $.79 per Q per share.  I am hoping this Q or next they raise to $.03-.05 per Q and eventually to $.20.

Still focusing on dividend yield there's also VTV(large cap value) & VPU( utilities). 

Personally I believe VTI is particularly good right now because the S&P500 (VOO) didnt get hit as hard as small and mid caps which are still far from fully recovered. So slightly more well diversified gains can be made in VTI right now."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It wouldn’t appear you understand dividend irrelevance theory. 

The problem with dividends is they don’t really add extra value. While they’re important to your overall returns, they don’t add anything. 

People sell dividend investing like this:

Share price $100

Dividend $10 

Total return $110 

That isn’t the case. On the ex date the share price drops by the same amount of the dividend. Take Costco’s spcial dividend. On December 10th (I believe) Costco’s share price dropped $10 on the opening. So dividend look more like this 

Before dividend share price  $100 

Dividend $10

After Ex date $90 

Return After reinvesting dividends $100 (ofc you’ll have to pay taxes on the dividend)

Some financials also very attractive dividends while maintaining growth prospects. ISBC has been on fire lately and also pays out 4%. JPM pays close to 3%.

03/16/2021,stocks,"Doesn't matter if yields go down in the future unless you're dollar cost averaging or the dividends are so large that reinvestment risk becomes a concern.

The market price of the stock doesn't matter unless you plan to sell."
03/16/2021,stocks,Thanks for your iunput. what's the case for a bond index?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Dividend irrelevance theory is itself irrelevant.

What does a stable company do after it pays a dividend?

It ideally turns more profit and the cash reserve is filled once more to pay the next dividend. The assets don't really change that much by the following quarter assuming the business does virtually nothing. In an ""efficient market"" (efficient market hypothesis is a lie by the way) what happens then?

The share price goes back up.

What happens when you reinvest the dividend in the same security after it is deducted from the share price?

Well I guess you just bought fractional shares at a slight discount then. Which increases your yield on cost even after considering taxes. 15% of a dollar is $0.15 and you wouldn't even pay that if it's in a Roth. (bit of a miss here on my end as the day you receive the dividend and when it is deducted from the share price are different days, but still to my point the price could easily be long recovered)

In addition; dividends are the most honest way companies return value to shareholders, but I'd suggest everybody look into it themselves and make up their own mind about the whole thing as it once was one of the most fanatical debates in finance. Plenty of zealots on both sides. You can probably guess which side I'm on."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't. TBH, I don't understand any of this and I'm just getting my feet wet.

This chunk is largely a ""I don't want the cash to burn away in my savings account"" and will only be about 15% of my portfolio. It'd something I want to let sit for 5-10 years and be able to chew off later. That's what I'm after."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think that this may be a bit too far “zoomed in”. This idea is particularly useful for considering time frames around the dividend date, for example the day before and after. However, once the dividend is distributed and the stock drops, investors aren’t going to already be “pricing in” the next dividend months away. That would be ridiculous. The price gradually experienced buying pressure over time to raise it back up by the dividend amount, and then it drops once again. The point is, dividends are giving you cash in addition to your shares and to say that that is no different than not having the cash is a bit absurd in the long run. Sure, you have to factor in the fact that a company like AT&T doesn’t grow as fast as non-dividend companies, but at this point you aren’t even advising OP properly by telling him to stick it in an index and call it good."
03/16/2021,stocks,"In a simple theory it works like this, but you will find in the markets stocks that pay a dividend aren't flat and often recover the difference and they're more closely pegged to market sentiment (and note, when I think dividend stocks I don't mean stocks that pay absurd dividends and are destined to go bankrupt, I mean stocks like AT&T, VZ, MSFT, AAPL). If the idea that the dividend eroded value from the principle over time then my stocks, like the REITs, would be a fraction of what they were when I bought. In reality, they're all up.

The blue chips that pay decent dividends - like 3-7% are not growth stocks so I wouldn't expect 100% gains from them yoy, but growth stocks don't generally pay dividends either and growth stocks can lose value quickly (TSLA e.g.). Those blue chip dividend stocks are boring and slow, but they don't drop 50% in value over some random tweet in the middle of the night neither.

The COST example is due to the special dividend they offer every few years and if you zoom out you will see COST grew around 30% in 6 months, along with a lot of the market. If you bought COST in 2018, you'd be up about 100% when that special dividend was announced as well as getting 7 dividends and 1 special dividend.

People keep talking about index funds instead, but etfs also invest in dividend stocks and pay dividends. So I don't quite see the argument in favor if just looking at it from the dividend perspective, not to mention the etf fees. The only benefit is less exposure to individual stocks.

03/16/2021,stocks,"not every stock drops after payment of dividends. 

cherrypicking one moment in time of one stock dropping when dividends were paid is not really a strong argument at all.   
I have reit stocks that pay monthly, and they pay out about 10% in dividend yield / year. yet their stock price was more or less stable , or even increased by 10% ever since I got into them.   


most high yield dividend stocks can afford to pay dividends, simply because their business model allows stable profits and returns, thus they are able to pay them. (dividends reduce net profit). 

hence they have less money to reinvest and in most cases, to grow significantly. 

yet there are companies, that offer a stable or even growing dividend, yet can still be considered growth stocks, at least in the current financial and ecomomic situation.

oil companies are one example. covid drop for almost all of them. extremely handsome dividends. yet stock prices are all creeping up back to normal."

check out the options chain. the weekly calls for T aren't that great. you get a much higher premium on longer calls (and when i say ""higher, i don't mean raw numbers, i mean weekly average so if a weekly call would give you 2 cents but a monthly call gives 16 cents, you're getting double the profit on the monthly assuming it doesn't hit).

basically it comes down to how confident you are that the price will stay flat. if you think the price will go up, you can do weeklies and keep increasing the strike every week as the price goes up. if you think it will be flat, you can do a longer term call with a better average premium.

also, for some brokerages commissions might be a factor. everyplace at this point is free trades for buying selling stocks, but at some places they still charge a small fee for options."

presumably he's selling them for a profit, so the only downside is simply that if the company started losing a ton of value tomorrow, he'd have to wait for his calls to expire or buy back the calls he sold before he could sell the shares.

other than that, it's pretty straight forward.

1. he sells the calls and collects the premium
2. time passes and the call either hits and he sells at a profit, or doesn't hit and expires worthless (so he repeats the process).

&#x200B;

I sell the covered calls once a quarter. I do this on the day that the dividend is paid (or a few days after). So on or a short time after the dividend is paid I purchase more AT&T stock (with the dividend income) then sell the covered calls with a strike price at least $1.50 higher than the current (or purchased) price.

So far I have been doing this 1+ quarters. This quarter on Feb 1st when the dividend was paid I purchased more AT&T stock at $28.79 and then sold the April 16th $31 call for a premium of $0.49 ($0.483 net) on the 9800 shares I currently own.

&#x200B;

The only downside (and it really isn't that much) is that I get assigned on the ex-dividend date and miss that dividend and am now out the stock. If this does happen I still get the gains as the stock is sold at $31 (at least a gain $1.50 ) and keep the $0.49 call premium."

> The point is, dividends are giving you cash in addition to your shares and to say that that is no different than not having the cash is a bit absurd in the long run. 

I don’t think you understand. Dividend irrelevance states that selling shares and receiving a dividend is fundamentally the same thing. You can read Buffett’s 2012 letter to shareholders about it. 

> “We’ll start by assuming that you and I are the equal owners of a business with $2 million of net worth. The business earns 12% on tangible net worth – $240,000 – and can reasonably expect to earn the same 12% on reinvested earnings. Furthermore, there are outsiders who always wish to buy into our business at 125% of net worth. Therefore, the value of what we each own is now $1.25 million. You would like to have the two of us shareholders receive one-third of our company’s annual earnings and have two-thirds be reinvested. That plan, you feel, will nicely balance your needs for both current income and capital growth. So you suggest that we pay out $80,000 of current earnings and retain $160,000 to increase the future earnings of the business. In the first year, your dividend would be $40,000, and as earnings grew and the one- third payout was maintained, so too would your dividend. In total, dividends and stock value would increase 8% each year (12% earned on net worth less 4% of net worth paid out).” -The Old Man Himself

Companies like TSLA have reinvestment opportunities compared to the boring blue chip companies. If TSLA didn’t know what to do with the extra cash, then share buybacks or a dividend would be needed. I don’t quite understand what you’re getting at in this part. 

> The COST example is due to the special dividend they offer every few years and if you zoom out you will see COST grew around 30% in 6 months, along with a lot of the market. If you bought COST in 2018, you'd be up about 100% when that special dividend was announced as well as getting 7 dividends and 1 special dividend.

Right...market forces don’t cease because of an ex-dividend date. 

Imagine if you had $100 in stock X. Stock X plays a dividend of $1. On the ex date your investment is now worth $99. Market forces “recovers” the stock back to $100 and then you get the $1 dividend. You now have $101. 

Imagine if you had $100 in stock Y. Stock Y is basically the same company as stock x, but stock Y doesn’t pay a dividend. Your investment is worth $100 Market forces act and pushes the stock to to $101. You now have $101. 

> People keep talking about index funds instead, but etfs also invest in dividend stocks and pay dividends.

I am staring down retirement dude and have been investing for decades. Before I left my company as a C exec I was in a high tax bracket. I would gladly pay 15% in taxes instead of 30+ I had been paying before. You're going to get taxed no matter what. Taking capital gains and dividends taxes are less than what you pay taking a salary.

03/16/2021,stocks,"> New to learning how this works. I have some T stock long term and wondered if there is any value to adding a covered call to it. So if you have a target of $35 how much are you usually making? Thank you

for starters, since you said you're learning i want to make sure you're aware that calls work in multiples of 100 (so to do 1 covered call, you need 100 shares).

right now, the premiums (and these are per share, so multiply it by 100 to see what you'd actually get) at a $35 strike for various expiration dates are:

* 3/19: $0.00
* 3/26: $0.01
* 4/1: $0.01
* 4/9: $0.01
* 4/16: $0.03
* 4/23: $0.03
* 4/30: $0.04

(skipping a few weeks here and looking at 3-4 months since someone had suggested quarterly, you have 7/16 at $0.19)

at that point, you have 4 choices

1. do nothing
2. take the monthly call for 4/16 since it's basically free money, and if you can average comparable returns every month you're adding 36 cents per share worth of premiums to your $2.08 annual  dividend payouts, which is effectively like getting 20% more return
3. you can take the longer time period since 19 cents spread over 17 weeks is a slightly higher return than 3 cents over 4 weeks
4. you can look at the other strike prices and find something a little bit lower than you're comfortable with that has a higher premium (like maybe instead of doing $35, you do $34 where you can get $0.05 for 4/23)

the idea is basically that it's free money if the calls expire worthless, and if you didn't do the calls the shares would have just been sitting there doing nothing. it might not be big money per share, but the more shares you have the more money you're seeing coming in.

if you're getting 3 cents per share every month, and you have 900 shares, that's an extra $324 at the end of the year. you can use that to buy more shares."

You receive the dividend regardless if you need the money or not. Then you’ll pay taxes on the dividend. You don’t sell shares unless you need the money, right? You receive a monthly, quarterly, or yearly dividend regardless weather or not you need the money. 

I think this is where you’re not understanding what I/Warren Buffett/The Academics are putting down. Selling shares is the same as receiving a dividend. 

This is why dividend investing is rather pointless, if not snake oil.

Before taxes, tradings fees, ect; there is no basis to prefer dividend stocks over non dividend stocks.

I just don't see the logic in that. A common example I've read about it kinda tells the same story but it falls down to taxes. But here is where I find the flaw -

The logic I see is with selling you pay taxes on the gains. Which I understand. But after you hold any kind of asset for an extended period of time your gains will far out pace your cost basis. So instead of paying taxes on 100%, you would be paying taxes on 90% when you sell. Which is less, but then you are also reducing your holding."

> I just don't see the logic in that. A common example I've read about it kinda tells the same story but it falls down to taxes. But here is where I find the flaw -


Ok. For simplicity sake let’s say companies trade at book value. Have the same profitability, revenue, growth rate ect. Everything is the same. 

Let’s say both companies have a share price of $10 a share. Company 1 pays a $1 dividend, while Company 2 pays no dividend. 

You own 10,000 shares of company 1, and you receive $10,000 in dividends. On the Ex-Date your share’s value drop by $1 to $9 per share, so now your portfolio is worth $90,000 in stock and $10,000 in cash before taxes. 

I own 10,000 shares of company 2. I decided I need $10,000 so I sell 1,000 shares. Now my portfolio is worth $90,000 in stock and $10,000 in cash before taxes. 

We both end up in the same place in this scenario...However I chose to create my own dividend, while you didn’t. So let’s do another example where I decided not to sell shares and factor in company growth. 

You own 10,000 shares of company 1, and you receive $10,000 in dividends. On the Ex-Date your share’s value drop by $1 to $9 per share. Your share price appreciated by $1 (now it’s back at $10 a share) between the ex and payment date, so now your portfolio is worth $100,000 in stock and $10,000 in cash before taxes. 

I own 10,000 shares of company 2. Since our companies grow at the same rate, my share price also grows to $11. Now my portfolio is worth $110,000 in stock. I have no tax liability. 

For you to come out ahead of me, you’d either have to change the ratios at which your company is traded at, or eliminate taxes. 

Here’s a non stock related example that may help, it’s not a perfect example but hopefully it’ll make more sense: 

Say you have a $100 Bill. I have 5 $20s. Before we exchange money, my cousin runs up and asks for $20 and I give it to him. Are you going to exchange your $100 for my $80? 

In this example, you’d be someone buying a stock or a stock analyst, I’d be a company, and my cousin is a shareholder getting his $20 dividend from me. This is why people say “before taxes and fees....so long as $1=$1, then there is no basis to prefer dividends over selling shares.” 

The reason why this is hard to visualize is because no two companies are exactly the same. This makes it easy to assume this phenomenon is non existent because you cannot see our company example above. But what you can see is how analysts drop the share price by the amount of the dividend on the ex-date because they know “so long as $1=$1 then the company devalued itself by the amount of the dividend.” Which then I go back to the Costco special dividend example last year.

03/16/2021,stocks,"> Buffett thinks he can reinvest the cash better than what his shareholders can do with it.

Buffet is Buffet. It would be great if we could all gobble up companies and make big moves like him. He's very wise and also came from a booming generation that was much different than todays economy.

I get the example you used, its used often in explaining dividend vs non-dividend. My point though, from the original argument is it's too simplistic, and taxes is often what is used to argue the cons of dividends. That you can sell shares and you only get taxed on the gains, rather than taxed on 100% of the dividend.

What I was trying to get at is if this is an investment portfolio you're building for retirement and you chose a stock for growth and no dividends, its likely your average cost is low as you held it for years. Using AAPL and (forget the dividend for now) accounting for splits, the cost per share on Jan 1, 2010 would be around $7.50. Now if you sold today (round to 125.00 a share), you would be taxed long terms capital gains on 117.50 per share, but you are reducing your portfolio every time you sell. It's the part of chipping away at what generates income is the part I am trying to highlight. If you built up enough for the dividends to generate income you are taxed long term capital gains on 100% of the income but you are not reducing your portfolio every time you sell. 

Also I don't encourage people to be 100% of all their investments into dividends, I don't think they're bad long term and in most cases people end up taking dividends anyways because most people buy ETFs / Mutual Funds or some other kind of % generating income."
03/16/2021,stocks,"> It's fine for intelligent people to disagree. 

I’m sorry but no. There are intelligent people that think the earth is flat or that birds are actually robot spies. 

Like I said. For you to disprove dividend irrelevancy, you’d have to prove that x doesn’t equal x. Which would then break math as we know it. 

So as long as you know/believe/trust math, dividends are irrelevant."
03/16/2021,stocks,"> That you can sell shares and you only get taxed on the gains, rather than taxed on 100% of the dividend.

I’m not tracking. You can make your own dividend by selling shares when you need the money, whereas if you buy a company that pays dividends you get the dividend if you need it or not which leads to taxes. 

Imagine if I told you to sell off 4% of your portfolio per year, regardless if you needed the money. This would be dumb. This would be dividends. 

> but you are reducing your portfolio every time you sell. 

And you reduce your portfolio every time you receive a dividend too. Remember our example? 


> It's the part of chipping away at what generates income is the part I am trying to highlight. If you built up enough for the dividends to generate income you are taxed long term capital gains on 100% of the income but you are not reducing your portfolio every time you sell.

You are reducing it every time you receive a dividend. On the Ex date the share prices/company value goes down. Remember our example? 

> Also I don't encourage people to be 100% of all their investments into dividends, 

Investing in a company because it has a dividend isn’t smart nor logical. 

Investing in a solid company because it’s a good company, and the company happens to have a dividend too...is good.

Edit: 

At the end of the day you can own 100% of $90,000 or you can own 90% of $100,000. As the investor you’re in the same place, your total portfolio is $90,000 in stock and $10,000 in cash. Dividend irrelevancy."

IE can you  buy 65 pizzas instead of all 100 @ $10 each if that's all you can afford? I know there is a premium you pay per stock so is it actually more like $10 + premium/share x stock qty?"

03/16/2021,stocks,"“You are not obligated to buy but most people do”

Most people don’t buy they sell the option.  Less than 10% of options actually get exercised into actual purchase of shares.

2021-03-16 08:29:00,stocks,"How big should my portfolio be before I can quit my job? So I’ve been heavily building my portfolio for a while now and I have to ask this question here, because I can’t seem to find answers on google.
If I type this into google, I only get results like “You need this much to retire” and they don’t even take index funds into account.

So if anyone reading this has managed to build their portfolio up to a point where you could quit your job, how much would I need?

I understand that it varies from person to person due to lifestyle choices so I’ll give some info.

I’m a pretty frugal person, I can live off of $10-20k a year quite happily although, I’ll be conservative and say that I might end up spending $50k a year if I decide to start any hobbies or projects that might require some extra cash.
I’ll either continue stock picking, or if I want to dedicate my time entirely towards a passion or a project, I might just diversify it in multiple assets but put more than 70% into index funds like the S&P 500 and such.
I’ll keep at least 2 years worth of expenses in cash at all times so that I can live without having to sell any assets at a lousy price in case of a pretty bad market crash.

Now, I hear some people saying “Do the math” and I have, I’ve calculated that I need a little over a million dollars to do be able to quit but I’ve seen other posts where people say that you need much more. I don’t know why they say this though, but I’m assume they know something I don’t. Thanks :)

Edit: I just realized that I may have used the wrong flair. I don’t think I can change it.. Sorry about that.
(Looks like the mods changed it to the correct flair) thanks mods :)

Edit 2: TL;DR: How much money do I need invested in an index fund at average return rate to retire. Living off of 10-50k a year?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"So let's math this...

If you're well invested, you can assume 8-9% returns annually.
But that's pre-tax money.   And you are saying you can live off of $50k/yr assuming hobbies and such.   So that's about $80k before capital gains taxes.

For 8% return to generate $80k you'll need a nut of $1 million.  In that way you would never touch your principle,  and live only off your gains. 

And you'd need to work two more years from the time you hit 1 mil, in order to have 2yrs of living money liquid, per your plan.

Sounds like a noble goal - best of luck!"
03/16/2021,stocks,You need to go to r/financialindependence or r/fire. There is a world of research on this topic. A 3.5 to 4% withdrawal rate is a safe bet for a truly early retirement; the trick is estimating your future expenses.  Health care is the one that tends to screw uo people’s  budgets.
03/16/2021,stocks,"With my current profile, I would need about 6 million invested to live off dividends."
03/16/2021,stocks,You need to figure out how long you would live after you retire. There is a growing body of evidence on the pitfalls of retirement savings because people are living to be much older. Those who are 90 and above. FIRE might be a bad idea if you end up living to be more than 80. If you get to 100 then retirement savings aren't designed to last that long. This is why a lot CFP advised against FIRE and go with FI only. Retire at 55-60 and you will have millions in your accounts.

03/16/2021,stocks,"As a 33 year old with $1.3M, I plan to keep pounding back until $3M. Even though my annual spend is sub $80k. The 4% rule only works if you are flexible to drop spending down to 2% during bad years. So the 4% is probably the max withdraw range when you factor in inflation, but during bad years in the market, you need to adjust. The more one can adjust and be flexible, they can stretch their funds forever."
03/16/2021,stocks,Don't be too conservative. You will probably want to be productive later in life and earn some money anyway. I didn't like my job and saved up enough to retire at age 41. It turns out I was too conservative and I could have quit much earlier. I had a fun part-time job flying drones for 4 years and I also flip things on the side.

03/16/2021,stocks,"Just remember...when people don't work, they tend to spend more money.  I think you are underestimating what your expenses will be.  

There are some big questions that need to be answered.  Like are you single?  If yes, are you planning to get married?  If married, how many kids?  Do you own a home?  What are the absolute minimum you need to maintain your home if you have one?  

I think going forward, your single biggest expense will be healthcare cost.  If you are provided healthcare through your employer, you'll be in for a SHOCK on what private insurance cost."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Single and no kids? If you’re north of $500K, it shouldn’t be too hard for your growth to outpace your spending on a level to make it worthwhile. 

However, many of us recently saw a 25% or more dip in our portfolios. If you saw the same, but you held firm on your strategy and returned to within a few percent of your ATH since then, you’re getting closer. 

If you cashed out, or if you completely upended your strategy, keep your day job and keep plugging away.

03/16/2021,stocks,"Math.  Inflation matters, even at 2-3%.  If you're living off your gains and dividends that doesn't grow your portfolio and Inflation will eat you away.   Plan on saving enough to allow enough of your return to remain invested and grow at or above Inflation. 

Don't forget to budget life and health insurance. Do a long term budget.  If you make a car last 20 years,  budget that cost after Inflation over 20 years.  Same with home repair,  a new roof every thirty years at least.   How often are you going to need a new phone or computer.   The monthly expenses are easy to budget,  dont forget about the ones that only show up every 10 years.

Talk to some old people about their budgets if you can.  How much are meds when you're old.  Remember,  social security is based on what you put in so if you retire early you aren't going to get as much and your savings will have to cover more when you're old."

03/16/2021,stocks,I think a conservative estimate for a diversified annual dividend return is about 5%.  Subsiding on just dividends ensures you don’t eat away at your principal amount.  So you’d need a cool $1M to take home $50k a year pretax.

Then look at a high-dividend ETF like VYM and figure out how many shares you need to own to generate your desired level of income.

03/16/2021,stocks,"understand that a value of a company and the dividend paid is tied together. The cash flows paid out can be held by the company and the company value goes up by the cash value all things being equal. It’s basic finance 101, if a company doesn’t pay a 2% dividend; you can sell 2% of it, and if the cash flows from company operations are 2% of the market cap and they hold it, it’s the same effect. The big changes is the multiple expansion and contraction over time. So it doesn’t work for high fliers or growth stocks. But works for big cap or stable value companies."

2021-03-16 07:32:23,stocks,Any recs on stocks information and research? I saw this post the other day knocking down Motley Fool. I found it incredibly helpful as I was starting out with stocks and information. Is there another site you recommend looking at for help on general market trends and stock information?
03/16/2021,stocks,"* If you're interested in a company, read their 10K and 10Q filings
* Start learning about price multiples (P/S, P/E, P/B, P/FCF), and learn about how they vary depending on market cap, top-line revenue, operating income, and net income
* Realize that each sector and each industry is different, so compare companies you're interested in to its peers and leaders within its sector/industry

If all this sounds complicated, it's because your other options are to rely on the work of others, which will be done with as little effort or research as possible. By the time Zacks or JPMorgan or Wedbush recognize a particular stock as a strong buy or overweight or whatever their scale says, it has already grown by a lot, and that missed growth is what you're looking for to beat the market. The only way to find it in time is to start learning to do the hard work yourself."

03/16/2021,stocks,This is a great reminder to always get multiple sides of research for something. Thanks!
03/16/2021,stocks,"Reading your reply made me think of a few things:

Some people like to say start w/ paper trading first, to get your feet wet. Eff that. Nothing motivates learning like having real skin in the game. (But in the learning phase, definitely only put in a small amount of skin.) So I came up with a couple exercises to do with however much real money you're game to use putting into a lesson (that is still reasonably poised to yield some profit).

First one is based on the idea that semiconductor/chipmaker stocks will continue to trend upward for another couple years. Check the [SOXX etf's holdings](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239705/ishares-phlx-semiconductor-etf). Do some research to decide which one (or two, tops) will beat the ETF. You pick the time horizon. For the exercise, I'd say 3-6 months is ideal. put about 1 percent or so of your portfolio into that one, or split it among the two. Document why you picked them and what makes you think they'll beat the others. Track the progress of what you picked, the ETF, and maybe a loser or two if you find one you particularly dislike. If you're right, great! If you're wrong, come back and make another post. Tell us what you picked and why, and tell us what you think you missed in making your choices and ask for some opinions - on top of doing more of your own reading of course. 

Second one is potentially a little riskier, depending on the direction you want to take it, and it's centered on the assumption that lithium mining/production is a growing industry. Decide if you like a large company like ALB or SQM, a small company like LAC or LTHM, or a micro company like LIACF. Which do you think is the best fit for your risk profile? Which will yield the most returns over a 1- or 3-year period? What about over a shorter term?

(If you get shares of a small or micro company, there's lots of risk and volatility. Only get as many shares as you can stomach the possibility of losing 20 or 30 percent or maybe even more in a short period of down-swing.)

Disclosures: not a pro, not financial advise, yadda yadda. I hold leaps in SOXX as well as several of its holdings, and I am also long in SQM, LTHM, and LIACF."

2021-03-16 07:17:31,stocks,"Trading Foreign Stocks: OTC and Volatility Hey, 

So, I’ve been interested in investing in Japanese companies and already have a position in the BBJP ETF for the TSE Index. But, I wanted to be a little bit more bullish and buy shares from companies such as SoftBank and Rakuten, especially since Rakuten is expanding in the US and already just made a deal with Walmart.

The situation: Foreign stocks with no ADR, according to [this article](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/s/pros-cons-buying-foreign-stocks-132848219.html), can only be traded via OTC.

That’s fine.

The Question: Since these stocks are traded OTC and not through an exchange, is the price influenced by the action of the foreign exchange or is it being affected by the domestic sentiment? These stocks have very low volume, which makes the volatility not as extreme, but apparently the risk is higher if it gets PnD — but can that PnD volatility affect the OTC stock and visa versa?

Thanks so much :)

EDIT: BBJP ETF has its portfolio built on stocks listed on the TSE and Nagoya Stock Exchange, not the OTC alternatives offered here in America."

I'm expecting names like Alex Delarge, Canadian Jennifer, Clairvoyant Trader, George Sharp (people on Twitter) and a few others to be going down quite soon.

03/16/2021,stocks,"Did you read the complaint? 

This guy fabricated emails and other forms of corporate communication about the defunct company, shared it with his nearly 20,000 followers, and left them holding the bag on many companies. 

The CEO and others from this defunct company reached out to the SEC to tell them this was happening, and to try to clear their name. 

In addition, someone over at the penny stocks sub noticed a Reddit account that was likely his, shilling companies on Reddit that he was pumping and dumping. 

How is this guy just a “retail investor”? I feel like I’m taking crazy pills, how are people defending this?

If you have proof of actual crimes being committed, report them to the SEC and let them investigate. This one was so easy to investigate because the CEO of the company was willing to say “hey I never sent these emails.”"

03/16/2021,stocks,"Of course you can say things that might move the price of an asset. That's never been illegal. The issue is if you make realized gains off false information. Elon saying ""we bought bitcoin"" and bitcoin goes up is not an issue. That's expected. It's no different than amazon announcing they're acquiring a company through a formal sec filing. The guy they're prosecuting is comparable to elon buying bitcoin, ""tweeting we will buy 1T of bitcoin over the next 3 years,"" then just dumps his existing pile after the news runup. It's about materially false information. 

For example, the SEC gave him a 40M fine and removed him from being the chairman when he said he could take Tesla private at $420 per share — a substantial premium to its trading price at the time — that funding for the transaction had been secured, and that the only remaining uncertainty was a shareholder vote. 

https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226

He had that penalty, and he didn't even profit off the false tweet. That's just a penalty for saying something false that significantly effected other investors. He would have been fucked if that tweet coincided with a huge personal stock sale."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I made some $$ after Trump called for a boycott of General Tire. Bought some stock; and after the hysteria died down, sold it."
03/16/2021,stocks,Not Elon anymore they warned him formally.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Elon largely got away with his $420 tweet because he didn't actually sell and profit off of it.

03/16/2021,stocks,"When he sold his shares while up a million dollars, who do you think was on the other end of that trade? The company was a complete scam and a lot of people - not institutions (they wouldn‘t be trading a dark/defunct OTC) - lost a lot of money in his scheme. So yes, good job SEC for protecting retail investors."
03/16/2021,stocks,"The guy fabricated emails with the executives of this defunct company to mislead investors into thinking this company was actually resuming operations, to get them to buy a stock he loaded up on. 

Those executives reached out to the SEC to complain and clear their name. 

How are you painting this as overreach?"
03/16/2021,stocks,They've been prosecuting this for a long time. Here's a case from 2000: https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/21/business/sec-says-teenager-had-after-school-hobby-online-stock-fraud.html
03/16/2021,stocks,Lol you clearly didn’t read the complaint. This guy isn’t some retail investor. He fabricated evidence to mislead investors into buying stock he loaded up on using fraudulent information and by impersonating company executives.
03/16/2021,stocks,He bought a fake company website from a broke out of business company and lied and made up emails from the CEO about profits and company sales.. this isn’t jus5 making up stuff on Twitter. He went above and beyond buying Twitter followers and names to pump the stock.
03/16/2021,stocks,"> This is a slippery slope they should not pass

It's unfortunate, but so many people misunderstand ""slippery slope"" - it's a *fallacy* in which a person claims that something *must* go down a slope, despite that fact that it doesn't *have* to... and you're committing it here.

That is, they could pass this, and that could be the end of it. It's not a valid argument to say that because *more* could happen, this shouldn't. There's plenty of reasons these kinds of laws need safeguards and well thought through, but you should be making solid arguments, not nonsense ones, let alone about false statements regarding a defunct company in an obvious pump-n-dump."
03/16/2021,stocks,"SEC doesn't prosecute stupid opinions. It's intentionally false facts about a business that you also profit from. Like saying you have inside info that this bs penny stock just partnered with amazon and had sold 100M units in the last quarter when you just made it all up. Then you share it to a big audience. Then you sell after people buy in. That's significantly different than posting bad DD on reddit. 

If you're at all worried, stay away from shilling penny stocks, and you can probably freely post all the bad DD you want. There's generally 0 chance any post you make about a normal stock will materially effect the price."
03/16/2021,stocks,you think they just have one guy working on one case at a time?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Probably not. Someone made a complaint and the SEC investigated. Expect more SEC enforcement under Biden. If you have a complaint, don't just beat your chest, make a complaint WITH documentation. Say, for example, there is a short ladder attack on some stock. Give the SEC a printout of the minute by minute transactions so they have a starting point to investigate."

He must have been talking about the fruit not the company. If I recall Apple IPO'ed at $80."
03/16/2021,stocks,If you believe it. Document his comments and file a complaint. I wonder if Cramer practices his expressions in front of a mirror?
03/16/2021,stocks,"IMHO the SEC should not allow any short failures to deliver. When they drive the price of a stock down, it it the shareholders that loose. (How would you feel if your portfolio became valueless so the hedge funds make money?) To stop failures to deliver, they should be fined for each share they do not have."
03/16/2021,stocks,So does reddit. Like why do you guys think Melvin is still trading in it when they said they got out at a big loss months ago?
03/16/2021,stocks,He defrauded innocent people out of a million dollars and caused them to lose millions more. This is a serious crime. Not sure what part you're getting stuck on.

What makes you lump him in with people like Alex Delarge?

He has promoted one company that he worked with on his website, but I don't think that comes anywhere near the scummy behaviour of the others."

03/16/2021,stocks,"I mean it seems like your main complaint is that he talks shit about stocks? Which is totally fine, but that's a different ball game to pump and dumps. I looked up that name and found a lot of people who are angry that he.. talked shit about an investment they had made. I'm just not seeing it. Saying that you think a stock is a scam is not fraudulent in the same way that promoting a stock you \*know\* is a scam is.

As far as his companies go, I see him mention them (why wouldn't he?) but he does not seem to engage in pumping them as far as I can see. You're making really generic claims like ""sketchy tactics"" but you're not really showing that he's done anything actually wrong?

I don't want to come off as being overly defensive of this guy, because it really doesn't matter to me in the end. I'm following him precisely because he's so negative (I don't see any value in information from people who \*only\* promote stocks) and I certainly don't think he's infallible or anything like that. I'm just really curious what the objection is other than that he's kind of an asshole and he is negative about a lot of stocks."

And SEC, you’ve let down the majority for the few. This won’t end well for you in the long run."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You're not seeing it because, like you said, you just started following the guy. His posts are clear manipulation. Do the digging or don't, I don't really care. You're free to follow him. I have first hand experience with something he called a scam. 

It's a lot more than him being an asshole, and it's all readily available. Just look at his interactions with people. And that's about all I'm interested into lending my energy to the world of George Helischauer."
03/16/2021,stocks,No I just meant like do you get valuable trading information from twitter?
03/16/2021,stocks,Source that they didn't close their shorts? I think the most likely situation is melvin did close their shorts and others didn't and/or new shorts came in. It's not like melvin was the only one shorting gamestop.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm more than willing to believe that he might be doing something untoward and I put absolutely no faith in any random guy on Twitter. But again you're not really saying anything concrete about what he's actually done that's wrong. I'm not saying you're wrong or lying or anything, I'd just like more information to help my own research.

Let's take an example - the claim that he has a ""past of suing companies he invested in who didn't have the money to fight."" I'm aware that George has some history of using the law (he admits as such). From what I have read from George's side, he has done things like subpoenaing records to help with cases against scams. This in itself is a perfectly acceptable thing to do. I am not saying that this is a 100% trustworthy account because it comes from George, obviously. But I'm not seeing anything on the other side to make me doubt it. So, do you have a specific case in mind when you say this so I can research it?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"They are using ETFs to naked short the ticker to get people to sell. ETFs like XRT. Yesterday they were identical. They are literally walking down mainstreet in the nude acting like they got clothes on.

03/16/2021,stocks,"Alright, well I'm happy to leave it, and I'm certainly not blindly trusting anyone. I find George's negativity useful as long as you're not the kind to accept everything at face value (basically - if George is saying it's a scam, it's worth taking another look at least, even if you don't believe him), and I'll definitely keep what you've said in mind when evaluating him and researching in future."

End of week price target doesn't register with me; these aren't pump and dump growth stocks.

03/16/2021,stocks,"Cruises and airlines are pumped up because there's a significant amount of hype and overconfidence. People want to ""return to normal"" and Biden's claim that all Americans will be **eligible** for vaccination by May 1 kind of turns hype into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

If you take a closer look at cruise lines, they're actually in a lot of debt and/or regularly diluting shares. IMO, a bit risky to go long on cruise stocks.

Airlines are a bit better, but it's too early to tell how much impact COVID will have in the ""re-open"" and beyond phases. It's not like people will suddenly stop telecommuting to work altogether. 

Oil isn't a sexy and obvious recovery play when compared to airlines, cruises, and cinemas. That said, after being pent up for so long, people will want to travel. What do most modes of transportation need? Yes, petroleum. With OPEC controlling supply, and demand likely to increase \[possibly significantly\], oil prices will go up. And so will oil company share prices. 

That being said, not sure about XOM specifically. Seems like insiders were buying shares recently, but also seems like there's some tension between the board/mgmt and shareholders.

oil - and most companies - are not going away for at least 10-25 years.

get in, hold. lean back. reinvest dividends. rinse, repeat"
03/16/2021,stocks,XOM needs demand to come back. It is coming so just wait. XOM is a $100 stock in due time.
03/16/2021,stocks,The price of oil can change. It’s risky business. The cruise lines don’t have a business right now BUT they have ridiculously full order backlogs for the next years (plural!).
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't think oil is going away anytime soon. However, XOM has a shitload of debt. In my opinion CVX looks more attractive at the moment."
03/16/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/16/2021,stocks,Anything below 60 will be gone. Oil supply was cut and demand will rise for the summer months.
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah I kind of want to exit my position but not at a loss so I’d like to get out by end of this week

Ah, buy puts on /cl"
03/16/2021,stocks,I ask end of week because I’m over invested and need to reduce my position (options)
03/16/2021,stocks,Any names to look at in particular for natgas or drillers?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yea Exxon used to be the gold standard of oil but everything I read seems to indicate that they've been falling apart lately, their stock was going downward pre covid. Plus they have an activist investor that's trying to get green energy people on the board and stuff. 

Nothing against green energy at all and I'm sure his head is in the right place morally, but all of us peons who are just trying to retire before we are 65 have more at stake then some billionaire's dream to make Exxon a green company. I've been in CVX since November and I'll probably hold those shares till I retire"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah so is carnival cruise lines that hasn’t sailed a ship in a year. 

Party city is up 300%… who the fuck us having parties during a pandemic. 

Everything is overvalued. So relatively speaking, the energy sector should have room. 

XOM pre covid was in the 70’s btw"
03/16/2021,stocks,How about CVX?
03/16/2021,stocks,Yea but the price of oil doesn’t necessarily correlate to XOM. I mean XOM was making money all day long back when crude was a lot cheaper. I think Exxon *should be fine* with crude costing more than 50. And hopefully in great shape with crude more than 60
03/16/2021,stocks,"No way, less oil drilling means higher oil prices. Higher prices mean more revenue for oil companies."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yea. I only hold 1% of my total portfolio on Oil related. Oil price going up bc of the lack of supply, not because of the crazy demand. Soon as everything goes back to normal, oil price will surge as the demand kicks in. Biden banned new drilling on fed land for 3months. We will see what biden’s decision later on. But his goal is increase the oil price, forcing people to move to EVs and green energy. Bio-Fuel stocks are heading to the moon, check out AMTX GPP GPRE. It was penny stock, and now they worth sth"

what fuelrod said. Also, $CLNE just announced a big deal with BP and CVX. Some good price movement for them already, but I think they have room to run. They get a lot of revenue from tax credits that I'm gambling will remain with the Biden admin. Also, $TALO runs a small rigging shop, kinda like a sub contractor. They get a lot of notice on robinhood and seem to be in a correction right now. Might be worth the flyer as the price can move quickly with positive oil news. 

Keep in mind, energy is never a short-term play. I am super bullish on the economy and all my recent purchases in energy are 3-4 year plays."
03/16/2021,stocks,"we’re not talking about CCL or party city lmao. Might as well include GME or AMC dummy . 

I’m just answering your question, XOM has already made a big run up, sure you can squeeze in some gains but there’s better opportunities.

check ET. got way more upside, check those 1/22 calls for $10."
03/16/2021,stocks,Also going up. All the oil majors are benefiting from the same macro trends.
03/16/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/16/2021,stocks,"""Forcing people to move to EV's and green energy"" 

That's just a political stunt which will accomplish nothing in the long run for the following reasons: 

\- Solar even at 100% capacity on a sunny day would require an absurd amount of panels to power a sizable portion of an energy grid. 

\- Wind requires fossil fuels to manufacture and repair the turbines, and while in a theoretical world you could build enough of them to power large cities you'll still need back up plants running on idle that are powered by coal and natural gas. 

\- Hydro is only available in certain geographic areas

\- Nuclear fission is carbon neutral, but government regulations and oversight are never going to allow it to take over the grid. 

\- Nuclear fusion is a totally hypothetical technology that may not even be possible. It is creating a small sun in a box which boils water. 

So yea, not only will oil companies be around in 50 years, they will probably be 10x as big as the population continues to grow because unfortunately those EV's still use gas. And that's assuming EV's even replace gas cars, which isn't a guarantee at all, they might remain trendy upper and middle class cars like hybrids."
03/16/2021,stocks,What kind of news? I know it’s all speculation but lmk!

03/16/2021,stocks,"Hahaha, what do you use to power boats and jets?   Candle sticks?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"While I agree with all the challenges you’ve outlined, at current oil consumption rates, we will run out of oil 100 years from now. Along the way, oil prices will rise significantly which will make other sources more competitive."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Not financial advice, but Exxon will probably be 80 within a few years, and it will definitely hit at least pre corona 70 at some point. I personally like Chevron more because they have the most US reserves besides BP, and I like the idea of a company owning oil here and not somewhere like Guyana or Brazil. But you'll be fine holding exxon, I would not sell for a loss."

I have about 50K of cash ready to deploy at appropriate moments, not all of it at once necessarily, but looking for good entry points, primarily in tech and growth sectors. All these positions will be long holds at minimum 5 years ideally 10-15 for most. I am 24 years old I have a fairly well diversified portfolio that I have been growing and building for a little less than a decade; holdings are listed below. I have a medium - high risk tolerance for this final chunk of cash to deploy. I'm planning to potentially increase my positions in PLTR, FB, DOCU PYPL and DIS and maybe a few others but as I said I'm also looking for some names to add that aren't on this list. I'd like to find a few names that have lots of room for potential growth even if they are on the risky side but high potential payouts. I have a well balanced portfolio with a large percentage of my assets in ETF's and low risk assets so I'm looking for a few more speculative, aggressive plays to make, any and all advice is welcome; as well as comments/critiques on my current holdings.

03/16/2021,stocks,"I'd suggest a few more old school stocks like HD, WMT, ABT, TMO, etc.  You have a lot of tech and financials and those might help balance things out.

At the end of the day though, your portfolio should be what you know.  I've said it before but I'll say it again.  Diversification for the sake of diversification isn't great.  If you're investing in stocks just because they're outside your heavily weighted sectors without doing any real research on them, you might end up worse off.

I'm very tech / green energy heavy in my portfolio but I've been adding more to the tickers I mentioned at the beginning of this post to try and diversify a bit."

Some names I like there are abbv bmy generally I like indexes for healthcare because it can be hard to follow; arkg xbi are good if your willing to hold and can stomach some volatility.

I’ve been researching more and more ETFs, generally ignoring ones that cost over $100 just to buy into. Let’s say I get myself into 20 smaller time ETFs (each share worth between $25-50), should I stop around there and just keep putting money into the ones I’ve gotten?"

03/16/2021,stocks,See if you can do fractional shares of something like VOO and QQQ QQQJ etc. Your current picks are a bit risky and the market is a bit tired of high risk bets. Some risk is ok. Too much in a market like we have now leaves you at risk of losses

* 100% ABALX (Consists of 50-75% equities)

I'm currently maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA. Not contributing anything to my brokerage account atm. I've been contributing to my 401k for less than a year, so it will continue to grow significantly faster than the rest, but I'm worried that I will have too little in equities.

(This isn't financial advice)

(Sorry if I missed some huge points)

Bull Case:

1. 50% or more of gaming apps have unity inside of their software. Mobile games is projected to grow massively in a few years and this presents a unique chance for them as the top 1,000 games it was reported 71% of them had unity in them. 
2. They’re also debt free company which is another huge thing because more liquidity.
3. Unity Technologies posted a Q4 revenue of $220.3 million, up 39%.
4.  Unity's c-suite has emphasized that its focus is on growth in the non-gaming market 
5. Video game market is growing and Unity is still that guy in the sector.
6. Unity is also growing into the e commerce sector slowly, but hasn't all together hit the ground.  RestAR allows fashion brands, online retailers, and marketers to scan and reproduce physical products in high-quality 3D, using only a mobile device. RestAr is fairly new and I will give it 4-5 more years before its being used more often. Nonetheless it presents a unique revenue stream.

Bear Case:

1. High P/S ratio 
2. Growth margin will be negative for the next few years 
3. Biggest competitor (Epic games/Unreal Engine) is reporting healthy margins and posting insane numbers. 

&#x200B;

 What do I think? 

I think that they have a lot of work to do and if they want to top Unreal Engines they can do so by remodeling. Also should Unity trade at this current price its p/s will drop so that will leave the current bear case. I personally think that with no other stocks like it in the market it presents a very unique investment. I still personally believe in Unity, but they have a long road ahead of them.

Positions: 10 shares at 105$. Will add more soon."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I have spent 1000s on their platform for my own experiments.

I have also looked up unreal, lumberyard, etc.

One of the biggest thing about unity is all the third parties providing all sorts of tools.

Have been eyeing $U for a while now."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I am a fan of the software and think they will continue to grow. 
Didn’t know lockup expiry was happening soon would you expect a decent sized dip?"
03/16/2021,stocks,I think the lock up already expired in feb 8th. I sold my shares at loss after realizing this fact.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Gaming might not even be their most important industry in the future. Their software has a lot of promise for engineering, filmmaking, real estate, and so on."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I like Unity, but Epic has the professional side and Godot has the free/open source side, so Unity needs to decide where they stand in the future."
03/16/2021,stocks,"There are quite a few great engines you can get started with for free by now, Cryengine is another one that comes to mind. Competition is tough. To be real honest, I have worked woth it and don't really like Unity all too much. It has its upsides, but for large projects it's horrible imo."
03/16/2021,stocks,I am insanely bullish on AR (and VR to a lesser extend) and I am looking for the best stock in this market. FB and Apple are looking good but they already have massive marketcaps so growth is limited. I love unity but it is valued pretty high and I dont know that much about the industry. If anyone knows some other interesting stocks about ar/vr please let me know!
03/16/2021,stocks,"ABSOLUTELY yes. I've been a bull on U since day 1, and the price it fell to made it *absurdly* undervalued. Even at $111 it's an excellent price. 

Keep in mind the lockup period was broken up into several dates. This is only the FINAL lockup period ending. There were three other sets of shares released, so this one will not be as big as you might expect."
03/16/2021,stocks,buy the dip
03/16/2021,stocks,"I have used professionally UE4, but guess what I bought? And no I haven't even downloaded Unity as an engine."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Agreed, Unity is also the easiest 3d game engine framework to get started in, but they still suffer from being a bit of a meme engine.  They watermark all games made with the 'free' license. This means people still have a negative view of unity based on some of the crappy games people have made outweighing the good ones."
03/16/2021,stocks,"They actually allowed shares to be sold when the stock went public and already had a partial lockup expiry in February. 

I don’t think the stock dips much (uninformed guess would be 3-5%), especially because Goldman put out a bullish note on them today.

Biggest threat is rapid yields and inflation IMO."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It won't be a big dip, as this is a segmented lockup."
03/16/2021,stocks,(https://www.marketbeat.com/ipos/lockup-expirations/) here the dates are.
03/16/2021,stocks,Also I think that might have been a partial expiry.
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah absolutely. The recent lion king movie was made with Unity.
03/16/2021,stocks,Yep their VR engine is also helping industrials. (such as GM with car design...)
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah I’ve heard that a few times. I’m not specifically in that field, but if Unity were to change and be able to work with larger groups rather than small would you give it a go? If Unity were to adapt its software to ease it with larger groups do you think it would be the big dog?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I am not disagreeing, yet I think one thing real game devs tend to forget: pure volume of shitty and even decent mobile games. sure we can look at major PC / console games and wonder who on earth would use Unity for online fps, MMO´s whatnot. yet  Unity has distinct advantages when it comes to rapid deployment of mobile games. and even though it´s a tough market, its a growing market as well. 

I am not sure engines like Cryengine (about 3 % market share) really play a role in this. Unreal and Unity do. In the mobile market alone, Unity is still ahead. 

with Gameing market projected to grow by over 13% from now to 2027 , I am pretty confident Unity is not a bad choice. 

I mean, there are plenty of other companies that are vastly overvalued. why not a piece of game dev software ?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"In no particular order Snap, Alphabet, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Pinterest, Nintendo, Samsung, Tencent, Alibaba, Sony and sectors such as lidar, semiconductors and 5g. To watch not public yet: Epic games, Niantic, Magic leap"
03/16/2021,stocks,What’s your fair value? I’m pretty bullish on it because it has the potential to be a great short term and long term play.
03/16/2021,stocks,Absurdly? Wow.
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah. Honestly if unreal had a ipo I would invest.
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah but thankfully game developers dont pick game engines to work in based on public meme perception so it doesnt present a threat to Unity's sales
03/16/2021,stocks,Correct. The stock was a healthy 150+ before all that 10-yr yield jazz
03/16/2021,stocks,"This is from their prospectus:

""beginning on the earlier of (i) the opening of trading on the second trading day immediately following our release of earnings for the quarter ending December 31, 2020 and (ii) the 181st day after the date of this prospectus, the remainder of the shares of our common stock will be eligible for sale in the public market from time to time thereafter.""

Q4 earnings released on Feb 5 so I'm pretty sure Feb 8 was the lockup expiry and the market beat date is no longer correct."
03/16/2021,stocks,Interesting. I may start buying few shares if it dips
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think Unity's big appeals are:  
1) Using C# for scripting and plugins, because it's an extremely powerful programming language, yet relatively easy to use. Visual Studio is also an outstanding IDE, especially for C#, and works together with Unity rather well.  
2) It's relatively beginner friendly as you can do quite a lot in little time without having to set up too much stuff. Basic things are also more or less straightforward and there are a lot of tools built in.  
3) Once you are used to it, it's very easy to create a lot of content very fast, depending on how good you want it to be of course. 

When it comes to big projects, you want maximise your productivity and collaborate with your team as good as possible. Now while basics are not too hard, there is a lot of stuff that is neither straightforward nor convenient at all. You permanently run into issues you'd think are rather basic and be like:""I can't possibly be the first one to try and do this, can I?"", and then Unity has no (native) solution for it whatsoever, so you have to work around it or use third party stuff constantly. Or there is a way to do it, but it's way more complicated than it has to be. The UI is sometimes clunky and unintuitive as well and some things feel oddly out of place. There are a lot of tools but almost all of them lack some kind of functionality you'd expect. I'd say it's rather easy to make mistakes and sometimes you have to manually revert them because it's not done by pressing ""undo"". Moreover I can't speak for Unity's inbuilt colab-tool, but using Unity along with a standard Git client can turn into an absolute nightmare really quick. You actually have to be very careful not to mess anything up and that alone is stressful enough for me to not want to do that.  

So can Unity get better? It will require quite a bit of work if you ask me, but on the other hand they already kinda have their niche. Wanna make a AAA game? Don't use Unity. You don't? Might as well use Unity. Nobody is going to care if your indie game is full of hacky solutions or has some weird bugs."
03/16/2021,stocks,">sure we can look at major PC / console games and wonder who on earth would use Unity for online fps, MMO´s whatnot 

This sentiment has become a bit outdated. Escape from Tarkov is one of the biggest FPS games right now and caters to the hardcore audience that cares a lot about things like response times, bullet physics, etc, yet it was made in Unity. The gap between Unity and Unreal in this area is far closer than it used to be.

I'm not sure how Unity would stack up to Unreal for developing an MMO. Most MMO's I am aware of use their own in-house engines.

Unreal still has an edge in the high-performance PC and console markets, especially since the release of UE5, but the gap has been steadily closing over the past few years. Unity has a clear advantage over Unreal in the case of mobile due to it's accessibility and portability. It's a lot of effort to make Unreal games run across many platforms, plus you can't take advantage of many of UE's best features on mobile devices so it'd be an odd choice for developing mobile games. For this reason, I think Unity is much better positioned to eat into Unreal's market share than than the other way around.

Luckily for Epic, they are more than just a game engine developer. They own quite a few popular games now, including the major cash cow that is Fortnite, and they've got the Epic Game Store to compete against Steam (no idea if that is a profitable venture yet, though). Even if Unreal does lose some market share to Unity, Epic has enough good things going for them to make them worth taking a look at as well if they were to go public any time soon."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Personally I’d stay away from magic leap. I’m a VR dev with some AR exp and magic leap seems to always be down on their luck. 
Fwiw the most used VR on Steam is the Quest 2, so FB would be a good pick for that. VR takes a lot of company resources I think- there’s not a lot of smaller operations that survive. 
Oh- the PicoNeo... pico gen? Pico something is a new headset to the market but idk what their quality is."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Damn I thought Epic was public fuck now I feel real stupid. Anyway, do buy U."
03/16/2021,stocks,Oh. Maybe that’s why it took such nose dive last month. I apologize for not going deeper in my search.
03/16/2021,stocks,"using EFT especially is extremely problematic . I played EFT for about 4 years and I agree that it is really respectable zto see what they acco,plished with the unity engine, EFT probably has the worst netcode and FPS performance of any shooter out there. it looks awesome. in terms of netcode, response time and sever tick speed it plays like a turd.

if this was meant to serve as an argument for Unity as a good engine for excelltn online games of great complexity , you better think again. 

wih everything else I agree. 
Unity and Unreal (Epic) are both pretty good picks to invest into."
03/16/2021,stocks,Isn't Epic owned by Sony?
03/16/2021,stocks,I was actully worried thinking that it was tomorrow as well as my average cost basis is $130 but according to their prospectus it looks like the lockup was expired in Feb. Goldman gave U a buy rating today as well so hopefully it'll continue this uptrend!
03/16/2021,stocks,I think one of the main reasons for the dive was Apple's announcement of upcoming changes to its privacy policy.  Many folks believed that those changes would adversely affect Unity's revenue.
03/16/2021,stocks,">Unity and Unreal (Epic) are both pretty good picks to invest into.

Epic is not public company tho"
03/16/2021,stocks,Pretty sure it's Tencent who has a decent ownership in Epic. It's still mainly owned by Tim Sweeney
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah I was thinking about opening a few may 110$ calls. I’m still gonna watch it for a few more days. Good luck to both us in our quest!

2021-03-16 05:00:06,stocks,"QYLD vs VTI. I can’t figure out why one is considered “risky” while another one is “buy and hold and forget”. I have been seeing a lot of comments about QYLD being “risky” because it has options while VTI is a holly grail.  Now I don’t disagree - VTI is one of those buy and forget investments and I have quite a bit of money in it. However, if you look at top holdings for both of them - they are almost identical: 

Apple Inc.
Microsoft Corp.
Amazon.com Inc.
Alphabet Inc.
Facebook Inc.
Tesla Inc.

Why?  Because they all are tech and they are on the list of top 500 companies, so they make both indices. 

So both these indices have quite a bit of overlap. Obviously S&P 500 has a lot more non-tech companies in addition but since they are weighted by market cap, we all know who the big players are. 

Now, QYLD only invests 70% into the index. The rest goes to write options to generate consistent income of 11%. Quite impressive in comparison to VTI.  

So either I am totally missing something or QYLD is a pretty vanilla index fund with a beta of .7 with decent yield. And VTI is also a very good generic ETF with a beta of 1.  

Am I missing something?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"QYLD is not an index fund. They do covered calls, capping the fund's potential growth but not its downside--you can see that it dropped about the same as QQQ during the Covid crash, then recovered much more slowly. QYLD offers you a strong present income stream, with the tradeoff that you won't match QQQ's growth in good years. If the present income matches your investment strategy, do it, but you'll probably make more money just buying QQQ instead."

03/16/2021,stocks,"QYLD is selling call options on the equities which is inherently bearish. When markets go up, QYLD will never perform as well as VTI. It would win in a bear market of course.

I have no idea why anybody would hold QYLD long term. It may be a good hedge for sideways action or a crash I guess"
03/16/2021,stocks,"QYLD yielded 11% the past year while QQQ yielded 0.5%. That's an anomaly because implied vols were elevated, but the point is the breakeven point isn't just QYLD returning as much as QQQ. Rather, it's QQQ returning 10.5% more than QYLD in one year, which doesn't happen very often unless you sell covered calls right after the market flash crashes and right before it bounces straight back up. It does happen though, which is why 2020 was a horrible year for QYLD.

I didn't find QYLD's exact strategy, but if e.g. it were selling 3% OTM calls monthly, then that would mean the investor would participate in up to (1 + 3%)^(12) \- 1 = 43% of returns a year while collecting yield on companies that don't actually make enough money today to pay yield. It's not the worst proposition. The danger of course is if the year's returns are chunky and are all concentrated in a single month."
03/16/2021,stocks,Mic drop
03/16/2021,stocks,"I looked into this once... Benchmarked QYLD vs QQQ (chosen because QYLD is based on selling covered calls on the Nasdaq 100), assuming you re-invested dividends... 

Since QYLD set their investment strategies in October 2015, QYLD would have turned $10k into $16.2k; QQQ would have turned that same $10k into $30.9k.

Long term, shit even medium term, QYLD is a losing strategy imo."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes!  LOL. Totally stand corrected.

2021-03-16 04:45:23,stocks,"Why would I buy Berkshire? Somewhat of a clickbait title, but let me explain myself.  
I love the idea of potentially being able to live off dividends when it becomes my time to retire. I would love to be able to never have to actually sell my retirement stocks to fund my retirement or do so at such a low rate that I should have plenty left over to pass on to someone when I die.

Getting to that point will require the use of tech/growth stocks now and then slowly transitioning into the dividend stocks later. 
  
So if I never make a dividend from Berkshire, the only way to actually use it to retire is sell it back for cash, which then cuts into the prospect of having stocks/bonds/etc left over to pass on to someone or sell it to reinvest it into a stock that DOES pay a dividend. And since Berkshire’s rate of return has been historically lower than the S&P it just doesn’t quite make sense to me to buy it now. It would only make sense to buy it as a hedge against a poor market if I was already wealthy and just wanted to park my money somewhere. 

  
So I ask again, why would I buy Berkshire?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Berkshire is great to maintain wealth when you’re already rich.  Think about it, if you have $10M, what is your goal?  Not to lose your $10M.  Yes, you want to get a return on investment, but you don’t want to lose your $10M.  Very different investing strategy when you’re already rich."

You can just sell stock instead which has retained earnings and has rose in value."

The ending dollar value of your investment is the same in both cases. I know people will say that they don’t want to lose shares, but it’s irrelevant. You would have fewer shares, but they would be worth more due to no dividend being paid out, and this would cancel out to give the same money in the end anyway. Running out of shares is not an issue either. If you always sell 2% of your shares each year, you will never run out."

03/16/2021,stocks,"This is a good fucking point especially given that BRK-A and BRK-B don't pay dividends. There are tons of good dividend stocks and ETFs out there. OP is either not rich (I'm not either) because they would either know this already, or would have a financial advisor to tell them they should know this. Or they just won the lottery and should be talking to a lawyer and financial advisor rather than those of us on Reddit. Berkshire is what I would call a midlife stock. You're not looking for fast short term gains, want something stable with a proven record, something fluid compared to mutual funds, but you want solid growth (just under 15% annualized growth in the last 10 years iirc). Now all of that said OP. I like Berkshire. But it's not a dividend stock period. 

ALSO: I'M NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, NOR IS THIS FINANCIAL ADVICE. I'M NOT A LAWYER. I'M A RANDOM REDDIT PERSON TRYING NOT TO LOSE THEIR DAMN BALLS IN THE MARKET.

EDIT: I missread OPs post. You would buy them because it's a much much better return on investment than a savings account.  I've never lost money with Berkshire. Ever. It's stable and diverse. So no it's not a ""leave the stock to my kids"" sort of company. It's a ""get stable growth that is flexible compared to other similarly stable investments"" stock. I would go so far to say it's the stability of an index fund that trades off a little growth for flexibility."

Qualified dividend top tax rate is 20?  LT cap gains is the same?

Qualified dividends get taxed at favorable rates, while non-qualified or ordinary dividends are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. The following four tables break down the current tax rates assessed on qualified dividends, depending on your taxable income and filing status in 2020 and 2021:

2020 Qualified Dividend Tax Rate	For Single Taxpayers	For Married Couples Filing Jointly	For Heads of Households
0%	Up to $40,000	Up to $80,000	Up to $56,600
15%	$40,001 to $441,450	$80,001 to $496,000	$53,601 to $469,050
20%	$441,451 or more	$496,601 or more	$469,051 or more

it's not fair to generalize is it? sure, plenty of people with shit loads of money want to continue to make shit loads of money. plenty of people are happy to live comfortably. unless you yknow, hang out with rich 50-60 something retire-ees i'd expect you'd not run into that group.

>Assuming that 10m is some net worth ""cut off"" where you switch from value investing to dividend investing shows me you have no idea what you're talking about

He just named a number. for plenty of people that's 1 or 2 or 3m, for some it's more. point being whatever amount lets you very safely live the lifestyle you want off withdrawals, or off dividend/growth, or with reduced growth but continuing to grow the overall value."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes and no. He's right in the sense of 10k in the S&P 500 is no more risky than 10 mil and while I love WB the dude definitely speaks from privilege of actually having billions and speaks strictly from the standpoint of wanting to retire by 65. A lot of people don't and therefore will be looking for riskier bets which yes, putting 10 mil into something super risky has way more relative risk than putting 10k into something. You can bounce back from losing 10k, gl if you lose 10 mil.

You have way more to lose with 10 mil and way more that you need to make with 10k and while putting 10mil or 10k into something stable like the S&P 500 is just as risky you have WAAAAY more downside by yoloing 10 mil over yoloing 10k and way more relative upside to 10k than you do with 10 mil(Turning 10k into 1 mil on a yolo is way more life changing than doubling your 10 mil for instance)."

03/16/2021,stocks,"As long as the company is in a safe industry, and has a low-ish PE ratio (high price floor for the stock price) you should be ok. 

The issue with only focusing on the dividend is that depending on the company you’re investing in, they may not be able to sustain the dividend because they’re losing money. General Electric, Ford, and GameStop are great examples of this. 

You’ll also still have general market movements that will tank the stock market in aggregate. Events such as 2000, 2008, 2020 still caused stable companies such as Microsoft, Verizon, Coke, Waste management etc to tank as general sell offs occur. So depending on your time horizon you’ll still be stuck holding these companies. Even if they keep their dividend you’ll still be looking at a loss depending on where you bought until the stock and economy recovers. 

Long story short it’s better to just invest in financially healthy companies (growing revenue, net income), in healthy industries (tech is the most prospering currently). 

I will say though that depending on how you want to live could make dividends more viable. If you have $1,000,000 in retirement and want to live off of $50,000 in dividends (assuming 5% yield and in safe companies like Coke). Dividends are certainly better for lower returns but less volatility as well!"

At some point I will have to slowly sell those risky non-dividend paying stocks to buy the still risky dividend stocks."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yea I’ve had a similar thought to you as well.

What can be a pain with non-dividend stocks is Wall Street sentiment can cause them to take a while for their price to explode. Lockheed Martin and CVS are standout examples because they aren’t interesting stock picks, yet kill it in earnings every year

Edit: Mark Cuban has acknowledged this as well and non-dividend payers.

From what I've seen it increases the long term cap gains tax on earners of over 1mil$ to the ordinary income tax rate (this is to close the carried interest tax loophole), gets rid of a bunch of deductions, increases the top tax rate to what it was pre-trump (+ ~3%), and raises the corporate tax rate 7%.

The tax cuts equated to roughly a 15% movement to the upside in the market.  Uncle Joe wants to raise corporate rates from the low to high 20% - a 25% corporate tax increase.  This will have a negative effect on the market.

In effect, an increase in taxes is money that a company doesn’t have to hire new employees, provide training, or to purchase equipment.  Generally, this will hit the tech companies hardest.  The line that taxes are only for ‘the rich’ is simply a ruse.  Tax increases will effect the market, overall - and everybody will pay."

this is blatantly obvious given the things biden says he wants to do. switching from a gas tax to a mileage based tax is going to be a tax hike on everyone. look at the rates for states that trialed this kind of system. they say ""it's only a penny or two per mile"", but a vehicle with a normal mpg rate sees their tax rate double.

also, he says he wants to eliminate the taxbreaks for passthrough llc's. if an llc is setup as a pass through, they're probably not even making 6 figures (never mind 400k).

That's not how THAT works because yes you have to pay taxes on the money you make but you still made more money then you would have had you not sold them at all. Say you either sell both houses and make a buttload of money because right now it's a seller's market and houses are going way above asking price in like a week of having them on the market (that is the current situation where I am) or if you can hold the houses but you know next year the housing market is going to tank and you won't be able to sell for nearly as much. Would you hold onto the houses and not sell just because of taxes? Probably not... Plus, most people don't have two houses to sell that they have to worry about taxes on lmao.

03/16/2021,stocks,"That's not how taxes work.  Plus, if you were to ""get lucky"" every decade and make a $1.6million windfall every decade your actual average annual income would work out to about $220k per year, meaning the top end of your earnings would be taxed at 32% with an effective rate of about 19.6%.  Assuming you file single (not making personal assumptions, just need a filing class for numbers) and you elect for the standard deduction, than in a typical year roughly 67% of your income is taxed at 12% or lower, with 13% taxed at 22% and the remainder at 0%.  This would work out to an effective tax rate of about 11%.  Every dollar you make currently up to your current income level will still be taxed at this effective tax rate of 11%, the increases only affect the income you make over that amount which is why the effective tax rate if you were making $220k per year is only 19.6% and not 32%.

But this year you will probably make $1.6mil, assuming you've actually realized those gains and don't lose them in the next 9 months.  With an annual earning of $1.6mil, and assuming these were all short term gains your highest income will be taxed at 37% with an effective rate of about 34.5%.  As a result, under current tax code you should expect to pay around $552,000 in taxes and have an after tax earnings of roughly $1.05 million, this is why you won't get much sympathy from people.  But let's assume you get a pass on this once in a decade earnings.  It isn't like you would just get a free pass though, so your tax bracket for every other year would need to be adjusted to account for this windfall.

Under the current tax system you pay roughly 11% effective rate on $60k for 9 years and then 34.5% for your big earnings year, this adds up to roughly $611,000 in taxes over 10 years.  If we adjust your tax bracket for those 9 years of lower income to match your new average income you will pay at 19.6% all ten years for a total tax bill of roughly $420,000 (actually $419k and some change, but 420...).  The difference you feel is ""gutting"" you is only $191,000, in a year that you make $1.6million."

for a below average mpg car, this was still a tax hike, never  mind a normal car or a car that someone would actually call energy efficient.

the model ultimately charges everyone more money than what they are currently paying, and obfuscates this hike by simply being a different model.

>And there are a fuckload of passthroughs set up specifically to get that break for people making big income. Nobody making big income would forego it.

you're saying that, but that's not exactly how things work. when you pass through the businesses income as yourself, you have to pay the self employment tax (and your individual tax rate) on every dollar that comes in. if you're making small money, not a big deal.

once you start actually making money though, it makes a lot more sense to be taxed like a corporation and have the company taxed on its profits, and then have the company pay you a salary that you are then taxed on. this enables the business to do various tax benefited spending like a 401k match.

the break even point where it makes sense to stop doing pass through is typically around $80k/year. either way though, the point is that this is going to impact all of those 1 person businesses where they're running a company out of their home and setup an llc, and most of those people being negatively impacted are absolutely the people biden is promising won't see their taxes increased.

i believe you’re talking about people who are at poverty levels?  where if they make $1000 more they loose their $1200/mo in housing allowance?  (made up numbers for the example).  this is a “stocks” subreddit.  99.99% of us are not in this situation.  

for us, the short answer is: if you make more money, you will have more money in your pocket to buy hookers n’ blow or shoes for orphans.   whatever floats your boat, i won’t judge."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It's based on 2019 or 2020 tax filings. So they would go back into the past to take a day off the previous year to make exactly the same amount of money they would have made if they didn't do that? Or they were omniscient and knew this bill was coming and what the cutoff would be and they planned ahead to make less that year so they would get a one time $1,400? Sure, maybe.
Even if that were the case, does anyone care someone took 1 or 2 days less work for the whole year to get an extra $1,400? If that's really where your priorities are, to get an extra day off, then why would we stop them from doing that? It's not your business what they do with the money..."

They were voted out. By a wide margin. Trump incited an insurrection and solicited voter fraud to fight the election results. When reality prevailed, the remaining $1,400 passed, without a single republican vote in either house of Congress.

So yes, Trump pushed for it at one point. Now how did it actually get through, and what were the barriers? What were his actual concerns and priorities, and when push came to shove, what was REALLY important to him?

No they wouldn't want to but they will have to if it becomes the law. I was just saying shorting is their bread and butter. That's how they make their money. So, they will need to make more money to pay more taxes. Do you not understand how taxes work?

03/16/2021,stocks,">The extra 50% of self-employment tax is deductible for passthroughs. As are a shitload of expenses ordinary employees can't use.

this isn't about ""ordinary employees"". it's about the fact that single person llc's typically make way less than $400k/year, and biden claims people making < $400k won't have their taxes raised. raising taxes on llc's IS raising taxes  on people making < $400k.

you can argue that it's a small percentage of the population, but you can't argue that it doesn't violate what biden is promising.

> And poor people drive more fuel-efficient cars, so a tax based on the population's average miles driven is a discount to them.

perhaps you should re-check your math on that, because it doesn't add up.

the more fuel efficient your car is the more of a tax hike the mileage model is for you. the model literally punishes people for having more fuel efficient vehicles."

What they “go off of” is just a way to estimate who gets how much. The final credit is calculated when you file.

All I said was the stimulus has a steeper cliff than is ideal.  I didn’t pass judgement whether that mattered, not sure why you are all hot and bothered about who’s business it is.

The post I replied to was about how tax brackets don’t have cliffs, and I chimed in that the stimulus is ironically unlike regular tax brackets."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes, and private companies that become overly bureaucratic fail over the long term.

Are you just saying they need to have more income to offset the losses from the taxes? Because you worded that very weirdly originally and I didn't catch what you were trying to say."
03/16/2021,stocks,"The Trump tax cuts were permanent for corporations and the wealthy but were designed to expire for the middle class. This was done by Trump and the GOP to manipulate people like you. Give a little tax break that expires right after the next election, so if you lose power they can blame the coming increase that they created on the other side that is in power. Then obstruct any possible solution so it can't be fixed and again blame others. 

Just like how when the GOP complains about the deficit with Democrats in power, then the second they have power they increase it rapidly. 

Somehow people keep falling for it."

The government maintains my property? Roads are paid for via fuel taxes, power/water/sewage is paid via your utility bills. legal system need funding but via income taxes? No, they can certainly tax sodas or something to pay for that. disaster relief can be paid for via another consumption tax of some sort, it’s a lack of ideas that leads to the income tax needs. The US survived until 1918 or so without a tax on income, they paid for a wars and many other things via other taxation. Income taxation was implemented because Karl Marx was very popular at the time and his Communist Manifesto had propagated the ideas the central banking and progressive income taxation was the answer. 
As I said, they spend to much, and then rely on income taxes and central bank printing to cover the rest."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Also, the government gives oil companies subsidies to and then reduces their taxes. The major banks get subsidized loans that reduce their interest rates below 0%. Then tax personal incomes, how about they reduce those subsides? What about farming? There are many many things they do that wastes your money, then complain you don’t pay enough.
 
Corporations used to be illegal in the states, it wasn’t till JD Rockefeller got a charter for Standard Oil that these Corps started popping up, a charter is supposed to be reviewed every 5 years, at what time do we quit bailing out failed Charter Corporations with income taxes dollars?

There are many ways, the idiots who can’t stop spending can’t think of a way to reduce spending? Can’t think of a way to eliminate income taxes? 
They think of everything under the sun to spend on, they think of everything under the sun to Tax, but they can’t do the opposite? They absolutely can!!!"

While all investment sources should be taken with a grain of salt, at least SeekingAlpha allows for comments to push back on some of the ideas and cases made by the author. Ideally you always look at multiple sources and try to draw your own conclusions from the source data.

If others have sources they recommend please feel free to drop them below, thanks."
03/16/2021,stocks,"In general, don’t trust most of the stuff you read about stocks online. Especially the material that gets syndicated through Yahoo or Apple News. A lot of it is automated garbage—pre written paragraphs that pop up in response to common market scenarios, with the numbers plugged in by computer. Then there is other stuff clearly in support of pump and dumps, or stuff clearly just written for clicks. 

Do yourself a favor and first learn which sources you can somewhat trust. The pros are not reading investor place."
03/16/2021,stocks,Interesting. I will see if I can add them to my The Motley Fool blocking Google Chrome Extension https://github.com/tagticians/motleyfoolblocker_chrome_extension
03/16/2021,stocks,"This is why you spend your time and energy continuously seeking to improve your own abilities to do research, rather than trying to find someone to do it for you."
03/16/2021,stocks,If any publication was actually 'good' at stock advice they would be the only game in town.

03/16/2021,stocks,Add Motley Fool to that list
03/16/2021,stocks,"Their infomercial popped up as an ad on my tablet - never heard of them or this Naveiller guy who was talking - I was like ""this is pretty smooth...has to be a scam..."""
03/16/2021,stocks,But the articles are always so informative! I love reading “Why <insert ticker> stock popped/took a nosedive today” every time I look up a symbol
03/16/2021,stocks,"I personally like [investopedia.com](https://investopedia.com)

Sometimes I'll put in ""retail stocks quarter 1 2021 investopedia"" and their link will pop up with some analysis of stocks in that sector. 

Then I go on think or swim platform, look at summary on whether or not its a good buy, scroll down and check net profit margins first than all the other financials. 

If things hit that box then I am golden. 

The first stock that I did this with made me find LOB... got in at 31.. now its 64.99."
03/16/2021,stocks,"How about Barron’s. Of course, everything must be taken with a grain of salt, but I generally liked the articles content, though not always agreed with the arguments authors deliver."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Marketwatch, business Insider. Motley. All the same FuD machines"
03/16/2021,stocks,"You have to treat market research the same way you would the regular media and politics. You know there’s going to be a lot of spin and bullshit, but the facts are the facts. If a company has a forward PE ratio of 12; that’s a fact. You can use that information to help make a decision. But if you just believe every site that says “buy these 20 stocks” yes, you will get screwed."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Seeking Alpha, Zacks, Simply Wall Street, and of course my TD Ameritrade analysis. There is no one ""go-to"" site or silver bullet to screen a stock perfectly. You have to do your own analysis. People do more analysis on buying a TV or phone than they do on their investment decisions, unfortunately. Read Lynch and Buffet. ""One Up On Wall Street"" albeit dated still has incredibly relevant information. ""The Warren Buffet Way"" by Hagstrom is another one to add to your library."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Story time: $PLUG was at 12, and I had 50 call options in the money. Read a scary article on InvestorPlace about how PLUG was a really bad stock. Believed them and some old 40 contracts . I’ve exercised the 10 contracts and hold 1000 shares of PLUG.

Have studiously avoided InvestorPlace - they’re toxic"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I agree 1000%. I challenged them by replying to a few articles about Fisker. They are pro a company in one article , then the next day some other useless , talentless person writes an opposite article. They should be shut down"
03/16/2021,stocks,"My rule of thumb. If a stock is headline news on any website, you are too late to the party."
03/16/2021,stocks,"to be fair, nothing published on an official site should be read for anything other than entertainment value. Was laughing my ass off at some boomer articles on MarketWatch... reddit has a lot of bad advice and DDs.... and almost every time, if it's bad, you scroll down and see a 500 upvoted counter pointing out their flaws. Sometimes it makes sense, even with the flaws (RKT made me a lot of money off a bad DD, cause the base argument worked, just half the stuff he said was BS)... reddit is for people who are willing to look into things and find out if what someone is saying has merit and invest accordingly. Published articles are for boomers who want someone to tell them where to put their money."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Listen to earnings calls, learn to read financials, get it straight from the horses mouth. These analysts are just like me and you - humans with bias. Listen to what management is telling you and look at their track record. Are they beating estimates? Are they making timelines and keeping them throughout the year? Does the CEO/MGMT team vibe with you and do you believe what they say? The best DD you can do is go to the companies website, click the ""investor"" tab, and download what they have and read it. You will likely walk away feeling better about your picks when you know the trajectory of the company as it comes from the company itself. Then you can make a decision whether or not what they're saying holds water in terms of the value proposition to you in relation to the stock price."
03/16/2021,stocks,Tom yeungs articles are clownish lol
03/16/2021,stocks,Good call
03/16/2021,stocks,"That site is a cesspool of charlatans and snake-oil salesmen. 

All of them are crooked assholes that need to be prosecuted for criminal activity."
03/16/2021,stocks,"What I have been doing is whenever I add a new news source into my RSS feed (I know, I am old), I bookmark a few articles that come out of that new news source but I don't follow their advice.

At the end of the trading day, I check the articles and see if they were right. I keep doing it for a week so to get a feel of the news source.

It's not a bulletproof ""DD"" but it helps.

Did the same for Yahoo Finance and their track record is terrible."
03/16/2021,stocks,Thanks for the tip.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the heads up.  I try to avoid all these online stock analysts/advisor except I did try out brownstone research where they promote their main guy Jeff Brown.  From my experience their company research is solid but the technical analysis is quite lacking.  I feel their stock recommendations are average and their portfolio is too big.  Then they tend to talk about the winners and conveniently forget to address the losers.  It can be a good source of information as they provide mid level research into company’s in tech, bio-tech, early stage, and SPACs; so if you like to read they do provide plenty of researched material.  However, I don’t think they provide enough technical analysis on the stocks to justify their positions.  Same as many have mentioned earlier, better to do your own research then cross check and take recommendations with a grain of salt. Good luck 👍"
03/16/2021,stocks,Yet somehow Motley Fool gets three stars for their house sh!t
03/16/2021,stocks,"There all garbage. They get ""tips"" from hedgefunds alot of time with about stocks that they want to move favorably. Honestly some users on reddit when they write some amazing DD that makes sense and I and check there research. I usually follow them or keep an on on what they are talking about."

Clearly trying to pull some BS."
03/16/2021,stocks,I wouldn’t trust any of them.
03/16/2021,stocks,All those sites are scam but I saw an analysis that said if you followed investorplace’s buying recommendations that they outperformed seekingalpha and all of the other blogs by a lot. I don’t use any of them but thought it was interesting.
03/16/2021,stocks,same goes for Motley fool. Good post btw.
03/16/2021,stocks,"oh, i just saw a long youtube pre-roll ad from their founder. thanks for sharing your opinion."
03/16/2021,stocks,"seeking alpha is terrible as well. a bunch of amateur analyst are given megaphones to talk about stocks. and this goes without saying, they’re wrong most of the time."
03/16/2021,stocks,Never use any website that just published articles as DD.  Do your own digging into companies. What sub is this?
03/16/2021,stocks,LMAO those trustpilot reviews are obviously a brigade. I don't give a shit about Investorplace but it takes only two seconds to realize that 90% those reviews aren't the least bit legitimate and are written by salty bois throwing shade at anyone who disagrees with them. Ffs most of those accounts have never written a review before.
03/16/2021,stocks,thoughts on finbox? [https://finbox.com/](https://finbox.com/)
03/16/2021,stocks,"Wait, so you say to look at multiple sources to get different perspectives, but you're calling InvestorPlace a scam because they publish different perspectives?  

Dude, the business model for Investor Place, Seeking Alpha, and Motley Fool is: publish a wide variety of research, sometimes contradictory, to gather email addresses and market people paid products. That's how these sites make money.  

Edit: In this thread: intelligent investors who are just now figuring out how marketing works. Just because a business sells a thing, that doesn't make the business or the thing ""bad."""
03/16/2021,stocks,"FAKE NEWS!!!    It’s all opinions & manipulation.     They have the platform that pops up on google, but they are just writers, ( NO DIFFERENT THAN ANYBODY ON THIS SUB).   We all can do DD & guess how a Stonk will perform.  
Me, I BUY ONLY STONKS I LIKE !!   Regardless of what any publication says about it.
Investor place writer Matt McCall is a sissy douchebag who manipulates stocks daily.

03/16/2021,stocks,The most click baits I encounter (on Yahoo) is from Barrons. But I'd never known it's from Barrons until I actually clicked on it. Very annoying.
03/16/2021,stocks,That’s a very specific extension! Love it I’ll take a look

03/16/2021,stocks,"Yes similar vibes, MF has been around longer and with that a slightly better reputation but not by much."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Motley Fool the spam bot-tweet on Yahoo Finance? For sure. 

Motley Fool paid services like Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers? 100% worth the money. Both services have lots of well written due diligence, and have honest research behind their picks. Not saying you can’t find the same stocks on your own, but I’ve found gems in MF’s paid services that I would’ve skipped."
03/16/2021,stocks,It was already there
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't see the problem with the fool.


There are multiple authors and everyone of them is entitled to their opinion.


The fact that a site has contrary opinions *makes it good* if you ever read what you wanted to hear you can't make informed decisions"
03/16/2021,stocks,"100% of YT ads on investing are scams. Run a mile. They are all based on the same ruse “I made a million, you can too, just do what I did, send me money and I’ll tell you”. 

It’s like the old cliche “buy my book - how to make a million and I’ll tell you how!” You buy the book and it explains how to sell a book on making millions. 

It should be fairly obvious to most these are scams. Don’t waste your time or money with any of them. Any advice you get is either repackaged investment advice 101 or straight up scam systems. 

Any ad with someone next to a sportscar or by a big house are complete scam garbage designed to separate fools from money. 

There is a ton of free material available out there, just be careful you know the source and it’s credible, for any “educational” materials being presented. 

By now it should be clear “retail investors” are not being invited to join Wall Street’s big table, retail investors (dumb money) are being served as entree. And the entire financial media is set up to help them free you of your money. EVERYONE on CNBC and the other financial channels is there to enrich their sponsors at your expense. 

Not paranoia, just practical and common sense."
03/16/2021,stocks,Investopedia is how I found TPL and PXD which have been carrying my portfolio the past 2 months.

03/16/2021,stocks,Any news sources you can recommend?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Depends on who you pick on Seeking Alpha and what your purpose is.  If you are looking for stock tips for immediate action SA is so-so to terrible like most every other analyst.  I use SA to uncover new stocks I never heard of.  Then the DD begins not ends.  Usually the DD takes at 15 - 20 hours up to 40 hours to narrow a group of 10 stocks down to 1 or 2 that are truly great.  


Reading BT you get a good feel for REIT's and occasionally stumble across gems.  BT has acquainted me with more stocks that I have purchased than any other SA writer.  Reading Rida is a very much hit or miss proposition.   After awhile you find the authors that fit your investing style.  Mine is steady growth while paying a healthy dividend.  Your results may vary from mine."

03/16/2021,stocks,"There really aren't any. Bloomberg and Motley Fool are susceptible to the same influences and practices.

03/16/2021,stocks,"Honestly Reddit investment and finance subs are probably your best sources for unbiased info, DD and leads.

03/16/2021,stocks,"I think Barron’s is pretty good. I got a subscription this year for $52, which isn’t a bad price ($1 per week). They publish articles every day and the research is decent. At the very least, it will keep you up to date with what’s going on in the market. Every January they publish their top picks for the year, and they typically perform very well. Just my 2 cents."
03/16/2021,stocks,"nowhere. Definitely nowhere syndicated... reddit is decent, you can scroll down and see people debating what they said one way or the other. Then you have to \*gasp\* do research, decide which side you think is right and put your money where you think it should go. If you're just looking for someone to tell you 'buy this stock, it will do well' and follow it blindly.... don't, there is nowhere to go to get that. A lot of reddit posts are BS, all syndicated articles are BS. If you aren't going to do the work to sift out the BS and find the good moves, just dump your money in a standard interest bearing, this world isn't for you."

03/16/2021,stocks,"* Start with primary sources. If you like a company, spend more time reading about it in its 10Qs and 10Ks than on reddit. Those are where the company leadership goes on the record and is accountable for what they say to investors. 
* Learn about price ratios (I like p/s best, but p/e, p/b, and p/fcf also have value depending on the situation). Use those to compare similar stocks within an industry or sector the way people use price per square foot to compare real estate when they shop for a house.

The skill of picking good investments and the skill of convincing people to give you money to invest are, well, two different skills.

Certain stocks are riskier. PLUG , six months ago did not attract the same attention it does now. When there’s not much concrete information on a company any opinion published in media ( and featured on Yahoo finance) could impact our decision making. 

The OP’s point was about the untrustworthiness of InvestorPlace."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Anything I'll say it'll get downvoted, and rightly so because you can always find an example of a news source that f'ed up. There isn't one that you can follow blindingly.

One rule is that I am always wary of articles that mention Reddit and WSB when they are pushing a stock, but I personally have not seen such sentiment in my Reddit newsfeed. The more frequently a news source writes this type of articles the less credibility seems to have.

You should just do this ""DD"" on the news sources you follow. Bookmark just the articles that mention stocks that you like and you would feel comfortable buying and then see how they did at the end of the day. See which news source strikes out more often than not."

2021-03-16 04:04:18,stocks,"The TechnoKing and Master of Coin So, today Tesla (TSLA) submitted an official filing to the FTC stating that Elam Musk (CEO) will now be called the Techno Master and his CFO will be called the Master of coin.

So, dose any one reading this think that this will help Tesla’s stock go up? Or is Elam slipping back into his eccentric ways again and might scare sensible investors away.

I think with his recent purchase of bitcoin he may be trying to identify with the interest of millennials.

The changing of his title is in line with appealing to and identifying with the growing army of fearlessness millennial investors.

This may be a play to try to attract the Game Stock (GME) stock investors that has been defiantly bolstering the stock for over a week.

A very large percentage of millennial investors are members of [r/wallstreetbets](/r/wallstreetbets). Game Stock (GME) for weeks have had the most mentions in the wallstreetbets community where Tesla (TSLA) is tied for second and Third place with Palantir Technologies (PLTR).

See the below link to a graph of top mentions in the wallstreetbets community:

[reliantdatastorage.com/Images/WallStreetBetsTracker.bmp](https://reliantdatastorage.com/Images/WallStreetBetsTracker.bmp)

“Power to the players” is Game Stop’s slogan which is very appealing to millennials, many of which have used the slogan as a battle cry when “Taking on the hedge funds.” This is a battle that has been raging since January 13th and caught public attention when the Stock reached as high as $400.00 a share on January 27th.

With the CEO and CFO of Tesla (TSLA) now called the TechnoKing and Master of Coin respectively Elam Musk may increase Tesla’s (TSLA) mention in the wallstreetbets community. This may be an ingenious move by first purchasing bitcoin that is so popular with millennials, and then choosing gaming names to be used as official company titles to become popular with millennial. If he is successful, Tesla (TSLA) will be able to tap into the projected $200 Billion dollars that millennials will invest into the markets throughout the rest of the year.

Game Stock is cool and now so is Tesla.

Through this latest phase, the company has invested in additional options that allow shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.


Schneider has expanded its technology lineup of Schneider FreightPower, first announced mid-year 2020, to help shippers save time and increase their access to capacity. The company rolled out the accompanying app to carriers in Fall 2020.

Through this latest phase, Schneider FreightPower aims to provide shippers with options to manage their businesses right at their fingertips. The digital marketplace allows shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.

“Our goal is to make Schneider FreightPower the digital access point for services and solutions for both shippers and carriers,” said Mark Rourke, president and CEO of Schneider. “Shippers of all sizes come to us with their toughest transportation challenges, and we are solving them faster than ever before. That means our customers get more value – and get more done in a day.”

Schneider FreightPower offers access to tools such as:Instantly quote and bookFreight visibility 24/7 (load in process, last location, pickup and ETA), including email notifications (pickups, deliveries, and specific order completion)Access to load documentsReal-time reporting


“Schneider FreightPower is an exciting, new way to differentiate Schneider and connect to small shippers and carriers which represent a $1.2 trillion segment of the transportation market,” said Rourke. “We are giving shippers time, solutions and the best at what we deliver— access to full Schneider capabilities and options. It’s all about improving capacity, so shippers can do business better than ever before,” said Rourke.

2021-03-16 00:49:55,stocks,"Struggling with understanding closing out an option I spent a while reading thru the lessons before purchasing my first option and it wasn't very clear. I purchased a call under the impression that when you close it out you are essentially profiting the difference. So let's say it's a 20$ strike and the stock is at 50$. I thought that you would simply close this out and make 30$ a share x 100 then subtract the fee to buy the option in order to calculate total profits. 

I'm looking into closing the option and I click on ""exercise option"" and it literally makes you buy 100 shares which really sucks because you need the funds free right then to buy 100 shares, but wtf like why do I need to do this when obviously the plan is to instantly sell them? This severely limits the stocks available. 

I didn't do a GME option, but just for an example because they are pretty expensive. If I bought a GME option at 65$ x 100 then I already have 6500$ tied up, but then when I actually go to close it out and make a profit, I then need to purchase 100 shares at say 250$ each (let's say the stock is at 300$) which means I need 25,000$ in my account or I can't make my profit, then turn around 1 second later and sell the 100 shares at 300$ for 30,000$.  Basically the 25,000$ is pointless because after 1 minute it's no longer needed at all so why can't they have a system where you close it out at the market price and just get the difference / profit?

My case was a GE option, I did a 13.50 strike because I also own 60 shares of GE purchased at 13.10 last week. The logic behind this is that if GE keeps going up then I sell those shares and make a profit which offsets the loss of the option, but if it goes down then the option makes money and I just keep holding those shares. I wasn't really sure which way this stock would move tbh, we had bad news, then good news and it's kind of funky right now. I know it's not enough shares to really make this worth it, but I wanted to do something that felt relatively safe for my first option, plus it could drop.

I did the option on RH which has less $$ on it, but my GE purchase is on my main account  which is Schwab. Not wild about having to move money to RH just to close the option (if it becomes profitable) and then instantly send it back to my main account.

I really hope that I am missing something obvious here, but this is how it looks when you go to RH and start to exercise it."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Read about the following terms and it should answer everything:

- buy to open
- sell to close
- exercising an option
- what do you lose by exercising an option and why people don't normally do that
- extrinsic value / instrinsic value"
03/16/2021,stocks,">but wtf like why do I need to do this when obviously the plan is to instantly sell them?

Some people end up keeping the 100 shares so they have a position in the stock. 

>If I bought a GME option at 65$ x 100 then I already have 6500$ tied up, but then when I actually go to close it out and make a profit, I then need to purchase 100 shares at say 250$ each (let's say the stock is at 300$) which means I need 25,000$ in my account or I can't make my profit,

You don't need to exercise options to realize a gain. 99% of options don't get exercised. When an option's premium goes up, you can sell it for a profit."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Oh boyyy, be safe !"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Can you always sell to close, or does there have to be a buyer looking for that exact option?"
03/16/2021,stocks,This is why it is important to check the volume AND open interest BEFORE buying an options contract.
03/16/2021,stocks,In that senario I would probably buy the shares. 7 is about the low to me. 20 is probably best case. 700 is better than paying double to hold the shares
2021-03-16 00:45:03,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 15, 2021. Please enjoy! Stocks rallied on Monday after a choppy day, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) closing at new record levels. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered some lost ground as market participants continue to balance optimism regarding economic growth against rising Treasury yields.

Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to hover near one-year highs at 1.607%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, “The pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.” 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital in order to fuel their growth and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.

In other news, Novavax (NVAX) recently announced [drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK showed the inoculation was 96.4% effective ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0)against the original strain of the coronavirus. Analyses also showed the vaccine was 86.3% effective against the variant of the coronavirus circulating in the UK, and 55.4% effective against the variant circulating in South Africa.

03/16/2021,stocks,"the Ark ETFs are gonna come down from their sky-high levels. they're gonna pop like a balloon. 

10% in a cannabis ETF is nuts IMO. a 3-d printing ETF seems extremely narrow. 

I'd trim those speciality/sector positions to a max of 5% each, and add some broad international, and mid/small cap exposure. there's an awful lot of trend chasing here.

do you know what the top performing stock of the last 20 years is? Monster Beverage. not IT. not semiconductor. not cannabis. not next generation tech. 

Monster Beverage has outperformed Apple and Amazon. 

Dominos Pizza has outperformed Amazon. look it up.

edit: that semiconductor ETF has an average PE ratio over 30 and PB is almost 8. holy crap that's a lot of overpriced stocks..."

That's the price of admission these days .  

- the semiconductor backlog offers pricing power.
- the cost of entry is a shield against competition.
- the uniqueness of some of these companies justified a good part of the markup.
- the timing of market development (5G, autonomous vehicles...) places unique opportunities on these firms.

Just to be fair, I agree, 50-80 PE is for fools, or geniuses. Time sorts them out.

But the ETF route is a bit safer than a retail individual.. he's hiring a professional team to manage that part of his portfolio, and *the luxury is THEY sit there all day* while he couldn't possibly do that.  Something happens fast, they act without amateur decisions getting debated.

Low PE is for commodity issues, not to be expected among the innovators."

This is a cross-over of my previous post. If you missed it, here's the link on r/stocks  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb\_this\_weeks\_recap\_3122021\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/)  


This is a healthy retracement, we were not respecting the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour and hourly chart, and were in the overbought territory on the RSI. Everything else is falling into place, we are looking good.  


Although I myself was excited to see $BB in the $12 range premarket and in the morning, I myself was wondering if we were about to see a blow-off, it looks like AMC ruled the day today.    


Average volume daily today too which is nice to see, probably some profit-taking as we are up 40% from the bottom at 8.83 which is fine by me. People can take their pennies if they wish, I'm more into the long game and swing trading ain't really my jam.

Continue accumulating and holding, we are looking extremely strong and this pullback was very very healthy.   


From all aspects of technical analysis standpoint, this is an absolute screaming buy.  
From a fundamentalist's view, those who know the sentiment, the deals, the products, and the history, this is a screaming buy.  
From a speculatory view or the ultra-long like 2-3 years down the road, this is a screaming buy.  


Think of this stock as smoking a brisket or making a nice prime rib roast. We want this baby to cook low and slow, or in another way set it and forget. If you do that you'll get the tastiest, juiciest reward.   


Take care."

The timeframe is often out of control though, for example political, economical, societal, geopolitical factors might push everything put 1-2 years. That hurts you when you have options, you have to start rolling out etc. If you have shares you just wait it out.

2021-03-16 00:07:34,stocks,"What do YOU include in your DD to understand a company's future?  Hi everyone,

Some background: I'm relatively new to investing, almost 3 months into it at 22 years of age. My goal is to invest in both promising growth stocks and consistent ETF's/stocks. I'm currently reading the Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham. I'm looking to gain more information on DD's to invest better, and in the future start posting my DD's here for critique from others to refine my methods.

When I analyze stocks to get into, I first look into the sector: Gold, Oil, Software (infrastructure), Consumer staples, etc. I then make a shortlist of 5-6 companies to look into with more detail (usually the bigger players). Next, I perform a full fundamental analysis on these companies, analyzing common objective metrics such as earnings, income, growth, dividends, financials, balance sheets, and some subjective numbers such as analyst sentiment, price targets, intrinsic value calculators etc. Sometimes, I look into some technical analysis on a weekly basis, eg: MACD, RSI. I should note I'm not looking to day trade.

I'm wondering how you smart people on here complete the picture. All the information I analyze currently only describes (for the most part) how the company has fared in the past. I'm looking to gain more insight on a given company's or industry's future. How do you guys get ""reliable"" forecasts? Do you look at \*all\* news regarding a company, or do you focus more on financial/goals/announcements? How do you weigh objective past financial data over future sentiment?

**\*TLDR\*** If I were to frame my question concisely: After studying a company's past and present, how do you analyze its future (semi) objectively while minimizing speculation? Do you rely on forecasts? News?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I personally try to understand the competition and sector well enough to know how they have, are and will continue to make money.  
Then I look at the moat - reputation, customer satisfaction, management.  
Then I do a DCF valuation to actually gauge at a price range. My margin of safety is within growth rates predicted - I use a ""pessimistic"" one (10-15% less than what I calculate)

And if it's trading near or below that price, then I start looking at other stuff - P/E, healthy cash flow statements, RoE, RoA, RoC. If something is off compared to the competition, I take note and think before I buy. Most people always start with relative valuations - P/E, P/B, P/S, EV/EBITDA - I don't like/feel confident starting there, but I do finish with some of it to find weird stuff. For example I'm DCA-ing into Costco at these levels, but am well aware that it's forward P/E is way higher than everything else.  


And as always my disclaimer - we'll know if my methods are right in 20+ years."

Super awkward market at the moment on any historic metric. So, take small bites at things even if you are 100% confident. Get on a brokerage (or whatever you like) that gives you access to full analyst reports and read them vs just looking at analyst PTs. For companies you like, put in the time to be on the various investor calls (you can be on many of these even if you don’t own a position).

03/16/2021,stocks,"Some foreign companies are listed on foreign exchanges, but don’t want to go through the trouble to list on American exchange. So, they trade on the OTC, either as a regular share (a “foreign ordinary,” ending with an F), or as an ADR (ending with Y). For an ADR, an institution (eg, a big bank) sells you a portion of their holding.

So, that’s why it’s on OTC. It is not nearly as sketchy as penny stocks that trade OTC; ADRs are usually reputable big companies, like Volkswagen. That said, I believe there can still be some complications relative to regular stocks, including lower volume traded and questions about how foreign taxes get taken out, which I forget the answer to."
2021-03-15 23:36:29,stocks,"Very little love for COTY I see very little love across the many many subs for this company yet it has and continues to be a fantastic little earner for me.

I will be upfront and say I am into for a some thousands. Not a lot but a decent percentage of my portfolio and I topped up twice since I first came across it. 

The first time I spotted this company was around November (maybe October). It sold off it’s factories to battle against Covid.

The sell off and then subsequent deals in 2021 along with clever marketing have kept it in the headlines, most recently its sustainable fragrance production and its share price has rebounded (its share price is still below its pre Covid price). 

It also almost dabbled with the meme stock crowd but thankfully was quickly forgotten when the craziness around GME went from crazy to buck daft. 

It’s still got a bit to go and I’m absolutely not saying this company is going to continue to grow in the way it has but it has 3x since I first spotted it and continues to grow. Could see it getting to $14/15 easily before plateauing. Not huge gains but as I said at the start, a nice little earner.

Costco believes it can slash costs by bringing production in house, saving up to 35 cents per bird.

It has already done the same with hot dogs.

03/16/2021,stocks,It's weird how often this stock gets pumped here bc the financials (eg PEG ratio) aren't as attractive compared to their competition. Costco won't be a buy for me until it drops below 300.
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm waiting for my stimmy to buy it!
03/16/2021,stocks,It's just not growing fast enough for a swing trader. Long hold is the optimal strategy with Costco.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don't like Costco being touted as a reopening stock. From my experience they never closed down. They were an essential business and probably sold more through the pandemic, not less. I can't see how reopening helps them beyond what they've already done."
03/16/2021,stocks,This thread is the opposite extreme to the guys at r/wallstreetbets...
03/16/2021,stocks,"Long term, it is solid with a huge moat. The price is fair because of its potential.
They haven’t been expanding aggressively but they can easily do so if they want to take on the risks. Certainly a safe company in the long term."
03/16/2021,stocks,People who work there seem genuinely happy. Costco recently raised the starting wage for US workers to $16. Minimum wage in my state is $7.25 fwiw. They are experimenting with curbside pickup and their online sales room to run.
03/16/2021,stocks,Why would them raising wages make you buy?
03/16/2021,stocks,Costco’s unwillingness to expand their online presence will be their downfall.  B&M is dying fast. COVID or no COVID
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah they raised their minimum wage to $16 but took away the $2 an hour covid pay that all employees were getting. Cheap sobs
03/16/2021,stocks,"Just an FYI, they are now comping against Pandemic buying so expect growth to slow to the normal 8-10% and warehouse comps to be slightly positive or negative this quarter. Wouldn't be surprised if the stock goes below $300 once the next couple earnings are lack luster compared to previous quarters"
03/16/2021,stocks,I've been buying it on its way down several times
03/16/2021,stocks,Also they are micromanage the hell out of hours for employees going to lead to more work load. It's going to be hell for the employees.
03/16/2021,stocks,I posted the other day about COST and WMT. Both are in a dip. They appear to always drop at the beginning of the year. Load up on both with stimulus coming and great long term prospects for growth. I prefer to ship at Costco but a lot Walmart.
03/16/2021,stocks,I agree that it seems a little overpriced to be honest but I think their expansion into e-commerce is still ongoing. One to keep an eye on to be honest.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I really like Costco, but so does everyone. I think the price is way too high"
03/16/2021,stocks,I’ll pour one out for anyone still holding Costco in a few months
03/16/2021,stocks,"Bottom line: For LT investors looking for a safe and solid stock, Costco is perfect."
03/16/2021,stocks,Because it’s overvalued...
03/16/2021,stocks,"As a customer, I love the company/business (everything about it). I've had a membership for 15 years and will keep with them another 15+.

As an investor, I want shares but I don't like the current valuation."
03/16/2021,stocks,I keep seeing Costco posted on here every week for the past few months. It doesn't look that good to me. Seems a bit fishy.
03/16/2021,stocks,This stock has given me so much since I bought it. Great stock and great company.
03/16/2021,stocks,This sounds like an advert.
03/16/2021,stocks,I’m convinced. Just bought 4 shares @ $328. Go stimulus!
03/16/2021,stocks,I joined this year. You spend too much. I won’t be renewing my membership. I have a family of 5 as well. Just too much and they don’t label their isles and move stuff around. Kind of a gross atmosphere IMO
03/16/2021,stocks,I guess I’d my gf has a membership why no invest in it and see some of that back lol
03/16/2021,stocks,Nice try Cramer
03/16/2021,stocks,COST's margins are too low
03/16/2021,stocks,agreed
03/16/2021,stocks,Horrible as in cheap or expensive?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Horribly overpriced. Costco is currently 25% higher than its pre-pandemic price. EPS will DROP from here on, not increase.  You dopes are clueless."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Costco's business model is fundamentally different than both Walmart and Kroger. This really is  like comparing apples and oranges, and makes me think you don't really know what you're talking about.

First of all, COSTCO has brand loyalty unlike any other retailer. If you look up efficiency metrics (earnings per square foot/revenue per employee, etc.), this business is extremely efficient. The model of placing pallets of goods on an aisle reduces stocking times/can easily be automated. 

Costco essentially runs a subscription mode with it's Costco memberships. Costco marks up items only 15% and has a very small gross margin by design (cover employee expenses, utilities, other costs of business). ALL revenues come from their subscription model. Compare this to the 25-30% markup of Target/etc. Goods at competitors need to be priced higher due to the greater variety, employee costs, etc. These subscriptions have a 90+% renewal rate of subscription which gives COSTCO holders the most recession resistant earnings possible. Most users just auto-pay these subscriptions, so this is essentially a non-factor.

There are only 3000-4000 SKU's compared to the 100,000-200,000 at Walmart. This gives Costco unrivalled pricing power, which decreases costs, increase shareholder value, increases subscriptions, increased pricing power, decreases costs, etc. This positive feedback loop is extremely powerful. Also, Costco's able to recreate profitable items with their Kirkland brand in the same way Amazon Basic re-creates goods. This cuts out the middle-man and decreases costs even more.

Finally, almost most importantly, this bulk buying/subscription is mostly likely the least susceptible to be replaced by e-commerce. By nature, shipping 20lbs of pickles/soft drinks/etc. is much more difficult for Amazon to manage. Also, the smaller profit margins make Amazon less likely to compete directly with Costco (Why you always read about Amazon vs Walmart). This is also not to mention that Analysts predict revenues for Walmart to fall by 1.9%, whereby Costco is predicted to grow by at 6% (not that I really care for Analyst predictions).

This is beside the point, but employees also get paid more, and I feel subjectively better shopping at Costco than Walmart."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think Costco shouldn’t be value like a retailer since their business model is more similar to a subscription service company due to most of its profit coming from the membership fee.
 
They’re playing a different game from other retailers since their focus is membership renewal instead of selling goods. They also have lots of loyal customers, which other retailers have very few.
 
COST may be overpriced if you only consider the growth, but when moat is taken into consideration, the valuation becomes a lot more reasonable."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Using P/E is not a be all end all metric, like you would think"
03/16/2021,stocks,brand loyalty and the way they monetize customers is HUGELY different between Costco and Walmart though
03/16/2021,stocks,"well shit. so it's still not cheap?

guess i'll have to sell it.  

I just picked it up at $319, and if it's destined to chop around in the 330s, i'll have to cut it loose.

I was hoping it would go up to $350 in the short term."
03/16/2021,stocks,Could you elaborate on what P/R ratio is exactly and what does it tell me ? Thanks 🙏🏼
03/16/2021,stocks,"This. I’ve wanted to buy Costco for awhile ( I love big box, own BJ and WMT) but it hasn’t gotten down to a price I feel comfortable with, even with the dip. The one thing that really attracts me is the old Buffett silver bullet question. “If you could shoot a silver bullet at one of your competitors, who would it be and why”. For my BJs holding the answer is clearly Costco.

 PS I love Charlie Munger"
03/16/2021,stocks,Costco is aggressively expanding
03/16/2021,stocks,Truly.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Don't forget an expanding online business with a world of possibilities. You can bet there are bigger plans to expand their online sales, which I would argue is their biggest area for growth right now."
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm buying tomorrow just because I love their rotisserie chicken. Thank you 🐔
03/16/2021,stocks,Hot damn.
03/16/2021,stocks,The Kirkland brand is a billion-dollar brand itself.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’d love to see stand alone Costco food courts, or like a mini drive up Costco with pizza and like their top 20 skus. They are probably deep loss leaders but I’d go so often if I could just pull up and pick up pizza without going in the store everytime."

03/16/2021,stocks,It hasn’t been that low since June lol
03/16/2021,stocks,Great post!

03/16/2021,stocks,"They are happy. Which makes for happier customers, too!

Good company"
03/16/2021,stocks,Workers have more money to spend perhaps they spend there. Also increases good will. I was really just thinking that the main reason their stock dipped was due to them raising the wages. But now that that’s a little past the stock will rebound back to near where it was
03/16/2021,stocks,"They'd much rather you go inside than visit their online page, it's a main part of their business model. Costco knows if you're shopping online you're going to Amazon, but you don't go to Costco for the same reason you visit Amazon."
03/16/2021,stocks,going online would hurt their margins bigly
03/16/2021,stocks,Have you heard of market cap?
03/16/2021,stocks,"What if there were only 1k share outstanding, would $330/ still be too much?

03/16/2021,stocks,You could just cancel and get your full membership fee back.  It's part of their satisfaction perk
03/16/2021,stocks,"It's $327 per share, so you can probably take a guess."

03/16/2021,stocks,"They also have low employment turnover, which means they spend less time training and can focus on running the stores efficiently."
03/16/2021,stocks,I like BJs. They have their digital down pat. They need to find a way to win but that brand name of costco is hard to beat.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Agree with a lot of this, I've been watching COST a while and will put a chunk of my tax return into it. I worked there about 2 years, their business model and customer loyalty is everything. Their employees love their job too since they get paid so much."

03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah I understand. It’s just a bad strategy imo. B&m is going away across the board.  P/e relatively high to boot. Much better value assets out there

03/16/2021,stocks,Am Chinese. Chinese people love american shit and bargains. Chinese-Americans like me love Costco and I have basically become free advertising for them. I like the stock
03/16/2021,stocks,"Remember when walmart had just gotten started in europe. How did that go :/.

Costco has got it's work cut out for it..."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Costco does a lot of regional buying, so they probably will stock stuff unique to those stores that locals want."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Reasonable take. I also wonder how that relationship evolves over the years. Either way, they're perhaps more globally diversified than some may think: 

- 558 in United States and Puerto Rico
- 102 in Canada
- 39 in Mexico
- 29 in UK
- 27 Japan
- 16 South Korea
- 14 Taiwan 
- 12 Australia
- 3 Spain
- 1 France
- 1 Iceland
- 1 China (plans to expand)

While I wouldn't call them a growth company as they are cautiously optimistic by nature I believe that they deserve a premium for both their membership model and for being a safe ""proxy bond"" consumer staples. Last I checked they were second only to Walmart in sales. 

I'd also argue they're a good stock to own in the event we do have rampant inflation as they'll pass the costs on to customers. If we experience a ""frugal decade"" then there's the fact that they offer tremendous value. 

As an older millennial I can say we're starting families and looking to expand. Yes, many millennials have a Costco membership. 😁 

Covid and work from home trend also opens up further potential as people flock to suburbia.  

Needless to say I'm bullish and believe they're a safe place to invest for the long term."

That my company was paying for. Works for me.
Hot tip (obvious but I didn't think of it at first), when you get your end of year costco rebate, make sure to go to the conceirge desk and get your full rebate in cash and use that to pay off your card rather than what I used to do was go shopping and use my rebate and take the difference. You don't get cash back if you use your rebate to make a purchase."

03/16/2021,stocks,"This investor does, and I'll tell you why. Treating your employees well means less turnover and turnover is expensive. Take care of your employees and they'll take care of you.

If you invested $10K in Costco 3 years ago, you would have doubled your money by now. The same investment in Walmart would have gotten a 60% return.

Not to mention, Costco still has plenty of room to grow without canibalizing their other stores. The same cannot be said about Walmart."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Interesting insight, thanks for this. I wonder if there's a way to disect each retailers contractor/pro revenue versus the average homeowner and see the impact to their bottom line. On one hand it means more business, but then again if profit margins are lower than consumers maybe it's not as important as it might otherwise seem."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Good tip on the rebate.  

I guess I have a different definition of not shopping a crazy amount at Costco. It seems you spend at least $500/mo there and use the card for at least $40k annually for other purchases with that card alone."

Every Saturday, Hd giving out toy to build for kids. Used to be free event in HD, but with the pandemic, they decided to give out free toy kit.

Clearly you're just talking shit."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If everything does well in China then why did Amazon pulled out? Or Tesco the European grocery chain? 

Costco opened their first location essentially as a beta test; they want to get a sense of demand and also figure out the logistics, supply chains etc. It's been a massive success and unless you have data to prove otherwise it's safe to say they're succeeding where other foreign players aren't."
03/16/2021,stocks,"No, my costco exclusive rebate is pretty light. Yes I spend a lot on it otherwise."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Amazon treats their workers poorly, specifically on the retail side, but the customer experience isn't impacted by that.

I've interacted with Amazon staff twice in the past: Once was AWS support, and the other was to make a return. Both times, it was an absolute pleasure. Most likely, those employees were treated well.

Now, if shopping at Amazon involved going to one of their actual warehouses, I can almost guarantee that I would have a different experience than that of when I shop at Costco."
03/16/2021,stocks,Ok I’ll look up the channel. Thanks!
03/16/2021,stocks,"I get your point, but GE is a terrible comparison. Sorry lol."
03/16/2021,stocks,Calling everyone dopes and idiots because they disagree with your position (or lack there of) seems idiotic.

03/16/2021,stocks,they're racist for using their race as a credible reference for Costco and Chinese people?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Not saying anyone is racist but referring to yourself as a banana or an oreo (yellow/dark/whatever on the outside, white on the inside) is weird. This whole thread got weird."

03/16/2021,stocks,"InTheMoney is the man you want. The information is dense, but he actually explains the science and basic principles behind it all, before just throwing the greeks at you and expecting you to grasp it. Both his RH and Webull options videos are about 2hrs long but that long of time is absolutely needed. I had to come back and watch and re-watch the Webull tutorial multiple times before being able to grasp it. It may take some time, and a lot of learning and dedication on your part. But it will all start to make sense when you hear it over and over. If you have some basic questions feel free to ask! I'm still learning myself but understand all of the basic principles at this point and can confidently trade options without having to look up what certain terms mean."

03/16/2021,stocks,It's common among mainland chinese to refer that way to western-born chinese. It's not seen as racist because there is no real dynamic of power/oppression between mainland chinese and diaspora the same way there is between white/black americans.
03/16/2021,stocks,It’s weird he made a joke about his race? Lmao what is going on.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Didn’t know I had to explain my whole history. I’m ethnically Chinese and I have tons of family living in China. I know how Chinese people are as consumers and all the ingredients in the Costco recipe are a perfect fit. The middle class is only just starting to grow and they love Western imports and brands, discounts, exclusivity, random luxury brands, and free samples. The CCP is another story. If you took CCP out of the equation, I would put my life savings on Costco’s success in China"
03/16/2021,stocks,Walmart is like walking into a warzone..
03/16/2021,stocks,"Thanks a lot! I checked out InTheMoney’s video about options on Webull just now. I haven’t finished the video yet, but I’ll definitely watch it as many times as I need to to grasp the content. The guy seems pretty solid. I’ll let you know if I have any questions. Thanks for the input!"

03/16/2021,stocks,"For sure! It also helps to read about the same concepts, from different sources. He explains it one way, then you go read about it and they explain it a different way, so you get different angles on the same idea and can form a better mental image of the whole thing. A lot of it comes down to terminology as well. Once you are able to understand more and more terms, the broader and more complicated picture starts to come together better. If you can define: Call, Put, ITM, ATM, OTM, Exercise, Expiry, DTE, Strike, Underlying, The Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Rho, Vega), Open Interest, Volume, IV, IV Crush, Bid/ Ask, and Break-Even....Then you will understand 99% of the basic core concepts of options trading.  Learning those terms also goes hand in hand with learning how they all interact together. It's a lot at first but you will get it if you keep learning! And hell maybe buying a cheap call, less than $50 or $20 on a stock you like, just ONE lol, could help you see those things in action.

And before buying any calls, and even while watching videos and learning, [use this website](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html). InTheMoney will actually show it to you, but playing around with it while he's describing the different concepts, and using a real stock that you may be familiar with as an exmaple, will really help you see the differences. Set up an option with an expiry of this week (Mar 19th), then set up the same strike price out like 6 months from now (Sep 17) and see how that changes all the numbers. Things will start to click.

Good luck!"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm going to second the advice you got. Definitely sit through the whole length of the option trading intro and then move on to the greeks and IV videos. Once you feel comfortable with the basics, look at some of his strategy videos and you'll get a good idea how to limit risk and raise your probability of success.  If you use discord, his discord channel is full of helpful people also if you need help in real time.  Good luck!"

and you jumped to so yeah there's no genocide.

then I was like, cool, never once said anything about genocide"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I mean, you jumped from ""banana is a weird term"" to ""China is assimilating Muslims"" but, you know, cool"
03/16/2021,stocks,"I mean the term banana isn't weird at all. On that note, it was sarcasm to your ridiculous response that does a piss poor job of hiding your opinions."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm not hiding my opinions at all, I think China is maligned by the west in obvious agitprop tactics so that arms companies can sell more weapons to the government.

I believe these companies are going to be around in 20-30 years easily and will continue to grow as they have since early 2000's. I also think tech stocks will ultimately be a safe bet in the long run as we turn to technology for everything nowadays.

TSM: Three big buys at $58, $50, and $87. Average in the mid 60s.

(No real exit plan on those two. I'm ""diamond handing"" them, as the kids say...)

F: Just got into Ford last April and was planning to exit at 12, then 15, but Ford has grown on me and I like the investor sentiment on all things EV. I'm holding Ford. Looking for 18-20. Entry was $5-$6, so I feel like my risk here is pretty low.

ORC: (REIT) Nice monthly dividend earner. Another pandemic deal. Big buy last May around $4. At current dividend rates, my total investment here will pay for itself in 5 years. (Not factoring taxes of course.)  Also, if I do decide to sell, the divy effectively lowers my entry point. It's trading at $6 right now btw... I feel like this one is still a good buy.  It can potentially pay for itself in 7-8 years.

ERIC: Modest position here. Haven't been real good about buying dips, but I plan to. Long term 5G play.

Also long on Crypto sector. Companies change but I'm always holding some miners. I've been in and out of RIOT. Currently holding Argo Blockchain, Bitfarms LTD, Hut8 Mining, and Santo Mining Corp.  (No tickers.  I got modded for one of them..  lol)   I also acquire Ethereum directly. (Cypto and crypto miners are the most speculative portion of my long term strategy, but the one I feel has the greatest potential upside.)

That's it. The rest of my positions are a few good green days away from liquidity at any given moment. :D"

GOOG- because holding for 9 years so far, isn’t enough.

AMZN - because AWS.

SQ - because cash app, banking prospects with ethical alignment to small businesses, etc.

Somewhat risky long - PTON - newest stock for me, just recently bought on the way down, always wanted to own it.  Won’t go into detail here, but I  plan on holding for a while."

03/16/2021,stocks,Agree NIO is not a good hold short or long-term. Several things worry me about that company.
03/16/2021,stocks,"p/e is meaningless for a new company, you should look at p/s and revenue growth

which still is pricy for growgen"

You’re wrong"
03/16/2021,stocks,"And their Q3 revenue for 2020 was up 152% Y/Y
if they can keep up that kind of growth I’ll keep holding their stock and buy on dips despite a high valuation"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Pretty high.  I think NVDA shot themselves in the foot for the short term by nerfing the new stuff with regard to crypto mining.  But long term, I don't think that's really going to effect them.  I held for 5 years and will continue because I think they'll be looking better in another 5.  Still a good buy if you ask me.  (Although, I'll admit there's lower upside now.  Mainly because you just can't afford big blocks of it anymore.  ...well I can't anyway.)  For sure though if I had the money laying around, I definitely would have bought more when it dropped below 500 recently.  It was 460 just a week ago.  I knew that wasn't gonna last long.  lol"

03/16/2021,stocks,P/E way higher than Paypal. Paying a higher multiple bc it’s Jack? Na.
03/16/2021,stocks,But they are behind in other ways. For example with servicing and repair infrastructure. There are so few repair shops for Tesla cars in Europe that most big corporations do not offer Teslas as work cars (which makes up something like 60% of all new cars sold in Europe).
03/16/2021,stocks,"Agreed. TLSA power is why I'm bullish on TSLA in addition to the future of autonomous vehicle tech. I remember reading that during California's recent brown outs/back outs Tesla's charging network was unaffected due to their underlying power infrastructure. Plus their battery farm tech can play a crucial rolel in green energy adoption and have a proven track record of producing profits in a short amount of time (see Australia) with multiple projects under construction (California and now Texas). Add onto that residential solar, battery packs and the accompanying software. Tesla is not just EVs but also a green energy/utility play."
03/16/2021,stocks,"[citation needed]. Tesla is a great hype stock based on...hype. Struggling to find any objective/third party souece claiming their software is superior, seems to be quite the oposite story. That would probably explain why Tesla is bleeding marketshare in Europe like a solider lost in a WW1 trench...no end in sight."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm not saying NIO isn't viable. I'm saying battery swapping is a dead end for the mass market consumer.

I may enter NIO after they start producing cars but yeah, right now it's too risky."
03/16/2021,stocks,Yep. Folks just thought it’d pop like Tesla. Nope.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Uh, check the p/e... it's on yahoo even. You may be in at a good price, but the p/e is absurdly high. Having watched this stock for a while, it's way more volatile than other weed stocks, maybe because it's one of the few not traded on OTC. They are probably just raising awareness of this, given the thread is about stable long term holds."
03/16/2021,stocks,I didn’t have enough for NVDA - so I spent my money doubling down on Amd during the dip.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Quite frankly there’s suffocating competition, and you’re already seeing QOQ growth decline. Cashapp’s core business (peer to peer transactions) has no international expansion potential and it’s position in the US market will be precarious at best when FedNow is introduced.

Its other features are in saturated markets against competitors with inherent advantages. Cash Card has to compete against Google, Samsung, and Apple which have their services preinstalled on every phone. Their broker service competes with literally every US broker as they’re all commission free nowadays.

That leaves their tax filing service to justify a P/E of greater than 500."
03/16/2021,stocks,MO I think is a great long-term play. You are right when it gets legalization on the  federal level it will be a great bet. The big boys aren't involved yet due to federal laws. MO has the cash to wait and make a move when it is right. Not to mention a great Div. I actually Increased my position this morning.

03/16/2021,stocks,"This is a huge part of my personal bear case of TSLA. One of my friends owns one and was rear ended and it took 6 (!!!) months for them to replace the body work on the back side.

03/16/2021,stocks,"European tesla's come from America. It makes sense that there would be less cars going to europe during a global pandemic.

Supply can't keep up with demand. 

Nice try with the fear mongering though.

03/16/2021,stocks,"... They swap the battery out with a precharged one, charge yours and then give it to someone else, They don't need to stock much excess except to cover a small delay phase shift since the batteries coming in = the batteries going out. The only difference is people won't have to wait for their battery to recharge, that and the potential issues of battery renting instead of ownership with potential liabilities and such."
03/16/2021,stocks,GrowGeneration projects 2021 revenue of between $335 million and $350 million. The low end of that range reflects 74% year-over-year growth. That kind of growth rate makes those valuation metrics seem not nearly as scary. Still has plenty room to run.
03/16/2021,stocks,I don't think you could have gone wrong over the past couple of weeks with a semiconductor sector buy.  I still like UMC.  Under $9.  I'm red on it right now having bought in at 9.80.  It's red today.  I'm watching it to average down.  Anyone who thinks the semi sector is going to lag long term is nuts IMO.
03/16/2021,stocks,"So I’m gonna try to address the bill case here point by pint.

Cash App is largely targeted underbanked and unbanked people, which by definition FedNow isn’t going to touch well at all. (Also FedNow ain’t coming for two to three years, and by then market effects might box out the banks pretty damn well).

Cash Card does have to technically compete with Google, Samsung, and Apple, but those platforms will be inherently flawed and fail in comparison to Cash App due to platform exclusively. It’s in much more direct competition with Venmo here.

And I think finally you are missing the point with what Cash App is trying to do. Ultimately Cash App is competing to be the one-stop shop for financial services for poorer people.

Battery renting is a fairly attractive alternative to just pay some minor subscription to be able to swap batteries as needed. And costs the battery charger essentially nothing while they slap on a premium fee to cover all their expenses with a nice markup for profit.

Lack of widespread adoption for swapping stations - it would only be necessary for charging stations to make a minor change towards housing 
 and charging spare batteries, in time producers would realize the upside of battery standardizations which is at almost no cost to them and has high functional upside by allowing their product to benefit from battery swap compatibility which pretty much everyone would want because otherwise they get to sit around for up to an hour while they usually come out with a partial charge because who has that time?"

You haven't thought that through. No one is going to start that business without a huge volume of these cars already on the road. They can't operate at a loss and wait for the consumer to buy more NIOs.

You must back in and drive out so the efficiency of the queue is going to suck.

2021-03-15 22:45:35,stocks,"Frequency Therapeutics - A sleeping biotech giant, about to wake from its slumber **Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.**

This is not a company I came across through my general stock research. In fact, it is a company I stumbled across through my own personal health journey.

I'm expecting a significant jump in the stock price in the next week or two (possibly even in the next day or two) and so wanted to post my own due diligence for others. I am currently long on $FREQ.

**Some personal disclosure first**

As mentioned above, I came across this company through my own personal health journey. Until Frequency Therapeutics, I had never invested into biotech as I deemed it was too risky and I considered the science beyond my understanding, and to some extent still do. To put it simply, I saw no reason in investing in something I couldn't understand.

This all changed when I started to experience problems with my hearing. I currently suffer from hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis. Frequency Therapeutics' leading drug candidate aims to regenerate hearing in the human ear.

Naturally then, I am not only financially invested but also emotionally invested in this company. I want them to win and it’s only right I disclose this. The thing is, these conditions have led me down a journey towards understanding the science behind the anatomy of the human ear over the years, as well as look into why previous attempts at regenerating hearing have failed. I do not have a medical background, but I believe the amount of understanding I have accumulated over the years after having read dozens if not hundreds of peer-reviewed medical journal articles has given me an insight into an area of biotech - namely otology - that I otherwise would not have had.

So as I say, I've seen many companies come and go over the years, attempting to treat hearing loss with no success. I did not invest in any of them. So what's different this time?

My analysis will focus on five things: the leading product and how it works, how this drug is different from other companies trying to treat hearing loss, Frequency's clinical trial results so far, the team behind the product, the financials and the potential market size.

**The leading drug candidate: FX-322**

[FX-322 aims to regenerate hair cells in the cochlea.](https://www.frequencytx.com/pipeline-programs/hearing-program/) The auditory system is complex with many points of failure, but the most common cause of hearing loss along that pathway is induced by the loss of these hair cells, either due to noise exposure, age or drugs (ototoxicity). When these cells die, they are gone forever. Current treatments consist of hearing aids and cochlea implants, which simply amplify the remaining signal from the surviving hair cells. They do not replace or restore the clarity and frequencies lost by dead hair cells. These hair cells are located in the cochlea, a small membrane located behind the middle ear and in one of the most difficult-to-reach areas of the body. Treating hearing loss therefore poses not just the challenge of developing the drug, but also finding a way to deliver it to the cochlea once developed.

Interestingly, birds and some other animals are known to regenerate their hair cells, and therefore their hearing, naturally. The relevance of this will become more obvious further down below.

Until now, one of the obvious attempts at restoring hearing in the ear has been through the use of stem cells. The idea behind using stem cells, as we all know, is that a stem cell can turn into any other cell. Stem cells, however, present their own sets of challenges. As described above, there is a delivery issue. Even if one could culture a good number of hair cells from stem cells, it is very difficult to transfer them to the cochlea. Moreover, the process of injecting the cochlea would itself cause cochlea damage (and potentially hearing loss). Secondly, stem cells turned into hair cells lack the genes required to integrate fully into the the colonies of other hair cells. It would be a retro-fit, rather than a seamless fit. Thirdly, developing stem cells on a mass scale for such a big market (which I discuss further down) also presents its own challenges.

Back to FX-322.

A few years ago, researchers discovered that the cochlea is a host to what are known as progenitor cells. Progenitor cells are cells that are slightly further down the line of a stem cell, but unlike a stem cell, which can turn into any kind of a cell, a progenitor cell has a pre-determined cell “fate”, in that it can only turn into one type of cell. A man named Will McLean, co-founder of Frequency Therapeutics, discovered during his PhD that a certain progenitor cell in the cochlea - the LGR5 cell - was the progenitor cell during development (i.e. in the uterus) responsible for going on to become a hair cell. This was an important discovery, as it was not previously known “which cell became what”. These progenitor cells divide and replicate until there are enough hair cells, and the process is self-limiting in that once the 15,000 hair cells found in the human ear have been produced, the division and replication stops. This is important, because you would otherwise have a cancer risk, but this is nature we are talking about. The LGR5 cells continue to remain in the cochlea after birth, but the cell signalling required for them to continue to divide and replicate has been “switched off”. This is in contrast to birds and other animals, where the cell signalling remains.

Around this same time, another researcher, Xaiolei Yin, working in the same lab, had been doing some [research on the lining of the intestine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3951815/). Many do not know this, but the human intestine is one of the few regenerative tissues in the body - it replenishes every 5 to 7 days. Xaiolei Yin was able to show that this regeneration was down to the exact same type of progenitor cell – the LGR5 cell. The difference between the LGR5 cells in the intestine and in the cochlea was that the intestine was accompanied by something else called a Paneth cell, which provides the cell signalling required to “turn on” the LGR5 cells. No such cells exist in the cochlea. Xaiolei Yin, however, was able to show that if you used two small molecules – CHIR (a proprietary molecule) and VPA (valproic acid) – you could replicate the effect of Paneth cells on LGR5 cells in the absence of Paneth cells. [Will McLean took this idea and applied it to his cochlea research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124717301365). By applying VPA and CHIR, Will McLean was able to completely regenerate hair cells in mice and human cochlea ex vivo. Moreover, this process too was shown to be self-limiting: a key requirement in terms of cancer concerns. Finally, Will and his team were able to show that this method allowed them to regenerate 2000x more cells than previous research attempts.

In short, they were able to “switch on” the body’s innate ability to regenerate itself. This is when [Frequency Therapeutics](https://www.frequencytx.com/) was born.

Fun Fact: Will McLean used to post on reddit many years ago as PhD student while doing his research into progenitor cells and used to post regularly in hearing loss and tinnitus forums about the work he was doing in his lab.

**Previous attempts and how FX-322 is different from the competition.**

As mentioned above, previous attempts have consisted of retrofitting stem cells and other experimental approaches. Frequency does have some competition from other biotech firms, namely [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/), [Regain](https://www.regainyourhearing.eu/) and [Pipeline Therapeutics](https://www.pipelinetherapeutics.com/).

\[Imgur\]([https://imgur.com/AewCyUu](https://imgur.com/AewCyUu))

These companies have a similar approach to Frequency in that they too are trying to make use of progenitor cells but they all differ in one key way. These companies all use an approach called direct transdifferentiation, whereas Frequency Therapeutics use an approach called mitotic regeneration.

\[Imgur\]([https://imgur.com/4yzH814](https://imgur.com/4yzH814))

Using direct transdifferentiation, one can convert a progenitor cell into a hair cell. The problem is, once you do this, that original progenitor cell is gone – it has been depleted. In other words, the prospect of repeat treatment is zero. Frequency Therapeutics drug is different in that it induces the progenitor to asymmetrically divide into another progenitor cell and a hair cell, meaning that the original progenitor cell is never depleted – the equilibrium is maintained. The new hair cell then takes the place of the dead hair cell, which is absorbed and/or washed away by the body. This difference in drug philosophy has many implications, both from an effectiveness point of view and also a financial point of view, in that it allows for the same patient to receive multiple treatments if required.

If you recall, I also mentioned something above about drug delivery. The beauty of Frequency’s approach is that the procedure is extremely simple. It simply involves an injection through the eardrum using local anasthetic. The gel then diffuses from the middle ear to the inner ear through what's known as the round window, so the cochlea is never compromised. The molecules then do their thing.

So where are we now?

**Phase 1 results**

Frequency are due to release Phase 2 results any day now. All we have now to glean data from are the Phase 1 results.

I feel this is the point where most people have missed the value of this stock, in that they have totally misinterpreted the data and why this stock has gone under the radar the way it has.

Phase 1 trials are usually conducted with one thing in: safety. They rarely look into efficacy of the drug, as the sample is so small. However, Frequency did carry out some small efficacy research. At first glance, these results were somewhat underwhelming. Audiograms showed no statistically significant changes. Some 4/15 patients showed a minor blip at the very top of the audiogram – 8,000kHz – but again nothing to write home about. Furthermore, out of the 15 patients who received FX-322, only 6 showed improvements in their word recognition scores and only 4 of the 6 at a statistically significant level.

You’re probably now thinking I’ve just wasted your time. **Bear with me.**

There are a few things to note here. Firstly, audiograms only test for a range of frequencies. Humans can hear up to 20,000 Hz, but audiograms only test up to 8,000Hz – that’s less than half of the frequency range. Until recently, it had been suggested that the frequencies above 8,000 Hz were not important and of “academic interest” only, but for reasons that will soon become apparent, this is not the case at all. In any case, [check out this study.](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/47/23753) Secondly and most importantly, when one reads the actual study, it is made clear that only 6 of the 15 patients who received FX-322 had “headroom” to improve their word recognition scores. In other words, the scores of the other 9 patients were already so high, that it would be impossible to differentiate at a statistical or even clinically meaningful level whether an improvement in those high scores was down to re-test variability or the drug itself. So Frequency decided it was best to compare the 10 patients who had the headroom required for hearing improvement: 6 who received FX-322 and 4 who received placebo.

When Frequency did this, the results were staggering.

\[img\][https://i.imgur.com/pmZNvZo.png\[/img\]](https://i.imgur.com/pmZNvZo.png[/img])

Two patients saw their word scores more than double, while two other patients saw their words scores almost double. The other two patients also improved, albeit not at a statistically significant level. None of the patients who received placebo showed any such improvement.

These patients were tested and retested over more than a year and their results remained (when accounting for re-test variability). One patient did fall out of the statistically significant boundary but remained with a notably improved score.

The question then became: if these patients are improving their word scores, why are we not seeing it on the audiogram? Those investors left unimpressed by frequency’s results have suggested that either the sample size was too small while others have outright accused them of “p-hacking” (a very serious accusation). I personally believe the answer to be quite simple.

If you may recall, I said above that 4/15 patients did see a 10db improvement at 8,000 kHz. 10db may not sound like much, until you realise that the hearing loss scale is logarithmic. A 10db improvement means that sound sensitivity has improved 10-fold. But here is the pertinent point. Have a look below at the diagram of the cochlea.

\[Imgur\]([https://imgur.com/5pcsPFs](https://imgur.com/5pcsPFs))

You will notice that different parts of the cochlea are responsible for different frequencies. You will notice that the very top of the range - 20,000 Hz - coincides with an area of the cochlea called the round window. As you may recall, the round window is the entry point for FX-322. In other words, the very first cells that regenerate from the drug are in the very frequencies that audiograms do not traditionally test for. The hair cells responsible for these frequencies are also the “first to go” in human hearing, and therefore have the most amount of damage – and therefore the most amount of regeneration. This would also explain why some improvement was observed at 8,000kHz in that it was the highest frequency on the audiogram. The part of the cochlea responsible for this frequency is closer to the round window than any of the other frequencies on the standard audiogram. The idea then is that the improvement in word scores are down to improvements that cannot be measured on the audiogram. As a result, Phase 2 results are now measuring patients’ hearing using extended audiograms up to 16,000 Hz.

The problem is, this doesn't explain why improvements were not observed at lower frequencies. Frequency Therapeutics' own modelling has shown that the drug in its current dosage and form does not reach the majority of the lower frequencies measured on the audiogram:

\[Imgur\]([https://imgur.com/p8uQC5b](https://imgur.com/p8uQC5b))

This is a pharmacodynamics issue and would explain why improvements were not observed in the lower frequencies. It may, however, be resolved in Phase 2 for one of two reasons. Phase 2 is currently testing multiple doses, the idea being that not only does the drug reach deeper into the cochlea with more doses but also that, because less of the drug is likely to absorbed once the first “wave” of regeneration has occurred in higher frequencies, it means the drug will simply travel through to the lower frequencies without being immediately absorbed. It remains to be seen whether the drug will reach deeper into the cochlea, but ultimately this is something that can be improved down the line with a reformulation. Frequency only need to prove that the drug is safe, that it works in principle and that it gives a real quality of life improvement to take it to market. They can always reformulate the drug carrier - the gel - and bring an improved version a year later. We know this is possible because other companies, such as Otonomy, that are focusing on other ear-related conditions, such as Meniere's and genetic hearing loss, have developed a [sustained release delivery vehicle](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/otonomy-presents-data-on-breakthrough-ear-treatment-92658769.html) that can reach the lower frequencies of the cochlea.

As I said at the very beginning, the biggest issue is drug delivery. Frequency have not completely cracked that, but they seem to be on the right path.

**Phase 2 results**

Phase 2 results come out any day now. I believe we will see some phenomenal responses in the extended audiograms and some improvements in lower frequencies in the higher-dose cohorts. I also expect there to be some improvement if not resolution of other associated conditions, such as tinnitus. Although not mentioned in their study or above, [Frequency have been on the record saying that they have anecdotal cases of patients from the Phase 1 trial saying their tinnitus improved](https://www.tinnitustalk.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/transcript-tinnitus-talk-podcast-ep12-frequency-therapeutics.pdf). They have therefore added tinnitus as a secondary outcome measure.

**The team behind the product**

I’ve already mentioned two individuals who played a key role in developing FX-322. I now want to spend a moment talking about other people behind the company. There are many to pick from, but I will focus on just two. The first man is none other than [Robert Langer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._Langer). Why should you care about this guy? Firstly, his forehead is brighter than my future, but more importantly, he is the most cited engineer of all time, the 4th most cited individual in history and he has participated in the founding of more than 40 biotech companies, including Moderna. He is also regarded as the founder of tissue engineering in regenerative medicine. This is a seriously big name to have and I do not for a moment believe he would be [part of this](https://www.frequencytx.com/people/robert-s-langer-scd-2/) unless he believed this drug is the beginning of something special.

The other man is someone called [Carl Lebel](https://www.frequencytx.com/people/%E2%80%A2carl-lebel-phd/), their chief development officer. Carl Lebel specialises in getting drugs approved by the FDA. He knows the process inside out and is someone you want on your team if you are trying to get your drug to market. However, the most pertinent point about Carl is that until he joined the company in 2018, [he was actually retired](https://www.tinnitustalk.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/transcript-tinnitus-talk-podcast-ep12-frequency-therapeutics.pdf). It wasn’t until he saw the product and data with his own eyes that he realised this was a boat he could not miss. When one considers that it takes, on average, 10 years to get a drug to market, this was a pretty big decision to make, and not one I think Carl would make unless he was confident this drug would indeed get to the market.

**The financials and potential market cap**

Like most start-up biotechs with no drug currently on the market, Frequency is, for now, [loss-making](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/freq/financials/cash-flow). Without cash and investors, this company is as dead as the hair cells in my ears. It looks like, however, that this should not be a problem for frequency, assuming they hit their targets. Following Phase 1 results, they came to a deal with Astellas for over half a billion dollars with an [80m upfront cash payment](https://investors.frequencytx.com/static-files/bd82e199-8b2c-4c35-9929-3d7ed4cbcfc2). The deal is contingent that Frequency hit certain milestones through their clinical trials and in return Astellas get the rights to license FX-322 outside the US, although Frequency Therapeutics will receive royalties for sales outside the US.

Institutional ownership amounts to 81% of current shares and big names include [Blackrock, Vanguard, Federated Hermes and others](https://fintel.io/so/us/freq#:~:text=Lucchino%20David%20L.&text=Ownership%20and%20Shareholders-,Frequency%20Therapeutics%2C%20Inc.,a%20total%20of%2027%2C594%2C671%20shares).

In short, the company is well placed financially to get FX-322 to market, assuming the product lives up to expectations.

Recent appointments this year, including [Kevin Franck,](https://www.frequencytx.com/people/kevin-franck-phd/) who is responsible for strategic marketing and planning, and [Quentin McCubbin](https://investors.frequencytx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/frequency-therapeutics-appoints-quentin-mccubbin-phd-chief), are also positive signs that the Phase 2 data Frequency are sitting on is positive.

The last question from an investment point of view then becomes one of how big the market for this drug is.

Here’s just a few numbers for you. The global hearing aids market was recently measured at $8.9 billion and is projected to increase to over [$13 billion by 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/05/2153196/0/en/Global-Hearing-Aids-Market-worth-USD-13-38-Billion-at-8-2-CAGR-GN-Hearing-Launches-Revolutionary-New-Hearing-Aid-Named-ReSound-ONE.html). The cochlea implant market is valued currently just under [$1.7 billion](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cochlear-implants-industry) and is projected to increase by approximately 10% every year until 2027. This would give an expected market cap for cochlea implants of over $3 billion and a combined hearing aid and cochlea implant market of over $16 billion by 2027. Frequency’s market cap is currently just under $1.4 billion. If you may recall, neither hearing aids or cochlea implants are ideal solutions. They only amplify the signal that’s left, they do not restore the signal that is lost - not to mention that aesthetically they are awful. The demand for a natural, regenerative treatment is high and the cost of hearing loss to the world economy is estimated to be approximately [$750 billion annually.](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254659/9789241512046-eng.pdf;jsessionid=FA333887A741DE3503CF3A7F70231FF1?sequence=1)

Approximately 466 million people have hearing loss and the number is increasing exponentially due to the excessively noisy world we live in and increased use of portable sound devices.

Moreover, there is also the global tinnitus market. Some 32% of the US population has tinnitus - approx 100 million people. There is no cure for tinnitus currently and the size of this market as far as a treatment is concerned is pure speculation. For what it’s worth, current tinnitus treatment (such as TRT or CBT) currently costs the UK economy £750 million a year – approximately $1 billion a year. Given the UK has a population of 66 million, I can only imagine how big of a market there is for tinnitus worldwide. I should make it clear, however, that although the primary cause of tinnitus is hair cell death (resulting in misfiring neurons, producing a phantom signal), it is still speculation as to whether FX-322 will cure or treat the condition in these cases. The only evidence we have are the anecdotal cases from Phase 1, as well as the general anecdotal cases of patients with hearing aids and cochlea implants who see their tinnitus improve, suggesting then that the underlying cause is a loss of input.

Frequency Therapeutics also have another drug in their pipeline aimed at treating MS. Their aim is to regenerate the myelin sheath using the same small molecule approach. They are expected to announce this drug candidate for clinical trials later this year. The current MS market is valued at $25 billion and is expected to reach $40 billion by 2027.

Finally, Frequency Therapeutics, in their investor statement, have stated that their small molecule approach may have applications for many other diseases and conditions throughout the body.

**Conclusion**

I believe Frequency Therapeutics are at the pinnacle of a major medical breakthrough and I believe we may be seeing the leader of regenerative medicine in its infancy. I know I am personally and emotionally invested in this company, but I believe I have researched this company enough to know what I’m investing in. I urge others to do their own due diligence as well.

Phase 2 results will be announced end of Q1 2021, and with a [hearing conference taking place this Wednesday](https://www.tinnitustalk.com/attachments/event-schedule_fhhconference-pdf.43840/), which Frequency are sponsoring and presenting at, I believe those results could well be announced as soon as today or tomorrow.

03/16/2021,stocks,Going to buy some Oct LEAPS and sell CC's on this one...
03/16/2021,stocks,"I will say this: From my very limited experience in the market, $40 is quite a bit on the high side for pharmaceutical and biotech companies... At least in terms of companies I know about, like VBIV, Pfizer, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Vistagen, Leap Therapeutics and others I follow. That being said, glad that you are getting help with this, I know of one famous band (well, to me anyway) that saw their longtime lead singer unable to perform live with the band anymore due to his extreme and advanced form of Tinnitus... (It's Algy Ward from the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal band Tank, if anyone cares).   


It's amazing to me, and one of the reasons I love following the stock market, is the incredible and amazing technological innovations that mankind is making on a daily... People ask me why I watch financial reports and financial news channels, and I say it's because the financial sector is filled with more ""good news"" reports than TEN combined news channels and newspapers. Yes, there are some bad financial reports too, but unless it's for stock research, I always seek out the companies doing amazing and great things..."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Not sure you can paint biotech companies with the same broad brush as far as stock price is concerned. Like any company that will depend on the individual circumstances of the company. For example, you mentioned Pfizer, but they have over 5,000 million shares outstanding, hence their huge market cap (almost 200billion). Compare this to frequency, which has 33 million shares outstanding. The supply is far less and this is for a company that stands to treat an unmet need. I was reluctant to put a figure on it but I don’t think a $500 share price is out of reach 5 years from now."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I agree, and as I said my knowledge of biotech and pharma stocks is very limited at best... I probably don't have nearly the amount of knowledge into this sector as others do and readily admit that..."

I also saw you mentioned VBIV. They're another company I have my eye on right now and although I have yet to finish my due diligence, initial indications would suggest that they too could be flying under the radar right now with a price hike any day now."
2021-03-15 22:39:10,stocks,"What to do on green days? So I started investing right at the beginning of February due to a certain meme stonk that shall go unnamed. I understood the risk, lost some money, and started to seriously get into investing. 

I feel as if I have learned a lot, and am actually positive in my investments now. I invested in ATHs in almost all companies that I have in my portfolios but averaged down throughout February and March and caught the bottom on a few of my favorite companies. This allowed me to mitigate losses and actually come out ahead as of today. 

Now my main problem, I dont know what to do on green days like we have been having recently. All I see is a company that was worth x amount last week now being worth far more today and I'm tempted to wait to see if the price drops to buy more. Is this a good strategy? Would love to hear what everyone else does on green heavy days and weeks. It just feels weird that I seem to be paralyzed into inaction on positive days. 

Also, bonus question. I have a couple companies that I believe will only go up long term and have recently started to look at call options. It seems like an almost too good to be true scenario that long term calls at affordable prices where you can leverage 100 shares for a significant price reduction on the shares. Would it be intelligent to buy calls 1 to 2 years out if you believe the company will go up? Or should I just stick to buying the stocks themselves?"

Everyone has an opinion, but you have your strategies, plans, and time window for your plans/goals that those opinions cannot afford to change or accurately benefit you. Always set yourself a goal and exit strategy so that you can be resilient to the bombardment of objectionable opinions and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). You can only trust yourself when it comes to the market. 

This is what I have applied for myself when it comes to the market, especially these days when it takes more discipline for most to prevent impulsive decisions. Hope that helps."

I’ve read on here a few times that it may be smart to be riskier while I’m young, but I was wondering how true this is?


As of right now about half my portfolio is stocks like AAPL, DIS, JNJ and a few others. The other half is ETFs like VOO, BND, and VTI

03/16/2021,stocks,"the usual guideline is to keep single stocks to about 10-15% of the overall portfolio. single stocks are simply much more volatile than funds or ETFs. 

VOO covers about 80% of VTI, so there's significant overlap here. I'd dump VOO and go only VTI for US stocks. or dump VTI and add a mid/small fund ETF to VOO. might want to add an international ETF as well. historically US and international stocks tend to move in cycles, one outperforming the other and then switching. US stocks have outperformed for a decade, so we're due for a rotation. and these international outperformance periods roughly line up with when value stocks outperform in the US ... and we're in the middle of a rotation to value stocks. VOOV has outperformed VOOG over the last few months."

| -- |  -- | -- | -- |
| Tesla | [665 B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics?p=TSLA) | [509,737](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/business/tesla-2020-deliveries.html) | 1304594 |

In recent years, Tesla did not have any competition in the electric vehicle sector.
This will soon change as several competitors are entering the market.

**GM** will sell several EVs (electric vehicles) [this summer](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33352012/gm-electric-cars-cadillac-chevy-buick-hummer-specs/):
* Chevy Bolt 
* Cadillac Lyriq
* Hummer EV SUT 
* [Chevrolet Bolt](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a27542133/chevrolet-bolt-euv-2021-crossover-spied/)

**Toyota** will release two [EVs this year](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131246_toyota-confirms-us-arrival-for-two-electric-vehicle-models-in-2021).

There will also be [numerous other cars coming this summer](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-ford-hummer-new-electric-vehicles-2021) like **Ford** Mustang Mach-E, **Mercedes** EQA, **Nissan** Ariya, **VW** ID.4, **Volvo** XC40 and **BMW** iX.

## Self-driving cars are coming
Elon has promised [for a long time](https://old.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/73eh4m/tracking_elon_musks_visions_promises_and/), that Tesla Vehicles will drive themselves.
But Tesla's auto pilot is singled out as the most dangerous driver-assistance system [by the National Transportation Safety Bord](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/federal-investigators-blast-tesla-call-for-stricter-safety-standads/).

Self driving cars are already here, last year [Waymo started a service of driverless robo taxis in Phoenix](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-waymo-autonomous-phoenix-idUSKBN26T2Y3).
This year it is expanding to [San Francisco and beyond](https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/17/waymo-begins-robo-taxi-tests-in-san-francisco/).

Teslas high valued days are numberd, which is why [Kimbal Musk is selling shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/kimbal-musk-sells-25-million-worth-of-tesla-shares.html)

I am shorting Tesla."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I believe Tesla is still overvalued by a factor of about 2 or maybe 3, but I'm not shorting it. 

shorting a stock is like betting on the exact moment the Titanic goes underwater. Everyone knew it was in trouble after the iceberg, but that doesn't imply we can predict the precise second it goes under."
03/16/2021,stocks,I'd buy their Model Y if I could spare the change for it. It's very popular in NYC. I am seeing more and more Teslas everyday. I see a Model Y every 20 cars. A model 3 every like 10. Sometimes I'll see a model X.
03/16/2021,stocks,"The way to make big money with Tesla is to get a list of individual stock holders then sell it to ponzi schemes, conmen, and cults.  That list would be gold."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Great. Buy a Ford. I'll be sure to wave when I pass you broke down on the side of the road. Ford mass produces...and then no one buys them. 

[Here's an article about how Ford and GM mass produce a lot of cars that don't sell](https://www.motorbiscuit.com/ford-and-gm-waste-a-lot-of-money-on-vehicles-that-arent-trucks-and-suvs/)

Ford and GM make a bad product. They don't last, their parts wear out, and the overall UX is inferior to plenty of other brands. Ability to mass produce means nothing. It's the ability to make a great product and ability to sell. GM has been on the verge of phasing out sedans all together because no one wants theirs. Changing the fuel type won't change everything else that's been wrong with their cars for decades now. 

Also, JD Power is a scam. Their entire business model is based on pay-for-play. If you're a car company, you don't win a JD Power award, you buy it. 

Nevermind that you just repeated the argument that I'm pushing back on: just because GM or Ford is going to make an EV doesn't mean it's going to be good. They're getting beat up in the standard vehicle market, so don't think that just because they're diving into EV means they'll be good at it or magically cure the business woes that have been hurting them for years. Tesla hasn't needed to be bailed out to prevent them from going under. Can't say the same for GM or Ford. So again. Tesla is more than an electric car. The entire user experience is game-changing. It's not just about an electric car, its about the battery, self-driving tech, target recognition, 360 degree camera utilization, driving it from an app, summoning the car from a parking spot to the exit you just walked out of. There's ALOT more they need to catch up on than just an electric motor (and guess who holds a lot of the patents). Ford is struggling to keep up in a realm they've been in for over a century. Don't expect them to suddenly be able to keep up in the electric space. At the very least, realize that it's not Ford and GM who are threatening Tesla's business. It's the other way around. 

>Can Tesla learn how to make a non-shitty product in the next 5 years?

I mean, they make a non-shitty product currently. Can't say the same about Ford or GM. Their products are crap and year over year they keep losing ground to other manufacturers. Believe me, I've tried to find the flaws. Tried to think Tesla is the next Saturn or Geo. It isn't. They're great cars. If they weren't, they wouldn't be seeing the success they are. 

But again...go test drive a Tesla. You'll see. I won't even gloat or say I told ya so. I had to be convinced too."

It would be confusing if you saw Tesla at $2000 one day and then $500 the next because it split 4 from 1. 

So the graph would divide all previous values by 4 to make the graph look right. And then multiply by 4 if the split was 1 from 4.

Sorry if this sounds dumb. I know Im wording it weird 😂"
03/16/2021,stocks,The graph should just display the share price as if the number of shares outstanding never changed from its present value. There are still millions of shares outstanding for that stock. The fact that it says the stock was worth millions per share in 2005 seems unacceptable to me.

I guess you better start contacting all major financial institutions for reporting the numbers this way 😂

This method actually does assume that the outstanding shares never changed by adjusting the historical price to reflect the current float. Reverse splits make the float smaller so historical prices look higher.

hello group, im here asking you guys a few questions about FUBO as this company interests me alot.

ive tried googling from the u.k but cant find much info and wasnt sure if any americans can get more info.

Im from the u.k where gambling has been legal for many years and as far as i know the u.s is now making sports betting legal in some states and FUBO is going to add a sportsbook to their streaming site.

being from the u.k i can see massive potential here for a big company but that depends on their sportsbook.

does anyone know what sportsbook they are going to use?

is it a popular american sportsbook or will it be their own?

does anyone have a confirmed date of this sportsbook?

could anyone here message me when the sportsbook goes live or publicly let us know what it is like.

If the sportsbook is competitive with their odds compared to other bookmakers in the u.s then there would be no need for gamblers to go elsewhere and coming from the u.k gambling addicts will be made from this streaming service and their revenue could go through the roof in a few months of being released.

im very interested in call options on FUBO with a long expiry but wasnt sure if i should wait until we see how competitive they are with this.

good luck to all"

2021-03-15 21:16:10,stocks,"Question: what happens if everyone stopped buying/selling a stock (TSLA for example) I'm still relatively new to stocks, and I'm still trying to understand this and I'm not finding clear answers as what directly (not indirectly) influences the price of a stock.  I mean, on many sites we can find out it's technicals, fundamentals, sentiment etc that affects whether people/organizations buy or sell stock, but that affects the buyers and sellers, not the actual stock price.

So, I'll use TSLA as an example.  Let's remove the buyers and sellers from the problem.  Let's also assume there are no shorts,calls or puts for simplicity.  What would happen if everyone held TSLA right now for months, no one buys more (they hold), no one sells?  Would the price hold over a few days, weeks or months?  Would it decay?  If the market had a correction, would the price of TSLA fall?

\[EDIT\] Thanks for taking the time to reply.  I wondered if there was any ties to financials, but from what I'm reading, no there isn't any direct tie between price and financials.  So stocks are basically a value indicator and financials could be potentially completely ignored if someone simply likes a certain stock.  "

The demand for EV may be slightly further around the corner than investors hoped but it is still around the corner.

2021-03-15 20:34:43,stocks,"Exxon vs Chevron I've owned exxon for a few months now, mostly shares and played some options throughout the time frame. I really like the dividend and the position that they are in today, but moving forward I have been debating on selling or trimming my position and putting some profits into Chevron. 

I really think that exxon gets too much heat for it's environmental impact but I think that's priced in on its upside already, so it's a non-issue at this time. My big worry is they are working on carbon capture instead of truly trying to become a greener company. I'm not exactly sure what carbon capture completely entails, but from what I have been reading, it's really not environmentally friendly since they use that carbon to basically pump more oil. (Very paraphrased, and regurgitated, I'm not 100% how this works.) 

I have always watched Chevron because it's obviously exxon's peer and I've noticed they are taking more steps to becoming a greener company while exxon seems to be in a laggard position and sticking to older ways. I understand that the oil and gas industry isn't going anywhere because of the utilities even besides fuel, but I feel like exxon isn't doing enough during this crucial period, especially with Biden in office. 

Chevron is also in a slightly better cash and debt position, I also view this as almost a non issue because of oil prices right now. But Chevron's breakeven on oil is slightly below $50 a barrel, while exxon's is about $55 overall I believe to maintain their dividend from free cash flow. While oil prices right now are doing great for those numbers, the overall margin of safety with Chevron seems better. 

I was debating owning both but I am starting to see more downside with exxon in the long term than I am with Chevron and am thinking of cutting the whole position and just taking short term gains as opposed to the long. Chevron seems to be in safer, more sustainable position when it comes to share price, albeit a smaller dividend payout. 

Any input on any of these subjects would be appreciated. I truly like the energy industry right now and my best performers have been Devon energy, Suncor, and Canadian natural resources, although I cut CNQ completely and took profits recently.  

I think the american oil industry has been suppressed a bit but I believe it may be justified because of the lack of initiative to change from an environmental standpoint.

I have not sold my exxon shares but have cashed out of all options."

We're not running out of oil, we're running out of inexpensive oil that doesn't take a lot of energy to extract.

If you look at the marginal barrel 50 years ago, it was cheap oil spurting out of the ground Beverly hillbillies style. Now it's either mined with heavy machinery or coaxed out with horizontal drilling and massive diesel engines (frac spreads).

Both these methods take a lot of diesel ... but do return a lot more oil than they use to extract.

Watch this video and see if you can poke holes in it:

Also my company uses Cylance in which BB bought. So the product is near as good as any in the newer EDR world.

The proof will be in the execution going forward, and the sales that come along with that (or don't) over the 2022/23 timeline, but one things seems certain, Blackberry is stronger and better positioned for serious long-term growth than it's been in well over a decade. 3-5 years out (assuming they can execute, which is not a given) no reason this isn't $40+ /share."
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeah I sold mine at 7 dollars after holding for a year
03/16/2021,stocks,"Blackberry is a Software Company nowadays, also Nokia doesn’t have anything to do with mobile phones.

Black Berry is still the only reliable Company to secure a mobile network 100%, this Technology will be more important when new networking Technology will be used."
03/16/2021,stocks,"From my understanding Facebook owes them a few fleets of trucks full of money for patent infringement, case has been won but $$ has not been finalized. Stock will explode from that point in my opinion.

I do not hold bb"
03/16/2021,stocks,">Today they announced

Ah, that's why it was down today."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm a little biased (20 LEAP calls at 10$) but I think BB is working very hard to be in everything as far as the future goes. It does sting to constantly see them denigrated as ""an old failed phone company,"" and it would be great to see price action reflecting their products to a similar multiple as a Crowdstrike, but I think long-term, if you can hold it will be worth it. Between their cyber security solutions and their automotive platform being in literally everything."
03/16/2021,stocks,Do you think BlackBerry should rebrand? Obviously people are going to think of BlackBerry as the phone company that go squashed. So if they went by a different name it may benefit them more than do harm.
03/16/2021,stocks,Buy options contracts for late September to make short term gains then use gains to buy 2022 or 2023 options and hold. The company is solid and has restructured well. Think about it in the late 2000's they could have died out when apple and Samsung took over the phone market but they survived that and are still here.  It speaks to the companies resilience and competence. I say buy and hold.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I've been following them for a long time and personally don't have any faith they'll turn around anymore. Maybe stay afloat and years down the line someone buys them out as the best case scenario, which is possible if someone was interested in integrating their software into a larger solution."
03/16/2021,stocks,"[BB](https://imgur.com/a/blUwBot)

In it for the long haul..."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I think BB has a future and will keep sustained growth as a safe investment but it lags behind competitors and has lost a lot of credit after the WSB fiasco. 

Sold because I didn’t feel enough growth potential"
03/16/2021,stocks,A good entry point will be around 6$. ;-)
03/16/2021,stocks,"Nothing screams Boomer like Blackberry being ignored like this. Guys, can we focus please? A lot has happened you were frozen Mr Powers."
03/16/2021,stocks,200@$25...heavy bags
03/16/2021,stocks,Pump and dump
03/16/2021,stocks,With the amount of shilling blackberry gets every single fucking day on this subreddit from bagholders I hope it stays where it is.
03/16/2021,stocks,Nah. I’ll pass
03/16/2021,stocks,Nothing they announce can ever increase the price back to where i bought them at.
03/16/2021,stocks,I don't understand most of their products.
03/16/2021,stocks,Long term bullish. Thinking about buying more while it’s in the cheap (a.k.a. “averaging down” because I’m “retarded”)
03/16/2021,stocks,"Bearish. It's an old company still in the infantile stages of its new business model. I don't dispute that BB may be undervalued at present, but its successes and prospects are all overblown by the cult of Reddit trying to convince themselves and others that BB is one of those moonshot stocks."
03/16/2021,stocks,The price has more than doubled in the last several months...
03/16/2021,stocks,"That's because they never really bleed that hard, despite losing their previous cash cow. The only thing keeping $BB flat is its future potential, still lots of negative thoughts around ""that old cellphone company"". It's a great time to get in but I see them not moving insanely quickly until they get some proper proof of concept for their switch of industries."
03/16/2021,stocks,"do you know how many people thought that on 2007?

lots.

what you should say is, BB at this price has limited downside in terms of dollar value.

we know its floor is between $6-9 so long as it maintains what its doing. If it exceeds it then itll go up."
03/16/2021,stocks,"What’s “a while”? 

They haven’t really had much *tangible* news even since it started being hyped, mostly just new projects, but nothing actually significant or producing any serious revenue."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Some counter points,

The FB settlement and 90 patents sold to Huawei was very recent so they are not being propped up by that. Unless you can show me some articles on that.

QNX had consistent growth but got stunted by the Corona virus which affected the auto industry as a whole (mentioned by them). They also did mention they were able to increase sales with athoc/spark resulting in a bigger year for 2020 than in 2019 actually."
03/16/2021,stocks,CRWD is very overpriced then
03/16/2021,stocks,"I agree. I think in order for their turnaround story from a phone company to a software company won’t be complete until they start making profit. 

That being said, I think it’s very possible within the next few years."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I get your argument, but QNX barely has any competition at the moment. It is by far the dominant market leader and if it remains so in the years to come I do not see why any car manufacturer will use something different than QNX + QNX Hypervisor + infotainment system (in-house or probably Android auto). 
As for IVY, it can piggy-back on AWS's success in the automotive industry: https://i.imgur.com/WkihIX5.png"
03/16/2021,stocks,every person with the slightest bit of importance in the US government uses a blackberry phone
03/16/2021,stocks,"Bb was a dd before gme, then got caught up in the hype"
03/16/2021,stocks,Or they're just retail bagholders trying to get a momentum pump going.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I know what you mean about the high number of posts. That said BB was one of the BANG stocks at the start of the year, alongside GME, NOK, and AMC, so it's probably just bag holders."
03/16/2021,stocks,you bought it when they were making phones... bruh wtf this was the dumbest comment ive ever read
03/16/2021,stocks,Please god tell me you’re selling covered calls
03/16/2021,stocks,amazon AWS IVY deal...
03/16/2021,stocks,"Agreed, whether they can translate all these partnerships and design wins into sales and real growth over the coming 2-3 years remains to be seen.  Hopefully the coming ER gives us some indication whether things are trending in the right direction."
03/16/2021,stocks,i think they want to retain the name for the IT security that its phones were known for.
03/16/2021,stocks,"BB will have an EV monopoly, subscription based revenue on every car QNX or IVY is in."
03/16/2021,stocks,"If amazon won't cut it, what about having deals with governments, half of the world car makers, deal with the Chinese market. Will that be sufficient? :)"
03/16/2021,stocks,PLTR is not an 8x play in the next 5 years
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m assuming you picked $100 because it’s a nice and round number, not from any comps or intrinsic valuation methods.

They are not a growing company and they have negative EBIT."

Here you go."
03/16/2021,stocks,"They have not really being doing all that much business wise over the last several years.  That has changed a lot in the past year.  They are getting more business deals and finally making real use of their assets.  

The blackberry of today shares little resemblance to the blackberry of old."
03/16/2021,stocks,"The chart tells you nothing about the underlying company.

I don’t like Blackberry but that’s not a good argument against it."
03/16/2021,stocks,"🤣🤣🤣 of course it sounds overrated if you gloss over literally all of the information that builds reason for its value. 

""Honeslty I dont see the appeal in The Beatles. They weren't even famous before people started mentioning something-something rock-and-roll"""
03/16/2021,stocks,why you even commented is beyond me
03/16/2021,stocks,"Opportunity cost, I get rid of my losers if I don’t believe in them anymore. You win some you lose some. Again though that’s if you don’t believe in them, I have some stocks that are quiet right now but I believe will be up soon."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’m not just talking about those two. While those were their most recent/high profile the lions share of BlackBerrys revenue for years has come from licensing and selling their patents. For instance they sold their smartphone business and licence out the Blackberry brand name to TCL, a Chinese telecoms manufacturer.

You can look up BlackBerrys 10K annual filing yourself and read through it if you’re interested in learning more. I’ll give you a couple of the highlights:

31.5% of all 2020 revenue came from patent licensing. 14.5% came from Cylance, a security company they purchased last year. 51.9% of their revenue came from IoT (the category which they place QNX along with 5 other sub companies ) QNX makes up about 1/2 of their revenues from IoT category, which means about 25/26% of revenues come from QNX.

In other words, they make more money from licensing than any of their individual sub companies, most of which have been bought in the past few years.

BlackBerrys only significant growth has from from acquiring existing companies with existing revenues and customer bases.

Here’s another nice little tidbit. Their interest and debt payments for 2020 were $621 million, while R&D expenditure was only $259 million. That is insane for a tech company to have debt repayment almost 2.5 x R&D costs. They won’t be able to keep up. 

Verdict: Zombie company."
03/16/2021,stocks,Agreed. This is a stock you buy and check in every few months. At least for now and in the near future.
03/16/2021,stocks,"That sounds like the sign of a cutting edge growth company in the smart phone space (/s). 

If you actually think extraneous security encryption advantages for the small slice of the population that needs them is good for the long term prospects of the stock, well then good luck. 

If anything there secure cloud based applications on iPhones are a more useful growth prospect moving forward. But even that is replicable and will having intense pricing pressures moving forward."
03/16/2021,stocks,Literally lol why is it so hard for people to understand..
03/16/2021,stocks,Yeahhhhhhhhhhh Shoulda just held on to it
03/16/2021,stocks,pretty sure this dude is just a bag holder at the top. if he wishes he should've bought more the price was $9 a few days ago he could've easily got more at a low cost. typical bb pump from the bagholders
03/16/2021,stocks,"Not really.

It’ll keep the company afloat, but they’re not growing or innovating anymore. If they haven’t switched to paying dividends, you might as well wipe your ass with those stocks.

Blackberry is bot a worthy investment."
03/16/2021,stocks,It's funny how they can spill words like facts when they did not do a basic google search
03/16/2021,stocks,"Anyone can buy an I PHONE . Most people get the phone ""free"" with a 2 year contract"
03/16/2021,stocks,"My point is a well developed phone that has a good PR strategy would be a great catalyst for this otherwise undervalued stock.

And if TESLA came out with a phone, they would take a big share of the market. Apple is not going to be #1 forever as all that goes up must come down."
03/16/2021,stocks,I just have 1 @ $13.36.
03/16/2021,stocks,105 @ 16.84
03/16/2021,stocks,Until it is reflected in their earning report or at least some sort of guidance none of it matters. BB made no mention of how any of these good news translate to sales or even just some sort of growth metric.
03/16/2021,stocks,"absolutely wrong.

it tells you what the market thinks of the company's underlying business."
03/16/2021,stocks,His DD is just looking at the 5y robinhood chart.
03/16/2021,stocks,Ik rite bruhh pltr bb gang apes strong together diamond hands bag holders 4life bruhhh
03/16/2021,stocks,"I see, thanks for the insight."
03/16/2021,stocks,"they arent a phone company anymore, the us government using their phones bc of BB’s known top of the line security is why BB is a good play alone... going by ur logic government contracts arent good because they are for a small part of the population... not including monthly subscription based revenue from every car that will have IVY or QNX in it.

You asked when the last time you saw someone using a blackberry phone, government officials use it, that tells you BB has security locked down... they havnt been making phones for 6+ years idk why ur even talking ab that, again, government officials using BB phones only tells you how good their security is,bb is a top of the line end point security company that will also have a monopoly on EV cars, yes the most important and powerful people in america using BB phones is good.. they are a security company... this is like saying PLTR’s government contracts are bad bc they are for a small population"
03/16/2021,stocks,Pen
03/16/2021,stocks,"There was a ton of selling below $5/share before the rally. The CEO sold 558K shares at 4.67 a few months ago. If you think your company is a sleeping giant, you don't offload a half million shares near the lowest price in 20 years. And surely he owns stock in other companies that he could have sold instead, if he really needed the cash."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You would have to define ""growing"", their ability to scale with their product is great, tapping into the Chinese market is enormous. Many company sold their soul just to get into the Chinese market, specimen A - Blizzard activision. Their software product is not innovation? How do you define that as well, their software is top in class. Recently fedRamp authorized them and that is huge if you understand the implications behind it. It looks to me you understand nothing about BB. Here I thought you had a legit bear case about it"
03/16/2021,stocks,"You’re in a bubble, and you don’t even know how things work there."
03/16/2021,stocks,52 @20.00... I'm in for the long haul now.

03/16/2021,stocks,Average down!  Should be able to bring your cost basis substantially with an additional 10-50 shares.
03/16/2021,stocks,Current Position: 4700 shares at an average of 14.21.  Could not be happier.  Excited to see what happens once they release exactly how much money they receive from Facebook after the lawsuit.  The fact that BB took on one of the biggest tech giants in court and won gives me some great confidence.
03/16/2021,stocks,big man in the thread. Im 200 @ 12.45. Glad to see some real money  at these levels.
03/16/2021,stocks,We are twins!
03/16/2021,stocks,"BB will have a monopoly on EV cars, subscriptiom based revenue... for every car using ivy or qnx... deals with multiple trillion$ companies as a 5 bil market cap stock isnt convincing enough for you? saying bb isnt a good play bevause it hasnt done anything in the past 8 years is dumb as fukc,, they arent selling phones anymore, “ev something somsething security... doesnt make sense” i thought the people in r/stocks do actual DD on companies? I bet you think GME was overvalued at 40$ too."
03/16/2021,stocks,22 here :)
03/16/2021,stocks,"I can see your perspective, but just to be sure, options aren't priced according to your cost basis. They're priced according to the current price of the stock. So even if you bought in at $25, that doesn't disallow you from making strike calls at $12 when the stock's at $10. If you get assigned, you can roll, or you can buy back the stock, and it'd be the same as if you ""averaged down"" to $10 and then made the $12 calls. 

Whether to buy at $8 is, in fact, independent of whether you already own the stock or not. The question is how under valued you feel the stock is. But people have created this ""average down"" idea that creates the false impression that if you buy enough shares, you'll limit your down side. No, that just exposes you to *more* potential down side. The maximum loss of 100 shares at $25 is $2500 if the stock went to 0. The maximum loss of 200 shares at an average of $16.5 is $3600 if the stock went to 0. This is not to say ""go sell your losing positions"" but rather to say - if you made a mistake over valuing a stock, don't double down."
03/16/2021,stocks,There is so much illogical stuff in here I’m just going to wish you the best of luck on your investment.
03/16/2021,stocks,"> CEO sold 558K

I see he still has a million shares in blackberry, and 60,000 in walt disney and 39,000 in Wells Fargo."
03/16/2021,stocks,"> Their software product is not innovation?

It was when it first came out. You’re probably too young to remember, but that was the key selling point of Blackberry smartphones, and there were rare blackouts that caused panic across the corporate world.

Where has Blackberry gone since then? They lost the most lucrative markets, bungled multiple attempts to make a comeback, and finally settled on building some security tools. Good on them for surviving, I guess.

It’s kind of like how Nokia was reduced to map services for a few years after Microsoft slurped out their insides like a Brain Bug. Sure, it’s a solid product and it makes money, but the market’s already saturated and there are other companies earning more.

I don’t anticipate Blackberry will dip either, for what it’s worth. I just see it as stagnant."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Alright let me hit you with some knowledge I would have been happy to have years ago.
1. Only invest in what you truly believe in. DO NOT jump into a stock cuz you seen it on Reddit.
2. Wait for a dip might take days or weeks but timing is everything 
3. Macd apple stock look it up and learn to read it. Learn what stock price is suggested to be at look at spikes and current news of stock / similar stocks

4. Don’t be greedy and if you are gonna be greedy do 1 big play with 80% max always keep 20% just in case you have to earn it al back.

5. Feel free to send me a tip when you see gains. 

Bonus 
If blue and red start split and blue is on top and current price is less than average estimated price then stock price likely to go up. 
When red and blue are far apart price tends to fall.
Again important to keep up with news"

03/16/2021,stocks,"This. I would also add to beware of goalpost moving. 6 months ago my plan was to invest 20K @ an avg. cost of $45 in Nio and come back and in 2 years when it hits $100, or 50K. This was gonna ne enough to pay off my solar panels, refinance my house and also pay off my new HVAC system while also doubling my emergency fund.

Long story short I ended up using margin and ended up at a high of 58K at one point. But I didn't sell. I started thinking ""Well, now on top of initial goals I can also have X amount in retirement by 30, get my mom a decent used car"" and etc. Then the correction happened and I'm barely above 25K now. (Though I'm definitely better off than a year ago because I least paid off my car three years early).

So yeah, have a set price in mind and STICK TO IT"

03/16/2021,stocks,"This sounds like...a very weak thesis? Overseas manufacturers aren't going to win government contracts for big infrastructure spending, and that's what's driving green energy stocks at the moment. Winning government contracts is going to make or break a lot of these companies. It seems kind of tautological that the companies best-poised to get said contracts (US companies/manufacturing) would have the most frothy valuations.

Unfortunately I (like many others) have no real information to pick the winners. So...if I want green energy exposure, I'm going to get it by trusting the Biden-connected Blackrock people. 

Whether or not green energy is worth investing in at these valuations is a separate question, but picking the winners and losers seems like a fool's errand unless you're very well connected or are going to spend countless hours figuring out which companies are connected to which Congresspeople/administration officials. 

I'd be pretty skeptical of anyone picking apart Blackrock's ICLN portfolio currently without offering an alternative that's got a reasonable shot of exposure to infrastructure spending unless they're digging in and defending that an infrastructure bill either won't happen or won't matter. And that's not a thesis I'd be too receptive to.

My theory is that when it comes to industries that largely depend on government contracts, trust that corruption is real and embrace it. ""Oh, a Raytheon and Nucor board member is now Secretary of Defense? Sign me up!""

Just my two cents/not financial advice/etc."

03/16/2021,stocks,There were two budget reconciliations for this year so they should be able to get it through.

03/16/2021,stocks,What happens if we buy APHA calls when they merge? Does a $20 APHA call turn into a $20 TLRY call?
03/16/2021,stocks,"No, it’s adjusted down as well"
03/16/2021,stocks,I read that the call will still be a 20$ call but on 83 shares instead of 100.  really just posting this so someone corrects me.
03/16/2021,stocks,If we know about it than its already been calculated into the price
03/16/2021,stocks,42 day old account calling someone a shill...
03/16/2021,stocks,When your asking what happens during a merger that’s very public and if you are here as an “investor” it’s a stupid question because it means you came straight here and did ZERO research.  Excuse me? What do days on an account have to do with logic and common sense?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Imo, it's going to be a bit of both, with TLRY moving down a bit and APHA moving up a bit to cover the current difference (short term). However, the merger is considered great news so expect both to move up, maybe TLRY goes up a decent chunk and APHA moves up tremendously (in 1month when they merge on 4/20 blaze it)."
03/16/2021,stocks,Not the advice they want but the advice they need
03/16/2021,stocks,"Who cares. We come here to learn. You are obviously new here, stop gatekeeping"
03/16/2021,stocks,"They’ve already moved up tremendously on this news, IMO it’s all priced in and only bad news can move the stock out of stagnation now, it priced in a perfect future already"
03/16/2021,stocks,You're welcome! I haven't dabbled in fractional shares so unfortunately I'm not sure.
03/16/2021,stocks,I recall reading it converts at a ratio of 0.8381:1 and it always rounds down. Something like 100 shares would be terrible as you would get rounded down from 83.81 shares to 83 and lose .81 of a share.
03/16/2021,stocks,I appreciate you
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don’t think that word means what you think it means. Obviously everyone is here to learn, but coming here and expecting everyone else to build you a grand portfolio is, well wrong. This isint a place for financial advise or understanding the absolute basics. Look in the rules. There’s other sites for this type of question."
03/16/2021,stocks,You are new here. You don’t make the rules.
03/16/2021,stocks,Gotcha. So you’re buying the options rather than the stock to reduce the cost/risk?
03/16/2021,stocks,I would love to post the screenshot of my store storefront on instacart because it's much more then groceries and a much better service then some of the nay sayers here but idk how best to do that. But I have 48 stores I can order from and have anything in the store delivered to the front door of my 4th floor apartment building in under an hour. Thats pretty sweet.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Meh. I'd use the same logic as Doordash. It just doesn't seem like a highly lucrative business model.

Now, Instacart does have deals with retailers, whereas Doordash is focused on food delivery. But it just doesn't jump out at me as a great play.

Also consider that the pandemic is (fingers crossed) looking to be in its later stages, which means that Instacart likely won't be having a drastic increase in business.

My two cents."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I mean they do bring it up to my 4th floor apartment and pre-covid they would bring it into my apartment and place it on my kitchen counter. Idk if they changed but I've tried to do Amazon grocery delivery before and I ended up not even going through with it because as soon as I put idk like olive oil or something liquid and a little heavier that was considered Amazon pantry and they charged like $30 right off the bat for it. I've used pea pod before and it was no better than instacart and it was only for stop and shop. Instacart is pretty good. During the pandemic it was a mess, and you had to get lucky at 4am to actually be able to put through an order for a week in advance, but I'm up at that time anyways and you couldn't get the stuff on Amazon and amazon had jacked up prices, instacart prices were the same and the lines at my local costco and every grocery store were like 4 hours long, and instacart still delivered without me having to go out and deal with that. I tipped more generously then usual. Having the instacart subscription can definitely be worth it, if you order groceries like twice a month you save more then you pay I think. Normally, under ideal circumstances, like not covid lines, instacart gets my groceries to me in like an hour from ordering. Idk if it's a good investment, just saying I personally think it's a pretty good service."
03/16/2021,stocks,Once during the pandemic is not really a good indicator of their performance. Just saying. I passed by a costco once during the pandemic and the line wrapped around the building and the wait to get in to the building was like 4 hours. 1/10 would not shop there lol.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Right, it's not JUST groceries, it's been expanding out to a lot of different retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, grocery stores, and the store selection is getting pretty extensive."
03/16/2021,stocks,It being a good service doesn’t mean it’s a profitable service or has the potential to be one.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Right, and that was my point at the end was to clarify I wasn't making any statement about those things, just wanted to give my input on how it is as a service, where it's useful and works well, and why people would use it."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I would assume the same reason you can't necessarily just copy any other product or business and immediately strike it big. Instacart has the name recognition, people are already using it and it would take incentive for them to switch, and it took instacart a while to work out deals with the stores to work with them, a new company would have to go to target and say ""work with me instead of instacart (or in addition to)"" and be successful at that negotiation, and do that with the 30 stores that instacart has. When instacart first started out they had like 3 store offerings near me, now they do like every major grocery store, drug store, small stores etc...

Sure it could happen, and someone might come up with a way to do it better, but once a business is established in the market it would take something new, or different, or big money like amazon to unseat them."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Agreed. It's a solid service, but I don't necessarily see it as being a promising investment."

They do pull an Apple though and make new accessories not compatible with older models which is scummy IMO"
03/16/2021,stocks,If we do pump to 30-50 you should take major profits.  This thing will pump and dump like Tilray if we get up to those levels.
03/16/2021,stocks,If we gain 12.64 your puts are going to get destroyed.  Just a warning.
03/16/2021,stocks,Depends on the expiration date amigo

03/16/2021,stocks,very true.  I will get puts eventually as well lol especially if we pump.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Retail will always exist because of apparel.

Amazon & e-commerce still sucks for apparel, given the hit-n-miss nature of sizing and textile quality. Think of how many clothes you ordered from e-commerce that didn't fit right. You really need to examine/try clothes before you buy them. 

And this is more important for fine clothes, which companies like Nordstrom's is taking advantage of.

Same can also be said of regular retail products. So much of Amazon is crap, but there's a level of quality you expect from companies like Macy's. These companies are adapting to e-commerce competition by focusing on their strengths against Ecommerce,"

I think the crash wont be actuall crash where everything loses value in short period of time, but rather many and many red days for a longer period of time. 

But longer (higher) the bubble grows, the bigger fall will be."

03/16/2021,stocks,Okay?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Its because Macy's has fashion. You need retail for fashion, especially at the high end. E-commerce still doesn't cut it. 

Also, Amazon still only has the most basic generic brands. They don't have a real high-end fashion marketplace. And many luxury brands like Chanel don't even have ANY e-commerce presence, and strictly forbid it.

Retail will always exist."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I feel the same. I sold all of my XLF when it got close to 32, which was at the top end of my price target. And missed out on the opportunity to sell it for a few dollars more and rotate it to the on sale growth I like. Luckily I was still holding plenty of other ""Value"" stocks to do this with, but it's kind of funny that I got nervous about Financials valuations 10% ago but have had no problem with these expensive high growth companies. It's just hard to own companies that you aren't certain how long they can maintain their position far in to the future."

I'd say you're not crazy at all, it's just nigh impossible to discuss something people are so emotionally invested in. Even those who don't think it will do well are strongly opposed to anyone discussing legitimate reasons why it could take off, all ""but he was into pet supplies"", as if other people didn't try to sell them and fail miserably where Cohen succeeded."

>Ford Motor Credit, of course, finances car purchases. It has roughly $130 billion in auto loan and lease assets and $15 billion in cash. Ford Motor Credit assets, like any other bank, are loans and not plants and inventory like Ford’s (ticker: F) automotive operations. Ford Motor Credit finances those loans using about $140 billion in total debt and $14 billion in equity.  
>  
>The assets—the cash and loans—don’t balance exactly with the liabilities because there are a few other categories of assets and liabilities excluded for simplicity. Total assets at Ford Motor Credit are about $155 billion. That’s large enough to make Ford’s (ticker: F) finance arm a top-20 bank in the U.S.  
>  
> The rest of Ford has about $24 billion in debt. The car company also lists about $29 billion in cash on its books. When the car and finance company are separated, it shows the car company has more cash than debt.

03/16/2021,stocks,"Ford has marketshare and mindshare now which goes a long way, especially since auto consumers have a lot of brand loyalty. However, Ford has the most to lose with newer EV manufacturers. Fleets are only loyal to the bottom line. If electric cars are more cost competitive short and long-term, fleets and government vehicles will quickly go electric which Ford drastically lags behind. Their partnership with Rivian is critical but might be too little too late. I foresee the rental industry, gov, police going majority electric in 5-10 years. Once that happens, Ford wont be able to meet that demand IMO and it will lose significant market share"
03/16/2021,stocks,Any analysis to share?
03/16/2021,stocks,"It could be. A lot of things took quite a hit today so I'm not sure if the bond offering had anything to do with it, it could have simply been a pullback from the momentum that F has seen over the last few weeks. 
I can't give you individual advice unfortunately. I would say that theta decay is going to hurt you a lot more on those April calls than the June ones, so you may want to consider them differently."
03/16/2021,stocks,If you're a shareholder you get a discount on new vehicles? How much?
03/16/2021,stocks,"I don’t own Ford, and haven’t run the numbers, but assuming they are similar to GM (which I understand they are) a stock I owned for a few months in 2020, pension obligations are nearly crippling. They are large enough to seriously limit almost any potential upside. When you own a stock you also own it’s debts. Buy a foreign auto without the pension burden. Debts are the reason why F multiples are so low. There is no free lunch, and one of the most iconic American companies certainly isn’t flying under the radar. The street hates the legacy autos because of debt levels and they are right to do so."
03/16/2021,stocks,The exact amount depends on what you are buying. It is roughly [4%](https://s23.q4cdn.com/799033206/files/doc_downloads/Ford-Shareholder-Application-11-5-20.pdf) above the employee price.

ON is $40, but... already really high on P/E at 70 against sector average 35 or so, and worse is even though it is beating earnings, it has a fairly paltry 0.52 EPS against sector average 5. it's EPS growth lags the sector and honestly, other than being an American semiconductor manufacturer, it has no real super exciting news. analyst seem to be fairly bullish on it, but it has so-so fundamentals."

In a bear market, share prices are continuously dropping. This results in a downward trend that investors believe will continue; this belief, in turn, perpetuates the downward spiral.

No, the market WILL either correct or crash. Soon. How soon and by how much? These are things very few people know beforehand and no amount of reasoning the whys and hows are going to lead you to a correct answer. Believe me, I've been here before.

So, will it be in 2021? 2022? 2023? Don't ask me, I don't know. And that's THE POINT. For sure at some point a tumble will get triggered and it's most likely none of us are going to see it coming. Is your portfolio ready for the market to take a tumble? Are you going to go ""Nice! Stocks on the cheap!"" or ""Ouch, margin calls are not fun""? Up to you.

But the money printing will increase inflation, which will increase nominal interest rates and maybe even real rates, making fixed income comparatively more attractive than it will have been for many years, so who knows how much money will flow that way.

For now everything looks completely fine, even through the rona lockdowns and all that. IT MAKES NO SENSE, so please stop trying to make sense of something that is completely illogical in the first place."

You also have to explain why inflation is in the gutter after two prior stimuli and even more QE.  

The reality is that the old line that ""the larger the money supply, the greater the inflation"" has no empirical basis.  

Inflation comes from the supply/demand curve.  If you have more money, you have more demand and *IF* supply cannot meet demand, prices rise to price out the lowest bidders.  This is why having an underutilized labor force is a buffer against inflation and why Keynes and many others pointed out that govt expenditure to raise demand is the correction to a cold economy.  You heat it up until employment is full or nearly full and then you coast.  If you overheat it, you raise taxes and pull money out."

03/16/2021,stocks,"So, you are talking about velocity, right?  If those dollars have a chance to create economic activity (demand), then supplies will be strained and prices will rise. 

I agree with that fully.  However, when you have increased demand, the demand for labor increases to fill that demand.  After all, businesses to not want to leave unfulfilled demand on the table.  So hiring picks up.  Since there is massive untapped labor to be utilized in filling that demand, inflation will be transitory, as Powell and Yellen have both pointed out.  

The thing is that the money supply is only correlated to inflation and where that money is in the economy will have massively different effects.  If most of the new money has no velocity as it has for decades in the US, inflation will be low, again as it has been.  If the money is in the hands of the bottom 4 quintiles, it will have more velocity and thus cause more demand/hiring and drive up wages if it gets high enough. 

The money supply must ALWAYS be increasing.  Running a surplus in federal govt is uniformly a bad idea (barring a case where you are in an overheated economy, and possibly not even then.  Every surplus run by the govt in history has led to a recession or depression).  

Here is what my personal expectation is: these savings, which are substantial will cause demand.  I expect the travel sector to experience a golden age.  The house construction industry will probably also boom.  Cars will do well.  Tech will do well and the market will do well.  

I'm personally not at all concerned about long term inflation and claims by people like Michael Burry that it's going to be the Weimar Republic are ahistorical and ridiculous.  The Weimar Republic borrowed gold to pay its reparations and that is the reason it experienced hyperinflation.  We aren't borrowing resources or other currencies to create this spending.  All of this money is being issued in USD by the fed."

I would say if the government does a good job it can control inflation at 3% for the next 10 years


Pretty much interest rates will keep rising. We won't see inflation until interest rates are capped. Inflation might peak at 3-4% by the time the fed decides to do something else about it

1.  Inflation comes from the supply/demand curve

2.  Inflation is only correlated to the money supply.

The keys to all of it are real resources and labor.  The data empirically support this position.

>Pretty much interest rates will keep rising. We won't see inflation until interest rates are capped. Inflation might peak at 3-4% by the time the fed decides to do something else about it 


But rates aren't rising and Powell, the Chair of the fed said he won't raise rates until employment targets are reached.  The Fed has monopoly control on rates.  When he signals he is considering rates, maybe consider adjusting your positions.  Until then, party on Wayne and Party on Garth.

>If they continue with more stimulus that wouldn't be good

AFAIK, there are no plans to increase or do additional stimulus until the current stimulus has played out.  We can burn that bridge when we come to it, and as of now, I agree with you.

Edit:

>Yes money supply has always increased. Purposely so. 2% inflation targets. It's good for government debt and the tax payer. 

I mean there are more fundamental reasons to need to increase the money supply.

In 1980, the US pop was 224M or so.  Today its more like 330M.  If you wanted everyone in the entire economy to be paid the exact same amount of money with an exactly equal standard of living, the total amount of money in existence would have to increase in order to accommodate that, right? 

If you don't expand the money supply, you have less money per person in a growing economy, to say nothing about money needed for investment, increased standards of living, increased savings, and surely, the ballooning of net worth we have seen in the wealthiest 5%.  In fact this last point can be tied back to the velocity point.  The vast majority of new money for the last 40 years has went to corporations and tax cuts to the wealthy.  These are low velocity places to put money, so the economy languished.  For the last half of the Clinton administration and the GWB administration, growth was fueled almost entirely by an increase in private debt."

I think this is a “buy the rumor, sell the news” situation. There are some really troubled companies that are roaring because of the reopening narrative. AMC, for example, was in trouble before the pandemic. Now they have even more debt and diluted the hell out of their shares but people are buying because there will be a big return to the movies.  They have said themselves that if attendance returns to 90% of pre-covid levels by July then that only means they’ll stay solvent until March. Yikes!  Sea World is another that doesn’t make a damn bit of sense at an ATH. Why would they be better than ever???  Their business has been struggling since Blackfish, and the pandemic hit them hard because they couldn’t just shut down... they still had animals to take care of.

It's not black and white. Literally haven't seen any article that says ""DONT HOLD ANY CASH"", so idk read what they have to say? If you can't acknowledge that there are **some** reasons to hold cash after reading everything I have nothing to add, I guess somehow we just disagree.

Again I don't think you should hold more than 5-10% total cash if you're a normal long-term investor just DCAing in constantly, but idk if you're playing meme stocks aggressively or daytrading maybe you should? If you're 100% convinced that there is gonna be a downturn (like I was in Jan before COVID) I think it's valid to free up cash, not everyone has the same exact long term strategies as you"
03/16/2021,stocks,You should never hold onto depreciating assets in your portfolio. That's literally the opposite of what you should be doing. The only reason to hold onto cash is so that you can buy things when they go on sale. That's literally the only reason to even have money lying around in your account.

Buffet is a great guy of course, and he's playing a whole different game than you or me. He's not trying to grow as much as he's trying to hold wealth. I need to grow because I'm a poor. And cash is a terrible place for growth."
03/16/2021,stocks,"> The only reason to hold onto cash is so that you can buy things when they go on sale

yes that's literally one of the main points in the many articles I sent you, you replied after 1 minute lol, you obv didn't even read them. Almost every article I've found basically talks about liquidity, opportunity, and reduced portfolio volatility. They say to not have more than 5%-10% cash and that most investors shouldn't time the market. What do you disagree with, I don't understand?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"You know what you have a point. I'm definitely not responding peacefully and that's my bad.

As I said originally I got kinda offended, I was just posting some differing viewpoints to `No one in investing ever says, hold cash`, you got me heated when you called all my articles biased/shilly/pointless when their points are valid lol. Also you assumed I disagreed with you & am holding cash, when I agree with you but am just trying to provide viewpoints besides the echo-chamber ""only DCA in, 100% cash, don't time the market"", which I actually mostly follow!

> I'm just making my points.

That's fine, again I just really disagree with `No one in investing ever says, hold cash`. I'm sorry for making it personal, that wasn't the intent and I just was trying to disagree with that initial statement. Cheers man"
03/16/2021,stocks,Because why would you have liquidity sitting in your brokerage account instead of your bank account? Your brokerage account only lets you trade in so many types of assets and you may want to spread your holdings out over several different platforms depending on your trading behavior.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Cheers. I put myself out there bluntly because I want to be challenged. If I'm proven wrong, great. I can correct myself. 

It was bad wording to talk about cash in absolute terms. 

But for me, what you've said reinforces my views on cash in a brokerage account. 

And I wouldn't consider taking cash at the end of the day to put it in the next day as holding cash. 

And those that yolo on meme stocks have issues with basic fundamentals, not the nuanced how much cash should I keep in reserve."

I don't know but why is that relevant? I don't care if it's the brokerage acct or bank acct, it's cash either way. I don't understand what the point is, I can transfer between my brokerage acct and bank account pretty much instantaneously? Hm where is our disconnect, is it the definition of the word liquidity?

> One of the key advantages of holding cash, particularly for aggressive investors, is liquidity allows for opportunistic purchases when company valuations decline to attractive levels.

Obviously this isn't geared towards the DCA/long term only crowd, but how can you disagree with this statement? Cash (in brokerage/bank/savings) is extra liquidity, you don't have to free it up by selling assets. If you **want** to time the market, are 100% convinced that the market is going down, and want to buy cheap do you not see the value of having liquid cash?

I'm not saying timing the market is a good idea, but if you are set on doing it and are in the situation above you should free up cash lol. Every article I posted talks about situations like these, idk what you want lol.

Bro do you not get that I understand the time in the market > timing the market and shit? I 100% understand that you don't want to hold cash esp when there's rising inflation lol, everything you have said I mainly agree with besides how black and white ya'll say ""dont hold any cash ever"""
03/16/2021,stocks,"> Cheers. I put myself out there bluntly because I want to be challenged. If I'm proven wrong, great. I can correct myself.

Yep this is the reason I post on here too, I respect it!

Yep and I would def suggest most people follow your (and my) views, especially if you've come to your own conclusions as you very obviously have. Your reasoning all makes sense so I'm not worried about people like you following advice blindly.

But if you're a new investor/gambler figuring out how to make money, read as much literature as you can. When someone says ""don't hold cash"", google it and figure out the pros and cons of the action. Cheers all, good luck making $$"

03/16/2021,stocks,"Well like any stock it's a gamble for what *you* think will happen in the future. Here's some scenarios:

a) The world goes back to normal, climate change is ignored (as has been largely thus far) and the oil industry prints money. 
b) The world goes back to ""the new normal"". Air travel of which a significant portion of profit is business related stagnates as companies have learnt to deal without the expense (I for one do not see myself ever travelling to the USA twice a year again), higher prices are pushed on to leisure travelers and the airline industry never recovers. Oil companies need to invest in an alternate crude slate / write down assets. 
c) The world goes back to normal but accelerated interest in climate change along with the phase out of ICE vehicles slowly brings about a decline in the oil industry which will never truly go away but may settle at a significantly lower value rather than the king-makers they have historically been known to be. In this scenario some winners may emerge in the industry as well. For better or worse I'm sitting on bp shares which were cheap but they are also probably the most aggressive company currently in terms of adopting an alternate business strategy as an integrated company, so that's my personal long hold play.

You'll find people who support each of the scenarios. But while I think there's long term plays to be had here, I don't foresee any get rich quick schemes. Disclosure: I'm not a filthy rich investor so take my comments with a grain of salt. This game would be easier with a crystal ball :-)"

03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm not so sure about this. Even the Paris Climate Accord accounts for an increase in oil/gas consumption across all participating countries. Especially as they try and reduce reliance on coal energy. 

I'd very much like to see oil consumption go down, but the reality is to combat growing economic tensions between China and the US we need to ramp up southeast Asian manufacturing FAST. That means oil. Plus, that doesn't even begin to discuss African economic boom or the production backlog that are both going to require a lot of oil in the short-term. Lastly, even if we have reached peak oil consumption, RDS and CVX are both prepared to make transitions into natural gas, wind, solar, etc as the OP mentioned."
03/16/2021,stocks,"> Even the Paris Climate Accord accounts for an increase in oil/gas consumption across all participating countries. Especially as they try and reduce reliance on coal energy.

Oil and gas are not the same thing. There's been no increase in oil anywhere attributable to a reduction in coal support. In fact most countries have prioritised the reduction of oil for electricity generation and heating *before* reducing dependency on coal. What has increased dramatically is gas. But not all oil companies are in both industries so you need to be very selective. 

> we need to ramp up southeast Asian manufacturing FAST. That means oil.

That is very much 50s era thinking. What you need is primary energy increase, there's no reason that primary energy consumption needs to be oil. If anything China has already shown that primary energy consumption can largely be decoupled from energy source, though they still are very much linked to oil mainly in their transport sector. 

> Lastly, even if we have reached peak oil consumption, RDS and CVX are both prepared to make transitions into natural gas, wind, solar, etc as the OP mentioned.

The question is how much you trust the investment here, and choosing which company you think will make this transition. I've already said in another post I'm a bp shareholder so take this with whatever bias which may be included, but one company has mad a very stark transition in an extreme way with almost weekly news stories about them giving up on some oil related activity in favour of green energy, and the other has spectacularly done only enough of the bare minimum to stop institutional investors giving up on them. 

Time will tell how well they do. But so far news from Shell's part AGMs has been that shareholders have largely been incredibly disappointed with their green plans to date. Heck they set an investment target in 2019 that shareholders thought was too low and then proceeded to miss that crappy target as well."

tell that to Taiwan and HK. But to your point, what other source can compete with the speed to delivery of fossil fuel? I just don't see any other source being able to meet demand if the bull thesis of post-covid marketplace proves true. 

> But so far news from Shell's part AGMs has been that shareholders have largely been incredibly disappointed with their green plans to date.

Also valid. 

I too am a RDS.B stockholder, also own CVX and CLNE as part of my overall oil/gas play. Your insight has been most helpful and appreciate you taking the time to respond."
03/16/2021,stocks,"> But to your point, what other source can compete with the speed to delivery of fossil fuel?

Demand for what is the key question. What are you trying to deliver. If you're talking purely transport then I fully agree with you. If you're talking primary energy in general then the development curve of Asia by no means needs to follow that of the west as they benefit from modern developments. 

I didn't learn engineering using a sliderule either ;-)

03/16/2021,stocks,Gotcha. I guess I was hoping for general information on ETF rebalancing and the mechanisms behind it rather than info relating to any certain meme stock. Information that is bias free seems to be more helpful.
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm seriously considering XLE, do you think this is a 3-6 month hold, (just the rotation) or longer?"
03/16/2021,stocks,And how does that work out for you?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Don’t think so - especially the proposals on estate taxes.  Under Trump, estate taxes are shielded up to around $11.2 million.  Under Biden, any estate over $1 mil and uncle Joe gets 40% of your inheritance - that’s an enormous difference."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Not sure I’m following. You say for tax purposes you add them together and then you say later you have to break them out. 

Are you saying I will I be paying tax on my sell price - cost basis - fees?"
03/16/2021,stocks,That’s what I’m thinking. At least until the hype around reopening wears off
03/16/2021,stocks,They are doing a full press release this week I believe debunking the whole report. Don’t have the link handy I saw it over the weekend
03/16/2021,stocks,"If they’re actually safe plays, today’s price action means nothing. Get a hobby and check back in five years."
03/16/2021,stocks,That was my guess . Or people taking out to put into meme stocks
03/16/2021,stocks,"
Hmm, very good point. Think you’re right about the Spring melt up. What are you looking at specifically if things drop again? I’m looking at CRM, FB, WMT, AAPL, QCOM. Also, do you have a position in BABA/JD? Interested in dipping my toe in Chinese tech due to the large decreases we’ve seen over the last 2 months."
03/16/2021,stocks,Debating same thing on airlines...approaching pre-Covid levels and I feel like I should take my profits and go elsewhere
03/16/2021,stocks,I’m going to put stop losses on my airlines and keep riding them 😂
03/16/2021,stocks,"Love those payment stocks for the future: SQ, PYPL, MA, and V all in my portfolio."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Hey we've had some ups since then. My point is the concept of true stock value is dead. You should only worry if investor confidence wavers. And generally I don't see that happening anytime soon.

P/E is still useful to see if a stock is getting overhyped, and square is a little hyped, but at least it isn't tesla levels. Besides they just became profitable."
03/16/2021,stocks,Is this a reference to the episode where they sold gas? Or another one I’m forgetting
03/16/2021,stocks,"Fair enough. 
Hopefully someone more knowledgeable than me will see this then"
03/16/2021,stocks,Portfolio currently up 40% this year. 10% if you take out some of the riskier/luckier trades
03/16/2021,stocks,"You know how the knee jerk reaction in IT is, ""did you turn it off and back on""? Well on things like personal finance its, VTI. Or some other variant from vanguard. Primarily because it's a tried and true portfolio. Doing monthly or weekly deposits into it for 30 years will always be a safe and good option. Aside from the capital building on fire it's pretty safe."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Source? Sounds nuts

And when I say nuts I mean like I almost don’t believe you"
03/16/2021,stocks,"You’ll just use your purchase price as a cost basis, but, can deduct your brokerage fee as an expense.  Hope that helps."
03/16/2021,stocks,You were wrong lol
03/16/2021,stocks,Cool.  Think I'll pick up some more shares tomorrow.

03/16/2021,stocks,Are you long term investor?
03/16/2021,stocks,Pretty sure VTI was up that day lol
03/16/2021,stocks,"You have the internet and a wealth of credible news resources at your fingertips.  Look it up!  The coming tax increases are very high, but, are being touted with the usual - ‘tax the rich’, or ‘make them pay their fair share’, the usual line.  Ask your accountant or tax attorney.  Those in the know have been setting up new trusts for their estates to take advantage of existing tax law before the Biden tax increases become law."
03/16/2021,stocks,Gotcha
03/16/2021,stocks,Thank you
03/16/2021,stocks,"If you’ve done your DD and really, really believe in the company, do it. I personally wouldn’t touch it with a 10 foot pole, however."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Currently just swing trading stocks I see as undervalued or primed for a quick burst. Don’t trust the market enough right now to enter any new long term positions.

Edit: also should note that I’ve only been investing for about a year so I’m by no means an expert and could just be getting lucky so far"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Your the one that made the claim if you have over a million in inheritance that Biden wants 40 percent of it lmao. You provide a source before spewing nonsense

Also, the source should say it’s already in affect. Like what you said"
03/16/2021,stocks,How long have you been trading for?
03/16/2021,stocks,"‘Wants’ is future tense - in other words, in the future.  It is what has been floated by the Biden camp.  Again, not nonsense, just fact.  If this has an actual effect upon you, I’m sure that you’d have already performed DD.  If not, it shouldn’t be a concern.

However, upcoming tax increases will effect everyone - be it cost of goods, capital gains on your stock transactions to direct taxes.  The present administration presents it as ‘paying a fair share’, or ‘taxing the rich’, when, it’ll affect many more.

People who are actually ‘rich’ have already move assets elsewhere to a place where Uncle Joe can’t have at it.  Likewise, many companies will move their operations to a more tax-friendly climate."
03/16/2021,stocks,See edit
03/16/2021,stocks,Nice good luck to you
03/16/2021,stocks,Hey everybody sell gme.  When it goes down we can buy it and then make money again.
03/16/2021,stocks,There has been a bunch of talk in WSB about ETF rebalancing being good for GME in the coming week because the ETFs will recall shares. Is there any truth to this? I can't find a source on this. Do all ETFs rebalance on the same day?
03/16/2021,stocks,Is it possible for Gamstop to crash again?
03/16/2021,stocks,Is a share recall actually a thing? Can a company have a meeting and and account for all shorted shares? This gets tossed around but I'm not finding anything at all online. Bullshit? Examples?
03/16/2021,stocks,Welp just got my stimmy today. Gonna be responsible and dump it all on some options 🤡.
03/16/2021,stocks,Anyone can recommend new stocks go buy for tomorrow?
03/16/2021,stocks,"AABB app is out and I see no cliches with it, I’m stoked."
03/16/2021,stocks,Thoughts on RIDE this week??
03/16/2021,stocks,I think GME is only going to go up. There are too many people holding and buying at every dip. Retail has volume !
03/16/2021,stocks,What are people’s thoughts on GME? I’m currently invested and think it has huge potential to moon back to 400+ just want other people’s thoughts
03/16/2021,stocks,Hm
03/16/2021,stocks,Have you guys received your yummy stimmy?
03/16/2021,stocks,I just bailed on GME. My portfolio is now 100% available lol. What should I look at now?
03/16/2021,stocks,Grab some amc to recoup some losses
03/16/2021,stocks,"Tomorrows open is important, entirely possible it could head back to 340 this week especially towards the end of the week when options expire. Or it could plummet. Doubt it would hit 40, looks more like 130 where it was before its squeeze liftoff this time if it occurs."
03/16/2021,stocks,I bought some $5 3/19 calls a couple weeks ago and got real excited when I saw that
03/16/2021,stocks,Just watch the trend. Crazy volume the last couple of open days. If it break $20 I’d watch it and pull out around $18 and buy the dip again.
03/16/2021,stocks,900+ by September. But only if you believe 🤘🏼
03/16/2021,stocks,"I came here looking for more info on this. XRT with a 16.03% weight ($127,209,225) of GME... I would certainly be interested if they recall. 

https://www.etfchannel.com/lists/?a=stockholdings&issuer=&symbol=XRT&sortby=&reverse=&rpp=20&start=2"
03/16/2021,stocks,Yes
03/16/2021,stocks,Yea hope so.  Cuz then us apes will be in a better position.  If it goes real low then our dollars will have more impact and we can take it up to the moon.  Seems like an obvious good strategy
03/16/2021,stocks,Thus is the benefit of “I’m not selling if it’s at-a-loss”. Patience rewards you
03/16/2021,stocks,Pretty weak
03/16/2021,stocks,Why put it in a meme stock...
03/16/2021,stocks,"If you can afford to, i'd wait until after this week at least."
03/16/2021,stocks,I would hold honestly. I was in the same position as you a few money's ago with $BBW. It took me a few weeks to sell at the top of market today. Sometimes it just takes time.
03/16/2021,stocks,"It absolutely is a real thing. If enough shareholders express concern of share manipulation, a company’s way of investigating is to recall to weed-out the naked shares. Or, more likely, is the company will have to address the “why is your company’s shares over 100%?” Question.

If you’re referencing GME, there is a chance that the new CFO could take that action, especially since there has been so much publicity around that topic. I wouldn’t bank on it, but the chance is there"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Not sure. But I went through something like that, at the start of COVID. A Natural Gas company I was invested in, was $350 a stock steadily rising. Predicted to hit $500 in the new year. Then covid-19 started murdering everybody's stock, and it plunged almost to single digits overnight.

When the company got taken off the market, they gave their investors a couple thousand more shares, which aloud us to make up some of our losses. Went from a couple thousand loss, to a couple hundred loss. Livable."
03/16/2021,stocks,The lack of transparency and government interference makes me too nervous to invest.
03/16/2021,stocks,Too much headwind with China regulations
03/16/2021,stocks,"I like it. Risk is keeping the price low for now, but when it breaks out it'll rocket."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Who would be purchasing at those prices because of reopening.  If you take a recent peak, summer of 2019 (Avengers endgame),  it was in the $11 range.  What have they done since then that they are financially a better company or what have they done that the forecast is for them to make more money(maybe hotdogs will now be $15)."
03/16/2021,stocks,Yep dats me. Zero karma all up in here and no clue how you get it. I'm too busy buying gme like a dolt and figuring out how to actually invest for the future.
03/16/2021,stocks,Lmao
03/16/2021,stocks,I got banned for a month because fuck the mods over there
03/16/2021,stocks,Definitely not me....🚀🌚
03/16/2021,stocks,"AMC, BB, GME"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Aurora (ACB) has been low lately, but it's been climbing back up steadily. Was $9 a share, last week. Currently it's $11.14 a share. It's predicted to hit upto $18 a share, before dropping, in the next few months. 

Short term gamble, while we all wait for Game Stop (GME) to drop again. REALLY wish I bought more than four GME, when it was low. Next time."
03/16/2021,stocks,Looks like a good move.
03/16/2021,stocks,DROP due to report still
03/16/2021,stocks,"For me its a coinflip at this point, this is a critical week for it
I’m holding 58 shares at $247. If it pops great, if not, oh well."
03/16/2021,stocks,Will probably trend down again tomorrow then shoot up Wednesday through early Friday and either ride that into the weekend or plummet when quad witching day isn’t what people assumed it would be
03/16/2021,stocks,I won't talk about GME's potential because at this point literally anything is possible. You could tell me tomorrow that the shares were going for 4000 or for -400 and either way I would not be suprised. The real question is: how many shares of GME does $1.9T get you?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Everything is an echo chamber right now. I think you should assess what you plan to do if you purchase or already own the stock. From the reports I have read it has ranged significantly to what value the stock should hold long term. I know there is a lot of hype about this Friday, but I am interested in their earnings next week."
03/16/2021,stocks,I really have no clue anymore. I paper handed at $118.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Back in Jan/Feb there was some valid research and thinking behind why it would go up.  There was some gambling involved but you had some things you could look at.

Now all that research and thinking of the WSB is over and there is nothing to look at.  So that means that either the stock is being purchase just among the same people and those who are getting in to make sure they get in (aka a bubble) or they are being played by the hedge funds.  Either way I would rather risk my money with the better odds I can get in a casino."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I've read all the DD and been reviewing the fail to delivers in the context of the public statements that short sellers have put out, and have a small position which is currently over 100% up. Its certainly a gamble - you could lose 80% of what you put in but Gamestop is very very far from going broke and the flipside could be literally unprecedented gains if it pays off and you have the cajones to hold through the turbulence. 

Specific timings and current fluctuations in price are irrelevant. The amount of blatant, visible manipulation going on with it as well as obvious psychological warfare gives me more than 50% confidence that it will play out positively - along with several potential trigger events happening over the next few weeks."
03/16/2021,stocks,"uhm, limit sells means it will sell once it reaches its target, you wanted to put a stoploss and but a limit sell.


So if its 210 or higher, it will sell. Thats why it sold.


a stoploss would sell if it goes 210 or lower."
03/16/2021,stocks,"had a nice little rip today, rest of the week should be interesting!!"
03/16/2021,stocks,I thought OSK already won this week's ago.
03/16/2021,stocks,GME puts lol
03/16/2021,stocks,I want to learn to buy calls I saw them today and I’m very confused... probably is for the better since I would lost ton of money if I knew.
03/16/2021,stocks,Let's bet on that. One weekly put every week until a small fortune is made
03/16/2021,stocks,"I have had a bumpy ride. First I bought into crypto and lost my rear. Then I pulled it out at a loss and bought AAPL, PLUG, ABNB, and TSLA. Lost even more... I did not have a lot  of money to start with. I had been hearing about GME on the news so I looked into it. I read news reports and studied it. From what I found I reached the conclusion that with financial institutions and mainstream investors getting involved this time around, and learning about short squeezes and gamma squeezes, I got in. I had immediate results, which was very gratifying for a change. To make a long story short I was up over 120% in two weeks. I have seen it go up and down since,  but I find it a lot less stressful when the change does not touch my original investment. Even after the terrible day yesterday I am still up 41%. Not bad for less than a month."
03/16/2021,stocks,I can definitely afford to and I don't mind holding anything for the long game. Thanks for the advice.
03/16/2021,stocks,"Sounds like I'm in good company anyway. Thanks, I feel better about giving it some time."
03/16/2021,stocks,"I appreciate the info. Can you provide an example of this happening? Id like to look into further.

Edit: I've looked a little and didn't find one. Nobody is able to provide an example."
03/16/2021,stocks,both upvoted.
03/16/2021,stocks,This guy fucks
03/16/2021,stocks,That is the spirit!
03/16/2021,stocks,Holy shit. Good luck dude.
03/16/2021,stocks,How did you get so much money if you act so goofy with it?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Sell at the 280 mark. I did, when it hit that. Might go up more. But it also might drop soon."
03/16/2021,stocks,3.50
03/16/2021,stocks,"actually there's a whole mess of research as manipulations abound...  


Of course it's as volatile as ever, so consider it a huge risk since noone knows where it's going from one day to another"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Ya I just found that out, guess it was better anyway looking at the price rn"
03/16/2021,stocks,ETF naked shorts to lower $ so their SI is lower
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yea, that floor of $40 is long gone. Too many people are planning to load up and hold after seeing a second round, I’d guess the new floor will be $70 if it does tank again."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Because people aren't 'collectively' doing anything, they're each making individual decisions on balancing their FOMO vs their risk tolerance and fear that the shorts may really have covered"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Im just looking out for my own money, idk about the ""movement"""

03/16/2021,stocks,"It's actually really easy... or at least the easiest stock option.

What app do you use to trade?"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yeah I bought at $252 today like a genius and this reminds me so much of the beginning of February. Obviously there are things that might drive it back up, but there is no buying rn."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Sorry if this is a stupid question, but... how do you make money with puts?

I understand the basic concept, i.e. buying the right to sell a stock at a certain price before a certain date. 

But I can't wrap my head around how that becomes profitable. Seems like, at best, you'd always just break even?"
03/16/2021,stocks,I was wondering because GME is very volatile and there’s no guarantee how the price will go. It’s just too risky. But it’s good you are making some money with GME. Remember to take some profits along the way.
03/16/2021,stocks,"yep, no worries. RKT's been getting a lot of momentum again. Many stocks are supposed to explode this week, but could also likely nothing happen(like last years quad witching hour). 

Though I guess AMC already has so far."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Risky bets payoff big, sometimes they don’t. And so life goes on. Don’t put more than 2% of your portfolio on risky bets."
03/16/2021,stocks,If you actually think holding GME right now is a goofy position then it explains why you think that's a lot of money.
03/16/2021,stocks,Just be advised the low volume of after hours makes it hard to fill an order
03/16/2021,stocks,"I’ve seen this narrative before when I was part of GME last time it squeezed. And we all know how that turned out. 

Pray to God it goes the other way for you lot but if by chance any of you who are reading and holding GME, be a smart investor; diamond hold only what you can afford to lose and ask yourself if you can really stomach whatever potential loss you may have/see in the coming weeks."
03/16/2021,stocks,Just found this too: https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m5vn6z/dtcc/
03/16/2021,stocks,My nipples got hard reading that
03/16/2021,stocks,"That’s not entirely true. There is a HUGE percentage of people on WSB who are first-time investors, you’d be surprised how easy they hop onboard the ape-train when it comes to GME. If people held through the drop from $340 to $180, back up to $280, then down to $205, and back to $220, I’d say there is a strong belief that GME will 🚀 with those people

Also, a big topic of conversation over there is all the catalysts coming Wed-Fri, I highly doubt those people will sell if they believe that 1 more day can make a difference"
03/16/2021,stocks,"Again, this has been going on for months. If people were afriad of shorts being covered then they wouldve sold already. People holding/buying now dont even care, they just see a volatile stock they can put their $1400 into"
03/16/2021,stocks,Im using fidelity and it’s not so simple lol 😂 I have watch tons of videos still don’t get it
03/16/2021,stocks,What's your strike price?
03/16/2021,stocks,"Yep, in February it also closed at 225 after slow bleed all day on a Monday. I see it bleeding more"
03/16/2021,stocks,If the market price falls below the put strike price then you can simply buy the stock at the market price and sell it at the put strike price.
03/16/2021,stocks,Oh really? Did you make your riches by ShOrT sQuEeZiNg tHe HeDgIeS??
03/16/2021,stocks,"Turned out going from 20 to 480. I got back in at 68 so I’m not exactly sweating. The shorts are still shorting, theyre still FTD. If that isn’t ringing bells that they’re still short over 100% of float..."
03/16/2021,stocks,"That’s the name of the game. Let’s say you have $10k invested. Which makes you more nauseous .... making $20k profit from selling and then watching it explode, or the idea of holding too long and losing all profit plus half your investment?  Scale up the amounts if $10k is toilet paper for you."
03/16/2021,stocks,"They were in the $11 range back in 2019 when they had Avengers:endgame.    

I like going to movies, I am not particularly fearful of covid and especially from getting it in a cinema since in the past I went during weekdays and usually had the place to myself or 2-3 other people.  However after \_black widow\_ there are not that many spring/summer films that I want to see this year because they are not being released."
03/16/2021,stocks,This is a Wendy’s sir
03/16/2021,stocks,"A call contact is always for hundred shares, which is important to know. 

You're paying for the right to buy those 100 shares at the price listed. So, a $5 Call gives you the OPTION to buy 100 shares at $5 a pop, or $500 total ($5 a share x 100 shares).

But that shit ain't free. Like I said, you pay to even have this option. That fee is called a premium. Let's say this $5 Call has a $1 premium, which is paid per share. So, buying this $5 Call costs $100 ($1 premium x 100 shares).

Now, how does this make you a profit? You need the stock price to go up to the point where buying the stock at $5 a share offsets the premium you paid. In this case, the stock would need to be more than $6 a share, because selling 100 shares at $6 gets you $600; likewise, you bought 100 shares at $5 each and paid $1 per share for the right to do so, and $500 + $100 = $600

Make sense?"
03/16/2021,stocks,$252 is the strike price
03/16/2021,stocks,"But that only works if the put is uncovered, right?

My broker doesn't allow for uncovered puts."
03/16/2021,stocks,I'm up six figures in shares I still hold and sold off about $35k of options so I'm pretty happy with it so far.
03/16/2021,stocks,"They didn’t have terrible inflation back then, so you cant value them as $11 IMO.

Also the movies will come back. Or do you expect people just date from home in the future? Lol"
03/16/2021,stocks,Yes all that I get and it’s easy to understand. I guess when I’m at the buying chat it’s where I get lose . And ended no buying . The chart where prancing in stuff is.
03/16/2021,stocks,"What is there about gamestop and their future that would value it at $25?

What they are proposing to do for future business is being tried by companies with more current business and they are not succeeding with it.  They are not going to offer prices cheaper than newegg or amazon, if they did meet the newegg prices, selection, and provided customer support I would probably purchase from them.  However matching the income from newegg would be a huge decrease from previous income."
03/16/2021,stocks,"You'll give that back to the market quickly, I'm sure of it."

03/16/2021,stocks,"Obviously anything is possible but like I said, I believe, antitrust effort, if any, will only be forward looking and very mild. They might tactically oppose any future big mergers but if history is any indication, even that might not happen irrespective of which party is in power.

Surprisingly enough, the most aggressive antitrust push of the past forty years came from the last administration (a lot of that effort failed in the judicial system, nevertheless it was a good faith effort). It's not because of the president or the top leadership but because of the person in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. 

Otherwise, both democratic and republican administrations performed exactly the same. Some of the most egregious monopolies were created under democratic administrations, again, not because that's what the president wanted, but mostly because of shortfall in bureaucratic competence.

That said, FTC is a civil agency with no real enforcement powers. That creates an unequal power equilibrium when a big tech company is on the other side of the negotiation table. They can occasionally issue some fines or ask for preconditions to approve an M&A, but that's all they can do. Unless the Justice Department is ambitious enough, nothing will change.

Also the judicial interpretation of antitrust issues are based on archaic reading of the Sherman Act, the primary antitrust framework. Unelected law professors basically rewrote the law in favor of big companies and everyone blindly follows that for some reason. The current Supreme Court makeup might challenge that in future cases but to see any real results, all the stars have to align and that's not going to happen in a meaningful way.

It you're a big tech investor all this is good for you, at least in the short run. If you're in a small to medium size tech, non-enforcement could be a problem as long the company remains small. Once it grows to be a category leader, you also would want no antitrust."

If interested you can also check out this from Naval Ravikant. It's more philosophical and everything in here doesn't work for everyone, you have to find your own path by making mistakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-TZqOsVCNM

Even in stocks, investing isn't for everyone. Some people are wired for daytrading. Some are swing traders, position trades etc. There are many ways to deal in the market. You have be self conscious and learn to know who you are, especially when you make mistakes.

Another interesting way is trading ES mini S&P 500 futures. Futures carry a lot of risks and is not for everyone.  If you want to learn this, DO NOT pay for any courses. There are lots of videos on the internet. If you want to try this, you can entirely simulate the trading with fake money - all software and data are real, just the money is fake. And all setup is free until you think you're ready to open a real account (if this is your thing). People consistently try this for months and IF they can show profits in simulated trading then they apply for real account. This is more of a regular income type thing than investing. Some people that get really, really good at this (very small percentage actually get good at this) do it before going to work like a side hustle. This is another option. Remember, many investors are not good traders.

DO NOT forget you'll lose all or nearly all of your capital in stock market initially, especially so if you're trading. I personally wouldn't put NO MORE THAN $500 initially because I know I'm going to lose it learning.

As always, investing and trading are not for everyone and they all carry substantial risks including loss of your entire capital or even more depending upon the instrument you use. This is not financial advice and you should always do proper due diligence yourself before making any financial decision."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Now besides the answer by Alertlog, if you want a quick way to learn patterns and other technical instruments, I recommend buying a book about swing trading for example, before I wasn’t looking at the technical side and confused about when to enter/exit but after reading some books it changed my perspective.

03/16/2021,stocks,"You're correct. It's the same idea as buying an index fund. Diversification is one of the main reasons why index funds are so popular. 

However, by constructing your own diversified portfolio, you get to pick your own winners (instead of the fund manager)."
03/16/2021,stocks,"Good observation but you're not exactly correct. Here's why:

Diversification reduces your potential returns but it also reduces the riskiness of your portfolio.

You can decide on the make up of your portfolio (etc. 70:30 tech stocks:others stocks or 50:50 tech stocks:other stocks) depending on your risk appetite. 

So if you have a bigger risk appetite and would like to take a bigger position on tech stocks, you just have to increase your proportionate holding of these tech stocks in relation to other stocks in your portfolio."
03/16/2021,stocks,I just posted evidence of a 19 year old who has sold $1b of his shares and has many more billions worth to sell if he chooses to?
03/16/2021,stocks,"You're correct!

Tech stocks are considered to be Cyclical stocks. Cyclical stocks are negatively correlated to Non-Cyclical stocks such as Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Utilities and Defense.

Hence, a well diversified portfolio will consist of a good balance of Cyclical (including tech stocks) and Non-Cyclical stocks."

It was probably just as speculative as Tesla was in its early years so it’s likely a good comparison as you were only talking about picking out a good tech company in its early years and investing and not selling. At least tsla was up in year 5 compared to year 4. Aapl might as well have been going under in 85 for all investors knew.

Msft has Azure and is ubiquitous in the business world.

I hold both at about 18% of my portfolio and I'm not worried.  They've been very stable.

Aapl has netted me a 34% gain since I invested almost a year ago and MSFT is a little over 15% and that's AFTER the tech rotation.  Even if the rotation continues, and I expect it to for a while, AAPL and MSFT will rebound and go higher.

For example if AAPL were to fall to 80 a share, which I doubt it will, I would easily buy 10 more shares.  If msft fell under 200, the same!"

03/16/2021,stocks,"Just so you know, depending on your time horizon this is a pretty suboptimal investing strategy. I'm going to ignore your brokerage account because I assume it's just for fun and you're not counting on big gains from it.

Your IRA: optimally, this ETF or mutual fund should be passively managed with a very low expense ratio. Over the long term, bonds are bad, so for maximizing returns this should basically be a mix of a US total market index fund and an international total market index fund. This is basically the only kind of fund you should own anywhere if your goal is maximizing returns*

Cash in interest bearing account: again, if your goal is to maximize returns with a decently far off time horizon, any cash sitting around is bad. It may smooth out market fluctuations, but it smooths out the ups as much as the downs. Since over the long term the market tends to move up more than it moves down, you're losing out on those gains. Some people like to keep 30% of their holdings in cash so they can buy stocks they like when they're cheap, but again, picking stocks is suboptimal.

*there are ways to get consistent higher returns than a total market index fund using factor index funds, but they're more complicated. Check out Ben Felix' youtube channel if you'd like to learn more. I recommend these two videos to start

After having both used and provided for all of the major driving gig apps. I can say Uber surely has a moat. Their service and app are years beyond any of their competitors. When you get a glimpse of the other side, you see there's a lot they do to give better service, and that it works

They have had rapid and consistent yoy growth with no signs of stopping. Minus coronavirus of course. But are on track to bounce back stronger now that ubereats has taken a foothold.

The lack of profitability is just to gain market share, which they have been doing hand over fist against lyft. Lyft is just losing money to stay competitive with uber, but not seeing the same gross increases. Last I checked, if Uber were to raise rates by $2 per service, they would be at a 20 P/E, bringing it well into healthy territory. But why stop right now?

I think their total rides will continue to grow exponentially for 3 years, as will their share price. Once they saturate they will turn into a dividend machine for the rest of the decade, until autonomous driving is functional.

My thought on autonomous driving is that we can cross that bridge when we come to it. But for \~8 years out it's golden"

03/16/2021,stocks,"If you buy a call or a put, the most you can lose is the entire premium.

03/16/2021,stocks,No need to play the elitist.
03/16/2021,stocks,Yes. If your income is particularly low you'd qualify for Medicaid.  There would still probably be a co payment on your prescriptions but I don't think there's a deductible.
03/16/2021,stocks,And when it comes to CSPX - which one should I choose? Euronext or London exchange?
03/16/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure about this, I'd check the exchange where the ETF has the highest volume and lower spread because it's easier to buy and sell. Also, a question is the ETF traded in euro in the EU and pounds in GB? Because in that case you get valuta fluctuations and you should buy it in your currency. Buy in euro if you aee paid in euro, or vice versa."

I know how an order book works, but this is a nonsensical analogy."
03/16/2021,stocks,"It's not either-or. It's both.

That's how an order book works.

The point of the story is that your actions affect the price, especially on thinly traded tickers; something you clearly demonstrated you didn't understand at the start of this conversation."
03/16/2021,stocks,"There is just no stock that is going to go up 10 cents from 100 shares bought - such a tiny amount. I think it may be you who doesn't understand how it functions in practice. Also, what is the relevance to technical analysis being valid or invalid?"

03/16/2021,stocks,"there are huge profits for everything pc related, them focusing on e-commerance, selling everything pc related, and making it very easy to customize ur own pc and have them send it to you pre built will make gamestops revenue double easily, gamestops customers will come back, everyone gets mouse, keyboard, mousepad, mic, pc part upgrades pretty regularly, whether its from them being worn down, breaking, or just wanting a different model,"
03/16/2021,stocks,"All this is easier said than done. At the end of the day their core business is selling games which are moving towards being only available digitally. They literally do not make enough money to totally pivot their entire business to focus on PC hardware and if they did they would just be adding on more competition like Best Buy which will crush them. People weren’t shorting GameStop so much because they hate GameStop, the writing has been on the wall forever and GameStop will not be able to adapt to the modern gaming market landscape. Honestly to be positive the best thing they have going for them is the fact that you can get older games there, but even then they have the reputation of not trading fairly for games which hurts their business."
03/16/2021,stocks,"end of the day they are focusing on e-commerance and will be selling everything pc related, dont make enough $? 7 bil average revevue for a companythay sells console games

ryan cohen isnt a ritard, gamestop can easily adapt dude... its not hard to focus on e-commerance and get into the the pc market"
03/16/2021,stocks,"people are going to buy dollar store food, and they think why would i hunt fresh food and do it myself when i can just go to the dollar store, gamestop is going to make getting a pc easier then it is at the moment, ryan cohen knows the pc market is 1000x larger then the console gaming market, they make 7 bil average revenue selling console games and other shit, their revenue is going to double easily by switching to e-commerence and selling everything pc related

Console rly isnt cheaper then pc, every game is like 60$ and you have to pay to play online on xbox, people know pc is the superior platform, they just dont want the hastle of building their own pc, and you dont only play games on pc, can do anything, people buy consoles bc its convenient and no effort, gamestop will make getting a pc convnient and little effort, console gaming is slowly going to die the longer the world spins, cheaper pc gaming gets the less people wre going to play console so switching to selling everything pc related is a big cock play"
03/16/2021,stocks,They haven’t turned a profit as a business since 2017. Revenue doesn’t mean anything if they have expenses and moving to sell PC related items will just make those expenses larger reducing their chance of turning a profit even more. And what does e-commerce even mean for them? If they sell online then they have EVEN MORE competition. I seriously cannot understand what you see that will magically transform GameStop into a totally different business than it is now that is also successful.
03/16/2021,stocks,"they have 7 bil average revenue for a “dying company” that only sells console shit, havnt even tapped into the 1000x larger market of everything pc related, have barely started e-commerence, and still had 7 bil average revenue, you think their revenue isnt going to atleast double in the next 2-3 years? why did CHWY shit on amazon? 

costo sells rotiserie chicken at a loss and puts it in the back of costco so you have to see everything, people customizing their pc’s and having them prebuilt and sent to them will also make them continue to spend $ at the store

“If they sell online then they have more competition” so miss out on billions in revenue because its not an untapped market...? wtf lmao

“we can see that ""E-Commerce sales, which are included in comparable store sales, rose 309% and represented approximately 34% of total company sales, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over $1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company’s $1.0 billion growth objective.""

It's literally just grinding simulated ninja combat over and over again for hours, for days for months to get virtual stat points and unlock gear that will never be used other than more grinding or that random time someone causes absolute chaos on your server via PVP cause barely anyone is interested in pvp. Everyone is focused on grinding and you're an ah if you want to pvp lol.

There's nothing to disrespect, they do it to themselves by playing these wastes of time. The naruto games on steam are far better, as bad as they also are."

I wouldn't say they're wastes of time as much as people spend their time on Reddit or YouTube. You should probably check out some more anime games though, it seems like you've just been exposed to the boring ones like Shindo Life. There's some decent anime Roblox games that don't get enough recognition."

03/16/2021,stocks,"A few things could happen:

1. They will give you the cash value of your shares. This is called cash-in-lieu, they sometimes abbreviate it as CIL.
2. They will round up your fractional shares to a full share. If you know they are going to do this, you can actually buy a single share and wait a few days to sell the new full share. Not every broker rounds up, here's a list of who does and doesn't (disclosure, I run this site): [https://www.reversesplitarbitrage.com/brokers/](https://www.reversesplitarbitrage.com/brokers/)
3. They could give you back a fractional share. $LEE did this last week, it's the first time I've seen that done and I've been tracking these since 2017.
4. They could round you down. This is rare, and is mostly done by foreign stocks.
5. They could sell all the fractional shares and donate them to charity. Tesco did this recently. Super rare.

1 and 2 are by far the most common. GE hasn't announced how they'll handle fractional shares yet. I've been tracking reverse splits for a few years, and I strongly suspect GE will do option 1 (pay cash). I'd say 90% chance they pay cash, 10% chance they round up."

Volkswagen on the other side posses many other car manufacturers as for example Porsche AG (which is the actual car company). If you calculate the value of Volkswagen back to what PORSCHE SE holds, there is a big discount when buying it instead of VW. So by buying PORSCHE SE, you will own the majority of VW and also Porsche AG. Burry did his research :)
Fun fact, if Porsche AG performs an IPO (There are rumors that VW will separate Porsche from VW to collect money), than Porsche AG might be already worth more than PORSCHE SE holding at the moment (The one that owns Porsche AG via VW and many more companies)..."
