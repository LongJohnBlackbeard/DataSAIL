2021-06-21 19:51:22,wallstreetbets,Deserved
2021-06-21 19:51:31,wallstreetbets,How late in the morning were you averaging down? At no point did you figure it was time to stop or cash out whatever you had left?
2021-06-21 19:56:27,wallstreetbets,"Why did you think SPY would go down after getting hammered on Friday?

I did the opposite, bought calls."
2021-06-21 19:49:36,wallstreetbets,"You ghey bear, you."
2021-06-21 19:54:32,wallstreetbets,Repo day isn’t even today what is wrong with you. Did you snort what Cramer was snorting?
2021-06-21 19:59:42,wallstreetbets,Perhaps you haven’t been around long enough. But stocks only go up. Bears days are long over.
2021-06-21 19:50:39,wallstreetbets,🤡🤡🤡🦧
2021-06-21 19:51:49,wallstreetbets,Sheesh 🙄
2021-06-21 19:56:33,wallstreetbets,"Started around 9:45 AM averaging down and within an hour I had lost $6000 and sold everything. Came back in the afternoon to try to make everything even, but was just in time for the afternoon pump."
2021-06-21 19:55:00,wallstreetbets,I like that everyone's bullish on PLTR. Helps me out on shares and calls. LFG!!!!!

2021-06-21 19:34:18,wallstreetbets,It’s funny to me because gme said the same thing to amc people and look what happened. Do not call wish a distraction when you ignored when gme people told amc people it was a distraction.
2021-06-21 19:31:42,wallstreetbets,Woops

2021-06-21 19:45:26,wallstreetbets,I didn’t know you could change accounts because I’ve never tried. But you know because?

2021-06-21 19:20:09,wallstreetbets,What are average moves on stock with these conditions historically?  Any numbers that prove this gives an edge?
2021-06-21 19:30:24,wallstreetbets,Ttcf all day
2021-06-21 19:46:56,wallstreetbets,All Fat's idea to look it up. I just spent so many hours on it I felt it was worth sharing with others. I spent enough time pulling it manually (a la copy & paste) I should have just learned to code instead lol.
2021-06-21 19:24:03,wallstreetbets,Well on average they dont necessarily shoot up all by themselves. There are a variety of factors that would contribute to a stock going up more or less on inclusion. I highlighted July call volume specifically because it would mean that an already good R2K inclusion play will get much better if there is a high july open call interest.
2021-06-21 19:59:32,wallstreetbets,"When Fat has an idea, we all make lots of money."

Hey OP, **positions or ban.**"
2021-06-21 19:03:44,wallstreetbets,Have 165 XOM contracts at various strikes for later this year and early next. Been in since December. Added $20k on the dip last week. Oil will only go up from here.
2021-06-21 19:06:13,wallstreetbets,"/CL to $100 by End of August, $120 By EOY!"
2021-06-21 19:45:14,wallstreetbets,"Enormous insider buys at RIG today, and all of last week. Loaded up big time on calls and shares (also USO). Going to be a fun summer."
2021-06-21 19:20:46,wallstreetbets,"Supply is going to shoot through the roof, apparently OPEC doesn’t expect large shale output from the US in the short term and it doesn’t seem they have any incentive to flood the market. 

100 is ambitious but I have a myriad of oil plays on deck so I’ll be happy to be wrong about “100 being ambitious”."
2021-06-21 19:42:25,wallstreetbets,"Wait.  Oil actually is going to be a little weak due to the news about China decreasing imports.

This will actually give an opportunity for travel stocks, specifically airlines and cruise lines to lock in cheaper oil rates.

Then it will trace upwards next month."
2021-06-21 19:39:37,wallstreetbets,Should checkout some of those companies drilling up on the north slope! I can’t name them but hint one starts with three E’s and then ends with NF
2021-06-21 19:08:40,wallstreetbets,Saw this on CMBC today but they failed to mention that the Saudis are upping oil production so doubt it hits anywhere near $100 specially afyer the Infrastructure bill passes
2021-06-21 19:17:18,wallstreetbets,Look who bought oil and is selling you the idea of boosting his own portfolio. This shit is so cringe. Why are we still here🤦‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-06-21 19:26:46,wallstreetbets,"You could see quite a spike if Iran feels the need to try and prove a point, but if nothing much happens, then the price increases that already happened could be as good as it gets for a while."

2021-06-21 18:49:18,wallstreetbets,"The only play on here that's a ""when"" not and ""if"". 
The forces at work for CLF in this moment have been years in the making."
2021-06-21 19:01:59,wallstreetbets,Solid DD. Bought 100 contracts this morning expiring next Jan.
2021-06-21 19:38:45,wallstreetbets,I never buy weeklies but I couldn't help trying to catch this week's $CLF upswing. 10 21.5cs today in addition to nearly 1000 shares and a handful of longer call options
2021-06-21 19:30:23,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the DD.  CLF shares make up most of my account.  

I don’t see an end it sight for demand on steel until all the supply chain shortages diminish."
2021-06-21 19:55:57,wallstreetbets,Bought another 400 shares of CLF putting me at 1400 shares today. Steel gang checking in 🦾🦾🏗
2021-06-21 19:06:06,wallstreetbets,LFG!
2021-06-21 18:46:32,wallstreetbets,"Great DD, bubba. I am already balls deep in $CLF. B-b-b-beast of a CEO. Great guy, never meddum."

2021-06-21 19:49:30,wallstreetbets,Largest steel producer in the US worth $20 a share? So undervalued it’s laughable
2021-06-21 19:51:13,wallstreetbets,I hope you guys do a good job hyping this up because I got a ton of calls for them and theta is kicking my ass.
2021-06-21 18:59:47,wallstreetbets,Ape see words. Ape buy the stock.
2021-06-21 19:37:55,wallstreetbets,Could someone please explain what a p/e ratio of -323 signifies?
2021-06-21 18:52:44,wallstreetbets,"That's why I'm planning this investment to be more shared-based than option-based. With options you can be right in the direction but wrong in the timing and lose money.

  I rather take a safer approach (which might not be correct for WSB lol)."
2021-06-21 19:34:13,wallstreetbets,What strike price did you get?
2021-06-21 18:51:24,wallstreetbets,"The CEO's quite a character. I listened to some old earnings calls and he kept blasting Wall Street analysts when they threw some questions around that companies are run on reality and not on spreadsheets, lmao. Which is totally true by the way."
2021-06-21 18:57:06,wallstreetbets,Brandon do you have any more stock advice. You inspire people with learning disability all over the world
2021-06-21 19:40:31,wallstreetbets,"It means nothing, only that the company has losses in the last twelve months."
2021-06-21 19:55:34,wallstreetbets,Also a freaking lovely theta gang play. Iv is high enough to pull 1%+ a week in decently otm ccs
2021-06-21 18:53:05,wallstreetbets,Also went all out war on short sellers. Corleone style. Dude has a chip on his shoulder. Appreciate the passion.
2021-06-21 19:36:22,wallstreetbets,"Tawlmbout thiccc boy investment club? Always bin into stocks, b. Axe J."
2021-06-21 19:42:26,wallstreetbets,Or that there's not much interest in the company? Just asking
2021-06-21 19:50:54,wallstreetbets,"P/E is just Price/Earnings, as earnings are negative it'll give you a negative number. And as such it doesn't mean much.
 
  It only means something when it's positive. But the company just went through two massive acquisitions, and 2020 was harsh given Covid and that the company depends a lot on demand from auto makers (and 2020 saw a decline on car production and sales). So that number means it had losses on 2020, that's all you can read into it.

  But 2021 and beyond looks promising.

  Hope that helps."
2021-06-21 19:53:49,wallstreetbets,Thanks for that👌👌

2021-06-21 18:39:37,wallstreetbets,I'll start buying once the dust settles. Underwriters and insiders have helluva lot cheaper shares at below-subscription price to unload via their deal. Both will probably unload a ton when lock up period ends. IPO price is already premium af!

2021-06-21 19:21:14,wallstreetbets,What’s changed for me?  I joined earlier this year. Nothing but down on everything I held. Moved back to my old strategy of not holding. Although I’m stuck holding a bunch of garbage I just need to dump it and cut my losses.  I did have a couple nice gains but wiped that out by holding
2021-06-21 19:31:37,wallstreetbets,Its all Carol Baskins fault.

2021-06-21 19:07:04,wallstreetbets,Playing options I assume?

2021-06-21 18:29:10,wallstreetbets,Risk averse
2021-06-21 19:33:18,wallstreetbets,Low risk tolerance.
2021-06-21 19:27:27,wallstreetbets,Me too.  Probably because I'm an Oklahoman and this POS  does not represent all Oklahomans. I'm not broke!!
2021-06-21 19:35:27,wallstreetbets,Can’t convince me it didnt happen

2021-06-21 19:43:10,wallstreetbets,"On the real though, that dude was a drug smuggler and almost definitely died as a result of it. The Baskin murder story was just too good to not put in the Netflix series, especially since Joe so firmly believed it"
2021-06-21 19:43:27,wallstreetbets,who else would know what seasoning makes human meat more appetizing for tigers?
2021-06-21 19:19:00,wallstreetbets,"Joe Exotic. Most famous from Tiger King on Netflix, but this is from several years prior when he ran for government. This is a political ad."
2021-06-21 19:17:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes.

I'll never recover from this financially"
2021-06-21 19:53:19,wallstreetbets,Iirc he didn't even have a liscence to fly

2021-06-21 19:23:36,wallstreetbets,Did he get elected?
2021-06-21 19:28:05,wallstreetbets,"Na. But you should check out Tiger King if you can. It was a cool cultural moment when the lockdowns first started and apparently everyone with a Netflix account said, “I guess I’ll check this out... what? WHAT? Wait- WHAT THE FUCK??”"
2021-06-21 19:54:27,wallstreetbets,"No. I don't think much came of his presidential run in 2016, but he was featured on Last Week Tonight and/or Tosh.O and I'm sure the publicity is what led to Tiger King. Honestly I haven't watched it, but I remember the ad well. Florida, from what the internet tells me, is a fascinating place"
2021-06-21 17:23:35,wallstreetbets,$9.3 million good god

smart apes will take notice."
2021-06-21 17:47:42,wallstreetbets,"Awesome DD, I'll make sure to screenshot this so I can read for later (just in case). Thanks for sharing again!

For anyone who worked in ad tech, they’ll all tell you that Aarki was a pure scam affiliate company, their tech is garbage, and the only reason they got picked up is because SKLZ believes (incorrectly) that they can somehow use the DSP data to circumvent Apple’s ATT."
2021-06-21 19:32:10,wallstreetbets,Holding 9 $20 calls Nov.  It was his been a roller coaster  .
2021-06-21 19:53:37,wallstreetbets,"Under $20 is a great buy in..but again, you gotta hold it and think long play not day to day or week to week gains. I literally monitor this everyday and now that it seems around $19 to $18 is a support level Im going to buy back in"

So what I’ve heard is as a player it’s difficult to make

2021-06-21 16:27:23,wallstreetbets,Amazon doesn’t need a lot of things… they’re still gonna try to acquire it. Basically they crave a borderline-monopoly in every piece of the monetary world.
2021-06-21 18:38:12,wallstreetbets,"Amazon, Walmart, and Apple all have made attempts to dominate the pharmacy industry. Unfortunately, the government has been discussing breaking up these mega-cap stocks and not letting them create monopolies in every single industry. Apple recently canned their healthcare ambitions and I would bet Amazon has done the same.

Walmart could pull it off because it's already part of their in-store operations. Only time will tell but for sure Amazon is itching to get into delivering medications too."
2021-06-21 16:43:50,wallstreetbets,"Idkkk. Rite aids are ghetto aff. But i can see amazon buying em competing with Walgreens and cvs. 

Gov is giving bezos money for space so if rad is bought the gov would prob help bezos down his pharmaceutical journey as well. Gov has a hard on for bezos."
2021-06-21 17:24:47,wallstreetbets,"Why go around the mountain when theyre halfway done digging the hole through it. Itd be a waste of money to not just revamp whole foods and instead buy out 2,000+ stores to offer the same thing a year earlier."
2021-06-21 17:38:30,wallstreetbets,"For the appearance of growth. The world operates on credit, and “credit checks” for monoliths grant them crazy amounts of leverage and who knows how much the gov gives them as a tax credit for employees giving a significant amount of the overall workforce whether directly or indirectly (contractors n stuff). In my opinion if Amazon expresses interest in doing anything, they will eventually.., full disclosure I have no positions in this, I just feel AMZN will do what it can to maintain growth opportunities. And if the sentiment on Rite Aid is low, it’s subjectively only growth."

2021-06-21 18:02:27,wallstreetbets,"""it’s because everything is under priced from it’s fair value.""

LOL its because JPow printed several trillion dollars into existence in a very short time frame."
2021-06-21 19:34:40,wallstreetbets,"Pretty weak, let me try.

Govment left the money valve full open since 2008. People really haven't experienced any kind of economic blossoming or something. It's been drag-ass poor down here for us plebians. 

So, banks have a low threshold to endorse a loan, and lots of people need loans cause they can't afford shit. Over the past 12 years, more and more capital and crucially real estate, roll into the pile of assets per banking institutions and liabilities per the public. 

Because the cost of production capital, real estate etc. are fundamentally beyond the capacity of the public to afford, the ""market"" for these assets is a closed one where institutions participate with institutions in isolation, and the value of the assets continues to increase healthfully for the investors, as the physical necessities of life drift farther and farther out of the public's reach.

Now we reach a stage where it is not necessary to to explain to a 20 year old that they will never own a home. They know it, it's obvious. Minimum wage is so far behind a living wage, that I would think it should be embarrassing to anyone who has their shit together and a comfortable lifestyle. 

A bifurcation of our economy is occurring, and the money is all on one side of it. Normal people can't afford shit. Normal people would experience a normalization of lifestyle if the value of all real estate in the country were to fall by 50%. That's the kind of situation the people at the banks and capital institutions have walked our economy into.

The currency is inflating because all of it belongs to the system man... People can't charge enough to keep their restaurant open because the rent to too damn high. The taxes are too high. The insurance is too high and the city bond is too high and the car payment is too high and and and... It's because the functional mass of our economy had no wealth in the first place. Had no... Means of production..."
2021-06-21 16:17:51,wallstreetbets,I like the TLT put play but what's your expiration on those?
2021-06-21 16:49:53,wallstreetbets,"Dude you lost me at “places are charging prices that are too cheap”…shit Is crazy expensive right now, and don’t even get me started on construction costs"
2021-06-21 19:33:56,wallstreetbets,"If cash is becoming useless whats the opposite of cash? 

That's right DEBT, so instead of inflation eating into your cash reserve make it eat away your massive mortgage debt. IE see the hot housing market atm. Thats where the smart money is going."
2021-06-21 16:18:01,wallstreetbets,I’ve been investing and coaching retirees for 30+ years.  Forever - yes forever- we learned and invested that equities were basically one of the few hedges against inflation.  Always works.  Yes - always.  Period.  Now they’re not?…. the “logic” in today’s world all-around is mind-numbing
2021-06-21 16:58:10,wallstreetbets,Time to load up on $CORN and $CANE
2021-06-21 17:11:15,wallstreetbets,"Also, when you are evaluating a company, also check for low p/e to debt ratio, low long term debt, and low price/free cashflow ratio. Lower debt and high free cashflow businesses are more competitive during inflationary periods.

One example of high free cashflow businesses are shipping companies, as in container ships and tankers. Marine shipping companies are basically cash machines. And because they're high cashflow, they tend to pay dividends, like really, really high dividends. I've been pushing marine shipping companies since last Fall, but no one really listens. But they've been multibaggers and the stocks are picking up steam as international covid barriers drop.

2021-06-21 18:06:21,wallstreetbets,Retard has a superficial understanding of economics. Probably read about inflation in cosmo and made up a dumb narrative. WhEn InFlAtIoN hAPpEnS bUy ComOdity lol. Don’t pick a miner with debt and net losses which would both be exasperated by inflationary pressures then. Supply side shortages are transitory CLF knows this too that’s why they aren’t running their facilities as full capacity because they don’t want to be left holding the bag when big boys like Mittal and Nucor who are operationally efficient ramp up production.
2021-06-21 16:20:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah puts on TLT and watch your money decay for the next two years.
2021-06-21 16:35:53,wallstreetbets,"Question, any reason you use TLT and not a leveraged fund like TMF?"
2021-06-21 17:21:47,wallstreetbets,How about going long TIPS and short Treasuries and just playing the breakeven rate?  Too dependent on CPI?  To high of a cost to carry the trade?
2021-06-21 16:52:06,wallstreetbets,"“In capitalism things should never be out of supply” is exactly the sort of thing a useless academic who has never done any real work in his life would say. 

In the real world, you don’t press a button twice to make twice as many things.

Also puts on bonds won’t work because having the Fed buy debt is the only way the government is able to spend unlimited amounts to appease the voters while the real economy shuts down, which is the real reason for shortages. When McDonald’s is having trouble hiring at $17 an hour you know people aren’t feeling the need to work."
2021-06-21 18:45:52,wallstreetbets,##I lost it at “you’re all retarded” so I’m out
2021-06-21 19:31:54,wallstreetbets,"What a stupid fucking thing to do. Most good stocks have bad days, but the market as a whole  eventually goes up in value, and inflation eventually drives that. Good luck timing the dip on a fucking index you assclown. Come cry and show some loss porn when you go broke with puts on a fucking index."
2021-06-21 16:53:18,wallstreetbets,What world do you live in where you think fair market value is higher than the prices of consumer goods and services. Its the polar opposite. Prices are running rampant and wages have been stagnant for decades.
2021-06-21 17:18:28,wallstreetbets,"Btw Steel play isn’t only an inflationary move. It’s more than that. In 2008 the steel stocks went astronomically high (clf reached 120$) due to the financial crisis. Today, the picture is completely different. The supply in steel can’t meet the demand (demand > supply). Plus, the Infrastructure bill is around the corner (CLF will wins huge from it). Rolled steel price are historically at the highest (CLF raising guidance every months). Cherry on the cake China is turning conservative with the commodities in order to boost  its own economy(cheap steel for Chinese only…) …. Despite all these catalysts, CLF is shorted ! Let’s make them squeeezeeeee"
2021-06-21 16:37:44,wallstreetbets,Balls deep on TBT.  Will be bumpy but unless we get locked down or economy collapses it will print
2021-06-21 16:54:52,wallstreetbets,"If commodities are the play wouldnt futures be better than options? (Never bought futures before, all i know is if i do, i want to sell the contract before expiration otherwise i might end up with 1000 barrels of oil at my door)"
2021-06-21 17:11:57,wallstreetbets,Thoughts on $X ? US Steel stocks
2021-06-21 18:12:11,wallstreetbets,How about calls on TBT instead?
2021-06-21 19:09:49,wallstreetbets,">It makes stock prices go uppies

Funny enough, I just watched a video on TD Ameritrade where a guys says the Dow was stagnant during the 1970's which was a time with high inflation.  Then he says at the end of the video basically the same thing a OP, ""stock prices go uppies"" and to invest in equities...

What am I missing here?  Too many neurons getting in the way?  Not enough beer?"
2021-06-21 19:25:24,wallstreetbets,GME/AMC ARE THE TRUE WAY TO HEDGE YOUR WELCOME
2021-06-21 17:40:11,wallstreetbets,%.%
2021-06-21 18:05:09,wallstreetbets,Which raises the fair value of products.
2021-06-21 16:31:40,wallstreetbets,He said in the comments September 17
2021-06-21 19:11:54,wallstreetbets,"Yea that's what Burry did as well, I've been looking at that... Considering a long term horizon though"
2021-06-21 17:52:25,wallstreetbets,That's because you haven't seen inflation at the scale many of us are predicting
2021-06-21 18:54:03,wallstreetbets,"Medium to long term they're good inflation hedges, short term they can still suffer drops as the prices of good and services take time to adjust across different industries. Also, different companies are affected differently by inflation; especially in regards to their valuation. Growth stocks where expected future cashflows make up a good percentage of their valuations can get hit hard by sudden changes in inflation expectations"
2021-06-21 16:26:56,wallstreetbets,"Which is why PMs fell so far out of favor.  This is why people keep buying the miners instead of the metals.  Then the metals don't move and all the miners fall back down.

Also, all the central banks would much prefer you bought equities instead of metals, particularly gold and silver.   They've done a good job of making sure that gold and silver aren't treated as ""money"" by the investing world.

And CLF is an equity, BTW."
2021-06-21 16:31:06,wallstreetbets,I think I believe the other guy your comment history is shit! Lol…. So yea what expiration on those puts good sir?
2021-06-21 18:37:19,wallstreetbets,"Use TMF = 3x TLT. Your logic on TLT seems sound but it looks like it is actually increasing so calls are paying not puts.

The Feds have been actively buying and rates have been historically low so TLT has already dropped a ton."
2021-06-21 18:36:57,wallstreetbets,"I'm doing that and it's going poorly.... Don't know why, might double down."
2021-06-21 18:52:15,wallstreetbets,"This is the only way to play on inflation. Commodities have been known to be poor hedges against inflation for quite some time now, and that can easily be seen just looking at recent price action."
2021-06-21 16:58:51,wallstreetbets,No you retard. You don’t press a button twice to make twice as many things. You sell it for twice as much so you stop being sold out. You know. Inflation.
2021-06-21 17:18:33,wallstreetbets,"OP meant in the context of market demands and I think he was right.  He did not mean what is ""fair"" to consumers.  Consumers and employees get screwed in this kind of environment."
2021-06-21 18:46:52,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what you're smoking, but steel stocks fell with the market in late 2008/early 2009, and came down a lot harder than the rest of the market, only rising in the first place thanks to increased housing demand, which subsequently ground to a halt. It wasn't inflation, but rather floods of Queensland, which severely disrupted global supplies of coking coal (major steelmaking ingredient), that caused the rise. They accounted for 50% of the global coking coal supply, so no surprise as to why steel reached such heights, before eventually plummeting.

Right now, there isn't a shortage that affects 50% of the supply, maybe not even one that affects 5% of the supply. Until there is, expecting to see them numbers again is crazy."

2021-06-21 17:07:20,wallstreetbets,Most brokers don't allow futures trading.
2021-06-21 19:28:36,wallstreetbets,There’s also future options
2021-06-21 18:39:23,wallstreetbets,Kind of the same thing as puts on TLT.
2021-06-21 18:43:49,wallstreetbets,"Valuation is determined through price discovery, the medium of exchange is but one factor. You make it sound as if the inflation tsunami triggered an automatic revaluation of everything."
2021-06-21 18:44:41,wallstreetbets,Or leads to shortages
2021-06-21 19:23:14,wallstreetbets,Yea I saw. It makes too much sense
2021-06-21 18:30:18,wallstreetbets,Fiat currency isn’t real. The fed won’t allow it to breach 3%. You’re wrong.
2021-06-21 16:34:22,wallstreetbets,All I know is that yield curve is normalizing… better hope that inflation fear trend continues even though that news is 4 months old now…
2021-06-21 18:53:36,wallstreetbets,"hahhaha InFlaTiOn, ComOoDiTieSS. You're so smart mr smart buffet geniis person"
2021-06-21 17:14:56,wallstreetbets,"Never heard of a purchasing contract, have you? Have fun trying to make capitalism work without that.

Also all sorts of goods have inelastic demand. People aren’t going to eat half as much food because the price is higher. 

Only dumb motherfuckers say shit like “there shouldn’t be shortages” in any situation. The real world has shortages."
2021-06-21 17:08:18,wallstreetbets,Im on TastyWorks and TD. TastyWorks approved me for margin and futures
2021-06-21 19:30:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah but my understanding of futures is that it doesnt have theta decay like options do. It just more or less obligates you to either buy the commodities at expiration or sell the contract before expiration.
2021-06-21 18:50:05,wallstreetbets,The fed doesn't have real-time perfect control over inflation. They're the rudder on a row boat where the rowers on either side do whatever the fuck they want and the water can abruptly change viscosity.
2021-06-21 19:01:00,wallstreetbets,You must trust the govt and fed…
2021-06-21 18:42:19,wallstreetbets,"This. This is exactly what happened during the 70s. 

Price shot up, there were attempts to control the price, hence there were shortages all throughout. People could not get meat for days on end, and no this didn't happen in the soviet union. At the same time, cattle ranchers refused to sell the cattle at a loss so they just refused to sell. 

If the price does not reflect the increases in production cost, the producer can withhold the product or in some cases destroy the product if it is perishable goods, leading to shortages."
2021-06-21 17:25:44,wallstreetbets,Lucky! Fidelity doesn't let me do futures :(
2021-06-21 17:28:59,wallstreetbets,I applied for an options upgrade on TD and they approved it but I didn't complete the application cause I think I just want to keep it as a cash account so I can spam options as much as I want all day. I'll leave the margin and futures options on TW
2021-06-21 18:51:53,wallstreetbets,This is absolutely incorrect. If you can’t see that it’s rigged you obviously haven’t been trading very long. Once you get a decade under your belt talk to me.
2021-06-21 19:02:22,wallstreetbets,"In order for the fed to maintain control over inflation they have to be proactive; but the current extended low interest rate environment has made the economy highly reliant on cheap debt. They haven't raised rates yet, which signals to me they aren't going to until it's already too late."
2021-06-21 19:23:48,wallstreetbets,"People have been saying this since 2011. I’m not saying there won’t be another recession, as the market is cyclical and this naturally will happen. My point is the game has changed. It’s not 1999 anymore. They’re fucking with all the numbers to the point that they essentially have a game genie code on the economy, and guess what else? It behooves the global economy, especially the EU, for the American economy not to collapse, so they all play along. It’s a new age in the market since the QE of the Obama administration."
2021-06-21 16:13:06,wallstreetbets,Bro it's a new week.

2021-06-21 17:14:59,wallstreetbets,"WISH bagholder here. It does not have that high of short interest like other popular meme stocks. The term short squeeze is way overblown and over used by so many idiots on stock twits and here. Not saying you are an idiot but I wouldn't throw the term short squeeze in here. It's like every stock that goes up people are like ""short squeeze"" no its just a lot of people buying it lol."

Someone brought it to my attention and didnt want to post it on wsb because he didnt wanted to be looked at as a shill.

2021-06-21 18:37:51,wallstreetbets,"Anyone wanna brainstorm as to how we'd incentivize people to create DD for varying tickers and not more of the same? I was thinking maybe make a bot that rewards a DD post if it stays up for at least 24hrs with a subreddit-specific award that'd show in your little stats readout on the bot's DD replies and give you reddit gold. Y'know, like the pee martini, but different.

Or maybe a listing of DD auto-generated and put in the daily thread's description but it only picks the top performing DD for a ticker if it's got multiple DDs?

Any ideas? Think it's worth doing at all?"

What kind of wealth do you actually hope to accrue with your 'diamond hands?'

A) Just one big score to pay for a birthday gift, Christmas, get my parents something nice, etc.

B) Constant smaller wins that will get bigger the more money I put in. I think I could become a trader and quit my job eventually.

C) Life changing money ASAP. I'll never have to deal with Terry's shit again. Can't wait til the last time I ever step foot in a Wal-Mart.

D) A specific value goal you believe is achievable and then you're gonna fuck off forever because you're an activist and think the market is broken. (This could mean 10k cash, 100k cash, or maybe a return like 500%, please specify.)"

I applied for $10k CC consolidation as my 0% APR CC offers are about expire in 2 months. I can pay it off with my assets, but then I would have to pay taxes on the sale of those assets which is not ideal. UPST offers 27% APR with the origination fee. My CCs will be 22.68%… Hard pass."

2021-06-21 18:51:22,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you’ve distilled it down to 2 options:
1. Blow a bunch of money on a Vegas vacation with an online romance you’ve never met in real life who may or may not either (a) be a man or (b) be scamming you. Chances of getting laid I would say are 1-2% for you here. 
2. Blow a massive fucking hole in your account by holding a dog shit stock. Crunching some numbers, I would say chances of getting laid in this scenario are around 0% for you. 

As a caveat to option 1, 12 year olds are unfortunately not allowed to drink or gamble despite Vegas’ reputation as “sin city”, so your potential activities/dates are mostly limited to aquariums and magic shows. Could be fun. Do your research."

2021-06-21 16:48:11,wallstreetbets,"The best advice I can give you is to unsubscribe to this sub. Go to TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, or Investopedia first. Learn the basics. Look at index funds first. Learn the staples through investor services of buying and selling general stock. Watch YouTube videos, anything except WSB. This is an extremely risk-on environment and is not suitable for the majority of people. Get the fundamentals in place first. Learn what market capitalization, sectors, growth v value, cyclicals, etc. all that means before you YOLO anything"
2021-06-21 16:50:57,wallstreetbets,"Start with index funds. SPY is most well rounded, QQQ (nasdaq) is all tech, and DIA is mixed but more weight on the industrial side than the tech side.

Pay attention to major market factors of the time. Right now it's inflation, 6 months ago it used to be vaccine rollout. Know when the Fed meetings are and when key numbers around inflation are released so you know what days to expect volatility.

Learn options. This isn't the sub for that but youtube has lots of videos explaining them and strategies using them.

I'll save you a lot of time and money by telling you to trade option spreads instead of anything else. Don't know what those are? Look them up and learn the strategy. You'll thank me later"

You could buy it back for half the price and keep the other half, which people do often to open new positions sooner, especially if there's now higher IV strikes that are only a little more risky, or just to ensure profit when your thesis changes to bearish (so you're not holding shares for a loss when the company crashes)."

2021-06-21 18:05:09,wallstreetbets,They both cost about the same
2021-06-21 18:24:28,wallstreetbets,Just out buying more sugar water i suppose. Although he did say the cicadas were making it hard to get butterflys on the ding dong.
2021-06-21 18:54:07,wallstreetbets,"Oh she definitely a girl. 

Also $WISH ain't dogshit. 

Damn a magic show sounds fun."
2021-06-21 18:40:50,wallstreetbets,"GreenOaks shares were labeled Class A not Class B. I think someone contacted ORTEX for an update.

So the float is a lot smaller than we previously thought. A new filing from CLOV in their risk section says that short exposure exceeds the number of shares of their common class A stocks.

Edit; I’m not sure if I can list links from other subs on here. 

Go on CLOV subreddit or Stocktwits a lot of good DD

Edit 2: also class B can be converted to class A but they would loose some of their voting rights. I highly doubt they would do that if it’s a long term hold."

“A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A common stock that largely exceeds supply and/or focused investor trading in anticipation of a potential short squeeze have led to, may be currently leading to, and could again lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A common stock.”

2021-06-21 19:12:01,wallstreetbets,I got in an argument with an alcohol snob about it who insisted they were different I told him Scotch is actually called Scotch-whiskey
2021-06-21 18:18:49,wallstreetbets,The sad part is it’s not even a meme stock
2021-06-21 19:19:52,wallstreetbets,☹️
2021-06-21 17:48:21,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't buy either tbh. WSB will be dumping wish soon... If not tomorrow, later in the week."

2021-06-21 19:08:29,wallstreetbets,Way undervalued. Put the house on it
2021-06-21 16:46:44,wallstreetbets,100% shares. Would do calls but honestly I’d rather spare myself the stress + shares are the best way to contribute to the stock.
2021-06-21 16:47:51,wallstreetbets,Very very long
2021-06-21 19:39:24,wallstreetbets,He probably got his knock off medicine avocados from wish.com
2021-06-21 17:56:09,wallstreetbets,"Were you not here 2 weeks ago when it surged up similarly, went +100% AH and basically erased all gains by open?"

2021-06-21 17:07:17,wallstreetbets,I generally spam them when I see them.

2021-06-21 19:52:17,wallstreetbets,Do yall take profits early typically in theta gang or go balls to the wall and wait til expiry
2021-06-21 18:02:31,wallstreetbets,"It’s a gradual increase this time around, not a sudden jump"
2021-06-21 16:57:32,wallstreetbets,It’s a slang term for weekly OTM options…  back before we had 8 million people who joined that only buy shares.
2021-06-21 18:23:03,wallstreetbets,"That whole process is what is commonly referred to as sweating, so at best this is an argument about semantics. You could be a pedantic bitch about too though, I guess."

2021-06-21 16:06:33,wallstreetbets,I'm not feeling good about it.

2021-06-21 17:00:42,wallstreetbets,If the mods ever decide to flair me that should be what they put. I am literally dying of boredom.

2021-06-21 15:50:41,wallstreetbets,They removed that stock from robinhood.
2021-06-21 16:04:42,wallstreetbets,"You know, at this point, using Robinhood and complaining about some shit like this is the equivalent of using Wells Fargo and getting pissed because you got some BS charge. The “terms and agreements” are pretty ironclad. You don’t have a gripe."
2021-06-21 15:49:26,wallstreetbets,They don’t support that stock anymore. Probably in the agreement if they decide not to support a stock they have to give you notice and if you don’t close your position by X day they do. I doubt they would execute this without having it in writing to protect themselves.
2021-06-21 15:48:55,wallstreetbets,Were you using margin?
2021-06-21 15:50:15,wallstreetbets,If only people had given warning to other to stop using Robinhood and use a big boy broker. That really sucks you got screwed but you were playing with fire.
2021-06-21 16:01:39,wallstreetbets,"Even Robinhood doesn't want you using Robinhood. They are telling you to switch to a better broker like you should have done a long time ago when they pulled the same thing with GME and AMC

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
2021-06-21 15:52:36,wallstreetbets,Get a real broker ffs. They cant be trusted anymore.
2021-06-21 15:50:18,wallstreetbets,"Use shady services, win shady prizes."
2021-06-21 16:08:13,wallstreetbets,"Its in Robinhood agreement when you open an account. If a stock you purchase and hold on robinhood is no longer carried or supported by Robinhood they notify you and give you time to transfer or close the position and then do it for you if you don't do it. 

This is why you should read what you sign up for, and not arbitrarily check the ""Accept Terns"" box and then ask questions later."
2021-06-21 15:49:22,wallstreetbets,were you on margin or something?
2021-06-21 15:50:49,wallstreetbets,Stopped reading at “Robinhood”
2021-06-21 15:53:38,wallstreetbets,"Same shit, different day. Have you been living under a rock? Robinhood doesn't give a fuck about you and will do what they want, per usual. Get off the dog shit app and get on a real platform like TD Ameritrade."
2021-06-21 18:00:23,wallstreetbets,Even Cash App is her than Robinhood.
2021-06-21 18:17:12,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood pulled some fuckery . No way!! Alert the media. This is shocking, they are usually such an upstanding company /s"
2021-06-21 15:51:17,wallstreetbets,Lol people who use Robinhood.
2021-06-21 15:49:07,wallstreetbets,So glad I closed every position I had with that shithole company.
2021-06-21 15:47:57,wallstreetbets,F* Robinhood
2021-06-21 15:52:32,wallstreetbets,I use tdameritrade. Been using it for years. No problems.
2021-06-21 15:51:05,wallstreetbets,Imagine still using Robinhood?...
2021-06-21 15:50:20,wallstreetbets,Did you have a limit sell?
2021-06-21 16:54:23,wallstreetbets,"In Soviet Robinhood, options close you"
2021-06-21 15:53:15,wallstreetbets,"Wow, this might be what gets me to close my account with them."
2021-06-21 16:06:19,wallstreetbets,You see a fire and you throw your wallet in there and then complain about losing your money and credit cards... yeah. That's about it for this situation.
2021-06-21 15:50:14,wallstreetbets,The biggest question here is: why are you using rh? Srry dude but thats just retarded seeing the shit they pulled with gme
2021-06-21 16:03:30,wallstreetbets,If you are still in robinhood at this point its your fault man..
2021-06-21 15:52:56,wallstreetbets,"If you were using margin account and not cash account, it's not completely RH's fault if you couldn't keep up with the maintenance or cushion margin."
2021-06-21 16:06:39,wallstreetbets, it says its not supported on RH
2021-06-21 16:42:30,wallstreetbets,You are an idiot for still using Robinhood. Wish post like this would convince people that they are a scam broker but probably not.
2021-06-21 17:11:25,wallstreetbets,">uses robinhood

>gets rug pulled

It takes 5 min to set up a Fidelity account"
2021-06-21 17:19:31,wallstreetbets,Your fault for using robinhood.
2021-06-21 17:21:38,wallstreetbets,"You must like having a hard life. It absolutely baffles me that thousands here got rekt by Robinhood this year and they still use the app because it “looks nice.” 

This is a message to all you retards because I love you: Have some goddam self-respect and leave that shitty platform already for fuck’s sake."
2021-06-21 17:30:19,wallstreetbets,Why does anyone use Robinhood again???
2021-06-21 15:49:35,wallstreetbets,Sounded like they robbed from the rich to give to the poor.
2021-06-21 15:56:16,wallstreetbets,"Why are you still on robinhood? How many times must they actively fuck with people's money before you realize you shouldn't trust them? Like, one of the most famous losses here on wsb is because of rh not properly defining the risk on box spreads (and the user's own stupidity). They don't even know what the fuck they're doing. Leap years have lead to outages. Volatility on the canine corn leads to outages regularly. They SHUT DOWN BUYING on volatile stocks and lied about the reason back in January. They weren't the only ones to prevent buying, but they blocked it the longest and lied about why. It took a federal hearing for them to even come close to admitting what really happened, and then were rebuffed about it by the DTCC.

Like, if there was ever a place to put your financial trust in, they definitely are not it."
2021-06-21 16:44:17,wallstreetbets,Wow.  This sucks.  Everyone here is going to be an A-hole but I feel ya.  I personally use Interactive Brokers.  Check it out.
2021-06-21 16:49:28,wallstreetbets,You dumb idiot. Get off Robinhood jackass
2021-06-21 17:52:37,wallstreetbets,Everyone who is mad at this and doesn't switch brokers if they are currently on the hood is not very wise
2021-06-21 18:57:19,wallstreetbets,Probably ur a retard for still using rh
2021-06-21 18:58:59,wallstreetbets,Reason #834 to ditch RH! Everyone needs a real broker.
2021-06-21 19:27:31,wallstreetbets,Thats on you for STILL using robinhood.
2021-06-21 19:54:00,wallstreetbets,Don't tell us we didnt warn you retard
2021-06-21 15:48:14,wallstreetbets,"Very odd,"
2021-06-21 16:18:04,wallstreetbets,Robinhood that steals from the poor and gives to the Rich ...
2021-06-21 16:30:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I think I found your problem… It’s the first word in your title.  Wrap it boys, case closed."
2021-06-21 16:33:30,wallstreetbets,I’m sorry to say this but you get what you deserve for using that service.
2021-06-21 16:42:15,wallstreetbets,looks like you learned what a margin call is the hard way
2021-06-21 18:21:49,wallstreetbets,🤔
2021-06-21 16:11:25,wallstreetbets,"That seems like something that should be easy for the rep to either know or find out. I was a broker, stuff like this happens and it’s not hard to discern the situation regarding a specific security

Read the email that was sent, check the internal news system, check the mainframe...any one of those would give that rep an answer rather then just saying “idk we emailed you”"
2021-06-21 16:53:44,wallstreetbets,More like boa
2021-06-21 17:46:09,wallstreetbets,This.
2021-06-21 17:50:30,wallstreetbets,"Also, how could he call? They don't have a number.

Also, how many fucking times has he read ""get off robinhood"" on every stock sub on reddit?"
2021-06-21 16:13:25,wallstreetbets,What's as easy as Robinhood? Webull looks like I need to triple my autism to understand.
2021-06-21 18:23:51,wallstreetbets,"Play with the house app, don't be surprised when they sell you short."
2021-06-21 17:47:03,wallstreetbets,Robinhood stopped selling the stock through it's platform. They emailed op and told him and then kicked him off the stock.
2021-06-21 15:53:37,wallstreetbets,Same.
2021-06-21 17:39:56,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Very happy with these people.
2021-06-21 17:47:21,wallstreetbets,Robinhood stopped selling the stock through it's platform. They emailed op and told him and then kicked him off the stock.

2021-06-21 17:45:37,wallstreetbets,The fact OP held an unsupported stock and ignored his emails and in-app alerts?
2021-06-21 18:19:24,wallstreetbets,This is what it takes? Removing a stock off their platform? Not their blatant market manipulation by turning off the buy button on certain stocks in January? Yikes.
2021-06-21 17:47:28,wallstreetbets,Robinhood stopped selling the stock through it's platform. They emailed op and told him and then kicked him off the stock.

2021-06-21 17:23:22,wallstreetbets,What’s great about IB is you don’t have to worry about PFOF because the people who own IB are the ones doing the paying. You’re literally on a platform designed to front run your orders in house.
2021-06-21 16:14:13,wallstreetbets,Don't think I'm taking much risk here in saying this post probably doesn't accurately depict how the situation actually played out.
2021-06-21 17:20:40,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood doesn’t know how to do anything properly, I’m not surprised their CS rep doesn’t know shit."
2021-06-21 18:39:09,wallstreetbets,"It's BofA. 

If they want to willingly attach themselves to a ridiculous abbreviation I'm not one to argue. 

BofA can lick bofa btw."
2021-06-21 18:16:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, at this point it’s kind of just a *shrug* moment. 

Like asking Pablo Escobar to be your banker and then being surprised when some of it goes missing and you end up in jail for unwittingly trafficking coke. 

It takes 24-48 hours on average to transfer to a real brokerage. It takes about 25 minutes of your time to do so. 

There is literally no excuse other than “I don’t give a shit about my money.” And if that’s the case, then stop bitching about it when they fuck with your money."
2021-06-21 16:26:56,wallstreetbets,Webull
2021-06-21 18:15:45,wallstreetbets,"so if they stop selling the stock, are you at least given x amount of time to transfer your account to another broker?"
2021-06-21 17:43:53,wallstreetbets,Same same
2021-06-21 18:26:01,wallstreetbets,Oh wow 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
2021-06-21 18:23:49,wallstreetbets,Yep. And now that I know that OP was informed about the stock being removed I will happily continue to use RH![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|kissing_heart)
2021-06-21 17:25:44,wallstreetbets,"Yea, necessary evil I guess.  What platform do you use yourself?  Have not had the time to fully research but I do know IB is reliable from my own experience.  Was thinking getting into ThinkorSwim as well."
2021-06-21 18:42:03,wallstreetbets,They still are professional rip offs no matter their ridiculous abv
2021-06-21 18:22:23,wallstreetbets,">There is literally no excuse other than “I don’t give a shit about my money.” And if that’s the case, then stop bitching about it when they fuck with your money.

Sir, this is a casino.  And Robinhood is the house."
2021-06-21 18:17:27,wallstreetbets,"Not op, but if I received an email, it's probably the bare minimum amount of time to prevent you from going to another exchange. Like, if it takes 5 days, I would send it on the 6th day."
2021-06-21 17:28:33,wallstreetbets,"Schwab, which is also
PFOF. 

Retail traders are screwed. We thought no commissions was a good thing."

2021-06-21 17:30:36,wallstreetbets,Think long-term and the small bit of scalping that you get hit by doesn't matter so much.

That was the original perfect example of the rot in the system."
2021-06-21 16:10:13,wallstreetbets,When I say end up. I mean that eventually one man owned all the shares and he had no one to buy and sell.
2021-06-21 17:29:19,wallstreetbets,"Well he did...they just changed the rules 'cause they were getting screwed.

And the point they used back then cannot apply here since there millions of owners of these shares. Not a single entity"

2021-06-21 15:44:13,wallstreetbets,"You'll take all the gains and all the losses in your taxable accounts and it will be your total capital gain (or loss).

Read this cuz the first comment someone posted is like 1 half right and there is a LOT of wrong in it.

[https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409)

&#x200B;

Lets say you start with $1000 and traded 50 stocks and made $1000 (total $2000 in your account).

Then with your $2000, you YOLO'd into a meme stonk and sell with weak hands and lose $1800. Now you have $200 in your account

At the end of the year, your capital loss is ($800)

&#x200B;

Lets say you didn't do anything... you have $1000 capital gains.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

THE INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION IS NOT TAXED. whoever said it in an earlier comment is not right. You do NOT pay taxes on the transactions. You will pay taxes at the end of the year (or quarterly) combining all gains and losses. Like RH, or any broker is not taking out taxes for you."
2021-06-21 15:52:38,wallstreetbets,"The trick about taxes that the IRS doesn't want you to know is to buy high, sell low."
2021-06-21 15:43:40,wallstreetbets,What a good question.  I’ve been thinking the same but didn’t know how to search. I was just being retard waiting for the IRS to send me the bill.
2021-06-21 15:41:34,wallstreetbets,"You are taxed on your realized gains and losses in a year. Wash sales and long term vs short term gains are things to consider. This is really not the place for basic tax advice on investing. It's something worth googling and reading about.

On your first question, yes if you closed the positions you are taxed on the net $100 gain. On your 2nd question, what you are describing is called dollar cost averaging and it is a very basic investing concept."
2021-06-21 15:50:03,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck kind of question is this doing in WSB where’s the auto mod at,"
2021-06-21 15:38:25,wallstreetbets,"It depends. If your scenario is you invest 10k into 1 stock then it goes down to 9k then it recovers to 10.1k without you ever selling the initial stock, then your taxable is only 100. If you sold at 9k then invest in another stock at which point you make 1.1k for a exit at 10.1k then you are taxable for 1.1k. However, you have a yearly threshold for deductions based on your losses, meaning that your initial loss of 1k is deductible and therefore you actually tax amount is less

Point is that tax is calculated per transaction 

Hope that helps"
2021-06-21 15:43:54,wallstreetbets,They do it to try to maximize profits. Without regards to risk. If you wanted to decrease risk you also wouldn’t invest your whole portfolio into one stock.
2021-06-21 15:48:02,wallstreetbets,"My current understanding is below, disclaimer: I am not a tax accountant and this information could be wrong.

Tax on capital gains are taxed somewhat on an individual basis but also on a whole.

One of the basic things you can do is use capital losses to “offset” capital gains so long as they are the same category (ie both short term or long term losses and gains).

So in your example, if the loss of $1000 and the gain of $1100 are both in the same year and both are short term then at the end of the year you would have to report both transactions and your bottom line tax basis would be $100 short term capital gains. If they are in different years there are ways you can roll over capital losses to later years but I haven’t done this before and this don’t know a lot of the specifics."
2021-06-21 16:01:00,wallstreetbets,Depends a little on where you sold and bought back in. There is a wash sale rule that can affect taxable gains/losses if you buy back into the same position w/in 30 days of closing it.
2021-06-21 18:43:42,wallstreetbets,"It's net gain but it's complicated. If you traded all in the same stock over a short period of time then it's going to be like 2.1k taxed possibly. Depends on a bunch of things but overall typically just the net gain is taxed, again, unless you are trading the same stock frequently."
2021-06-21 17:38:19,wallstreetbets,I dont have to worry about taxes in my moms 401k so i cant answer your questions. Have a good day sir.
2021-06-21 15:43:54,wallstreetbets,The answer is 42
2021-06-21 16:00:57,wallstreetbets,"This is only true if OP trades 50 different stocks. If OP keeps trading the same stock without waiting 30 days then wash sale rules apply. 

So in your example, if all those trades occurred in December with the same stock then OP would be taxed on all profitable trades (so possibly more than $1k) while loss trades would be deferred to the next tax year.

You can really fuck your tax situation if you’re not mindful of wash sale rules."
2021-06-21 15:45:35,wallstreetbets,"Also, why do peoplenot average into a position, well that's on the invidiual. There's no way anyone knows if the stock is going up and down over time. Some people will buy all at once, or buy in incremental, dollar cost averaging, it just depends. 

&#x200B;

What if you average in and keep buying highere and higher and then the stock tanks?"
2021-06-21 17:06:18,wallstreetbets,"Let’s say I bought 10 shares of GME at $20 back in Jan. Then I seek 5 shares of GME at $300 each. With those $1500 I go buy some 250 shares or AMC at $6 and I decide to hold on those tendies to the moon. Now my question is, will I get taxed by holding, those shares?"
2021-06-21 15:50:51,wallstreetbets,This isn’t accurate. Look up capital gains/losses offsets.
2021-06-21 16:09:15,wallstreetbets,BUT this only applies in December… Wash rule doesn’t really matter any other time of the year except right before tax season unless you’re holding stuff long term.
2021-06-21 15:46:26,wallstreetbets,"Also, check ou the turbotax question and answer section, good FAQ and scenarios and videos for everyone to learn

https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/investments-and-taxes/"
2021-06-21 19:00:41,wallstreetbets,Got to watch out for the wash sale rule if you buy within one month of when you sold.
2021-06-21 17:45:33,wallstreetbets,"no you are only taxed on what you sell. the tax calendar is jan 1 to dec 31. so anything you gain or lose money on between that time, will go for 2021 taxes, due 4/15/22 (unelss they move the date again).

&#x200B;

if those are your ONLY holdings. you are taxed on 1500 minus your cost basis (3x20 = $60). so taxable gain is on $1440. doesn't matter if you bought AMC or not. That's why they always say to leave $ for taxes. cuz if AMC goes down, or if you want to hold AMC forever, you'll still need some $ in April to pay for the taxes from selling GME.

&#x200B;

Now there is long term vs short term gains on taxes too, you can google that. 

&#x200B;

Also, that's why a lot of these articles talking about bezo or elonn making all this money becuse the price of their stock went up doesn't make sense.. they didn't sell all their stock. its unrealized gains."
2021-06-21 15:53:24,wallstreetbets,No it is accurate. Indeed look it up
2021-06-21 16:16:05,wallstreetbets,"Not really, if you have make a series of trades that trigger wash sale rules and never close out the last trade or wait until December to close out (i.e. you went long) then all losses get deferred. Similarly, if you swing trade a stock all year long, including in December, you would have to defer all losing trades and pay tax on any profitable trades."
2021-06-21 16:19:37,wallstreetbets,Wash rule applies any time you sell and buy the same stock in 30 days.  Not just the month of December
2021-06-21 17:02:35,wallstreetbets,Wash sale applies immediately... won't get hit until tax season but doesn't mean it didn't happen
2021-06-21 15:56:37,wallstreetbets,"I did look it up, you can pay extra taxes if you want I guess."
2021-06-21 16:28:28,wallstreetbets,Right so what I’m saying is just stop swing trading by December and you’re good to go for the next year.
2021-06-21 17:10:06,wallstreetbets,This only applies for securities you hold through to the next tax year.

2021-06-21 16:43:39,wallstreetbets,"I was working on my own $BIG DD over the weekend, interesting to see this one take off. For my .02, I think the fact that they still have over 10% of market cap left in the buy back, SI 16% (ortex) and institutional ownership is something like 106% of free float are good indicators for the WSB crowd. They're also severely under-valuded compared to competitors, NTM P/E is 9-10 compared to 18-20 for most in the industry. If you want a real head scratcher, take a look at OLLI (P/E >27), which is about the closest competitor in terms of market cap. OLLI does about half as much in earnings and has a market cap of 2.5x BIG."
2021-06-21 16:00:26,wallstreetbets,"$BIG pays a dividend, and has a P/E ratio under 4.  Seriously undervalued.  Compared to Walmart and Target, Big Lots pulls in an impressive amount of revenue, especially for its relatively small market cap."

Walmart and Target were low on cleaning stuff and paper towels/tp but Big Lots was out of everything. I stopped bothering with them for a few months because I assumed they had distributor problems.

2021-06-21 19:27:35,wallstreetbets,Not sure yet. Im gonna watch tomorrow and make a decision. If it starts to run Ill probably go short term. If its low volume Ill play it long 2023

I get all my cleaning supplies cheaper than Walmart, for the same shit and no Fucking Mutant Walmart drama to deal with"
2021-06-21 15:59:21,wallstreetbets,The mega mart in idiocracy is a Costco.

2021-06-21 16:06:22,wallstreetbets,"Haha, I kinda enjoy the mutant drama at walmart, it's sometimes absolutely absurd what kind of people make it to adulthood. A really greasy walmart has almost a controlled chaos vibe that you can't get anywhere else."
2021-06-21 18:12:06,wallstreetbets,Dirty empty stores? Say no more fam. Im in!

2021-06-21 17:17:36,wallstreetbets,"“...there’s no one in there...” 

So probably not the best investment if no one shops there, right? But I actually do like my local Big Lots, too. I feel like it’s underrated"

2021-06-21 15:50:49,wallstreetbets,I can’t stop buying $CRSR stock.  Way too undervalued
2021-06-21 19:54:05,wallstreetbets,"I didn't read your post ( yet ), but I came to the same conclusion as your title as I was doing my own DD today.  I had dismissed it as a meme stock for a while, but now see that it's both a growth and value stock while still somehow being a semi-meme stock.  

I honestly didn't think that was even possible.  Generally value goes out the window when anything comes close to meme level.  I don't do YOLOs, but took up a solid position in it today.  We'll see how it plays out."

2021-06-21 16:29:12,wallstreetbets,"I will buy a few.  First USD stock that I will try to buy.  As I only use CDN xchanges, it can get expensive. 
I have been looking to buy this...following. 
As a novice in the market, I came here to see “what’s up”.  Each mentioned stock, I research my way.  Main question is how expensive is it to run a particular company.  I stay away from high physical expenses.   This stock Looks good to me with less downside.  
Maybe I won’t go to the moon 🌙

2021-06-21 15:29:40,wallstreetbets,Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh… mmmmmmhhhhmmmmmm

2021-06-21 16:10:47,wallstreetbets,Isn’t student loans their bread and butter though? Who’s refinancing right now since federal loans have had payments and interest stopped.
2021-06-21 17:59:35,wallstreetbets,"I has SoFi account. It's OK. Rates are a little higher than a lot of other places on the credit side, deposits are average rates. Decent rewards. Don't keep much in it, mostly I leech rewards, convert it to the C-word and wait for a pump so I can dump and withdraw fiat to move to one of my other investment accounts.  Been waiting a little to see what happened with the IPO, but I've got my limit orders set to DCA my current position of 2 shares."

2021-06-21 17:21:28,wallstreetbets,"Where did you hear this? I was under the impression that there wouldn't be much student aid help for those who REFI'd with private lenders. 

Side note: as much as I hope I'm wrong, I don't think there's any chance we get any student loan forgiveness relief (minus the guys who were scammed but that's already been approved)"
2021-06-21 18:55:28,wallstreetbets,"Not happening. That is far down the list on Biden’s agenda and he won’t have the political capital to get it done. 

Clean Energy bill and infrastructure will come first, so better to invest in TSLA and various contraction or raw materials firms."
2021-06-21 16:36:43,wallstreetbets,"Thats the thing they don’t just do student loans they’re a one stop shop for everything. Home loans, more recently auto loans, insurance, credit cards, Galileo, their brokerage, and soon money from bank deposits."

Apparently the president of the company sees more gains in Turkey hunting than RIDE.  That should tell you something about the likely success of this turd."
2021-06-21 15:37:33,wallstreetbets,Don't forget Schmidt cashed out right before earnings in Feb for 8 million... EX- CEO is about to unload 25% of float in a couple of months.  LMFAO if you think this is going anywhere or has a future.  No investors are going to invest when they know 25% of float is about to dump.  Best PUT option I've ever bought.  35K of Dec $7.50 :)
2021-06-21 16:17:04,wallstreetbets,"The company is a scam. Today news hit the media that all the executives had sold their shares in February prior to bad news hitting the market.

  RIDE's president sold all his share to finance his new 'start-up' of a turkey hunting farm in Tenessee. Well, the company has a problem if its president think that a farm acreage in Tenesse will have better returns than its operations."

2021-06-21 15:12:06,wallstreetbets,Apple has sucked for a long time imo. To each their own tho.
2021-06-21 15:34:49,wallstreetbets,You think apple is screwed because they don't have the parts to fix your phone?
2021-06-21 15:57:47,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the country.

Anywhere in Europe Apple can change their t and c’s all they like and i just laugh with them for 10 minutes and then just show them European consumer law on the nearest iPad 

They tend to go get the new one out the back fairly quickly after that.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/europa.eu/youreurope/business/dealing-with-customers/consumer-contracts-guarantees/consumer-guarantees/indexamp_en.htm

EU law also stipulates that you must give the consumer a minimum 2-year guarantee (legal guarantee) as a protection against faulty goods, or goods that don't look or work as advertised. In some countries national law may require you to provide longer guarantees."
2021-06-21 15:18:47,wallstreetbets,Apple has sucked but their cult following won't admit they have problems and will eat up every new product while never using the full capacity of even the iPhone 5.

2021-06-21 15:20:08,wallstreetbets,"Shortage of semiconductors means shortage of iPhones, or replacement phones in your case. Shortage of replacements means, they had to change their policy to fix not replace. Delays in shipping due to the strain the pandemic has had on the broader global supply chain means you have to wait for the parts for your phone’s camera to be fixed."
2021-06-21 15:17:31,wallstreetbets,However that would explain why they have stopped issuing replacement devices.
2021-06-21 15:27:15,wallstreetbets,"Makes a lot of sense on the shortage effecting replacement orders. 
I thought you were eluding to the fact that semiconductor shortage equals camera shortages. And i wasnt tracking.

Because my puts (sells) started filling at 10ish strikes... meaning it will probably find a way to be dangerously close to 10 as we approach expiration.

2021-06-21 16:50:44,wallstreetbets,"Just like NVDA, some super bullish news comes out and it doesn’t budge. 

Then, randomly, a few days later, it rockets up 10%-20%. 

That’s my prediction with this too. I’m down 20% on my LEAPS now but holding. THIS STOCK SHOULD BE DOUBLE WHAT IT IS NOW.

I’m about to go all in on AMD if I see volume picking up."
2021-06-21 15:05:58,wallstreetbets,"This is the way, apes. Don't sleep on this investment opportunity. Take a look at AMD stocks 5 year performance (up nearly 1,600%) and average analyst price target ($104.34). This is a great value with plenty of room for growth. AMD is catching up with the big dogs and she is primed for lift off."

2021-06-21 16:56:52,wallstreetbets,"Xilinx was announced last year. It will complete this year. AMD was at $99 a couple of months back. But it has been trading sideways, consolidating a new base.

Now, with the recent clients, events, products, technologies, it is expected to breakout once again. The consensus analysts target for year-end is $110, although I expect it to be $130.

The revenue growth for 2021 was adjusted in April, after the $110 target price was reached.

To summarize, it will go up with or without Xilinx."

DLSS is NOT on TESLA

DLSS is NOT on Stadia (Google Cloud gaming)

DLSS is NOT on AMD APUs

2021-06-21 16:36:25,wallstreetbets,"DLSS is yet another of NVIDIA's attempt to create a niche market for consumer abuse and anti-competitive practices.

They did it with G-Sync, charging stupid prices for Monitors.... but lost.

They tried it with GeForce Partnership Program (GPP), which was flat out criminal

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce\_Partner\_Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_Partner_Program)

So yeah, now they created some fancy sounding closed software (DLSS) while attempting to charge ridiculous prices for their GPUs.

Unreal Engine's Lumen and Nanite on UE5 (one of the 44 studios supporting AMD's Fidelity FX Super Resolution) has already made ray tracing possible in a much more convenient process. So yeah, DLSS will fade away, just like G-Sync and GPP.

Be ready to be impressed tomorrow..."
2021-06-21 19:15:08,wallstreetbets,AMD just need some GPU's out there comparable to NVidia offerings...

2021-06-21 15:55:09,wallstreetbets,They arent bad either.  Not sure why you have such a disposition towards X.  I do think CLF has some decent return potential as well.   Not really measuring companies against each other though and dont really need to.
2021-06-21 15:27:16,wallstreetbets,this. dont buy the news on steel even if the news is a dip
2021-06-21 18:14:27,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it kinda did. Most or these steel companies are up >100% in the last year. That's a pretty big run-up for a commodity. Whether it continues to go up from here is anyone's guess, but HRC futures continue to rise, inflation is becoming unignorable, and demand continues to outpace supply."
2021-06-21 15:58:46,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I have End of July calls.   Ended up having 100 Contract Puts by circumstance which paid out really well.   pumping profits into equity and then reversing to do 100 contract Calls"
2021-06-21 16:05:43,wallstreetbets,Clf is just way more liquid and x is low volume
2021-06-21 15:57:33,wallstreetbets,"Ive not been a fan of US Steel as a company until i saw they paid off some specific notes.   a few years ago, they screwed the workforces pension hard, but it seems like they paid off some debts which allowed them to catch up on it.   So while i fundamentally had a negative disposition towards them because of that issue, I was going to give them a shot since they did use some of their income this year to get caught up on it.  Better late than never?"
2021-06-21 18:18:10,wallstreetbets,What stock isn't up 100% in the last year..I'll wait...
2021-06-21 18:23:19,wallstreetbets,"Well, just to name a few of the popular ones on here: WISH, CLOV, RKT, UWMC, WOOF, WWE, etc.

I think a more important metric is how an individual stock compares to a particular index, like SPY or VTI.

Almost every steel stock outperformed the broader market over the last year. That is significant."

2021-06-21 15:01:02,wallstreetbets,Webull ipo center it’s easy to read
2021-06-21 14:51:05,wallstreetbets,60% of IPOs don't go up in a one month timeframe. Underwriters and insiders get subscription shares for much much cheaper as they make a deal so if anything usually after lock out period ends insiders tend to sell to lock in gains while giving up more control to institutions and public. So that's why it's best to buy after lock up period ends. Don't expect to make money buying IPOs on their first day because institutions were push up the price a bit more than IPO and then once retail ants climb in they all dump it on retail.

2021-06-21 15:35:35,wallstreetbets,I would have collected the premium anyway bruh lol so i would have gained 300 dollars or somethingl ike this.

2021-06-21 15:12:48,wallstreetbets,"Nope, I bought in at a little over $10 and set a trailing stop.  I'm not here to bring anyone down, just throwing out that maybe people shouldn't be proud of holding the bag and plan an exit.  Not every stock is a squeeze spitting out millionaires left and right.  Look into enough meme stocks and the pattern is pretty consistent is all I'm saying"
2021-06-21 15:19:44,wallstreetbets,">Currently on a facetime call with a friend who has a Bloomberg terminal. You have no idea wtf you are talking about. There is a shit ton of shares to cover for shorts with less than 591mm outstanding

lmaoo he's mad he didn't buy the bottom and sold too early and now don't want to get back in at higher price hahahaha that is classic example of how not to trade lol"

2021-06-21 16:29:51,wallstreetbets,"Calling China communist at this point is a little off the mark. It’s complicated.

I’m bullish on BABA, there’s a lot going for it. And generally I am leery of China stocks, but not an outright hater. A few have done very well for me. They play a loaded game over there, though, no denying that."

2021-06-21 14:38:33,wallstreetbets,Once they raise interest rates we are heading for a economic collapse.
2021-06-21 14:49:20,wallstreetbets,I think your last point hits the spot. My bet is that rates will be raised some time end of next year and the bond market seems to be betting on that as well
2021-06-21 14:47:00,wallstreetbets,*transitory collapse
2021-06-21 15:22:57,wallstreetbets,You’re absolutely correct’ don’t let any retards tell you otherwise
2021-06-21 18:36:14,wallstreetbets,Check out the big brain on this one! What if the economy collapses before they raise interest rates?
2021-06-21 14:31:56,wallstreetbets,Bought 200 at 5.22…. I’m hoping this moons lol

2021-06-21 15:24:29,wallstreetbets,This stock has not yet returned to its price previous the pandemic. And this year it signed 2 new contracts for long term (10 years )
2021-06-21 14:40:00,wallstreetbets,I am not selling it until it reaches 8$
2021-06-21 14:48:33,wallstreetbets,I think you still got it at a good price. Last year the average was about 8$. And this year already signed 2 major projects for 10 years
2021-06-21 16:44:46,wallstreetbets,They signed those 2 contracts for the Driftwood project 🍀
2021-06-21 18:00:40,wallstreetbets,Average down maybe?
2021-06-21 16:37:22,wallstreetbets,What price did you buy it?
2021-06-21 15:22:14,wallstreetbets,they also diluted a lot. 5 dollars is equal to 8 last year.
2021-06-21 16:58:02,wallstreetbets,"Well, that made me hold my heavy bags for longer!"
2021-06-21 18:06:00,wallstreetbets,Not a terrible idea but I'm tapped out right now. Content to see what happens over the next while
2021-06-21 17:00:09,wallstreetbets,Expensive! $6.50. Trading in Frankfurt can be tricksy because 6.50 usd = 5.47 eur and we talk in dollars here.
2021-06-21 15:31:13,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, but I did not see any news about that. Do you have some article on this ?"
2021-06-21 15:33:17,wallstreetbets,"Plus, it was past 5,3$ last week already after the news of the second contract."
2021-06-21 18:10:54,wallstreetbets,You could sell calls if you wanted to bring down your costs a bit. Just a suggestion. Could use that premium to buy cheaper shares. Just a thought. Or just keep the cash.
2021-06-21 17:10:42,wallstreetbets,You bought it before the pandemic? I did not see it having this price since the pandemic
2021-06-21 15:35:52,wallstreetbets,"I am just warning you about comparing values... I have 180 call contracts... I like the plan. However, I hate when people don't adjust for dilution."
2021-06-21 18:58:52,wallstreetbets,"Europoor - no calls available on it on degiro. I appreciate the suggestions, though. Thanks for taking the time. Unfortunately I get to assimilate the lesson 😪 

I'm not in too deep and its been a fairly good year so far so I can afford the education"
2021-06-21 18:04:50,wallstreetbets,I managed to buy at the very highest peak in early June. Youre  in the presence of bagholdong greatness!
2021-06-21 15:39:46,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, but you're reply is not convincing. How did you get to the conclusion that the 5$ price is equivalent to the average of 8$ from last year?"
2021-06-21 18:17:14,wallstreetbets,I didn’t write the dd. Do the research yourself. They went from 250 million to like 400 million shares.
2021-06-21 14:56:17,wallstreetbets,Give that man a slice of Ukraine

2021-06-21 14:49:06,wallstreetbets,Very disappointed the SC refused to hear the case.
2021-06-21 14:26:19,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think the generic (in this case) will “harm” it just may not do as much “good” - the 20% variation is 10% above and 10% below. It’s misleading to state that someone will only get 80% of original branded strength. The generic costs about 40-50% of the Brand, however generic availability appears to be an issue currently."

I buy in because i see a ""perfect chart"" based on past experience then right after I buy it drops 20%. Then when I do the opposite it still loses :(.

2021-06-21 14:24:47,wallstreetbets,Op can’t count 4 words. I must trust him with numbers. Putting in $20k now.
2021-06-21 18:10:16,wallstreetbets,"""Pretty much a sure thing"" ❌

""Can't possibly go tits up"" ✅"
2021-06-21 13:54:05,wallstreetbets,"""If it sees that you don't usually buy products at that price point, it'll drop the price (without fucking telling the seller, but that's a story for another day) and offer it at 89.99 with let's say 9.99 shipping."" 

Honestly, this is sketchy AF. If you're not checking shipping prices that's on you though."
2021-06-21 13:44:19,wallstreetbets,LONG WISH
2021-06-21 14:30:14,wallstreetbets,"Funny, my colleague said sth similar. Seems legit. I am all in on WISH. Literally."
2021-06-21 17:06:20,wallstreetbets,Shit site.  Shit products.  Shit customer service.  **IM IN!**
2021-06-21 15:06:56,wallstreetbets,"Plus 70% of purchases were originated via the home page and related products. 70%!!!!

Search is dead"
2021-06-21 14:09:26,wallstreetbets,I hear wish has the highest quality products that are just as advertised
2021-06-21 15:06:23,wallstreetbets,"It could be the best stock in the market today, long with 7500 shares. Dont be surprised if hit 30 before end of year"
2021-06-21 13:42:05,wallstreetbets,Yea I just spend £10K on it after reading all the shit people posting about it.
2021-06-21 13:51:58,wallstreetbets,Bought 500 dollars worth just now god I hope this works
2021-06-21 16:37:57,wallstreetbets,"Imagine how much data Context Logic is racking up just from people scrolling and browsing. Aside from e-commerce, WISH would be making a ton of money from selling just that. I doubt a majority of people even read the TOS."
2021-06-21 13:59:31,wallstreetbets,"Agreed! I said this many times now, this is not a pure ecommerce play. This company is a data science company which will become a logisitics giant. Why do you think Peter Thiel of Palantir invested in this?"
2021-06-21 19:48:41,wallstreetbets,"I want to be punished for not buying this earlier. I threw in $10K this afternoon at $13.00 .. i was tied up with AMC. I know, I know. I'm a retard, I know please send me to a corner. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)"
2021-06-21 13:57:58,wallstreetbets,I’ve been on a lot of WI$H threads. And been telling people to look into a little deeper. Got plenty of down votes from haters and shorties. This BISH WI$H will keep going up! Let’s GOOOOO!!!!
2021-06-21 13:53:50,wallstreetbets,So how much can we expect it to be by end of week or end of month?
2021-06-21 15:16:19,wallstreetbets,"Everyone keeps shitting on Wish because it has shitty UI and bad products but it is generating $$$ revenue despite long shipping times (caused by covid). So what happens to sales when they fix their UI, list better products (they've got europoors on the job), etc? 

Obviously you want to buy low so you buy it now, well I bought in at $11 because I didn't hear about it earlier. I don't expect it to moon to $100 but it'll probably trade comfortably between 13 and 20 which is good enough for me. I can sell $40 calls for $2, that's literally over 10%"
2021-06-21 13:54:01,wallstreetbets,"This shit right here. Who cares about bots, shills, fud whatever this stock is going places and this is the time to get in at a solid price. I got a 11.61 price average and that was cheap af for this

Again I don't care if you think its shit, I'll risk it anyways. 

Careful if you sell calls, this stock could move hard and make you miss out on bigger gains."
2021-06-21 13:54:36,wallstreetbets,Wish? The fucking website that advertises all that weird low quality shit on FB? Gtfoh
2021-06-21 15:59:22,wallstreetbets,"My impression of Wish was, and still is, AliExpress but sketchier/worse. I can't deny that it's pretty popular though."
2021-06-21 14:51:16,wallstreetbets,Wish is a shit platform. Outside of the meme this product is absolute shit in every imaginable way. Pretty sure their server runs on diesel
2021-06-21 14:47:07,wallstreetbets,"One problem not mentioned here is that Wish still has significant problems with it's actual product listings and service.

Shipping the wrong item, having extremely poor customer service afterward, selling counterfeit goods, even more mushroom brands than Amazon, etc.

If they can't deal with those problems, their business will never make it past novelty stages, which is largely where they're at right now."
2021-06-21 15:09:36,wallstreetbets,Cheap low quality products w 9 month delivery and after that its either the wrong product or no product.. tried it twice and deleted the app
2021-06-21 14:35:47,wallstreetbets,Everything I’ve ever heard or seen about wish is how terrible the products are. Investing in this seems like throwing money away
2021-06-21 14:27:05,wallstreetbets,"I’ve given up with wish, everything on that site is below shit quality but still there are plenty of morons who will buy from that website still"
2021-06-21 14:59:23,wallstreetbets,"> 4 Words: Covid killed global supply chains.

That's 5 words, clearly you can't be trusted."
2021-06-21 18:18:14,wallstreetbets,COVID brought Amazon to new all time highs because in store shopping shit the bed. This DD makes literally no sense.
2021-06-21 14:55:31,wallstreetbets,For an ecommerce pro you talk a lot of BS
2021-06-21 17:42:13,wallstreetbets,"Wish in the UK is fucking trash, anyone who buys from that place has unfortunately gone full retard"
2021-06-21 18:42:57,wallstreetbets,"GME going down and a flurry of ""wish is the greatest nothing ever"" this doesn't sound anything like ""AMC is the best thing ever"" or ""clov is the bet thing ever"" or my favorite "" Rkt is the best thing ever""."
2021-06-21 18:59:09,wallstreetbets," Total pump n dump, have fun skydiving

Most of the business expenses are for sales & marketing, meaning they shower you with cupons and beg you to stay long term, but you won't because the platform is junk. 
Just open and account and go ""shopping"", see how you feel about it

Read the 10Q, view the expenses, they are burning cash from financing for no long term growth"
2021-06-21 14:40:07,wallstreetbets,"Can’t go wrong when you make a $WISH!

Also really hoping $CBDL makes a come back because they have an Amazon store now and shares are cheap"
2021-06-21 16:02:27,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 how stupid are you?
2021-06-21 15:18:37,wallstreetbets,Wish is completely worthless vaporware
2021-06-21 15:49:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you're right, it's a sure thing to lose your money on."
2021-06-21 16:52:06,wallstreetbets,I stop reading at “strong contender to be our Chinese Amazon” ENOUGH SAID 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-21 17:36:41,wallstreetbets,NEXT STEP $25 SHARE
2021-06-21 18:33:05,wallstreetbets,"Hello, thoughtful eCommerce insider.  Hmm, I want to be excited about this.

Three questions: isn't Alibaba considered the Chinese amazon?  

 Is Wish comparable to Alibaba?  

Is the algorithmic pricing you're referring to much different than Alibaba and competitors?

Thanks"
2021-06-21 19:05:48,wallstreetbets,"Have any of you used wish? I used them 3 years ago. Ordered a fuck ton of stuff super high for like $100. Half the stuff got to me a month later. Most of the stuff that actually made it did not match the pictures and the quality was so cheap I seriously threw away half of the shit after I opened it. 

The other half of the stuff just never came. 

Fuck wish. Never using them again. Maybe they’ve improved but I doubt it."
2021-06-21 15:12:49,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the financial advice
2021-06-21 17:01:33,wallstreetbets,Yep! Who needs YOLOs when you can meme and dream? And $WISH!
2021-06-21 17:14:12,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure any stock hyped as a ""sure thing"" is anything but"
2021-06-21 17:14:20,wallstreetbets,China already has an Amazon….
2021-06-21 18:01:49,wallstreetbets,So youre saying stocks....go up?
2021-06-21 18:26:50,wallstreetbets,"As someone that ordered from wish years before covid, covid is not the cause of the long shipping times."
2021-06-21 18:47:30,wallstreetbets,Have any of you actually bought anything from WISH? If you had you would be investing in it...
2021-06-21 19:14:03,wallstreetbets,Oh I see major long-term potential in this. My only question. Do you think this covid investigation could stall progress further?
2021-06-21 14:23:01,wallstreetbets,** 5 words
2021-06-21 19:36:10,wallstreetbets,"Bruh... their website is absolute shit and i just made a new email and logged in there and the first thing they advertised me penis oil and vaginal cream.  I dont think this shit will be all you think. But hey, apparently amc is worth 50-70$ a share"
2021-06-21 13:55:22,wallstreetbets,"Its sketchy for sure but its playing the consumer. Just like free shipping isn't free, it's been worked into the price of the product instead."
2021-06-21 16:26:29,wallstreetbets,"Amazon does the same shit. 

I got a prime day deal on a chair in my wish list. 

I click it thinking “oh awesome” 

It’s the same price. They just pumped the “before” price and pretended its a deal."
2021-06-21 14:56:34,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah it's super sketchy I agree with you. It's a ""grey area"" in my industry. People do tons of shady shit (cough selling refurbished as new, cough). Me personally, I'm not comfortable from a seller perspective because we always have total control over the price. And this fucking company does it and doesn't tell you. Not racist or anything, but does it seem weird to you that a lot of shady companies are Chinese? I trust Chinese people with my life, but their companies and government are terrifying.

China has this unbelievable sourcing ability however. They have an entire city dedicated to tech parts for the west. China is basically if the individual revolution happened now, had modern tech, and will regularly disregard the law if it seems it's inconvenient lol. So the sketchyness here imo I attribute it to its corporate roots. Still good to invest in though ha."
2021-06-21 17:01:26,wallstreetbets,"Is it really, though?  Is it any sketchier than weird pricing structures to manipulate the feeble human mind?  Or raising the price by $10 and offering free shipping in the opposite direction?  Or marking up a product by $20 to then offer it on 'sale' for $20?  


I mean it's not like the bad old days when you got auto signed up for something at a monthly charge becuase you had to click to opt OUT of it?

It's just basic selling psychological tools that literally everybody uses."
2021-06-21 14:43:21,wallstreetbets,"I’ve known algorithms such that. Its unethical if not illegal. Another reason not to work for them, but not a reason to not invest."
2021-06-21 16:48:26,wallstreetbets,Kind of hate this already.  This screws with price trackers and searches.  Same with those $.01 items with shipping being the actual price of the item.
2021-06-21 19:51:46,wallstreetbets,"Thing is that people won't take long to figure out what's going on here. Grifting price in to shipping was being done in the early 00's on eBay and people knew what was happening. Now that's not to say it won't work, but if that's the algorithm, it's not much. I imagine this is going to improve, but if all Wish is doing is connecting a seller to a buyer, they don't have the pricing power that Amazon does - which can sell a competing product at a better price. In either case Amazon wins. If all Wish is doing is shifting numbers around, that's not a winning formula."
2021-06-21 13:49:26,wallstreetbets,The only thing longer than my position in WISH is my wife's boyfriend's two-tone dong.
2021-06-21 13:48:51,wallstreetbets,Wish upon those tendies!
2021-06-21 14:13:35,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-06-21 15:07:25,wallstreetbets,"Look at this huge DD

2021-06-21 14:15:06,wallstreetbets,🙏🏼 i hope you bathe in tendies on the moon.

2021-06-21 14:55:48,wallstreetbets,WISH to $69 🚀
2021-06-21 14:01:20,wallstreetbets,All depends on if it stalls out at 3 kabillion or keeps going up.
2021-06-21 17:13:54,wallstreetbets,"This actually sounds reasonable... what are you doing here? YOU DON'T BELONG!

ahum, joke of course. But yeah, if it was covid holding it back, then it would get back to its old level.
Though do know there has also been a big change in the european rules, which make importing cheap items more expensive as well. (Starting july 1st)
Before that ruling, wish kinda just sold everything or under 25, which meant no import needed to be paid."
2021-06-21 18:51:02,wallstreetbets,Hello. Am stupid. Can you explain your last sentence?
2021-06-21 14:00:42,wallstreetbets,"Literally every meme stock is actually the “real deal”

Every. Single. One."
2021-06-21 14:31:27,wallstreetbets,yeah the main reason everyone is bearish on this shit is because everything on the platform is a scam
2021-06-21 16:59:06,wallstreetbets,Yeah..  DHgate with better advertising.  Sketchy Chinese garbage.  But as it turns out...The world loves sketchy Chinese garbage.  They literally can't get enough of it.  lol
2021-06-21 16:31:34,wallstreetbets,"True. 

But they make buckets of cash."
2021-06-21 19:56:16,wallstreetbets,"It's literally the anti-Amazon. Amazon got big by selling out to customers' every whim and built enough loyalty that they could bully sellers. If Wish is competing on price alone, it's a race to the bottom - and no one wins that, especially when a ton of companies already have massive moats."
2021-06-21 15:10:54,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's fun novelty stuff. Some people see it as junk. Some people get a kick out of it. But 95% of their listings are NOT this.
2021-06-21 15:15:45,wallstreetbets,Or they hope you forget about it and never even send it (they deliver OUTSIDE of the return period so you have to constantly keep up on your order or it'll say delivered and lock you out of returns/rebuttal to scams)
2021-06-21 17:16:18,wallstreetbets,That’s cause it’s not a good service
2021-06-21 15:16:43,wallstreetbets,Just like buying stuff off Wish
2021-06-21 19:56:51,wallstreetbets,">seems like throwing money away

New here?"
2021-06-21 15:17:44,wallstreetbets,"I dont think anyone disagrees with the fact that it is trash, the whole play is about how much the trash is worth"
2021-06-21 19:09:10,wallstreetbets,It is its more a pump and dump if you ask me. Im willing to bet Wednesday after hours it gets dumped and folks are left holding a bag on Thursday.
2021-06-21 14:33:04,wallstreetbets,They just added 300k new vendors lol calm down
2021-06-21 15:00:08,wallstreetbets,1 word: I'm also very high
2021-06-21 17:16:44,wallstreetbets,“Pro” - OP probably has an Etsy page
2021-06-21 19:54:35,wallstreetbets,"I mean most of that panned out, at least in the short term . . . assuming you got in fast."
2021-06-21 15:43:12,wallstreetbets,That's what they say about your penis
2021-06-21 16:28:14,wallstreetbets,"Just like used car salesmen lol, sad shit"
2021-06-21 16:51:22,wallstreetbets,End cap items in stores are like this too. Increase a price on an item by 20% so the 20% off sale that starts a week later is more successful.
2021-06-21 17:13:42,wallstreetbets,Wish isn't Chinese.....
2021-06-21 16:49:04,wallstreetbets,Two-tone or 2 tone is a genre of British popular music of the late 1970s and early 1980s that fused traditional Jamaican ska music with elements of punk rock and new wave music.
2021-06-21 13:55:58,wallstreetbets,Lol!
2021-06-21 16:54:05,wallstreetbets,"That man's name? Tommy Tutone. Some say he get her number off a wall, for a good time call."
2021-06-21 19:07:24,wallstreetbets,"If you have 100 shares of something you can sell option contracts for it. 

You can also sell naked option contracts without the 100 shares but I wouldn’t recommend that."
2021-06-21 14:22:43,wallstreetbets,Look at the CLOV chart 🤣
2021-06-21 17:02:40,wallstreetbets,I mean forget Amazon AWS.  Wish takes money and sends nothing.  Helluva business model.  100% margins.  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
2021-06-21 16:11:32,wallstreetbets,"Its cheap clothes, cheap jewelry, cheap shit with a lot of it targeted at women. My wife chops at wish and doesn't care if 1 out of 5 things she buys is shit! She views it as the price was so cheap she is still saving money!"
2021-06-21 15:31:42,wallstreetbets,That does not change the issue
2021-06-21 15:02:30,wallstreetbets,"Fine, I'll get really high and recount and see what happens."
2021-06-21 17:03:43,wallstreetbets,True
2021-06-21 19:57:32,wallstreetbets,Which is why Wish would have been a great business model in the 80s.
2021-06-21 19:10:51,wallstreetbets,"I feel that way about TCL tv's they are super cheap and are great. My cousin asked once ""what if it breaks?"", I will just buy another 55"" for 250$."

2021-06-21 14:36:10,wallstreetbets,Based on the Trend the baseline low should continue to go up til the price starts to rise especially before the year end. Unless some interference happens forcing it to go down and I assume we gonna see some small time officials used as scapegoats for market manipulation crimes.

2021-06-21 13:40:46,wallstreetbets,"I think it's a good buy. But probably more long term.

2021-06-21 19:47:54,wallstreetbets,"Because UWMC gang can't stop begging for volume and people can smell the desperation. Turns people off and makes it seem like a PnD. 

It's sad that it has that reputation most of the bag holders have their entire portfolio's in this and have been diamond handsing since March. Also your discussion post is really badly written like a real ape.

That being said I have 1/4th my portfolio in this stock and won't sell until at least $20."

2021-06-21 18:17:50,wallstreetbets,Is the dividend reliable? TD Ameritrade doesn't count it towards my income estimator due to it's youth.
2021-06-21 14:37:20,wallstreetbets,"I think it's because nobody gives a shit about a mortgage company, not exactly the cutting edge of technology here. But it's profitable and making a ton of money. Just keep quietly loading up on shares if you believe it's undervalued."

2021-06-21 17:44:23,wallstreetbets,"Residential mortgage is not a good long term play. 

Rates are at historical lows, so there’s a lot of refi going on. When rates are back to normal - and they will go back to normal - refis will dive and big banks will then eat everyone’s lunch.

I’m a RKT holder, so you don’t have to tell me why that hypothesis is wrong."

2021-06-21 15:39:36,wallstreetbets,"Seems like you’re looking for a serious answer. Can’t say exactly what I do, but I followed my passions and make about 50k a year. Saved aggressively for years (40-60%) and index invested. Circumstances changed and withdrew my entire 401k/house down payment to go into a much more aggressive portfolio in late 2020. Full scholarship through Uni so I came out of school debt free and it set me up to where I am now. Late 20’s"
2021-06-21 16:57:55,wallstreetbets,"it's easy, just start with a small loan of $1mil from your parents"

2021-06-21 13:23:58,wallstreetbets,"Good time to buy shares? 
(In your opinion... I know you aren't a FA). 
Thanks."
2021-06-21 18:20:43,wallstreetbets,My confirmation bias is confirmed TY
2021-06-21 18:47:32,wallstreetbets,Fucking same. I'm scraping up and dumping shit across the board to load up on as much GME as possible. 💎🙌💎🍆🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-21 17:02:56,wallstreetbets,Holy shit you are going to be riiiiiiiiich.
2021-06-21 18:47:39,wallstreetbets,Fucking same. I'm scraping up and dumping shit across the board to load up on as much GME as possible. 💎🙌💎🍆🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-21 14:27:34,wallstreetbets,Why sell 0dte otm calls if you are so confident they will go up?
2021-06-21 14:29:10,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't them joining Russell 1000 force them out of 2000 and therefore actually causing a sell-off of shares. They are more weighted in the 2000 than they would be in the 1000?
2021-06-21 18:40:29,wallstreetbets,This did not age well.
2021-06-21 16:58:04,wallstreetbets,"Your selling naked calls?

I sold some puts, hoping I get assigned on them."
2021-06-21 16:51:09,wallstreetbets,"You should make a post, that’s an impressive position!"
2021-06-21 15:23:06,wallstreetbets,Still feel like it’s an asymmetric risk/reward that’s better than anything else I see in the market right now so I’ll keep loading until my thesis changes.
2021-06-21 13:40:40,wallstreetbets,The best kind of cheerleader
2021-06-21 18:08:03,wallstreetbets,Same.

2021-06-21 19:27:41,wallstreetbets,"I’ve spent more time doing/reading DD on this one play than I spent on my thesis. The February dip felt like it gave me stomach ulcers but the more data comes out, the clearer it becomes. The game isn’t over and all they did was delay buy-in but can’t stop it. Never been more sure of anything in my life. Shorts must cover."
2021-06-21 17:03:29,wallstreetbets,"Use broth to cook the noodles, add an egg, green onion and sprinkle some furikake on top. Makes it a lot more manageable if you’re really pressed on eating ramen for a prolonged period of time. Good luck!"
2021-06-21 19:10:16,wallstreetbets,And you still never bothered explaining.

2021-06-21 15:17:16,wallstreetbets,I was the option seller…
2021-06-21 17:47:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s a good point.
2021-06-21 16:51:03,wallstreetbets,thanks
2021-06-21 14:30:55,wallstreetbets,"That’s a start , but I was being more serious. 

I’m sure it was through hard work and education though"
2021-06-21 15:52:20,wallstreetbets,"Amazing man!!! I don’t even  know you and I’m proud of you. 

Playing with over $1mill in stocks and not even 30?!?!
I make around that and will have the ability to start saving much more when things get paid off. 
Hmm…so index funds huh? 

I wonder what I could turn 20k into if I played it right"
2021-06-21 17:05:49,wallstreetbets,Noice!

2021-06-21 15:27:58,wallstreetbets,The absolute best time
2021-06-21 18:21:38,wallstreetbets,I agree it went on a great sale today
2021-06-21 19:34:14,wallstreetbets,"$1M isn’t rich? Damn, what rock have I been under?"
2021-06-21 14:35:33,wallstreetbets,"Because it’s free money when you have a 100pt move necessary to go itm with the delta on otm quickly approaching 0 and itm going to 1, net negative pressure. Shares held to hedge the calls get sold. I won’t do it if any major FTD cycles are lined up with the Friday. On this many shares it’s several hundred to a few thousand per week with about $20 in contract fees."
2021-06-21 14:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but if you borrow and sell an etf that tracks and the etf removes the underlying from holdings. Are those that are borrowed required to close? Genuinely not sure here. 

Another point is holding in Russell 1000 gives more legitimacy to the turnaround of the company. I truly believe they are in a strong position to take market share and expand operations in e-commerce. Some funds may also have requirements in what they can invest in, having a higher qualification is nothing but beneficial Imo."
2021-06-21 17:04:18,wallstreetbets,"I have the shares and don’t sell contracts that exceed what I own, they’re covered calls."
2021-06-21 17:06:26,wallstreetbets,Ok ill do it now
2021-06-21 19:28:29,wallstreetbets,Good luck my friend. I hope you make millions more. 👍🏼
2021-06-21 19:41:49,wallstreetbets,Add sriracha if you tryna talk rich

2021-06-21 14:38:45,wallstreetbets,Buy GME and you will answer your question
2021-06-21 15:05:10,wallstreetbets,After being here long enough I learned that none of that is true. Maybe for the .001%.
2021-06-21 15:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Index investing isn’t where most of this came from at all. It was when I started messing with options, margin and spac warrants that my account blew up (many do this and blow up in the not good way…). Good luck to you though! It was about 135k when I withdrew it all."
2021-06-21 17:26:44,wallstreetbets,Fuck yess
2021-06-21 14:51:15,wallstreetbets,"Theres no question it gives legitimacy however the fact remains it'll be a massive selling position, in the Russell 1000 they will be a needle in a haystack. The whole shorting an ETF to short one small component of it is a huge stretch, even if they are required GME is unloading 5 million shares that's like half the short positions."
2021-06-21 15:52:54,wallstreetbets,I missed the boat
2021-06-21 14:39:56,wallstreetbets,I have some
2021-06-21 15:44:26,wallstreetbets,Could you read my sarcasm?? Nice
2021-06-21 16:05:02,wallstreetbets,"So with conversion I should be able to hit about 150k 😆 

Yeah Mann, I get it. Smart moves. Tesla has been good to me. Hoping TLRY breaks out within the next two years. 

I need to learn about selling covered calls in fidelity and picking the right strike prices to maximize profit but not lose the shares through people exercising. 
 But if I do it right I could buy the shares right back and keep rolling."
2021-06-21 17:32:47,wallstreetbets,You jacked?
2021-06-21 15:01:32,wallstreetbets,"I don’t believe it’ll be more than a drop in the bucket to how exposed they are. We wouldn’t see cyclical runs if they did close all their positions. If the forced selling does cause a dip, I’m still going to continue loading in. I can’t say with certainty what the change will force in terms of short term movement. I’ve already held for 6 months and have no problem holding for much longer."
2021-06-21 16:07:15,wallstreetbets,She's got a LOOOOONG way to go.
2021-06-21 19:02:59,wallstreetbets,I'm averaging up lol

2021-06-21 17:33:44,wallstreetbets,You will see me jacking off on the other side of the moon come Friday 😂hell yes
2021-06-21 15:19:05,wallstreetbets,What I'm saying is that the inclusion will force a short-term selling pressure lowering share price but also stabilize the stock from extreme downward selling pressure like we saw in Feb.
2021-06-21 17:31:15,wallstreetbets,I'm putting more into GME now than I was at the beginning...
2021-06-21 16:10:33,wallstreetbets,The fact that they sold so many more shares than exist is mind boggling. It’s literally a no brainer to hold until they must pay.
2021-06-21 19:36:45,wallstreetbets,why long?
2021-06-21 17:06:57,wallstreetbets,I have a few tickets
2021-06-21 18:28:40,wallstreetbets,"Gme weighting in r1000 would be a lot more than you think, they're not on the bottom of the list.

Also I'm actually banking on an attack down to 180 to buy more, give me dips, thank you, I'm a long term investor and see the long term possibilities are endless. Crazy to think otherwise."
2021-06-21 18:03:53,wallstreetbets,"Ignore this guy op, sweet yolo! And he been on gme meltdown prolly paperhanded some serious losses 🏳️‍🌈🧸"

2021-06-21 13:22:19,wallstreetbets,I’m holding CLOV until I profit I’m stubborn asf
2021-06-21 13:11:24,wallstreetbets,"Plus with the new SEC filing, CLOV issued a risk warning for possible short squeeze."
2021-06-21 13:37:53,wallstreetbets,"Made some money on CLOV and bought back in, I fully expect this stock to go to $30+."
2021-06-21 18:16:10,wallstreetbets,So many people who are in on AMC keep bashing CLOV. CLOV is a good company with a lot of future potential squeeze or no squeezed
2021-06-21 13:30:47,wallstreetbets,I’d like to see a bear and bull analysis all in one.
2021-06-21 14:09:26,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why there’s so much hate. I’m not personally in CLOV at the moment but it’s been on my radar for awhile, may buy in soon at this dip. Best of luck to you!"
2021-06-21 18:32:26,wallstreetbets,"I got in CLOV around 7 bucks , so I’ve been in for awhile.. definitely not a bag holder so my thoughts are a little different then guys that got in at the 28 mark. If people did their own DD on CLOV and stopped listening to FUDsters then maybe they would open their eyes to the possibility in front of us.. a squeeze you can take profit from when it pops and then hold a position for the strength it will give you long term.. 🤷🏽‍♂️but I’m just an old conveyor mechanic so what do I know 🤠"
2021-06-21 13:34:19,wallstreetbets,By CLOV all in. Lets play!

2021-06-21 15:40:29,wallstreetbets,SEC filing warning of the short squeeze made me wet. I think clover does a reversal in the coming weeks
2021-06-21 16:29:26,wallstreetbets,CLOV is a good investment imo with or without the squeeze.
2021-06-21 14:22:48,wallstreetbets,Averaged down and got enough shares so I'll eventually be able to comfortably sell covered calls.

2021-06-21 12:58:21,wallstreetbets,Shill much?
2021-06-21 16:36:23,wallstreetbets,I did and done paid the price of it. I am burned by these distraction stocks one to many times recently. This is the hedges game. To raid our pockets thru trickery so they can stay afloat after GME blasts off. This is why they prolong it. Its all about getting money to pay for this shit and staying alove. I'll pass and stick to whats working. GME and AMC
2021-06-21 16:43:55,wallstreetbets,This seems super desperate

2021-06-21 13:20:09,wallstreetbets,How can you WSB apes ignore this. GME did the exact same thing. Don't miss the boat on this one

2021-06-21 18:01:26,wallstreetbets,Not percentage-wise.  Their stake in clov is twice as deep as amc.
2021-06-21 13:32:01,wallstreetbets,So you lost your yearly salary which is what I said you lost your balls
2021-06-21 13:30:04,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-06-21 16:40:44,wallstreetbets,Although I'm holding clov this is a standard liability add on that most of these companies have to put it to cover their ass. They did the same thing with Nokia after the large volume spike and the short squeeze never came. Don't get me wrong I would very much like to see it. I unfortunatly didn't sell for whatever reason and now am in the negative from my profit margins again lol. Hope I wrong though I would very much like to make some tendies from this stock it does have a solid potential in my ape opinion but who the hell know with the mods removing every post related to clov
2021-06-21 15:01:12,wallstreetbets,True Ape
2021-06-21 19:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Its pathetic really, what do they think theyll achieve, CLOV has all the ingredients to go big, its like they lack self esteem or something"
2021-06-21 13:57:57,wallstreetbets,I just wanted to share some information if anyone is interested and yes I'm a bot so be it )
2021-06-21 13:30:01,wallstreetbets,"""Everything not AMC is a distraction and a BOT. "" said by an idiot

you guys will probably do yourselves in before Blackrock and Vanguard decide to pull the rug under you. Oh and Adam Aron"
2021-06-21 13:10:48,wallstreetbets,Look at his post history. I own zero shares of GME or AMC. Apparently he's not a bot but he's acting like one.
2021-06-21 13:35:46,wallstreetbets,"This is a promising company I invested in long - term , I will wait , it will succeed !"
2021-06-21 17:02:20,wallstreetbets,NOK didn't squeeze only because RH and others restricted trading on the stock. NOK would've printed otherwise
2021-06-21 19:53:40,wallstreetbets,"They just cant leave the CLOV DD/TA alone . I mean if they are winning , why they wasting their time doing this? Hence, why they probably tip top bagholders"
2021-06-21 13:16:57,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a bot , honestly"
2021-06-21 16:27:16,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
2021-06-21 17:07:24,wallstreetbets,"You are actually correct in a way. But if you compare GME and AMC BB or most mentioned stocks they all bounced back nok has a been stagnant ever since. I lost a good bit on that shit show but made it back through GME then AMC plays over the past few week. Hit an absolute home run with clov but didn't really see this massive dip coming to be honest. All the resistance around 16 bucks a share last week put me in the red this week currently holding 170 @ 14.95 I did reduce my position today and bought some wish shares to make a few bucks to reinvest into something while the market continues to dip to cover my losses. 

But my point really was that the clause on page 44 is just standard business liability clause so you can't sue them as a bag holder."

2021-06-21 12:53:29,wallstreetbets,Haven't seen a Roku yolo in a while. Nice job ape. I love me some wish calls. Bought $600 worth this morning when it was at 11.72. Not selling till at least $17+. 🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍

2021-06-21 13:01:56,wallstreetbets,I bought a $17 call for Friday. It has the potential! Hoping for $14.30 by EOD.
2021-06-21 16:01:01,wallstreetbets,I'll never forgive myself for listening to WSB when it first IPO'ed with everyone calling it a shit stock. Probably would sold when it hit the 100s though.
2021-06-21 13:02:36,wallstreetbets,But… those are positions…
2021-06-21 13:28:27,wallstreetbets,"Not breaking $14 hurt the momentum, looking like a sideways $13.40 for a bit before the next boom. I'm also hoping by Friday it'll be $17, good luck!"
2021-06-21 13:31:32,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-06-21 13:29:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah I know. I still think by Friday we will be golden. Good luck to you as well!
2021-06-21 14:21:16,wallstreetbets,Exactly what I was thinking. Healthy consolidation at $13-$14 range until the next leg up.
2021-06-21 14:48:24,wallstreetbets,We are going to do it! $14 is coming
2021-06-21 15:39:38,wallstreetbets,"Looked like it, then a 25c sudden drop?? Some big paper bagger exercised their calls and didn't rebuy maybe."

2021-06-21 12:20:39,wallstreetbets,Wish is the real deal with it being the dollar store of the world and mostly in developing countries. Also it’s app is like the most downloaded right next to amazon. If apes can trigger GME and AMC to the moon this is going to Uranus.
2021-06-21 13:11:37,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the drawings and magic crayons and confirmation bias.

&#x200B;

While I am in the stock, I gotta give you some feedback. You're video didnt really provide anything beyond, ""hopefully we end here, if do sky come"" for someone that doesnt really know TA. Not sure if thats all you meant to provide, but if you meant to explain the ""whys"" and such beyond saying inverse shampoo, it wasnt really good.

In all, not bashing, just providing some blunt feedback =p. Wish to the moooooon"

2021-06-21 12:52:36,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is it's a good idea to pick up some shares of this company that's currently being traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

2021-06-21 16:02:28,wallstreetbets,TA is always right except when it isn’t.
2021-06-21 17:51:25,wallstreetbets,"Nice TA.

It's a clean pattern, my one quibble is that I think it may need to punch into the 16s, maybe break 17, to really confirm inverse head & shoulders, but otherwise looks good.

If you look at the fundamentals, fair value for the stock is 15-17$ imro, so this one could be juicy, fingers crossed (700 shares at $13.46)"
2021-06-21 13:58:07,wallstreetbets,Let's go! 🚀
2021-06-21 15:14:13,wallstreetbets,The real question is if you’ll be smart enough to sell before the hedge fund pumping this stock does
2021-06-21 14:02:16,wallstreetbets,Pumped and ready for the dump...set that stop loss and stop listening to people that want you to keep buying a stock that is overvalued.  There is a reason it has been losing for months - CYA

2021-06-21 18:33:24,wallstreetbets,Not to be that person but the right graph resistance lines are drawn incorrectly. It should be on top of both those new highs & slightly below that consolidation on its current leg

2021-06-21 12:23:59,wallstreetbets,To be honest I dont care what kind of stock it is ... unless its into deforestation of Apes.  I see a nice chart; it looks pretty - its been mentioned on WSB - I want in.  Uranus sounds good ... past the moon then we go!
2021-06-21 12:34:55,wallstreetbets,My anus?
2021-06-21 13:53:05,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the feedback! - TA is a game of percentages if it goes here it will 'most likely' go here ... until proven otherwise.
2021-06-21 13:52:33,wallstreetbets,By end of week or when?
2021-06-21 17:37:25,wallstreetbets,Does it need to break that “neck line” to be a sustainable breakout and complete the inverse h/s?
2021-06-21 17:03:39,wallstreetbets,"This confuses me as I’m new. I bought 13 calls for 7/2 and immediately lost 22 dollars, even though stock price went up. If stock increases shouldn’t call option price as well?"

2021-06-21 14:09:28,wallstreetbets,"Thats the thing with trendlines - they are All subjective, I find as price advances I change them a bit to match up and they work out better even."
2021-06-21 18:06:51,wallstreetbets,"I Agree, a break of the neckline (15) with volume is needed to conform a inv. H&S, I always tend to pre-empt chart patterns... Sometimes I get in early  and other times I get stopped out (because the pattern forms later or is something different).

I think we got the benefit of the downward wedge/channel being broken in our favor. 

If we hit 15 in the next few days that'll be a good sign."

2021-06-21 18:28:24,wallstreetbets,By tomorrow morning. 25 end of week.
2021-06-21 16:27:42,wallstreetbets,Gonna have to wait and see
2021-06-21 18:11:19,wallstreetbets,"Ya, break 15 with volume preferred. But I've seen good chart patterns break with average volume and still complete.  I just tend to pre-empt patterns and try to get in early, ie as the right (2nd shoulder appears to form) - technically you are supposed to wait for a break of the neckline to get in or a retest after that... But seeing how these other wsb stocks pop... You going to wait for a retest?"
2021-06-21 18:13:27,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you've been hit by--

You've been struck by--

Theta decay.

Theta decay is stronger as the contract approaches expiry--if you weren't poor, you could have gone for contracts expiring later, which have a lower rate of Theta decay right now, but a higher premium (no free lunch and all that)."
2021-06-21 15:31:32,wallstreetbets,"It's about as reliable as tea leaves, and relies just as much on retroactive justification."
2021-06-21 18:32:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah After hours but $14.22 already. Let’s hope it ends on a good week!
2021-06-21 18:27:08,wallstreetbets,"Oh I actually bought monthly calls last Thursday, was just wondering cause I don’t know a ton about TA. Thanks for the response!"
2021-06-21 18:38:43,wallstreetbets,"Annie, are you okay?"
2021-06-21 18:57:25,wallstreetbets,"Haha. It was only for 40 bucks different for a longer expiry. Guess I should’ve done that, like I said I don’t exactly understand options, just fomoing it. I’ll buy the longer expiry calls and average up like a true ape."
2021-06-21 18:59:17,wallstreetbets,That's the spirit--no better way to learn than risking losing a crap-ton of money.
2021-06-21 18:59:36,wallstreetbets,"That was my strategy

Edit…

IS my strategy."

2021-06-21 15:35:33,wallstreetbets,GSAT is hitting the Russell 3000 this week! Officially June 25th. So this might be a wild week.
2021-06-21 12:32:45,wallstreetbets,I just want that 20% gainer
2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Airlines, cruise lines and travel I've said this throughout the year and ill continue to say but I think for a good play, one should consider airlines, cruise lines and travel. They will be the main beneficiaries of reponening. I've read some responses that say they've been priced. I disagree. If you look at spending trends, you'll notice that younger generations spend more on experiences over things. Also with the largest generation retiring at an unprecedented rate, the momentum of travel and vacation will only increase. It's one of the sectors that do well with price increases because fixed expenses don't increase. They hedge against gas, the debt they incurred was so cheap. Also to say we won't move past Covid is silly. Sure, headlines here and there but the most vulnerable are protected. We will come back to travel. As far as business travel....it won't come back....right. The second someone travels to a client and wins some business everyone else will follow suit. This isn't advice and I'm dumb."

2021-06-21 12:16:05,wallstreetbets,"AAL, UAL, CCL"
2021-06-21 13:11:03,wallstreetbets,I bought more CCL and NCLH today. I agree. I don't need them to go to the moon. I'll take 25 to 33% up by year's end.
2021-06-21 12:05:12,wallstreetbets,"Okay guys, hear me out.  I think a good play right now would be the automobile.  Why would anyone ride a horse when you can get somewhere twice as fast in a horseless carriage?"
2021-06-21 11:56:43,wallstreetbets,Where have you been the last year?
2021-06-21 13:17:29,wallstreetbets,"I travel (fly) frequently for work.  Been through 10+ different airports, some of them multiple times, so far this year.  They are all packed.

I've seen and talked to all different kinds of people in them too.  Seems to be a fairly even mix of business travelers, families going on vacations, and people traveling to see family/couples (no kids) traveling for leisure.  I'm not going to turn this comment into a plug for the airline I travel with/decided to buy stock in...but I will say that particular stock, and the other airline stocks I've been watching over the course of the year, are all fairly close to the pre-covid SP.  The kicker is....all of their dividends are suspended atm.  And who knows if they will go back to paying them or not?

I'd be interested to hear others' thoughts on the benefits of starting a position now.  But for me, it was a decision I made with a VERY long timeline, with the personal belief that the airline will be around (and successful) on that same timeline.  If the dividends come back, that would be a welcome bonus."
2021-06-21 12:52:00,wallstreetbets,"Flight Attendant here. 

Let's say the stock was at an ATH of like $60 pre-pandemic and now it's $50. I would NOT expect it to go much above $60. This is not financial advice, and I do think it will go up if it's undervalued, however at the end of the day corporations have 'value' and those shares trade at a value based on the fundamentals. The exception being meme stocks. So do your DD and research and look at what the stock was before. I am not a financial advisor, just someone who loves flying."
2021-06-21 13:33:42,wallstreetbets,ULCC (Frontier Airlines) just went public a couple of moths ago and still low with a lot of growth potential
2021-06-21 13:38:33,wallstreetbets,I bought spirit airlines at the March lows @$8  and loaded up on MESA airlines in October at $3.  I’m hoping for a big payday come 3rd quarter earnings
2021-06-21 11:57:29,wallstreetbets,"Too busy buying $WISH kinda , but what are your thoughts on $PK (hotel reit)"
2021-06-21 12:37:47,wallstreetbets,All these tickets are up 50% already. Way too late imo
2021-06-21 12:48:34,wallstreetbets,You’re joking right?
2021-06-21 11:57:08,wallstreetbets,Travel: yes. But I believe cruise lines are dead or dying.
2021-06-21 11:58:06,wallstreetbets,No.
2021-06-21 13:34:33,wallstreetbets,"I'm doubling down on my airline and CEUs lien plays.  I've been I  2023 calls because I can't say when, but I know for sure they are going to rebound.  Nicely."
2021-06-21 14:19:14,wallstreetbets,"There is a lot of airlines, or hotels but you know how straus got rich in california’s gold rush? He sold pants & showels. 
Airbnb and booking are the real winners here."
2021-06-21 14:33:04,wallstreetbets,Just posted a picture of putting my money where my mouth is
2021-06-21 15:17:25,wallstreetbets,I guess SPY only go up is more accurate than stonks only go up
2021-06-21 13:34:00,wallstreetbets,"I would say it's way too late to buy into these. If you bought in last January you would have made a lot of money. Don't expect to make much more, these stocks have already taken off."
2021-06-21 14:12:22,wallstreetbets,"Why would you pick the worst of each industry? DAL, ALK, LUV, and RCL are all better picks."
2021-06-21 13:15:57,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. These will move further without question. I mean, have you heard of Americans?! Our people are dying to get on a ship or a plane and forget about last year"
2021-06-21 13:19:22,wallstreetbets,"Way ahead of you brother. I think the next baller play is these E commerce business. Probably haven't heard of this Amazon company yet, but get in. OP doesn't know what he's talking about."
2021-06-21 12:27:43,wallstreetbets,Vegas twice and Florida once
2021-06-21 12:20:02,wallstreetbets,"went to Denver, stayed there then went to Boulder for a week, traveled down to Phoenix, AZ then went up to Sedona, then up even further to the Grand Canyon."
2021-06-21 15:53:37,wallstreetbets," Charlotte is American Airlines hub on east coast, last 3 flights I connected through there I got an email to show up 3 hours early to get through security.  Glad I was only connecting and it was packed each time.  Travel is up!"
2021-06-21 14:27:33,wallstreetbets,"So, they'll cap at 60 and never grow? Do you DD....."
2021-06-21 12:26:04,wallstreetbets,"Some cruise lines, for example Carnival, have been managed fairly well through the pandemic, selling new shares to raise cash and if you look at the fundamentals aren't actually in danger of going bankrupt at the moment. They have plenty of cash runaway.

Also the demand for cruises is absolutely huge. The customer base for companies like Carnival are desperate to get back on a cruise a ASAP and aren't being put off by Covid at all. I believe they sell out of tickets almost immediately when they go on sale for cruises later this year and next year.

I agree with you that cruises are bad for the environment but that doesn't stop people from going on them. I can't think of anything worse than going on a cruise myself, but there are many people out they don't feel the same way I will happily spend the cash on a cruise, even now with the threat of Covid"
2021-06-21 12:05:03,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. Not only for retirees it is the easiest method to travel, it is also the most convenient way to travel for people with small kids. As somebody with small kids can assure you."
2021-06-21 11:57:53,wallstreetbets,Totally agree there debt is crazy!
2021-06-21 14:23:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no. So I have around 500k on abnb and I like them. I don't like spac’s. That's what happened to that stock. It got destroyed when rounds of investors were released from hold requirements. Long term, they are a buy for sure"
2021-06-21 14:30:21,wallstreetbets,Your DD sounds solid!
2021-06-21 12:37:01,wallstreetbets,I meant buy these stocks when they were beat down
2021-06-21 12:37:45,wallstreetbets,I meant buying thaws stocks when they were beat down... love the mountains in Arizona and the grand canyon
2021-06-21 15:47:09,wallstreetbets,Of course they will grow. They will grow with the market. Steady gains.
2021-06-21 12:30:52,wallstreetbets,"You make a fair point. I had assumed sentiment towards cruises in general had changed (having never gone on one, myself). I did read about some financial troubles with at least one major cruise line. I suppose only time will tell what will actually happen to the industry."
2021-06-21 12:44:12,wallstreetbets,"Me too! I did not ""enjoy"" either of the 2 cruises I have taken. 2 day just for an introduction, then a 4 day. Just, not for me. Seems like gorging on food is top priority and that's not me. And I don't like the cattle factor: Herd ya here, herd ya there."
2021-06-21 12:09:52,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but it's terrible for the environment and also a giant, floating petri dish."
2021-06-21 11:59:48,wallstreetbets,"Yup. And people are probably a bit more skittish about cramping in together in a confined space, even one as large as a cruise ship. Consider the virus breakouts on those cruise ships last year that couldn't dock anywhere."
2021-06-21 16:04:49,wallstreetbets,"Oh sorry, I’m autistic and comprehended it wrong"
2021-06-21 12:38:10,wallstreetbets,"Don't get me wrong the cruise industry is going to take years to recover, and its a long term play in terms of investment, but I personally don't think it will go bankrupt if cruises do go ahead this year/early next year. If there was a new wave of covid that forced the industry to shut down for a further 12+ months then we could see the industry die unless it was bailed out."
2021-06-21 16:10:55,wallstreetbets,Win any money in Vegas?
2021-06-21 16:33:50,wallstreetbets,"What does winning money mean?  I do all right for myself when I play blackjack and punto banco, but my vice of playing $100 high roller slot spins is my downfall.  There is a reason why you get comps for slot play and not BJ and PB."

2021-06-21 17:09:23,wallstreetbets,Lol y’all are baffling to me. Part of me is convinced this sub is ONLY filled with hedge fund bots and employees at this point. This is a horrible play. Just because something has BARELY high short interest doesn’t mean it’s a play. Cant believe I have to say this. Hopefully the real apes and wsb guys realize this. GME and AMC are the only short squeeze plays. All this sub is anymore is a pump n dump playground
2021-06-21 15:25:01,wallstreetbets,You realize this is something to be embarrassed about right?
2021-06-21 18:47:41,wallstreetbets,I like that portfolio diversity you fucking retard

2021-06-21 18:38:00,wallstreetbets,"Started saving as much as I could, starting around 1998-'99 or so.  Have always lived cheaply, mostly in rented rooms.  No girlfriend, no dog, no cat.  Moved to where the work is, whenever necessary.  It wasn't an enjoyable life, but survival came first.  

Went back to school in my thirties, spent most of my savings getting through that gauntlet, made it out the other side as a family doctor, and earnings are up a fair bit compared to before.  Still lived pretty much the same way as before, though.

I'm up to a million in savings now, about 10% of it from GME, a bit from AMD, but most of it from Boomer stocks.  Survival has long ceased to be a problem, but my thrifty habits are hard to change.

I'm not a miser, I don't have any particular love of money.  Just nothing good in my life to spend any of it on."
2021-06-21 18:09:06,wallstreetbets,That sounds right. It's been said that the fastest way to make a small fortune is to start with a big one.

Putting in a couple hundred that I saved, making a little profit next day or same week trading and recycle. I've only made a couple hundred so far from my initial investment. But I'm definitely not to the point of just straight YOLO'ing on a stock yet. Props to those who do. Scared money don't make money!"
2021-06-21 14:18:30,wallstreetbets,Start saving when one is young and it's not that difficult actually.  I started putting money into the S&P at 12 years old(I'm 40 now) and I went over a million saved 5 years ago.  One should be putting away 10-15% of takehome always.

2021-06-21 18:21:51,wallstreetbets,"Lmao WSB is full of a bunch of poor bitter losers now. Try working hard and taking risks, or even easier doing jobs that other people don't want to do. 

Nothing is stopping any of you whiners from going and working on rigs or pipe lining, becoming welders, working in mines or starting landscaping companies

People don't want to do hard dangerous jobs then feel sorry for themselves and are bitter towards people that do without having a clue what goes into it.

FWIW I'm a commercial crab fisherman and make 200k+ a year, you want to do the same, nut up, head to the coast and walk the dock we are literally begging for people to work because everyone is so lazy and scared of hard dangerous work now. Just be prepared to work 30+ hours straight shifts in bad conditions with little to no rest in between and get screamed at the entire time.

2021-06-21 17:34:45,wallstreetbets,"I congrats 👏 you for working hard.  I never meant life was easy or what not but saving some money is. Now the amount differs for everyone.  That's why I said if it's 50 a month it's 50.  It takes sacrifice 100% and I do it daily still today.  Will I stop and spend at some point, yes I will bc I can't take it with me.  But until that day I'm a frugal SOB and that's who I am. I still shop at the 2nd hand store for my clothes. Do I need to, nope but I pay 10 cents for a tee shirt there, not the 15-20 or more that people do."
2021-06-21 17:07:50,wallstreetbets,Well did you start at 25 than?

2021-06-21 18:23:24,wallstreetbets,"This big time. I’m a mortgage broker (there is a TON of money to make in real estate) and I work extremely closely with a few insurance brokers as insurance is a big part of the mortgage process, and it all depends on how hard you go. A buddy started his company from 0 about 5 or 6 years ago and he’s making $50k plus a month as an immigrant with broken English and others I work with struggle to break even. 

The big thing you gotta realize in insurance is the money you make on yearly renewals. Once you get the pipeline going, every renewal is basically a yearly 0 effort check."

2021-06-21 16:25:12,wallstreetbets,There’s no point giving good advice here it’s not r/investing they want to hear how one share of GME will make them billionaires or some other pump and dump scheme. Good on you though that advice helps me.
2021-06-21 18:28:17,wallstreetbets,Man I agree with you about most things you've said but that sounds miserable as fuck. As with most things I think the answer lies somewhere in the middle. I'm probably in the top .7% of income or something and 50th percentile of net worth because I like to go on 50k worldwide 5* gambling tours and buy 25k of weeklies several times a year so not saying my way is right but being so concerned with saving sounds miserable.
2021-06-21 18:20:24,wallstreetbets,How the fuck are you supposed to give an answer to these people who don’t even have spare money to invest apparently though? Find a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow?

2021-06-21 19:01:13,wallstreetbets,"Fuck out of here. I haven’t met a single person that whines about how little money they have that isn’t simultaneously living beyond their means.

Every. single. one.

You’re all living the life you think you deserve, not the one you can afford. I see it all around me. It’s the American way now. Consumers."
2021-06-21 17:41:36,wallstreetbets,Damn sounds like you have victim bias if he has survivorship bias
2021-06-21 19:07:08,wallstreetbets,"Most people do spend money on things that they don't need though.  If you are living paycheck to paycheck... do you have a TV?  Do you travel?  Do you eat out?  Do you drink alcohol?  Do you have a  phone that's newer than 3 years old?  A tablet?  A laptop that you don't use for work?  Fancy (expensive) headphones or ear buds? Brand name clothes? These are all luxuries.  Maybe you want them but no one needs them.  So you have a choice between spending money on that stuff, or  saving that money.  If you can afford it it's fine, but if you are living paycheck to paycheck and you have that stuff then you are choosing to live paycheck to paycheck.  You could just as easily choose not to have that stuff and put some money away.

In my experience people with less money make terrible financial decisions.  If you have ever ""saved up"" to buy something (or, worse, bought it on credit) you are doing it wrong.  These are ways that people buy things that they can't afford, and the reason that they continue to have no money.  If you manage to save up some money, your response should not be to spend it right away on a big ticket item.  Put the money away.  Do that enough times and suddenly you are not poor any more."
2021-06-21 16:51:25,wallstreetbets,Well not sure where you see I didn't invest in Real Estate bc I definitely did and still do.  I myself just live well within my means still to this day. RE is 100% the best investment one can make.  There is only 1 thing in this world that you can't get more of and that's land.
2021-06-21 16:04:10,wallstreetbets,"Rent is necessary 100%.... Now my question is, is the place your renting necessary?  I lived in a basement tiny ass 1 bedroom(if one can call it that) old ass apartment. Even after I could afford the nicer place I lived there bc I wanted to save money.  I just sat down with a friend last week and he realized(I hope) he dosen't need to live in his apartment he has(1400 plus utilities) a month. He was saying he was struggling keeping up.  Well he can live in a apartment for 750 that is pretty nice where everything is covered.  So that's 900 dollars a month right there he could save.  So yes, life hacks are there bud."

2021-06-21 18:36:27,wallstreetbets,"Na, I have fun but I didn't grow up rich by any means. I was taught young to save and it stuck I guess.  I'm watching a baseball game outside right now so life is good.  Cost- Free local legion ball."
2021-06-21 17:12:50,wallstreetbets,Well start tomorrow or next paycheck and do what you can. It will take some sacrifice (not eating out or buying that energy drink etc) but you can do it.  It will add up over time and I suggest safe investments like the S&P etc to start building.  Good luck I hope to see you on top of the mountain!

2021-06-21 18:59:58,wallstreetbets,"Nah mostly living expenses. Bad choice of words on my part.

The licensing itself isn’t super expensive and I assume there is little to no cost for the insurance agent to write insurance policies since they sell them directly from larger insurance agencies. The costs come from the marketing needed to build the pipeline and whatnot"

Or are you somehow arguing that this guy is wrong and bad because he can save and some can’t? I’m confused by your angle."
2021-06-21 15:19:21,wallstreetbets,"I feel like the point is to just try to save any percent possible, most employers have some benefits to match. Even 1% of a paycheck is better than nothing and will add up over time."
2021-06-21 15:18:38,wallstreetbets,"Ya, and in 99% of cases that's on them. People need to live within their means. Yes it plain sucks unfortunately for a lot of people. It's hard to watch other living the high life when you are not.  My first job I made 6.25 an hour.  I saved 10% that I put away.  I lived in a basement for years even when I could afford nicer places bc I saved and didn't need to have the super nice place. I get people struggle and it sucks. I did also, I made choices though to take that away in the future.  It can be done but again it takes sacrifice and will.  To this day I don't buy things I could afford but don't need.  I have a 11 year old vehicle, I could go buy a brand new 80k truck if I wanted with cash. Guess what I choose not to and live within my comfortable means.  I sit down with people weekly and help them develop a saving plan. I get one needs things to take off the pressure of life but you also need to plan for your future.  So if that means cutting back on that case of beer or what not it can be done in 99% of cases."

My S.O. acts like we are broke all the time but she feels its her right to go out to eat once a week if not more. (She's saying like once a week to a nice place, while we actually get food out 3-6 times a week.) People want to bitch about not saving money, and I've been where I cant afford even a dollar in savings for years. But staying in that position is no ones fault but their own. I have serious charges on my record, in recovery currently, and I hustled my ass off for years to get where I am. When I was making thousands a week doing D2D I was still poor because I couldn't understand saving, and didnt grasp how quickly things add up. I make way less now, and I have a substantial savings.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I'm switching to OSK and why absolutely nobody cares As I already stated, nobody cares, so it's not really intended for you to keep reading but you are so I'll keep typing. I spent all of the past week trying to convince myself that WKHS was the next big dick ape play, but realized that it is far from it. WKHS's lawsuit towards USPS overshadowed a lawsuit filed against them by investors because they kept saying they were guaranteed a contract when they never even submitted one of the required documents. OSK was down $16 from this year's high in a week, most of which happened on the day the lawsuit was announced. Except WKHS isn't going to win that lawsuit because their only argument is that they weren't considered strong enough and this has been the case with about the past dozen or so of their contracts. OSK on the other hand was chosen for the contract, grows by an exponential revenue annually that has broken estimates every single time, has a great P/E, P/S, P/B, and PEG ratio compared to the surrounding industry and recently just took a superficial dip that would be beyond easy to cash in on by purchasing calls. I made ten 130 calls @ .65 yesterday for Jul 16 and they are already up 30% today and so I'm tripling down and also throwing in some 140 calls. Listen to me, don't listen to me, call me a shill, but I only started to profit when I stopped listening to the PnD scams, got off the S.S. smooth brain, and realized just how much WSB has fallen since I started being a member 5 years ago (yes this is a new account because I took a three year break and forgot my old account info)

Edit: Forgot to say why nobody cares. WKHS has tricked a whole bunch of investors into thinking they are great and have done such an amazing job of it that these people are now advocating trusting a company that has been hemorrhaging money for the past 2 years should have been chosen over an award winning, quickly growing, and massively successful company. I don't know if it's buyer's remorse or the continued hope in the little guy but sometimes it's just plain wrong."

2021-06-21 12:11:34,wallstreetbets,WKHS SI is insanely high and the amount of float shorted is boiling over combined with only 12 mill +  shares it could be epic.  Not looking long term but it take off if support builds.

Stop lying thru ur teeth 🥱. Everyone sees thru it 🥱. Ur so concerned about people losing money on wkhs? Put ur money where ur fucking mouth is - buy puts or short it - and then u can make a post that isn’t hot fucking garbage.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"[$GOLD] The greatest Gamma Squeeze? Barrick Gold \[$GOLD\] is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the upcoming ""gold rush""

Paper gold and derivatives outsize the actual gold held by a magnitude of 200x-250x (Paper gold include gold certificates, exchange traded funds, gold futures, options, and contracts)

* This created a systemic fiscal global risk that could destabilize the world economies
* The Countermeasure
* Europe will implement Basel III regulations by June 28th, 2021 and by July 1st in the USA.
   * From this point on, gold must be physical and held by institutions in their own vaults/and or funding to the tune of 85% coverage of the unallocated gold.
   * The Net Stable Funding Ratio requirement will make it difficult for banks and other institutions to keep unallocated gold. Forcing them to buy and allocate gold.
* The moment of reckoning
   * It will make central banks and other investors raise their gold reserves, by 200-250x or be forced out of the market.
      * Reality is that the European and UK banks are under tremendous pressure and remains ill prepared
      * Bullion banks will likely withdraw from the paper gold markets
* The status of banks preparing for this pivotal moment
* Central banks have begun their gold buying campaign starting in 2018 when it was made clear of the Basel III intentions to implement, with 95t of gold in Q1 of 2021 alone.
* They are competing with retail consumer demand: A third successive quarter of growth in bar and coin investment saw it reach 339.5t - the highest since Q4 2016. The Q1 total was 36% higher y-o-y and 37% above the five-year quarterly average of 248.5t.
* **The Long Thesis:**
   * **Post Basel III implementation, the market supply of gold will drop by 75%, causing a dramatic shortage of gold caused by the need to support the paper gold (85% ratio). This may trigger a run on gold to above $2000/oz**
   * **At an all in cost of production, Barrick Gold is at about $900/oz and could see significant margin improvements, and is best positioned to supply the world's demand shortage**"

2021-06-21 13:51:56,wallstreetbets,Thank you for alerting us all to Basel 3. I went and read up a little. I watch Cnbc daily and for the life of me cannot imagine why i have not heard this discussed. Its amazing how even business media picks and chooses what to tell us. I would agree this will cause gold prices to go up.

2021-06-21 12:29:34,wallstreetbets,"The market is pretty much selling 20,000% more gold than there is gold. Sound familiar? Remember how the market was selling more GME stocks than there was in existence?"
2021-06-21 13:59:11,wallstreetbets,"If the general public knew about Basel III and that their gold certificates were just pieces of paper and not representative of ANY gold they thought they bought, it would cause wide spread panic. I do not want to see that happen. But, this regulation pretty much puts an end to the scam, and holds banks responsible for the ""product"" they sell, and now has to be actually backed by the asset they claim they are selling."

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH vs $CLOV why i chose WISH Not financial advisor just sharing my trade thinking. hope is useful

Beside both being incredible growth companies I prefered going into $wish due to price action was better than $clov. 

Looking on the hourly chart you see wish holding above ema100 and ema 50 constantly bouncing from support and it is something I keep an eye on which has worked in my favor more times than not.

&#x200B;

Looking at $CLOV It constantly rejected from ema 50 and 100 that was the reason I did not play it. both great company growth stocks just thought to share.

2021-06-21 16:34:02,wallstreetbets,It’s CLOV time !!!!
2021-06-21 17:52:38,wallstreetbets,CLOV is better bet
2021-06-21 13:50:27,wallstreetbets,"Well, $WISH has already bottomed and starting a bounce back, while $CLOV has flattened and is just about gathering strength to start an upwards trend. So they're about the same, with $CLOV having more sentiment and hype in the long run."

2021-06-21 11:43:54,wallstreetbets,"CLOV is becoming the most shorted stock by the second, been watching this stock for 8 days. Pure manipulation."
2021-06-21 13:17:31,wallstreetbets,"I don't know that much about WISH other than it made people a lot of money and they sell cheap trinkets to girls. I feel like that's probably a very good business. However, here is why I decided to semi-yolo into CLOV with my AMC (1,000%+) winnings. I feel like it's an incredible value buy right now, squeeze or no squeeze.

&#x200B;

* 49% Short Interest with 100% utilization and super high costs to borrow according to ORTEX (6/21). This is somehow fucking increasing, wtf!
* 100/100 Squeeze Score from S3 (Ihor)
* $720,000,000 in cash, no debt
* No threat of stock dilutions or market offering
* Insider's can't sell stock unless stock is >$30 for 90 days
* 45.6% increase in revenue 2020 over 2019  
Net loss $91.6m (2020) vs $363.7m (2019)  
Projected revenue 2021 $810-$830m vs $672m 2020 revenue and $462m 2019 revenue.
* Citadel owns 7x more AMC than CLOV, they take positions in stocks they short as a hedge or secret final weapon.
* Machine Learning AI Assistant for doctors and works with Medicare (growth market)
* Victim of hit piece from shorting hedge fund FUD Hindenburg (same people who slandered DKNG falsely in laughable reports), DOJ investigation from months ago hasn't gone anywhere
* Let's be real, high org ownership is actually kind of good for this squeeze, they're far more diamond handed than day traders or brand new apes.
* Last run up was from $10 to almost $30 - only 5% of shorts covered! For a 3x return we only had 5% cover. Imagine if we forced them all to cover. They've only seen a FRACTION of our POWER.

This is a fundamentally sound business using machine learning and AI to help docs make smart decisions with patient care. This both increases the quality of care and reduces cost of care, something our country desperately needs. Be a patriot, consider CLOV!

**Not a financial advisor or any kind of advisor. Don't listen to me.**"
2021-06-21 11:37:31,wallstreetbets,"CLOV, yes nice colors"
2021-06-21 11:41:07,wallstreetbets,I’m starting to think that the whole club thing really was a edgy trick. I have clov and wish though
2021-06-21 14:21:10,wallstreetbets,Wish just does not have the short squeeze potential. I'm in clov..... Sorry

2021-06-21 18:15:28,wallstreetbets,Wish was offered a big buyout from Amazon a few years back.. if Amazon doesn’t think they are a good enough play to swallow them at a big discount then I won’t waste my time with that bet.. CLOV and the emergence of AI in the Medicare field = growth and 💵 I’m taking my shot with CLOV 🍀🍀🍀

This week $WISH could reach $20, in 6 months $50, in 1 year $90.

2021-06-21 16:32:18,wallstreetbets,I choose neither. Because i will not be burned by these distraction stocks geared for them to steal capital from us to pay for the inevitable blast off from GME. The days of going around tricking people are over

DKNG got a boost recently with an Ark investment after short report selloff and still is one of the main players in the popular sportsbook sector while RUN benefitting from the rise in clean energy stocks, drop in overall sector prices and a guidance of 25% to 30% growth in the near future; grid instability in TX and CA may draw even more demand for RUN. What do you think, bros, or maybe something entirely different???

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"This is what will happen to the housing market There is going to be (it has already started) inflation.
This way countries will have “lowered” their debt.

Many jobs will be mainly remote this will cause companies to reduce office spaces or close branches. 
Many will prefer to live out of the cities.
Many of these offices will be reconverted to apartments in the meanwhile interests will be the increased.
Many people will be fired thus their house will be taken back from the bank.

This increase in availability of homes, less demand and reduce home prices.


Some countries will be affected more than others I don’t think the crash will be like in 2008 but a 20-25% loss will is what my feelings say. And you guys should trust my feelings. Why? Because I say so

Interests will be risen to max 3-3,5%"

2021-06-21 10:48:10,wallstreetbets,More people will want to buy houses outside of the cities... but there will still be less demand? Home builders needs to build homes at a record pace for 5 years just to meet the current demand plus the increased demand from Millennials entering the prime home-buying age. Lumber futures are way down which will ease the cost of building a home in the next few months. The housing market may cool down from the standpoint that the prices will not be rising double-digit percentages every year... but I wouldn't expect a drop in prices.
2021-06-21 10:49:32,wallstreetbets,You were probably 5 in 2008.
2021-06-21 10:52:08,wallstreetbets,WWHAT TICKER DO WE BUY!!!!111??
2021-06-21 11:00:09,wallstreetbets,"Lmao you have no clue. I do not think you understand the catalysts that are the driving the housing market. 
You say people will be working remote and closing offices yet you think demand for houses will go down? That will only further drive the demand for houses. Not everyone can work a full day on Starbucks wifi genius.

Business suites cannot just be turned into housing. They usually don't meet zoning requirements for environmental impact, they don't have the plumbing and other utility infrastructure to support full-time residents amongst a plethora of other reasons. This is pretty common knowledge, as it's been a major point of contention with cities trying to get their homeless off the street and into transitional housing via office conversions. It doesn't happen. 

AAA mortgages are already above 3% for conventional loans. Even if rates jump from 3% to 6% that is not going to deter buyers. Those are still historically low rates considering tier 1 rates in the 90's were hovering around 10%. People are returning to work, offices are filling back up. New construction for commercial spaces is at a record pace. I can't hire journeyman electricians fast enough to keep up with the demand here in the Northwest."
2021-06-21 10:47:50,wallstreetbets,Why 20-25% and not 0-5%?

2021-06-21 11:04:17,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that how it works in a casino?
2021-06-21 11:09:41,wallstreetbets,"Children don't know anything, let alone are prophets.

Nice try though."
2021-06-21 16:09:11,wallstreetbets,People have no idea how crazy this correction is going to be.   I already have the wheels in motion to unload my property the end of this year and go rent something while hunger games breaks out.  When the market turns the buyers will have the upper hand and it’s not going to be pretty.
2021-06-21 10:57:43,wallstreetbets,Ya you guys in Canada are getting fucked more than us in the USA. That shits a major problem and really needs to be addressed some way or another by your government. I feel bad for y’all.
2021-06-21 11:07:33,wallstreetbets,"Ok small town wasn’t the correct wording, you are correct. 


Regardless, I ain’t paying $250k for a two bed one bath in the woods 😂

The houses we have looked at are deep outside of the area. Not so much as to being directly in Eugene."
2021-06-21 10:56:17,wallstreetbets,"Which is fine and dandy, and I plan to hold out for a bit longer, but for now I’m just filling someone else’s pocket with rent money. 

Fortunately, my girlfriend and I are in strong fields and can afford to own a $250k home, but we would rather wait for it to maybe be $200k and then spring on it. It’s a tough game. Pay rent, or buy an overpriced house."
2021-06-21 11:09:39,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, just because I can afford a $2k mortgage doesn’t mean I WANT that high of one. One of loses our job and we’re fucked ya know?"
2021-06-21 11:17:23,wallstreetbets,">around here a 2/1 home will run something like $350-400k if it's in move-in condition.

That's disgusting."
2021-06-21 11:13:43,wallstreetbets,So that means if there was enough houses 5 years ago there is also now
2021-06-21 11:05:38,wallstreetbets,"No? Not at all, lol.

Have you ever been to a casino?"
2021-06-21 11:22:57,wallstreetbets,Cassandra disagrees
2021-06-21 17:09:10,wallstreetbets,Exactly. They are in a delusional state
2021-06-21 11:05:38,wallstreetbets,"Our government is a joke, they are part of the issue with the housing market. Trudeau keeps taking loans from the central banks and making them print money, which In turn is driving inflation through the roof. There was a conference to even address this issue and Trudea dodged the questions and refused to acknowledge what he is doing. 

I can only hope that people who get in the market buy within their means and understand if interest goes up, they need to be covered for that. I also don't think covid is helping for any of us. 

You'll get in though, patience will definitely be key and keep your eye on the market, even if your not ready to buy just yet, you can learn alot from what's happening."
2021-06-21 11:13:57,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. Yeah that's a hard pill to swallow to buy something in the sticks. Haha.
2021-06-21 10:59:42,wallstreetbets,">It’s a tough game. Pay rent, or buy an overpriced house.

Yeah, it is. We bought in 2015 when it was still relatively a buyers market and there are some days where I wish we hadn't and still rented. Considering we both WFH now(didn't then), it would be the better option since we could live where the fuck ever and wouldn't be house bound."
2021-06-21 11:23:11,wallstreetbets,"No, that is not what it means. 

There are an estimated 140,000,000 single family homes in the US. Home ownership increased 3.8% from Q2 2019 to Q2 2020. That means the demand for homes increased by over 5 million homes in that time period of 1 year. That's almost twice as many total homes that were built between the years 2015-2019. So if demand is outpacing development by multiples of nearly 8x, explain to me how there are enough homes?"
2021-06-21 11:08:04,wallstreetbets,I lose all my money there each month so I guess yes..?
2021-06-21 11:24:33,wallstreetbets,"Being the parent of a 13 year old, I've long since discovered that children have more layers stupidity and blind arrogance than I have will to correct it.

2021-06-21 17:13:06,wallstreetbets,I have clients that are paying 40k-75k over asking for houses and most of the time they are bringing that as cash because the houses aren’t appraising for the full offer.  Crazy times we are living in.
2021-06-21 11:13:49,wallstreetbets,"Been watching it like a hawk since last year. And shit ya I forgot covid still has Canada buy the balls, we actually are doing alright where I’m at in the US now. Which is surprising to say the least."
2021-06-21 11:01:35,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, that’s the reason I haven’t even considered buying a house here. I am work from home, but my GF is not (she’s in the medical field as a lab tech and will always require to go in) but we do NOT want to live in the Midwest. That’s why we are wanting to buy a house out there, however, say we move there and two years later we fucking hate it. Boom, stuck. 

It’s a really difficult decision that I personally don’t even want to think about. It’s exciting and frustrating at the same time haha ."
2021-06-21 11:25:12,wallstreetbets,I am evaluating a European point of view (which is diverse but still similar in comparison to US)
2021-06-21 11:09:23,wallstreetbets,And you want us to go by what you say? 😂
2021-06-21 11:28:02,wallstreetbets,Aren’t kids a copy of their parents?
2021-06-21 18:08:42,wallstreetbets,"Where I live people do the same, and it’s for ugly old houses"
2021-06-21 11:07:30,wallstreetbets,"> but we do NOT want to live in the Midwest.

As someone who was born in the SE but lives in the Midwest now, fuck this place, lol. We are working on the house to sell it and sellers market or not, we don't plan on being here forever. 

>It’s a really difficult decision that I personally don’t even want to think about.

If I can give you any advice, it's to buy with the intention of selling in 5-6 years. Have a way out, so when the time comes you aren't stuck in a region you may grow to hate. That mindset will dictate what you buy, how much you're willing to pay for it, where it's located and a lot of other factors you may not be thinking about at the time. 

That's why, IMO, buying in a sellers market is a really bad decision."
2021-06-21 11:10:57,wallstreetbets,YOLO
2021-06-21 11:33:04,wallstreetbets,"Only a kid would believe something so stupid.

Fuck no. Kids are individuals that make their own choices, have their own personalities and their own ideas. Parents raise children, yes. 

My point was, children, all of them, are stupid. Because the brain is still developing. Unfortunately, kids, like you, have access to the internet and as a result can type all of their stupid little thoughts out with little repercussion and desire for correction. Because if someone says you're an idiot and explains why, being a kid, you'll pull the arrogant card and ignore it."
2021-06-21 11:11:05,wallstreetbets,"There really isn’t shit going on in this part of the country. Don’t get me wrong, I love drinking beer, but if that’s all we do every weekend then I’d rather go elsewhere lmao.


Appreciate the advise though! It’s the next big step in our lives, and it’s more stressful than college / finding a job was haha. Those were the easy parts, now onto this challenge."
2021-06-21 11:36:41,wallstreetbets,Ok
2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Looks like $WISH is back on the menu this week Bought today 10.00am

[I have a $WISH](https://preview.redd.it/ppoilwrkwm671.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=19d4dd29eac46c818483335a71e2cc6ee7159d4d)

&#x200B;

Position update at 3.20pm:

&#x200B;

[To hold untill the moon](https://preview.redd.it/xm0g68gh6o671.png?width=1135&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e2a40c8269bf25224e548412623e849d4e18ec1)

$WISH already with more than double the call volume to open interest in the first 30min of trading. 12.5C with 5x the volume/OI.

**EDIT: at 11.50 call volume is over 200.000 contracts, which is over 7 times the OI. Shares traded are 5 times the average volume.**

&#x200B;

If this continues we could be heading towards another $WISH ride.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/scvori7mrm671.png?width=2734&format=png&auto=webp&s=018f77060e7509d58f637ced9e177741f1be4c01

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**EDIT: And it continues moving calls and shares:**

10x the average daily volume of shares traded - the whole free float has been traded today;

15x the call Open Interest was traded today - meaning, over 430.000 call contracts traded today

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kew1sbpk7o671.png?width=2728&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d36e106d8718f5bc1ad35ebf07cef07b41546d0

**This is exactly what happened with $CLOV one day before it gapped up with a huge green candle - (cf.** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuo1kj/clov_45k_deep_otm_weekly_yolo_310000_call/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv4nvy/clov_option_volume_ongoing_hourly_updates/)) 

&#x200B;

Daily volume is already at the double average volume. So definitely we have interest in the stock this week

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm in for $10K in the 15C - I might just triple down tho

2021-06-21 10:36:24,wallstreetbets,Wish is the only meme stock with solid fundamentals. 30 plus by EOY with or without WSB.
2021-06-21 14:51:58,wallstreetbets,"Why are they calling the apes? The apes are all-in on GME, laughing at these PnD short plays while they eat their bananas"

2021-06-21 14:17:43,wallstreetbets,"$WISH may or may not fly to new heights today. Buy the dips for sure, but do so in the knowledge that this is almost certainly in your interests to take a more traditional long position, rather than wishing for it to do a $GME on any given day. 

Wish earnings beat estimates; the stonk is trading significantly below analyst forecasts and the board is finally waking up to the fact that they need to focus on customer service and help weed out shitbag sellers who send you a box of dogshit instead of a PS5.

The broader economy is heading for trouble. Inflation is up, interest rates are going up and wages are stagnating. Amazon seem to be happy to let customer service slide (longer delivery times, higher prices) all of which compound to make Wish much more attractive to budget-conscious shoppers. As the economy tanks, Wish will almost certainly rise."

GME was the exception not the rule. If you actually like the stock and the company you want it to make incremental steps up towards your desired value. If you’re just in it for the gap up then none of this matters."

2021-06-21 11:12:35,wallstreetbets,BB and GME have no revenue growth. Actually declining YoY.

2021-06-21 14:08:18,wallstreetbets,No I just make money off of them
2021-06-21 18:51:11,wallstreetbets,Didnt realize you were using a term that was made and applied to the GME crowd you mean?
2021-06-21 11:15:20,wallstreetbets,Tell your boss kenny .g that I just bought more shares cause of this 😂if this shit ran back in January I would have sold at 30$ 😂your all getting beat by a guy who had to google how to spell finance 😂
2021-06-21 11:23:22,wallstreetbets,"Well I’m tapped for cash and I have over 2k shares so I’m straight on that. But if I were you, do research on the wash sale rule."

2021-06-21 11:18:11,wallstreetbets, just make some money dude.  its easy.
2021-06-21 13:23:48,wallstreetbets,Wash is for losses not gains….
2021-06-21 11:19:19,wallstreetbets,It’s kinda hard when shitadel manipulates the market constantly 😂
2021-06-21 13:26:45,wallstreetbets,"Question: if one buys a stock and sells for gain and then buys a day later but on the dip and sells again, how does that play out?"
2021-06-21 11:20:43,wallstreetbets,manipulation is the name of the game broseph
2021-06-21 13:27:39,wallstreetbets,You pay tax on gains
2021-06-21 11:21:19,wallstreetbets,"Buddy I can’t possibly buy any more shares now ….
Ok maybe just one more amc share"
2021-06-21 13:28:33,wallstreetbets,So basically I could do this shit with another stock over and over and just have to pay taxes? I got the wrong info from my broker
2021-06-21 11:23:00,wallstreetbets,lmao do it my friend!  AMC is unstoppable
2021-06-21 13:31:29,wallstreetbets,Yes wash sale kicks in when you realize a loss and then buy the same stock inside 30days. You are unable to claim these losses on taxes. If your just making gains you just pay tax on any gains made.

2021-06-21 11:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Don’t fuck with long oil.  Take profits and run.  The economy runs on cheap oil, so there is incentive by the feds to suppress the price."

2021-06-21 10:54:30,wallstreetbets,New to this. Getting my advice and lessons from this sub. If I’ve learned one thing so far. It’s that I’m a retard. Bought 2000 worth of BB when it was at like 19 or something close.

Why does the news that BB is going to be in a metric fuck ton of Chinese cars bring down the price? I don't understand this stock..."
2021-06-21 10:23:36,wallstreetbets,ive been bagholding bb since january

2021-06-21 10:31:03,wallstreetbets,Sell some CCs. Not financial advice
2021-06-21 15:37:08,wallstreetbets,"BB will have it’s time, just need some patience"
2021-06-21 13:26:32,wallstreetbets,Nice. Sell covered calls every time this thing gets pumped over the next few months and you won't even have to sweat the dips.
2021-06-21 14:25:59,wallstreetbets,Get your cheap stock before earnings report! BB gonna pop!
2021-06-21 14:40:47,wallstreetbets,You’re only down 16%.  I’m down 25%. :(
2021-06-21 14:54:08,wallstreetbets,"BB is a great company with a very bright future, hold, it’s not just a meme stock."
2021-06-21 15:26:03,wallstreetbets,"Stronger together!   4 calls at $21 exp 12/17 currently at a -80% total return  


Also 212 shares good for a -24% haha

Just. Keep. Stacking."
2021-06-21 15:53:56,wallstreetbets,Im holding 50 shares at 15 Im having a hard time with understanding why this stock isn’t being talked about lol. Bb is a decent company

2021-06-21 10:25:04,wallstreetbets,BB is done for now
2021-06-21 10:27:38,wallstreetbets,Fuck BB in its arse
2021-06-21 10:17:57,wallstreetbets,When will you sell?
2021-06-21 15:10:20,wallstreetbets,"You guys actually bought BB, lol"
2021-06-21 18:12:54,wallstreetbets,"With all the shares you got why not sell covered calls? . I only own 100 shares but I sold one contract today with strike price of 15 expering Friday, $29 income! Not a financial advice just an ape daydreaming here"
2021-06-21 11:05:09,wallstreetbets,and thats only the beginning....hope your wifes bf has a decent job
2021-06-21 16:45:37,wallstreetbets,Literally the worse sub you can come to for advice and lessons. You are a true retard.
2021-06-21 18:04:25,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls on them. Get what you can.
2021-06-21 15:44:56,wallstreetbets,Then you don’t understand stocks. Once it’s in the news it’s too late
2021-06-21 14:52:21,wallstreetbets,I don’t either. I’ve had a lot of luck with BYD. They mainly supply Chinese electric cars with batteries. I’ve had great luck with them and I hope BB follows suite. I’m being very patient with BB.
2021-06-21 11:49:56,wallstreetbets,Same and im keep holding boight all the dips at 8-9-10€ too 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-21 14:10:33,wallstreetbets,"I know right, -16% is rookie numbers i held through -60%"
2021-06-21 10:25:16,wallstreetbets,BB takes a dump every day.
2021-06-21 13:53:05,wallstreetbets,idk what you are talking about. SPY is up big today.
2021-06-21 15:56:57,wallstreetbets,Had the best day in the market in the last two weeks even with some heavy bags. Market is awesome today
2021-06-21 15:03:43,wallstreetbets,"140 sounds good, but I'm betting if anything happens, it will be $60 tops by EOY. Feel like the big guys are intentionally ignoring it especially with all this hype on GME, AMC, etc. 

The biggest problem seems like people who bought at the top and bailed. Not a great situation if you're in BB for the short term. Long haul this thing will be huge. And if anything major happens with BB and Amazon? Fucking hell, this will be wild.

Inb4 shitty DD and also not financial advice, etc."
2021-06-21 11:11:47,wallstreetbets,"At what price point though? With earnings this week, you may be forced to unfavorably roll or miss out on some gains."
2021-06-21 10:43:21,wallstreetbets,How to fumble the bag 101
2021-06-21 10:19:33,wallstreetbets,What’s that?
2021-06-21 16:47:15,wallstreetbets,I’ll take that as a compliment
2021-06-21 19:34:05,wallstreetbets,Worst* so are you.
2021-06-21 18:56:40,wallstreetbets,Buy the hype sell the news
2021-06-21 12:00:04,wallstreetbets,Until it doesn’t
2021-06-21 19:39:11,wallstreetbets,"For how low volume was today, the fact it barely moved around says how bad ass we are at holding these shares and buying the dips"
2021-06-21 15:56:46,wallstreetbets,By market he means his holdings
2021-06-21 14:25:23,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts, SPY QQQ DIA all up."
2021-06-21 16:03:44,wallstreetbets,You know the previous comment was 5 hours ago. You okay there bud?
2021-06-21 11:15:30,wallstreetbets,Far OTM just for some extra income if you're bagholding. Just pick a price point where you wouldnt be upset if you got assigned
2021-06-21 10:23:37,wallstreetbets,It’s when you take the pickle out of your ass and accept defeat and move on
2021-06-21 19:35:01,wallstreetbets,I’ll take that as a compliment
2021-06-21 12:25:36,wallstreetbets,That's what I'm waiting for.
2021-06-21 11:34:25,wallstreetbets,"Not financial advice, but are you talking weeklies or further out? An 18c is only getting you 13$ for this week, but a 9/17 25c gets you 91$."
2021-06-21 11:16:14,wallstreetbets,$12 beats the hell out of $1 where it is headed unless it gets a miracle as doubt BB will ever sell a phone again! I've watched so many people ride stocks into the dirt it amazes me that people investing don't know when to cut your losses and reevaluate a position or even lock in gains...as the hedge funds I see egging all this on needs to teach some fundamentals if this isn't a cash grab hustle from Millionaires looking to cash out dog stocks? I would LOVE to see a chart of the ratio of people in WSB (also Robinhood)  who have made money vs the people who lost their asses (or lives) because of not being educated properly on how to invest and handed the keys is like handing a 3 year old a loaded gun!
2021-06-21 13:58:26,wallstreetbets,Some of us are up?
2021-06-21 12:34:12,wallstreetbets,"Gotta collect those fat stinky BB dumps, ask for more even!! Little do they know we're using that night soil for our garden...our 💸MONEY💸GARDEN💸. 

WE'RE GROWING SOME BB BEANS OUT HERE,  🌱  m a g i c  🌱  b e a n s  🌱  , and we're gonna climb those beanstalks to the GOLDEN GOOSE of PROFIT 🚀💎💰🦢💰🚀💎🚀💰🦢💰💎🚀"
2021-06-21 12:45:18,wallstreetbets,If the price point stays the same you'd make 13 more $ selling weeklies between now and 9/17
2021-06-21 12:11:37,wallstreetbets,Imagine thinking BB is still a phone company?
2021-06-21 11:30:20,wallstreetbets,"As long as they’re buying and I’m selling, I’m ok with the wealth destruction"
2021-06-21 11:56:08,wallstreetbets,"You outed yourself as completely ignorant in your first sentence when you mentioned phones. You shit on a stock and rant about people losing money and not knowing what they're doing, and you think BB is still in, or ever hopes to be, in the phone business. Fucking 🤡"
2021-06-21 15:39:53,wallstreetbets,I like your ape logic.  Might buy more BB tomorrow.
2021-06-21 13:24:39,wallstreetbets,"13$ total per contract? I think I'd take the 9/17 for the decreased risk of assignment and dealing with volatility. If I were to hold the stock until 2022 regardless, it doesn't really matter what happens with the underlying value (unless it shoots to 25$, where I would be more than happy to be assigned)."
2021-06-21 12:37:12,wallstreetbets,Imagine IBM is a pharma co is about as relevant? Just because a billionaire can make money off the cloud don't mean broke ass foreigners will? If they was so hot shot then why have they waited so long to try to become profitable off something entirely different now in a convoluted time like now? I don't got a penny in it so what I'm saying shouldn't bother you if you are so sure of your DD???? Look up Boiler Rooms and tell me how this is any different?
2021-06-21 12:33:44,wallstreetbets,Ya I'm the clown investing in a company that thinks it is easy to shift completely your product while broke in another country! :) Do tell! Ride that mf'er into the dirt for all I care!
2021-06-21 14:27:37,wallstreetbets,"It all depends on your cost basis, long term plans, and what you're happy with. If someone is bagholding and just wants out then selling weeklies at their cost basis would be a good plan. I like the long term outlook of BB so I'd probably be selling 1-2 months out a good ways OTM where I'd be happy to sell, and taking profits before they get too close to expiration assuming there are profits to take. Rinse and repeat. Again, not financial advice."
2021-06-21 14:39:13,wallstreetbets,"13$ overall. More micromanagement, a little more profit. If you sold 1 contract every week your total net + between the two strategies (if it worked out) would be 13$/contract. That increases linearly per contract, but if it's juicier to you to get the big premium and sit for a while, do that."
2021-06-21 19:05:34,wallstreetbets,"Again, you have no idea what you're talking about. Phones were ALWAYS secondary to BB. They aren't ""shifting their product"" at all."
2021-06-21 19:59:34,wallstreetbets,"Oh yes I'm sure their IP is worth money, but not public company billions money as the world has moved on since the old days papaw! I remember when BB was worth $140+ (off of business phones and suits of products) as I bought at $75 back then and sold at a $120 on way back down and made a few bucks when I saw the writing on the wall? Wish biscuits don't pay dividends or launch redefinition products they are a vehicle for last stage investors to cash out on rubes!"

2021-06-21 12:02:26,wallstreetbets,"06/25...

Stock split is happening 7/19. If you are going to buy calls, it would be to capitalize on the 4:1 split, understand that there will be a selloff and then ride the rebound into October/November timeframe. Cause holiday season + new gpu news.

Anything else is just throwing away money like a retard. Welcome to the club. Retard."
2021-06-21 10:30:02,wallstreetbets,"When you’re too greedy, should have sold some Friday or at least sell what you originally invested and let the rest ride!!"

2021-06-21 10:26:50,wallstreetbets,Get out while you still can
2021-06-21 11:32:49,wallstreetbets,"Did you not see the shooting star on the daily or do you just not care about obvious technical patterns? I would always be careful when buying calls on a stock that’s already had a huge run up, you can’t expect it to continue forever and people are going to take profits at some point."
2021-06-21 10:11:23,wallstreetbets,Lol chasing.
2021-06-21 12:16:31,wallstreetbets,How the fuck did you lose money on this.

2021-06-21 10:58:30,wallstreetbets,I also had calls but hedged with buying Puts cuz I had a feeling that ppl were buying shares due to the cut off dividend stock split date. People would def sell on Monday.
2021-06-21 13:12:25,wallstreetbets,Just rolled up to the 21’st before it takes a complete shit
2021-06-21 15:11:10,wallstreetbets,Hahahhaha I'm right there w you. Except 4 800 calls this week. Avg price 200 k3kkkk

2021-06-21 10:37:01,wallstreetbets,">bought after the $200 run up...

Then it's a short call"
2021-06-21 14:08:20,wallstreetbets,He means short time calls not short calls

2021-06-21 11:00:17,wallstreetbets,"Those are 4 buys, as it says at the top which make them long calls. NVDA is down today, had these been short calls sold last week then OP wouldn’t have a loss. I’m really not sure what you’re seeing but if you think I’m wrong then explain please lol"
2021-06-21 12:10:38,wallstreetbets,"you can't use real terms in this page. 

short to them means length of time. not writing options.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$RKT positioned for a textbook ""S word who cannot be named"" this week. $UWMC will pop off the next week when the pattern repeats.  Hello Apes, I'm taking off my fundamentals hat on these two stocks to discuss technicals and an opportunity that has presented itself with all of the criteria flashing green. I loaded up on both of these stocks for the tendies inbound. Let's review the criteria that are flashing green first:

1. The number of shares short should be greater than five times average daily volume
2. Shares short as a percentage of the float should be greater than 10%
3. Number of shares short should be increasing

""The number of shares short should be greater than five times the average daily volume"" Below in the first screenshot shows the short volume $18,900,000 with a 14.60 - 16.00% short ratio which is currently the 5th most shorted stock behind AMC, GME, RUN and NUAN per [Finachill.com](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today). The short interest is increasing every month and is up double since April.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/acuhkd9gkm671.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=a79e490c40047ba9d5a84acca3e923828923d7ae

&#x200B;

The last couple of days volume has been extremely low putting shares shorted about 3.82x of the last 6 days of daily volume in the screenshot below that I calculated in excel.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g6zfpd8ikm671.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ace16c2823d9437376e05e8c3ee4ab2cdcbc0bb

This is the perfect time to catch the hedge funds sleeping because average 90 day volume is around 10M but it has been cut in half recently which is why $RKT is primed to repeat history next week. With short interest increasing with a decreasing volume they will get caught sleeping as this data lags real time data which is just under 5x following this trend.

Lastly there is significant support in the options market due to the large interest in OTM calls for the 06/25 date to blow this stock past the resistance level of $21-$22 & $25.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hethw9k0lm671.png?width=1297&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cdd5fe1beb1935c77ec18842abb52e55007a0ab

Once it passes the $21-$22 price it has support to get the $25 strike in the money and it's game over  all over again as the shorts will be forced to cover over $25 igniting the Rocket into orbit.

$UWMC short interest has been on the decrease as I'm sure the hedge funds have seen it trending in WSB so they have retreated to safety but they will be back quickly. I would recommend taking the tendies from this $RKT after lift off and then we reload and wait for the same indicators to flash for $UWMC the week after and catch the hedge funds sleeping twice!

Safe flying apes **🙌🏼💎🚀**"

2021-06-21 14:34:42,wallstreetbets,They will try hard to keep it below 20 I guess. Failed to breach it in today's push.

If you buy it this fucking time you deserve to get wiped out honestly. At this point if you lose money on RKT it's just natural selection at work."

2021-06-21 14:36:27,wallstreetbets,Today's push was hopefully a good sign of the trend reversing in the bullish direction for the week with that massive buy up to get it to 19.48
2021-06-21 19:58:36,wallstreetbets,dude nice good luck! that’s a nice amount of shares
2021-06-21 10:34:57,wallstreetbets,"Yea I think once volume and price come down, short interest will increase and then it look good again from a technical perspective. Wall street has a very negative sentiment right now towards this whole industry putting pressure on it despite the 10 year yield being blow or around 1.5%"
2021-06-21 10:39:46,wallstreetbets,Weeks? I get the irritation. I've been holding on for months. Shoulda dumped at 10.30 but held like a true tard. Ill continue to hold until 15 and take divs i guess. Fuck it.
2021-06-21 10:31:02,wallstreetbets,Not trying to draw them away. Last post was on fundamentals this is on technical analysis. I'm not loyal to one stock I'm loyal to making money. If fundamentals or technicals justify a stock is primed to make money I'm in. If the data says it's a losing stock I cut my losses and get out. I don't work for either of these companies I'm just an idiot like everyone else trying to make money. I think UWMC really does have potential from a technical perspective and I plan to make a few bucks off it in the short term.
2021-06-21 10:14:39,wallstreetbets,"^Yes, ^you're ^probably ^about ^to ^be ^banned."
2021-06-21 13:53:48,wallstreetbets,Not necessarily. This is a new feature they implemented for DD.
2021-06-21 14:13:53,wallstreetbets,"Ok give me a guess here, is tomorrow going to be a bigger day or sometime later this week ?"
2021-06-21 16:38:42,wallstreetbets,Im back with only 2 things to do.  Kick ASS and chew bubblegum. And I'm all out of bubble gum!
2021-06-21 14:09:45,wallstreetbets,$26 6/25 $.04 . At $4 a piece no harm if they don’t print
2021-06-21 10:47:46,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm just going to stay the course cause my DD tells me it can pop. It's very risky, but I think this might run very soon... if it actually is added to the Russell, only time will tell."
2021-06-21 19:39:24,wallstreetbets,"I love the company and they have delivered amazing results , before the SQ they always were stable keeping 24-27 range and then plummeted because the FUD and HF taking advantage, this company based on performance is way undervalued and also multifaceted. Let’s see not fun to see all red ink around this position .."
2021-06-21 19:53:09,wallstreetbets,Housing Data is going to be release tomorrow so hopefully if its good it will be a boost for RKT 🚀 🚀 🚀.
2021-06-21 10:45:33,wallstreetbets,yea that's true at least you get div's. It's alright I had RKT since last August and never sold a share when it hit $40 so I'm in the same boat lol
2021-06-21 10:32:49,wallstreetbets,"""loyal to making money"" Buying $RKT 🤡"
2021-06-21 10:32:19,wallstreetbets,Your account history shows a clear bias for rkt.
2021-06-21 13:56:30,wallstreetbets,ok cool yea saw this on a few others today too
2021-06-21 14:15:36,wallstreetbets,it’s hard to say when exactly it will happen if it’s going to happen the key is momentum once it starts to get those calls in the money expiring 6/25
2021-06-21 16:45:53,wallstreetbets,hide your children
2021-06-21 14:10:43,wallstreetbets,great stuff my man best of luck! We got this
2021-06-21 10:49:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah i agree the only problem is people having been saying this will pop for months. I chose it cause i thought it was most solid company on this sub…but i guess thats not what makes a true meme stock
2021-06-21 19:52:46,wallstreetbets,I literally could not agree with you more. Undervalued big time on fundamentals and huge growth potential with rocket mortgage and rocket autos. I’ve done some DDs from a fundamentals perspective. Have you written any?
2021-06-21 10:37:06,wallstreetbets,Like I said I have more stocks than just RKT. I have plenty more stocks that I'm bagholding too that are doing way worse than RKT that I never post about. I post when I think there is potential for a stock to go up. I'm actually even on RKT so idc what it does in the short term I'm long the stock
2021-06-21 10:45:36,wallstreetbets,"So? Rkt has made me money like 7 times since January. It's a moving stock, which means it's a moneymaker if you're in sync with it.

I'm biased for any stock that makes money too."
2021-06-21 10:33:36,wallstreetbets,it does but that's b/c I think the stock is a great long term hold. I think UWMC is great  short term when the technicals justify it. RKT is not my only stock I hold
2021-06-21 15:25:55,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your post. I am up from -70% to +50% and then -5% now. I averaged down after your post. When I checked the technicals and also matched by going back in time. Looks solid
2021-06-21 14:12:29,wallstreetbets,Good luck to you as well! 🤘🏼🚀
2021-06-21 10:54:07,wallstreetbets,"The meme game is tough for me too, I just like to focus on capital / share structure and the company itself - that gives me an edge and helps me identify plays that can short squeeze / gamma squeeze."
2021-06-21 10:57:01,wallstreetbets,It's hard to time fomo. Also you could argue the pop happened months ago in February when it ran to $14
2021-06-21 10:42:39,wallstreetbets,"Best of luck sir, I just don't see it doing much in the future."
2021-06-21 15:28:00,wallstreetbets,anytime! thank you

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TLRY DD: 25%+ Revenue and EPS Growth, Why it is EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED after 80% Selloff. $116 PT!  

**Total Addressable Market (TAM) Evaluation:**

Tilray Operates in three main regions: Canada, Europe, United States.

Canada:

* Expected to reach $4 Billion in Cannabis sales by end of 2021. Tilray has a 17% market share, with a goal to reach 30%
* Canada's cannabis market is expected to grow twice as fast as the U.S. market between 2020 and 2021 and almost three times faster from 2021 to 2022
* Tilray is well positioned with strong edible, vape, and beverage brands as users steadily switch to cannabis 2.0 products
* Canadian black market is nearly the same size as the legal market, however it is steadily declining which adds TAM for LP’s

Europe:

* EU GDP = $15 Trillion
* Population = 600 Million
* GMP certified grow facility in Portugal can export anywhere in EU 
* Dominant position in Germany with CC Pharma distribution network (access to 13,000 pharmacies)
* European cannabis market to be worth $3.8 Billion USD by 2025, growing at a 67.4% CAGR

United States:

* CBD market growing at a CAGR of 42%, expected to reach $13 Billion by 2024
* Manitoba Harvest sells CBD and Hemp products throughout the U.S. in grocery stores and online (Amazon)
* SweetWater Brewery sells cannabis themed alcohol nationally in 29,000+ grocery stores. Upon legalization they can begin crafting and distributing CBD and THC products using their distribution network.
* Tilray does NOT currently sell ANY THC products in the U.S. because they would be at risk of losing their Nasdaq listing.
   * SAFE Banking (bipartisan support) can potentially change this and allow them to execute an M&A deal with an MSO as well as allow them to begin producing and selling THC products inside the U.S. (Can NOT export cannabis from Canada)

Analysts are wrong:

* This graph shows the average price target, and Tilray stock price
* One obvious pattern is that Tilray is bullish when it is above the average analyst target.
* 2 years ago the average price target was 40-80, and now the fundamentals are better than ever, and analysts only expect the share price to reach 22

[Tilray Price compare to Consensus Price Target](https://preview.redd.it/qkwyy0zi8m671.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ba95ebdc77e397ff2e07e030d9a289929bd508)

My Technical Analysis:

* The first Fibonacci level of interest for a retracement of the move from 300 to 2 is the .382 level which has a price of 116, hence the 116 price target.
* This lines up perfectly with my Elliot Wave analysis which has a projection for a new wave higher into the Fib level

**Summary:**

Tilray is the dominant player in two high growth international markets that are expected to grow much faster than the U.S. providing 25-35% sales CAGR over the next 2+ years. EPS is expected to turn positive in the next 1-2 Years, Sales are projected to be over $1 Billion by 2022. Despite being the largest player in Canada by market share, Tilray trades at a price/sales ratio of 13 while competitors Sundial, Cronos and CGC trade at 38, 59 and 20 PS respectively.

2021-06-21 10:51:12,wallstreetbets,"Had 400 shares of $APHA that converted to $TLRY. I'm 2 1/2 years into a 5-year hold. This company has established a huge footprint internationally, and the case for prohibition is crumbling all over the Western world. The major issue to legalization in most countries is politicians haven't been able to figure out how to get their slice of the pie. If the U.S. gets federal legalization, $TLRY has to become a target for acquisition, and the liquor lobby continues to fight like hell against this and they've been paying politicians for 100 years. A whole generation is growing up with a mindset that weed is less harmful than alcohol, and they don't understand why it's not fully legal. Weed legalization is a voting issue for these people, so stick up the ass politicians fighting against it are spitting into the wind.     

I'm committed to the stock and its long term prospects."

Those old PT’s (and TLRY’s old share prices) are totally irrelevant to today’s share price. It’s comparing apples and oranges. Look up a historical chart of the company’s market cap.

When TLRY was trading over $200/sh it’s market cap was almost half of what it is now while trading at $17/sh.

Being bullish on TLRY is fine, but a huge basis of this post is totally out of whack due to massive share dilution over the years"

2021-06-21 09:54:03,wallstreetbets,Many inaccuracies within this. Tilray is definitely not the best way to play weed…. LONG MSOS and MSOs.

Why? because 99% of the trading volume is gonna come from retail and the only thing retail gives a shit about is momentum from legalization hype. 

Right now, US is priced in and the next area is probably going to be Europe. Don't touch TLRY until rumors start spreading of EU legalization."

Tilray's original float was \~95 Million and they had issued \~ 40 million shares. So you are somewhat correct but it's not *as* big of an influence because the majority of the reason for changes in market cap are the Aprhia merger. You can compare the market cap from 3 years ago to now, but you can also compare the Price/Sales ratio (or any ratio) which they valued Tilray at. For ex. when Tilray was 40 and they had an 80 target they were suggesting an appropriate P/S was well over 100, but now they are suggesting a fair P/S is less than 20. Many ways to look at it"

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GSAT $3.25 price target initiated at B. Riley Some Of you may remember my GSAT DD from a few months back.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrdg2q/gsat_dd_its_the_spectrum_stupid/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  

There, I outlined why this little Louisiana satellite company might be the ultimate 5G play. Since then, the share price went down, and it also went up, and it was also added to the Russell effective later this week. Globalstar also received a 37.5 million dollar advance payment on an unspecified contract, which many believe has got to be a spectrum trial (otherwise, why keep it a secret?)

AND NOW, it looks like price targets have begun to reflect the bull case I laid out. As of this morning, B. Riley has initiated coverage with a price target of $3.25. 

Here’s their write up:

B. Riley Securities initiates GSAT with a Buy and price target of $3.25. Analyst Mike Crawford said, ""We believe Globalstar and its sponsors, after years of development, support, and patience, are at long last starting to realize a return on satellite system and spectrum assets, making 2021 an excellent time, in our opinion, to buy GSAT before the market digests this change. We believe many investors perceive GSAT as a long-suffering, over-leveraged mobile satellite services (MSS) provider with spectrum assets that have been difficult to monetize. In contrast, our investment thesis is that Globalstar has moved through the high-risk portion of its history and is now poised to start generating returns on its hard-fought terrestrial spectrum authorization, primarily including 11.5 MHz of 2.4 GHz S-Band spectrum in the U.S., as well as 16.5 MHz of 2.4 MHz international spectrum with no power limitations. GSAT also operates a sunk-cost MSS business that is generating positive operating cash flow, which we believe actually bottomed in 1Q21. As such, we see Globalstar's low-data-rate satellite business returning to growth, with cash flow further bolstered by domestic and international spectrum monetization agreements—and with GSAT's first $1.8B of profitability sheltered by a massive NOL that is hidden on the balance sheet by a $381M deferred tax asset valuation allowance. These aforementioned assets alone more than cover the debt and equity at current levels, in our opinion, plus GSAT has a powerful, low-theta option in the form of some 59 MHz of 5.1 GHz C-Band spectrum—representing nearly 20B MHz-POPs—as well as 8.7 MHz of 1.6 GHz LBand spectrum that the company could monetize down the road, as well. At the high end, we estimate that this C-Band spectrum alone could be worth some $15B. For now, based on a midcase sum-of-the-parts analysis of GSAT's terrestrial spectrum, MSS, and tax assets, we arrive at a targeted $4.5B EV and a $2.35 stock price. Plus, we factor in just a 15% value realization probability to GSAT's C-Band and L-Band spectrum, at the midpoint adding ~$0.90/share to our inaugural SOTP, to constitute our $3.25/share PT."""

Put = stock will sink past this strike price.

The ""premium"" (what you pay for the privilege of owning that strike price) is what the people selling the calls deem is an acceptable return on the risk they're taking to sell you the call. 

If you hold until the expiry date, you want the price to be Strike+Premium paid or higher (your ""breakeven"" price).

Otherwise, if you intend to sell before expiration, just watch the happy green numbers and sell when they're big enough for you to be happy with the profit."

Cause at the top, they sold shares and made money when it was up and they were touting how close they were to EUA. I haven’t sold my shares yet though. Like you, hoping it recovers. Dammit."

2021-06-21 19:46:40,wallstreetbets,You are aware that the date of expiration has nothing to do with when you decide to sell? I buy October calls when I’m planning on selling in July because IV crush will destroy the value on contracts with a July expiration if the underlying doesn’t move.

With Basil III starting to kick in at the end of July 1 in the E.U, and mortgage loan and rental forbearances here in the U.S. being lifted, unless extended, many are suggesting these are going to have a significant effect on the overall economy.  From what I can understand, Basil III is about the accounting treatment of unallocated commodity accounts that are creating a large differentials between the price of the physical commodity and the paper (the price of options and futures) such as on the COMEX and the LME. I'm personally in residential real estate so I'm expecting to start seeing some foreclosures, deeds in leu of foreclosure and short sales bringing more properties on the market, thus increasing the supply. One of the things driving up prices so much last years has been the limited supply as compared to a huge demand and low interest rates.  Hopefully this will stabilize prices and not cause a huge correction.  I think it will give up a good indicator of how strong or not the economy really is. I'm not optimistic though, especially if the FRB slows its acquisition of MBS's which it may be forced to do to slow inflation.  Is it time to do the silver squeeze on the COMEX and LME?"

2021-06-21 08:58:01,wallstreetbets,"If you look at physical prices versus spot, you'll see that, basically, two separate markets have formed.  And one of them is wrong.  Those have to converge again at some point, or the world will begin to realize that the COMEX and LBMA are just a bogus charade (which we already know them to be, from the many, many instances of market manipulation that traders have already been fined for).

Paul Tudor Jones thinks people should be going all in on commodities now.  And I don't disagree with him.

Equity valuations are too high, currencies are getting printed bigly, and virtually all debt instruments are at negative real yields.

People are convinced metals have lost their ability to protect against inflation, because it's been over 4 decades since we've seen any appreciable inflation.  Most folks who invest now don't have any idea what stagflation looks like.  This is what stagflation looks like."

2021-06-21 10:28:40,wallstreetbets,"When moratorium on evictions and foreclosures end - I would envision properties entering the market place.  Look at Blackrock purchasing whole subdivisions and neighborhoods often bidding up the price to 20 to 40% over asking price.  As world Economic Forum said - you will own nothing and be happy.   Even with low interest rates, many middle income families are priced out of owning a home due to the price appreciation.   End of Summer/Early Fall will definitely be telling.  End of Sept is also the end of the Additional Federal Unemployment benefit of $300 per week.   I know we have all seen help wanted signs or Sorry for wait time due to staffing shortage signs.    
Will housing market be in another 2008/2009 bubble?   
Bubbles, Bubbles everywhere.  
With implementation of Basel III - with banks/hedgefunds shorting the gold market to bring down the price so they can cover their shorts - might be a good time to diversity into Precious Metals (gold/silver) as a way to protect your purchasing power."
2021-06-21 10:07:20,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I'm just a heartless asshole but why would there be foreclosures when there are tons of jobs available right now?

2021-06-21 11:01:02,wallstreetbets,"Well there are naturally foreclosures anyways that have all been stopped for a year. Plus some people have not been paying their mortgage and all those payments stack up like you said. I don't know how much worse than normal it will be, but I am sure it will be worse."
2021-06-21 14:39:45,wallstreetbets,"He didn't say that.  He said if the Reddit crowd goes into commodities, the razor thin supply demand would rocket them.

IMO, the housing market is the least worrisome."
2021-06-21 12:17:40,wallstreetbets,"For mortgage forbearance, I really doubt it's end will bring about a massive wave of foreclosures like many on reddit seem to think.

Foreclosures before the pandemic were at all time lows.  So we will be coming up from those, but probably not past (or far past) normal rates.

Why do I think this:  a lot of forbearances end in the skipped payments simply being added on to the end of the mortgage, so many will not be facing a giant bill when the program ends.  Many who do have foreclosure actions taken against them will be able to sell their homes before they lose them.  Lending practices have been a lot better since 2008 and the market is red hot, so IMO far, far fewer people are going to be caught underwater on a short sale."
2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is it too late to buy $AMC ? Is it too late to buy AMC"" because I see this comment on all the YouTubers channels.  And of course the answer is ""No, it's not to late"" because if you buy at $60 or even $80, when it goes to $5,000 or $10,000 what are they going to care that they made $4,920 instead of $4,940... or even a $9,920 profit vs. a $9,940 profit.  It makes no freakin' difference in the bigger picture.  They'll just be glad that they were smart enough to buy in now, and they won't have the crying regrets of the weak-handed Chumps who sold last week at $55.

And people might say, ""But I could have bought it a month ago at $20... same thing applies: you'll make $9,940 if you buy Monday morning vs. $9,980 if you were lucky enough to know to buy a month ago.  So big f'ing deal... you'll still be making $9,940 on a $60 spend.  That's a once in a lifetime return on investment.  So please explain this to the folks that don't seem to get it.

I'll be buying the dips up to around $80; because after that, once the FOMO buying starts, and the Gamma squeeze kicks in, it'll be too late to jump on a rocket ship that has already launched.  And when the Mother of All Short Squeezes finally kicks in caused by these first two catalysts, look out: because this thing will explode upwards very quickly."

Dude, retail owns 80% of the company ffs. The ONLY people pushing the narrative that it's going to 5k or 10k are people who

1) bought the top

2) don't understand how any of this works

3) are trying to bleed more money out of people who believe #2

4) all of the above

2021-06-21 08:34:24,wallstreetbets,"Wasn’t GME supposed to go to $100,000? It got to like $400, so I somehow doubt AMC is going to $10k. $60 is probably on the high end but it could spike to maybe $100 if people really want to be bagholders."

“BlackBerry also announced that BlackBerry QNX royalty revenue backlog has increased to $490 million at the end of its first quarter of fiscal year 2022.  This represents a 9% increase, from $450 million last year.  The backlog metric is calculated using contracted prices and future production volume estimates provided by the customer when they award BlackBerry a design win.”

A 9% increase, or $40 million eventual revenue YoY is enough to do jack…

QNX auto makes no real money. Total expected backlog of revenue is merely $490 million… against a $7.5 billion market cap. If BB wanted to raise the price on QNX auto, manufacturers would just switch away."

Little bits of good news here or there are probably not going to be enough to increase the value. The stock is still 50% over what it was a month ago.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"To the Moon via Uranus: The McRib is BACK (quantitative risk analysis) 🦍💩🚀 $MCRB $ARKK **TL;DR**

\- Since before the first ape, our fates have been inextricably linked with our poop, and it's about time for a breakthrough in poop technology.  
\- There's a popular saying with holistic medicine types, 'food is medicine'. Food becomes poop. Ergo, [poop is medicine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEQREIDUJ88).  
\- Our poop is entering a new age of technological progress and Seres Therapeutics ($MCRB) is the clear leader in the multi-billion dollar opportunity of poop-based medicine, with catalyzing data coming in the next few weeks. The McRib is back in a big way.

Smart apes also use tools. Having capitalized on their first milestone, [taking 35k to 270k in options](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2rgii/35k_to_270k_betting_on_literal_poop_in_2020_round/), this formerly broke as shit ape used modern statistical methods to construct conservative quantitative risk models for the next phase of development in poop technology, with the results validating continuing to go full ape mode YOLO on MCRB.  
MCRB is overwhelmingly likely to double to previous highs on new data in a pivotal breakthrough indication (ulcerative colitis), with further long term growth potential in oncology, inflammation, immunity, and more. They are also having an investor day presentation today [here](https://ir.serestherapeutics.com/events/event-details/seres-therapeutics-investor-event).

**Abstract**  
Seres Therapeutics ($MCRB) is a Cathie Wood Approved™ microbiome therapeutics platform company developing a novel class of biological drugs. Their therapy for SER-109 in persistent bacterial GI infection (C. Diff) is nearing approval after a successful Phase 3, demonstrating that the company can deliver on less complicated applications for the technology and has the process and manufacturing to address more lucrative indications. Phase 2 of clinical trials is a pivotal de-risking milestone and is typically where most of the value of a clinical stage asset is realized. The upcoming readout for SER-287 in ulcerative colitis (UC) represents a substantial growth opportunity for MCRB, more than doubling the potential addressable market size. Published disease response rates were evaluated to construct a quantitative risk model in [PYMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/about.html), which shows a very high likelihood (\~88%) of positive results under stringent assumptions. Prior readout timelines and public statements about results “mid-year” point to announcement in July, gapping share price to ATH (\~38$). The hype cycle may have come and gone on the microbiome field \~2015, but the addressable markets are just getting ready for the disruption and Seres will lead the pack.

**Significance/Innovation**  
If you don't think poop is an opportunity for cutting-edge health care technology, all it takes is constant bleeding out of your asshole to change that perspective. Chron's and Ulcerative colitis are miserable chronic illnesses, and apes are already paying out the ass for approved drugs with unreliable effectiveness. Modifying the gut microbiome is a highly effective 'black box' approach that has had a lot of development in basic, animal, and translational research. Changing gut microbial composition affects multiple disease pathways in a manner superior to current targeted drugs for complex pathologies. In the MCRB trial, 3 groups of 67 patients (Placebo, low dose, high dose) with mild/moderate UC failing standard of care (5-ASA, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory) were treated for 10 weeks and evaluated by endoscopy for response and remission. Placebo and drug effect sizes can be reliably modeled using available data, so risk of failure is well defined, and the company has been consistent on readout timelines of 7-9 weeks after completion.

**The computer says 'YOLO'**  
To model trial success and failure probabilities in PyMC3, I reviewed published recurrence rates in randomized, controlled clinical trials of mild-moderate UC and estimated population means and 95% confidence intervals. For placebo, I used recent trials from a meta-analysis paper [(Jairath 2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483671/), Mean: 88%, 95% CI: 91%-85%. FMT trials are much less consistent in treatment and design further demonstrating need for standardized, approved therapy, so I used a conservative estimate from several studies notably [Costello 2019](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2720727?resultClick=1), M: 73%, CI: 70%-76%. Treated recurrence was taken from prior Phase I SER-287 trial and placebo meta-analysis CI, M: 60%, CI: 57%-63% ([Henn 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402096/)). These estimates were used to model distribution of patient-level treatment effect for the 67 Placebo and High Dose patients. PYMC3 was used to model the recurrence rate as binomial distributions, individual treated patient Bernoulli trials were further challenged by mixing at a 0.8 probability with 0.1 placebo response and 0.1 FMT recurrence rates.  
After patient-level draws are made for each iteration of the trial simulation, I then address the possibility that the treatment effect is statistically valid (p<0.05), but still marginal enough that analysts shit on it and we don't get our moon mission.  I do this by imposing an additional hurdle of >10% group difference in recurrence to qualify as a pass (e.g., if placebo recurrence is 60/67 (\~90%), treated group must be 53/67 or less to qualify). After hitting the magic inference button a few times and tuning the sampler hyper-parameters, a few key posterior predictions/probability density functions are: mixed patient-level recurrence probability (failure, UC flares up again within 10 weeks, a), total recurrences at the Treated Group level (b), and empirical trial failure probability after applying the 10% cut-off for difference in % remission (c).

https://preview.redd.it/eyyhxwq5zl671.png?width=4989&format=png&auto=webp&s=b146f52c8076f05afc853310e0b714fb6ef375ef

**Business logic**  
Assessing risk also involves understanding the non-public information and decision making behind the scenes. Interim/partial data analysis is standard practice for clinical trials, how a company uses this early evaluation of at the data is highly informative. This part is also a bit of Bayesian logic, but this time we're doing it in our heads. Previously, Seres Therapeutics demonstrated that they will use an early stopping option to discontinue trials that are not likely to succeed (ECOSPOR II), saving them time, money, and effort. They've also never blown their load by publishing a positive interim readout like some companies, choosing not to disclose data from the successful repeat of ECOSPOR II at all. We've long since passed the early stopping point for this trial, so we can conclude that the internal information points towards success. Management has demonstrated they are science-first and don't play games with the stock price by manipulating disclosures. I have extreme confidence in the company leadership and development approach, they have been diligent and systematic about forward progress so far and I expect that to continue.

**Conclusion**  
The risk model is very conservative, a significant proportion of patients could end up non-responders and low-responders and the trial remains a success with room to spare. The risk/reward ratio is off the charts and timing remains the largest source of uncertainty.   
My positions: 200 July calls are good for realizing day-of, 50 August is a hedge against time-line risk and potentially more upside than July if held till expiration. IRAs have shares up to the gills."

2021-06-21 17:39:43,wallstreetbets,"[BB Option Chain](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb)

Sam sells to open a cash secured put for BB at $10 a share. He is paid $.05 per share or $5 total. He is agreeing that, at the end of the week, he'll buy 100 shares at $10 a share. His broker has him set aside $1000 in case he has to pay.

End of the week comes and BB is at 

$5 - He is forced to buy the shares at $10. He keeps his $5 payment. The [price of the option](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-put.html) just before expiration was $495 to buy himself out rather than purchase the stock. 

$15 - He is not allowed to buy the shares at $10. He keeps his $5 payment. Just before expiration the price of the option dropped to nothing.

----

Bob buys to open a put for BB at $10 a share. He pays Sam $5 in exchange for their promise to buy 100 shares at $10 a share.

End of the week comes and BB is at

$5 - Bob purchases 100 shares at $5 and sells them to Sam for $10 each netting himself $5 a share or $500 profit, less his original $5 investment. (Most likely your broker would actually handle this and would just sell the option for $495 right at expiration, you should have a notification about expiring options and your choices on how to handle them).

$15 - Bob lost $5.

----

The prices of the option can vary over the week based on how much time is left and the current price same as calls. Sam can buy to close to get himself out of the deal if he wants to get access to his $1000 again or if he feels the price might drop to where he's going to have to pay for a worthless stock. And Bob can sell to close to give someone else the ability to force Sam to make the purchase if he feels the price is right and doesn't trust the direction the stock will go."
2021-06-21 17:46:27,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you should ~~buy~~ YOLO some puts to learn
2021-06-21 17:13:01,wallstreetbets,40 percent is almost always assured.

2021-06-21 17:44:57,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this. I copied the text to my notes to read over it thoroughly a couple times.

Truth is, I got an A- in graduate statistical thermodynamics and an A in quantum mechanics. But my fatal flaw is that there's always one single thing that I'll stumble across that just doesn't click for me. Puts are that.

I started studying investing back in 2007 and paper traded until 2015. I read old and new books on options and all sorts of explanations.

Puts are *that* thing that I just don't get. 

So I'm going to read your comment again and again until it clicks :)

Thank you for taking the time to teach! (Imma hop on an alt and hook you up with some gold)

2021-06-21 16:07:52,wallstreetbets,when it's green you know something is wrong.
2021-06-21 17:48:46,wallstreetbets,"A lot of these don't click until you deal with them, depending on the cash you're willing to throw around find some cheap stock to play with. Sell a put for Sundial or something and you'll either end up with the stock or a small bit of extra cash. If you get the cash, do it again, if you get the stock, sell a covered call for the next week. It's the best way I've found to really get a feel for the terminology and how it all works."
2021-06-21 19:18:05,wallstreetbets,"Let me try an explanation that definitely works for a dummy (me) focusing on the results of the options:

buying a call - Whoever sold it to me will sell me stock at $XX.XX price, I think it's going to be higher than that so it would benefit me. If it doesn't get that high, I lose what I paid in.

buying a put - Whoever sold it to me will buy stock from me at $XX.XX price, I think it will be lower than that so it would benefit me. If it doesn't get that low, I lose what I paid in."

2021-06-21 08:37:44,wallstreetbets,Let's revisit this afternoon
2021-06-21 12:32:56,wallstreetbets,"I mean it’s not like OP is bag holding a bunch of deep OTM FD’s. The cost is cut off in the screenshot but from what we can see, I think it’s safe to say that OP’s $36 and $37 calls will at least breakeven. His $45 calls have plenty of time and should be ITM if things keep going well for the company.

That just leaves those $40 calls. I agree that theta will start to fuck these if the stock doesn’t make a solid move back above $40 soon. Most analysts have a target price of $44-46 so it’s not like these options are completely retarded. However, if the price is still hovering around $40 next week, prob better to reposition."

2021-06-21 08:49:12,wallstreetbets,This comment will be the best one I read all week. I wish I had more hands so I could give this more then 2 thumbs up.

2021-06-21 16:33:55,wallstreetbets,more than last week since its so cheap
2021-06-21 13:42:53,wallstreetbets,We are going to have 300% ownership of Game Stop if this keeps up.

2021-06-21 12:06:22,wallstreetbets,why is it going down tho? Any experience peep to lend a reason for today?

2021-06-21 08:50:01,wallstreetbets,I was referring to the institutions selling off their shares slowly which often happens after good news about a company when the stock is already up.

2021-06-21 14:44:22,wallstreetbets,I honestly don't get it. Would you mind explaining it to me?
2021-06-21 09:44:22,wallstreetbets,He’s walking away a multimillion after a fuck off performance. Good riddance Boomer George.
2021-06-21 15:22:44,wallstreetbets,3000%
2021-06-21 16:50:48,wallstreetbets,"So this implies bots specifically avoid spamming GME comments, which is another confirmation bias for us haha"
2021-06-21 09:55:12,wallstreetbets,"This was only ever possible in the most optimised scenario where the ""Free market"" is actually *free*.

Don't realistically expect that. By no means am I saying reject the math and the law. The math checks out. The laws check out.

I'm saying don't have faith in the future. That shit crazy and can do anything you don't expect."
2021-06-21 13:02:06,wallstreetbets,It’s an easy answer. Manipulation 🤷🏽‍♂️
2021-06-21 13:57:34,wallstreetbets,Anytime we recieve good news she tanks. Obvious strings being pulled is obvious.
2021-06-21 13:16:51,wallstreetbets,Because news
2021-06-21 09:56:06,wallstreetbets,There are more gme holders in wsb than there are in the other subreddit. It's just the loudest and most obnoxious are over there.
2021-06-21 14:49:12,wallstreetbets,"""Dick"" is a shortened form of ""Richard."" The expression ""...for short"" indicates that something is a shortened form. ""Furshort"" is a pun on this."
2021-06-21 10:46:09,wallstreetbets,He stopped Jim Bell from killing the company back in 2020 and authorized the buy back of shares after the letter from Michael Burry. He did alright.
2021-06-21 11:17:43,wallstreetbets,Honestly I don't think he did too badly.  CFO was pretty clearly planted to drive it into the ground and he at least kept that from happening.
2021-06-21 16:41:18,wallstreetbets,He drove them buying back the shares saving themselves from Short attack bankruptcy... and he also began the initiative to close down unpforitable stores. How is that a bad performance
2021-06-21 16:53:21,wallstreetbets,"Right? Lol, I am waiting for the coming days where pro-GME sentiment is blasted in obnoxious ways across other subreddits in a way to make the various GME-centric subs look like they are brigading in an effort to get them taken down though"

2021-06-21 16:25:48,wallstreetbets,Wow. You took the time to explain. Hail to you!!!
2021-06-21 19:24:10,wallstreetbets,Only in this subreddit would that explanation be necessary.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)
2021-06-21 14:54:47,wallstreetbets,"Wtf? Dick is a short form for Richard?? How???
Anyways thanks for the explanation!"
2021-06-21 13:50:34,wallstreetbets,"George was hired in April 2019 and Jim “Snake Dick” Bell was hired June 2019. George would have approved him as a member of the board. George did help with damage control from his snake CFO. So considered alright then, yeah. Either way, good riddance."
2021-06-21 13:42:45,wallstreetbets,"I don’t disagree that George wasn’t all bad. However, 🐍 CFO joined after Boomer George. Sherman was hired in April 2019 and 🐍 CFO was hired in June 2019. George and the board would have appointed him. So there would have been other bad actors on the board as well. Was George the one who wanted Bell? Probably not, but he also would have been at the helm of a company going straight into the dirt if not for RC. RC is the real MVP."
2021-06-21 18:25:35,wallstreetbets,"He slowed the death spiral, but he wasn’t gonna save GME. Closing stores is the age old playbook. Without RC the company becomes the next Toys R Us, Sears, Borders Books… RC directly addressed these issues in his shareholder letter while crediting GS with poor performing store closures. That’s true, but ultimately it doesn’t matter. Sherman’s legacy isn’t for us to decide. Where he goes next will be telling. 

I’m here all in because of RC, not Sherman. He did his part so what, he got paid well. RC deserves more credit if that’s even possible. No way Sherman walks away with that loot without him."
2021-06-21 16:58:06,wallstreetbets,"002 effective on Wednesday, T+21 FTDs and ATM share offering completion likely this week. Really don’t care about fud at this point lol"

2021-06-21 15:46:24,wallstreetbets,Didn't know that. Thank you man!

The movie is 'Real Steel' (2011)

The song is Eminem's 'Till I collapse'

I added missing subtitles to the original clip ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQ5CYE1VZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQ5CYE1VZw)), I want to give credit to its author

This's my first meme so not everything may be perfect

Did not know there are restrictions in titles

GME, BB, AMC are OG trinity that's why these are starring

2021-06-21 09:15:40,wallstreetbets,Ag is the Real Money
2021-06-21 14:40:43,wallstreetbets,"As you can see the bull is made of soft meat flesh, but the BB robot is made of solid steel, in real life BB wins everytime. Buy more, cunts"
2021-06-21 08:13:31,wallstreetbets,YESSSS THIS. the orginal OG’s . Everything else is FUD IMO

2021-06-21 09:15:27,wallstreetbets,Let’s start banning every post that continues to mention “squeeze”
2021-06-21 13:53:20,wallstreetbets,Bb isn’t like the others. It’s not being squeezed. It’s just dumping
2021-06-21 15:51:22,wallstreetbets,BB? That's a joke right? 🤣 good one
2021-06-21 09:45:14,wallstreetbets,Sold my AMC just in time its heading down

2021-06-21 09:02:00,wallstreetbets,Why CLOV is not there?
2021-06-21 11:01:15,wallstreetbets,"I no longer put AM for morning, its now and forever AMC! 11:00AMC EST"
2021-06-21 18:32:21,wallstreetbets,"AMC ,GME, BB are the only real squeeze that count. Don’t get distracted by any of the other fake squeeze being promoted on WSB."
2021-06-21 09:43:38,wallstreetbets,BB hype is fake
2021-06-21 11:09:40,wallstreetbets,Short interest on AMC is only 13%. No squeeze there
2021-06-21 11:40:07,wallstreetbets,"AMC being Noisy Boy fits incredibly well, especially given how overhyped it was before ultimately faltering."
2021-06-21 06:43:44,wallstreetbets,stop distracting us from CLOV

2021-06-21 08:04:00,wallstreetbets,Post is not old enough. Usually I think after 2 hours you can see votes.
2021-06-21 08:58:55,wallstreetbets,Mods are huge cucks! Any mention of GME will generally get you downvoted to oblivion by bots

2021-06-21 12:19:17,wallstreetbets,Brother if you bought AMC at $9.50 you are the opposite of a bagholder. That term is for people who are OTM. You have a 500% ROI if you sell. You are a theoretical money holder.
2021-06-21 15:03:19,wallstreetbets,🙌🏾💎
2021-06-21 12:20:16,wallstreetbets,"But BB has fundamentals and a future, why would you short a dirt cheap stock with a future?"

2021-06-21 12:31:08,wallstreetbets,Hahahahaha downvoted for telling the truth.
2021-06-21 08:35:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah just don't understand how it's being included with GME and AMC. Not the same
2021-06-21 13:48:12,wallstreetbets,"I've been following bb since the dotcom boom lol. It has solid fundamentals, GREAT patent portfolio but it's been boring AF for years now and there's nothing gonna change. It's a nice long term old in a normal person's portfolio but not even WSB will bring it's sexeh back. I'll be glad if autists prove me wrong on more than a one-day bump, but this is what it is."
2021-06-21 10:09:49,wallstreetbets,A whole 9%?!?! Much wow. Such growth. S&P earnings up 50% and you're gonna hitch a ride on 9%?

2021-06-21 14:38:15,wallstreetbets,I’m only with BB bc it’s my first ever call and AMC and GME are wayyy too damn expensive for me
2021-06-21 12:26:43,wallstreetbets,It's only being looped in because OP owns BB and he's trying to pump it lol

# How in 1930 Wyckoff Described What's Happening Today

[Richard D. Wyckoff](https://preview.redd.it/r0dndnl3zk671.jpg?width=324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66b39741d9950f15d90c73b5b49e384104492e03)

**Who Is Wyckoff?**

>*Richard Demille Wyckoff (1873–1934) was an early 20th-century pioneer in the technical approach to studying the stock market. He is considered one of the five “titans” of technical analysis, along with Dow, Gann, Elliott and Merrill. At age 15, he took a job as a stock runner for a New York brokerage. Afterwards, while still in his 20s, he became the head of his own firm. He also founded and, for nearly two decades wrote, and edited The Magazine of Wall Street, which, at one point, had more than 200,000 subscribers. Wyckoff was an avid student of the markets, as well as an active tape reader and trader. He observed the market activities and campaigns of the legendary stock operators of his time, including JP Morgan and Jesse Livermore. From his observations and interviews with those big-time traders, Wyckoff codified the best practices of Livermore and others into laws, principles and techniques of trading methodology, money management and mental discipline.*

**Why I'm Including it in This Post?**

>*From his position, Mr. Wyckoff observed numerous retail investors being repeatedly fleeced. Consequently, he dedicated himself to instructing the public about “the real rules of the game” as played by the large interests, or “smart money.” In the 1930s, he founded a school which would later become the Stock Market Institute. The school's central offering was a course that integrated the concepts that Wyckoff had learned about how to identify large operators' accumulation and distribution of stock with how to take positions in harmony with these big players. His time-tested insights are as valid today as they were when first articulated.*

Basically in 1930 near his death he started writing books about what he learned during his life to make retail investors understand the market better, illustrating all his knowledge in a reddit post is impossible and today I want to focus only on market manipulation.

# Who Is The ""Composite Man""

>*“…all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man’s operations. Let us call him the Composite Man, who, in theory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it; and to your great profit if you do understand it.”* (*The Richard D. Wyckoff Course in Stock Market Science and Technique*, section 9, p. 1-2) 

Based on his years of observations of the market activities of large operators, Wyckoff taught that:

1. The Composite Man carefully plans, executes and concludes his campaigns.
2. The Composite Man attracts the public to buy a stock in which he has already accumulated a sizeable line of shares by making many transactions involving a large number of shares, in effect advertising his stock by creating the appearance of a “broad market.”
3. One must study individual stock charts with the purpose of judging the behavior of the stock and the motives of those large operators who dominate it.
4. With study and practice, one can acquire the ability to interpret the motives behind the action that a chart portrays. Wyckoff and his associates believed that if one could understand the market behavior of the Composite Man, one could identify many trading and investment opportunities early enough to profit from them.

# The Importance Of Liquidity

Let's say a stock is sitting at $20 but a ""Pro"" thinks it could make it to be worth $40, large investors may not accumulate a high number of shares at one time as this would cause a sudden change in the stock price. Instead they will take advantage of weak market sessions to slowly accumulate their target number of shares.

Once they have accumulated their target number of shares and want to sell for the same reason as before, they can't unload everything at once or they would affect the market again.

But how can they unload their shares at maximum profit? Through manipulation. They can do it by making that shady little company look like it will become the next Apple, and they manipulate the newspapers to do it.

[FOMO](https://preview.redd.it/4ikowb6j5l671.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=949686266619575afa3c565a32df772ddf11aa1b)

They create FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) in small retail investors, and that brings a lot of volume on that stock. If you thought the goal of the market makers was to inflate the stock price through this type of manipulation, you're wrong.

Consider an institutional investor who bought 5,000,000 shares of a company at $1 that now sits at $3, has a lot more information about that company than you do, and knows that company is bad and likely to release bad news in a few weeks. Everyone knows that in order to sell something you need a buyer willing to pay the price you're offering, so how can he dump 5,000,000 shares of stock unnoticed in a few weeks and get away with it? He's going to start making people think that this company has something very big coming up, that he's going to make a 500% move and you're going to miss out. People start ""FOMOing"" and bring huge volume to that stock, with more people willing to buy he can sell all his shares faster and get out of that stock as quickly as possible. He doesn't care if the stock makes a 100% move in the meantime because of this sudden interest, he only cares about getting out. And guess what, later on, when the bad news is released, the market maker will be the winner while a lot of retail investors have been burned.

&#x200B;

>“You have often noticed that a stock will sell at the highest price for many months on the very day when a stock dividend, or some very bullish news, appears in print. **This is not mere accident.**  
>  
>**The whole move is manufactured.** Its purpose is to make money for inside interests — those who are operating in the stock in a large way. And this can only be done by fooling the public, or by inducing the public to fool themselves.”

This was written in 1930! 90 Years ago! Buy the rumour sell the news.

# Market Manipulation 5.0 And How You Are Helping To Make It Happen

After what happened with meme stocks in the last month a lot of people started looking to invest, without any knowledge and trusting the advice of people on reddit and other social media many found themselves losing a lot of money on some stocks that look very good.

&#x200B;

What is happening now is that some big institutions probably pay influencers and use bots to make some companies look much better than they really are. The problem is that many people trust other DDs (Due Diligence) too much and end up thinking that a stock is really good and they buy some stocks. What's worse is that a lot of times people who have invested in some companies end up becoming like extremists and start ""propagandizing"" when they see that they are losing money. 

&#x200B;

Basically what is happening is that I (and probably you too) am noticing a lot of people or groups who buy for example a stock at $10 because it is full of potential (pumped by a market maker) and when they find themselves owning it with a 30% loss they start trying to convince people that it will soon go up. This is ethically wrong and to avoid getting caught in this you should ALWAYS do your research. If you don't know how to research ask the person who posted the sources.

# How Can You Stop Losing Money On Bad Stocks

* Don't trust anyone, do your own research
* Ask for sources from those who publish DDs
* Stay away from stocks that come from scam countries
* If you see a lot of people saying a stock is going to go up stay away
* Don't buy a stock that people say will CERTAINLY have good news coming (example: ""stock X will get FDA approval next week"" usually won't and will fall into oblivion)
* If you're losing on a stock, stop saying on social media that it will surely rebound
* If you buy a stock you MUST stay current on it, you can't just buy and forget about it
* If a stock has a news related to a sector unrelated to it stay away (for example a tourism stock says it will do something in the hot sector of the moment, this is usually done to temporarily pump up the stock)
* SELL THE NEWS

2021-06-21 15:41:59,wallstreetbets,"Yup, a buddy of mine is a trader at a large fund and explained it to me like this.

Say they have 100 million units of a stock, they believe the company does have long term potential, but would like to liquidate 50 million units to invest in something else.  Rather than just selling, which would take the price down with it, they will start buying another 10 million units, this suddenly gets other firms and investment outlets interested in the company, because after all, there is a strong long term outlook.  

Then, as soon as it starts getting an artificial pump from their made up hype. They slowly liquidate 60 million of their position (the original 50 plus the 10 they used to start the hype).  By the time people realize what’s happened the stock has shot up 30% and then back to where it was before they put in their initial buy.

Dark Pool trading is making up 70 percent of trading in the stocks that Citadel is shorting. There is no winning against a hedge that can short a company into the ground while their market maker division can simply cover retail purchases from brokers by conducting most of those trades in Dark Pool activity.  It is the loophole that has made them billions and until Dark Pool trading is regulated in a more fair to retail traders manner, we will not be able to compete no matter how many apes pile on…🤷🏻‍♂️"

2021-06-21 13:34:28,wallstreetbets,"I know I’m gonna get downvoted to hell by all of you guys that won’t even read or respond to what I have to say, but here goes.

This post is actually really dumb. That advice section at the end especially. Every point you make contradicts the one before it.

You say to not trade on any news that will affect the industry, or to trade on any expected news that will affect the stock. However, your last major point is SELL THE NEWS. Which one is it? Should I not pay attention to what you call fake pump-and-dump tactics or should I trade on news? You contradict yourself.

Furthermore, if your point is that this “news” is artificial and doesn’t actually pertain to the value of a stock, then why is one of your points at the end that “you MUST stay current” on a stock you have bought, and that “you can’t just buy and forget about it”??? Wouldn’t long-term holding with a disregard to price fluctuations be the best way to counter the artificial mini pump and dumps you are describing?

This is all basic logic, but WSB eats up any bullshit DD that even appears logical.

The stuff traders did in the 20’s is great reading. They truly figured everything out 100 years ago. But it’s not all still happening.

A lot of the tricks that Livermore et al used in their day are illegal and impossible now. The clever scams they ran then are easy for brokerages and exchanges to detect and prevent now. 

It’s still possible to “paint the tape” just to a lesser extent. You can still legally front run (amazingly) by paying for order flow. They would have loved that in the 20’s. Same with some of the HFT tricks."

2021-06-21 09:40:26,wallstreetbets,"Firstly, all the advice you give is good and decent. However, this idea that institutional investors have more information than you is wrong, there's a reason insider trading is a crime and as much as we like to hate on institutions, MM and the SEC they take that shit pretty seriously.   


However, that doesn't mean that these guys don't want to encourage shady fake news etc. that's why doing your own DD is super important as you pointed out. Calling it market manipulation is a bit misleading (even by your definition, they're not actually able to move the price, they can merely spread news about price sentiment. It requires you as an investor to fall for it). It's more akin to propaganda, and if you fall for it, that's on you."
2021-06-21 07:40:25,wallstreetbets,"So, I've just done some reading, and I used my current security interest (CLNE). If Wyckoff is correct, the volume of trades in CLNE being over 100M, with the price barely moving, indicates that the security is in the Accumulation phase by institutions and large interests. If this is the case, I feel pretty good about it as I'm finally in on the ground floor of their game. Now I just need to time my sell-off with them and not fall for the shake-out."

It's a great tool to observe these things due to the constant value proposition that crypt0 offers (unlike stocks where things about the company can easily change ruining even the best laid plans of the market). 

When you have an asset that's weakly regulated and with an unchanging value proposition, you quickly get the same old manipulation patterns that've been used for hundreds of years now. It's very informative on how the whales play these games and very applicable to stocks as well."

But my concern was that ""walkstreet""/""the man"" would of course figure out how to manipulate the influx of changes- and then these folks investing without liquidity could lose their money.

As the prices go up, he is going short, so when prices reach their zenith, he starts covering his short positions. As prices are dropping, he may also be building his longs at the same time. So when negative news comes out, it is to us a bearish indication, but to the MM it's bullish. However, if the MM just cares about exiting a stock, then he won't be building longs on the way down, so that's when a stock will enter these dreary prices and stay there, likely trapping retailers who weren't able to exit."

Serious question:

Why all the hate directed The Fool? I'm not a shill, subscribe or not, your call...couldn't care less.

I've paid for some of their services off an on over the last ten years. Let's assume I paid $300 annually for every one of those years (I haven't, but mathing isn't my best quality, so let's go with easier); that'd be a total of $3K, right (you know, math...).

Seven of my top ten holdings are from Fool recommendations (this is truth). The P/L of those is about $80.5K. Also, I rung the register and took half my profits on two of them to the tune of about an additional $40K (CMG and MKTX).

So, on a $3K investment, I've made $120K? That's just from

Again, I'm not a shill, this is not an advocation for these services...just trying to understand the hate. I've stopped my subs over the years and restarted them. Been watching WSB for a month or so and will again consider letting my sub lapse.

If I can find a place where recommendations are solid, I can get some research that I can validate with my own research, then I head that direction. I should mention, I'm usually looooonnnng in my positions.

2021-06-21 13:18:51,wallstreetbets,"I bought a little before the spike. No interest in selling really.  


There's a lot of upside in the US healthcare industry with our aging population. It might not moon to $300 a share, but I could see it getting to $30.00 at some point in the not too distant future.  


The cool thing about a stock becoming a WSB favorite is you have that AMC or GME potential in the mix now (albeit rare), but if the company is otherwise interesting and you don't FOMO buy after a big spike you still have the option to just hold and have a decent mid-long term payoff."
2021-06-21 13:07:18,wallstreetbets,Lol said that since day 1. Man people got fucking pissed too. I made a decent chunk of change off the puts though.

Not to mention that new data shows that the shares being shorted are Class B which means that over 90% of the float is being shorted.

When those shares get covered, everyone calling CLOV and pump and dump is going to put their foot in their mouth."
2021-06-21 14:42:03,wallstreetbets,"We are the ones who pumped CLOV. We had a whole megathread just for CLOV and WISH. And I got ripped up for saying CLOV was bs and a bad investment.

2021-06-21 10:21:47,wallstreetbets,"That doesnt mean that it's a bad stock, fortunately. Institutions are still invested in CLOV, like Vanguard. Retail investors make a large chunk now. Some of the people who benefited off that spike are retail investors who have pull in wsb publicity, some made a million on CLOV. And now it has a high short interest, so media wants people to sell and not buy/hold.

Imo it's a good business and will naturally grow as it has been, especially with their steady investors. Sure you can make money in the short term with exposure and press, or you can possibly make some normally with months or years. We shall see, what do I know?"
2021-06-21 12:27:12,wallstreetbets,"Agree. CLOV was a bait. Promoted badly by shills, ignored by mods, and gobbled by noobs."

God knows what will happen tomorrow, but taking it off my watch list now"
2021-06-21 17:13:16,wallstreetbets,"Here in lies the whole problem. If a stock goes up 20% that’s not a big deal doesn’t get much attention. I stock goes up 100% people notice. So now the question is , Did composite man set up for a 100% gain and exit or is it a higher number? This is where the line between getting in early and FOMO are very blurry."

It’s not hard to see they are just using Reddit to make money off of retail at this point. I don’t ever recall so many stocks being pumped all in the same week, seemed to be a new “short squeeze” every single day. If you’ve been paying attention you’ll see it’s the exact same stocks that had been mentioned on here since Jan with no new news. 

It’s naive to think the hedge funds aren’t using Reddit to their advantage. Always make your plays with that in mind and get out quick once you see profit."
2021-06-21 11:45:07,wallstreetbets,shhh dont tell the other retards how to make money
2021-06-21 14:17:56,wallstreetbets,Same here. And I was buying the puts just as fast as I was pumping it up 😂
2021-06-21 13:38:39,wallstreetbets,I did the same. I bought 100 shares and sold it 2 days later for a profit.

2021-06-21 11:17:45,wallstreetbets,"The issue isn’t the level or quality of education. It’s the application of the knowledge.

It seems this was more to scare then to actually inform. Big market players are nothing new. Only thing I agree with in this post is doing your own research and to not trust the media like some biblical text.

\-- If you’re losing on a stock, stop saying on social media that it will surely rebound --

Nothing wrong with having hope for a stock and believing it can do well in the future. Most long term investments caught early pay off nicely. This whole post is weird...

2021-06-21 10:18:38,wallstreetbets,"Hell yea, thats also not including the fact shorts never covered and the NYSE president said ~60-70% of meme stock trades have been conducted in dark pools, meaning the true value is masked."
2021-06-21 12:44:40,wallstreetbets,"I'm also learning how to not get burned, so the whole Wyckoff method is new to me as of today. Your theory sounds plausible, but from what I'm reading re: the method, this type of market action can also likely be the MMs testing the supply/demand and shaking off small investors in order for themselves to buy up the stock cheap. MMs can't move the stock in such large numbers all at once or else they'd drive the price into oblivion in a single day. They have to do it gradually. They're basically ninjas."

2021-06-21 14:19:04,wallstreetbets,Thanks :)
2021-06-21 13:01:56,wallstreetbets,"You're getting downvoted for telling the truth.  Retail loses money because of two reasons.  First, FOMO.  People chase the fucking ladder.  Second?  Because they don't know when to get out.  There was no short squeeze with CLOV.  There was barely even a gamma opportunity based on the call chain.  People fall for the hype, chase the ladder, then end up holding the bag because they're unwilling to take their 120% profits and walk away to fight another day, WITH MORE MONEY."
2021-06-21 14:00:14,wallstreetbets,"This is some of the best advice I’ve seen on here (not that you’re the first to say it). People are inherently emotional, and it’s easy to get swept up in the hype of you don’t have a plan and the gall to stick to it."
2021-06-21 18:12:20,wallstreetbets,"Except that they aren't ""worth those prices"" to me, a failing bankrupt movie chain at $10 is absurd to me, nor am I an investor interested in chamath-pumped SPACs, so these are all ""risky"" plays to me"
2021-06-21 13:10:42,wallstreetbets,AMC with its high short interest is still a safe bet.
2021-06-21 16:03:08,wallstreetbets,"Okay guy. I should have said popularized.

I fixed it for you."
2021-06-21 18:39:23,wallstreetbets,So do you think they invented a high interest rate to trick the community?

2021-06-21 16:05:59,wallstreetbets,....so you're full of it then.
2021-06-21 09:11:06,wallstreetbets,"No problem. With the right moves, you will regain. Just take it slow, and never invest more than you can stand to lose. When I started investing, I saved money from what I call nonsense wasting. Do I need to eat lunch out everyday? Cigarettes, some game or movie I didn't need, and so on. It was the perfect mixture to save, invest, and eventually capitalize. Been investing 10 years, and it's worked out well."
2021-06-21 17:49:45,wallstreetbets,Excremento!
2021-06-21 16:15:42,wallstreetbets,I don't trust what you just said.

2021-06-21 17:47:14,wallstreetbets,I read the same thing too. I honestly respect them and their creativity. It's funny how you hear shit as an adult that you heard as a kid and then find the deeper meaning. Timeless classic righ there. .

2021-06-21 14:14:00,wallstreetbets,"“unwilling to take their 120% profits and walk away”

Yup. Small wins is what it’s about…with few exceptions."
2021-06-21 13:45:58,wallstreetbets,People also lose money by buying high into stocks with no research. I dont think buying gme and AMC at these prices is a bad idea if you have conviction and buy dips and are willing to hold. Fomo tards who want to get rich quick see a 15% dip for the first time and sellout at a loss
2021-06-21 17:36:55,wallstreetbets,Agreed and they’re also the type to take their profits if they’re lucky enough to more and more risky plays so they can keep doubling their money in a few months time. It isn’t sustainable and will result in losses at some point that will crater their portfolio
2021-06-21 19:04:05,wallstreetbets,"Out of personal curiosity, how much (as a %) would you say is worth aiming for in a stock? Ideally for someone who is newer and with, say, less than 1k? 

Obviously this is subjective and will change a bit based on how aggressively someone invests or has time to, but for the general newbie, what advice would you give?"
2021-06-21 15:35:33,wallstreetbets,"I've been getting better about this but still bite too often. 

I'll follow my strategy and get a solid 4 or 5 percent every month or two. Very solid returns. Been reproducable every time I've stuck to it. 

Then I get a little over zealous and buy in to something beyond the hype and lost most of my profit. 

I just gotta stick to my plan and not waffle at all."
2021-06-21 14:24:20,wallstreetbets,"you could be right, or it could be what they want you to think while they slowly unload their shares at large profits."
2021-06-21 10:16:16,wallstreetbets,Thats because you have the volume too quiet so you can't hear the dialog
2021-06-21 10:37:18,wallstreetbets,They aren’t that hard to follow. When I take mine out for a walk they hardly move.
2021-06-21 10:18:07,wallstreetbets,Citadel will list it to try and get some money back from us

2021-06-21 16:02:55,wallstreetbets,"The short interest just isn't there anymore. The simple fact is back in January over 100% of the float was shorted, but that isn't the case anymore and just stuffing your fingers in your ears and going ""la la la"" won't make it come back either."

2021-06-21 14:40:27,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it’s definitely not what this sub is about. This sub is about retards being degenerate gamblers, yoloing their life savings into calls then calling people like us boomers because our strategies aren’t all or nothing."
2021-06-21 18:40:52,wallstreetbets,"Financial planner fam member states that investing is long, slow and boring but you come out on to at the end.  I say, that's what my 401k is for. YOLO!!"
2021-06-21 14:19:22,wallstreetbets,What type of research would lead you to buy amc at these prices 😂
2021-06-21 17:46:42,wallstreetbets,"Personally I believe the ape community is strong. Even at the 50-60$ range the worst that happens is we trade sideways. I'm obviously biased too because I got in way early and it would have to tank severely for me to even come close to seeing red. I still think even at these prices AMC could be a good investment if you have some yolo money. But there is a chance we stay trading sideways until buying pressure fades away and we drop back down. Or we could get a gamma squeeze. Either way, I'm in for the ride. I think there is a legitimate case here for GME and AMC. It's not just memes anymore"
2021-06-21 10:38:54,wallstreetbets,"That's right, so turn it to 11"
2021-06-21 11:07:02,wallstreetbets,"Knowing the difference between funny and offensive was my suggestion. Flaunting that you were raised by a pack of wolves and descend from inbred gene-stock can be shared appropriately in many different venues.  

Also. It’s “ you’re”"
2021-06-21 16:05:47,wallstreetbets,"All that’s left in here is hope and lost college funds. I don’t mind tho, the ups and downs of this gme train has made me lots of money in the end:) diamond hands are for bagholders, unfortunately."
2021-06-21 17:33:12,wallstreetbets,"You: ""This is quite common""

Also you: ""I don't have the time to spend hunting those down!""

Forgive me for not exactly believing you, given that you're behaving exactly like a man who's bullshitting."

2021-06-21 16:27:16,wallstreetbets,"I thought this sub was about people saving up $500 from giving blow jobs behind a dumpster at Wendy's, buying FDs on a meme stock, making 100 grand in 2 weeks, then calling it their life savings as they yolo it all into the next meme stock.

1 in 10000 escapes the poverty trap, while everyone else keeps giving blow jobs until they learn the way and then finally get lucky. 

Or is that just a sales pitch from the theta gang selling massively over priced options?"
2021-06-21 14:23:30,wallstreetbets,The prospects of a short squeeze coming
2021-06-21 15:22:35,wallstreetbets,For one theres a disgusting ammount of calls set to expire and run in the money very very soon. Millions of shares bought in delta hedging puts a gamma squeeze on the table. But I guess we'll just have to wait and see
2021-06-21 12:15:19,wallstreetbets,But I can't count to 11 :'(
2021-06-21 16:08:01,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands are 100% for bagholders. You can absolutely make money riding the GME and AMC trains but you gotta know when to get on and when to get off.
2021-06-21 17:38:39,wallstreetbets,"It’s all good, I’m not here to convince you. The evidence is there, feel free to conduct your own research that goes back 5 months now."
2021-06-21 15:08:05,wallstreetbets,"That’s the only answer tbh. It’s trading twice it’s all time high. Yes they paid their debt and yes they raised captial, but they’ve missed earnings for like 5 quarters and will likely miss again.  No one buying AMC over $20 was doing it because of fundamentals, they’re doing it because they think hedge funds still have short positions that need to cover."
2021-06-21 17:55:42,wallstreetbets,Did you notice the 100k+ contracts that didn’t print at the 60 strike last Friday. How much money was wasted on calls instead of buying shares.
2021-06-21 16:04:52,wallstreetbets,Take your shoes off.
2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,BABA ~11k calls JAN yolo 
2021-06-21 08:46:53,wallstreetbets,"BABA is certainly from fundamental numbers, in current market, undervalued significantly. Politics have really not done good for the price of BABA. I think your risk to reward is very good, although my biggest worry would be overall market selloff in H2. 

What is your PT for Jan 2022 OP?"
2021-06-21 08:24:45,wallstreetbets,Are you concerned about US-CHNA relations fucking this up?
2021-06-21 11:52:09,wallstreetbets,I am also in Baba. Not selling
2021-06-21 12:41:20,wallstreetbets,"In this with you, around 150k in options and stocks.  1 ER away from going back to 300."
2021-06-21 09:10:54,wallstreetbets,Nice!! Glad to see some people with real balls again on here ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)
2021-06-21 13:05:34,wallstreetbets,"I agree 100%, but go with a higher strike price. Like $260 or $270. Much better payoff if you and I are correct."
2021-06-21 18:13:01,wallstreetbets,"Wow, and with a reasonable strike price too!"
2021-06-21 06:24:53,wallstreetbets,BABA GOOO $300
2021-06-21 08:58:41,wallstreetbets,"If you're familiar with the fundamentals than you must know about good ratios in this deal.
Atm i think 260-300 in jan is fair enough, But *any* good news regarding us/china relations or baba specific little catalyst can send the price to 250 in matter of couple days time.
Btw looking at p/e / fp/e + p/b alone this company is a steal."
2021-06-21 08:45:46,wallstreetbets,"Nah man, i won't write a DD about it but BABA is legit company which makes a lot of money through various sources. Its at ridiculous price imo and i don't think the china goverment or the us/china relations can fk it up more than right now.
Let's say I'm wrong and baba goes below 200, I'm dropping another 10k.💰"
2021-06-21 11:25:55,wallstreetbets,I think Biden is overextended; he cant start a trade war with China when domestics are in shambles.
2021-06-21 12:14:33,wallstreetbets,just bought more 2023 leaps when diped this morning.
2021-06-21 15:32:33,wallstreetbets,"got some on really far OTM 2023 leaps this morning. right now i hold other plays that i really like, ill buy more OTM for like 6-12months in a couple days, waiting to see what will happen untill then."
2021-06-21 06:41:04,wallstreetbets,Easy
2021-06-21 09:22:27,wallstreetbets,"Yep, i agree. I also own some BABA shares and recently doubled down at current price. Good luck!"
2021-06-21 08:53:27,wallstreetbets,Best of luck. JD fukt me this year so I abandoned Chinese stocks for now.

2021-06-21 10:11:22,wallstreetbets,"I'm so confused about BB in terms of its competition...

> Leadership position
> Widespread adoption of its software
> Revenue of over $1 bn.
> Reorganising successfully.
> Mostly profitable in the past 5 years except for year of reorganisation

Market cap of 6-7 bn.

Others cybersecurity companies with lower revenue and shitty tech

24 bn!

Analysts

BB is overvalued.

Like, what?"

I see green movement in the 420 stocks which can only mean that they are trying to pump and dump them again for meeting the losses from squeezing, meaning BB, CLNE, AMC are actually gonna be bleeding hedges and they know it, so they are biding their time, doing what they do, but good too see most people seeing through this and using these dips to double down on the securities. 
Tomorrow is gonna be pretty rough and a classic shakedown, hold strong, Wednesday and Thursday are days of the BULLS.

2021-06-21 11:30:55,wallstreetbets,"On CNBC, Trey said he thinks AMC will go higher because of 3 factors:

1. FOMO, as people are attracted to rising price trends,
2. Gamma squeeze as MM need to delta hedge shares for newly ITM calls, and
3. Shorts will need to cover if the price goes higher.

This literally means the price will go higher if the price goes higher, i.e. momentum.

All three factors die when the price goes lower."

Smart traders bought it as soon as they smelled you getting hard ons and sold it an hour later and now they gone away somewhere else. So SPY is stuck till you sell off this afternoon to not loose your 5 bucks. Or sit on it like boomers.

Put it this way:  If you haven't been buying BB at ""a discount"" you could get it far cheaper today.  If you bought Smith & Wesson a few days ago you'd already doubled your money.

2021-06-21 11:29:33,wallstreetbets,Sold high on Friday and bought at the dip today. Happy CLNE holder here moving forward.
2021-06-21 11:30:36,wallstreetbets,I ain't selling for a loss. The company actually makes sense. The median valuation is [$20 per share](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=CLNE).
2021-06-21 14:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Can't raise my hand, bags too heavy"
2021-06-21 14:12:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I’m still a bag holder. Come to get us 😄🌝"
2021-06-21 14:10:37,wallstreetbets,I’m holding 👜s no doubt.
2021-06-21 10:28:42,wallstreetbets,"I see lot of people downvote but they didn’t get my context. The truth is BB is a good company and is trying different innovations after a huge downfall. On the other hand, AMC has crossed $70 once. So why can’t we take BB to at-least $30 and make BB again the old school tech king 👑 BB to the mooon."
2021-06-21 11:15:49,wallstreetbets,Wait I thought I was doing the sandwiches and you would do the fuel

2021-06-21 13:30:34,wallstreetbets,The uncharted lands of BB
2021-06-21 13:30:43,wallstreetbets,It needs to get to green from last week when trading at $15
2021-06-21 16:04:49,wallstreetbets,Sell some CC if you have over 100 shares and start bringing in some weekly profit
2021-06-21 16:04:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I sold half and bought more GME like a fuckin boss and lit up on some TRCH. That Dividend about to pay out and you know what they say. ""Ten bucks is ten bucks"""
2021-06-21 10:06:26,wallstreetbets,"My guess is since it missed the gamma squeeze Friday, folks with short attention spans are dumping it for the top-discussed memestocks of the day. Still a solid play, and Im still in it, but I think most people here are lookin to become millionaires in a day, not in a few weeks."
2021-06-21 13:51:24,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, suddenly these bags feel a bit lighter."
2021-06-21 19:03:20,wallstreetbets,"on FIDELITY today;

GME 16,933 BUY orders, **3340** SELL orders"
2021-06-21 16:50:30,wallstreetbets,Don't say that about my piece of shit.
2021-06-21 16:51:36,wallstreetbets,Super heavy bags. Sitting right next to Wendy’s they both look like trash… I’d love to dump them but I’m down almost 400- between the two
2021-06-21 18:20:31,wallstreetbets,It's been a piece of shit for like two weeks now and retards keep buying it because it's cheap.
2021-06-21 17:15:41,wallstreetbets,It has been for a while. 😂
2021-06-21 11:02:12,wallstreetbets,You just gave it to us.. i fucking love when this happens.
2021-06-21 12:00:40,wallstreetbets,"I think too many people got burnt on it. With AMC, and GME getting all the attention, I just don’t think people trust jumping back in. Me being a retarded ape, I’m just gonna keep buying the dips. One day I will make enough money to buy myself a Lambo go cart off all my BB investments"
2021-06-21 08:18:53,wallstreetbets,"BB most definitely, BB has a future."
2021-06-21 08:18:40,wallstreetbets,Ha! The one that goes up more than a buck

2021-06-21 08:50:22,wallstreetbets,It was a mistake. Mods owned up to it in the other thread
2021-06-21 08:15:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm going full stocks on CLNE, I like the stock."

2021-06-21 13:41:04,wallstreetbets,it's an algorithm based on how often a ticker is mentioned. hence SPY sneaking in today
2021-06-21 09:58:15,wallstreetbets,Lol I'm still holding but wasn't everything supposed to go down on the 18th? What happened?
2021-06-21 12:23:06,wallstreetbets,Because it isn’t worth $30 billion

2021-06-21 15:38:44,wallstreetbets,Lol so delusional. Where did you buy in at? 64? 72?
2021-06-21 13:57:49,wallstreetbets,"The fundamentals of squeezes, lots of shorts they haven’t covered and an absurd resolve from retail investors. Not to mention, everybody and their mom is trying to FUD people out of AMC. That’s called fear, fear from the institutions and big money."
2021-06-21 13:28:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Massive revenue increases from increases in movie ticket and concession sales. The new Bond, the new Top Gun, and the new Fast and Furious haven't been released yet. There should be some massive movie revenues this summer."
2021-06-21 07:22:31,wallstreetbets,Mods all in on SPY confirmed

2021-06-21 16:32:14,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts exactly. If SPY wants to go up like these other stocks, then who am I to complain 🤷"
2021-06-21 11:20:05,wallstreetbets,"What a cunt thing to say

I bought BB on Friday but never touched my AmC shares and won’t sell even a single one even if it takes me to zero"

2021-06-21 14:04:26,wallstreetbets,Don’t gamble money you actually need. Your girl gonna be dissapointed and you will too. Be smart and just take your funda
2021-06-21 10:35:13,wallstreetbets,I mean investing isn’t a group effort and not every play is for a squeeze that’s mostly an irrelevant investing strategy in the real world
2021-06-21 10:43:41,wallstreetbets,"By ""these fuckers"" you mean, each other right? Because you all pretty much own AMC by now. Not sure who else you think you're going to get anything out of..."
2021-06-21 10:29:31,wallstreetbets,"Seeing CLOV and BB annoys me at this point, they keep trying to recreate AMC when AMC isn’t even done, and possibly not even close to being done."

2021-06-21 18:05:30,wallstreetbets,Not really. I’m up a shit load on CLNE. I bought in low and am waiting until I feel it’s time to cash out. You must be on some garbage stocks since you obviously don’t know anything about CLNE
2021-06-21 06:43:53,wallstreetbets,It fucked its share holders and went to Uranus
2021-06-21 08:10:20,wallstreetbets,🤔 not enough brain wrinkles translation required.

2021-06-21 14:56:03,wallstreetbets,"Everyone on WSB is saying that, which means there is a high chance it does the complete opposite. Bad BB earnings = face ripping rally"

2021-06-21 14:15:34,wallstreetbets,Because paperhand newbs getting scared and buying high then selling low. Don’t know that this is a long game. They want to make instant profits. If they would just realize holding and buying shares was the way to win then we could get some movement up
2021-06-21 14:31:12,wallstreetbets,"I mean I came (😈) into WSB when the whole GME thing first started. I occasionally looked at it before, but I didn’t even invest at that age since I was too young. From what I’ve seen, GME and AMC spikes were a great group effort, but nobody WANTS to be apes again and spike a specific stock, so just accept it, move on, and keep posting whichever stock you like 🦍🦍🦍"

2021-06-21 15:43:32,wallstreetbets,People see the potential BB has and believe it’s undervalued? It is also kind of cheap so a lot of people can buy more of it which speaks to some. Not too complicated to understand.

2021-06-21 12:29:34,wallstreetbets,"It was almost guaranteed to hit 54 once it broke below 58 based on recent history, but that level seems to hold well every time so this reversal could be legitimate and it might move back up to the upper 50s again.  

I wasn't watching at the time, but that last bar below 54 looked good as a buy setup, and it's now set a higher high.

Edit: As expected, that 54 level has shown a lot of strength.  AMC now in an uptrend.  Close at 57 or above would be really good."
2021-06-21 13:07:45,wallstreetbets,I previously sold a July 37 ccall. might buy it back 🤔

2021-06-21 08:23:30,wallstreetbets,BB is a long hold. They have great potential in the future and were undervalued a few weeks ago at around $8. BB has IVY coming out before the end of the year and has been also increasing its partnerships on the security side of the business lately

2021-06-21 11:52:24,wallstreetbets,"of course it isn't, but first we must reach $9001."
2021-06-21 11:57:57,wallstreetbets,AMC gonna test 50 easy today if it keeps this up.  Buying opportunity if you can guess the bottom right!
2021-06-21 14:56:13,wallstreetbets,It’s a long play
2021-06-21 14:32:29,wallstreetbets,"AMC hasn’t even reached its potential yet that’s the thing, and obviously they do since CLNE, CLOV, etc etc are pushed down our throats daily."
2021-06-21 15:47:30,wallstreetbets,"Also, there's a lot of people on here who are holding BB bags since feb, so to sum it up:- squeeze potential- stuck money- cheap - genuinely undervalued - real financials, why wouldn't you wanna go after it?"
2021-06-21 16:45:36,wallstreetbets,It's the truth.GME and AMC are the truth the other's which been pushed recently are distraction stocks

2021-06-21 16:03:18,wallstreetbets,"My retarded ass doubled at the peak of 21 when I had average of  9. Now I am stuck with bags. Tried to get rid of the half at loss and buy WKHS, guess what?! Also at the peak. 12.9 is a good price. You will break even today. Be careful on Thursday! People might dump the stocks."
2021-06-21 15:23:35,wallstreetbets,Boss told him to pump WISH again
2021-06-21 14:53:20,wallstreetbets,Lol had to let that shit go and jump on with the crowd.
2021-06-21 14:55:59,wallstreetbets,"I can tel you one thing though. I’ve been watching all of this BB talk and ain’t seen shit yet Irvin bought into that shit at one time just to get fucked.
Only the people that bought in when the stock was down keep trying to pump it. 
It’s already been pumped and dumped and now the people that are holding onto the bags keep trying to promote it"
2021-06-21 15:37:34,wallstreetbets,"Dumber together.  I like to buy very late in the date, and then capture the pre-market spike in the first 30-60 minutes of the day"

2021-06-21 17:10:42,wallstreetbets,It was $8 less than a month ago. You FOMO after a huge run up that’s going to end bad for you most of the time.
2021-06-21 12:09:10,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty chill, 215k cash with only a 40k short. It only costs me $3/day interest for the short borrow, since my annual interest rate is only 2.9%"
2021-06-21 17:32:36,wallstreetbets,Idk if i would say pump and dump. The main goal behind gme and amc is a massive squeeze and helping the companies. Now im sure certain people HFs included join in when theres a breakout and pump it higher but thats not the main goal
2021-06-21 17:35:51,wallstreetbets,"I mean even if this were true, which I’m not sure it is, it still doesn’t mean it has a lot of short interest. It’s possible that tech as a whole is doing well, so most companies in tech don’t have a lot of short interest."
2021-06-21 13:35:10,wallstreetbets,"AMC's share price isn't tethered to reality, it's tethered to sentiment and perception. Just like every other stock on the market :)"

2021-06-21 16:53:44,wallstreetbets,"These other stocks aren’t distractions. They are stocks people who don’t give a fuck about GME and AMC invest in. Enough with the cultist conspiracy theories. I held both AMC and GME but knew when to cash out and make my exit.

Edit: I can see by the down votes, you cultists hold too much sentiment because nothing I said was negative. Just a dose of reality. I made money and knew when to pull the plug"
2021-06-21 18:49:37,wallstreetbets,"Hahahahha if only you knew reality shit for brains. Good luck on your stock bashing job fuckwit, hear it pays real well."

They cancel each other out"
2021-06-21 09:23:06,wallstreetbets,"No shit Sherlock. If the squeeze fails, AMC goes to the depths of hell, while BB has less chance of completely dying, so less downside. It also has a potential squeeze catalyst if they randomly announce some bullish news with their qnx shit. I'm all in AMC, but that's the reasoning behind buying BB. Also, cause it's cheaper ( not that it matters with fractional shares, but it makes a difference to perception )"
2021-06-21 16:57:20,wallstreetbets,Is it profane? Embed it with special characters split through your next reply.
2021-06-21 08:25:29,wallstreetbets,BB was $8 less than a month ago. Also I’m in BB for the long hold. Believe they have a lot of potential in the next year or two +.
2021-06-21 16:19:49,wallstreetbets,These guys will not trick me. I been burned too many times recently.. I have learned. GME and partly AMC are the way to go

2021-06-21 12:21:41,wallstreetbets,Says you lol you’re dealing with a stock that has potential to fucking rocketship. It was at 12 a month ago. You don’t understand how dedicated people are to holding this stock
2021-06-21 12:24:04,wallstreetbets,Also AMC is about 60% above its ATH. GME is at like 250% above ATH. If you think this squeeze is over I wouldn’t bank on it
2021-06-21 12:16:59,wallstreetbets,If they don’t margin call you prior to that

But I know quite a lot about AMC. I listened to all the hype videos giving their reasons for why AMC will go higher, ex. I watch Trey's Trades and Matt Kohr's videos as soon as they come out.

As soon as you see a persistent trend of red days, AMC will be over."

I have letters from 3 different OEMs that essentially say ""hey we know we didn't order some stuff earlier and that everyone is running really tight on labor and materials but we are going to increase orders by 120-130% to make up for all the stuff we didn't order over the past year and need to catch up on.  

There is legitimately no way this is sustainable/achievable.  Raw material markets are super tight, labor markets are tight, and normal demand was already well beyond what it was anytime in the past 5 years.  What the fuck guys."

Exhausted, he tosses his head back and the last of the beer in the can with it. He has been waiting up all night for a reply from that special someone with a response to his request. 

DING

His heart is racing, suddenly he’s not so tired any more. Did she say yes? Did she Call him a disgusting pig and chew him out in a novel sized rant? Jim slams his beer down and fumbles through his phone to open his telegram app. He takes a deep breath and opens the message. 

“Jimmy, of course! I would love to help you out, for the right price 😘

Tanker Gang - had extremely high rates due to oil over production. Stonks went up briefly but market is forward looking and realized these rates won’t last. Tanker stonks tank hard before rates even dropped 60-80% losses for many.

Overall Market - the market is forward looking - Fed announces inflation effects may be present as early as 2022. Market is suddenly blinded about the future and just wants to look at all the stimmy money that got pumped into its bloated corpse

Oh by the way we are beating our projected GDP by 2% for 2021- Market is suddenly forward looking again - but not too forward it’s just looking at the end of 2021 because it likes it.

Today I learned the market is a lazier and larger sack of denial eating piece of shit than I’ll ever hope to become someday.

NOK: Great Market growth plan, going to be the #1 distributor of 5g tech throughout Europe

CLOV: No debt and set to change the game in the healthcare industry. New data shows that the shorted shares are actually Class B shares which means above 90% of the float is shorted. Insane short squeeze potential.

BB: Is developing new technologies for Ford automobiles and other companies, little debt and fantastic market growth plan.

WKHS: Has laid out plans to make electric trucks and almost 50% of the float is shorted, which leaves really good short squeeze potential as well.

I'm not invested in any of the others so I don't know much about them."

Never feel bad for winning. GME was my first big play this year and I made around the same amount.

That being said: My last two $15k paydays were both selling calls on CLNE. The IV is juicy as fuck and it has a pretty solid floor. 

From what you've told me, I'm guessing you're almost at the point where you could make a living off some aggressive Theta plays. Go for it. You could pick something less volatile if you're more risk averse.

2021-06-21 18:41:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah my overall account is close to 150K with around 100K of that actually invested.

I was trading Theta with around 15K of my account for a while. Was getting around 1% ror/wk.

Theta seemed to dry up though, and I started selling shares in some of my moves and switch to LEAPS.

Then I saw the meme wheel picking up again. But instead it looked more like PnD for the past 2 weeks or so. Made some reasonable gains getting in those the day before a gap up. Basically half your moves can go to zero as long as 25% of your moves are 5 bagging.

For example toward the end of the day I thought about getting WISH calls. 50% worthless. 25% of a 5 bagger gap up tomorrow morning. Didn't do it this time.

But yeah Theta is probably my favorite strategy when I can find a ticker I believe in at a certain price, and the IV is high enough I can get 1% ror/wk.

I figure even if things are going like shit I should be able to make 1/4%/wk realized. So around 10-15K/yr.

But 30K isn't unrealistic.

Plus we have more money sitting around, and I'm approved for margin.

So maybe I could make 75K/yr or so. Staying aggressive with my cash and farther OTM with the margin, at least on the Put side."

&#x200B;

Spain won the world cup 2010:

S&P - 1283

S&P next 12 months -1342 (Coming out of looming double dip)

S&P next 24 months -1385

&#x200B;

Spain won the Euro 2012:

S&P - 1325

S&P next 12 months - 1643 (20% Run Up)

S&P next 24 months - 1978 (40% Run Up)

&#x200B;

Germany won the 2014 world cup -

S&P - 1978

S&P next 12 months - 2126

S&P next 24 months - 2161

&#x200B;

Portugal won the Euro 2016:

S&P - 2071

S&P next 12 months - 2425

S&P next 24 months - 3025 (50% run)

&#x200B;

France won the 2018 world cup -

S&P - 2873

S&P next 12 months -2990

S&P next 24 months -3215

&#x200B;

There appears a weird correlation between the Euro cup and the S&P 500 index.

On the other hand the data implies that World cup does not seem to have that big of an impact on the S&P 500.

The Index seems to perform exceedingly well when Spain or Portugal are the winners of Euro.

&#x200B;

So the best case scenario would be a Final between Portugal & Spain in which Portugal lift the EURO 2020 cup."

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Seeking Alpha article: Buy Rite Aid And Bet On Revenues Rebounding. (They also mentioned WSB!) # Summary

* Rite Aid stock fell sharply after last quarter's results.
* Heavy debt an ongoing concern.
* Investor interest in bricks-and-mortar retail drug stores may rise.
* Stock due for a short squeeze.

 

https://preview.redd.it/7f0isgwnpk671.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e4dec8f836338f689699f17b3590340b1330400

Since posting its fourth-quarter results, shares of Rite Aid (RAD) are trading in a tight range around its key moving average. With short-sellers circling RAD stock with a 16% short float, one would think that Reddit’s WallStreetBets would look at the turnaround pharmaceutical retailer more closely.

Rite Aid should join Reddit’s meme stock rally for two reasons: short-squeezing hedge funds and the company’s name. Just as ContextLogic’s (WISH) “wish” caught on, “Right” Aid may trend next in the sub-forum. Memes aside, investors may look at the company’s upcoming quarterly earnings this week next.

What should investors expect from Rite Aid?

# Mixed Q4/2021 Results

 

Last quarter, RAD stock slipped after posting anemic revenue growth of 3.3%. Same-store sales fell by 0.3% Y/Y. Sales in cough, cold, and flue-related categories fell by a disappointing 37%. With the stay-at-home order and working from home, customers were less likely to catch the cold flu. Now that Rite Aid is trading sharply below its $28 peak in 2021, the stock could come back from here.

Management forecasted total revenue in the first quarter in the range of $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion. Retail pharmacy same-store sales will fall by between 7% and 9%. It will earn up to $10 million in the first quarter. The company set a low bar. If its earnings come in higher on June 24, the stock could catch Reddit’s speculators quickly. Last week, Corsair Gaming (CRSR) and Rocket (RKT) both spiked higher. Neither stock shared any fundamental news that would explain the rally. CRSR and RKT stock have a short float of 6.5% and 17.7%, respectively. Unfortunately, both companies each have one major shareholder ready to sell the stock whenever it rallies.

In fairness, Rite Aid has 61% institutional ownership. This could limit the stock’s rally. Still, a brief jump would give speculators a quick profit this week.

&#x200B;

 

## Opportunity

Rite Aid’s modest revenue growth is frustrating shareholders. Digitally enabled sales grew by around 170% Y/Y but did little to add to the 3.3% increase in revenue.

Source: Rite Aid Q4 2021 Presentation

The retailer refreshed its website and mobile app. It updated the exterior of over 1,200 stores. So, as the US regains control over the Covid-19 pandemic, store traffic may improve. Rite Aid hired new sales and account management to implement its go-to-market strategies.

The soft peak flu and Covid are now behind.

The company completed its remerchandising strategy. It cleared all inventory that was not turning over and not relevant to its target customer. Now, it may pivot its sales as it opens new flagship stores. Pharmacy growth is critical to the company’s turnaround.

&#x200B;

 

## Risks

Amazon (AMZN) could renew its bid to dominate the drug pharmacy business. Walmart (WMT) may leverage its low-cost operating model and drive sales of drugs at its pharmacy. Given its barely $1 billion market capitalization, Rite Aid is nimble enough to respond. By comparison, Reddit’s favorite stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) trade at $26 billion and $30 billion market capitalization as of June 18. Still, debt weighs on RAD stock. As of Feb. 27, Rite Aid had $3.1 billion in debt:

## Related Investments

Income investors may consider Walgreens (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) instead. Both stocks score well on both the profitability and value categories. RAD stock only scores well on value. Plus, RAD stock scores better on growth than its peers:

*Data from SA Premium*

Given their strong profitability, both Walgreens and CVS Health are dividend income champs.

&#x200B;

Above: Rite Aid shares rose by above 100% before crashing lower in April.

Rite Aid does not pay a dividend and has a high debt-to-equity ratio. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Bausch Health (BHC) are examples of drug companies I analyzed before. They have high debt. Their performance weakens when interest rates rise.

&#x200B;

 

## Your Takeaway

The brick-and-mortar retailers are on the verge of a comeback. In the drug store space, Rite Aid is the smallest among the three firms. Speculators should look at this stock once again."

2021-06-21 09:22:02,wallstreetbets,"I agree.  If someone wants to get into the retail pharmacy market, you can not takeover CVS.  CVS is the #1 player with a nationwide presence and a market cap around $100 billion.  No way you are going to buy CVS.  Plus, CVS has north of $50 billion in long-term debt.  Take that into consideration, plus a premium for the buyout, and you are in the range of $175 billion.   Forget about it.

Next option is Walgreens.  Walgreens is also a national player, ranking in the #2 spot overall.  However, Walgreens has a market cap of $50 billion.  Just like with CVS, you'd have to pay a hefty premium to buyout Walgreens.   $60 or $70 billion is a tremendous amount to pay for such a takeover.   Add the long-term debt (about $12 billion, and now you are talking about $75 - $80 billion.  No one is going to do that.

Then there is Rite Aid, the #3 retail pharmacy in the nation.  RAD has 2,500+ stores in 19 states in the USA.   The current market cap is $1 Billion and the long term debt is $3 billion.  If you offered double or triple the current stock price, you are talking $5 - $6 billion for the acquisition of Rite Aid, all-in including the debt.  Clearly, for any company wanting to make a big move in the pharmacy sector such as Amazon or Walmar, RAD is the option that makes most sense.  You grab the number 3 slot in the market on the cheap, and you expand into other states over time, taking share away from CVS and Walgreens."
2021-06-21 04:58:45,wallstreetbets,And that is the reason to mention wsb in their report? Pleeease. It's fishing for buyers.
2021-06-21 08:39:21,wallstreetbets,"No, that's why buy the smallest lol"
2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Michael Burry back at it again (Scion 13F Bloomberg) 
2021-06-21 02:35:58,wallstreetbets,Back at what exactly ?
2021-06-21 03:00:41,wallstreetbets,Here’s the version that doesn’t cost 20k a year https://sec.report/Document/0001567619-21-010281/form13fInfoTable.html
2021-06-21 03:43:50,wallstreetbets,So his largest holding is Core Civic....
2021-06-21 08:57:28,wallstreetbets,"Sir, the WSB sentiment is now leaning to short the housing market because of Burry.

&#x200B;

Oh, based on what?

&#x200B;

Some guy named FartyMcShart posted a picture. Should... We include that in the investor report?"
2021-06-21 02:44:28,wallstreetbets,Too dumb to understand
2021-06-21 07:33:39,wallstreetbets,"This 13 F was filed weeks ago, old news"
2021-06-21 10:20:15,wallstreetbets,"""Suncoke Energy"" sounds like a Florida-based cocaine importer."
2021-06-21 09:23:30,wallstreetbets,Burry is long OTC American marijuana stocks!!!
2021-06-21 03:11:33,wallstreetbets,"He bought VACQ, you should too"
2021-06-21 03:35:54,wallstreetbets,Should I buy all of these or....
2021-06-21 04:32:59,wallstreetbets,Where is the huge short on Tesla? Did that expire out already.
2021-06-21 15:25:08,wallstreetbets,Fuck Michael Burry in his stupid dead eye
2021-06-21 08:53:41,wallstreetbets,Burry a wee bit too political for my taste lately.  I wouldn't be surprised if we hear that Q told him to bet on inflation.
2021-06-21 03:20:10,wallstreetbets,Does the 3/31 date mean its their q4 2020 info? Or just the start of the previous completed quarter?
2021-06-21 08:04:44,wallstreetbets,Way to early
2021-06-21 08:42:47,wallstreetbets,I don’t get it? What is he holding?
2021-06-21 17:18:48,wallstreetbets,This is like a month old news.
2021-06-21 17:58:17,wallstreetbets,"Guys this came out in May.... you know, when everyone was talking about how he has puts on tesla and calls on Facebook and Google?"
2021-06-21 03:54:26,wallstreetbets,"That guy is an idiot.. The US Govt will not allow this happen. 
Might as well hand the keys over to China and Russia if they do."
2021-06-21 02:46:38,wallstreetbets,"curious myself, but looking at this it just looks to show what he’s into and down on, but if someone sees something we dont please do explain?

2021-06-21 04:06:00,wallstreetbets,I've never been an ethical investor type but that's just disgusting.
2021-06-21 08:38:10,wallstreetbets,Around 40% of his last 13F consisted of puts on TSLA.
2021-06-21 07:13:25,wallstreetbets,So he probably hates black people
2021-06-21 06:48:54,wallstreetbets,"Core Civic Correction is a company that run private prisons. Their workforce literally works for free, basically slave labour. Solid company."
2021-06-21 02:51:46,wallstreetbets,That's not something to be proud of.

2021-06-21 04:53:39,wallstreetbets,What is your take on VACQ?
2021-06-21 08:55:21,wallstreetbets,Looks like he closed.
2021-06-21 13:04:05,wallstreetbets,No telling. This is what he had at the end of March
2021-06-21 05:42:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah and the US government won’t allow the economy to collapse like they did in 2008 either right? Don’t be such a moron.
2021-06-21 03:11:40,wallstreetbets,For sure I was just saying he’s short real estate nothing too high level or complicated this is also from the end of march
2021-06-21 13:41:20,wallstreetbets,"OP thinks he’s short on RE because his positions over Q1 went down 15%. Yet several of his top holdings are RE based so. 

Not only that, but this is three months old (3/31). And, as was said, he continues to buy."
2021-06-21 12:46:55,wallstreetbets,I’ll bet on Return of the Mack
2021-06-21 05:15:31,wallstreetbets,Private prisons
2021-06-21 07:35:40,wallstreetbets,Isnt your comment racist by assuming only black people go to prison?
2021-06-21 07:26:58,wallstreetbets,I think its more about liking money
2021-06-21 08:41:02,wallstreetbets,Kind of like amazon?
2021-06-21 08:17:47,wallstreetbets,Its 50/50. They either go up or they go down.
2021-06-21 07:32:58,wallstreetbets,Precisely because of 2008.
2021-06-21 06:11:56,wallstreetbets,"Lol , it's not 2008. Don't under estimate the power of growth and lessons learnt and established from the past.  There will be pull backs but nothing like 2008. Otherwise we wouldn't be here ti say there is a pull back. Smart investors buy here."
2021-06-21 03:26:10,wallstreetbets,How is he short real estate?
2021-06-21 03:13:01,wallstreetbets,Also if anyone wants anything else from Bloomberg let me know it’s nice but as nopornforme69 mentioned below all this information is publicly available for free
2021-06-21 09:10:49,wallstreetbets,"Hey bro I just checked and looks like he’s long on real estate and not shorting it. He’s short on Tesla, 20+ year treasury ETFs (Treasury bonds), Some financial institutions he’s short and some he’s long, but he seems to be long real estate not short."
2021-06-21 05:50:14,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm

On the state level they are safe, federally safe too despite the rhetoric"
2021-06-21 07:42:52,wallstreetbets,How dare you make an assumption from my assumption
2021-06-21 07:46:52,wallstreetbets,Maybe he's basing his comment on the violent crime rates where Core Civic prisons exist?
2021-06-21 19:24:50,wallstreetbets,Selling your soul is never worth it. Just fuck private prisons.
2021-06-21 08:52:58,wallstreetbets,Edgy
2021-06-21 08:48:33,wallstreetbets,Yeah except the workers are convicted felons who can't just walk out and quit.
2021-06-21 10:48:16,wallstreetbets,You forgot sideways.
2021-06-21 14:17:21,wallstreetbets,Sometimes all directions violently at once.
2021-06-21 13:40:39,wallstreetbets,LOL!!! He thinks the banks aren't recreating 2008 on purpose with Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities by abusing the rating system *again* while investing against them to profit off their crash and then when smaller financial companies go under they get to swoop in and buy them at deep discount to consolidate their power further.
2021-06-21 07:04:19,wallstreetbets,"Jebuss. You really are drinking the cool-aid aren't you?  Greedy people do not get less greedy with time, they get more greedy. Wake up dude.. I can't listen to this kind of dumb.. Blocked.."

2021-06-21 08:40:45,wallstreetbets,If it's publicly available for free then why does Bloomberg cost so damn much?
2021-06-21 10:07:03,wallstreetbets,"was wondering same thing. Can somebody please confirm? I am too retarded to read a terminal 

shorting real estate doesn't seem to be a play for inflation"
2021-06-21 09:01:08,wallstreetbets,I'd call it profitable.
2021-06-21 07:20:08,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. Ok pal. You pay your ticket your way . Il stick to my research and analysis.

2021-06-21 09:09:28,wallstreetbets,"I think part of it is that it’s putting all the info in one place, there was a time when there was a lot of value in the terminal and I think the hype/ branding has held up. Plus if your a big hedge on wall st making billions you probably don’t care about 20k per term to run a few of these bad boys"
2021-06-21 09:07:38,wallstreetbets,"There weren’t any free resources available until the last 6 months or so.  Bloomberg is expensive because it’s a barrier to entry for the average retail trader, on purpose."
2021-06-21 07:34:31,wallstreetbets,The guy is prpbably out of the market since loosing everything and then selling early 2009. Those guys that have been saying for 12 years that it was a fake recovery and the end was near.

2021-06-21 06:12:55,wallstreetbets,I think it's a form of playing both sides to minimize loss; a move in either direction yields some benefit. But I'm too much of a neophyte to really understand.
2021-06-21 10:45:13,wallstreetbets,"When buying a call, your max loss is how much you pay for the call. Say you buy a call with a $10 strike price. It expires on July 16. You paid $1 ($1 x 100 shares = $100).

July 16 comes and at close the share price is $8... you lost $100."
2021-06-21 06:34:50,wallstreetbets,That’s untrue humans produce way more methane and CO2 with a net population around 7.2 billion. Also there is no way cows out produce Buffalo herds pre colonization.
2021-06-21 08:49:58,wallstreetbets,"A house is for sale at $100,000 right now. There's a piece of land next door that they're going to turn into a landfill or bird sanctuary. Obviously landfill will cause loss of property value, bird sanctuary will raise it. You pay a $5,000 premium for the right to buy that house within the next 3 months at $100,000. If they build landfill and value of home drops to $50,000 you're only out  $5,000 premium (instead of a $50,000 loss). If they build bird sanctuary and value rises to $150,000, then you've made $45,000. You can also sell your contract to someone else before the expiration and collect their premium, which means you no longer have the right to buy the house but can pocket the money you sold their premium for (I.e. You sell it for $10,000 a month before expiration, so you make $5,000 profit). Hope that helps. 
 
Edit: Some other things for clarity. A call is a bet the price will go UP. A put is a bet the price will go DOWN. Strike price is your betting price and the price you will buy the shares at if you decide to purchase them and are ""in the money"" by expiration date. A contract is always in units of 100 shares. So if a call option is selling at $1.50 it's actually $150. You aren't responsible for coming up with the money to pay for all 100 shares unless you let it expire in the money or beyond your strike price. There's a ton more, would look up on YouTube or Tastytrade."
2021-06-21 08:49:15,wallstreetbets,"A Call Option gives the buyer the ability to purchase 100 shares of stock at a specific price (called the ""strike price"") within a time limit (the ""expiration"").

If the price of the stock goes above the strike price, you can sell the Option and keep the profit without ever having to buy the actual shares."

It's going to go up or down and you're using a down strategy and and up strategy to your advantage. If/when it goes down, you reap that benefit and if/when it goes up there are plays made that yield benefits too. 

A novice like me; I just play the long (Up) strategy of buying shares in companies that will have future value.

He sold 10, $10 puts for a credit of $1600. Then he bought 10, $7 puts for $350. So he gets a total credit of $1250 which he gets to keep if the price is above $10 @ expiration. 

The strike prices are $3 apart. So, his ""max loss"" is 10 contracts x 100 shares x $3 = $3000. BUT, he received a $1250 credit, so his actual max loss is $1750. 

As time goes by, the value of the put positions go down and he gets to keep the $1250. As long as the share price doesn't drop below $8.75 AT EXPIRATION he will not lose any money."

2021-06-21 12:44:54,wallstreetbets,"A Put Credit Spread is a strategy where you think the stock will either go up/down slightly or stay flat. You sell a strike you like and buy another strike lower. That means you get the money upfront and hope for the stock not to close below your short strike at expiration. In this example, he is short at $10 and long at $7, so he will have maximum gain (with both options going to zero) if the price is above $10 at expiration."
2021-06-21 12:45:28,wallstreetbets,A Put Credit Spread is a long strategy.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Atypical DD for WSB: ATSG for a smooth ascent **TLDR: ATSG is a fantastic value at its current price and a low float ticker that is primed for run given current marco economic factors in conjunction with some other bullish reasons I’ll get into below.** >!DO NOT EXPECT A 10 BAGGER!<

**Who**: ATSG, Air Transport Services Group, provides air cargo transportation services to a wide variety of industries and customers. Not only do they move shit from Pt A to Pt B, they also have subsidiaries that customers, like Amazon, use to help make logistics and transportation challenges more manageable.

**Why do I care?** The underlying business model is incredibly resilient. Transportation and supply chain issues will be an ongoing theme for the months and most likely, years to come, as COVID exposed just how fragile and anemic our global infrastructure truly was. As a result, companies will have to continue to look for new ways to get products from one point to another, ensuring they don’t churn customers due to poor experiences. A great example of this is PTON having to start air shipping treadmills and bikes from their manufacturing plants to distribution centers whereas in the past, they could put those products on cargo container ships. Ports are fucked, so PTON decided to spend hundreds of millions of dollars extra to fly those heavy pieces of equipment to end markets. Air transport will be taking on an ever-increasing share of global supply chains and commerce. Fundamentally speaking, take a look ATSG performance over the past few quarters and years, and you’ll see a steady increase and march upwards for revenue, margins, EPS, etc…

**EPS**

While COVID provided some challenges, it’s also allowed ATSG to become increasingly relevant in the global supply chain and, oh yea, there is one more thing that is incredibly bullish for ATSG: AMAZON

**Bull Case 1**: Acquisition Amazon has been a longtime customer of ATSG, and [back in March, they exercised warrants to acquire roughly 20% of the company](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/amazon-takes-minority-stake-in-cargo-contractor-atsg.html).

>Amazon exercised warrants in ATSG that will allow it to acquire about 13.5 million shares in the cargo airline at an exercise price of $9.73 per share, or more than $131.9 million, ATSG said in an SEC filing Monday. As part of a separate agreement, Amazon also purchased approximately 865,000 shares of ATSG, with no cash exchanging hands, the filing states…. Amazon has owned warrants in ATSG since 2016

Amazon is also [“poised to perhaps double that stake in the future”](https://www.aviationpros.com/airlines/news/21221040/atsg-emerges-stronger-from-covid-with-amazon-investment). Also worth noting, Amazon does business with almost all of the other subsidiaries and organizations under the ATSG corporate umbrella. This includes Cargo Aircraft Management (leasing), ABX Air (air cargo and passenger airlift) and Airborne Maintenance & Engineering (maintenance services).

***Hmm, that's a lot of connections (and money flowing) between Amazon and ATSG.***

So Amazon continues to want to own its entire logistics network and supply chain, and they’re assuming an increasing stake in a company that provides all of those services under one roof. If that’s not enough, consider that Amazon has held the warrants to ATSG since 2016. Why exercise now?

**Bull Case 2**: Massively undervalued All of the reasons I’ve stated so far, but also add on the fact that ATSG, as a company, is INCREDIBLY undervalued right now. Look at peers in the industry and compare their fundamentals and book value to ATSG. If you zoom out on the 5 year chart for ATSG, and just do a simple overlay of EPS and revenues, you’ll see ATSG, as a stock, has gone practically nowhere despite their success in terms of financial performance. In fact, if you take a look at implied value (comparing historic multiples in this space) to ATSG, it is at roughly a 35% discount to it’s FMV.

And that’s being conservative. But don’t take my word for it, analysts that cover ATSG agree that the price target for the stock is in the range of $31 to $35

**What else?** A couple of other reasons to be bullish on ATSG:

High institutional ownership. Right now, according to a couple of resources online that I checked, the amount of shares owned by institutions (including Amazon) is somewhere in the range of 77% all the way up to 94%. What does this mean? It means the float is INCREDIBLY small.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1nkmv2flhj671.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=805b8f73213cee5d4df7db3deb33f8fb5b24f431

***Historically low IV***: I’m not sure options are the way to play this, but if that’s your thing, calls are very cheap right now. The options chain is NOT stacked at all, and that’s not something I’m highlighting, but if you go look at ATM calls for September or December, they are dirt cheap.

**To summarize**, there are many reasons to be bullish on ATSG:

1. Re-opening play
2. Global macro environment favorable to air transport
3. Potential Amazon acquisition
4. Undervalued vs. industry peers
5. High institutional ownership, low float and solid balance sheet

**Notice what’s NOT listed above?** Yea, I’m not a fucking retard trying to shoehorn that narrative in here as it’s not relevant. I genuinely like the business and I’ll be increasing my position over the next few weeks. For now, my positions:

20x 30c 9/17 (down 25%)

2021-06-21 03:12:11,wallstreetbets,"How does ATSG compare to AAWW, seems like they do they’re in the same industry, similar market cap, but AAWW makes more money, and looks healthier and with a much lower PE ratio."
2021-06-21 03:33:11,wallstreetbets,I love ATSG. So many reasons to love it
2021-06-21 16:10:27,wallstreetbets,Pretty decent year over year support at this level. I think if I can get it at around $21 I’ll be stoked..
2021-06-21 11:06:03,wallstreetbets,"Tbh I can't say for certain, but it seemed to follow the other transport tickers in this space (fdx, ups) that has a small pull back. Overall, ATSG doesn't really seem to carry much momentum lately given its super low volume on the daily. Anyone that wants to influence share price can do so easily based on the low volume and low float. Longer term, I fully expect ATSG to retake ATHs over the next few months."
2021-06-21 10:50:58,wallstreetbets,"I have the same question, and wondering about the drop in earnings last quarter. Looks like a miss, performing worse than last year when air cargo rates were at ATH. I like this stock but I think the air cargo portion of earnings is less than the passenger part of earnings -- hence the significant miss in EPS. Yet, anytime I see it posted the air cargo aspect is the only thing mentioned"
2021-06-21 11:09:21,wallstreetbets,"ATSG has more exposure to passenger air transport space. They obviously dont transport like Delta and those types of carriers, but their service/maintenance business does work with those types of organizations. As passenger travel picks up, I'd expect that segment of their business to pick up as well and close the gap."

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SENS DD SENS why to buy
 Skip to end to see summary 
Catalyst 

SENS CGM system has been remodeled and improved to last 180 days, and is awaiting approval from the FDA. The chances of it being approved are high considering that it’s already being used In Europe. Keep in mind America makes up about 96% of the market share. Due to Covid-19 the approval was pushed back and is thought to be some time around the middle of this year.

This has caught the eye of institutional buyers as 25% of the stock and 50% of the float is held by institutional buyers. Recently, H.C. Wainwright agreed to buy about 25,974,026 shares at 1.925 per share. Within days the same Hedge Fund agreed to increase the magnitude of their purchase to 51,948,052 shares at the same price. The total value of the purchase is exactly 100 million dollars. Then on January 21st, it was bought deal valuing the total purchase at 115 million

SENS has 14 patents all relating to the design and specific parts of their CGM system

The way a normal CGM system works is a tiny sensor with a needle is inserted under your skin and then it measures your glucose levels while lasting up to 7-14 days. Twice a day you need to check the CGM system itself by pricking your finger and inserting a drop of blood. You also need to replace the CGM sensor every 3-7 days which requires you to remove the entire device. 

The Percentage of Americans with type 1 diabetes that use a CGM is now on an exponential growth curve rising from 12% in 2014 to 24% in 2016 to 38% in 2018 

The general market concentration has about 4 major players
Dexcom, Abbott, Medtronic, and Senseonics. So this market is extremely concentrated

Out of all the other companies that are solely devoted to the design and manufacturing of CgM devices there are 26 competitors , however Senseonics has received the most funding at 143.4 million.

Also the main subject behind the majority of their patents is analytical chemistry, analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. In other words, it is the art and science of determining what matter is and how much of it exists.

And while yes this field is being used to separate and measure the glucose levels within the human Body, this field is very wide and offers a wide selection of possible futures, once revenue increases. 



Out of the past 4 quarters SENS has beat revenue expectations 3 times and beat EPS estimates twice.




Continuous Glucose Monitoring Market 

-Current market dynamics and growth opportunities
-Technological advances on the market 
-Strategies and different product innovations for major players 

Two things make up the CGM market, the components used and the geographical location of the company 


MARKET DRIVERS

Surge in diabetic population
-205.47 million people suffer from diabetes in China and India
-20 million had type 1 diabetes
****
America:
-2.7 million Americans have type 1 diabetes 
-32.3 million Americans have type 2 diabetes
-Diabetics have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized, thus increasing expenses or cautionary measures
-In developed countries close to 90% of type 1 diabetes patients use glucose meters, 50% of type 2 may also use glucose meters

With increasing awareness among the type 2 diabetes patients, demand for CGM devices has been rising at a rapid pace 

In 2016 there were about 321 million people with diabetes, by 2020 the number has increased about ten percent to 361 million. 

2017 Increased 2.18 percent 
2018 Increased 3.96 percent 
2019 Increased 2.93 percent 
2020 Increased 2.84 percent 



SENSORS
Eversense CGM System, an implantable glucose sensor by Senseonics Incorporated was launched in 2018. The advantage of Eversense CGM System is that it can remain in place for up to three months, where the other CGMs sensors remain in place for up to 3-10 days.

MARKET SEGMENT
Medical devices occupied 27.7% of the share in 2020

Between 2018 and 2020, Senseonic generated a meager $8.3 million in product revenue. It cannot manage to break even in terms of gross margin. Since its inception in 1996, the company has lost $648.5 million. Before its $175 million equity infusion in Q1 2021, the company had just $35.9 million in assets to offset $177.2 million in liabilities.
Possible downsides: 
Its peers, such as Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT), Dexcom, and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), are all better capitalized and farther ahead in their technology. By the time Senseonic launches Eversense 365, its competitors will likely have moved on to seventh or eighth-generation CGMs. It's typically not a good idea to go long on stocks of a healthcare company that can only play catch-up. 


Summary: As an investor I typically like to follow Socially Responsible Investing/ Value Investing. Looking at the companies free cash flow/ ebitda ratio shows that they are in a good position to grow, along with pending FDA approval for their 180 day CGM device. Also considering majority of diabetics have said they would prefer this over the dexcomm CGM device it shows promise. Overall I believe SENS can have great enterprise value and wouldn’t be surprised to see it trading around 30 dollars EOY. 


Disclaimer: Normally I Buy a stock within 10-15% of a 52 week low that’s shown itself to offer some price support. If in this case it breaks to a new low, cut losses.
Also look into rare birds, asset plays, to a lesser extent, arbitrage opportunities and companies selling at less than two thirds of net value (net working capital less liabilities). So I am breaking my usual buying pattern.
I am also buying an additional 50,000 shares, currently holding 10,000"

That would surprise me, but I wouldn't complain. I'm thinking it'll hit the $7-10 range on FDA approval, based on my gut (aka absolutely nothing)."

2021-06-21 00:35:48,wallstreetbets,"Yes! Finally someone talking about sens in wsb. Huge potential here for the long term. 3-5 year hold for me. Got in February, 623 @ $4.19. Unfortunately didn't have the money at the time to avg down, but in the long term it doesn't matter."
2021-06-21 05:34:22,wallstreetbets,"This sounds cool and all but it’s a 1.4 billion dollar market cap, that’s lost increasingly more money year over year and currently has a negitive share holders equity. 

In other words it owes more then it owns and has lost more and more money every year not the greatest looking long term play just sayin"
2021-06-21 05:34:56,wallstreetbets,"Problem with the 180 day device is that they still require 1 calibration (finger pricking) every day which is a game ruiner, while the dexcom and libre only need calibrations when the numbers are off.

Eversense is still far behind and has a long way to catch up. The fda approval on the 180 day device will be a huge improvement but it wont be even close to catching up with its piers. The 365 day device with calibrations once every week is what will give them the edge.

Most stock holders that arent the patients themselves dont understand what these patients are looking for in their devices. Sens holders must look into these diabetic communities."
2021-06-20 23:46:09,wallstreetbets,1st. Suck it suckers!!
2021-06-21 01:46:18,wallstreetbets,"The incentives for sens to be utilized by patients are completely off. It requires an incision by a medical provider and the monitoring software isn’t the most user friendly. The industry is moving towards cheap and disposable noninvasive application to be palatable to the general public, mostly those who are not insulin dependent  as T2DM is greatly increasing the TAM of these CGM companies. 

If you want to invest for the technology, DXCM would be the best choice even despite its current premium as it continues to penetrate the pharmacy channel distribution. 

If you want to invest in a startup with much more potential than sens at a super low market cap versus its TAM, invest in NMRD. FDA approval coming this November."

2021-06-21 13:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you’re not wrong, my 30 estimate is crazy bullish, but I’m buying my 50k shares at around 2.84 as my entry price"
2021-06-21 02:40:04,wallstreetbets,same actually which is odd. lol
2021-06-21 02:30:58,wallstreetbets,Honestly I think it can go a lot higher in the 6 months-3 years range. With the FDA approval it should see a major spike
2021-06-21 06:44:00,wallstreetbets,I get the point but this isn’t unique to a med tech company. Most of them spend years burning through cash on R&D until they can get a marketable product. SENS has that now with the 180 day product.
2021-06-21 09:00:42,wallstreetbets,They’ve also received 145 million in additional funding
2021-06-21 15:17:05,wallstreetbets,This is pretty big if true. My understanding was no more finger pricking on the 180 day device but that goes out the window if it needs to be calibrated every day.
2021-06-20 23:51:11,wallstreetbets,What?
2021-06-21 00:27:34,wallstreetbets,2nd
2021-06-21 03:15:00,wallstreetbets,There are videos that show how minor the incision and in office procedure is. And soon that will only be twice a year. Accuracy will continue to be a huge hurdle for non invasive tech like NMRD. Maybe fine for type 2s but not good enough for type 1s. People already have accuracy issues with products like Dexcom that actually touch fluid under the skin. If you look 3-4 years down their pipeline SENS will have a 360 day sensor on a closed loop system and no on body transmitter. Nothing being worn on the skin. It’s a level of “freedom” only a subcutaneous product can achieve.
2021-06-21 02:47:36,wallstreetbets,"You have a point that many ppl might not want a procedure done. But when u factor in health insurance, u think they wanna pay for dexcoms monitor when they have a much cheaper alternative? There's a reason why ascensia teamed up with senseonics and not dexcom, and there's a reason why medicaid / Medicare in the US already agreed to pay for senseonics' 90 day cgm. Dexcom could very well make technological advancements in the disposable monitors, but for now the logical choice (and maybe forced choice?) is senseonics for the near future."

2021-06-21 15:41:11,wallstreetbets,True but most of those companies don’t get bought for 1.4 billion out the gate which is the current pay to play price on the stock market.
2021-06-21 15:41:43,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that just more debt lowering their shareholders equity more?
2021-06-21 16:14:13,wallstreetbets,180 will still need once per day calibration. 360 will get it down to once per week. They start trials on that this year.

2021-06-21 02:52:37,wallstreetbets,"Hmmmm I expect the FDA approval to come around August and after an increase of 600% I wouldn’t be surprised to see it dip under $3, however, my dumbass is bagholding and need to do some technical analysis on what’s gonna happen. So yes a dip is definitely possible, however if you’re in it to hold a few months I don’t think buying in now will make a difference. Although Monday I am more than likely going to be buying about 50,000 shares after figuring out a gods entry point. So I’ll update you then"
2021-06-21 02:55:28,wallstreetbets,Please do. Lol. I'll probably buy in more tomorrow. I'll see what happens after open
2021-06-21 11:27:30,wallstreetbets,"Haha holy shit, thank god I didn’t but market open. Would defiantly not be surprised to see it go below 3 now I’m putting my entry price around 2.84 according the rsi, sma, and line of regression."
2021-06-21 11:34:52,wallstreetbets,Lmfao I threw $1k in at $3.22 wanted to see what would happen. Next $1k will go in sub $3
2021-06-21 11:41:08,wallstreetbets,"Hey hopefully I’m wrong and it shoots up before that. If not defiantly buying around 70,000 shares at discounted price"

2021-06-21 01:11:17,wallstreetbets,Don’t know about others but after some time I started noticing that plot devices were highly dictated by ExMachina style causes. Also the main antagonist came out of nowhere and Walter kind of slowly fizzles out instead of becoming king pin of an empire. Everything up until end of season 4 was great but last season was just weak imo.

Check BB Financials and you'll know this is a waste of a stock that's being shoved down your throats just as it was done back in January. All these people commenting they have XXX amount of shares don't have anything. Do your own research and come to your own conclusion that BB is another waste of a stock until they can have a decent financial record.
2021-06-21 04:13:45,wallstreetbets,Every single car company? Or not. It says in the article you posted they were dropped by Ford. And are mainly focusing on the Chinese market.

2021-06-20 20:58:37,wallstreetbets,So I just learned about options. I see you mentioned $10 call on CLNE for Friday. So you bought the contract at a strike price of $10? It's 11.83 currently I think. So how would you make money? Sorry if I'm an idiot asking obvious questions. I know I'm missing something huge here.

2021-06-21 09:03:21,wallstreetbets,Yup the plan is to hold
2021-06-20 22:34:17,wallstreetbets,Im gonna be holding CLNE because I think it can go up even without major support from WSB

2021-06-20 21:47:46,wallstreetbets,CLNE is the move. I’m holding the stock long term and swing trading around my core position. Selling some shares and covered calls when it pops and buying back on the dips.
2021-06-20 21:13:26,wallstreetbets,"It could be a few things. 
I am guessing the Op could have purchased these much earlier at a lower option price. Option prices go up with the price of the underlying security (CLNE) and volume.  As the expiration date nears, the price of the option will be closer aligned to the price of the stock and the time/value will decrease. 
Because the volatility and volume of CLNE is high, the cost of the options is higher so long as there is time left before expiration if out of the money. 
I hope this helps and did not cause more confusion."

I know that's where extrinsic value comes in but how???"
2021-06-20 23:30:20,wallstreetbets,Plot foiled good sir. Bet you didn't expect me to see this comment!
2021-06-20 21:13:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm loading up. Latest rumor is that the float it's actually over 90% shorted. There's a miscalculation and a lot of the shares that are listed as available are actually  ""b shares"" which means they cannot be traded."
2021-06-21 14:16:40,wallstreetbets,I didn't get it.
2021-06-20 22:07:06,wallstreetbets,"So the price you pay is just for the call (or put) option.  That is the option to purchase the stock at that strike price. So, if the option is 1.80 and the strike is $10, you have paid $180 ($1.80 x 100) for the privilege to buy the stock at $10. For you to make money, the stock would have to be at $11.80 at expiration.  

The price for an option will always be AT LEAST  the strike price plus any gains the underlying security has over the strike price.   For instance, say there is an option that expires this week with a $10 strike price and the stock is trading at $12.00. The option price will be higher than $2.00. 
EDIT:  I have seen some stock options that are deep in the money having a very minor discount if purchased then executed. One would have to take into account brokerage fees for both buying the option then executing it to see if it is worth it. 

Most people sell their options prior to expiration and do not execute the purchase. One reason may be capital.  One option contract is for 100 shares, so a stock strike price of $50 would cost $5,000 to execute the buy. 

TD Ameritrade has some free videos that explain option trading. You can also practice with a 'paper' account and see how they work.

Feel free to ask anything. I'll do my best to help."
2021-06-21 10:51:40,wallstreetbets,"Start tracking a stock and the option chain for a certain contract, and watch the price of the contract change as stock price changes. Could pick $BB and watch the $12 or $13 strike, near term expiration"

1. The amount of debt is never the issue, it’s the cost of that debt
2. NCLH got a great deal on the cost of their debt
3. Debt can also be paid off, and paid of quickly when you have raised enough money to go zero cash flow until the end of 2022, but are on the precipice of a return to business, and likely record bookings in successive years to come
4. As a comp look to the airlines: they’ve had pricing power, and inflation has actually helped them as they can cover the increasing costs and then some for their own coffers. Remember when talking heads said the same about airlines as they’re saying about about cruises now? It was dilution and debt, check out the airlines current stock prices, and their climbing still during a broad sell off. TSA check-ins never surpassed 2 million since the Covid era began, until…June 11th since then there have been 4 days were passenger traffic surpassed 2 million Takeaway: Leisure travel is back in a big way
 5. Cruisers are almost cult like in their obsession for cruising do not underestimate this, especially when comping with airlines who’s full rebound still requires business travelers in the mix, cruising is 100 leisure 
6. Leisure is likely to have a Renaissance for the next 2.5-3 years due to pent up demand 
7. Federal courts are about to get Florida/Texas and the Feds on the same page for cruising regulation
8. On Friday a federal judge issued an injunction against the CDC sending them back to mediation with Florida saying the CDC is currently asking too much of the cruise lines, regulations  are now tilting in favor of cruise lines
9. NCLH has recruited and paid former heads of the CDC, and FDA to advise them and do things right they are now outfitted with air filtering, labs, medical facilities, continual testing, vaccinated staff, etc
10. Biden is going to declare victory over covid this 4th of July, or something damn near it, he can’t do that without clearing a large public facing industry’s path further, think of the momentum and ensuing rally for the reopening stocks, especially the ones that have yet to recover. Wait, which have yet to recover?
11. unlike other covid recovery plays NCLH it’s still approx some 60% down from its 5 year average pre covid 
12. The stock is bouncing off its 50 day moving average a few points down from its all time post covid high. Not only is there an uptrend, but lots of consolidation  
13. We are likely to hit under an average of 5k daily covid cases nationwide this upcoming week 
14. CEO Del Rio is one bad mofo 
15. Del Rio has reported record demand for bookings 
16. Stock options are cheap right now, especially after last weeks sell off 
17. Upgrades from Goldman, JPM, Wolfe
18. It’s not a matter of if, but when
 19. Climb on in, strap up and let’s cruise on to the ocean on Jupiter’s Moon  NCLH to Europa!🚀🌕🌊"

2021-06-21 19:08:37,wallstreetbets,"That’ll take a lot longer for me to write up, in short you have these different factions wanting to emerge with more shine for themselves/causes, the CDC already got to stall long enough to drive cases way down, and Desantis got to play hero by way of the courts decision. Ultimately  the end goal is the same: continuing to support the reopening. What’s shaking out is the oversight that matters will stay, and the more ridiculous ones like test cruises, port agreements, applications to cruise, etc. will soon fall by the wayside. My guess is by next week the CDC will emerge from mediation with Florida with a more streamlined essential plan to present to the court, if they don’t the best they can do is appeal. That’s not a good look as it is a default anti-reopening stance. Instead they’re going to want to get this done before Biden’s July 4th great American reopening and we have  the first paid cruise taking off from Florida on the 26th, which will prove Desantis is also unwilling to stop the cruise lines from conducting business. Either way there is a short time line in place now, during which any lingering doubts about no sailing this summer will be erased, giving way to more and more bookings and safe cruising."
2021-06-20 22:35:42,wallstreetbets,"Over 46 million Americans are over the age of 60. The average age of a cruiser is actually 47, so add another 31 million Americans 47-60 years of age, that's some  77 million. Add in those in the group with children and you're around 100 million that's  30% of all Americans. Add in cruisers from foreign countries. Who do you think has more money to spend, older or younger people? It's about cash flow not ageism. Do your homework. I'm not advocating cruises, I'm saying I like the stock."

I’m 38, previously lived in Miami and I do not know a single person my age that’s been on a cruise in the past decade or who would consider going on one out of a domestic port.  Totally different demographic I suppose…. And news to you:  the people going on cruises are not the people with a lot of discretionary money.   It’s the poor man’s family vacation. 

It’s not a matter of homework, it’s a matter of macro trends and cruises went out sometime in the 1990s with nylon wind-breakers. 

Leisure travel, yes.  A come-back of sedimentary vacations after Americans have been cooped up for a year:  Doubt it.  And long term I would not touch the entire industry.  Too many companies out there that aren’t losing money in a dying industry.  Best of luck."
2021-06-21 00:42:44,wallstreetbets,"You are espousing macro economics while at the same time  discussing your small circle of friends? Then you pile on off the cuff ideas about the 90s, with zero numbers to back it up? The cruise industry had record setting revenues in 2019 of 20.8 billion. NCLH had over 6 billion dollars of revenue in 2019, compared to about 800 million in 1999. I believe the record number for passengers was in 2015 (not the 90's), but as stated previously the rate of bookings are currently exceeding anything the cruise lines have seen previously according to their executive's. Have you heard of coivd? That is the macro story here, not your Miami friends in the 90s, or what you have personally noticed, or in this case not noticed. Did you happen to notice amongst people at large 90s fashions are back in a big way, you might want to let your friends in Miami know, they will appreciate your shrewd deductive prowess..."

2021-06-20 22:57:01,wallstreetbets,It’s not. There’s a distinction: Tax avoidance is legal. Tax evasion is not. This would be an example of avoidance. Misreporting income would be evasion.

2021-06-20 22:03:17,wallstreetbets,Where is CLNE chart? Mods hate this stock.
2021-06-21 07:17:43,wallstreetbets,"Original meme stocks were quite simply GME & BB in early Jan when sub was 4m members or so

Then AMC & NOK came along. Really NOK? of all stonks, NOK? The float is so huge it's dumber than a rock to imagine squeezing it or imagine it doing anything massive.

When momentum built on GME everything else was crushed by post deletion at the end of Jan **but especially BB**.

My guess is mods wanted GME to moon & had stocks in GME and maybe some AMC but definitely not BB.

Now they have cashed out of GME so could care less, it's abut membership numbers and not anything in particular stock-wise. Well done you took away BB's chance to properly moon and now the funds who came in after the crash post-Jan are controlling the SP action.

FACT? I think so"

2021-06-20 22:44:09,wallstreetbets,"I can see why much of the content in this sub relates to the above stocks. And I see why many don’t believe in DD’s from other stocks from outsiders/newcomers as being reliable information. 

I suppose I’m still a newcomer, I believe I joined in around January-February. I do see many people comment about Wendy’s jokes, and was wondering why Wendy’s isn’t a meme stock like some of the above stocks. 

I’m sure someone out there is educated enough to give me a decent answer. TIA."

2021-06-21 00:47:33,wallstreetbets,i could just be skeptical but the sentiment/popularity of CLNE hasnt matched the amount of DD. each day i look for DD and find max 2 while other popular tickers have double digits

CLOV is a legit company with sector-disrupting potential, great YoY growth, 700MM in the bank, is hugely undervalued compared to it's peers, and WAY more short squeeze potential than any other stock on here IMO.  /r/clov does seem a little too desperate to get WSB mentions sometimes, but it really should be getting more attention here IMO."

I mean that is manipulation right there"
2021-06-21 11:35:16,wallstreetbets,"I think what would help this more is adding a timeline or how far does this data go. For example, if looking at just this year, then of course stocks like AMC and GME would stand out given the number of daily/weekly threads including pinned posts when GME was numbered like day x of GME. For WISH and CLOV, those raised up a lot in the last month compared to GME and AMC.

The overall rate doesn’t reflect a bias, but it’s important to have a timeline because if in the last month, as Wish, Clov, and AMC started overshadowing GME, then it could mean GME posts were not as approved in the one month instead of whenever how far this data takes us."
2021-06-21 12:55:58,wallstreetbets,"Does true mean approved, right?"
2021-06-21 13:13:13,wallstreetbets,Maybe cause the mods don’t want 10 million users in a sub that isn’t what the sub was created for?

2021-06-21 09:11:53,wallstreetbets,"Can I just ask a logic question? 

How can you determine with the certainty I hear in your words that there has been fair treatment of DDs if you just post all time total numbers? Wouldn’t it make more sense to compare the daily DDs before and after the accusations started?

I’m just saying if your goal is to truly clear your name, the logic and data you presented is meaningless in this context"

It may not stop everything, but fuck do you guys ever do a good job. Legit not trying to pump your tires, but more of being completely real on the subject.

They're not working hard enough to actively discourage this fracturing.

They could literally have worked with you months ago to demonstrate that wsb has integrity and a process, instead they'd rather be ignorant or some shit idfk. If I assumed the worst, I'd assume they like the narrative so that they have more subreddit growth."
2021-06-21 10:47:32,wallstreetbets,Any one can hide time dependent bias in an aggregate result. We need the raw time series data to plot bias by time of day to prove that the approved DD stats aren’t pumped in off peak hours to mask high disproval rates during peak hours.
2021-06-21 11:36:40,wallstreetbets,I don’t think these charts say what you think they say.  They prove the case against you guys.

2021-06-21 12:56:28,wallstreetbets,You speak from my heart ❤️ try calling out the bad DD on live and some will even ban you. A profile that has posted a handful DD with 5 or less upvotes doesn’t qualify as relevant enough for banning others who request for it to be pulled down.
2021-06-21 15:26:09,wallstreetbets,"Can I ask why a specific post got deleted? For example, I tried posting DD on $WKHS with information I pulled directly from Ortex and it got instantly deleted for some reason? I also tried reaching out to all the mods on the topic because other people have complained about the same issue, and got no response."

2021-06-21 11:46:38,wallstreetbets,"I’m not one for conspiracy especially for a meme stock like GME, but the lack of dates is what people should be questioning. If we look at overall history, then yes of course it’s obvious that GME has a lot of approval because what other stock on the graphic had daily threads that hit popular on a weekly basis? 

However, even I noticed the lack of GME posts relative to the other ones. I could be wrong but I’m assuming most of the disapproved DD posts might be higher in the last month for GME as compared to others."
2021-06-21 04:10:40,wallstreetbets,I agree but this isn't  a one stock sub atm? I was in that stock until it hit 64 for the 3rd time. I like that I made profits but I'd love some new plays instead of hearing the same one and squeeze in every post that never comes. I love a bandwagon don't get me wrong but our own system is a bit broken atm. The amount of buying power we have collectively seems under utilized. I like the idea of a voting system of verified members for a stock of the week.
2021-06-21 04:32:18,wallstreetbets,Eh I made 55% on it then bought back in the next day for the same average cost. I'd be happy if people pumped up the volume again. Lol

Also, can a homie get some flair? I always miss the posts that you fuckers hand it out on. Don't care what it is, just fuck my shit up."
2021-06-21 11:24:36,wallstreetbets,"As a long time lurker with a 6 month old account, I would be more than happy to have all accounts newer than January restricted from posting or commenting in the sub. I know you guys are working hard behind the scenes, but even as a viewer of the sub I see so many newer accounts that do nothing but post boilerplate pump comments and are blatantly obvious astroturf accounts. You look at their post histories and it’s dozens or hundreds of low/no effort comments per day."

That being said, it seemed very sus that GME fell off the face of the earth nearly overnight on WSB. I initially thought WSB was compromised or whatever, but I didn't give a shit enough to brigade or protest because my online pals ended up being robots. ^(Although you have to admit, lots of low quality) *^(short squeeze potential)* ^(stocks popped up after GME seemed to quiet down)

&#x200B;

All this to say, I hope this isn't a WSB vs SS thing. I hope I can parttake in speculative bets and post my loss porn on here, while simultaneously believing in a short squeeze thesis with GameStop."

I saw it first hand a few weeks back where CLOV posts were removed immediately. Damn good ones too."

2021-06-21 10:43:47,wallstreetbets,I've a good feeling about this one
2021-06-21 00:08:03,wallstreetbets,So the red and teal are false and the dark blue is true. I see
2021-06-21 13:50:14,wallstreetbets,I liked how those went tho. Puts gang made an impressive call and then everyone piled on late and got roasted. Tanker gang just was pretty funny. AMC and GME will eventually be what Puts gang was simply because there will always be people buying at the top. I've got no clue about BB. Company is kinda shit but with potential so I won't say it will collapse.
2021-06-21 09:18:38,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.  I was around for the early internet crazes like Camelot.  I made some money with the crazy gyrations but I knew what I was buying was not worth anything.   There was another I can't remember the name.  Its products were supposed to include a Bluetooth toaster.  

My fear here is novice investors believe all the misinformation and wild assumptions.   I am long AMC because it has made me a nice profit but I am 100 percent certain:

1.  Not all retail investors are holding.

2.  Not all shares will ever be bought to cover.

3.  We can't set our own floor....see 1 and 2

4.  You will be holding a $10 stock if you wait too long.

I fear for the guy who knows nothing about this and actually invests his life savings and listens to the to the moon until it is too late.  That trader was relying on others and gets burned.   If I lose mine, it was all house money buying in at 9.25.  I knew the risks."

I wonder if getting something like that to identify the key phrases in the post, and then punching those into Google searches with quotes (to get exact matches only) and then just doing an old fashioned find() check on any hits' raw HTML, would give any sort of results.

Sounds like a PITA to setup though."
2021-06-21 05:45:11,wallstreetbets,It certainly does - my time in Uni has taught me there are many services that provide that; and some of them are free.

2. Well, when you see the claims, then hop on WSB and search for posts containing the stock and find one post for every few hours, yet the stock is very active in other social apps/subreddits, then it’s not just feelings guiding at that point. 

3. Huh?

Yeah buddy, this one is kinda hard to prove that there’s malice intent. But obviously it’s happening enough for this mod to make this nice pie chart for us to look at."

2021-06-20 21:56:01,wallstreetbets,"1. Literally the point of moderation. No shit. 

2. So your evidence is the social engagement levels? (One post every few hours). I mean, sorry - people here are drawn more naturally to stocks that are ballooning - see AMC, GME, etc. That’s the nature of how this works. 

3. It’s not difficult. You offer a postulate saying ‘Things are being deleted. I don’t understand why are things deleted?’ Then make the case ‘I understand why things are deleted - but I have no evidence it really happened.’

So your bottom claim is since a Mod, driven by data and impartiality - decides to dispel your claims as anecdotal drivel, you take that as evidence that ‘there’s something clearly wrong because he did the work.’

Got it. See how far that attitude gets you in life - and stay far the fuck away from legal practice. Believe it or not, people like to have data and reason for making decisions and fact check claims. That’s what the mod here is (and always has) done. Period."

2021-06-20 20:09:59,wallstreetbets,PLTR's only focus is making products or software other companies can't. They don't try to make profits and all of their insiders are constantly dumping massive amounts of shares. I've been holding it for about 6 months. The only profit I have seen is from selling calls.

They could cut all there r&d and show a “profit”.  What new investors dont realize is if they do that now just to show a profit, in 10 years when a company that was spending massive on rd and marketing is doing 25b but the company who wanted “profits” is making 8b because they did6
spend the money required. 

I am 1000000% with them not showing a profit if they keep growing at 30-40% yoy, the profits and share buybacks will come when they are doing 10b a year."

Once the Infrastructure bill hopefully gets passed, money will go into more climate change solutions for our nation. As we head to 2023, I expect the worse might be upon us.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GNRC ⚡️⚡️ DD with 40k calls YOLO **Intro:** Hello fellow autists. I, along with many of you, am sick and tired of the worthless PnD and fake short squeeze DD that has overtaken our beloved home. I am presenting a play that is **not** a short squeeze candidate, **not** a pump n dump candidate, and **not** some barely 1b market company I'm hoping WSB can move. This is a rock solid company entering a demand spiked growth phase that could see a 40-50% rally between now and eoy, whether WSB is on board or not.

(TLDR at the bottom)

**GNRC -**

**1. Silently taking over the solar market.**

**2. Will benefit from power strain caused by what is becoming the hottest summer ever.**

**3. Will benefit from an expectedly wild hurricane season**

**Fundamentals:** Boring shit, Keep scrolling if you want. One thing is certain. This company makes a fuck load of money, especially in comparison to their small market cap. Their EPS sits at 7.12, and their P/e ratio is around 50x. These may seem underwhelming, but GNRC competes with solar companies. For comparison, $RUN PE: 0x EPS: -.83 $SEDG PE:101x EPS: 2.4 Basically, GNRC makes lots of money selling generators and has ample cash flow to expand their solar market share against competitors that make no money. Fully manufactured here in the US. All parts and components are made and developed in house. No chinese trade bs to worry about.

**Recent Rapid Growth:** Generac Holdings net income for the quarter ending March 31, 2021 was $149 million, a **235.12% increase year-over-year. Gross sales q1 2021 up 70%** to $807 million compared to $476 million q1 of 2020. Thats a lot of fucking growth

**Massive growth potential:** 4x projected growth over the course of 3-5 years (per company earnings releases). There is currently a 4-6 month back log, meaning a fuck ton of generators are being ordered, and production must ramp up to meet demand. To meet this demand, Generac is expanding manufacturing out of Wisconsin with a new manufacturing plant in South Carolina, completion expected in Q3 2021. The spike in orders will be reflected in future earnings.

**Demand spike:** In addition to the solar boom, hurricane season is fucking coming. We’ve already seen the idiots in Texas lose all their power, and hopefully the dumb fucks like me in Florida and other hurricane states are taking notes. The answer to power outages? More fucking generators.

**Example:** The tropical storm over the weekend has left hundreds of thousands of houses without power. Missouri had nearly 50k houses lose power.

**Example:** California power companies used power cuts this weekend due to the fire hazards and heat waves. They will continue to do this to avoid another disaster like last year.

**Housing market:**  Unless you live in your mom’s basement you probably know the housing market is booming. California is basically requiring new homes to be built with solar panels and offering 10s of thousands of dollars in rebate if they buy home solar/generator systems. The PwrCell (Generac's version of the tesla power wall) is the best in terms of efficiency and power. In Texas, ERCOT is basically forcing people to buy home generators and solar systems. **Rolling blackouts** are being used to curb energy usage, so if you don't have a home generator then you lose power once a week. Get Generac or get fuked i guess. Is that bullish for all solar companies? Yes, but Generac makes the fucking best home solar system. Better than tesla. (we’ll get to that), and can actually afford (unlike other solar companies) to meet demand.

**Lack of competition:** there's two types of competition. One is solar companies, aka broke not profitable companies with massive expenses. Then there's the other competition, boomer shit like Cummins and black and decker, who compete to be the knock-off option in the generator sector. None of these companies specialize in generators, and none are in the solar market. Generac is its own fucking thing, positioned to make money from boomer shit like machinery, and future shit like solar.

**Merger and acquisitions:** GNRC acquired Deep Sea Electronics Jun 1: Deep Sea Electronics is one of the world’s top manufacturers of generator controllers, automatic transfer switch controllers, battery chargers and vehicle & off-highway controllers. Deep Sea Electronics employs over 160 people across four continents and sells products to over 150 countries direct from their UK head office through a comprehensive distributor network. With a foothold in the UK, this opens the door for **expansion out of the U.S.**

**Key Product in demand:** **the GENERAC “PwrCell”** is the most customizable, and therefore affordable solar battery backup system. PwrCell offers up to 13Kw- can store up to 6 batteries (for variability purposes), charge is actually insanely faster, more energy conservative, and overall cheaper to install.

For comparison: Tesla’s solar unit can only provide up to 7 Kw of battery backup, is 250 lbs, and has only one model (you would have to purchase multiple tesla units in order for it to actually power a home, making it insanely expensive- installers are moving away from product because not many people can afford it and they are chunky to install making labor much more). It’s actually a bitch and a half to install… I've been told.

**Analysts fucking love it:** many raised Pts, many from 400-410, some 410+. (These 400+ price targets were stated BEFORE acquisition of Sea Electronics. Price target jumps will continue as raters take global expansion into account.) 80% buy ratings, 20% hold ratings, 0 sell ratings.

90% shares are held by the institution, with a 4:0 ratio of insider buying to insider selling. (it means 4 insiders are buying for every 0 insider selling.  Executives are fucking buying, maybe they know something?)

**TA:** 4 months of consolidation, \~25b market cap. **Ready for the next growth phase.**

**My yolo position: \~40k in jan 400c**

**TLDR: Generac ($GNRC)** has been growing rapidly despite share consolidation, and is ready to break out on a summer bull run. Generac is poised to benefit greatly from the hot temperatures of summer, hurricanes, power strain, and housing boom. Demand for Generac products has never been higher. They make the best home solar/power system, and can afford to meet production and turn significant profit. Additionally, they’re close to completion on a new manufacturing plant in South Carolina (expected q3 2021), and have acquired a UK company to spur expansion out of the U.S. Q1 was a massive earnings and growth beat. Generac is Charged Up for a run to tendieland."

2021-06-21 09:30:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’m with some of the people here regarding it being overvalued. Revenue seems solid, but it’s already trading at a P/E ratio of 52.19x which is pretty insane. They’re overvalued by 48%, the “fair value” is $260 but it’s trading at $387. The industry average P/E is 26.8x, this stock is literally trading at double that. Seems like a great company, good growth, it is a bit high on debt as well but nothing insane. I think this stock might very well be overvalued and if inflation hits we could see a big impact to sales as well. The DD is great though 👌"

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"An update from a crazy mostly-options trader This is an update to [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b7qz14/ok_wsb_heres_some_gain_and_loss_porn_for_you_all/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from a couple of years ago in which I lost over $50k and then, at the time of posting, had almost made it all back.  What has happened since then?  All kinds of crazy shit.  (So it goes with options.)

Similarly to back then, I now have an impressive 1 month chart and not-so-impressive all-time chart, so I thought it was a fitting time to give an update.

&#x200B;

[1 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/4wrwsgcnbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5efada36b1d7ce9648acad0590a85431efbe3d8)

After I made my post, my account shot up to nearly +$90k.  I actually think it went over $90k, but Robinhood's all-time chart isn't very exact on the numbers.  (Side note: one thing I want to mention about these charts is that the percentages are not accurate according to my account value at the time because I have been depositing over the years... For example, when I was +$90k here, that was actually around a 200% gain at the time, not a 92% gain.)

&#x200B;

[My all-time high](https://preview.redd.it/hoqqy1ptbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36b8115cbe938a2d0fa2ec3b66aa7812dc296e76)

How did I get so many gains?  Well, this was a long time ago, and I make hundreds of trades per year, so I will just focus on some of the highlights in this post and hopefully that'll be good enough for the mods.  My biggest gains during this time were $AMZN calls prior to the 2020 crash and $INO calls and $SPY puts during the crash.

Here's a screenshot I took of one of my $AMZN positions:

Well, I'm sure you saw that my gains didn't last, and I imagine you're thinking I lost them all during the 2020 crash.  Yes and no.  As I mentioned, I made a lot of money on SPY puts during the crash (I likely didn't screenshot these because it was a bunch of small, quick trades).  I actually only made money during the initial crash and completely dodged that bullet.  So what did happen?  Well, after the stock market rebounded significantly from the bottom, I bet heavily that it would go back down.  And well, as you know, it didn't.  So I lost all of my massive gains to $TSLA and $SPY puts after the rebound only kept going up.  I managed to find a screenshot of some of those losses:

&#x200B;

[Some SPY put losses 4\/8\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/q6xvm1hdch671.jpg?width=1426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db354d6bb5cea7b9dd4b081ee2abc9bf57d6da45)

Once I lost all of my gains, I just sold everything and took a break from risky trading.  You can see the chart is mostly sideways for 6 months before it plummets again.  This plummet I lost over $60k, even more than my old losses that I crawled back from.

&#x200B;

[New all-time low](https://preview.redd.it/3d30zf4vdh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2da69f1e157782c71906ab00e39a701006ccf2c3)

So how did I get those massive losses again?  Well, in late 2020/early 2021 I lost to $TSLA puts and $GME calls.  Both of these were good buys, I just sold them too soon.  My TSLA puts were bought when TSLA was over $800, but I got impatient and sold a few weeks before it would've made me money.  GME... Well, I don't want to talk about GME.  I sold just before it went crazy.  My position would have made me a millionaire.  I took a screenshot of my position before I sold because I had a feeling I would regret it.

&#x200B;

[GME position 12\/9\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/zknq2bklch671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6ac53d8bbc8970c5c322b4ae27d68ede8ea613d)

I bought in on the GME squeeze thesis posted here in WSB, and I still believed in it at the time I sold.  But I had commented here that I was in on it, and I started to worry about the legality of it and decided it wasn't worth it.  What an idiotic decision.

The TSLA puts and GME calls weren't actually the majority of my losses, though.  That honor goes to my next position, $PFE calls.  This was actually another well-timed buy that went wrong because I sold too soon.   I bought PFE almost exactly at the bottom in late Feb stock-wise, but as the stock kept rising, my options kept deteriorating.  Eventually, I couldn't handle watching my options and account fall to near zero while the stock kept rising, and I gave up and sold.  Had I held on another week, I would have made all of my money back.  Another 2 weeks, and I would have had big gains.  I didn't screenshot this disaster and would have to dig through my history for details, but I feel like no one would care to have these details.  Suffice to say it was about 1,000 call options the decayed despite upward stock movement.

And thankfully, I made back all of my losses anyway, as you can see from my all-time chart.  After all of my disasters, I decided I was done with short-term trading and was just going to invest via LEAPs in some high growth companies.  So I did some DD and bought LEAPs on companies I thought were undervalued, most notably $SPCE, $XPEV, and $WISH.  I bought these planning to hold long term and didn't expect these would rocket higher immediately after I bought them.

I didn't screenshot full positions, but here are some of the trades in my history if you feel you need proof for the recent gains.

&#x200B;

[SPCE buys](https://preview.redd.it/fr4u3i62dh671.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=9019221417f56ce97cb827ae25540d2c18820cd8)

&#x200B;

[XPEV buys](https://preview.redd.it/6vhafze8dh671.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc543ee9d002978c3ba8e75bff0c7ff682fbf5e1)

&#x200B;

[XPEV sells](https://preview.redd.it/pco0yzy9dh671.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb209ac22850b9a5f3fab10029ca2eea2347a5a3)

&#x200B;

[WISH gains](https://preview.redd.it/doe68wjgdh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826e8870c8389a81aa95ee2dab83ce5df38e864c)

(I made more money than is shown in these screenshots; again, they're not the full positions.)

I also liked someone's DD here of $CLOV, and decided to take a small position in CLOV as well.  This screenshot is just before selling, so luckily I held onto these gains:

&#x200B;

[$4.5k into $31k.  Nuts.](https://preview.redd.it/dm35dtkldh671.jpg?width=1437&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3593cc7ecb91f46b4455ff8fa8655f4ef8652d7)

I closed most of these positions.  So where am I now?

Actually, I'm back heavily in $WISH.  Here's my current WISH position:

&#x200B;

[WISH current position](https://preview.redd.it/g0hywmp2eh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a08b1cf153dae3812d85292e5e7b06e9045a4f4)

(These screenshots are from Thursday but they're close to the same value now).  I could go into detail telling you why I like WISH so much right now, but there are plenty of DD posts to be found.  What it boils down to is that this thing is still at less than half of its IPO value, and I think it's severely oversold for a growing e-commerce site, regardless of what some people might think of the products.  You think the quality of products is too cheap to be successful, I'll just kindly point you in the direction of $DG and its chart.  Note I bought a lot of WISH shares here even though I don't usually buy shares.  The premium on WISH options is a bit high, and I'm trying to chill out a bit after my massive unexpected gains this last month.

I also have smaller positions in $ACAD, $AYX, $QS, and $RUN.  I like a lot of other stocks right now, but I just have my money tied up currently.  For example, I want to start new positions in $PLTR, $OPEN, $SNOW, $F, $AEVA, and $VIEW when I get a chance.  I also want to get back in $SPCE and $XPEV if I get a dip, as well as hoping for a dip in some others like $DIS and $DDD, and a ton of other companies whose stocks are just too expensive for me at the current moment.  I also don't think you'd be wrong to be into metals, especially nickel.  Hopefully I haven't mentioned any banned tickers here.  There are a lot of multibagger opportunities out there right now, imo, assuming hyperinflation and rising interest rates + QT don't cause a massive bear market, of course.

Although I feel like I'm decent at this, I also felt like I was decent at it before I lost $150k in 2020 and 2021 from high to low.  To be fair to myself, the measures the government and Fed took to prop up the market/economy were unprecedented when I bought those SPY puts, and most of the recent losses on TSLA and PFE were good buys but bad sells (i.e, sold too early).  But that doesn't change that I ultimately made a bad trade.  Anyway, you can ask me for options or trading advice and I'll try to answer, but honestly right now I'm still not feeling the most qualified.

One last thing, a lot of people down $50k (which was like 90% of my account at the time) or my recent $65k losses would have thrown in the towel on options completely.  I'm proof you can turn it around... I've done it twice now.  That said, I'm also proof that you can lose it all quickly in the options world.  I wouldn't advise most people to do this.  I have separate retirement funds, college funds for my children, and make a decent living with a relatively secure job.  I would be okay if I lost it all.  This is just me trying to win a ticket to early retirement.  But don't do it if you can't afford to lose it."

2021-06-21 01:13:17,wallstreetbets,"I also would've been a millionaire off GME but fucked up.  
Then I went to options, and wound up writing sideways calls on AMC b/c Fidelity says you need experience to get options. So I missed out on getting at least $100,000.  
And now I have gone back to RobinHood, which I initially passed on b/c it's impossible to set up on PC... though thankfully it finally works on PC if you set it up via ipad.  


So much fucking money I've missed out on, but at least I've stayed sideways. Wakeup call to be more careful was wondering if I could get my IRA account to trade options... then I remembered that's my fucking *retirement* account, not goddamn play money, so I've backed off and missed out on nothing since. Trying to reduce my overall investments and figure out how much I can *really* afford to lose/play with versus the YOLO I got into with $40k savings.  


This sub both inspired me into trading, brings me joy, and leaves me thankful I haven't gone and tanked like some posts have, while also giving me hope that I can take a smaller, safer sum, and make something of it."

2021-06-20 21:07:28,wallstreetbets,"That's a tough one because there have been a lot of lessons.  But I would say: to not be afraid of the gains you might miss out on by selling or by not taking a bigger position.  There are always other opportunities, and you shouldn't become personally attached to a stock or afraid of being wrong.  In fact, better to assume you are wrong and have a plan in place for when it comes true.

I don't know if that was one lesson or several, but it all boils down to not becoming stuck or attached to a particular stock/company."

2021-06-20 23:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Problem is the supposed savings I'd get from another broker on fills are intangible and unquantifiable.  Maybe if I had some hard data to go off of, I'd make the switch, but right now all I have is anecdotal evidence.  And because I'm placing limit orders within the bid-ask spread and can see the volume and most recent fills, I tend to believe switching brokers wouldn't make an appreciable difference on my options fills.

However, that 0.65 I save per contract on RH is quantifiable and appreciable.  I trade thousands of contracts per year (my PFE position was 2,000 contracts alone), so I know that I am saving thousands of dollars by trading options on RH."

2021-06-21 00:14:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I haven't been involved in AMC at all.  To be honest, I tend to avoid WSB when I have huge losses because all of the gains posts depress me when my account is deep red.  So I think I missed most of the hype with AMC, as I had massive PFE losses at the time, and I never really read the DD on it.  I did know it was a thing, but I guess I assumed hedge funds wouldn't make the same mistakes as GME and never looked into the details.  I still haven't really read the DD, to be honest; I've just been assuming I missed the boat already.  I definitely could be wrong on that, but I don't plan on jumping in at this point."
2021-06-21 01:44:20,wallstreetbets,"Sorry to hear man.  I'd say at least we aren't alone in our misery, but I'd really rather we just both be millionaires.

I've done the wondering about options in my IRA thing, too, but luckily, I'd have to get approved for it first, and I ultimately decided to intentionally never apply for options so I'm not tempted.  I did decide to start picking stocks for it, though, rather than put it in a mutual fund... Even that makes me a little nervous since it's meant to be my retirement.

Good luck man."

You’re back into Wish you said too? Can I ask for your thought process on that one? 

Seems like high reward/risk ratio at these price levels, so I like that, but the service feels worthless to me. The company won’t be profitable for another 1-2 years, even if their MAU keeps increasing, which I feel will stagnate sooner rather than later. Plus they spend 75% of their revenue on marketing currently.  Is there a demographic component of this I’m missing? 

I would like to take a chance here because the sentiment is so high. Looking for any reason to give it a shot. I’m currently in $WKHS as my momentum/squeeze play."

2021-06-20 23:13:42,wallstreetbets,"It's not supposed savings. RH literally makes money selling order flow and you don't get best execution. Let's use your example, bid/ask is 0.10/0.15, and you bid market price. You bet on RH you will get filled at 0.15. On fidelity you might get filled at 0.12, that is a $3 savings per contract, well worth the $0.35 you would pay for commission. 

I have used multiple brokers, you would save much more than 0.65 per contract based on fills alone. If you don't believe me, open an account at any other legit broker, trade a small position on both accounts and tell me you don't get better fills. The savings are VERY obvious on large bid/ask spreads."

2021-06-20 23:50:31,wallstreetbets,"I try to get as close to 1 year as I can.  To be honest, if my account grows, I will probably buy shorter dated options more regularly... I'm a little more carefree with my profit money, although my experience tells me never to go less than 6 months unless I just feel like gambling / buying a lotto ticket.

If my stock isn't moving up faster than theta is decaying within a few months, it's time to re-evaluate, and roll out my contracts if I still like the story, or sell 'em and move on if I'm having doubts.

I haven't done the math on capital efficiency, but I imagine that's largely dependent on how good you are at picking a good stock at the right time.  If you're terrible at it, you probably want longer dated options. If you're great at it, go for the shorter dates.  If you think it's all just a coin flip... buy stock instead of options; it's honestly not worth the stress if you don't think there's any skill involved, unless you're just in it for the fun."

2021-06-20 22:08:40,wallstreetbets,"I can't really vouch for the long-term sustainability of WISH.  That's going to depend on whether management can execute.  So far, they have executed pretty well, but I tend to agree with others that the platform seems terrible.  It's not for me, at least.  There are certainly demographics that like cheap products and their revenue has been growing, but I do believe they'll have to improve it to survive long term.

That sort of long term sustainability doesn't really concern me, though.  I'm in it for a trade, not an investment.  My thesis is that it's currently severely undervalued *based on current available information* and also that the current hype, short covering, and bullish analyst sentiment should drive the price significantly higher before the next ER as long as no more bad material information comes out. Additionally, IV should continue to grow as ER approaches.

There is a good chance I sell all of my options before ER, win or lose.  Whether or not I keep the shares will depend on the current price and any new material information that might have come out before then."

For all those who don’t know about it yet Cristiano Ronaldo had two bottles of coke in front of him when he was about to speak in a press conference, when he noticed them he put them away and he looked really annoyed for the presence of those two coke bottles.

After that the Coca-Cola stock closed at 3.745B the last Friday.

So now that its price dropped I just wonder if it’s a good time for buying some stocks from this company or if it would be better to wait."

- Sugar is the new tobacco.
- Sugar-driven obesity is growing exponentially.
- Even their “healthy” juice products have a shit ton of sugar.
- Diet/non sugar substitutes are shitty chemicals…and science claims these shit chemicals actually increases real sugar cravings.

What’s left in their current portfolio? Water

This is a dying company.

What could turbocharge their future portfolio? THC

I’m not untested in this dumpster fire…unless they start selling THC beverages."

They are an enterprise and can operate any way they see fit. If I don't agree with their operational activities I don't support them.

How is this different from not supporting companies who willingly harm the environment or refuse to remove employees involved in sexual harassment or racism.

Several sources have stated things such as ""The slides included tips to learners on how to be ""less white, less arrogant, less certain, less defensive, less ignorant and more humble.""

I do not support their operational philosophy, I will not buy their products. Hence I will not invest."

2021-06-20 21:17:02,wallstreetbets,"The yield curve is flattening at a rather dramatic pace. It only does that when the credit/bond market believes inflation is going to be less than the yield in the long run. Why would they think that? Don't they believe in the strong economic growth story or the inflation story? Guess not. If the flattening continues, it only suggests an economy in distress. Right now it is far from being *flat* flat. But certainly deserves a hard look for weeks to come.

My guess is the bond market feels the Fed is cornered. The system can't take anymore liquidity, something that can be confirmed with ever increasing reverse repo exchanges recently. Fed can't continue to do QE or have zero percent interest rates for a long time. It is in a race against time to achieve its employment goal before it is forced to tighten monetary policy. Doesn't really paint a picture of a healthy economy.

TLDR: we are close to peak liquidity conditions. Which means, the market is fast running out of fuel to keep going higher."

**Its an ass, but not just any ass, it was god's ass.**

He heard her prayers and he was mooning the market.

But this instant 20 point S&P futures recovery means the buying pressure is there, especially in big tech. CHADSDAQ futures green. SPY $420 by close tomorrow is likely, unless its a bull trap, then I’m fucked lmao. Looks like putting money into AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, SHOP, etc might be the best play. I picked AMD. I like the stock, the swole underdog play with new catalysts. But that’s just me. Oh, and ABNB. I live in a big city. It’s been a ghost town until recently. Now there’s tourists everywhere. 

It all depends what James Bullard has to say tomorrow. Don’t fuck this up James. 2023. Not 2022. Get it right. Wait… is he speaking tomorrow? I never know with these FED 🤡s. If not for the TDA news ticker I wouldn’t know half this shit. Still trying to find a better ticker. And trying to find out how to add a high/low ticker to TDA. Maybe I should switch to etrade. 

Other catalysts- over the weekend, AAL had many cancellations. Like 400 or so. Puts on them. They have so much debt too. But they are “too big to fail” so maybe I wouldn’t hold puts for very long. Idk. I’m an amateur, def not financial advice.

Canada won’t open the border fully for a while. Investors might throw a tantrum over that also. Not sure if that affects commodities, I know we get a shit ton of lumber from them. But likely it doesn’t. Trees can’t carry Covid. Just emerald ash bore. 

Finally banks might be fucked on the 30th of June. We’ll see. WFC options still cheap. These 4+million upcoming evictions don’t seem to be scaring anybody so somebody please tell me why, and what’s propping up the rental companies? 

Ok whatever. Goodnight my dudes. If you’re worried about what to do in the morning, maybe try a straddle. That way, you always win. Usually. Sometimes. 50% of the time, works every time."

2021-06-20 22:26:46,wallstreetbets,"I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined."

The only thing driving asset prices up around the world has been the continuous supply of cash by way of bond purchases, thus depriving the financial sector of quality collateral and forcing them to seek it elsewhere (lending). Looking at the reverse repo market in the US recently, $500BN (that’s right, half a trillion dollars) could not find a better home than 0.0% in short term overnight bonds. The fed increased this to 0.05% last week and the number increased to $750BN.

2021-06-21 02:02:32,wallstreetbets,Yields (interest rates) are dropping on 10y treasury bonds.  At the same time yields on shorter term 2y are rising.  Yields move opposite to price so that means people are selling their shorter dated bonds for longer dated ones.  It's a risk off move.
2021-06-21 01:59:29,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-21 02:04:58,wallstreetbets,Interest rates are whatever you interpret them to be. For instance we dont want the 10yr to hit 1.38. I dont wanna scare anyone but if it does that then man...lets just say...i wouldnt want to eat salmon.

Obviously every person on this sub just spams bullish so most people have zero idea that the numbers will probably be peckish. I'm also assuming they will have an update on Ivy, patent sale and Spark sales. It'll be fascinating to see how it plays out. Can a company on a decades long revenue decline with sales hamstrung by QNX show growth and promise going forward. I bailed a while ago because it's down 80% of the time on ERs and I don't need my pp slapped when I'm holding oil companies. But rooting for you guys.

2021-06-21 09:02:23,wallstreetbets,"Wyckoff Distributions are fractal in nature. You can see it when you imaginarily add the same pattern again, bigger, and ""zoom out"".

A significant, probably the *most* significant, question is if we're already at the end of the top, or if it's going up one more time. Given that there's a high possibility of stocks shooting up before the downfall, it's more likely we haven't reached the top yet.

By ""we"" I mean all of us who've put money into *anything*.

https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method

The question I am referring to is: Are we at the end of UT, or UTAD?"

Beijing factory ramping to full capacity (already producing cars, but not at 100% speed)

Texas factory starting production

Berlin starting production

Cyber Truck rollout

4680 battery rollout (resulting in better all around performance/range/charging)

With those factories starting, you'll see production numbers jump, and with that, sales/revenue/profit (not in percents but in multiples) starting Q1 2022.

The biggest drag on Earnings Per Share has been factory investment - with those factories built, you'll see EPS go bananas.

2021-06-21 07:35:56,wallstreetbets,Funny you should say this. When I sold TSLA these were my two moves. Buy NVDA and then later on buy AMD.

2021-06-20 23:50:03,wallstreetbets,"who doesn't (ok fine most don't). I bought my first AMZN when i saw the articles saying ""is this the end for amazon????"" in 2010-13 which i knew was a huge buy signal since someone was trying to scare retail off.

I also bought TSLA on rumors it might go bankrupt from being shorted.

Every time a corporate mouthpiece tell me something is a bad idea, I do just that and cash in. Nobody will write an article about how some unknown company is ACTUALLY going nowhere. If someone is talking about it in bad, now is your time to buy, since everybody dumb is selling.

Now i'm mostly day/swing trading. And everytime i hear x is the future, I sell just after retail surges in."

2021-06-21 08:43:02,wallstreetbets,Only reason I think he may not be in the green yet is he started advertising that he's short on Tesla when it was sub 600 before it ran to 900. He may be in the green but he definitely jumped in too early.
2021-06-21 08:41:17,wallstreetbets,If he loaded up when it was under 600 and advertised it. Then it ran to 900 then he only advertised again when it was back at 600 it isn't unreasonable to assume he's not yet in the green. Maybe he is.. but you or I don't know. What we do know is he started shorting tsla too early.
2021-06-21 00:10:52,wallstreetbets,Then short it
2021-06-21 04:44:07,wallstreetbets,Lmfao I love the P/E argument. Truly retarded.
2021-06-21 01:04:44,wallstreetbets,Who remembers...checks notes*...last quarter when it was 1000 p/e. I'm sure p/e couldn't possibly drop again with another record quarter.
2021-06-21 07:17:50,wallstreetbets,500s != 500
2021-06-20 22:29:13,wallstreetbets,I'm 100% sure he didn't catch the grossly undervalued TSLA in 2020 like I did

If it's $100 Puts those are cheap AF vs. the ""value"" being pumped by mainstream headlines via 100x[TSLA SHARE PRICE AT THE TIME].

Put it this way: This AM bought 100 call options for $1.00. Is this worth $10,000 ($1 * 100 * 100) or $6.23 million (100 * 100 * [tsla price today])? 

CNBC and their sketchy explanation of SEC filings wants you to think it's $6.23 million, but your bank account would show it at $10,000. 

The fact that CNBC writes it up as $500M value doesn't strike you as odd? That's because it's the weird way the SEC handles the filings, but CNBC (financial markets media) doesn't adjust for that?. Headlines aren't here to inform us. They getting play us like a skinflute at a truck stop, my mans."

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Market Perspective: Recent Trends and Performance in Charts Strap in, this is gonna be a long one. A lot happened this week, yet despite all the turmoil the SPY closed down less than %3 on the week, IWM a little worse off at under %4 and QQQ about unchanged. As we’ll discuss, there’s a different story lurking beneath the surface and it’s questionable just how much this volatility can be contributed to the Fed’s comments on Wednesday.

###Fed Reaction

At the risk of being labelled a Fed apologist, I have to ask what were people expecting? Those recently screeching about inflation risks should be happy: [the Fed has taken note](https://www.ft.com/content/0bf83e29-5ee2-415e-9e03-0edb38218bf3), though sticking to the narrative (seemingly supported by the bond market) that it’s transitory, they are guiding for possible rate hikes in 2023, two years from now. Though this view could change in the coming months as supply chain issues resolve and data “normalizes”, this recent adjustment in guidance shows that the Fed seems to be acknowledging current data and willing to quickly adjust it’s long-term view.  
Like, what more do you people want? This is not a bad thing, and given their current intention is to create some inflation (but not too much), I think they’ve been dead-on in their approach.

###Market Reaction

From a market perspective we had two catalysts this week: the Fed notes on Wednesday and a [quarterly Opex on Friday that involved a massive gamma roll-off](https://spotgamma.com/quad-witching-gamma-pinning/). Both caused noise in the markets and I think it’s important to understand what affected what in order to have an understanding of what to watch in the next week or two.  
To do so, we’ll need to look at the reflation trade that’s recently been in vogue, bonds, and index action.

So, let’s dive in to the charts…

#Charts

Sector Performance  


[Sector Compare 1y](https://imgur.com/OFVxgbz)

[Sector Compare 1m](https://imgur.com/PWNNCE8)  


The last week has marked a significant downturn in certain sectors, specifically those of the reflation trade: XLI, XLF, XLE, IWM all took big hits this week. Zooming in on the chart adds to this story: since the volatility in mid-May they’ve been flat and underperforming with downward momentum picking up into June. All that time, unprofitable growth stocks (represented by ARKK) have been on the up. 

###Reflation Trade Breakdown?  


[XLF 1y](https://imgur.com/hzxcNLl)

[XLI 1y](https://imgur.com/gGn5LWE)

[BCI 1y](https://imgur.com/V4z58Ln)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/Lwbe1W2)

For a few weeks now the reflation trade has seemingly stalled. Wednesday and Thursday, quite obviously attributed to the Fed’s commentary, this trade had a major breakdown. Commodities, represented by BCI, which tracks the Bloomberg Commodities / BCOM index, sold off alongside major reflation themes in financials and industrials. Energy slid as well, and IWM (small caps) followed through on that failed breakout. 

Looking to bonds, US10Y yields shot up post-announcement and then came right back down:

[TNX 5d](https://imgur.com/j3QUKm7)

But, the action in the 30Y/5Y spreads is what’s most telling, as they got absolutely hammered (flattened) indicating that _“…investors are pulling back on expectations of inflation remaining sticky and are beginning to price in a more benign inflation outlook in line with the Fed’s forecast of a transitory or temporary increase in inflation…”_ (source is marked as spam):

[US30Y less US05Y](https://imgur.com/uSb5asf)

So suddenly the market is realizing the Fed is actually going to react to continued “bad” data (inflation-wise; exactly what we mentioned above) and is pricing that in.

###Opex Volatility

Contrary to the action above, SPY and QQQ held up Wednesday into Thursday and then had moves to the downside Friday (though the latter held up well), which I think is more a result of the massive Gamma roll-off rather than reaction to the Fed.

###Takeaways: Summing It Up

The violent reaction to the Fed’s comments relative to bond spreads and the reflation trade I think is overdone (as usual). It is worrying that this trade has lost steam prior to this week, but the sudden pivot by markets to think that we won’t have any inflation does not line up with what the Fed has been indicating with it’s average inflation targeting - we’ve just gone from the markets thinking the Fed won’t be able to control or prevent runaway inflation to the Fed crushing any inflation at all (i.e. the last decade). I think we’re gonna be somewhere in the middle or the former: wage increases aren’t going to reverse and the Fed wants some inflation stickiness in the short-term - it’s a good thing!We’ll need to watch this trade for the next few weeks to see if it is truly done with or this is just a reactionary pullback.

The Gamma unwind sets us up for possible volatility, and downside risk remains. Analysts have been suggesting a pullback towards the %10 range for some time now, but markets have remained resilient overall. This could continue but the specter seems to loom larger the longer we go. Pullbacks are normally a healthy thing, and a buy-on-dip opportunity if we get one.

Overall, one or two days does not establish a trend and I think  we need to watch closely over the next week or two to see how things resume after this past week’s furor.

#Bonus Charts

In one of my previous posts I highlighted a possible breakout/breakdown in ATVI and APPL respectively and wanted to revisit these charts:

[ATVI 1y](https://imgur.com/rTFKb3d)

[AAPL 1y](https://imgur.com/feHpccF)

ATVI broke above my signal line at the $98-99 range and then immediately broke down [seemingly on news of a delay on a shareholder vote concerning the CEO’s pay package. Not a great look for the stock](https://www.ft.com/content/2049c3fc-bee9-490a-a317-f406a7419d57). 

Meanwhile, AAPL flirted with breaking below it’s 200DMA and then immediately reversed and established an upward trend. It’s hitting resistance around the $130 level, and I’d say we’d need to see this break out above the $135-136 level to be legit.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"FIVERR running back up to its ATH INTRO

What’s up retards. Immediate disclosure: this is my first DD and it won’t have a technical analysis. Based on current culture trends. If that’s not your speed, STOP reading here. No worries.

Here it goes: 

Workers are coming out of remote work as states (California most notably since that’s where most tech work is) are reopening. You’d think that this would be detrimental to companies such as Fiverr or UpWork, but it’s actually the other way around. 

Workers just spent a year indoors and they’re aching to get out of town. To travel, visit family, and to just go anywhere that isn’t home. While the perks of a full time job can be better than freelancing, many are not going to be willing to sacrifice a return to normalcy to continue to toil away for all the big tech companies out there in the world.

You know where I’m going with this: they’ll start freelancing. A little work here, a little more work there and they’ve got enough pocket change to fuel their summer experiences.

Plus, even before states were even thinking about reopening, Fiverr’s platform has seen a large influx of new freelancers looking for ways to make some extra cash on the side. And a large number of new companies registering to post jobs (with workers leaving they need to reach out to find new employees). So, at least to me, this is a win win for Fiverr. Worker leaving their job: likely to freelance to travel or something else, worker stays at job: freelances on the side for extra money, worker just spent a year out the workforce and is desperately pursuing all avenues of work: freelances as one of their options.

WHERE THIS MAKES YOU MONEY

FVRR has been trading well below it’s ATH since February, but has been increasing substantially by over 30% in the last month (I’d like to point out that 30% isn’t necessarily much compared to some other stocks previous month gains, but this just means that there’s still time to board the train). When did the beginning of this turnaround occur? In the beginning of May, when countries around the world have been begun to accept non-essential travel. I’d wager you’ve seen this happening without even realizing it. Influencers on Instagram moving around quite a bit more, co workers leaving their jobs and visiting countries close to home, friends and family taking more time to see each other in different countries (most applicable to Europeans).

Now, call options. July 16th is the main target. Currently it stands at $0.30 or $30 per contract. Cheap AF right?  But wait, it gets better. That cheap options strike price is $320, actually below the stocks ATH. What increase could you see if it were to get there? Take a look at a current options price for a call at a $230 strike price (stock stands at $225 at time of writing), it’s $12.30 or $1,230 for one contract. If FVRR would hit it’s ATH in the next month, that would represent over a 3000% increase in gains. And it’s already up 15% through last week. It didn’t give two fucks about the FED meeting one bit.

CONCLUSION

At the moment I did all of this DD my buying power only stood at $1000. With my funds wrapped up in other calls that I’ve now sold in anticipation of using them to buy more FVRR contracts.

So, current position is: 33 Contracts at a strike price of $320 expiring on July 16th. With the intent to buy another 30+ more on tuesday morning.

ALSO

I’m not shy to critique. I’ve never taken the time to post a DD before and I’m sure this one is lacking in WSB technicality. Sound off any improvements I need to work on in the comments below and I’ll edit the shit out of this post.

* The company enjoys fantastic margins which should lead to profitability without much struggle. Skillz has enough firepower to sustain several money-losing quarters without any dilution, regardless.
* Additionally, the stock is position greatly for a short squeeze based on its technicals, at a time when the Reddit army is actively looking for such opportunities.
* We are taking advantage of the increased volatility and high premiums to sell PUTs with the potential for massive returns.

&#x200B;

* The company generated 92% of revenue growth year-over-year, primarily as a result of 81% growth in paying monthly active users.
* The company enjoys gross margins of 94%, which indicates plenty of room for a rich bottom line as the company continues to scale.
* The company ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $613 million of cash.
* The company has no debt on its balance sheet to pressure its bottom line further.

Right now the company isn't profitable since they are in growth mode. Considering the fat gross margins, it should not struggle to turn green if the company pursues the profitability road.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NOK, Nokia's conducting a trial using its unique Liquid Cooling AirScale Baseband solution Nokia (NOK) announced that it is conducting a trial using its unique Liquid Cooling AirScale Baseband solution with Japanese mobile operator, KDDI. The trial will demonstrate how KDDI can reduce its baseband cooling system energy consumption by more than 70 percent compared to traditional gas coolant-based air-cooling solutions. Efficiencies can be further enhanced by the introduction of a heat reuse option that could yield a potential reduction of 80 percent in CO2 emissions. This is the first time a liquid cooling solution will be trialed in Japan highlighting KDDI's commitment to sustainability and combatting climate change.

I'm sure a lot of you already know this; however, I noticed that anytime a company uses ""combat climate change"" there has been an upward movement/momentum in most of these companies stocks. Especially when looking at Exxon Mobil (XOM). I got out of the stock because of who Blackrock (BLK) put on the board. Subsequently went up to $64, I took profits and $62. I changed my position to Marathon oil (MRO) as it is more reasonably priced $12.75 as of this post, pays a dividend, surprised in revenue and earnings. I hope they become more open to ""combating climate change"" and show more upward movement LOL

I know a lot of people do not like to talk about it, but it's definitely worth mentioning. I don't understand all hate for this company. I don't see any downside to this stock."

Just because new shits coming doesn't mean GOOD shits coming, GSKILL got more allocation of the better B-die RAM chips from Samsung when AM4 was rolling out, Corsair had way less RAM kits on the first gen QVL.

I'm not saying they wont make money, I have CRSR, and I use their products, but people need to stop thinking of DDR5 coming as a definite positive, it COULD be good, or they could be a step behind again."

You can have all the MHz in the world but if they are clocked at CL24 low CL DDR4 would be faster, hell speaking of speed what improvements will the memory controller see and what is the max speed that will retain 1:1:1, they could release a kit that's rated at 580000mhz but if the IFC maxes out at 560000 your paying more to go slower unless you manually adjust the speed or, again, the DOCP profile works and that's factored in.  

This is the shit I'm getting at and until one of the reporting agencies get their hands on a kit and do a write up its all smoke IMO.

Jan, the day before the Full Moon +300%.

Feb, 3 days b4 the Full Moon +18%.

March, the day before the Full Moon +21%.

April, the day before the Full Moon +13%.

May, 2 days before the Full Moon +13%, next day +19%, day of the Super/Perigee Full Moon Eclipse, +19%, next day +35%, 2 days later + 95%

# Next Super/Perigee Full Moon June 24th.

Every Waning Moon (gray background) we make a higher low.

Bull Runs during a Waxing Moon (starts on New Moons blue background) are ideal🔵

**What do you all think about this one?**

Before you comment check my work, it speaks for itself.

# For clarification, within 3 days we will more than likely get a big move. However many times it's a day or so before. As explained in the weekly update vids on AMC, I think the day of this Full Moon we have a shift of energy and I wouldn't be surprised if we rip b4 the Full and get a dip on the full. Keep in mind if we follow the historic moon phase pattern and make a new high low, we are good to go for the coming New Moon.

2021-06-21 07:56:48,wallstreetbets,"If I were going to pick up a second steel stock, it would probably be MT.  Went w CLF bc 1) its American & i am much more in tune w American landscape, and 2) CLF's CEO is a luminary

EDIT: third and maybe most importantly, I believe CLF is _the_ most undervalued American steel play. They vertically integrated in 2020 & this simultaneously transformed compny and temporarily wrecked their balance sheet. But it turns out they bought assets at the bottom of the market right before prices went insane. The CEO has already paid down almost half a billion in debt _in the first half of 2021_ - their cash flow is INSANE. Analysts are beginning to rapidly pick the stock up, but the 2020 acquistions is what let this fly under the radar and be available for this trade.  CLF has a LOT of room to run."

Have to be careful w short-term options. The market has been sleeping on steel. Steel stocks have been grinding up, but slowly bc people don't trust cyclicals until the party is roaring."
2021-06-21 08:33:38,wallstreetbets,"Yup, on my daily chart if the daily candle touched the bottom of the channel line (i actually have an ascending wedge drawn) it would be at about 19.00 worst case scenario."
2021-06-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HEAR ME OUT: WE SHORT EVERYTHING Let’s start with the obvious that everyone needs to be talking about; oil. 


The disconnect and overvaluation in oil futures is so fucking nonsensical that I would bet come Oct-Nov the average national US gas price will be in the 2.3-2.4 range, if not lower. The disconnect we’re seeing is something I’ve only found 2 other times in the last decade plus. The last time was in 2018. [In June the price average was 2.98, by Christmas and into early 2019 it sat 2.35-2.45.](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=m) Prior to 2018 it was 2008. A year in which the price of gas topped 4.11 avg. and by the end of the year was sitting in the 1.7-1.9 range, obviously the Great Recession contributed to it. Now here is 2021, the national average in May was 3.07 and the overvaluation is greater than 2018 but not as bad as 2007-2008 appeared. Food for thought.

&nbsp;

Next, the stock market is more overvalued than it has ever been. Ever. The [Total Market to GDP is 198% overvalued](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/60/ratio-of-wilshire-5000-over-gnp). For reference ‘Normal’ would be in the 95-120 range. If we look at the Top Stocks by Index weight the sign is not pretty. Tesla has begun it’s crack and it may just be a matter of weeks before its 50 Avg. falls below its 200 Avg. (for the dumb, that ain’t good.) Amazon and Apple have somewhat plateaued in recent months and show signs that a regress is in store. Basically the big weights holding this shit together is looking not good. We can take a look at the Dow and SP500 individually and it tells roughly the same story with the both taking a dump in the last few days.

&nbsp;


[The Fed has already begun to say the will not hike rates next year](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/feds-kashkari-opposed-to-rate-hikes-at-least-through-2023.html), we’re walking on egg shells and nobody anywhere is doing anything worthwhile to prepare for the worst. We’re using a condom we know has a hole in it we put there and know the partner isn’t on birth control. We’re playing with fire and about to get burnt, well poor people mostly because I’m sure they will take the majority of the blame with [the BS stories they’re pushing with UI benefits.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/07/truth-behind-unemployment-benefits-myth)

&nbsp;


Basically I am expecting over the course of the next year or so for the beginning of a recession on par with or worse than 2008. I believe 2020 will be looked at as the body ache before the actual flu sets in. The signs are all there and will just become solidified over the coming months. Early this year the war was on Short Sellers now it needs to be on the bullish and the greedy because they and the current system are going to fuck us all over even more. Just my two cents."
2021-06-20 23:30:48,wallstreetbets,"You don’t even mention the real economy at all, just some slight references to history. The economy is reopening, consumer demand is high, oil consumption is on the rise, Amazon is on the rise (they have the profits to back it up), yiu could argue a lower valued tesla is bullish for the overall markets, which have been trending sideways and look prime for the next leg up.

The Gov't/fed is desperately trying to fight deflationary forces. Between worsening population demographics, technological deflation, massive debt load, which is very deflationary, and now the sudden stopping of the global economy, which jacked up a lot of things under the hood.

This is why the fed still is keeping up the monetary policy even when everyone thinks things have greatly improved, and lots of inflation is happening. They also don't talk about deflation, because they are tasked with keeping markets calm, and deflation talk would send markets into a panic, because deflation takes down ALL assets, and would make the extreme govt and corperate debt unwind.

2021-06-20 21:03:16,wallstreetbets,But rich people horde their wealth while poor people spend and cause inflation. If you give a mega rich person $10 billion they aren't going to spend much of it. If you give 1 million poor people $10k most is going straight into buying shit they need/want causing said inflation.
2021-06-20 21:32:18,wallstreetbets,Sorry…failing to understand the point here?
2021-06-20 21:47:24,wallstreetbets,Simply saying most of the money will eventually flow to the rich which will negate inflation to an extent. Jeff Bezos at $200 billion wealth isn't spending that very quickly. This is why JPow isn't wrong about transitory. The rich will simply get richer and the poor will have slightly less buying power. The USA will have trillionaires while the majority will be no better off.
2021-06-20 21:55:00,wallstreetbets,I certainly agree with transitionary inflation.  I get what you’re saying now.  That’s how it’s happened for the eternity of time though.  My goal is to get as big of slice as possible and hopefully stay in a comfortable spot for life…hope…

2021-06-21 00:11:02,wallstreetbets,The population is concerned that the fed might raise rates which would bring valuations of everything down. And also lumber shouldnt be that expensive it was short term. Maybe the whole machine got working.
2021-06-21 00:42:49,wallstreetbets,Commodities always do this the higher they go the faster and lower they fall. My prediction lumber prices will be lower than 2019 prices by this time next year.

2021-06-21 08:56:37,wallstreetbets,"That’s a piece of it: construction is one industry that was never really slowed down by the pandemic. Chalk it up to the inherently ’distanced’ nature of the work for contractors and sub-contractors, and the fact that while a lot of people were laid off or collecting unemployment the spouse or family member(s) working in construction are usually breadwinners in the family unit anyway, so working additional hours or taking on more projects to supplement their partners losses income has become far more normalized through the pandemic."

So literally my statement is still valid. Why the fuck wouldn’t a company just buy a fat fucking roll of paper to make paper plates than to get into an entirely different industry and get a fucking log to make into paper plates."
2021-06-21 06:06:27,wallstreetbets,"The price didn’t fall bc demand went away, it’s bc supply increased. Demand can still exist while the supply is above the price point that some are willing to pay. Reaching a different price point on the same demand curve doesn’t mean that demand changed, it just means there is a different quantity willing to be purchased. Decreased supply does not entirely shift the demand curve as u are stating by claiming the demand to have changed. This is literally Econ 101

Joe Blow DIYguy might build a deck or a shed, which is equivalent to building maybe 1 room of a new house in terms of lumber consumption, and they can put off those lumber purchases entirely if price point is too high. Meanwhile a large construction company that churns out a bunch of newly constructed homes/apartments/commercial buildings every year basically doesn’t have the option to stop buying lumber ever AND they consume wayyyyy more lumber than a handful of douche bags building small stuff"

2021-06-21 08:27:53,wallstreetbets,"Congrats on getting a B+ on econ 101. Now show me a single article where the supply of wood increased. It didnt happen. Supply increased because people stopped buying.

Oh and when I say people I mean big bis, small bis, DIY, etc. Most of your points are irrelevant. Businesses buy wood to supply customers with a service so everything I said can still be true. House prices going up... builders may increase purchase volume to beat out competitors at certain prices. But it's easy to interpret it a 1000 ways so without proof of supply increase you are too confident in your scenario."
2021-06-20 20:47:47,wallstreetbets,It’s harder than you think. I work the wood on my off time.

Starting with Large Caps, but can post Small Cap follow up if mods and everyone cool with it?

One rule applies to all theories- Stocks are weighted by FAMC (Float Adj. MC) which is hard to find so did rough estimate myself. More confident in my math after I saw Goldman had similar top 10. Not precise, but should be relatively close. 

Large Cap Buying Pressure: Stocks being added to Russell 1K for the first time will experience more buying pressure if they are weighted near the top. (Jeffries report in parenthesis)

2021-06-20 23:25:41,wallstreetbets,"It’s the Walmart approach. They actually don’t make a lot of money per unit, they just sell a shit-ton of them. 

There’s some big builders around here like that. Build em fast and sell em cheap (or build em cheap and sell em fast, either applies). I can’t even compete with them, nor do I want to. OTOH, quality aside, they have a very efficient streamlined process and have no interest in the custom homes I build. We’re not targeting the same customers."

2021-06-20 20:24:28,wallstreetbets,"Bag holding BOTH! I don't think we are anywhere near the top of the housing bubble. Demand has outstripped supply. If there are any foreclosures, they will be gobbled up fast.

After the 2008 crash, there was a glut of houses on the market because of foreclosures. Builders were not building, and now we have a housing shortage. IMHO it will take a couple of years before enough homes are built to meet the current demand."
2021-06-20 22:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Even if they raised rates in 2023, what are we looking at like +0.5% by end of 2023? Oh shit no, not half a point, coming off the lowest lows in history. That will wreck shit for sure.

Housing prices will cool off, but it will be a solid push for the next few years at least. Especially as so many people continue to relocate due to hybrid work."

2021-06-20 22:38:10,wallstreetbets,I think the best thing to do is try to think more simple about it. I get my money every week and when it drops down in price I buy more

There is very good chance for a squeeze. That's why I am still in it.  When? Nobody knows.  Frankly speaking there is a chance that it won't squeeze either. I am not going to lie to you. Or it might go up to $100 or $200 or much higher. That's why we are among millions of people that knows about AMC that are in on it. Because this can go up a lot faster than any other stocks. You going to see some Hedge funds trying to lurk you into other stocks. That's because they want to distract you away from AMC. They are getting more worried by the days because AMC keep getting stronger. And that's a very good warning sign for us retail investors that the stock can squeeze. Just follow up with Matt Korh and Trey Trade on youtubes. They seem to be doing a lot of research into this and their videos seem credible. Unless you have better advice for me and I'll appreciated in advance."
2021-06-20 22:41:37,wallstreetbets,Just do this. Watch AMC and every time it drops down in price buy a little more and do t worry about anything except when it rises up a lot like a lot then you can think about selling. That way you avoid all of the complicated stuff lol I’ve heard a lot will sell at 100 250 1000 5000 100000 500000 etc so pick your price and hope for the best when the squeeze comes.

2021-06-20 20:03:06,wallstreetbets,Well he was right you should have sold at 20.  Then re evaluated your thoughts on it when it was back at 5-6 and bought back in.  Even if it was the same amount you bought at 2.00. You still would have locked in profits.
2021-06-21 08:49:57,wallstreetbets,"Basically when you sell options, as opposed to buying them, you're fulfilling the other side of the contract and you get paid for that. Selling calls while owning shares means your hope is not that it drops but doesn't rise quickly. If the time passes and doesn't meet the strike chosen, you keep the premium paid, otherwise to keep your shares you have to buy the contracts back, for a loss if the stock price has risen. The other option is to let your shares go, selling them for the strike price and keeping the premium. For example, if he chose $70 as a strike price and it went to $80, he would have to sell at $70, which are still huge gains, plus the premium he could keep per share. If the premium were $12 per share for example, he still ""won"" because he could buy back the contract for $10 per share when he was paid $12, meaning he kept only $2 per share of what he got paid and he kept his shares. Essentially you give up your profit above the strike price in exchange for money now and hope you get to keep that money. The buyer of the contract is the owner of all profit on your shares above the strike price."

2021-06-20 23:33:16,wallstreetbets,"Indeed, $ESU21 is already down 21pts as well.   
I'm not happy when everyone loses money, but I hope at least a few will gain from the ideas.   
Thanks MainStreet"
2021-06-20 20:03:38,wallstreetbets,"I have no clue what the outcome will be in a month.I think we're going down next week. How much? no idea, but I think we end lower at the end of next we than we did last friday.

I play all puts very closely....  
If they dip below 30-40% I bail.

Plus, just practice good solid value investing. If things are flying down, don't panic buy puts. Just wait.

When there's a bounce, then pounce."
2021-06-20 20:05:41,wallstreetbets,"That's a risk management question. 

If I'm buying puts that far ahead, I just go OTM enough that I should get a 5x or 6x.   
But I sure don't hold long enough to let theta gang eat my lunch...

I also love 0dte stuff, but that's impossible to advise. It's just Russian roulette with some clue of what might come next."
2021-06-21 07:52:45,wallstreetbets,So you're short SPY because you see a market wide crash triggered by real estate... Why aren't you just short real estate?

I just do monthly or weekly based on risk management but like u said don’t hold for very long it s just strategy I picked up trading spy just wondering what u thought the week look like… I also thought downturn week over so I’ll probley gets some weeklies … but your so right about theta gang killing options on spy when u get a turn in the other direction with that sideways action
2021-06-21 10:46:35,wallstreetbets,"It's not as much real estate, as it is a combination of factors, imo.I'm short the market, because aside from a very small sliver of sectors, the entire thing is bloated beyond bloatware.

Combine that with rampant inflation, China hovering over Taiwan, arguments with China over the virus (and them responding with NUKE talk), along with instability in the middle east.... 

It all aligns for a period of instability in the world.   
No-one believes that can happen because it hasn't happened for so long, but we're basically in a record-breaking period of peace.

2021-06-20 23:55:13,wallstreetbets,"Petting zoo is this way

R/investing <--------"
2021-06-20 23:56:12,wallstreetbets,"Watch a few YouTube videos. At first it seems quite complex but after you got it it seems self explanitory. Just remember... Don't get to greedy. Greed can cause you to lose alot of money. IE holding AMC waiting for it to ""moon"" to 1k ea when you could of been writing calls."
2021-06-21 12:08:44,wallstreetbets,"You get x dollars for agreeing to sell y contracts (each for 100 shares) at a set date and for a set price, z.

Then, on the agreed upon date one of two things happens:

1) The stock never reaches price z -> you get to keep money x and nothing happens
2) The stock reaches price z -> you get money x and y * z * 100 for your shares which you are forced to sell and now no longer own

It's a great strategy to make money on shares you own and works sort of like a limit order in that you essentially set the price you'll sell it at if the stock goes up. If the stock goes down you have a decision to make about selling your holdings and making those calls ""naked"". This isn't always a bad idea if you sell then put a buy order in essentially ensuring it'll be ""covered"" if the stock rockets up."
2021-06-21 01:54:00,wallstreetbets,"And here’s another player that has no idea what’s happening on AMC…

Good luck YOLOing then."
2021-06-21 07:39:47,wallstreetbets,"I let the shares get called away and at the same time bought back in with cash. It was ""only"" 400 shares or something, but that was when GME was $20. And I thought there's no way this shit goes to 40 so quickly. Then I did it again at $80. Thing is, the reason calls have juicy ass 500 IV sometimes is because of the very real risk of having this happen.

Saying shit like ""it's not a real loss"" it's still a gain, is absolutely, unequivocally retarded. The absence of gain IS a loss. If you sold your car that's worth 5000 for only $50 to your friend, you are losing $4500 for the privelege. You wouldn't walk around thinking, hey, that was still a good deal. Im up $50"

2021-06-21 09:37:00,wallstreetbets,"Well If your shares are assigned OTM, can u just simply buy them back? I write weekly AMC 145C, I wish someone would assign my shares at that strike price 😂"
2021-06-21 01:03:27,wallstreetbets,"It’s all about picking the expiration and the strike and then risk management by hedging operations every now and then when things look like they may approach the strike. You can lock in profits using many techniques by buying the calls back, delta hedging with the stock (often commission free) and some option combinations. It’s a trade that requires more active management and it’s not always the best to hold it until expiry but I never lost sleep over a trade like this. It takes some hand holding but it works. The only profit limiting factor is a broker margin. The bidding up of call options that goes on here makes it pretty clear upon closer inspection that the majority of the popular options trade above their fair market value and the premium mostly comes from elevated volatility. But the volatility tends to always decay… just look at VIX for some inspiration."

2021-06-20 21:04:48,wallstreetbets,Mortgage int rate could be 3%...but the first 7 yrs of the loan your payment is like 90% interest. You lay your principal down in the later years. It's not like a flat annual 3%

2021-06-21 14:03:23,wallstreetbets,Not a meme
2021-06-21 14:12:16,wallstreetbets,"You still haven’t told me your definition of “meme stock”, why is that? Clearly that’s where we disagree, so why can’t you explain what you think a meme stock is?"
2021-06-21 14:24:11,wallstreetbets,"Memestock is when a chart lacks fundamentals and technicals and people pile in because of internet hype. 

WISH has some serious underlying positives and the fact reddit piled on after others called it out is besides the fact. 

What resources do you use besides this website for trading?"
2021-06-21 14:38:37,wallstreetbets,"See, that’s where we disagree. We could have avoided 10 comments of whining if you had just explained your definition from the start.

I disagree with requiring a “lack of fundamentals or technicals”. 

“Meme stock”, in my opinion, has simply come to mean any stock whose representation in public discourse is disproportionate to its significance in the market.

In that regard, WISH is far from the only “meme stock” that can be considered significantly undervalued with strong fundamentals. BB and CLNE started picking up steam for the same reasons - no short interest, no funny name or CEO antics, just strong DD that propelled its popularity among retail traders. 

Are BB and CLNE not meme stocks, in your opinion? If not, then that’s fine - we simply disagree on how to define a “meme stock”, and you view the term as a qualitative judgment on a stock rather than as a descriptor of its popularity and virality, while I view it as the latter.

That’s why I asked the other day for you to define “meme stock,” this was all easily avoidable."

2021-06-21 07:31:15,wallstreetbets,"Despite being a semiconductor company, INTC's investement strategy was clear: capitalising on market share lowering investments. This is good for profitability if you have been long for years. Nowadays though their market share is stagnating in the greatest times of digitalisation so far. AMD and NVDA are slowly winning market shares because of investment made in past years. IMHO INTC is to be valued as a value company offering as of today around 2% dividend yield and low growth perspectives. They are trying to stay relevant and no one has a functioning crystal ball, but I would enter in INTC only if it plunged deeper around prices that guarantee a 4% to 5% D/Y.  
But maybe they 'll make a turnaround, who knows. In general though always consider that tech has higher P/E just because of their greater perspectives as digitalisation and therefore market size are considered to be growing faster than the rest of the economy in the next decades. Just my 2 cents."
2021-06-21 18:29:58,wallstreetbets,"As someone who works in the VAR/Reseller space, can confirm. AMD is all about data center business and stealing EUC marketshare at the moment. Their chips aren't anywhere near as constrained as Intel's right now, and they're basically winning by default (in addition to having a quality on-par, if not exceeding Intel's, and a much better price point)."

You’re not wrong to correlate market tanking w UVXY, just understand it’s not direct cause. SPY can trickle down to 405 w/o UVXY making drastic moves.

2021-06-21 11:30:26,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. Sorry, I think I'm too ignorant on covered calls to even know how to form the question as it resided in my head. lol

But yeah, I think you answered it. For instance, if I own 100 shares of XYZ, I can decide to sell covered calls. So in deciding that, I need to figure out what I'm comfortable potentially selling all those shares at, correct? Let's say I got 100 shares of XYZ for $5 per share. I'd be comfortable doubling my money and selling them at $10. So I'd set a strike at $10 and then I guess the premium is based on what current bids are based on implied volatility, etc.? So you could sell covered calls non stop and just make money on the premium when the price is below $10, however, if it goes to $10 at expiry, then you've just sold 100 shares for $10 per share and doubled your investment (in addition to whatever you made in premium while the stock was below $10)?

Is there a rule of thumb to go buy when deciding the strike? Like is there possibly something where it just doesn't make sense to set a strike at a price which would give you less than double your investment? If I got 100 shares for $5, I assume it wouldn't quite make sense to sell covered calls with a strike of $5.50 (as an example). as you're just not going to make much in the end."

That is correct yes

>Is there a rule of thumb to go buy when deciding the strike?  Like is there possibly something where it just doesn't make sense to set a strike at a price which would give you less than double your investment?

No but you want the premium to make it worthwhile. If you have a $5 stock and pick a $10 strike a week out from now the premium is going to be extremely small. NOK for example is trading at about $5 right now and a $10 strike 1 week from now is .01 (ask not bid so no one is buying these I doubt you could sell one). 1 month from now the bid is .02 which is extremely small. You have to go all the way out to like Jan 21 2022 for a decent premium of .17 which is $17 per 100 shares but ties you money up until then. 

NOK is a pretty low IV so premiums are small but lets say you choose Jun 25 $5.50 that's also .02 which is the same premium as $10 1 month from now. So if you sold weekly at .02 you are making 4x the premium vs having a high strike 1 month out. When doing shorter closer to the money options you can adjust each week if your shares are never called away"

2021-06-21 14:22:52,wallstreetbets,"This is a whole other DD on it's own. Let me summarise.

The whole reason the share price was in this mess in the first place was due to the fact that a multi-billion dollar contract with the USPS to build an entirely electric fleet was fumbled - it was given over to Oshkosh Defence instead, even though they don't have the knowledge or resources to [build an all-electric fleet as per the Biden Administration](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/usps-to-continue-purchasing-gas-vehicles-despite-biden-all-electric-pledge/595675/) (very suspicious).

[Oshkosh stated themselves that only 10% will be electric](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131375_fresh-usps-mail-trucks-revealed-not-all-will-be-electric).

Secondly, [Oshkosh's contract has recently been halted and they are under investigation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/09/house-lawmakers-push-biden-administration-to-investigate-usps-contract-with-oshkosh-.html).

[Workhorse sues the USPS](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/06/16/usps-trucks-workhorse-lawsuit/).

But even without the USPS contract, [Workhorse received an order for over 6,000 electric vans](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/04/workhorse-group-announces-order-for-more-electric/).

**This is huge for Workhorse's upcoming balance sheets.**

Believe it or not, this horse has hooves and can gallop on its own. USPS contract, and short squeeze or not, this company has a future.

And I'm still betting on the fact that the USPS get what's coming to them, there's no way Biden would let that slide if he is in fact the leader he claims to be.

The world is fighting for a greener tomorrow. WKHS is not only the people's bet, it's an ethical bet."

2021-06-21 14:59:41,wallstreetbets,"WKHS are clearly the best candidate for the USPS all-electric fleet.

And like I said, USPS contract or not, WKHS will still turn a profit and the stock price post-squeeze should see steady growth in the upcoming years regardless.

In the event that Oshkosh Defence and the USPS board members are exposed and WKHS gets the contract, the share price will be sent to the stratosphere.

You can view this play as a speculative long or join the short-term fun. Several whales have already stepped in on many different occasions in the past few weeks. I think that regardless of retail investors the shorts will be forcibly squeezed out anyways. 

It's in an incredibly fragile state and as wallstreetbets history has shown, fundamentals don't always influence a short squeeze (but this does have incredible potential regardless)."
2021-06-21 15:25:52,wallstreetbets,"I myself own 200 shares of WKHS. I'm trying to find reasons to buy calls but can't find convincing arguments to get in within the next 3 months. Indeed, fundamentals don't always influence a short squeeze but surprise elements will trigger a short squeeze. I don't see positive surprise events for WKHS in the short term."
2021-06-21 19:34:01,wallstreetbets,"Of course nothing in the market is guaranteed, I've provided data and indicators but it is up to you to decide on how you wanna play it.

Personally I picked up Jul 16 45/60 bull debit spreads. Cheap when the IV is low, cost about 0.04 each, BIG upside if it hits the 30+ range, or you can make chicken change off of an IV spike."

Ps. the shills in this thread are amazing. Spending shitloads of money on awards to make it seem that many people are scared. You think it makes sense that there are 100s of threads pro-AMC and pro-GME, with thousands and thousands of likes and awards, and then there is this 1 post among them, with a measily 100  votes, but quite some awards. You think that is not sucpicious? Are you hedge fuck actually so retarded? And even if you, OP, are really not a shill, the other people in this thread most definitely are.

If i may give you some advice: if you can miss the money, keep holding, and dont be scared. We will win. And if not, we did fuck the evil hedgefunds over for billions and billions of dollars. I think my money is worth losign these evil people 80 billion here and another 10 billion there, and its not over for a looooong time.

Im happy you are having a shit life currently, hedgefunds. Just give up"

21:09:31 7/16 8c 50k@0.03 and 7c 50k@0.08

It is extremely unlikely that these were someone buying a combo of buying both strikes.  It was a call spread.  Possibly only 50k were done and the second print is a duplicate or more likely is that the order got split between two marketmakers."

So, based on the company fundamental news it is in the growing range and the price is in the deep level (with comparing on February which the news were not much as these days). On February $Tlry rised over $70 and now it should be around $30 with a lot of great news of the company and opening in Canada and US."

They baught at emission course, so they are still not at loss with the current values, too. 

For them this is a long term investment in a research facility to get cheap mass producable easy to store mrna stuff out to the majority of the world. 

I would bet their main goal is not vaccination but the rna printers.

Edit:
And i do own stock and didnt get out fast enough :-)

He posted the number of shares (267) so it only took 2 seconds to determine what his cost basis was $188 and what the price was when he took the screenshot $260.  At the time he posted the screenshot the price was $217, and at the time I replied to your comment it was $212 - ergo only $6,600.
