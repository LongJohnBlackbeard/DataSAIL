2021-06-16 19:26:28,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂😂😂
2021-06-16 19:35:05,wallstreetbets,TTM of -800 million.  Yeah you should be worried.  That shit is going down like the Titanic.
2021-06-16 19:51:20,wallstreetbets,What platform are you using to trade?
2021-06-16 19:41:08,wallstreetbets,I got in at 14.14. Just a number man. Don’t stress. It will come around. If we can get high 12s tomorrow this thing will explode. It’s not out of the question 💵💵
2021-06-16 19:54:43,wallstreetbets,"Reminds me of CLOV... Sold out before the $10 break two weeks ago, lol."
2021-06-16 19:45:07,wallstreetbets,Nice.
2021-06-16 19:47:15,wallstreetbets,Maybe you actually read their financials you’d understand why. But you’re too lazy obviously. Not worried a bit.
2021-06-16 19:49:39,wallstreetbets,Ya see I wasn’t worried last week. But I bought a call and it expires Friday. And pretty sure it ain’t gonna blow up anytime this week
2021-06-16 19:55:46,wallstreetbets,"If the 12.5 calls get in the money it could get crazy. 
Just my opinion. I hope you bang em!!!  Good luck."
2021-06-16 19:04:39,wallstreetbets,your too smart for the new wsb.  well done
2021-06-16 19:00:40,wallstreetbets,Another financial crisis coming.
2021-06-16 19:46:02,wallstreetbets,Wait what ?
2021-06-16 19:46:41,wallstreetbets,"Watched my bank options fade all morning,  and then roar back. Wish I'd bought more."
2021-06-16 19:37:07,wallstreetbets,What do you mean?  Because the banks made money?
2021-06-16 19:42:34,wallstreetbets,"No because the banks using the repo money to inflate the stock market. 

If the stock market crash they will be holding a shitbag….

Think the feds will let them write it off as a tax deduction? 🤔🤣"
2021-06-16 19:43:21,wallstreetbets,Don’t understand WTF that means but sounds like buy calls on banks. Got it. ITUB calls for market open.

2021-06-16 18:55:24,wallstreetbets,Locked out of day trading to try and grow some balls and hold
2021-06-16 19:45:54,wallstreetbets,Using the same design can have vastly different results.  Phizer started with like 10 different mRNA vaccines and chose the one that worked.  Curevac doesn't have that kinda capital
2021-06-16 18:42:04,wallstreetbets,Moderna/Pfizer is the gold standard.
2021-06-16 19:06:05,wallstreetbets,I have hope in the Novavax vaccine
2021-06-16 18:46:07,wallstreetbets,"INO-4800 and 4802 are the safest and most effective vaccine yet to be released on the world. 4802 addresses the variants as well. Too bad the crooked FDA is in Big Pharma’s pocket. It’s great the rest of the world will benefit from Inovio’s technology, really wish the US could as well."
2021-06-16 18:58:14,wallstreetbets,"You get gold medal for coming first (Pfizer), silver second ((Moderna), bronze for third (J&J). 

Do you know what 4th, 5th etc finishers get? Nothing. Ok, maybe you get a cap. That’s what Inovio will get for being the 6th? Vaccine. A Cap."
2021-06-16 19:09:42,wallstreetbets,Tell me when you grow your antlers sweet tooth
2021-06-16 19:36:08,wallstreetbets,It's neither AXLE nor a gold standard Warthog ;)
2021-06-16 18:54:29,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it's crooked FDA to be honest. The US has a SURPLUS of fairly effective vaccines. 

So much so, that Biden is DONATING vaccines to other countries.

We don't need this vaccine to pan out so obviously we aren't going to fund the clinical trials of this particular vaccine."
2021-06-16 19:10:25,wallstreetbets,Lol...
2021-06-16 19:37:47,wallstreetbets,"Well I'm invested in Moderna... In my arm and in my portfolio.

So Moderna is awesome. Best BioPharma ever.

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man)"
2021-06-16 18:59:13,wallstreetbets,"You make a good point. It’s unfortunate they were delayed by the FDA to the point where the other guys were able to flood the market with their vaccines. That said, you are right that this is the position we are in now. It’s a big, big world out there and especially with the variants, and in areas of the world where cold chain is an issue, still plenty of need and demand for INO-4800/02. We should be seeing some solid news coming soon."
2021-06-16 19:40:47,wallstreetbets,"Valid point. If FDA isn't crooked then why it put a hold on Cellectra at P3. Why? If it was fatal then the block should have come at P2 itself. Are the life of 100 odd p2 participants cheap? Elecfroporation is a well known technique to push large dna molecules.

Also, the PEG based capsules used to deliver RNA has side effects. FDA bluntly ignored the warnings! Rest assured FDA is not a fair governing body."
2021-06-16 19:44:05,wallstreetbets,Get out of that sooner from your arm and from your investment if in profits. Neither moderna's booster will be used nor will they ever produce another product to use.
2021-06-16 19:57:04,wallstreetbets,"You aren't going to see any good news.  Week response, in phase 2 trials.  Now starting a phase 3 in China.  Phase 3 trials take an eternity and the current vaccines are being produced in massive quantity.  Supply is high enough of the 3 approved in the US we are sending them all over the world because we don't have the demand for them.

Phizer and Moderna are each on track to produce 1.5 billion doses by the end of the year.

Inovio will be lucky to have sketchy phase 3 data out by then.

Their phase 2 was done on like 50 people.  Going to see some fun side effects when the hit phase 3 and aren't just giving it to people with no pre existing conditions."
2021-06-16 19:47:36,wallstreetbets,Inovio is a DNA based vaccine that is garbage for immune response.  There is a reason their funding got pulled and it wasnt the FDA
2021-06-16 19:50:34,wallstreetbets,Because the immune response wasn't strong enough.  Producing a response isn't the same as producing an effective response.
2021-06-16 19:57:25,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha..
😂 😂 You are talking in scientific jargon to a scientist! Lolz. It's fun to chat with you!"
2021-06-16 19:59:11,wallstreetbets,I thought I was dumbing it down for the common man.
2021-06-16 19:17:30,wallstreetbets,Best meme I’ve seen all week.
2021-06-16 18:39:26,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, this is gold 😂"
2021-06-16 18:57:04,wallstreetbets,I will not be shocked if SPY pulls out a 2% day tomorrow. This market is Wild and futures mean nothing. SPY has been unstoppable for so long now I’m not surprised when this market does anything crazy.

2021-06-16 19:32:29,wallstreetbets,"It really could.  Sometimes people underestimate the ability of the US economy to kick the can down the road.  

This could go on for years.

Burry will be right, I’m sure, eventually.

Let’s make money until then yes?"
2021-06-16 18:52:08,wallstreetbets,"i upvoted u, but no they think they r michael burry nowadays tbh, too many watched big short LOL

there are people on here unironically thinking they can short robinhood at ipo with $400 dollar accounts"

2021-06-16 18:58:07,wallstreetbets,"I mean this past month ive only seen maybe 1-3 loss posts on spy puts, but most gain/loss porn nowndays is calls on memes. But yeah it’ll be interesting to see what happens with robinhood ipo. Doubt these kids that spam rocket emojis will put their money where their mouth is on robinhood puts"
2021-06-16 19:44:17,wallstreetbets,"Around 10am, got the 2 day exp.  SQQQ isn't something you want to hold."
2021-06-16 19:00:43,wallstreetbets,i mean i hate robinhood but i like money more so i'm not going to short them.  I barely even know how tbh.  i could buy puts but i wont.

2021-06-16 18:44:37,wallstreetbets,just needs to get to $10 so the 40k OI on the 6/18 10c's go ITM. At $11 theres another 50k contracts that will go ITM. So close to a gamma squeeze just need volume

2021-06-16 18:34:45,wallstreetbets,"Since my post gets deleted I’ll just add it as a comment here:

Do you feel scammed yet?

When you compare the week to date returns on the stocks the shills pushed last week (W***, C***, WK**) vs AMC you’ll see they’re all down ranging from roughly -2% to -30% while AMC even with the dip is still sitting up 15% … these were / are distractions from the big play that’s crippling the HF."
2021-06-16 18:40:25,wallstreetbets,Wish is such a toxic degenerate company.  Gme and amc have nostalgia and good vibes.  The only good thing wish ever produced was YouTube creators sponsorships to hype a sludge pit of a company.

2021-06-16 18:56:52,wallstreetbets,Smartest man in the room . I wasn't making money just holding started buying the dip sale high. I made 22k in 1 week (lost 10k of that so far this week)

Bahaha. 

Don't believe anything the Gov. says until it's officially denied. 

I like your questions but the market is a forward looking mechanism, and that mechanism is saying inflation is going to subside, although at higher prices relative to 2 or 3 years ago. 

No ideas about your car situation. 

If you have a rebuttal, throw it at me!"
2021-06-16 18:26:52,wallstreetbets,We should have a sub for this type of shit. Wallstreet politics

My buddy just got an offer from the dealership to tradein his 1 year old Raptor. 

He ended up not doing it. They'd give him what he'd pay for it when it was brand new, but theyre charging $20k over book on new raptor. While someone may pay it.. I wont.  

and my 16' expedition dusts a raptor on the daily. Same engine, shorter wheel base and smaller tires = smokes the overpriced raptor."
2021-06-16 19:19:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah… NON-transitory Inflation. Boy oh boy are my USO calls about to 🚀⛽️

I agree that the market is a forward looking mechanism and detached from reality. 

My point re: car situation is acquiring more data on top of whats known to try and paint a better picture. 

I do not believe inflation will be transitory."
2021-06-16 18:29:40,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, what deviates this discussion kinda post to earn a label of politics?

2021-06-16 19:17:21,wallstreetbets,And that’s why I bought WISH—the name just makes it so lovable and rememberable that everyone will buy it.

2021-06-16 18:18:51,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I loaded up on DKNG when it dipped to 47 today.

2021-06-16 18:18:01,wallstreetbets,"I understand, Tesla isn't just an electric vehicle manufacture, it's much more than that. Ford is just a car manufacturer period. So Yes investing in Tesla is wise move but I feel like ford will go up in near future do to e-vehicles and their cars getting federal incentives (just my opinion)."
2021-06-16 19:12:26,wallstreetbets,I am certainly no fan of Cathie  and I think she will fizzle out like all hot shot stock pickers have done in the past. But I think this particular stock there’s a buy on the dip. I own some shares and bought some call options but I am waiting to see if it touches $40 a share before I add more.

2021-06-16 18:59:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but they don't wanna wait 3 weeks to get something that doesn't match what they ordered.  Dollar stores are successful for impulse shoppers and halfwits.

For all those telling me I should have sold. You do not understand that  AMC is at a tipping point and how it's literally on the verge of going parabolic. AMC and gme are the two plays right now and it's a Black swan event.

I'm willing to lose $200,000 on the chance it could turn into 2 million plus tomorrow.

2021-06-16 18:19:07,wallstreetbets,"Long term, if the outlook is good, stick with it. 

Short term, I think there’s better places to put your money. The next pop to $15 I would cash out and take my 50% and go to something else. 

It has a rising MACD from the last low, and there were a lot of shares that were picked up recently in early June. 

It could honestly swing back and forth but stay pinned between 12-14 for quite a few months. The consolidation on this one is on the lower end

If you like the tech, I’d suggest rotating over to MP since they have rising profit and are looking to retest the run to $50 this early summer. 

Look up volume by price. You can see where the demand for shares is"

2021-06-16 19:07:04,wallstreetbets,I have no idea. Its all speculation at this point. But it makes more sense career wise to join another winning team than try to right a severely leaky ship IMO
2021-06-16 19:07:43,wallstreetbets,Ive had a position in nio since 4 per share. I Like the stock. Not gonna pump it to ya but lets just say i didnt sell at 67 for a reason
2021-06-16 19:09:19,wallstreetbets,"Is nio legit or what? I see nothing but good things, but after what I’ve seen lately I realize those “articles” that appear on my google usually have ultrerior motives! I bought 10 shares a few weeks ago at 38 and they’re up a lot since them. Kinda wish I had bought 10,000 shares!"
2021-06-16 19:09:38,wallstreetbets,Wow that would have been a nice gain
2021-06-16 19:10:20,wallstreetbets,I’m not asking to pump I’m genuinely curious. Have been for a few weeks now ever since my buddy mentioned it to me. Like to hear other people’s opinion
2021-06-16 19:16:34,wallstreetbets,"I think they are . Its just tough cus its a chinese stock. If that company was American it would be 80 -100 per share by now. Honestly the only thing that has gotten in our way was the chip shortage . Which is probably gonna be over by end of june or july. The CEO has a unique vision for an auto company, always under promises and over delivers and maintains level headed communication with shareholders constantly. Idk what more you could ask from a company. 

HOWEVER

The valuation is certainly high for where they are. If you cant handle volatility mixed with long periods of static movement in a stock then i wouldnt get more involved. It is my most successful and fun investment to date...that being said i bought at 4 all the way up to 30 so . Yeah. Ive done very well so far

I would say the real risk now is continued performance and the race to profitability, along with the fact that MARKET wide correction can still take place across tech. They are ALL trading high multiples. But the risk of them going bankrupt is gone, they are state backed, and currently expanding to Europe. It’s certainly a less risky investment than most of the stuff being pushed on this forum. You just have to stomach the valuation and the stigma of china."
2021-06-16 19:20:25,wallstreetbets,"Haha I’m long in RIDE, I can handle volatility! It’s been wild so far but it’s been fun! I need to diversify a little bit I may grab some more. I just wish they were still 4$! I’m still working my way up in the world I’m not quite there yet with the capital where I can buy the amount of 45$ shares I need to then a sweet profit…someday I’ll get there."
2021-06-16 19:22:18,wallstreetbets,Eh i would say thats the wrong way to look at it...price per share doesnt matter...prospective growth and share price appreciation is what matters. My first investment was tesla @ 450 ish range presplit. I only put in 3k. It outperformed everyother investment that ive made thus far.
2021-06-16 19:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Doesnt matter what price per share it is...only matters where you think it can go. If a 450 dollar stock goes to 4,000 would it have been a better decision to put your money in a 5 dollar stock that goes to 15 in twice the time? The answer is no"
2021-06-16 19:28:02,wallstreetbets,Btw that’s one hell of a first investment!
2021-06-16 19:26:44,wallstreetbets,"Good point. I guess I’m just looking at, if the stock price goes up $10, the more shares you earn the better that return will be. If I can only afford to buy 10 shares, it would take a huge change in share price to actually make a difference."
2021-06-16 19:27:36,wallstreetbets,"Oh I would say buying a hundred shares is probably the minimum I want to try to do in an investment. But I agree with what you said, something is better than jothing"
2021-06-16 19:50:46,wallstreetbets,I’m just getting to all these responses in reverse order lol but I get it. Loud and clear. It’s all a percentage game
2021-06-16 19:35:16,wallstreetbets,And i dont agree wjth your logic. Your return is based on the PERCENTAGE return on investment. If you only have 2k to invest you want to find the company with the best chance of HIGH PERCENTAGE growth. Doesnt matter your share count . 2k is 2k whether you own 200 shares or 1 million
2021-06-16 19:31:27,wallstreetbets,Right but thats what you’re looking for. If you take a longer term approach to investing this will become more apparent. You are looking for undervalued stocks OR a company that you believe is undervalued compared to where it will be (hopefully) long term. I dont know your history with investing but i think the APE mentality may have corrupted your interpretation of stock PRICE versus Market CAP . Another thing that helps me with investing is the importance of investing in a management team just as much as a “company”. For instance. Yes RIDE or WKHS or NIKOLA could turn the ship around but there was a serious flaw in Management there. When you start investing in people as much as a stock price i think it increases your chance of success. Nio’s CEO is dope. Never been happier with another ceo ive investment money with
2021-06-16 19:36:43,wallstreetbets,Number of shares doesnt matter. Get that idea out of your smooth brain my dude
2021-06-16 19:49:50,wallstreetbets,Wow that all makes a lot of sense. And Inhavent been sucked in to the ape mentality RIDE is my first investment. I also have 100 shares of ccl. And I have a Roth IRA with only VOO. I just started all this in february after I paid off all my credit card debt. Originally was only going to do vanguard but wanted to try some other things too since I have a long way until I retire! It’s been a learning experience so far
2021-06-16 19:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Lol damn that’s harsh but ok, got ya. It’s all about percentages. I guess to word it different would be if you aren’t investing a few grand your percentage in return won’t be too high? But point taken. And it’s a fair point. If I only have 500 to invest I want to put it some where that I will make the best return, regardless of share prices"
2021-06-16 19:57:39,wallstreetbets,You’re on the right track
2021-06-16 19:56:44,wallstreetbets,Im harshly honest. Best way to be IMO . Percentage ROI (return on investment) doesnt change based on number of shares or price of share. It is simply your return! :) 😅🙃😖🥵😱

1. Volatility.

2. Trade volume.

2021-06-16 19:27:21,wallstreetbets,"Should have explained it to him. Efficacy is the drug compared to the control group (placebo). If you have 100 people who take Pfizer and 2 get sick, it’s not an efficacy of 98%, it has to be compared to the control group. If the control group gets 4 people sick in the same time frame, it’s an efficacy of 50%. I’m not certain that’s the exact equation, but it’s the idea. A placebo vs placebo test would lead to near 0% efficacy over time statistically, but realistically you’d get random 1-10% depending on the group size and duration."

2021-06-16 16:51:25,wallstreetbets,The investor conference call yesterday disclosed 30k firm orders. What's your source on buyers?
2021-06-16 16:51:49,wallstreetbets,"Correction: Per the Zoom call yesterday, Rich Schmidt (Pres, and formerly reporting to Elon at Tesla) stated they have current funds of $400M to last to May 2022 and will produce 15,000 to 20,000 trucks by May 2022.  This is a HUGE change from their former goal of 20,000 trucks produced in all of 2022 and having only $50M in cash left by end of this year.    This is $RIDE 2.0 now and things have changed.  When they get funding to expand production capacity for 2022 and when they announce a new CEO, $RIDE should really rise nicely."
2021-06-16 17:04:45,wallstreetbets,"10-20k vehicles by May ain't too shabby.  An EV has to start somewhere.   

Personally, I'm going to ride this next chapter w/shares.   (Chapter 1 kinda sucked. Chapter 2 is looking a lot better.)"

2021-06-16 16:53:41,wallstreetbets,"Yet when they were asked if they were confirmed they jumped around and refused to answer Yes to any questions regarding the actual pre order numbers and would not answer if any were binding.

Also they are only expecting production capacity of 20,000 vehicles, that's not enough to cover a single quarter of cash burn."
2021-06-16 16:59:52,wallstreetbets," President Rich Schmidt said at an Automotive Press Association event in Detroit. ""Those are firm orders we have for those two years.""

""I don't know the exact facts of the legal aspect of that, but they are basically binding orders that are committed here in the last two weeks, reconfirmed orders,"" he added, when asked if they were binding orders. ""They're pretty solid, and I think that's on the light side or conservative side.""

Notice how he is using ambiguous language.  Will not say yes they are binding, doesn't know the facts ( that's scary for the president of a company with one focus to not know the facts of the issue he is speaking about )

Their pre orders are still no obligation, so the numbers re confirmed means nothing.  They have been pushing their pre orders as their biggest strength when they admitted to paying marketing companies for generating pre order numbers."
2021-06-16 18:28:02,wallstreetbets,"Yes, we haven't been deceived by RIDE before at all. Funny how all these ""orders"" pop up right after the last guy had to resign over irregularities"
2021-06-16 17:03:33,wallstreetbets,"So they found 350 million dollars on the floor?  Because their financial disclosure didn't show that they had that kind of cash on hand.  So either A he's wrong, or B they lied previously."
2021-06-16 17:12:27,wallstreetbets,"That's still not enough to even cover their current cash burn.

They also have competition from known manufacturers. 

If I'm in the market for an EV truck, do I buy a f 150 lightning or something from a tiny company that has been riddled with problems and no real service infrastructure.

Ford proved they can produce a quality EV with the mach E.  People are loving those and they are selling like mad.

Ford has made the most popular pickup for how many years now?  4 decades or more.  

I wish you luck but this is going to fold.  I would not be surprised if GM makes an offer to loan them enough to hang themselves with so they can claim their IP and facility in bankruptcy court"
2021-06-16 16:53:41,wallstreetbets,"Now, now, put the political stuff aside. Also their free cash flow is horrendous aside from this current term when the president was elected… Also by saying that you would then admit to collusion because the president is not supposed to favor any company…."
2021-06-16 16:54:36,wallstreetbets,But you may be right. My only issue is that too many stocks now are being pumped and dumped. This seems up to par with that..
2021-06-16 17:18:34,wallstreetbets,Elon Musk is gonna help out the competition that makes sense
2021-06-16 16:59:15,wallstreetbets,They did say the orders were firm though. I think the 20k is all they can build without a successful cap raise. It's just a question of whether or not they get it done.
2021-06-16 17:09:12,wallstreetbets,"So it's semantics for you, firm vs binding? I agree the pre order nonsense was a fiasco. But hearing that they have X firm orders is what I care about."
2021-06-16 18:49:24,wallstreetbets,"There were always some orders, but they just weren't clearly defined."
2021-06-16 17:12:10,wallstreetbets,">So they found 350 million dollars on the floor?  Because their financial disclosure didn't show that they had that kind of cash on hand.  So either A he's wrong, or B they lied previously.

What I gathered from the call was at least these two things: (1) They are not proceeding with eRV at this time, (2) They are not announcing the eVan prototype in June as they had planned--but will do so later in the Summer.  I believe the former CEO was being too aggressive with expenditures trying to ""have it all now"" and just banking on the ATVM loan and other financing to get it done -- as opposed to the $RIDE 2.0 plan which is to spend the next 3 months fully focused on start of Endurance production in Sept 2021 (per the Pres, Schmidt) and not spending on anything else but getting 15,000 to 20,000 trucks produced.  SMART MOVE!"
2021-06-16 17:14:02,wallstreetbets,"It was an hour long call.  Let me know if you are interested and I will add the link here for you.  Bottom line, it was extremely refreshing to hear the new smart direction and I am not happy at all that the former CEO didn't have this new plan all along!"
2021-06-16 19:06:56,wallstreetbets,"Appears to be going more for company trucks, not Avg Joe.

I felt same way about upcoming Ford, Dodge, Tesla , Rivian competition and got out last week or two."
2021-06-16 17:48:53,wallstreetbets,I believe in my President
2021-06-16 17:19:34,wallstreetbets,"Theres no competition if you buy them out… that was my point to the previous post, sir."
2021-06-16 17:21:11,wallstreetbets,They then would own workhorse. Sorry didnt do my dd before i started shit posting on shit posts
2021-06-16 17:00:41,wallstreetbets,"Again ambiguous language, when pressed to say binding he danced away from it and in the previous sentence said he didn't know the facts!"
2021-06-16 17:19:12,wallstreetbets,"That's not semantics, one is left open to interpretation the other is a statement of fact.  

You either have something or you don't.  A binding order is something you can take and show as future value.

A totally non binding firm belief isn't worth anything.

Get two offers on your house for sale.  One puts up cash and makes an offer, with confirmation they are approved for a loan or have the cash to buy, and are willing to sign a contract that if they walk away from the deal you keep the earnest money.

The other says yeah I'd totally like it.  But doesn't offer cash up front, shows no ability to get it financed, and won't commit.  But say they are firm on their intentions to buy

Which offer are you going to take seriously.  That's the difference between binding and knowing the details and what RIDE president is saying."
2021-06-16 19:42:29,wallstreetbets,"Because they mean nothing. Non binding, no money down. Publicity stunts. If a real order, has been made by a real company. The whole world would know exact details"
2021-06-16 17:24:07,wallstreetbets,"It's damage control, they still don't have a single binding order.  

If they want their pre order numbers to be held seriously, make a non refundable deposit required, and not a paltry 100 bucks.  Make them sign a binding contract that if they walk away they lose their deposit.  Then promise a delivery date that if they don't make the customer is entitled to their deposit back if they choose.  That would show how many people are serious about buying."
2021-06-16 17:33:10,wallstreetbets,"I read the transcript, it's alot faster than listening to it.  It's still full of ambiguous language and looks like desperation to try to cut every cost possible to hopefully get a production model made so they can go begging for more funding, which means dilution or debt.  

Not having a pre production vehicle that can be evaluated and test driven three months before allegedly going to production is unheard of.  

Their performance in Baja with that stunt was embarrassing for their engineering department.  If they can't calculate the energy usage for different driving conditions it's sad.  They couldn't factor in the larger tires increased resistance.  This is basics."
2021-06-16 19:14:30,wallstreetbets,"If they are targeting fleets they would have purchase contracts, no one puts in an order for a dozen trucks without a contract with terms for price, delivery window, deposits, how they are paying, if it's cash purchase or financed through 3rd party.  

They can not show a single binding order.

Hell they don't even have a pre production vehicle to demo to  potential customers.  They have test mules, that occasionally light on fire."
2021-06-16 17:58:06,wallstreetbets,"I think you're splitting hairs here, looking for a reason to be a denier. I'm satisfied with his response, but understand that until the Endurance actually becomes saleable, any order means nothing."
2021-06-16 17:30:55,wallstreetbets,"The $100 is from the website. The 30,000 orders are from direct fleets/businesses. They have different agreements. If I’m not mistaken, they used the word binding during the Zoom presentation."
2021-06-16 17:45:54,wallstreetbets,"No question there is a lot that can go wrong in a pre-production company.  When I look at what they have accomplished in the relatively short time they have been working on this project, it is impressive...to me anyway.  I like many things and I have chosen to invest a large sum:  their experienced exec's, their new ""2.0"" strategy, the Voltage Valley story (and I'm not from Ohio) and putting people back to work, the start-up nature of it, the commercial fleet focus, the simplicity and low maintenance/competitive advantage of the hub motor technology, and maybe more.  All the best to you in your investments."
2021-06-16 18:03:24,wallstreetbets,That's not splitting hairs that's them trying to sound positive without setting themselves up for a massive lawsuit by directly avoiding making a sold statement.
2021-06-16 17:38:56,wallstreetbets,"It's 100 bucks and fully refundable if you change your mind.


And no, when asked if it was binding orders, ya know the kind people who are buying a fleet make, they refused to answer Yes.  Instead they danced around it, said they didn't know the facts about it and said they believe it's firm.  If it's binding, when you are asked if it's binding you say YES.  They wouldn't do that.


""I don't know the exact facts of the legal aspect of that, but they are basically binding orders that are committed here in the last two weeks, reconfirmed orders,"" he added, when asked if they were binding orders. ""They're pretty solid ""
 

Again if it's a binding order, from a company that is buying a fleet, they don't make an order through the website.  They sit down and write a contract and negotiate a price per unit and delivery schedule.  The seller and buyer agree on details and make a binding legal contract with consequences for both sides if one doesn't hold up their end.
Quote pulled from their presentation"
2021-06-16 17:52:03,wallstreetbets,"A story.... Really that's what you are.seeing as a positive.  Some bullshit spin from marketing. A feel good ideal without a single tangible fact to back it up.

They haven't even put out a pre production vehicle for evaluation.  

Their 2.0 strategy is only happening because they got caught lying to investors and their bullshit company exposed.  I get it you don't wanna take a loss, but this company is shit."
2021-06-16 18:53:23,wallstreetbets,Rhe solid statements will come after they have a saleable vehicle.
2021-06-16 18:18:53,wallstreetbets,"The website does not allow orders anymore.  It states: ""Out of Stock"" I believe."
2021-06-16 18:57:58,wallstreetbets,If they ever do.  Not a single other manufacturer doesn't have a pre production model that can be evaluated before production begins.  They haven't even done that simple task.
2021-06-16 18:34:17,wallstreetbets,"Not surprised, after they paid people to inflate the numbers to con investors they would remove it."
2021-06-16 19:54:34,wallstreetbets,"If it was a simple task anyone could do it. They said end of September for SORP, and that hasn't changed."

2021-06-16 16:38:00,wallstreetbets,Because they don't make any money and we're going into a downturn in RE

2021-06-16 16:54:53,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure cause it’s gonna put pressure on home sales
2021-06-16 16:43:27,wallstreetbets,Buy on spec sell on news. Retail investors are the last at the trough for shit like that.
2021-06-16 16:47:26,wallstreetbets,Well I think you should look around and see that just about everything went down.
2021-06-16 16:56:12,wallstreetbets,Discount brokerage model. Not enough money in it.
2021-06-16 17:32:44,wallstreetbets,"Compass IPO is probably the reason. I happen to think that company is a stinker though. Their model is not very good. They bought their place in the market, didn’t earn it. But that doesn’t mean Zillow and Redfin are fucking dope by comparison. 

Also - rheres been some doomy and gloomy headlines about the RE market recently and I don’t think that should be overlooked. Millennials saying buying was their biggest regret, not-so-special houses going 1 million over asking price in bidding wars. It’s getting crazy. Real Estate market too hot, most people can no longer afford to buy at this point. Prices ridiculous. Going to be a down market soon. Listen to Dr. Shortburry."

Also as another ape stated, I as well called, ppl can’t wait to go on ships… selling out at crazy prices! I wish I had another month.

2021-06-16 16:33:50,wallstreetbets,I think your expiration is very risky. I believe everything you’re saying but that doesn’t mean the switched gets flipped in the next two days.
2021-06-16 16:47:22,wallstreetbets,CLNE needs to take off
2021-06-16 17:13:27,wallstreetbets,I got long shot calls so I’m hoping it makes a massive comeback in 2022
2021-06-16 16:36:51,wallstreetbets,Well I thought we would be there by now especially when it was trading at 31.50. Let’s see what happens before close tomorrow. That will decide if I ride it out or not. I’m -$10k on it as it stands.
2021-06-16 16:53:51,wallstreetbets,CCL to $30 need .72 /// CLNE to $12 need $1.30 /// CLOV to $14.50 Ouch 🤕

2021-06-16 16:24:32,wallstreetbets,The premium actually moves that much on a small rise after the big dip like that?
2021-06-16 16:48:41,wallstreetbets,Gorgeous gorgeous. Gonna try this strategy every time the fed talks.

That was a catalyst! RIDE is up 16% since Monday and closing higher everyday. 

Get in while it's cheap!

2021-06-16 16:20:07,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the heads up. I’ll 🦍 in for for handful 👍🏻
2021-06-16 16:36:16,wallstreetbets,"I’m long on RIDE. I see the RIDE posts on here, and although I’m happy to see others posting about it, it’s troubling to see all the hate on here. I would have thought this would be one that people got behind but clearly that’s not the case. I will say/ask this. Do you think these posts are from desperate bag holders? Do you think they’re being paid by Lordstown to just pump the stock? Genuinely curious as to what your thoughts are when you see these. I know I can speak for myself and a few other people I know from the sub Reddit, and we actually believe in the company. We’re truly fans of it, so to speak. We’re not trying to push some hopeless pump and dump, we actually want to see the company succeed. I think a lot of us just want to be proven right more than anything lol we’re not trying to get anyone to save us here. I can’t speak for this particular OP but there’s a lot of local people invested in RIDE and they’re no shills. It’s nice to see Lordstown appearing to be headed in the right direction. They’ve almost been shorted into oblivion. I’ve never seen so many news articles mislead and lie about a company like this in my life. And people on here spit out the same lines that I read from these hedge fund funded media outlets. It kind of makes me wonder if some of you haters are the actua shills, but Ill just assume you all just get your info from the articles so that’s why you say the same things. It’s also nice to see RIDE being added to the russel 2000. A lot of money is going to be invested in order to cover the ETFs. I always thought burns was a sleazeball so maybe this can be a fresh start and the media narrative will start to change. I could see people starting to rally behind the American company and shifting it into a “come from behind” story lol. Some news articles already seem to have shifted their tones. Anyway, to all who have doubts—don’t buy. But don’t count them out just yet. Let’s see how their Lordstown week goes next week. I’ve noticed events like this tend to raise the share price so I bought myself some calls. I just hope all the bad news is out already!"
2021-06-16 16:29:17,wallstreetbets,"personally, i'm not going to waste my time anymore trying to explain things to close-minded parrots that get their jollies by picking their asses and then sniffing their fingers and congratulating each other for discovering the best perfume.

just like their shit, they're all focused on relics of the past like AMC and GME and don't seem to have any interest at all in the future.

i will however, devote some energy in a few months to come back with a hearty 'told ya so, assholes'"

1) 100,000 preside vehicles
2) $75 billion cash reserve
3) EV, but not too futuristic. Maybe JUST LIkE Tesla, but not.
4) $5 stock price, but should be $500.

This is a prerevenue play. The DD is there. The potential is their. #RIDEorDIE have rolled the dice and we believe all the pieces will fall in place. Yes, some are zealous, but that shouldn’t cloud the opportunity."

2021-06-16 18:23:10,wallstreetbets,I’m holding both WKHS and RIDE. They historically trade fairly close. When the average pickup truck driver gets behind the wheel of a 600hp EV with hub motors.. It’s on.

In the words of the great Consuela, “No”."

2021-06-16 16:15:18,wallstreetbets,Holy shit I knew you guys would be stupid enough to pump the most destined for bankruptcy stock on the market. For real man they just asked me to be their CEO.
2021-06-16 16:51:19,wallstreetbets,What would you like on your tombstone?
2021-06-16 18:33:43,wallstreetbets,Didn’t they just lose their CEO/CFO and are burning through all their cash. This stock could very well go to $0

2021-06-16 18:50:55,wallstreetbets,Didn't they just announced that they literally don't have the money to start production like last week? What changed?
2021-06-16 16:23:23,wallstreetbets,"Dogshit company, only hope is some larger company buys them out, which they wont. If they want any of the assets they will just pick them up cheap during bankruptcy lol.

Lets just pretend they didnt issue a going concern warning eh?"
2021-06-16 18:44:47,wallstreetbets,They file for bankruptcy by September

2021-06-16 16:55:46,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at 15, an average down two $11 cost basis. Just a week ago we were at $15. I am in until at least $20. I don’t know if you would call that a bag holder or not? I know some people that bought in originally at $30 a share, but even they were able to average down to about $12 or so. We were down to six dollars and some change for a while, it was a good buying opportunity to get that cost basis down. I guess to me, a bag holder is somebody who wants to get rid of it, like a negative thing, but most of us are confident that we are going to make decent money on this. And like I said, a lot of the people you see post about ride actually love the company. They are from Ohio and what not, or they just love green energy stuff. They might never sell it. At the least, I just don’t want to see people think that this is all some sort of scheme, If you could see through all the bullshit that’s out there, there is a lot of hope for the company"

Being the next Tesla is all good and amazing until you realize how close Tesla came to going bankrupt.

So far, it has been well worth it!"

VW is committed to spending $90B+.

But look here, RIDE has $400M and will be lucky to produce more than a few trucks before they run out of money."
2021-06-16 17:24:49,wallstreetbets,"Bro. Read the financials. It’s not enough money to get shit done on mass. They’ve got enough to pay themselves for another year. They do not have enough inventory or barely any. They need huge amounts more of cash they already burned through 350m. 

I can’t see it happening looking at the numbers. This is the biggest issue for ev starts up is cash.

400m cash on hand doesn’t tell the story. They haven’t even started and have no inventory to build them. Good luck anyway"
2021-06-16 19:40:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah I saw the quote. He wouldn't commit to what firm orders were. And feigned to not understand the legal definition involved.
2021-06-16 19:41:11,wallstreetbets,"No, but if I do. It will be the Silverado. From my local dealer. Where I buy and service all my vehicles. Who also have a courtesy fast charge station"
2021-06-16 19:16:01,wallstreetbets,I drive a pickup. I’ve also driven a performance Tesla. They’ll buy it because it’ll be fast and fun.
2021-06-16 19:36:24,wallstreetbets,Sure they will. I'm not talking about the rolling coal crowd. I'm talking about guys with enough money to own a 90k pickup to tow their toys or work equipment. Who can afford a second vehicle.
2021-06-16 19:59:31,wallstreetbets,"Because they announced it. Its not exactly hard to find where GM will be building any given vehicle.https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/apr/0406-factory0.html#:~:text=General%20Motors%20President%20Mark%20Reuss%20announced%20Chevrolet%20will%20introduce%20a,in%20Detroit%20and%20Hamtramck%2C%20Michigan."
2021-06-16 17:21:31,wallstreetbets,"I totally understand.  As a $RIDE shareholder and now as of last week a $WKHS shareholder, to me it makes great sense for $WKHS investors to upvote $RIDE posts on WSB and make  positive comments too.  There were 2 or 3 $RIDE posts on WSB today.  Again, if $RIDE goes up, $WKHS benefits.  THX!"
2021-06-16 16:55:11,wallstreetbets,">I bet they did it to TSLA too.

Tesla got slaughtered for years in the media. The overt hate for them really only just subsided."
2021-06-16 16:53:19,wallstreetbets,">Looks like were on our way to be like tesla 

Well, I hope so. But idiots on this sub somehow think I'm shorting their precocious $RIDE simply because I'm skeptical given the history and reality of how many automotive companies have failed."
2021-06-16 16:47:35,wallstreetbets,"It's no different, even for business. Brand loyalty, especially for trucks, is tall hurdle to get over. It's a competitive almost always fail market.

fwiw, I'm all for innovation and I hope they succeed and anyone that's invested makes boatloads of money.

edit: BTW, their endurance model is a ""fleet"" vehicle and they compare it to an F150 on their website. An F-150, the most brand loyal truck ever produced."
2021-06-16 16:46:32,wallstreetbets,Seriously be careful. There’s def a negative outlook out there but I’ve been following the stock for a while and a lot of it is bullshit. I wouldn’t risk it if I were you. Just stay neutral on it at least
2021-06-16 16:38:03,wallstreetbets,"You and your retard friend are losing money on your short positions huh?

Probably thought the CEO leaving was a bad thing?

$RIDE up 16% since Monday and closing higher everyday. Say bye to your money lol"
2021-06-16 18:39:52,wallstreetbets,GM spent 3.5B at the plant thats going to build Electric trucks alone. Just to prepare one plant.
2021-06-16 18:12:24,wallstreetbets,"Oh someone gets it. This is what investors are missing. 

RIDE are in deep and need more cash to execute. They are burning through cash and are going to run out in one year."
2021-06-16 19:43:14,wallstreetbets,"Right?! Company gets accused of lying, company assures public they did not lie and everyone is just, ""case closed!"" WTF do you expect the company to say."
2021-06-16 19:17:36,wallstreetbets,Idk all the diesel guys are big into diesel. They don’t even buy regular gas vehicles let alone electric. Maybe some super rich guys would buy im talking about all my fellow construction workers and country boys lol. They love puttin that black smoke out for whatever reason
2021-06-16 19:34:23,wallstreetbets,It won't be any faster or any more fun than the same brand name of pickup they always buy at the local dealer
2021-06-16 16:56:23,wallstreetbets,Well that is the same thing that’s happening now! Why can’t people see that?
2021-06-16 16:57:44,wallstreetbets,"And even if you don’t drink it, why can’t people at least be open to that idea? It makes a lot more sense when you say that they slammed Tesla too"
2021-06-16 16:58:17,wallstreetbets,Who are the failures youre comparing too? Just curious not trying to be a dick
2021-06-16 16:40:23,wallstreetbets,"I don't fuck with options really and have no more positions(had a few 06/18 calls on CLNE but sold already) I don't even have enough money to make those risks on a regular basis. I'm just not an idiot to the automotive world, unlike like most people in this sub.

If you can bet anything on a new automotive company, bet that it'll be bankrupt in <10 years. You and anyone else can know that if you choose to leave this casino of a sub long enough to start educating yourself on the subject matter.

There is SO much more to being a successful automotive company than being up in the fucking stock market on MONDAY. LOL"
2021-06-16 17:56:08,wallstreetbets,"And do you think a day is losing money on a short position? This company was doomed when that fuck CEO got a hard hat on and lied on national television, you’re the idiot that doesn’t realize this stock was $30 and going from 9-10 isn’t losing money Lmfaoooo"
2021-06-16 17:53:00,wallstreetbets,"Not short, just can read a balance sheet. This has a squeeze of 30% if you spam it all over the internet man , but this I can say with confidence will be zero by 2023."
2021-06-16 18:18:56,wallstreetbets,"RIDE has two big issues. One, they need more cash, the other, is there are many doubts about whether the in-hub motor design is a viable approach to build a pickup truck you can mass produce economically. The company can say what they want, but until they deliver something, the doubts will be there."
2021-06-16 19:20:28,wallstreetbets,I thought the same until I drove a powerful EV. The power is instant and country boys like saving money more than blowing smoke.
2021-06-16 16:58:03,wallstreetbets,">  Why can’t people see that?

I see it and I'm aware, but I tend to not see myself as an idiot and won't jump on the bandwagon just because my buddy says Lordstown motors will be the next Tesla.

My skepticism is due to the reality that almost every automotive company that has ever existed is now a relic of the past."
2021-06-16 17:01:07,wallstreetbets,"> why can’t people at least be open to that idea?

See the wiki article I linked in my other comment. There have been an **insane** number of promising auto manufacturers spring up with promises of changing the world. Almost all of them have failed."
2021-06-16 16:59:40,wallstreetbets,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States


*Only a list for US automakers."
2021-06-16 16:47:10,wallstreetbets,"Coming from the guy who hates Tesla and bought options on CLNE LOL. 

Yeah, I'll pass on your bullshit. 

EV is the future and RIDE will have 20,000 units on the road early next year. I don't see any other EV company doing that aside from Tesla and Ford. 

Again, good luck on your short positions. - You wouldn't be here hating so hard if you didn't have stake in the company. Sorry for your losses."
2021-06-16 16:49:50,wallstreetbets,Very true but what sold me was the ties with GM
2021-06-16 18:54:21,wallstreetbets,Their engineer said the wheel would break before the hub motors. Sharp guy. Listen for yourself https://zoom.us/rec/play/JKGhBmj4RVwa_70C4CVh3ewqWsbM0O4eqKf8Pq-o9VErMbsraijkRXTihv7gi-gMtNUvPgv6wm68SA7g.8W_hb7HN9rGJN_nw
2021-06-16 19:24:53,wallstreetbets,"I myself wouldn’t have a problem driving one, but I know a lot of guys I work with said they wouldn’t everyone one. But that could all change like you said if they test drive it"
2021-06-16 17:03:01,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn’t jump on the bandwagon either, to be honest, it’s been an emotional roller coaster. I really can see a world where they come out with this new technology, and they succeed. Especially if they really start production in September, they will almost have a corner on the market. However, it does seem unbelievable that a new company will come out and be successful, because like you said, the automotive industry is crazy. It’s a miracle they’ve even gotten this far. This stock isn’t for the faint of heart, it’s a big gamble. But it has the potential to really pay off in my opinion. Would I recommend it to anybody, probably not. I’ve had moments where I regretted it. However, things are starting to look up. A lot of the lies being spread are being proven to be false, and it looks like funding will be there."
2021-06-16 17:05:55,wallstreetbets,"I mean there’s a lot of things that sold me on it, I’m not gonna bother you with all the details, but the fact that they have that plant already was a big motivator for me. They seem to have backing from GM, so that was another motivator. I didn’t just blindly get it, at the end of the day, I still do have faith in the company. It has been frustrating to say the least, but I think they eliminated their problem was they got rid of burns"
2021-06-16 17:04:03,wallstreetbets,"No I agree with you 100%, that’s why you never hear of any new cars. It’s always in the same car manufacturers out there, I do get it. But if you end up picking the right one that comes out in a successful, it’s like a gold mine"
2021-06-16 17:04:43,wallstreetbets,"Almost all of those are from the early 1900s, some over 100 years ago"
2021-06-16 16:50:21,wallstreetbets,">bought options on CLNE LOL.

I made money on them so I don't really give a fuck what you think. Or is that not the goal of the stock market?

And I don't hate Tesla, the fuck did you get that from? I love those vehicles. Sexy as FUCK.

>Again, good luck on your short positions.

I like how you say I'm bullshitting but here you are completely making up your own narrative.

lol clowns

>You wouldn't be here hating so hard if you didn't have stake in the company

Stating a truth you aren't willing to accept isn't hating, dipshit."
2021-06-16 19:01:33,wallstreetbets,Did my comment say the hub motors will break? You are twisting my words.
2021-06-16 19:31:34,wallstreetbets,Yep. When people think EV the think Prius not something that will run 0-60 in 5
2021-06-16 17:05:47,wallstreetbets,"Like I said, I hope they succeed. I really do. Innovation is great. There's nothing worse than the old guard remaining the driving force forever."
2021-06-16 17:31:09,wallstreetbets,"Even if they start production, just take a look at WKHS and see what starting production looks like. It just means your cash burn is increasing. You don't get cash flow positive until your production numbers are way up. Heck, NIO produced 20,000 cars last quarter and is still losing money (and they lost $2.5B on operations the prior three years). Rich Schmidt on that Zoom call, himself said they will need to raise funds to increase production. This is not a company that is cornering any market anytime quick."
2021-06-16 17:07:28,wallstreetbets,">  But if you end up picking the right one that comes out in a successful, it’s like a gold mine

Exactly, like Tesla. Imagine getting in on their IPO. Fucking $17 a share."
2021-06-16 17:06:37,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and there's a reason for that."
2021-06-16 17:02:37,wallstreetbets,Damn this dude is mad lol.
2021-06-16 19:10:52,wallstreetbets,My bad.. On the video call the hubs application to a work truck are addressed at length in the video. Specifically the electrical connections. I’ve been a skeptic also.
2021-06-16 19:13:25,wallstreetbets,I see from your previous post you have a deep hatred for the stock. Chill the fuck out.
2021-06-16 17:06:31,wallstreetbets,I hear you
2021-06-16 17:08:17,wallstreetbets,"It really is a shame that, not only in the auto industry, but in pretty much every industry it’s just a few giant companies to control everything. And it’s almost impossible to get in to that good old boy group. You almost kind of have to like, join them in order to succeed. That’s why I’m kind of hoping they replace birds with a CEO that is part of that crowd, and they can maybe partner with GM or something, maybe become GMV haha. 
It is amazing what elon musk did, I give him a lot of credit"
2021-06-16 17:08:38,wallstreetbets,Right! And then imagine selling it for $900 a share
2021-06-16 17:10:00,wallstreetbets,"I wonder how many people became millionaires from Tesla? I’ll tell you one thing, there’s people on the sub Reddit for Lordstown that have like 50,000 shares for around $10 apiece. If it ever does go up to 40 or $50, they’re going to be rich. I’m sure it was the same with Tesla in the beginning. But I’m sure the institutions and headphones shook out all the retail investors early on, it only a few held strong"
2021-06-16 17:07:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah the reason is thats when cars first started coming out lol
2021-06-16 17:04:08,wallstreetbets,"Nah, randos on the internet would never upset me. I'm just frank."
2021-06-16 19:58:58,wallstreetbets,"Here are some issues that they forgot to address:

1. What is the cost of each hub motor
2. How much is the cost difference of building a pickup truck with a single rear chassis-mounted motor vs needing 4 hub motors for the Endurance.
3. Does the extra suspension tuning that was needed to deal with hub motors, result in more service issues and greater upfront cost?
4. What is the cost of reinforcing the truck frame to handle hub motors?
5. How much weight did they add to the truck to handle hub motors (this is in the Sullivan and Cromwell response to the short report, so I am not making up this stuff).
6. How many can they produce
7. How do they compare in electrical efficiency (i.e. miles per kWh's) to chassis mounted motors (taking into account the extra weight they added to the truck)
8. How much wear and tear do they add to the tires
9. How well do they perform (e.g. by the SF250 they averaged 20 mph over 40 miles which is very slow).
10. Are you more likely or less likely to have issues with 4 hub motors versus a single rear motor that connects to the rear tires via half-shafts?

There are more questions, but bottom line the electrical connections is the minor issue."
2021-06-16 17:47:24,wallstreetbets,"Bought my first shares about $60 per share. Selling? I did sell a few near $900 a share as I needed to diversify a bit, however I have no real plan on selling the rest of my shares anytime soon. Tesla is headed to a few thousand per share over the next ten years."
2021-06-16 17:09:06,wallstreetbets,"AND..... competition, brand loyalty and the cost to do business keeps new companies from succeeding."
2021-06-16 17:54:08,wallstreetbets,Holy shit! Congratulations brotha sounds like you’re set for a long time!
2021-06-16 17:51:02,wallstreetbets,Hopeless convincing the simps.
2021-06-16 17:10:47,wallstreetbets,Well there hasnt been alot of new companies to base that on given the list you provided
2021-06-16 18:00:27,wallstreetbets,It is okay. Not enough to retire yet.
2021-06-16 18:01:17,wallstreetbets,"Yea I guess depends on the amount of shares, but from 60-900 is quite the gain"

2021-06-16 16:22:03,wallstreetbets,"Wow this seems like a no brainer lol, had no idea they were getting into sports betting. Going to buy some 7/16 calls at open tomorrow, if this gets some traction on here I could see it exploding."
2021-06-16 16:22:33,wallstreetbets,DnB shares are already at pre-pandemic prices

2021-06-16 16:21:19,wallstreetbets,Dave and busters is also suffering what plagues any of those venues the hype dies off it’s also summer time when people want to be outside not in a dark bar/arcade
2021-06-16 16:27:01,wallstreetbets,"That’s true but most people, especially kids/teens, are sick and tired of staying at home and want to get out and socialize and interact w people irl. We’ve seen a huge “revenge spending” phenomenon occur across many sectors as america continues to reopen. Now that California is open again as well (where almost 12% of the country’s population lives) i can definitely see D&B having a monster summer."
2021-06-16 16:19:11,wallstreetbets,That’s how they get all their $$$ gotta look at it with a business perspective
2021-06-16 17:16:23,wallstreetbets,"Above pre pandemic prices.   I bought shares during the pandemic around $9-12 as a recovery play, and would have sold at it’s pre pandemic price but hung on to sell around 46, right before earnings, mostly for tax benefits.

I kept 100 shares too see where it goes and to write covered calls until I get called away.  I like PLAY, but this thing is probably ahead of its skis at the moment. Still bullish but they’ve got some growing to do first

Edit: fixed my typo"
2021-06-16 16:23:48,wallstreetbets,But this time it’s LOADED with shorts now and they are looking into sports betting services to enhance their business operations. Also what isn’t above pre-pandemic prices in the absolute bubble market 🤣

2021-06-16 16:35:25,wallstreetbets,"I just don’t see that happening with other parents, let alone a statically significant percent of them. People are vaccinated who are worried, and others who aren’t simply don’t care as much about covid so I definitely see this as a non-issue for an overwhelming majority."

Tell you what, YOU read it and give us the hot take! Make sure you fully explain why/how ""sad"" posts are most impactful!"
2021-06-16 17:29:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes. That is interesting. Good news, you can email ANY of them and ask them how they can do an analysis on reddit posts without mentioning DFV and his posts directly. 

We know that positive statements have different impacts than negative statements, and we know that the fear of losing (especially money) can be extremely impactful (see Prospect Theory and other works by Daniel Kahneman who has shown that investors feel losses more acutely than gains of the same dollar amount). 

What's interesting about this article (again, haven't read it yet, but based on abstract) is that fear isn't as impactful as sadness. So, we (our brains) seem to respond to ""sad"" posts more than others. 

DFV was a catalyst. He had been posting his GME theory (and investment) for months before others started jumping in. Something made that happen.

Now I agree, it would be  interesting to go back and see when his posts started getting more traction. It would be MOST interesting to see if it was due to a language change. Did he insert anger, fear, sadness, etc. into his posts that garnered everyone to start noticing more than they had been prior to this past January."
2021-06-16 16:57:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. I love that you guys ( r/wallstreetbets) have really thrown the entire book out the window...and I love that these guys are studying it like it's something they think they can understand.

If I’m not mistaken, DFV had been on about GME for over a year or so before it blew up and I agree, it would be interesting to see which factor(s) turned the sentiment because he got mostly shit in the start. 

Likely, the third step in Maslow's hierarchy of needs kicked in when it comes to sticking it to the man, here; the hedge funds. I feel that’s a given, and it just gained momentum from there."

A lot of people still try to compare monthly mortgages aren't ""that bad"" compared to the boomers for inflation forget that the boomers had that shit paid off in 20 years.

I can't stress how jealous I am. My parents worked part time and it paid for their entire state university tuition. Then they could buy a house for close to their average combined incomes (~40k each, bought a 90k house, worth 260k now).


To pull the equivalent today, a millenial couple would have to make 150k, each. Which is of course insane. And thus, the 30 year mortgage was born."

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23, 2020 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** leaps calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the price of **101.59** which gives us a total value of:

#$1,015,900

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

People say *""it was once in a life time dip""* blah blah, nonsense. If you bought just $10k in leaps during September dip you are already up more than $100k.

- C-218 bill is going to pass in Canada. 10B expected revenue for sure this is very low. 
- USA more states to get legalize by end of 2021. 
- NFL is coming 
- All those who passed by last year in advertise spending are push those stake options at draft kings this season. 
- higher oil prices here for atleast 6 months will push people to stay home. Not to drive to casino.
- Cathie woods loaded up after the short seller report more bullish than ever before."

2021-06-16 18:27:06,wallstreetbets,"Volcano watch: I've been following Clov closely for a while. Clov is on the cusp of a big eruption. Shorties have been trying to depress the price all week. The amount of short shares available has slowly been decreasing while the amount of short interest on those shares has been increasing. Volume is lowering, meaning Clovies are holding and there are fewer and fewer shares to short. (The new rule on banning naked shorts doesn't hurt either) 

With the lower amount of short volume and availability, (which plummeted today) the tremors start happening and the only way the price should start going now is 238k miles from the surface of this planet. There are a lot of option calls coming up due this Friday. The tug of war for those options and puts (shorted options) is around the $15 price. Shorties want it below that price as that will trigger more puts and less calls with attempts to put the price down further for an easier escape or attempt to shake the four-leaf cloved rainbow leprechaun wall also rumored to be guarded by unicorns. Shorties want the price around $11.

If Clov share purchases hit $15 Friday then we can again expect to see a very large tremor and gamma chain reaction like last week.  (Meaning options will be exercised aka more shares bought, because they are in the money, this isn't even the main eruption) A lot of options at $15 exercised will balloon into the higher option calls and we will see another Gamma Squeeze like last time the prices skyrocketed. This also also drive more put calls out of the money.

Hedgies will also have to purchase a new pairs of pants. I don't see how or why they wouldn't cover their short positions at that point, thus landing Clov safely on the moon with tendies to spare. Buy Clov while its still on the cheap. Share purchases will only make the inner core temperature hotter than it already is and add additional pressure that's already there. Clov is on countdown notice with or without your big Ape cheeks strapped in.

Even if the Gamma Squeeze doesn't produce fireworks as planned on Friday, the short squeeze will soon be inevitable. 46% of the share float on Clov is shorted. This is the highest shorted stock right now (or close to) and the magma pressure is very high right now. Clov is the biggest composite volcano at this point. 46% of the float is roughly 51.52 million shares. Meaning inevitably, those 51.52 will have to be purchased to cover. 

If the purchase these stocks at $15 a share, that's $772.8 million worth of tendie clovers being injected directly into this composite volcano's magma chamber. The average short purchase was around $7 a share so at the current moment, shorties are already deep in the red. They have been in the red for a while now and the interest rates are piling on. The Gamma Squeeze would be icing on the cake though. 

This is a company that is on the upswing either way and shorties are going to have to cover soon, with or without Ape bait. This is shown with the interest rates shorties are shevling out on shorts to keep the prices down. Do your own DD. This is not financial advice. I'll see you soon where Michael Jackson could only have dreamed of walking while dusting off clovers and unicorn poop."

If not, here's a few pointers.

 Make sure there isn't any major work that needs to be done, and that the appliances are all up to date, you don't want those going out on you while a tenant is there. 

Any renovations that need to be made or you want to make really will not increase the value of the house significantly so don't go crazy with these, and just hire someone to do them, it will save you time and headache.

 Also, don't buy right now. Market is too high. We're about to see a temporary dip in housing prices. That's your opportunity. Be quick because it won't last long as people are waiting for it and the glut will come right back. This information provided by my wife who is a title agent.

Also we bought a rental last September with telsa profit...all of the above were a fucking headache."

2021-06-16 17:48:59,wallstreetbets,"I think GM has more potential for big gains. Ford may be a bit safer. I'm not sure if ford has more in the works than they say, they seem to announce their new products long before they are finished. They have new broncos and they are offering the best selling truck in ev and an ev crossover (don't ask me to call it a mustang). Not sure how much of that is already priced in though. GM in my opinion has a much bigger chance of surprising everyone and releasing a bunch of new evs in the future. Given that some have called their full self driving developments among the top two along with google, with both being currently better than Tesla's fsd; I have a feeling they have a lot more in the works and they aren't showing all of their cards. Their sporadic partnerships with smaller ev companies casts some doubt on what they actually have already, otherwise what did they have to gain? So my take is ford is safer, GM has more risk but greater potential."
2021-06-16 17:43:20,wallstreetbets,"Honestly if tech is red tomorrow I expect gme to be green. I firmly believe investors are hiding in gme during downturns because of the amount of apes that just don't sell.

The short squeezes may also exasperate the correction of the broader indexes because institutions often hold treasuries and broad market ETFs and might need to sell them in order to cover inflated short positions. This is just a hypothesis and there's also a possibility they will tank way worse than the broader market because they're so overbought, but as of now I like the ape gang except for Canadian cannabis."

2021-06-16 16:20:07,wallstreetbets,My previous post explicitly states why you should give a shit about the bonds market. Algorithms trade largely based on the 10-year yield and the 10-year yield dictates mortgage rates and the interest rate at which money is borrowed in general across the world.

2021-06-16 16:05:32,wallstreetbets,I definitely am in the wrong career because I get paid pittance and could never buy like this
2021-06-16 16:06:13,wallstreetbets,you’ve already made my entire portfolio. Time to sell.
2021-06-16 16:25:51,wallstreetbets,Also congrats
2021-06-16 16:07:26,wallstreetbets,VRM is just getting started. Sold off because of a debt offering. Going to make them stronger and the debt offering was over subscribed. What does that say? And the conversion price on the shares is over $56. So plenty of upside.
2021-06-16 17:19:13,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I am hopeful. They fixed their inventory problem. Business model getting more efficient but trading at 1/7th the valuation to Carvana. Recent sell off due to conv offering. It was oversubscribed and decent terms. Pressured shares for hedging purposes. Think it’s gonna be a strong year for them and new car prices are going to stay elevated due to the chip shortage. Think a great Q3 trade.
2021-06-16 16:13:47,wallstreetbets,"yeah yeah, fuck you."

2021-06-16 15:55:41,wallstreetbets,Already bought ITUB calls today. Maybe shares tomorrow.
2021-06-16 16:07:03,wallstreetbets,"Just to make a few things clear (based off of some comments and questions I’ve seen)
1. Am I retarded? Of course I am. But you’re even more retarded for asking a question with such an obvious answer. 
2. Buying a pump and dump? Itaú is worth 60 billion dollars you jabronie. Pump and dumps don’t work with a company that large. 
3. Is it a guarantee? Of course fucking not. But it has nice asymmetry. And that’s the game we’re playing. Betting on asymmetrical situations"
2021-06-16 17:43:14,wallstreetbets,ITUB is cool but 5.28 BILLION float
2021-06-16 15:54:03,wallstreetbets,I’m in and I’m ready!!!
2021-06-16 19:58:28,wallstreetbets,I like it but...5.27B Float and 64B Market Cap?

2021-06-16 16:02:14,wallstreetbets,Buying the pump and dump ?
2021-06-16 16:09:47,wallstreetbets,Looking in the mirror right now.
2021-06-16 16:12:27,wallstreetbets,Não
2021-06-16 16:27:34,wallstreetbets,Glad to see I can finally post. I still can't post in AMC
2021-06-16 17:00:46,wallstreetbets,"I can see that. But what if you read it in my neutral central Florida accent, but in the moments where “fahking” and “jabronie” are said, it is with an ironically done terrible impression of a Boston accent"
2021-06-16 16:02:47,wallstreetbets,I 2nd this.
2021-06-16 16:38:53,wallstreetbets,I got lower strikes but same idea
2021-06-16 19:16:15,wallstreetbets,I have 50 calls...what’s a ten bagger?
2021-06-16 17:46:53,wallstreetbets,It definitely does have a large float. That’s the reason these “pump and dump” comments I’ve seen are ridiculous. You would need a tsunami of buying to pump it the way AMC and GME got pumped. But it’s entirely reasonable for it go up 30-40% in a month. When you’ve bought these cheap calls you make a lot of money if that happens
2021-06-16 16:00:27,wallstreetbets,Sim
2021-06-16 17:55:03,wallstreetbets,"look at this cuck's comment history, he's terrified of money"

2021-06-16 15:45:52,wallstreetbets,Then they should sell a cheaper version for people who are WILLING to watch these stupid fucking ads. Kinda like Amazon does/did with the Kindle
2021-06-16 15:59:17,wallstreetbets,For fucks sake.
2021-06-16 16:26:26,wallstreetbets,Just what my life was missing: more ads
2021-06-16 16:28:25,wallstreetbets,Oh cool I don't need to consider buying one now.
2021-06-16 15:43:58,wallstreetbets,"As someone who has an oculus Vr headset for my pc this makes me mega pissed.

Who was the fucking retard that thought this was a good idea from a consumer satisfaction point of view?"
2021-06-16 16:21:01,wallstreetbets,"Well if they're like billboards in a game, fine, but if I have to watch an ad before playing games or have banners pop up while playing then it just sucks out the fun"
2021-06-16 18:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Fuck Oculus.

Fuck Facebook.

and let us not forget Fuck the Zuck. What a piece of shit and I say that in a flattering manner."

2021-06-16 17:21:55,wallstreetbets,Good thing I didn't buy one when my meme dog mooned as I wanted to.
2021-06-16 19:55:35,wallstreetbets,"If Congress ever breaks up Facebook, I really hope Oculus becomes its own company to get away from this shit.

It’s actually a fantastic product, but a shame its parent company is so awful."

2021-06-16 15:32:56,wallstreetbets,XOXO- get some shares if you want a conservative play.

2021-06-16 15:29:39,wallstreetbets,More than I had two years ago and less than I had 6 months ago. about 5.4M if you inlcude what I paid in income tax this year.
2021-06-16 15:40:43,wallstreetbets,"I think it's a great long term play- even if it dips, a long hold is safe IMO."

2021-06-16 15:29:14,wallstreetbets,I'm prepared to hold- nothing has changed on the company except the stock price.
2021-06-16 16:00:01,wallstreetbets,Maybe after it starts picking up.
2021-06-16 15:35:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm just buying shares and leaps- I think it could see some more volatility, but I'm happy at these prices."

2021-06-16 16:00:41,wallstreetbets,OK.
2021-06-16 16:12:33,wallstreetbets,The DD is comments on 3-5 year estimates
2021-06-16 16:03:10,wallstreetbets,"Why didn't you just hold, it hit like 41.00 a few months back."
2021-06-16 16:41:03,wallstreetbets,"Wow, you lost money on a short term play. I didn’t think that was possible! It’s almost like there is risk involved...."

2021-06-16 15:58:44,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info. I'm keeping an eye on this one to see what happens.
2021-06-16 16:30:29,wallstreetbets,"just ordered 2 of those new pillows for $300 goddamn dollars. Anything to boost sales. :P

A pop to 15 would be great, but even a return to 13.50 would be nice.

2021-06-16 18:58:10,wallstreetbets,"who are you talking to? Are you telling other WISH investors to have diamond hands? Or are you telling yourself?

if it's the first option - This isn't necessary. It's every person for themselves out here. 

if it's the second option - This isn't necessary. Unless you need to publicly reaffirm your 9% gains to yourself. But that's weird"
2021-06-16 19:35:08,wallstreetbets,"First of all, nice $1k gain…  I haven’t looked into how valid this next statement is but not sure I need to. I don’t think they have more than 1% of previous buyers as recurring buyers. You only need to buy from them once to never do it again and that can only last for so long. One of the worst investments I could imagine someone being in. To be clear I said investments, not trades.

If you think a $1k gain is worth posting the. I feel bad for the $12k loss post you’re gonna post soon"

Which is a good thing because how people don't even need to leave their house to buy their silly trinkets and white elephant gifts.  My question is.. when did we start a world wide stimulus?   Sure the company is based in America but it's a global force.

2021-06-16 16:57:07,wallstreetbets,"So, I'm a little skeptical because it appears to me that Lion isn't as far ahead of its competitors in the states as I thought. The factory in Illinois I think will open up a lot of US opportunity for them, but many of the big names in the room haven't been sleeping on electric like the passenger car industry. Just look at the EM2, I mean, thats an electric version of arguably the most recognizable box truck in North America. And freightliner's parent company has been working on increasing charging capability by working with local power companies to see just how that could get done. We talking 1MW chargers for these bad boys.

So, I'm in Lion, 115 shares, but I don't know just how big they are going to get as these bigger better established names come out with competing class 6 and 8 trucks at the same time. I think Lion has a lot less of a first mover advantage than I originally thought. But it'll be fun to watch!"

The more spikes we have immediately following DD the further it reinforces that you have to get in and out quick. It’s a serious problem that’s only recently started but I see it getting out of hand very quickly.
2021-06-16 15:56:04,wallstreetbets,"OP at least looks like a legit redditor and investor.  

All three of these surges have begun literally minutes within the posting of the DD, though.  I'm not sure what to think of it.  

Are there algo's skimming the sub for DD tags on a set of tickers and/or of a certain length?  Are enough apes really just yolo-ing headlong into any DD that looks half serious?

I have no idea, it just really stretches credulity for it to happen the same way on three EV tickers in 24 hours.  Sus af, I think the kids say."

There are 10.5 million people here who can make their own decisions and collectively have substantial buying power. OP provided a well thought out DD. This wasn’t just “30% short float!! Buy!!!”
2021-06-16 17:05:08,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I’ve seen good DD on companies with actual value rocket the price in a pump and dump leaving price stagnant for the next two weeks. It’s ridiculous and I had looked into this company prior but will have to wait for things to cool off now. You know any private servers where DD is posted without millions of prying eyes?
2021-06-16 16:43:32,wallstreetbets,There are 10.5 million people watching with substantial buying power who are trying to get in early before the “next GameStop”. Couple that with some algo traders probably buying in based on sentiment scans. That’s what’s happening. I don’t think OP or a lot of the people are doing anything bad. I do think some of the posts (like the STEM one) are doing shady stuff with awards though.
2021-06-16 15:33:39,wallstreetbets,They’re are turning into pump and dumps even if that isn’t the intent.
2021-06-16 15:34:10,wallstreetbets,"I said it was PND since the stock was already pumped prior to the DD, so obviously the pump and dump group (which is criminal btw) had set up this one"
2021-06-16 15:33:23,wallstreetbets,Exactly!
2021-06-16 18:09:53,wallstreetbets,Yea i'd recommend waiting and not jumping on hype. I only mostly follow the SPAC subreddit so im not sure what is best really for good DDs.
2021-06-16 17:01:08,wallstreetbets,"they create fake hype for a 15 minute pump that allows them to sell with 100%-200% profits for every DD and anyone who isn't out quick enough gets fucked just as fast. 

This post had 15 awards gold and platinum within 15 minutes. Im sure they have sockpuppets or bots commenting the same shit in every thread too. 

LEV BGS GOEV GOGO WOOF ITUB LESL just a few i remember. They all follow the same format with key things bolded. Probably a team of people pumping up different tickers everyday and cashing out. 

If you don't think the SEC would come down on this for some bullshit reason like ""protecting retail investors from these pump and dumps and losing all their money"" well thats the only thing the SEC does is make rules for retail that fucks us over"
2021-06-16 15:37:11,wallstreetbets,I don’t think you know what a pump and dump is. Pump and dumps use misinformation to inflate an asset price so the OP can dump. What did he say that’s false or misleading?  Anybody can choose to buy or not. Just because people buy in and some people sell doesn’t mean it’s a pump and dump. And the amount of buying is a sign of the quality of his DD.  Not really any different than a new analyst report or price target update...
2021-06-16 15:39:36,wallstreetbets,the misinformation and illegal act is conspiracy with a group to collectively pretend they were convinced by the DD when they in fact already bought up the shares and options just prior to posting
2021-06-16 15:41:51,wallstreetbets,He disclosed he’s a share owner. Tell me: what did he do that’s different than a standard analyst report?  It doesn’t matter if a group owns shares before as long as it’s disclosed. It’s literally what analysts in investment banks do: release bullish reports on investments and why they own them. And unless he “pumped” the price with false or misleading information then he did nothing wrong.
2021-06-16 15:43:32,wallstreetbets,"the analyst doesn't work with a team to pretend that the report was amazing and that they're immediately buying shares when they already loaded up on them, this OP conspired with his or her group to spread that false information"
2021-06-16 15:45:54,wallstreetbets,Yes. They actually do work in teams. And they do own the asset when they publish the reports.  I agree that bots and shit like that can be illegal but merely owning a stock and releasing a report for why you own it (even if it moved the market) isn’t illegal.
2021-06-16 15:18:17,wallstreetbets,This is awesome. It's about time we start YOLOing PLTR I've been waiting for over six months for this to take off.  I hear PLTR IS THE FUCKING FUTURE that's what I've been told

I have about half as many shares and tons of leaps purchased around the $21 mark and am happy as hell.  The plan is to sell some of my 2022s and use the funds to exercise the lower strike ones around expiration, and then do the same when my 2023 ones come closer to expiration.  I'm betting by that time, they will be extremely deep ITM."

2021-06-16 15:12:36,wallstreetbets,I just checked the CLOV subreddit… why do so many of the accounts there say they were created 139 days ago?  What happened 139 days ago?  Am I being cynical when I say that’s suspect af?

2021-06-16 14:46:46,wallstreetbets,You should ask the WSB pumpers for example /u/Runner20mph 🤡
2021-06-16 14:47:37,wallstreetbets,Oh. You were supposed to sell that at opening on the 9th.

2021-06-16 14:37:40,wallstreetbets,Still it is on  the top of short interest list.

2021-06-16 19:00:01,wallstreetbets,U can still sell it and buy a few cookies
2021-06-16 15:07:13,wallstreetbets,"Generally speaking, and true 99.9999999999% of the time, if a stock is up 400% in a week, it's going to go down.  Especially if they didn't have some kind of game changing news.

Small biotechs that get an FDA approval for a novel new drug with no competition can pull off a move like that.  A meme stock, that had no change in fundamentals, can't sustain it"
2021-06-16 15:10:09,wallstreetbets,"If you're getting in after that kind of run up, better buy a pile of puts to hedge that moon bet.

Now OP can take a loss or sell covered calls and wait to see if another wave of pumping is coming."

2021-06-16 15:20:10,wallstreetbets,Done that a few times.  Missed by a penny once before a 15% drop.  Fuckin hate when that happens
2021-06-16 17:55:49,wallstreetbets,It’s not even a true statement… what is wrong with making a quick buck on these meme stocks? GME is a sleeping beast sure but does that mean we should ignore easy opportunities?
2021-06-16 15:24:12,wallstreetbets,Seems like you are holding a big CLOV bag. Weather the storm or just drop the bag.
2021-06-16 14:57:14,wallstreetbets,More like dump n dump

2021-06-16 16:19:29,wallstreetbets,I don't think that's a good strategy to make money.  You wanna *checks notecard* buy low and sell high?
2021-06-16 14:58:15,wallstreetbets,Minimum loss on a stock that sank like the titanic. Nothing wrong with minimizing loss on a bad decision. From a business standpoint it’s a smart move. Take emotions out of it. 😂. Difference between being down 2.5% and being able to buy back in at a lower price point than down 30% for fuck sake.
2021-06-16 15:17:22,wallstreetbets,"Was gonna say “nobody tell him.” When you see 100% that fast, yah. 

And you pointed out 400%. 😂"
2021-06-16 15:22:38,wallstreetbets,Good for you at least i did not buy it at 28+. So still have a hope to recover by next week
2021-06-16 17:46:15,wallstreetbets,Honestly pure luck. I've had it since April and almost sold just to break even. I do know one thing. Never chase a stock.
2021-06-16 16:23:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes. A stop loss is basically saying ""yes, I'd like to sell but the current price is too high. Once it drops some more THEN I'll sell"""

2021-06-16 16:16:57,wallstreetbets,After 2022 elections of course.
2021-06-16 14:52:39,wallstreetbets,I’ve bet on inflation. Shorting Treasury bonds and long on TIPS. I don’t think FED is willing or able to really react even if inflation hikes.

2021-06-16 17:51:12,wallstreetbets,"I think the interest rate will hike in 2022, look at their forecasted inflation rates between 21-22. It has the steepest drop of their forecast, and this doesn't align with any of their expected monetary policy projections.

2021-06-16 15:16:37,wallstreetbets,"Back in March the Fed did some math and determined that every $1 you had on January 1st would only be worth $0.98 by December 31st. Well the Fed double checked their math this week and realized your shit will only be worth $0.97 now.

Higher inflation rates tend to have a negative impact on stock prices. The Fed is using the term “transitory” to indicate that they don’t believe higher inflation rates will last very long. It’s their way of telling the market “don’t worry about it”."

2021-06-16 15:59:28,wallstreetbets,"I think that whole ""higher interest rates makes it more costly for companies to borrow and grow""[1] is a bunch of bullshit. What it actually does is make margin borrowing more expensive so people sell their stonks. When stonks go down (which isn't supposed to happen) people sell, and they go down more. 

When everyone's over-leveraged to their tits, any whiff of higher interest is an international disaster.[2]

Edits:
[1] with the magnitude of rates being discussed. 
[2] 0.5% doesn't make simple borrowing that much more expensive, but if you're triple leveraged or 100x leveraged like Archegos, it's a huge disturbance"

2021-06-16 17:23:34,wallstreetbets,"Hiking rates does fix supply shortages (to some extent) by reducing aggregate demand

The fed is basing their assumptions on the labor market shortage being temporary. I don't think this is the case. Even if it is temporary a shortage in the labor market can have long lasting inflationary effects.

Because labor prices are a major component of goods and services costs any material increase means that prices for goods and services must go up in return. With higher prices for end products, workers demand higher wages. This effect can persist even after supply/demand in the labor market rebalances."

2021-06-16 15:05:00,wallstreetbets,"It is a complete joke. We’ve been living in a fantasy even before we completely parted ways with fundamentals because the fed hasn’t been using accurate inflation metrics for decades now. Anyone watching the housing market knows that real inflation is already out of control, but it isn’t represented in CPI because they use “owners-equivalent-rent” rather than actual price sales-pairs method to represent housing. And it doesn’t capture the mammoth healthcare cost increases either.

They’ve just been using voodoo to claim that inflation is still lower when true measures estimate between high single digits and low double digits in the past decade."

2021-06-16 19:21:54,wallstreetbets,Long term valuations have rate hikes and higher yields taken into consideration. It's when the yields get higher than say 2% and when inflation stays above 2% for a long period of time that those valuations suffer.
2021-06-16 16:35:50,wallstreetbets,"Eh, no. 


It's both. 


Lower interest rates means that any company planing any project needs very little margin for it to be profitable.  If your interest rate is 5, you only need 10 per cent to gain a 5 per cent benefit. 


If the rate is 15, you need at least a 15 per cent just to break even."
2021-06-16 17:20:00,wallstreetbets,"You're exactly right. Lower rates also mean less lending from banks, this is why banks are doing poorly and nonbanks/fintech (which are not regulated in the same way, have lower capital requirements, and are more unstable) are growing so rapidly. Nonbanks now control more capital than banks.

That's why everything is so volatile, we've thrown price stability out the window.

See: Karen Petrou"
2021-06-16 16:25:27,wallstreetbets,"Either way, higher interest rates hurt stock prices. Unfortunately, so does higher inflation (which we have). The problem now is that Fed will need raise rates to combat inflation.

It’s pretty much a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” situation."
2021-06-16 18:02:57,wallstreetbets,"What it does is it makes earnings yield worse, and thus lowers valuation. Imagine you have 7% earnings yield with 0% rates. Now rates go up 1%. Suddenly your yield is now only 6% over risk-free yield. In theory your stock should drop 15% to reflect that lower not-risk-free return.  

I mean, why would you pay the same price from something that now yields 15% less when adjusted for risk?"
2021-06-16 19:41:24,wallstreetbets,It’s like no one has ever built a DCF on this sub

2021-06-16 18:10:16,wallstreetbets,wont people exiting the job market give us deflationary pressure?
2021-06-16 17:37:01,wallstreetbets,The market will work itself out if the government lets it. But if government keeps trying to get involved (extended juiced up unemployment) it is driving aggregate demand higher which is driving inflation. The fed has ben going crazy with the money printer for over a decade and we had no inflation. It was only when the government started handing cash to people instead of corporation and at the same time shut down the services economy (meaning stimulus could only be spent on goods) did we get a slightly higher inflation.
2021-06-16 15:09:09,wallstreetbets,"Inflation isnt a problem, unless you want to buy something."
2021-06-16 17:14:01,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking about housing/rent prices going on now and thought, what if the big banks are scared of high number of borrowers defaulting on their mortgages due to the pandemic ?
What if they decided they can simply buy up the inventory using fed’s free money to jack up the price so borrowers now have equity to utilize and not default on mortgages?

I understand supply shortages high demand, foreign investment and all that going on now but what if the bank themselves is creating this to protect themselves and even make profit from it?

Nothing to lose for the banks. 
Borrow free money. Buy inventories. High risk borrowers sell home or pay mortgages from more debt, people FOMO and pay 15% higher bid to buy, bank can rent out at high price… 
 
It’s going to be hard to ask the government to bail them out like 2008, so they are finding a new way to protect and profit ?

Just a wild thought i had yesterday."

2021-06-16 19:28:28,wallstreetbets,"If the thesis about transitory inflation is correct, and it looks like it is based on the recent CPI data (used cars accounting for most of the increase for example), then you don't need to raise rates to combat that inflation.

They think they will need to increase rates in 2023 because they think we will have a very low unemployment rate and an economy that is firing on all cylinders, and in that case, it's more of a pre-emptive against inflation by slowing down the economy before it overheats."
2021-06-16 18:47:18,wallstreetbets,So no matter what they do stonks will go... DOWN?!
2021-06-16 17:47:39,wallstreetbets,"It's because people actually spent the money they got.

It's not that there has been no inflation, it's that all the dollars are locked up where they can't touch the real goods market. It's all either in AAPL size warchests or getting moved around rich billionaires through things like the market and credit swaps. They aren't spending their billions on heinz ketchup, so the price of tomatoes doesn't go up.

2021-06-16 17:37:14,wallstreetbets,"You are very close, but it wasn’t the banks who created this artificial mess - it was our lovely government (although it *is* effectively owned by the banks and corporations). 

After ‘08, what should have been done is to allow the housing prices to crash down to a realistic level dictated by the consumer market, and bail out the homeowners duped by banks in the early to mid 2000s.

Instead, the government bailed out the banks and created an incentive program in 2012 to encourage banks to buy up all the available real estate to drive prices back up. That’s what lead to this and why a large part of this housing crisis isn’t just lack of supply - it’s that investors now own a massively outsized portion of our housing. That’s why you hear about all these all-cash offers. https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/single-family-landlords-wall-street/582394/

2021-06-16 19:25:52,wallstreetbets,"Not for growth stocks, it does not. The reason being is that growth stock P/E valuations are based on revenues and margins in the future, like 2030. They assume a level of inflation of around 2% for their models. When inflation is higher, the value of that revenue in 2030 is less so the current P/E becomes over valued and gets hammered."
2021-06-16 19:15:14,wallstreetbets,"I wasn’t very clear in my comment but I was speaking more about higher than expected inflation vs simply high inflation. So I agree, high Inflation, by itself, isn’t necessarily a negative for the markets."

2021-06-16 15:58:16,wallstreetbets,"We all get grumpy sometimes. Its reddit though, and people will give you shit if you take it out on someone if they didnt deserve it. Its what I love about reddit. Everyones so critical of eachother that it really helps produce quality content."

2021-06-16 14:41:29,wallstreetbets,"It takes 3 days just to deposit 250 into the account.

Can't imagine how long you had to deposit till you reached that amount"

2021-06-16 19:48:39,wallstreetbets,You paid currency conversion fees on this when you buy and when you sell. You're truly a retard.

2021-06-16 14:45:36,wallstreetbets,You can deposit as a lump sum so takes 4 days.

2021-06-16 15:53:52,wallstreetbets,Canadian ape as well. Balls deep in meme stocks.  Started with Gme and it's still 70% of my portfolio.
2021-06-16 14:02:02,wallstreetbets,It was just 1 but it was my very first ever stock. Got caught up in the hype train like an idiot too late. It got me into the game and learning though. I'm making much better investments now and my meager starting 2k dropped down to about 700 the first month hah. Clawed it back up to 2100 now.

2021-06-16 14:06:41,wallstreetbets,Indeed. Got in on clov for %100 gain and sold before it plummeted despite being called paper handed hah. Only wish I bought more at the time.

2021-06-16 17:08:27,wallstreetbets,This isn’t my first rodeo. I held bb all the way down to below $8 last time while buying to avg down and I’ll fuckin do it again if I have to. Nobody gonna convince me bb is fairly valued compared to cloudstrike and palantir.
2021-06-16 15:39:07,wallstreetbets,I keep adding to the dip! Lol.
2021-06-16 18:10:35,wallstreetbets,holy shit just stop buying contracts. buy shares.
2021-06-16 15:41:34,wallstreetbets,Same boat but I like the stock. Feeling good about the price in the future.
2021-06-16 14:27:40,wallstreetbets,I jumped on board probably after most of y’all… but didn’t this happen a lot with AMC as well? Are y’all giving up hope on BB or think it can easily overcome this??
2021-06-16 18:37:34,wallstreetbets,I will just hold
2021-06-16 18:42:17,wallstreetbets,I bbelieve in this shit. Maiby not today but once it will blow fucking wallstreet

2021-06-16 13:48:15,wallstreetbets,It was an obvious pump n dump.
2021-06-16 14:24:11,wallstreetbets,And buying more if it dips to $12. BB aint scared.
2021-06-16 16:46:49,wallstreetbets,Patience and shares and leaps=profits
2021-06-16 19:00:22,wallstreetbets,What about compared to FireEye and Symantec? Why compare to crowdstrike and palantir?
2021-06-16 17:57:59,wallstreetbets,But it keeps dipping 🙃
2021-06-16 14:47:12,wallstreetbets,"Going to say this knowing the risk of being downvoted. 

BB spiked on no news, there is currently nothing to help it maintain or even pump any further until something good happens with the company. Before the resting point for bb was $8-9. It’s currently looking exactly like it did in January and slowly bleeding back down. While bb is a “meme stock” we do not shoot up like amc or gme or any of the others for some reason. And we seem to tank the hardest."
2021-06-16 14:25:24,wallstreetbets,Any volatility can trigger crazy increase demand for options OTM. You can make substantial gains and never be anywhere near the strike price. Even a .06 price to a .16 value in volume can really add up. I was looking at some as well. I would have no intention of holding them until 40.
2021-06-16 13:54:21,wallstreetbets,He doesn't. He's playing the sorta long game in hopes the stock will rise substantially and he can sell premiums before expiration.

2021-06-16 13:50:11,wallstreetbets,It was a pump and dump because some jackass bought at high prices thinking it would go 3x in price and he lost money? What a true fucking idiot
2021-06-16 15:39:44,wallstreetbets,Nah BB was an OG meme stock
2021-06-16 18:08:18,wallstreetbets,That’s why I straddle my cost down.
2021-06-16 16:18:45,wallstreetbets,"Always speak thou mind…regardless of others opinions, beliefs and downvotes."

2021-06-16 19:58:14,wallstreetbets,"no downvote here.

i agree ,nevertheless im holding the shares i currently have .

im restarded like that."
2021-06-16 16:45:20,wallstreetbets,"Disagree. Management re-org, semi shortage likely to ease, reopening allowing sales teams ti go boots on ground, bb service offerings launched and most importantly, leaving q1/q2 behind which were always anticipated to be too early for the real excitement."
2021-06-16 15:55:08,wallstreetbets,"I have bb leaps in 35, 40 and 45. They were all up to almost $7 a contract a few weeks back. I imagine we'll have some random ass spike in another 2-3 months. Seems to BB the norm"
2021-06-16 13:55:58,wallstreetbets,That’s a risky bet
2021-06-16 15:13:22,wallstreetbets,They have the saddest comment history I’ve ever seen.
2021-06-16 17:54:27,wallstreetbets,I watch on bad days and wait for them to come in to the .05 range and try and scoop em up too. Good luck!
2021-06-16 13:56:24,wallstreetbets,Fuck yea it is. Options are risky.
2021-06-16 17:56:25,wallstreetbets,"I am retard, I bought during the last upshot😭😭 paid like $3 each. Now I'm just trying to get more while there cheaper"
2021-06-16 17:56:56,wallstreetbets,"Well that was for 2023, I think 2022 was like 1.5"
2021-06-16 13:42:37,wallstreetbets,I'm jealous of everyone. Why can't it be me.
2021-06-16 14:56:17,wallstreetbets,"Wish this had been on my radar sooner. It was flat-lining around $10 until late last year then went on a run up to the $40s in Dec. That would have been a nice ride. Dropped back to sub $20 earlier this year, and has been bouncing around the $20s ever since. Starting to get more coverage and could have good upside. Sub $20s would be a nice BTFD price with upside. But the sub $20s ship might have already passed now."
2021-06-16 13:51:17,wallstreetbets,Congrats bruv
2021-06-16 17:43:53,wallstreetbets,How we feeling about tomorrow bois?

2021-06-16 14:43:40,wallstreetbets,Could you pls explain
2021-06-16 15:08:42,wallstreetbets,"You realize there’s a typically unlikely or impossible move the market has not priced in, you bet money and make a ridiculous return."
2021-06-16 19:41:31,wallstreetbets,Where to look for these moves? Do you use the options flow ?
2021-06-16 13:36:22,wallstreetbets,Super illiquid. This seems dumb. I'm in

They literally haven’t even hit most states and they’re year over year growth is almost 70%. I’m not looking to pump and dump like I did with your mom, this is an actual investment looking forward."
2021-06-16 15:33:27,wallstreetbets,Whats the difference between DKNG and that guys mom?  You can pump and dump DKNG and it won’t follow you around for three weeks afterwards 🙌🏼
2021-06-16 15:48:13,wallstreetbets,also you sound like your 13 years old who doesn't know anything when it comes to business
2021-06-16 15:46:32,wallstreetbets,you're a dumbass clearly.  DKNG already put out their 10 year full guidance where they expect to be a few months back and it doesn't even justify a share price over $50.

Also, the ITUB that we're trading has some foreign exchange exposure, and the USDBRL exchange rate is breaking down through the important 5.000 level.   


So if we can get a breakout to the downside in USDBRL and a breakout in the upside for ITUB4, it's like rocket fuel for ITUB."

If the stock price is say $6.50. You bought a call for $8 strike price. Break even is $8.06. Would it need to go above that for you to finally start making profit?

Thank you for responding."
2021-06-16 18:29:50,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but the profit is higher."
2021-06-16 18:50:46,wallstreetbets,Correct. But if it were to run up a lot your return on your invested capital (the premium you paid) is going to be higher. Higher risk higher potential reward

2021-06-16 13:12:30,wallstreetbets,Still pissed I didn’t go in harder. I almost went 15k deep and decided it was too much at the last min. DUMBBBB 🐓
2021-06-16 14:01:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’d agree with you. Tesla got lucky leading the charge for EVs in the public eye, but right now they just can’t compete with more established companies with more resources like Ford. Ford is gonna be their biggest competitor right now, and if they can’t find a way to produce lower cost EVs for more of the general public Ford will have them beat."
2021-06-16 18:56:51,wallstreetbets,When will you understand that Tesla is not just a car company?
2021-06-16 13:07:47,wallstreetbets,Dont be pussy
2021-06-16 13:56:01,wallstreetbets,Why? As mainstream companies with vastly more resources vomit to ev transitions won't they lose their niche? I'd expect they would dip significantly
2021-06-16 12:54:37,wallstreetbets,Random shout out
2021-06-16 15:04:35,wallstreetbets,"Dude... that’s fucked

Also it’s not gain if you haven’t sold.  Just potential"
2021-06-16 13:15:57,wallstreetbets,"I know.  I forget my initial $. But it was low. Probably like $100. Because I was still learning the market. & i think i brought as part of the IPO.

I also tried to convince mom to let me borrow 5K to buy Google IPO (I hadn't gotten my paycheck yet). I still wanna kick her ass for that one."
2021-06-16 14:05:43,wallstreetbets,The only way Tesla stays relevant is buying up smaller ev companies to expand and make more low cost options. All the mainstream releases I'm seeing over the next couple years are starting 40k. If they can't undercut that people will opt for brands they know and trust. Shoot I'd have to drive 3 hours to the nearest Tesla dealer but 10 minutes to a Ford. And I've owned a Ford before.
2021-06-16 14:03:26,wallstreetbets,Puts on Tesla then?
2021-06-16 19:59:57,wallstreetbets,Tell me more about their roof solar panel Enterprise.
2021-06-16 13:21:30,wallstreetbets,"""Pussies get fucked by dicks... and assholes like to shit on everything but dicks also fuck assholes!"" -Team America"
2021-06-16 14:28:36,wallstreetbets,"Nope, the advancement from the engineering standpoint done by Tesla is already 5-10 years ahead compared to the company that is *transitioning*. Yes, Apple or any other company may develop the prototype of new EV(I bet it won't be better than Tesla) in 2-3 years, but they won't be able to achieve the manufacturing/production rates. 

Sounds crazy, but in 5 years, 95% (my prediction) of a Tesla vehicle will be autonomously built and assembled by the machines only (less and less human interaction). Moreover, the process of manufacturing will look like the production of hot wheels cars."
2021-06-16 14:11:17,wallstreetbets,"Yup, exactly. Tesla and Musk just got lucky, getting in on EVs early. But if they can’t do *anything* to release vehicles at a lower price point they just don’t stand a chance. The Lightning is most likely cheaper, probably looks much better to the average customer, and is from a reliable brand."
2021-06-16 14:32:53,wallstreetbets,Heh sure. Remind me in 5 years.
2021-06-16 15:05:34,wallstreetbets,"I don't think he got lucky at all, the guy sunk millions into that company to prevent it from going under, it was more like he kept beating a wall with his fists until it broke down."
2021-06-16 16:42:19,wallstreetbets,"I think youre forgetting Tesla's charging network, which is kinda the only reliable way to charge an EV. Ford will need to come up with something to compete."
2021-06-16 16:50:32,wallstreetbets,"Just got lucky? Lol. Tesla’s mission was/is to accelerate the move to sustainable transport. And they’ve achieved that. I strongly doubt we’d be seeing the other automakers this far along on EVs if not for Tesla showing it could be done, and even more than that, making it cool."
2021-06-16 14:16:26,wallstreetbets,"From what I can tell they are fairly comparable in price at different trims. But yeah, most people will prefer a brand they know and a look that's familiar."

2021-06-16 13:24:14,wallstreetbets,Oshkosh just received a 900 million contract to add weapons to military vehicles. Oshkosh is the company that works with the government proven contractor.
2021-06-16 12:32:37,wallstreetbets,Thought they tried this already and gave up lol. Isnt workhorse the one whos prototype went outta control and got the postal service test driver hurt cause he had to bail outta the truck?

2021-06-16 13:16:41,wallstreetbets,This could easily be the biggest play since GME. Fuck off shills
2021-06-16 13:40:17,wallstreetbets,"Let's honestly look at this from an objective perspective:

1) What is the legal basis for the challenge? Workhorse lost a contract. USPS is a corporation that has no obligation to award to Workhorse. Even under the assumption of possible impropriety by DeJoy, Workhorse has no guarantee or reason to be awarded the contract, even in the rare event that the legal challenge somehow voided the contract (which is not likely). There is no legal standing for this helping Workhorse. It could fuck Oshkosh, but nothing about this helps Workhorse. 

2) Legal fees. WKHS does not have the liquidity to fight this in the courts. If the USPS even remotely attempts to defend themselves, which they will, WKHS runs the risk of millions in legal fees that they can scarcely afford. They're already struggling with funding and production and they have a 2.0 Debt ratio. They are swimming in debt and have no product. 

3) If history is any indication, the USPS doesn't like emerging technology and wants something reliable and known. Whomever takes over should this cause DeJoy's firing is immensely unlikely to reward this move. Oshkosh's platform, which is a joint venture with Ford, can be fully electric, but also is based on the existing Transit van platform. There are severe limits to the deployment of electric trucks in rural areas due to infrastructure that just isn't there. USPS is a risk averse business and won't award WKHS.

I *will* place long puts on this stock if it spikes. WKHS has no chance of this lawsuit being successful.

Edit: These challenges are immensely common and are almost always closed out https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-281sp"
2021-06-16 13:13:50,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they are challenging it because otherwise without it they aren’t much of a company to begin with. Besides, Oshkosh is making a portion (and possibly 100%) of these vehicles electric as a compromise between DeJoy and the democrats"

2021-06-16 12:52:53,wallstreetbets,"So they were put through a lot of requirements and specifics, and then suddenly all that was tossed and it was awarded to a gas powered vehicle. The night before this was announced someone bought 50 million dollars of that company in one trade. Literally the entire day of trading in volume in one trade. It is highly suspected that DeJoy (head of USPS) himself is responsible. He is currently under investigation for other fraud."

2021-06-16 13:28:43,wallstreetbets,"They certainly are, but they are not a proven electric vehicle manufacture, which is what all these requirements  were before they won the contract. They have suggested that they can make some of the vehicles easy to convert someday should the USPS wish, as a haphazard way of making this seem legit. They have further said that MAYBE they can make 10 percent of them electric."

2021-06-16 14:55:38,wallstreetbets,"Biden's desire to make the fleet electric means nothing. He can't force the USPS board to do anything. He could replace them with minions, but he'd never do it in time. Even if DeJoy leaked insider trading to his buddies, it means nothing to the award of the contract if the board made the decision. 

Secondly, the USPS works in many places without access to infrastructure for electric vehicles. Biden's lip service does nothing to eliminate the massive headwinds that WKHS would face to make that system work for the USPS."
2021-06-16 15:40:32,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.

2021-06-16 14:06:58,wallstreetbets,"While I continue to research. I would like to debunk assumption number one. USPS is an independent agency of the Executive Branch of the United States federal government and not simply a corporation. This changes a lot. “A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action ... is entitled to judicial review thereof. An action ... seeking relief other than money damages ... shall not be dismissed... on the ground that it is against the United States.”
5 U.S.C. § 702"
2021-06-16 13:16:44,wallstreetbets,"They have an 8k vehicle back order without the USPS deal, this isn't some garage start up yoloing on a contract. The fact that they were able to be in the top 3 for an 8 billion dollar contract should make that clear."

2021-06-16 12:55:56,wallstreetbets,This is big facts. I bought in on wkhs months and months ago at 30$ and believed the companies motto. Tbf this whole fiasco with usps is eerily similar to less favorable treatment….
2021-06-16 13:42:05,wallstreetbets,"None of this voids the contract awarding. USPS is an independent corporation under the executive that has no obligation to award WKHS anything.

DeJoy could get screwed. Oshkosh could have the contract pulled (extremely unlikely). But none of this awards WKHS shit and they will have tremendous legal fees incurred to fight this.

Ultimately, WKHS's platform has to be proven. Since this is not an apples-to-apples bid, they can have any number of additional requirements placed on them by USPS to ensure that the 10-year process is feasible. These are requirements Oshkosh doesn't have to meet due to the nature of the varying platforms.

I am not seeing anything that supports WKHS standing a chance in this case. I'll be surprised if it isn't thrown out by fall."

2021-06-16 16:50:21,wallstreetbets,Not all of us came 🥺
2021-06-16 13:34:44,wallstreetbets,They don't have to be an electric car producer they just need to carry out the contract on a set price. If osh buys a company or has a company make those cars the government doesn't care as long as they can produce what they say.
2021-06-16 13:46:21,wallstreetbets,"Oshkosh is partnered with Ford, who IS a proven electric vehicle contractor."
2021-06-16 12:34:26,wallstreetbets,"No, ride wasnt part of the postal service contract bidding as far as i know."
2021-06-16 15:12:05,wallstreetbets,I was pointing out the possible insider trading but okay.
2021-06-16 15:51:33,wallstreetbets,"Executive Order, not suggestion or request.  Your also arguing that high initial cost outweighs staggeringly higher efficiency over the life of the vehicle, which seems silly to me because overhauling systems particularly infrastructure has always been costly."
2021-06-16 13:48:54,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, find me a case where a legal challenge to a bid directly awarded the bid to the people bringing up the challenge. Nothing is going to happen. This lawsuit is frivolous."
2021-06-16 14:42:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this statement is that they're entitled to sue and the US can't dismiss it just because they're suing the US. Read your own quote. Literally nothing says that there is a legal wrong in awarding the contract elsewhere. They have to prove that there was an illegal action taken during the bid process directly related to the bid evaluation *THAT LED TO THE CONTRACT BEING AWARDED*. That is a monumental task. Not only is DeJoy's possible insider trading not relevant (considering the award was almost guaranteed as a board decision), but it doesn't change anything about the contract's awarding. Even if they prove it, the decision to award the contract would almost assuredly still stand. 

Secondly, while it is a part of the Executive branch, it is an independent ""corporation"" within the US government (thank your republican members of senate). This means the contract was almost assuredly a BOARD DECISION. Even government contracts have no obligation to award WKHS or anyone else and ANY non-apples to apples bid can be scrutinized under the bid process. I have literally done dozens of government bids. They ask questions and clarifications and put stipulations on what you do. It's par for the course."
2021-06-16 13:39:20,wallstreetbets,"WKHS produced 38 vehicles in Q1 and only delivered 6. If they somehow win this contract, they’d be on the hook for delivery of 420 vehicles every month on average, and that’s the minimum. WKHS might be viable as a provider of last-mile or other delivery vehicles in the future, but this is way past their paygrade, and ultimately why they were probably passed on in the first place."
2021-06-16 13:45:36,wallstreetbets,"They've produced 50 vehicles in the last 2 years and less than 500 since their creation in 2007.

They stand no chance to get this contract."
2021-06-16 13:32:29,wallstreetbets,Boiler rooms don't pump sucessful companies.
2021-06-16 15:47:19,wallstreetbets,"Even if workhorse has no intention of vying for the contract now the matter of them showing damages is nonsensical. All the contract work in motion with Oshkosh means they cant debate the value, its static and confirmed. Workhorse will be suing for the loss value of the contract, and have an easy case with Dejoy being planted at USPS to sabotage it. Dejoy taking over, work horse losing the contract happen very close. Given the contract in question is already in motion elsewhere, its a matter of workhorse showing they lost out on that contract despite meeting all the benchmarks set out. This happened in plain view of the public, so proving it wont be hard. The more Dejoy is investigated, the more his corruption will snowball but it cant be surprising when the man was put there to make it not work."
2021-06-16 18:35:36,wallstreetbets,SHORT ALERT!!!!!!!
2021-06-16 17:42:49,wallstreetbets,"50 Democratic Congress persons have signed and sent a letter to Pelosi and Biden protesting the award to OHS.  Biden promised an electric Gov't vehicle fleet during his run.  One of the main excuses for the USPS going with OHS and gas was because Electric was too expensive and there is currently a Bill in circulation to award the USPS with $8 billion to pay for an electric fleet.
  The Keystone Pipeline was a done deal Contracts signed, Biden tossed them in the garbage and really pissed off Canada.
  This all adds up to a VERY good chance that the Contract will be recinded and WKHS will end up with at least a large piece of it.  This is outside of  the WKHS suit."
2021-06-16 13:43:25,wallstreetbets,At no point have I said this would default to WKHS. But they have a shot. I think the contract was fraudulently awarded. At the very least insider trading.
2021-06-16 18:26:30,wallstreetbets,You again????Give it up!!!! You are a damn short.
2021-06-16 18:38:36,wallstreetbets,SHORT ALERT!!!!!!!
2021-06-16 12:36:42,wallstreetbets,The only source I can find is one of those short research firms who put shit out to tank a stock: https://fuzzypandaresearch.com/workhorse-group-critical-failures-revealed/
2021-06-16 15:13:52,wallstreetbets,"Yep. And it's relevant, but proves nothing. We saw senators get away with insider trading just recently that was much more clear cut than ""someone bought shares."" The presence of insider trading doesn't invalidate the bid award process. 

I bought shares of Oshkosh a week before the announcement. Does that make me a insider? They have a LOT to prove."
2021-06-16 15:56:49,wallstreetbets,"""The Postal Service receives no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations. It’s run by a board of governors who are nominated by the U.S. president to staggered terms, and who select the postmaster general.""

Executive Orders have no bearing on the USPS because they're an independent org and can do what they want. Biden can't make their board do shit. He can appoint new people to the board, but his order means literally nothing to the USPS.

https://www.utilitydive.com/news/usps-to-continue-purchasing-gas-vehicles-despite-biden-all-electric-pledge/595675/

Secondly, who the fuck is going to install the infrastructure? The USPS can't rely on ""maybe someone will install charging stations"". They need to be able to do their jobs. You want all-EV? Get the fucking republicans to stop forcing the USPS to fund its pension in full so they can have funds to not pay the bottom dollar. Otherwise, they're going to take technology they know they can deploy."
2021-06-16 13:49:20,wallstreetbets,Will do
2021-06-16 14:54:37,wallstreetbets,"I am simply providing grounds. You’re statement said it was “frivolous” to be exact. If there was insider trading, I would say this is far from irrelevant. But, first criterium are met where you seemed to believe there wouldn’t even be grounds and it is clear that legally there is an avenue."
2021-06-16 15:53:13,wallstreetbets,"DeJoy can't unilaterally make decisions. That's not how the USPS works. Proving that he illegally railroaded them is IMMENSELY difficult.

Secondly: even if they met the benchmarks, THERE IS NO OBLIGATION FOR THE USPS TO SELECT THEM. None. Zilch. Zero. They can pick whoever the fuck they want and there's not shit WKHS can do about it. 

They could bag DeJoy and lock him up for insider trading and it changes literally nothing about the contract. Workhorse has to prove that DeJoy broke US government contract processes (which I'm not even certain the USPS has to follow the same way that say, the DoD has to), that the decision was fraudulent based on collusion and had no grounding in data or research, AND that the outcome would have been different. 

If the board vote was unanimous, they're still fucked."
2021-06-16 18:37:18,wallstreetbets,.
2021-06-16 18:06:52,wallstreetbets,"Biden can't do shit to the USPS to overrule the decision. Neither Biden nor congress have any power over the USPS under current law. The board of Governors of the USPS control all decisions.

Now, if they clear the board, maybe something happens, but until then there is a zero chance."
2021-06-16 13:51:32,wallstreetbets,"It's entirely possible it was. Proving it would be immensely difficult. The awarding doesn't necessarily get voided even if that's the case.

Insider trading just fucks DeJoy. Doesn't do shit else for WKHS or the contract.

For the record: Fuck DeJoy and I hope he does get screwed."
2021-06-16 14:57:49,wallstreetbets,This was announced after they got the boot from the top 5. They partnered with someoene else who didn't to get back into the top 3. Workhorse had issues with their platform.
2021-06-16 15:43:11,wallstreetbets,"You should probably get some help. Just so you are aware, your reaction to my post is not normal."
2021-06-16 13:53:25,wallstreetbets,"If you do, I'll be pleasantly surprised. I've seen quite a few of these cases over the years and never seen one be successful. I'd welcome finding out what, specifically, makes one of these successful."
2021-06-16 15:00:34,wallstreetbets,"They can't just claim insider trading and have that count as grounds. There is no proof (currently available) of any insider trading, just a claim someone bought a lot of shares. They have to have EVIDENCE for it to stick and get taken to court. Otherwise, it'll get dismissed like anything else done for a news bite.  And, even if there was insider trading: that has literally nothing to do with the bid awarding process unless they can prove it was both someone who made the decision and that it changed the outcome. They have a huge mountain to climb. 

If they had evidence, they wouldn't have declined to comment. They'd have stated that they have evidence or theur lawyers would have made public statements of how strong their case was."
2021-06-16 18:26:57,wallstreetbets,Short!!!!
2021-06-16 18:55:23,wallstreetbets,"Bullshit, Biden can fire them all in a heartbeat.  First thing I would like to know is who bought $500,000,000 in OSH stock shortly before the contract award was announced?

I worked for City Gov't.  It is VERY common to write the bidding rules to favor the biding Co. you have already decided on.    Many City officials were then rewarded with lavish vacations at no cost to them.  It only gets worse on the County, State, and Federal levels.

Biden declared that 75% of all Fed vehicles would be electric, either he is a fucking liar, or he has to award the contract to an electric vehicle manufacturer."
2021-06-16 13:55:58,wallstreetbets,"You are absolutely right, but yesterday, no chance, today some chance.  

 I fully agree they have not yet demonstrated mass production but they are making significant quarterly gains in production. I also secretly hope that when RIDE goes belly up, that WKHS takes their manufacturing capacity, in whatever state that is in.  

If the company was perfect, I wouldn't be able to buy shares this cheap, there are certainly risks and I don't place all of their success on one contract."
2021-06-16 15:11:03,wallstreetbets,Show me a source that isn't a short research firm. I couldn't find one.
2021-06-16 16:01:26,wallstreetbets,"Reacting by discussing it is not normal? Okay.

What world do you live in, kid?"
2021-06-16 15:04:54,wallstreetbets,This is a multi billion dollar contract. I doubt they would attempt to challenge without a plan of recourse. It is also not favorable for them to immediately comment on why they would be challenging the contract. It could easily go against their case.
2021-06-16 19:30:21,wallstreetbets,"He actually can't fire them all in a heartbeat. 

For someone in city government, you seem to be very ignorant of how government works. Either that or you just admitted to taking bribes. One or the other.

""To oversee USPS’s activities, Congress established a nine-member board of governors who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. No more than five members of the board may belong to the same political party. Once confirmed to the board, governors can only be removed by the president “for cause”; that means their jobs are safe unless the president can show that they engaged in malfeasance or extreme neglect of duty"""
2021-06-16 13:57:55,wallstreetbets,"This entire year they've made less than 50 trucks. That's not significant.

2021-06-16 17:50:51,wallstreetbets,"It is VERY easy to get out of the Contract.  Look how easy Biden got out of the Keystone Pipeline Contract and it was being built.  There is a HUGE push in D.C.  to make the USPS fleet electric.  Yes, WKHS is not making trucks fast enough, but they are making Electric delivery vehicles and OHS does not even have one on the drawing board."
2021-06-16 15:47:12,wallstreetbets,"You are correct that the short research firm Fuzzy Panda was the ones who brought this up in 2018, but it is a known fact that Workhorse were out of the running in 2016 and basically bought themselves back in with a partnership with VT Hackney

2021-06-16 19:32:28,wallstreetbets,"Understood. I read something interesting. Spacex and Blue Origin had a similar contract fight, and to settle it they ended up awarding a smaller contract to the loser. Were such a thing to happen in this case it would probably be very beneficial to have a lower vehicle commitment for WKHS."
2021-06-16 19:40:53,wallstreetbets,"That might be ultimately what ends up happening, if anything. They give Workhorse 10% or something with a set delivery date that if they miss goes to Oshkosh.

2021-06-16 15:58:01,wallstreetbets,"Not within the second of. Just capitalizing it doesn't make something true. I got my first award 6 minutes after posting - [which I've screenshotted from my inbox for proof.](https://i.imgur.com/hd1ZKYi.png)

**Which I agree is suspicious.** That's still way too quick. I had comments within that same six minutes already from /u/slowand-old, /u/RamboTheReal, and /u/xmaiisoakao saying they were buying. But two of them explain that they were just watching /New to catch stuff like this and the other posts stuff on almost every DD as soon as it's posted - so he's probably doing the same.

Most likely, people are browsing new to see DD, get in of the ticker ASAP, and award the post to try and fuel a pump on their new ""investment."" Post some half-decent DD on a stock with short interest around 1PM tomorrow and I guarantee you can see the same thing - along with a bunch of people calling it a conspiracy"

2021-06-16 12:56:30,wallstreetbets,6/18 13c bought at 0.09 and sold at 0.5. My comment was posted after I bought them and before the pump really started. double check your time stamps

2021-06-16 14:35:50,wallstreetbets,"There’s no doubt he wanted to draw attention to an idea he had. And maybe he did make some money but it ended so fast I’m not sure about that. But I actually don’t think he was trying to orchestrate a pump and dump, he was trying to start a new meme. I also think he’s right about the algos and people like me who were looking to get in early and profit off the IV spike. It would have worked yesterday on the Gordon Ramsay DD but today it happened even faster."

2021-06-16 14:42:31,wallstreetbets,"He's probably teed up right at the computer ready to go as soon as he posts the DD he catches the spike as soon as it happens.

Have you noticed how many of these DDs follow the same pattern and have the same results? Quick pump and then it goes nowhere. Multiple times and everyone who buys in late gets fucked, like you.

If you think you're quick enough sure make the gamble but everyone else is getting played by shitty DDs and they're going to lose money 

This is the shit thats gunna bring the SEC down on WSB and retail traders and fuck things for everyone"

2021-06-16 13:03:08,wallstreetbets,Here's the trick. Sort by new. Find a DD that mentions a squeeze that is less than 5 minutes old and has awards. Buy lotto calls if it hasn't pumped yet. Sell on any pump
2021-06-16 13:00:44,wallstreetbets,"Lmao bro. i didn't actually go all in. Secondly, if you noticed by now, some WSB DDs have been causing instant pumps on tickers. Just sort by new and look for one that is a few minutes old that already has awards and buy some FDs.

EDIT: also, I am a degenerate gambler"
2021-06-16 14:59:43,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I noticed the pattern, that’s why I thought I’d try to play it today.

2021-06-16 18:37:43,wallstreetbets,"ok ok.... let me reply to this.Background: Brazilian investor and resident, long on Itau unibanco since 2018 and client of its higher end banking services ""itau personalité""

1. its unibanco as in unibank
2. buffet invested 500 million into the startup nubank which is a itau competitor and prolly the best 100% digital banking solution (pure banking) that I have seen (also their client, its common for brazilians to have multiple bank accounts ex: my dad had 4). That being said, I don't think itau should be afraid of nubank as we are still a heavily cash based economy despite the govt trying to change that.
3. itau is prolly the biggest fintech out there. Yes its a traditional bank but they are stepping up their transformation and their big sell besides that is information security.
4. you will prolly see some positive effects as the real gains strength relative to the dollar which might help you out.
5. itau has witheld large ammounts of cash because of corona and might be doling out a large dividend in the near future as the economy strengthens up.
6. its prolly the most solid bank out of all the larg banks out there. its is minimally leveraged and acts fiscally conservative while technologically outgoing.
7. Betting on the brazilian economy long term is a risky move.
8. itau might be hit hard with problems with its chilean branch ""itau corpbanca"" if the socialists create a shit business environment there after their new constitution is concluded.
9. its argentine branch got f\*\*\*\*
10. inflation is on its way and the central bank is raising rates which means its profits will rise as it has on the past.
11. before the pandemic it had an amazing history of divident payments and would pay 18 times in one year.
12. it is far more than a bank. Itau is diversified in many sectors and if you like that you can buy the holding that controls most of it ""itausa"" which is also getting into natural gas pipelines and distribution, the most popular sandal here made by ""alpargatas"" and sanitation (water and sewage). Itau is also vested in the best inssurance company here ""porto seguro"" the biggest brokerage ""xp"" and it is vested in a bunch of other quality assets. Itau works in every banking segment there is including inssurance and their financial solutions span across borders, following there customers into other countries (there are a tonne of brazilians in the US and portugal and so is Itau). Itausa would be the closest thing to berkshire hathaway over here.  


edit: if you want to see more financial data on the bank itself,check out this site. Keep in mind that it is for brazilian stocks and itau preferred stock here is called ITUB4 :

""It's currently downtrending but within expected trends. Historically, it usually bounces back up once meeting the 20-day moving average. I expect it to continue to drop to ~37 which is the current 20-day moving average and then bounce back up to ~45 afterwards. Definitely could hit $60 within the next 2-3 months at this rate. For now, I plan on and am happy to buy more calls as it dips down to the 20-day average""

2021-06-16 17:20:35,wallstreetbets,I think the issue is more of an overall lack of retail interest than concerns about prospects for the gun business. Over 90% of the shares are held by institutions so smart money is just trading amongst themselves. No reason to go all in with large buy orders if they can just accumulate shares slowly in a narrow price range.

Today, Bloomberg reported: “WORKHORSE TO FILE LEGAL CHALLENGE TO U.S. POSTAL SERVICE DECISION TO AWARD DELIVERY VEHICLE CONTRACT TO OSHKOSH”

I wonder how many US senators have stock in Oshkosh lol? I worked for the federal government for years and we constantly got shit equipment from weird companies like Implant Sciences that various politicians had a stake in smh"

2021-06-16 12:30:55,wallstreetbets,"I already YOLO'd into RIDE. We are about to pop, and the news and the rumors just keep getting better. Just my personal opinion because I love the sexy truck!"
2021-06-16 12:22:01,wallstreetbets,Bro that and the 50%ish SI on wkhs makes this look like a trip to the moon
2021-06-16 12:13:16,wallstreetbets,"I bought $WKHS in the last week.  There is a lot of potential good news and the $RIDE relationship is huge.   If/when $WKHS can get a piece (or all) of that USPS contract, esp with DeJoy getting kicked out and several in Congress on $WKHS's/$RIDE's side, then $RIDE will use their skateboard and build those USPS vehicles."
2021-06-16 13:35:17,wallstreetbets,I like WKHS & RIDE.... But let's be honest... Building a postal vehicle based on the well-established Ford Transit (Oshkosh design) just makes long-term economical sense.
2021-06-16 12:15:29,wallstreetbets,"Words of wisdom from Henrik Fisker, another fellow trying to build EV's and not doing a great job with it.

***""...when you feel like you’re 90 percent there, you’re almost there, until you realize the last 10 percent is much more difficult than the first 90""***"
2021-06-16 16:24:16,wallstreetbets,"Again, their only potential deal, is tiny.  30 million dollars a year in profits from that deal.  They burned 100 million + every quarter.  So 400 million in annual expenses, 30 million in profits to offset leaving... 370 million in cash burn in the next 12 months.  So with the 200 million they have on hand they are going to have to find funding to stay alive.  That's either dilution or debt.  Both are bad for the stock price.

Before you look at other vehicle manufacturers taking loans, they have year over year profits.  

This has 370 million a year in losses as it's potential as of today.  That's an anchor, not momentum."
2021-06-16 12:07:49,wallstreetbets,Username checks out
2021-06-16 11:59:55,wallstreetbets,RIDE cant even build their own vehicles. Let alone have any excess capacity. Or lines for a totally different vehicle. Not that the contract is going to WKHS anyway .
2021-06-16 12:31:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you might wanna look at what the postal service needs from a vehicle.  Outside urban areas EVs won't work for them with the current range, especially the range that workhorse is  able to produce.  

This is just a hail Mary to buy them time to try to find customers for their product, and I'm not seeing anyone lining up for their products."
2021-06-16 12:26:06,wallstreetbets,How can you challenge the goverment? Has any company succeed in the past?

2021-06-16 12:35:27,wallstreetbets,At their cash burn rate they will be broke before there is even a court date.  Legal battles like this take years.  Oshkosh has a solid history of delivering on government contracts.

2021-06-16 12:39:41,wallstreetbets,"If by several you mean a congressman from Ohio that's connected to the company.  RIDE is in serious trouble so no benefit there.

2021-06-16 17:37:16,wallstreetbets,AWS did the same thing when Microsoft won a massive government contract about 18 months ago or so. AWS claimed that Trump forced the award to go to Microsoft due to Trump's disdain for Bezos and the Washington Post. Not sure anything has come from it yet.
2021-06-16 18:44:04,wallstreetbets,"not only that, they have to beat a company that has actually delivered before. where workhorse has never done that a single time. not to mention, money was already spent. and workhorse has no plan seemingly how all these rural trucks will even get powered."

2021-06-16 16:22:22,wallstreetbets,No doubt. I’m sure they will lose the case because all USPS has to do is say there was too much risk Work Horse couldn’t deliver what they needed
2021-06-16 15:39:28,wallstreetbets,5% isn't a huge stake.  GM already said if it goes bust they aren't worried.

2021-06-16 15:43:01,wallstreetbets,"Yep but the majority of the geographic US is not, and the post office has to service these areas.  Rural routes and small towns are a massive part of the postal service fleet.  EVs are not currently practical for these areas."
2021-06-16 16:27:19,wallstreetbets,"Workhorse has no way to deliver a vehicle needed for the rural routes that make up the majority of USPS vehicle use.

2021-06-16 15:50:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I agree, but we don't need a 100% ICE fleet just because a small portion of the US mail gets delivered out in the country, and I don't think Oshkosh is that well positioned to make an EV truck/van (which have a 200+ mile range btw).  OTOH, WKHS can provide EV trucks and then buy a few ICE vans for the remote areas."
2021-06-16 16:33:01,wallstreetbets,I’m doubling down on long positions for wish because it has potential if they can get their shit together.
2021-06-16 16:29:39,wallstreetbets,Yeah it being in a shitty position makes it a good time to invest if you believe at least though. I made tons of money on crocs by buying in towards the beginning of 2017 and just holding for a few years and selling when they released their numbers this year. It’s a gamble. Let’s keep it real lol GME would have never been worth it if it was a perfect company without any struggles.
2021-06-16 17:41:12,wallstreetbets,"I don't give a damn if a major corporation loses out on a bad investment, they can afford it.

2021-06-16 13:35:27,wallstreetbets,Go look into pride group.  This looks like a joke of a company that will in no way be able to afford to purchase that many vehicles.
2021-06-16 16:09:43,wallstreetbets,"Workhorse trucks have a 100 mile range according to their site and that's not loaded down, with AC going.  

Rural and small towns account for the Majority of USPS vehicles, they just aren't loaded as full or as large as the urban routes.

It's not a direct volume of mail to vehicle ratio.  However the postal service is required to serve the entire country.

Oshkosh can deliver an EV, and more importantly their design was modular making it able to be retrofitted in the future to full electric if the infrastructure supports it in the future."

B. It's down 45% for the past 6 months. Year to date down 48%

C. Short repots can be bullshit, but they also expose fraud.

This company did mislead investors with bullshit pre order numbers they paid marketing companies to inflate, they admitted this.  Better to drop now than let it get run up higher and higher and when they don't deliver crater even further."
2021-06-16 14:27:24,wallstreetbets,Until they put the cash on the table it's yet to be seen.  A non binding interest isn't poof that they will even buy a single one.
2021-06-16 14:28:42,wallstreetbets,For all we know the pride group guys own a pile of shares and are looking to make a buck.   The alleged interest in purchase was six months ago without another peep or single unit being delivered.

2021-06-16 18:44:51,wallstreetbets,"Of course it does, just cause you can’t afford something doesn’t mean the thing doesn’t have a demand. Demand doesn’t start at transaction."
2021-06-16 15:04:09,wallstreetbets,"This isn't potential even if they deliver the 6000 vehicles over the 5 year timeline it's not enough to cover their cash burn for a single quarter.  Even if their profit per vehicle is 50000 each, which is astronomical and completely unrealistic they would not cover their cash burn from the last quarter."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tesla Ultimate DD Alright degenerates, how many times have your FDs expired worthless and left you recording your wife getting blown out for the weekend by her favorite day trader bf. Cause personally it's been far too many times for me and that's why I have developed a plan to finally make enough tendies to retire off of.

Fuck squeezes I've had it with those DDs and honestly, I don't think buying a stock bc another idiot dumber than you told you about the new Tesla he bought with AMC tendies is a good investment thesis. Instead, I want to invest in something real, something that has a backbone in the actual world that isn't empty movie theaters, and that something is the TESLA your fellow ape just copped.

Back in the day (1 yr ago) when there were only 1 million retards instead of 10, an individual known as u/WSBgod  showered us with his glorious TSLA gain porn.  Today I am going to tell you why and how you can get your own glorious TSLA gain porn and finally fuck your own wife for once.

&#x200B;

DD: The only reason TSLA has the market cap it has today is the potential it has in the autonomous driving market. If TSLA was only priced for cars it sold it wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar company, worth more than every other automaker. This is because TSLA isn't just an automaker and realizing this will be your greatest asset. **High conviction in a stock strengthens the diamond hands holding it!** Anyway, Musk himself believes that when they solve FSD (Full Self Driving) and update all their cars overnight to be able to drive autonomously that TSLA will see the **largest overnight asset increase in history**. IDK about you but that sounds way better than a squeaker screaming ""squeeze"" about the latest stock they saw on somebody's shirt. Elon has reiterated in earnings calls that he is extremely confident they will solve FSD this year and my own knowledge of watching FSD driving videos they have now along with Elon saying the next new update has 100s of improvements and is supposedly coming out this month tells me that autonomy is much closer than most people realize.   

TLDR: FSD --> Stock to the Moon

DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving ever, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA announced and showed on their Battery Day all the manufacturing and engineering improvements they made to producing batteries which reduce the battery cost by almost 2/3rds (66%). They already have a pilot plant of these new battery cells along with new battery production plants being build at their new Gigafactories in Austin and Berlin. Hopefully, by now you can tell the world is transitioning to sustainable energies and EVs are becoming much more prevalent across society. All the EVs made by other car companies will require battery packs to make and operate. The only problem is these other car companies do not have the battery technology that TSLA has. Currently, TSLA is unable to produce cars like the SEMI due to a lack of batteries as they wish to prioritize vehicles with a smaller battery pack like the 3 and Y. Once they get all their battery plants online they will produce more cars than they ever have, along with SEMIS and CYBERTRUCKS. Other car manufacturers will run into the problem TSLA is in right now. They will not have the batteries to produce all the vehicles they want to make and if they try buying excess amounts of batteries that are 200% more expensive than the batteries TSLA is using they will not be able to keep up in margins/ pricing. ( This is why the high-end F-150 Lighting is more expensive than the high-end Cybertruck)

TLDR: Batteries --> Stock to the Moon

DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving and they blow up all their own battery facilities, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA has all the top engineers in the world working for them (this is an underrated aspect of the company in my opinion) and they employ these engineers to do whatever they need to be done. One important team working for TSLA right now is the AI team. TSLA is currently in the development of **DOJO,** a neural net trainer. I'm not gonna pretend to know everything about this because it is way beyond my realm of understanding but what I do know is that **AI runs on DATA.** The more data you have to train your NN, the smarter your AI is. Currently, TSLA has the largest data lead as their cars have **billions** of miles driven on the road whereas the runner-up of Google's Waymo has a laughable **millions**. When DOJO is available TSLA will be able to train its NN with all its data which will result in the best autonomous driving technology available. Beyond training FSD, Dojo can be used to train any NN that Tesla or other companies will have uses for. Dojo is one of the most valuable assets for AI that will exist and that should be valued extremely high in my opinion as I believe AI will be the next largest breakout in society.

TLDR: AI & DOJO --> Stock to the Moon

&#x200B;

The crazy thing about this DD is that I still haven't covered many of Tesla's massive opportunities such as its entire energy business or the future MODEL 2 that will eventually come out. Note that the MODEL 2 is a 25k Tesla which after factoring in the cost savings and any EV incentives that may come out will be the most affordable and best EV for its price and utility. (will hopefully be autonomous as well)  I think basically anyone with a brain will buy the MODEL 2 and it'll kinda be like Apple unveiling the iPhone. Basically, everyone uses an iPhone for their phone now and I think once an EV like the Model 2 comes out everyone will be whipping a Tesla for their car. 

More points if somehow you still aren't convinced

\- Giga factories almost complete in Berlin ( one more month) and Austin (by end of year) this will result in crazy amounts of cars being made and more importantly CYBERTRUCKS

\- Gigapresses at these factories will manufacture cars faster than anything that has been done before. This translates into the CYBERTRUCK ramp being extremely fast.

\-Tesla sells every car they make and yet many terrible news sources say TSLA has demands problems. Elon himself has stated demand is the least of their worries.

\-SEMIS are being slept on, they will start coming out by the end of this year and probably take over the trucking industry the next year. Autonomous truck convoys are the future as they are so much more cost-effective.

\-Overall TSLA is trying to save the world and make it a better place by transitioning to sustainable energy and solving crazy intense real-world problems like FSD which will reduce the driving death count drastically. If you disagree with this please comment cause I would like to understand your perspective on how I am wrong.

\- WSB says they like meme stocks so much well what other CEO is constantly posting memes on Twitter?

&#x200B;

If you actually read all this and still think TSLA is overvalued please reply why after buying puts or if you really are a man sell some naked calls.

POSITIONS: TSLA 1/21/2023 1500, 1600, 1700 strikes

note that u gotta buy leaps, not weeklies cause ELON loves to lie about the timing of things. Although they might be late, they always come you just gotta diamond hands till then. The man literally made rockets land I think he can make cars drive."
2021-06-16 11:57:26,wallstreetbets,"So I've been OTL on Tesla a bit, but a Model 2 is in the works? So the lineup went from S3XY to 2S3XY?

Bullish. I'm in."
2021-06-16 13:09:59,wallstreetbets,"Tesla DD. If Elon says something that sounds cool, price goes up.  

If Elon says something stupid, price dips then goes back up

If Elon says something groundbreaking is coming out, it probably will take 3 times longer then he says, but price goes up.

If Elon says something completely rational and measured.  People will panic, think the world is ending, and price will drop."

2021-06-16 12:16:07,wallstreetbets,"FSD is both already priced in and over optimistic in two fronts. The first is that Tesla will not get FSD this year according to [their own engineers](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/tesla-dmv-memo-self-driving). End of 2022 is still optimistic. The second is that it will take years before autonomous driving is allowed by laws, or accepted by the general public.

The revenue generation from the AI is unproven, and on top of that is only really relevant to FSD. See above.

I agree about the batteries. I would also add it's more than just batteries, as they have produced systems using those batteries that are practical and useful - powerwall for home energy storage coupled with solar, the Australian grid backup solution, the supercharger network."

**From the degenerate behind** [**The $WOOF of Wall Street**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzq2ke/the_woof_of_wall_street_a_shart_play_dd/) and [**$TX - Latin America's Balls of Steel**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx74mo/tx_dd_ternium_it_up_latin_americas_balls_of_steel/)**, I introduce to you $LESL -  A S.H.A.R.T DD.**

# The Poolpercycle:

To give context behind why I decided to look into Leslies Swimming Pool Supplies, I will first educate you retards on the ongoing Poolpercyle (pool supercycle). Housing prices are at all time highs, lumber prices skyrocketed, and every commodity is rising in price faster than your dicks on Viagra. JPOW continues to suppress inflation as the money printer goes brrrr, with my suspicions being that him and Yellen are making love to the sounds of the money printer going brrrrrr (jk).

**Chlorine** is a prime commodity that has undergone severe shortages recently and **Leslie Swimming Pool Supplies** is about to take full advantage of every penny faster than Krabs can say “money money money”. As reopening continues in the United States, many Americans are still at home and in a rush to build pools in their backyards to avoid the local summer crowds. New homeowners who had to deal with inflated housing prices are seeking to get pools built on their own, rather than purchasing a house that already has one. Past the one-time expense of getting a pool built, most companies such as Leslie capitalize on the everlasting **maintenance and servicing** needed to ensure your kid’s pool piss is cleaned in time. Currently, there are approximately 5.2 million residential inground pools and 255,000 commercial pools across the United States. Of these, approximately 65% necessitate the use of **chlorine tablets**. These tablets are used in the filtration and sterilization process to ensure each pool is void of disease and bodily fluids that your 5 year old cousin dumps into the ecosystem.

Within 2020 and through 2021, **there are an estimated additional 200,000 new residential pools being installed.** Additionally, the sale of permits required to operate certain pools has risen by 32%, nearly **85% more than the previous year.**

Coincidentally, and to the advantage of this DD, the Bio-Lab factory, which produces pool and spa treatment products, experienced a devastating fire last summer after Hurricane Laura. **To this date, the nation is experiencing a chlorine shortage as a result of this fire.**

As given by chlorine analysts, *“IHS Markit predicts chlorine prices could jump 70% this following summer, after already doubling in some areas in the months following the fire at BioLab. The real effects of that fire haven’t been felt, as it took place right before Labor Day, when many pools close for the end of summer.”* What this shows me is that there is still a large upside and that the worst of the shortage’s impact on pool prices is yet to come.

**My research has led to one conclusion. What we are seeing is an unprecedented intersection between rising commodity prices, shortages, and high pent up demand for summer pool builds. The time has never been more perfect to invest in companies dealing with the Pool Boom aka Poolpercycle.**

&#x200B;

# So who is Leslie and why the fuck is she selling pool supplies?

Leslie’s Swimming Pool Supplies is the largest direct-to-consumer brand in the U.S. pool and spa industry. Operating since 1963, at the dawn of the age of suburban pools, Leslie has nearly 940 physical locations and an expansive e-commerce platform that rivals most local brands. They specialize in residential pools and spas, as well as commercial pools and even custom builds. The company sells maintenance items, such as chemicals, equipment and parts, and cleaning and maintenance equipment, as well as safety, recreational, and fitness-related products. Their diverse array of expertise caters to clients of all needs and wants, proving their business model to be quite adaptive. 80% of their sales are non-discretionary, which in autist terms means necessary/essential purchases. **By solidifying a model that is almost completely based on necessary purchases, Leslie stands to profit from the Pool Boom for years to come. Finally you can profit off of the Chad poolboy banging your wife.**

Leslie's also benefits year round as pools need to be maintained (even in the winter). Failure to do so results in imminent degradation of the pool’s foundation and ultimately risks collapse or inground flooding. Additionally, without maintaining a clean filtration and treatment system, the overall pool system could be damaged and need further replacement, incurring unnecessary costs. As a result, most residential and commercial customers prefer to buy those sweet, sweet essential chlorine products from Leslie's.

# Piss In The Pool:

[\\""Look Ma. I'm Peeing\\"" - proceeds to shart-](https://preview.redd.it/0updw12gdn571.png?width=1322&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe65c57695f9be974d73134c8b5ec33fee123c43)

So how does a company selling overpriced chlorine pellets stand to profit?

2 simple reasons:

* **When little James sharts himself in the pool, you’re not cleaning that up yourself.**
* **Leslie is vertically integrated and produces its own chlorine pellets.**

By being its own manufacturer and reseller, Leslie incurs no additional costs that other pool companies have to pay when buying these pellets wholesale. As of now **45%** **of profits** come  directly from the pellet sales. Their main competitors such as Holiday Pools have been severely impacted by the Louisiana chemical plant fire, and face in-store shortages. **Leslie does face chlorine pellet and product shortages as well, which I highlight in the**  **️‍🌈🐻**  **Case, but I believe that by producing their own products, a shortage at Leslie means a shortage at every other pool store.** There would simply be no other place to shop from save for paying high premiums on overseas products.

Leslie's futher offsets costs to its customers with a “fuck you pay me” approach, similar to what $TX has done with steel. Buying stocks that directly deal with chlorine distribution can be more risky if commodity prices suddenly fall or shortages are resolved. **$LESL gives zero fucks as it will profit regardless while one thing remains constant: demand.**

# With Love & Loyalty, From Leslie:

Leslie may be increasing costs on the consumer end but it recognizes the pool demand boom and continues to expand rewards and education programs to help its customers make better purchases and improve their pools’ quality. **Leslie’s Pool Perks** is a new loyalty program that boosts its e-commerce presence by offering **free shipping on all orders, 5% rewards points on every purchase**, and special discounts through its app including many extended warranties.

With inground pools costing $35,000 and above ground pools near a cost of $3,000, rewards points alone would range from $150 to $2000, all of which would cover future chlorine pellet necessities.

Leslie has also started a joint educational program this summer with the YMCA  to teach safe pool maintenance and usage practices, as well as the risks associated with inground pool play ;).  That’ll teach your wife to not fuck her boyfriend in the water.

**Based on this information, I believe that the investments Leslie is continuously making in its customer base show it is dedicated to provide a quality experience while racking up profits in the process.**

# The H.A.R.T Play:

* **Hype:**

$LESL has been mentioned here before, if minimally. There was also a Pool Gang in the past who got shit on due to bad market timing and suppressed price movement. I will discuss this soon. IV is moderately high ranging from 50% to 80% as of writing this which tells me this is still a good options play if you believe that Leslie is a good buy.

* **Availability:**

As mentioned in past DDs, when I say availability, it is meant to measure the demand of the goods and services provided by said company. Leslie’s products have extreme demand and not enough supply. In the short term this may seem detrimental as customers won’t always get enough supplies, but in the long-run this is extremely profitable. Plus, who else are they going to buy from? Raj from Pool Support?

* **Really Memeable:**

$LESL is quite memable for 2 reasons:

1. For fucks sake, Leslie sounds like Becky’s side bitch who takes two shots and falls asleep.
2. $LESL and pools can coin the phrase “Drown the Shorts”

&#x200B;

* **Timing:**

This may be the best entry point in a long time. With the FOMC meeting today and JPOW shenanigans, $LESL may dip further, bringing its price point down to levels not seen **since December**. Additionally, $LESL put/call ratio continues to grow, giving a golden opportunity to catch price action off guard.

# Financials:

[“My bathtub the size of swimming pools” \~ Future ](https://preview.redd.it/ymle9yuldn571.png?width=344&format=png&auto=webp&s=8040f02d502b3fb86a256281b1c4c3fbc1e4a225)

$LESL is smart and went public this past fall, right when chlorine shortages started to impact supply across the nation. **Over the past 57 years, they have had consecutive sales growth at 7.1% CAGR since 2001.**

For Q1 of 2021, Leslies was expected to have a -$0.1 EPS, but ended with a -$0.02 EPS, indicating a **80% beat.** For Q2 of 2021, the expected EPS is **$0.53, or nearly a 2600% increase over one quarter.** Additionally, just yesterday, Leslie released forward guidance indicating an expected EPS of **$0.75** **which would indicate 3750% EPS growth.**

Leslie’s physical footprint through retail now exceeds **all 20 of its competitors combined**. This is essential to sustained growth because when looking at P/E growth as well, it is clear competitors may be overpriced relative to $LESL. Pool Corporation has a P/E ratio of **40**.**75** and serves as one of the largest competitors to Leslie’s due to its vast network of clients. If we calculate Leslie’s P/E ratio based on the expected EPS of $0.75, the predicted P/E is approximately 36. **However, the stock price does not reflect this value correctly.**

Leslie’s adjusted EBITDA of $9.5 million compared to $(8.1) million in the prior-year quarter showed an improvement of $17.6 million. They also raised their fiscal 2021 sales outlook by $75 million, Adjusted EBITDA by $25 million, and Adjusted net income per share by $0.10.

**Gross profit increased 79.6% to $71.7 million** from $39.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 and gross margin was 37.2% compared to 31.6% in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 567 basis points.

**Following the news of forward guidance that beat analyst estimates by 50%, $LESL dropped 1% and an overall 13% this month, as the massive red dildos annihilated calls. Considering the immense growth $LESL has gained over the past quarter, it’s stock price should be around $32-$35 at fair value.**

# Price Action

**Here’s where things get interesting with the price action:**

The price point of $LESL continued to grow upwards as shortages began to impact consumer goods early 2021. However, despite increased earnings, higher EBITDA and large scale customer improvements, **$LESL IS AT THE SAME PRICE AS IT WAS IN DECEMBER.**

HOW is it that a company that has a **3600% higher** predicted EPS over the past 6 months due to increasing chlorine prices, is STILL AT THE SAME SHARE PRICE AS IT WAS IN DECEMBER. The day earnings come out, $LESL will blow away everyone with its balance sheet and numbers.

# Analyst ANALysis:

The consensus between 10 different analysts is that **on average, $LESL has a price target of $34.** On the upper end it is predicted to be **$41** and on the lower end $28. Given the nature of analyst targets, even if the minimum value of $28 is considered, **$LESL is still being suppressed under its fair value.**

**Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley’s** current PT is a minimum of $30 and a maximum of **$38** from my understanding with several firms giving a **Strong Buy** rating. **Although ANALysts can be quite wrong, the general consensus across the industry indicates to me that $LESL is severely undervalued and is one of the best long-term and short-term summer plays in the market.**

# ️‍🌈🐻 Case:

[Blackrock buying up America right now](https://preview.redd.it/k5pvm5yudn571.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3650b9158f78fceeda6359569d4c72e5c3712f0)

The primary bear case for Leslie’s is a sudden drop in demand. As I mentioned earlier, even if chlorine supply chains magically started producing enough for the global market, $LESL would still have thousands of new pool owner customers who will need their product for years to come. If the coronavirus is somehow eradicated within the summer, and public sentiment about public pools grows more positive, this might slow down demand and result in less new pool builds than expected.

Additionally, other competitors may invest into their own chlorine pellet facilities to become vertically integrated, but not only would this require large initial capital investment, but time. By the time such a facility would be made (1-2 years), the Pool Boom could be over.

Finally, there are always disruptors to consider in the overall macroeconomic environment. The current housing boom is driving the Poolpercycle, and rightfully so. However, this could change at any moment. A housing market crash would most likely cause many new homeowners to rethink their pool purchases, and potentially depress the overall market in the short-term. The main reason I do not think this will happen is because in 2008, the factors of subprime loans and irresponsible lending essentially self-fucked the average citizen and banks. In the 2021 market, we are seeing large investment firms like Blackrock, who manage trillions in assets, buy up hundreds of properties across the nation and rent them out to those who can afford it. The risk here is significantly less, and not dependent on any one individual. However, it is important to consider this aspect of the bear case.

# Conclusion:

# Through these findings, I believe that $LESL is a massively undervalued company. Its strong fundamental financials and continued pool supply consumption, leads me to believe that it’s due for a large run up in the next month fueled by other institutions. I see Leslie hitting a PT of at least $32 within the next month or two.

**My position is 100 contracts for 30C July 16th contracts and I will slowly build this up depending on price action throughout the month. I believe that Leslie’s will be fucked up her butt with massive green dildos.**"

2021-06-16 11:44:54,wallstreetbets,Thanks for your help! Mods here are actually great haha
2021-06-16 14:12:00,wallstreetbets,Yea its because OP and his friends front loaded buying calls. OP probably even bought in prior to his friends and is now selling to them lol.
2021-06-16 12:12:16,wallstreetbets,TLDR: Stay away
2021-06-16 11:48:27,wallstreetbets,Mods asked me to repost it without the short squeze junk.
2021-06-16 12:27:32,wallstreetbets,Yep. trust no post that has that many trophies immediately after being posted and replies get massively downvoted if negative
2021-06-16 15:28:22,wallstreetbets,Seriously how this is not obvious as absolute fuck to everyone is beyond me. Sucker is born every day. Ethically I don’t give a shit about the companies I’m investing in but OP is a piece of shit for sure if this is the case.

2021-06-16 11:45:14,wallstreetbets,Bruh idek. I removed all short interest stuff and made it clean this time.
2021-06-16 13:19:39,wallstreetbets,"I won’t be posting anymore anyways. People don’t appreciate it, algorithms spike and crash it, and it’s just not worth the amount of the time and effort I put in to do this research lol"
2021-06-16 11:49:45,wallstreetbets,Not trying to do that. Mods said I could repost without the junk short squeeE stuff
2021-06-16 12:33:28,wallstreetbets,"No idiot, it’s a result of this stupid pump and dump post."
2021-06-16 11:46:03,wallstreetbets,"It’s okay, I removed all the short interest stuff and mods approved it. I’m still holding my July’s wether it’s at a loss or profit. Plus I have no control over the stock😂"
2021-06-16 11:58:37,wallstreetbets,I don’t P&D anything. Algos might be doing that but that’s literlaly not my fault. I spend hours writing this stuff up lol and follow a timeline
2021-06-16 12:03:08,wallstreetbets,Yup DD on WOOF then dumped lol.
2021-06-16 12:53:32,wallstreetbets,I just asked someone about this and they said you're stupid as hell lol

2021-06-16 11:52:24,wallstreetbets,Most of them.  A couple are real arseholes.
2021-06-16 15:24:13,wallstreetbets,*looks at chart* hmmm one massive spike all the way to $28 then falls directly back down perfectly coinciding with the timing of this post. Yeah not suspicious in the slightest. This sub is prime pickings for this kind of bullshit. They’re just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks.

2021-06-16 12:17:11,wallstreetbets,I can’t answer too much but I find it really stupid that algos just pick up on a stock and immediately crash it. It ruins the entire play. Market Makers definitely need to incorporate some kind of sentiment tracker otherwise memes will never disappear and volatility will be too high in overall market
2021-06-16 13:25:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah agreed, Mistake on my part"
2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Shills or no, wish is a solid bet Will it moon to $50+, no probably not.

Is it undervalued right now?  Absolutely

1. It has been investing in logistics to offer quicker delivery, demonstrated by a 275% YoY increase in logistics revenue. Since these revenues provide low margins, its overall gross margins have decreased in accordance. However, once it achieves economies of scale in the segment, margin growth should reverse and trail back towards 70%.
2. U .S. merchants increased by over 400% YoY, and a similar trend is to be seen in other countries. Moreover, it is growing Wish Local, a service connecting local businesses to the platform, accounting for 7% of all Wish orders. Wish local is growing its footstep internationally and thus increasingly mixes with other products on the website.
3. It believes marketing expenses can decrease to 40-45%, leading to EBITDA margins of 25% at the midpoint range. If it achieves these ambitious goals (which is very well possible), its profitability margins would be similar to those of eBay or MercadoLibre

Boasting over 100 million monthly users on its platform and connecting thousands of merchants from all over the world. The mobile shopping app continues to be one of the top downloaded shopping apps in the space and has a unique value proposition, which is smarter than it appears at first sight. Its partnership with PrestaShop will give over 300,000 merchants free access to a direct integration that connects them directly to Wish's merchant dashboard, further driving growth.

Again shill or not, this is a bet worth making.

I expect it to reach $20 before the end of July, and back in the $30 range before EOY as the holiday season is going to explode for them."
2021-06-16 12:21:40,wallstreetbets,"This is basically what got me on board this morning. I came to the same exact conclusion. It doesn't even matter if it's being shilled, because 1) It's legit undervalued, even according to analysts; and 2) It's a meme stock now.

It *will* go up."
2021-06-16 11:47:03,wallstreetbets,Consider me on the optimist side but I’m thinking wish is at 30$ by the end of July
2021-06-16 11:42:30,wallstreetbets,Only people crying about shills are people that bought amc at 70. This is not a place where we group together to run up stocks because that's illegal. Invest in what you like and always remember to take profit.
2021-06-16 12:51:55,wallstreetbets,"With wish I always hear PS ratio, PS ratio

But can someone explain why their current PS ratio of around 2, which is the same as Wayfair, isn't realistic?"
2021-06-16 16:39:09,wallstreetbets,June 22 wish can hit 20 and end of july can hit 35 my guess

2021-06-16 12:33:18,wallstreetbets,I'm buying much as i can when its near $10. If WISH breaks $15 it will rocket to $30 easy.
2021-06-16 13:06:28,wallstreetbets,">as the holiday season is going to explode for them.

Lol literally nobody I've ever talked to has said ""Hey, I think I'm going to buy Christmas presents from Wish."""
2021-06-16 11:54:35,wallstreetbets,"Their TTM of losses would say otherwise.  Losing 800 million in twelve months is nothing to be bullish about.  Especially when you go read the reviews of customers experience with Wish.  It sure doesn't sound like anything is improving.  

It's the dollar store of the e-commerce world.  That takes weeks to get to you, and frequently sends the wrong item, counterfeit items, never sends it, constantly offers something for a price that they swap for a higher one if you try to buy it.  

They seem to piss off more people than they please.  Not a fantastic business model."
2021-06-16 12:58:54,wallstreetbets,Its a shit company selling shit products
2021-06-16 11:45:43,wallstreetbets,Wkhs gang!

2021-06-16 11:54:38,wallstreetbets,"And before that it was people who got bb at the top or gme at the top or any other random stock of the week people got at the top.

2021-06-16 11:51:41,wallstreetbets,this stock is the biggest regret of WSB right now. Non stop posts of the same priced in DD with people who bought at the top trying to “gather monkey” together 🥳
2021-06-16 12:34:39,wallstreetbets,7 upvotes from people that obviously didnt click your link. Wish 12.50c 6/18 were indeed #2 on that list two days ago but they're today far below WKHS DKNG PLTR ITUB AMC volume. These $wish comment sections really demonstrate that wish apes are probably the dumbest of all apes. Kinda makes me even more bullish. Position : 2400 shares @ 11.72 average
2021-06-16 14:25:26,wallstreetbets,Actually for valentines they are great. But you gotta order it three months before. Cheap one use lingerie. Spent 40$ and my wife had a blast with all of the outfits. But you can’t exactly buy that shit for all of the family.
2021-06-16 14:21:10,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think that any of these people have dealt with wish. I have ordered about eight things. Three items took three months to get here, two never got here and of the six four were cheap shit. Plus their return policy is nonexistent. I brought this up in a previous comment when wish was starting to get popular. I too was downvoted. If it was a penny stock have at it. But at 11$ you gotta throw some serious money to make some money. But we will see. I’m cool sitting this one out."

2021-06-16 12:57:53,wallstreetbets,I'm dumb.
2021-06-16 15:50:52,wallstreetbets,"Ive gotten my money back every time. I even got money back for things that worked fine. Wish isnt scammy, its a legit bussines mostly booming in europe. You gotta have some patince with the app and the things you order, that is what you pay for wich is why the company even exists in the first place. If you want overprized things and fast shipping wish isnt the the place to buy your stuff.

EDIT: funny how people keeps saying wish is selling shit. Wish dosn't sell the shit retard its a platform for other retails or produktions to Sell their shit.... Wish cuts out the middle man. 

half the shit you own is chinese you just bougt it at overprice at wallmart"
2021-06-16 12:18:57,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know about “distraction”, maybe just should have sold earlier? I made profits off clover, but then double dipped and took some losses too 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2021-06-16 12:23:04,wallstreetbets,"Right as AMC was getting serious, along pops up CLOV, WKHS, WISH, and CLNE. And all the news articles like ""Missed out on AMC? Here are other shorted stocks to buy.""

It was a coordinated effort to cause panic selling of AMC and invest in these other pumped up stocks instead. 

I didn't sell AMC to afford buying these others. But many people probably did. It waters down our ability to collectively drive up AMC. 

I made a little profit on CLOV but all the others have turned into long term holds for me because they all dropped within a span of 1-2 days."
2021-06-16 12:28:42,wallstreetbets,"I can see how you and many think that way, I think people just got greedy and jumped on a bunch of new stuff that came along. Pump and dumps have always been here, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen them come and go this fast this often! 

And don’t get me wrong there is LOADS of money to be made if you go all in and all out the same day, play some big ballsy calls and run it up, just don’t get stuck with the bag at the end 😂 

A lot of the people in amc are not selling, that’s for sure!"

# What is $ITUB? ITUB can be whatever you want it to be.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Banco_Ita%C3%BA_logo.svg/1200px-Banco_Ita%C3%BA_logo.svg.png

What $ITUB may be:

- Newest addition to Apple's collection of smart devices. The **SMART BATHTUB**.
- Passion project between CEO Tim Apple & CEO Milton Maluhy Filho.

What $ITUB is:

**$ITUB** provides a range of financial products and services in Brazil and internationally. The company operates through three segments: Retail Banking, Wholesale Banking, and Activities with the Market + Corporation. It offers various deposit products, as well as loans and credit cards; investment banking services; real estate lending services; financing and investment services; and leasing and foreign exchange services. The company also provides property and casualty insurance products covering loss, damage, or liabilities for assets or persons, as well as life insurance products covering death and personal accident; and reinsurance products. It serves retail customers, account and non-account holders, individuals and legal entities, high income clients, microenterprises, and companies. 

# Warren Buffet is BULLISH on BRAZILIAN BANKING. Specifically, on banks holding digital currency, like that which cannot be named.

#TLDR: Not financial advice, make your own decisions, but someone knows something. There is an absolutely insane amount of call options on $ITUB. If there is any amount of abnormal volume on $ITUB this thing's going to blow... like a whale.. because it's a tub... water..

Personally, I will be following the **WHALE MONEY**, positions below.

**POSITIONS:** 100x 7/16/2021 $7C, 20x 7/16/2021 $8C

Monday there were 100k 7c and 8c not 150k. OP doesn't even know how to use ToS since he's double counting an entry.

The 7c and 8c form a call debit spread. Why? Because on Monday in the dark pools was reported 10M share transaction.

Now think about that for one moment. 100k x 100 shares = 10M.

It's pretty clear it's a 10M share short with a 100k lot of call debit spread as protection against a spike in the price."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Invest in Stem The Weekly DD - STEM: The next Tesla?

The new era of clean energy is among us. Clean energy is being backed by governments which means lots of new dollars flowing into the industry. What’s something that not only these companies can do better, but probably everyone in general? How about becoming more efficient? This is what STEM, as a company, is aiming to do.

**What does that even mean?**

STEM’s entire existence is to enable and optimize the energy storage process. Currently, their business model has 3 revenue generating streams:

* Battery sales: STEM purchases batteries from tier-one manufacturers (Tesla, Samsung, etc.), layer on any requested technology additives and resells them.
* Energy management: STEM sells its AI, Athena, as a service. Athena accurately distributes energy effectively, alternating the system between grid power, onsite generation, and battery power for optimal cost reduction.
* Energy sales: STEM sells power from its many storage facilities.

&#x200B;

At the moment the bulk of their revenues does come from battery sales (hardware), however, they CEO of STEM has recently said they are trying to shift away from hardware and more into their energy management software as a service (SaaS - software).

Remember, the way ‘ol WallStreet looks at companies is:

Hardware = Low Margins = BAD

Software = High Margins = GOOD

Not only is STEM making the transition into a higher margin space, they are expanding into a *growing* industry.

&#x200B;

**Renewables are here to stay**

Perhaps the most obvious example governments pouring into clean energy is the $2T 2021 Infrastructure Plan proposed by Joe Biden. One of the key focuses of this plan is a $100B investment on radically upgrading the electrical grid to include more renewable energy (perfect for STEM). Furthermore, this plan reserves another $174B to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric vehicles ([source](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/31/982908847/biden-set-to-unveil-expansive-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan)). This will add additional strain to the current electrical grids and require more robust storage and energy management solutions. Although they are currently only dominating the market in California, they have big plans to expand across the entire domestic U.S, enabling them to capture a vast portion of the market.

Overall, STEM seems to be growing at an incredible rate with a large bank account to fund its rapid growth. Their cash flows are solid (recurring revenue is king) and their profit margins are very attractive. While they are currently losing money due to their high operating expenses, they expect to become profitable from 2023 onwards and are moving very quickly towards that goal.

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Like any industry, there will be some risks. In my opinion, for STEM, their biggest risk is that they are unable to capture the market in new expansions and that their SaaS and energy management service doesn’t take off. Remember, hardware industries with low margins are pretty kicked to the curb by WallStreet. Future earnings reports and expectations should emphasize their growth and transition as a software play, if not it may be reflected by the stock price taking a hit.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

Fundamentally STEM’s balance sheet is strong (completely debt free). Sitting with 525m in cash they’ve got a great opportunity to strengthen their presence outside of California, where they are currently dominating, and expand within the domestic United States. This is somewhat of a new industry, but as EV and renewable energy demand increases with the “clean energy” movement this could potentially be a good investment in a company that is set to rule this space (within the domestic US).

Disclosure: No position in the stock yet, but may purchase in the next 72 hours if we get a dip."

2021-06-16 10:53:58,wallstreetbets,Year old account with no karma. Sure.

Clowns."
2021-06-16 11:17:56,wallstreetbets,"10 comments and 19 awards. Lol anyone looking to wsb for actual DD now is a true idiot 🤡🤡🤡🤡

Wsb has been a great p&d platform for a while, but the speed at which its accelerated in the past month is striking"
2021-06-16 11:25:08,wallstreetbets,Can we just disable rewards on this subreddit? Would help a lot at fighting against pump and dumps from obviously insincere paid accounts.
2021-06-16 11:16:48,wallstreetbets,"There is no NEXT Tesla, the Next Tesla is Tesla"
2021-06-16 11:32:06,wallstreetbets,"Wow.. Look at OP comment history.

A junior in high school a year ago and then we have a dumb college level DD. Plus three other posts stating 'Invest in...'

Bullshit."
2021-06-16 11:43:46,wallstreetbets,I’m surprised with 9 awards that there aren’t  bots saying “FUCK IT IM ALL IN. STEM TO 100 EOW WHO IS WITH ME”
2021-06-16 18:56:32,wallstreetbets,I actually like this stock lol ..*awkwardly looks at comments and hides*
2021-06-16 17:43:40,wallstreetbets,"I'm very long STEM if they can get ahead, I think they should partner with Eose Energy who is another De-SPAC'd company that produces batteries purpose built for grid storage, but due to composition they have better discharge and none of the over heating issues other batteries seem to have.  


Position: None in either company"
2021-06-16 10:40:05,wallstreetbets,I love this investment more than I love cheese and I am from Wisconsin
2021-06-16 14:54:31,wallstreetbets,"Holding my 456 shares. This company is really undervalued with a market cap below $5billion. They are the leaders in this space, even ahead than Tesla. Their secret sauce is the AI engine that the company claims has atleast 10years lead among peers. Easy $100 stock in the future. Also there is a rumor that this company has partnered with Tesla on virtual power plants project in NY"
2021-06-16 12:59:53,wallstreetbets,Been holding this one. Surprised its here. I don't think this one belongs here though.
2021-06-16 10:57:05,wallstreetbets,I have been buying in over the past 4 months. Im glad to see this post. Their business is generating a lot of interest it seems they announce new partnerships or new places where they are introducing their software weekly. Personally I think they are a long term investement  10-20 years even longer and be a great competitor for all the other clean energy solutions out there and if they keep their momentum they are likely going to beat expectations for the next 2-3 years.
2021-06-16 11:53:03,wallstreetbets,One of the most exciting opportunities in the public market atm.
2021-06-16 15:30:19,wallstreetbets,"Even though OPs account history is suspect, I still think STEM is a good buy. However, the price shot up a bit in a past few week. I'm selling puts at a $25 strike. Wouldn't mind at all getting assigned at that price."
2021-06-16 11:55:39,wallstreetbets,The fact that they named it STEM means they are trying to sucker in idiot investors. Buy it on hype only

2021-06-16 12:35:46,wallstreetbets,Excellent job calling this shit out. The top comment on all these posts should be calling out these shills.

2021-06-16 10:55:43,wallstreetbets,watch it blow up too
2021-06-16 10:59:46,wallstreetbets,But if it was one of the stocks you invested in you’d be ok with it being a one year old account.

2021-06-16 19:05:32,wallstreetbets,Dude not every DD post is a hedge fund ploy to distract u idiots from ur dogshit stock

I’d stay here for meme stocks and pump and dumps.

2021-06-16 11:27:27,wallstreetbets,Agree with this. Awards were a cool way to reward good DD but now people are flooding posts with awards to get them in front of everybody.
2021-06-16 11:42:53,wallstreetbets,That is an immediate turn off. Any time someone says “next GME” i feel the exact same way
2021-06-16 10:46:37,wallstreetbets,"Ditto, on both statements"

2021-06-16 13:26:13,wallstreetbets,Hows about you buy some CALLS of $DEEZ
2021-06-16 11:03:49,wallstreetbets,His one and only comment is talking about how his parents wouldn’t let him wrestle or something. You think a child wrote this?
2021-06-16 11:58:01,wallstreetbets,"If you look at the time posted and when IV jacks up on the mentioned ticker, it's within minutes (if not seconds) over the past week. Retail ain't profiting unless you already have a position."
2021-06-16 14:00:05,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, find any market sub that has less than 5k or 10k users and look for DD. The higher the user count, the more often it's going to be scraped for p&d opportunities and FUD. Also, search WSB for *high quality* DD content, look at that user's profile and see where else they post and visit. More often than not, the quality users only come to WSB to post final DD and not initial thoughts and discussions."
2021-06-16 11:53:15,wallstreetbets,Fr fr gme has been the only yolo short squeeze play and still is
2021-06-16 12:07:09,wallstreetbets,So do we think it’s literally a kid or an account that was hacked/purchased?
2021-06-16 17:52:40,wallstreetbets,So I’ve noticed lately. A lot of these weird scammy DD and the hype comment bots are all accounts 4-5 months old with weird karma numbers. Like they all lurked and suddenly out of nowhere posted a very lengthy and seemingly clean (and somewhat convincing) DD.
2021-06-16 12:43:35,wallstreetbets,"Hard to say... would be weird to purchase a year old account with like no history. I have no idea but it's ridiculous how many of these bullshit posts have plagued this sub over the last several months. Anyone coming here naive from a MSM outlet talking about 'reddit' and 'wallstreetbets' is getting shilled to death, instead of treated with amazing retarded SPY weekly YOLOs like they deserve"

All I see is WISH, CLOV, CLNE, etc. It's gross. Obviously GME isn't the only stock but with the market about to collapse and GME primed for the biggest squeeze of our lifetime...... they are hiding it from the 10M users here.

Getting wrecked because of one bad week with contract expiry coming up is a yolo. Buying shares is just investing."
2021-06-16 17:09:44,wallstreetbets,I feel ya man. It really is sad. The worst part about it is the people that are giving into these shitty pump and dumps. Real ones know that GME started everything and it is going to be the one to end it all.

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A Bull's Case for AMC TL;DR at bottom

I’m extremely bullish on AMC. In fact, more than I was back in late January and early February. The inflation rate, collateral issues, and reverse repos are all factors that lead me to believe that investors are inching ever so closer to creating heavy losses for hedge funds and short sellers. As you may be aware, during the AMC shareholder count that occurred on June 2nd, CEO Adam Aaron stated retail investors comprise 80% of AMC shares with each individual averaging about 120 shares each. As of 9am EST this Wednesday morning, AMC has seen 1.76 million trades, and despite no new huge news, it’s already seeing a gradual decrease from yesterday’s close. So why are so many people selling? That’s the thing. I don’t think we are. Earlier this morning, Jim Cramer commented on AMC’s price action in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1405138423741100033):

“Meme people AMC is down…. I think it’s time to burst in.” Now this is entirely speculation on my part, but I believe that this could be serving as a cover for a short ladder attack, which is something that many GME, AMC, and other tickers are familiar with. That being said, I do expect the rest of today and this trading week to be rather ugly. However, no one said that a ride to the moon would be a smooth one. In the past 5 months alone, retail investors have caused billions of dollars worth of losses to hedge funds and overall people that want to screw over working class people. In fact, this past Monday (the 14th), when AMC surged 15%, it caused over $515 million worth of losses. This is chump change compared to some of the other numbers we’ve seen, but they add up. Another interesting piece of information I learned is that recent reports showed that AMC is the most traded stock on Fidelity and Freetrade, and the 3rd most traded stock on Robinhood. Just take look below.

&#x200B;

I personally dislike the Motely Fool, but it allowed me to view information provided by Robinhood. As you can see, sentiment for AMC remains high across multiple brokerages.

&#x200B;

As you can see above, ever since June 2nd, AMC has managed to remain above $42.72 and this has continued for two whole weeks! This has resulted in devastating losses for short sellers. It went as far as touching $70 just two weeks ago. And although it is currently in the mid-50’s range, I believe that bullish sentiment from traders will allow it to continue to climb even in the face of short ladder attacks. According to the data on Webull, AMC has seen more large-scale orders recently. This might be due to the amount of options expiring this Friday, the 18th. Down below, I’ve listed the large-scale buy orders placed and executed in the last 5 trading days:

6/09: $1,829,580

6/10: $4,826,810

6/11: $6,961,840

6/14: $5,458,670

6/15: $9,946,860

Mind you, this is the net value of all large-scale orders that were placed those days. In other words, it took the difference from all the large-scale buys as well as the large-scale sells. The final numbers for all of those dates came out to a positive number, meaning there were more buys than sells. That doesn’t even take into account people buying from RH, Etrade, Fidelity, etc. Needless to say, buying pressure is immense right now, which may the reason there has been an increase of FUD, shills, and bots trying to direct people away from AMC and into other tickers and ultimately tricking them into losing their money into a pump and dump.

In terms of good news, AMC is currently poised to become the dominant movie theatre chain in L.A., which would include two shopping mall locations. With both tourists and locals visiting during the summer, and with more and more Americans receiving the vaccine and the desire to return to normal coming along with it, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see significant increases in revenue as time goes on. This change might not be an immediate one, of course, but it does force investors to consider the long-term plays that come with it.

Short sellers can’t hold forever, but investors can. Short interest will slowly eat away at them and one day, as we all know, they’ll be forced to cover. When this happens, it’ll be every man for himself. Seeing as to how many of us control the stock, though, we could, in theory, just not sell, which would cause an unprecedented rise in stock price. It should be common sense by now that we know that this cannot be accomplished by a single individual, hence the phrase: “Apes together strong.”

TL;DR I feel as though bitch boy Cramer and his ass-kissing gay bear friends are working extra hard to get people to paper-hand. He wants our bananas, but I refuse to give it to him. I think there are plenty of catalysts that not only make the current price sustainable, but on the verge of further increasing. As always, I’m not a financial advisor. Do your own research before making any investment decisions. I just like the stock. AMC to the moon, my friends"
2021-06-16 12:04:58,wallstreetbets,So many of us have been holding since <$15 and didn't sell at 70+. We're obviously not going to panic sell at $54 lol. Get rekt you shady fucks. I can hold forever.

2021-06-16 11:42:39,wallstreetbets,It's down today. It was down last Wednesday too. By Friday it had more than covered its losses and the following Monday even more so. Wednesday is the day to put on *professional* advice earmuffs and buy I guess. I'm long on this. One down Wednesday isn't going to kill momentum for me.

2021-06-16 11:13:08,wallstreetbets,"With share dilutions over the past year the stock is effectively trading at $2-300.

The CEO and executives are gonna make a fortune diluting this company into penny stock irrelevance through issuing billions of new shares over the next 36 months just to pay the bills as their industry becomes irrelevant as home theaters and streaming become cheaper than 2 hours of potential entertainment."
2021-06-16 10:49:58,wallstreetbets,All these other stocks being pumped are shill traps.. its getting really bad
2021-06-16 10:49:27,wallstreetbets,"Bear not good , ape no like , ape must smash .... 💎 ✋"
2021-06-16 16:19:17,wallstreetbets,"A few counter points for you to consider:

1) [https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/) check the weekly domestic box office. Maybe 25% of this ends up as AMC's profit. Compare 2021 with 2019 and keep in mind during 2019 AMC still lost money. Now they've got big debt payments to go along with their normal expenses. 

2) Cost to borrow AMC shares for shorting has dropped dramatically the last couple of weeks. It's under 3% currently. Also many shorters averaged up their cost basis with the recent price run up so there is much less pressure for them to panic close their positions than there was a week or two ago. Never forget it's only profit when you sell and it's only a loss when they buy to cover.

3) The run up in price has been driven by the very high volume, almost double it's average. That same volume which triggers retail to drive up the price also gives short sellers with lower cost basis (e.g. more underwater) easy ways out of their jamb. The sharp movements also allow them to sell puts against their shorts to profit that way.

4) The problem with AMC's expansion plan in LA is the industry just isn't as profitable as it used to be or those ""premier"" theaters with hefty rent payments would not be for sale. They should be using the money they were gifted by retail shareholders to pay down and reorganize their debt, close lower performing screens, and shrink their way back in to a profitable business model."
2021-06-16 10:41:08,wallstreetbets,"My god, you guys are blaming reverse repo on AMC now?  This is next level retard"
2021-06-16 11:34:57,wallstreetbets,Pls elaborate your bull case for amc I would like to know. Company lost 1bln in 2019 and will lose more money this year. Does it really worth 26bln$? Insiders and executives doesn’t believe in the short squeeze and constantly selling and diluting shares. If the squeeze will never happen you will get a 26bln$ company with 3bln$ in debt with no growth prospects. Trade carefully 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-16 11:09:39,wallstreetbets,My main issue with AMC is the nonstop shares issuing and insider selling. They're just trying to profit off their meme status instead of actually making their business better. GME is actually getting new management to transform the company. AMC is using this sub as an ATM. That's why I refuse to buy them.
2021-06-16 12:32:32,wallstreetbets,Ctxr
2021-06-16 10:56:20,wallstreetbets,So many lines to simply say... nothing? Lol
2021-06-16 10:48:37,wallstreetbets,Agree with your analysis
2021-06-16 13:08:44,wallstreetbets,"AMC is on sale today, should I buy more?"
2021-06-16 13:30:55,wallstreetbets,"retail investors owning 80% of a company that is not doing well on their financial statement is not bull case, buying shares at $50+ on a company that cant offer shares to cover its debt is not a bull case, betting on a feeling of a possible shortsqueeze at these prices is not a bull case.. i dont see a bull case dude.."
2021-06-16 11:46:04,wallstreetbets,"Buying more, holding more.

Good to see some sense here."
2021-06-16 16:36:44,wallstreetbets,Good DD.. Its always a good thing to see good AMC stuff on wsb.. Im all in AMC and fully tapped out now.. been in it since january.. and plan to be in it as long as it takes for the motherfuckers to cover all their shorts and naked shorts 🦍
2021-06-16 15:46:00,wallstreetbets,Can we just ban the use of short ladder attack in any dd.  You stock is going down because amc is not worth multiple times more than it was before the pandemic.  I sure as hell won't bet against reddit mass delusions but at some point that stock is going back below 20.  Probably before they end of the year.
2021-06-16 12:23:03,wallstreetbets,"Business insider told me to sell before this sub does, tbh I've never seen and or heard of a bigger piercing screech of a buy signal out in the wild like this in my entire life."

As long as we hold, we win, if they manage to break us in half by making the weak apes paper hand, then we lose.  
Apes are the regular old joes who got together to make some money. Let's stick together and hold together.  
For the skittish apes, if a little dip is gonna scare you, go take a look at how many times GME dipped drastically before it rocketed into its triple digits! Rest easy and get ready for lambo, or at least hooker  money."
2021-06-16 12:36:56,wallstreetbets,"Was kind of hoping for more mentions of fundamentals like RoA, free cash flow, P/E, or at least revenue growth."
2021-06-16 15:43:39,wallstreetbets,I added more shares today and going to see my favorite man Ryan Reynolds at the local AMC as well. Gimme that popcorn!
2021-06-16 11:11:54,wallstreetbets,I like AMC.  I have made a few hundo shorting it.
2021-06-16 11:56:51,wallstreetbets,Sold mine.   Good luck.
2021-06-16 12:05:12,wallstreetbets,I like movies and popcorn 🍿. Bought the dip.
2021-06-16 17:24:31,wallstreetbets,Is it too late to buy AMC now that its so high?
2021-06-16 12:11:34,wallstreetbets,"Why are you talking about the company? The price has nothing to do with the company, this is just a game of buying stock, pumping it to greater fools, and dumping it. I hope you find someone to dump it on, on you'll end up selling it to shorters for a few dollars."
2021-06-16 18:48:13,wallstreetbets,"$AMC is worth $0. It will wind up there eventually. They have so much debt, weren't profitable before the pandemic and have so much more competition. People are consuming media differently now than they were before. Block Buster after Block Buster. Price isn't guaranteed to climb forever, especially if buying pressure dwindles, or if shares keep getting diluted."

2021-06-16 17:08:07,wallstreetbets,"You are an idiot. Short sellers didn't lost that money on Monday. Only those that closed. Just like saying people made 15% on Monday - they didn't unless they sold.

&#x200B;

This is a temporary thing. Apes will get bored when it fails to continue to go much much higher. At that time, it will drop back down as Apes move onto the next meme name. Eventually, it will trade at fundamental value and not based on short squeeze theory."

2021-06-16 12:53:03,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah. Amc sells out on apes every chance they get. Their share dilution over the past year is like a bad joke.
2021-06-16 11:43:54,wallstreetbets,Can you really blame the company though? They are doing their best to save the business and if shareholders are willing to help them why not? 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-16 11:48:09,wallstreetbets,"How are they going to issue billions of new shares? That's dillusional they need share holder approval to issue any new shares. Clearly you are out of touch, stupid, or a shill"

2021-06-16 11:39:31,wallstreetbets,Its worth about $2.85 a share on paper. At best.
2021-06-16 11:56:54,wallstreetbets,I’m glad people make money off AMC but their executive team is absolute trash. I can’t buy based solely off that. The ceo trying to take credit for its “success” is absolutely disgusting
2021-06-16 15:46:53,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Would have to have earning to have p/e.

2021-06-16 19:10:51,wallstreetbets,"Not many people have bought this stock based on the fundamentals. We bought because of the high percentage of a margin call and short squeeze. The bases are loaded, just waiting for the SEC to actually do their job."
2021-06-16 19:04:44,wallstreetbets,Unless they get margin called which could very well be coming. Tons of naked shorting.
2021-06-16 11:06:42,wallstreetbets,"As long as they have cash, sure, but it’s slowly being eaten away. Lose enough money and there won’t be anyone willing to lend them anymore. And if there are, those interest rates will be pricy"

2021-06-16 16:30:11,wallstreetbets,"No doubt we'd probably all do the same thing. Got to take the money where you can take it when you're on the ropes.

But the big bonuses for management, etc, was total bullshit. Even if it was ""only"" $50m or whatever."
2021-06-16 12:19:51,wallstreetbets,"How do you pay the bills with dog shit cash flow? Can’t just meme away creditors.

They have 6 billion dollars in debt and the best year ever in their history they cleared about $500M. Their loss of $5B in 2020 alone represented 10 years of optimal profits.

So damn straight they’ll need to issue an ungodly amount of shares to avoid bankruptcy. Not like they can raise ticket prices to $75 to increase margins.

Meanwhile the CEO will take home tens of millions for steering the company out of the bankruptcy filing they were headed to in 2019."

2021-06-16 12:30:32,wallstreetbets,I take profits to then buy the lowest possible to get as more shares as possible. Started with $100 and 8 something shares then sold and put more money to buy 23 shares. Sold last week at $60 and this morning bought 27.842 shares with the profits

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"An investigation: Hindenburg Research (DKNG) FIRST, WATCH THIS VIDEO: [Down with Hindenburg](https://streamable.com/1hrde3)

Hey retards, I’ve decided to take a break from posting memes and offer a rebuttal to the Hindenburg’s recent [fud article they](https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/) wrote about [DKNG.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njaa8g/why_im_large_and_in_charge_for_dick_kings_dkng/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Before I begin, here’s my track [record](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:TheHappyItalianMan).

In this post, I will discuss the following: what is Hidenburg Research, who is their CEO, Nathan dick-fuck Anderson, then I'll breakdown the Hidenburg Fud article about DKNG. Their evaluation of DKNG. The connection between DKNG, SBTech and the illegal sportsbook market. Lastly, why Hidenburg wrote this article. And of course- there’s a tl;dr at the bottom. Let’s fucking go nerds.

**What is Hindenburg Research?**

[bad guys](https://preview.redd.it/wx1bmg7btm571.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=33535dfd0e18c69fcf831e66a805ca19720a0d03)

Hindenburg Research does exactly what a lot of us do here, they construct DD's and release them onto the public hoping that others will join in on their idea and together make a lot of money. As of lately they've been kind of right, ex: Nikola (was trash we all knew it), Kandi (again trash), Lordstrom Motors (debatable), Clover too (but this one was a flop). Anyway, so HR (Hindenburg Research) looks for heavily  invested-retail stocks, with heavy-bull $$$$, they enter these massive short positions and then they construct these intricate DDs called ""investigations"" on why you should short with them, then the next day, the stock will drill, HR will take profits and the stock either flops or goes back to business in a few months. The big difference maker between our DDs and their DDs is they have fucking money to distribute their idea. I think they were right about the previous companies, but they're definitely stretching with DKNG.

**Who is Nathan ""Dick Sucker"" Anderson?**

[Ugly MF](https://preview.redd.it/r9ocr51dtm571.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=76e824801019de73c2cf2ac9738afdb248d24a0f)

Nathan Anderson is an absolute crook.- the CEO of Hindenburg. This guy literally think's he's God's gift, check out his [twitter](https://twitter.com/ClarityToast?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).

EX:

[But when he manipulates the public it's okay?](https://preview.redd.it/g93yqgweum571.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=774051742d3dffb504455e6bcdfa85d26532abf4)

You can check out his [twitter](https://twitter.com/ClarityToast?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for your own eyes, but this guy is an absolute dick-wad and he really think's he is better than everyone on WSB/retail bros, just because he's had three successful trades, but I think he turned on the wrong stock with DKNG. So we've established that he's a dick head, but what else about him?  He's also been investigated for pump and dump cases before.

&#x200B;

[ Absolute hedgie crook.](https://preview.redd.it/iz7c35dkum571.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=01ad5aae0fdab8693093dd65dfc1707390007e7f)

[Court Filing Link Here](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=qgikmggDYAJeNVM1Gkl1UQ==)

Sounds pretty similar to DKNG, doesn't it? Making up information for their own financial gain. You can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/a38lsw/hindenburg_research_listed_in_pump_and_dump_court/). Essentially, Anderson was releasing fake sources and articles through an alias of a company that was linked to [HR.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SOSLimited/comments/lthtry/i_did_investigation_for_hindenburg_report_issuers/) Promoting their idea and trying to profit off false information.

https://preview.redd.it/921iqljrum571.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29b48c62d7369721e1f78fd6dbfe7de0ebfc561

[He's currently being Investigated by the SEC? - Source](https://www.reddit.com/user/Next_Parfait_1885/comments/nuzu66/nate_anderson_of_hindenburg_being_investigated_by/)

Not sure how accurate this is, but supposedly, he's currently being investigated by the SEC for Misconduct. I guess their website keeps getting taken down by the SEC for investigation. To conclude, Nathan Anderson, is an absolute corporate, pump and dump, shill artist. He doesn't like WSB as you can tell from his tweets and he thinks he's God's gift to drop and article and just instantly make money, regardless of whether it's valid or not. Fuck that Dickhead. This guy, his tweets, his actions should be enough alone to fight against this guy and any company he shorts.

**THE ARTICLE**

The article is absolute trash, if you haven't seen it yet- [here it is](https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/).

There's basically two key arguments. The first, DraftKings is tied to illegal revenue streams (poor sources). Second, DraftKings is overvalued (with some weak fundamentals) So I will be discussing these two arguments and talking about why they're dead ass wrong and/or just plain don't matter.

Before we go in, please watch this CNBC segment from yesterday morning. They explain it very well. TL;DR, SBtech has little to no value for DKNG.  [https://streamable.com/ng95ed](https://streamable.com/ng95ed)

**SBTECH - ""the illegal revenue stream""**

SbTech may or may not have been involved in some shady business altercation back in 2014-2017. You can be the judge of that, but I can assure you that as of the DKNG acquisition, they are most likely clean.

What is [SBTech?](https://www.sbtech.com/)

https://preview.redd.it/tz910a0xum571.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=46213501992f1d2b9a2a4ee67a015eb6a5bc9231

Essentially, SBTech creates the platforms for sportbooks. They are the data analytics. They don't own psychical sportsbooks, rather they create the software for websites to lease out and use for their own branding. HR believe's that SBTech has been leasing their software to illegal sportsbooks in Asian via  a pseudo company, BTI company (kind of ironic right, the man who used pseudo accounts to spew false information- is now accusing another company of using a pseudo name), all because of their locality (their offices are close - they offer a picture of google maps to show this lmao??), they have similar source code (they literally went into google chrome and inspected their website code, you can find similar script comparing source code for ANY website) and their CEO (BTI Company) is friends with the founder of SBTech (people who are in similar business tend to work together). But the factor of the matter is, a quick google search from [Bit Core Tech](http://bitcoretech.com/), and SBTech can tell you that the two companies are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Lastly, they use hypothetical sources, stating that they talked to prior employees of SBTech, saying everything they do is illegal, are you actually going to trust a Hedgie who's manipulated information before, I Know I'm not. Regardless, does it even matter?

https://preview.redd.it/jm9edcs4vm571.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=82be3c18abbe64255db6a857f1f6e83dfaef7caa

[Source](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/39376/sbtech-oregon-sports-betting-contract/)

What's kind of crazy, is that they (SBTech) have an exclusive deal with the state of Oregon, yet HR thinks that their research team is able to do a better investigation than the state of Oregon, and the Department of Justice.  Not only that, the laws associated with establishing a mobile sports gambling license are insane, to think that state and federal investigations weren't able to find any illegal activity is down right laughable.

https://preview.redd.it/ia8rgdv8vm571.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd6e9dee68b3cdbcea1d10bb4b6d2dc97c4f8044

They estimate that roughly half of SBTech's 2020 revenue came from unregulated markets, and about 10% of DKNG's B2B revenue comes from SBTech, so what does that mean? That mean's they're creating fud, this is funny, just wait. Let's say that hypothetically speaking they're right, and DKNG is committing to fraudulent revenue streams, how does this affect their current revenue?

[B2B revenue = $31,429,000 \(SBTech accounts for 10&#37;\) = $3,142,900 total revenue to DKNG](https://preview.redd.it/6hm3rhjbvm571.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=b96263e1539518c0aaa7d08178051e52989815b2)

[$312,376,000 TOTAL revenue so far in 2021](https://preview.redd.it/6rxoj77dvm571.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f063aa6efa69b2270d87c2ee868cabd562c5f35)

Yeah, so worst case scenario, HR is right and DKNG has to remove SbTech from their revenue, damn. Looks like they lost a whopping \~1% of their current revenue stream. Not a massive hit considering they only have access to 25% of the current U.S. Population.

[Bullet point 2 - 25&#37; of U.S. Population](https://preview.redd.it/fzn2q88fvm571.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=2513a920a090df8dc4f21da061fb65b5be5dbbc9)

[June 2020 to Current](https://preview.redd.it/0f7eqh0hvm571.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3b79c9d752d2b090e717dd8faf4073827009937)

Another big point for HR was that insiders were selling. Who the fuck cares- when has insider selling ever been a clear bearish since, news flash , it hasn't. You don't even know what they're doing with that money. They could be investing BACK into the company for all well know. Plus, this back tests back to JUNE of 2020, literally a few months after they dropped the SPAC. Who knows if any of these sales are due to SPAC merger. What's way more important is institutional purchases

Who cares if insiders sold a total of 32 million shares, when Walt Disney, Vanguard, ARKK and BlackRock are holding and continuing to buy about \~50 million shares. The craziest part of it all. CATHIE WOODs, our fucking Queen, added an absolute fuck ton today.

**Closing Statement - Who are you going to trust, a DKNG Investor, User, and Lover, me (and Queen Cathie Woods) or Nathan Anderson the CEO of Hindenburg Research, your corporate crook on steroids, he brags about being better than you're average retail investor/wsb'r on his private twitter, he's been charged in a previous pump and dump scheme for spreading false information under a pseudo name and he may or may not be currently under the investigation by the SEC. His current allegation against DKNG is just another one of his pump and dump's off fake news. DKNG is undervalued, his false accusations of illegal revenue are irrelevant, SBTech only accounts for 1% of DKNG's** ***current*** **total revenue. In the expanding sports-gambling market, their B2B sales will be completely irrelevant as their Sportbook Sales Revenue will \~10x in the next few years as more states legalize sports gambling and DKNG is able to reach the remaining 75% of the U.S. population. Don't listen to the hedgies. Goodluck out there.**

2021-06-16 14:03:49,wallstreetbets,So you can’t refute their evidence. You just say Oregon didn’t catch it so it didn’t exist. But if that’s not the case it’s such a small part of their revenue anyway so whoopdidoo. Knowingly being involved could have much deeper impacts than loss of those revenues.
2021-06-16 10:43:46,wallstreetbets,"You hypocritical mother fuckers.  Hindenburg is bullshit (bearshit?) when they've got Clover and DraftKings in their sights.  Meanwhile, Lordstown refutes their bullshit but I'm still arguing with fuckers here who think they rolled a car down a hill.

No worries though, I'll take the big L on Lordstown if that's where it ends up, as long as you fuckers punish that cunt.  Burn that fucker to the ground."

2021-06-16 18:17:20,wallstreetbets,"He's one of the few good short sellers. He's called out so much fraud, including NKLA and also GSX (levitated only by Hwang). He also pointed out that CLOV is a house of cards built on sketchy practices, which it is. The whole CLOV bid thesis here is 'squeeze the shorts', which is not even a tiny bit incompatible with his view that they are sketchy and have a horrible prospects - there are very good reasons to short CLOV long term even if terrible in the short term because of meme stock status.

Hindenberg has mostly been correct in their assessments of these companies situations, and usually correct on the trade.

He runs his own book for his own profit, not in collusion with other people. As a short seller, he gets investigated all the time I am sure. And, he can be sued into oblivion if he says actually false things.

I don't understand why you guys want to be on team management when team management is sketchy as hell. It's one thing to prop up GME or AMC, but neither of those firms have ethics issues, they just are in a rough spot economically. But latching on to companies allegedly doing illegal stuff that can can lead to business shut down?"

Fast forward a year and they have one EUA and are almost done with phase 2 in many product lines. They still have a huge pipeline of stuff eventually coming to market as well.

Let's get into it. West Fraser (WFG, WFG.TO), in my opinion, is the clear leader in the North American lumber market, they have the most production, have demonstrated the ability to adapt by moving further into the lower-cost US South from their home base in British Columbia and recently added the leader in oriented strand board (OSB) production to their portfolio (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/west-fraser-completes-acquisition-of-norbord-301219018.html). For all you apes, OSB is a composite structural panel that is cheaper than plywood and just as strong.
Now I am sure you have seen the memes about how lumber prices are currently through the roof. This is in fact true.
https://preview.redd.it/id3flxiql3o61.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2c7728688988f56dd5cd7490b1f343a79e819106
This has given companies like WFG a license to essentially print money. Over the last decade or so lumber price to cash cost ratios have averaged 1.1-1.3x ( ~10-30% cash margin). In the decade ending Jan 2020 the Random Length Lumber Continuous Contract averaged $327/MBF (LB00 US:CME https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/lb00/charts). A month ago when lumber prices were ~$1700/MBF, the industry average cash margin was probably more like 400-600%.
Lumber futures have fallen sharply over the last month to ~1000/MBF (cash prices are still higher) but what I am here to tell you is that it doesn't matter! OK, sure it matters, but pre-covid if you had told lumber execs they would be getting $600/MBF in 2021-2022 they would have been absolutely thrilled, let alone $700 where July 2022 contracts are currently trading (the last time lumber prices went “crazy” was in 2018 and they barely touched $600/MBF.
Right now WFG’s market cap is ~4x TTM Earnings and 2.3X annualized Q1 earnings
In Q1 WFG sold 1,389 MMBF of lumber with net sales of $1,275MM - an average price realization of $918/MBF. In Q1 shipments were negatively impacted by seasonal railcar shortages in Canada and a period of extreme winter conditions in the U.S. South.
Their Q2 figures should be significantly better than Q1. Conservatively, I would expect Q2 earnings to be $1 billion. When someone logs on to any financial website and looks at their P/E ratio, it is going to go from including Q2 2020’s 60 million (remember the pandemic?) to Q2 2021s 1 BILLLLIOOON dollars. Their market cap will then be just 3.3X earnings!
In all likelihood their earnings will probably be even higher than that, considering it will be the first quarter to include all of Norbords earnings. PS OSB prices haven’t yet started falling like lumber.
A few more scatterbrained bullets
- Lumber prices are coming down but going to remain high, housing and building markets are hot hot hot
- It takes 2-3 years from the final investment decision to build a new lumber mill, the new capacity in the pipeline is not enough to make up for the hot demand.
- There is some evidence that DIY consumers are waiting to do projects because lumber prices are so high, this demand is delayed, not destroyed. When lumber goes from $10 a piece to $6 a piece they will think they are getting a deal!
- WFG is gonna be LOADED with cash and have an excellent balance sheet whenever this run is over (probably years) and they will be able to further position themselves as the leader in the North American market.
- WFG just increased their dividend and share buyback allocation because they know they are undervalued (h
ttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/west-fraser-increases-dividend-share-214100826.html)
- Of the sell side analysts who have price targets on WFG they range from $99-140 with an average PT of $117. How often do you get that type of consensus among the experts that follow an industry? (https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/WFG/research-ratings) current price ~$67 --thats a lot of upside compared to the average price target!

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ASTS - The SpaceX for Mobile Phones - $6MM YOLO with Real DD Let me start by saying I've invested nearly $6MM in what I believe to be a generational investment opportunity brought about by significant cost disruption in satellite launch costs, innovations in marrying satellite technology to low-earth orbit (""LEO"") applications, and advances in LTE network architecture.  We are early in the commercialization of LEO and $ASTS is at the vanguard.

Inside of SpaceX, most investors rest their hat on the value of Starlink, which will provide FIXED-POINT broadband to customers, albeit at very high costs and with unclear quality.  They value is at $40bn+.  This equates to $200 per share for $ASTS, by way of comparison.  So there ""is a there, there"" in terms of what we are playing for here.

Just like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE**. Starlink cannot translate to mobile unless you intend to haul a trailer behind you with a satellite dish.  See below for an artist rendition of Starlink's mobile solution vs. ASTS' actual mobile solution - your existing handset

&#x200B;

[Haha - let's get back to business...read on](https://preview.redd.it/g1qny0og6k571.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6899104fbe13f6bf1e69417ade25940a9aee38b)

$ASTS AST Spacemobile has re-imagined what's possible after the significant cost disruption in satellite launch, which has allowed it to marry two key innovations to provide satellite connectivity to A REGULAR MOBILE DEVICE:

&#x200B;

1. Because launch costs are just a fraction of what they used to be, $ASTS is launching satellites 10x as large as those of traditional satellite phone satellites. This allows the satellite to do the work, not the phone
2. By innovating with software, $ASTS can make the satellite connection work with existing LTE      networks by only working with the carriers' ground terminals to compensate for the Doppler effect; importantly, ASTS works with any normal phone without requiring any modifications

Here is the overview of the **FACTS**

**PRODUCT:**

• ASTS is building the first-of-a kind and **only** space-based cellular broadband network that is **direct-to-device**; a consumer’s existing handset will work with ASTS’s service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service - ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices

• The constellation utilizes low and mid-band frequencies shared with partners on a non-interference basis; ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use

• ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks

• The service will eliminate coverage gaps, is compatible with all phones, provides broadband data speeds, and is accessible via one-click on a user’s device

**MARKET:**

• ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G market, specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure (e.g. towers) is less developed

• ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular trends: i) falling launch costs, ii) high smartphone penetration, iii) broadband demand iv) 5G IoT proliferation

• ASTS cites 3.3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not connected

• Key regional opportunities include India, Africa, and Equatorial regions

• The service is well-suited for low/medium density sites as well as for emergency back-up during natural disasters

**MANAGEMENT:**

• CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications (sold for $550MM in 2016)

• The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm, NASA, and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom are PhDs

**COMPETITION:**

• ASTS competes with high-cost legacy providers, including Iridium • Legacy satellite providers require unique handsets for users to connect

• ASTS also competes with the build-out of standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment • Competitor Lynk advertises a similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to commercial, financial and technical milestones

**OTHER:** Investors include Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung; all of whom recently invested in the Company's latest financing.  The Company's own coverage banker at Barclays QUIT his job to join ASTS.  The dogs are eating the dog food.

**TIMELINE:**

• April 2019 – BW 1 was launched (the test satellite), validating system architecture and proving they could connect a mobile phone to a satellite and connect to an LTE system  • 2H 2021E will launch BW3, which is a scaled version of the constellation satellite • 2H 2022E/1H 2023E first commercial launches of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage, with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and 168 satellites by YE 2024

**ANALYSIS - THIS IS MY OPINION, AND SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENT**

• ASTS is an exciting event-driven story stock with open-ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven entrepreneurs, significant industry backing, and *bone fide* strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business

• Management funded the seed capital for the business, highlighting their confidence and ‘skin in the game’

• Targeting mobile 5G is a ‘**big idea**’ that augments that excitement generated by fixed-broadband players such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are likely to be present in developing markets

• The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven, leaving investors free to speculate and discount key assumptions, including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU

• The investment set-up is favorable since a high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets, yet requires the capital available in the SPAC market – the set-up is not a ‘foist’ by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but instead a legitimate capital raising exercise to fully-fund the project and remove financing risk

• With 1-year lock-ups on existing investors and PIPE investors, there will be limited free float in what amounted to a “public Series C” financing

• Given future CAPEX, Wall Street banks will see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company

**RISKS:**

• While the *BlueWalker* satellite provided proof-of-concept, there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed

• Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service, reducing appeal for full tower placement

• Realized user penetration and ARPU remain uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution

• ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is susceptible to potential funding risk

**INVESTMENT CHECKLIST:  Good hygiene to make sure something can make money as an investment**

***BUSINESS MODEL***:  ASTS will receive a 50/50 revenue split with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT\&T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow

***GO-TO-MARKET:***  In-place binding agreements with carriers provide ASTS with access to >1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn) • Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people; subsequent phases expand into Europe and N. America – the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024

***DEFENSIBILITY***: ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage • Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market

***CAPITAL***: ASTS is capital intensive and subject to capital availability to complete its full system • Once the constellation is complete, the Company benefits from extreme operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation

***TRACTION***: ASTS appears to have extraordinary commercial partnership traction, however, it is yet unclear what end-user uptake the usage will be • Technical traction was ‘proved’ by the April 2019 launch of the *Bluewalker 1* test satellite

***FINANCIALS***:  With a market cap of \~$1.8bn, the company is expected to generate >$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user

**TECHNOLOGY DETAILS**

***OVERVIEW***: AST & Science (“ASTS”) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct-to-device’ service to normal phones

***BOOMBOX IN SPACE:***  ASTS’ satellites are \~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a 900-square meter array, the system is a large **“loud”** system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones “listen hard” whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones

***SOFTWARE:***  ASTS’ system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial spectrum and telecom networks. The “magic” of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible

***BACKHAUL***:  Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier’s terrestrial spectrum

***CAPACITY***:  Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area

***WHAT DO WE KNOW***:  What has ASTS done to prove its system?

o *Bluewalker1* proved the RF could close (e.g. the power was sufficient to connect a normal phone) and that an LTE connection was achievable utilizing ASTS’ ‘magic’ software; ASTS launched a handset into space with the satellite on the ground to cost-effectively check an important element of technical diligence. *Bluewalker1* allowed for end-to-end connectivity testing, which has been reviewed over the last 1.5 years

o *Bluewalker3* (2H 2021 launch) will be a scaled version of the system, which will de-risk components and demonstrate the full technology. BW3 will allow for software debugging to tune the full system

***RISKS***:  Most of the risks are timing risks. For instance, *Bluewalker3* could spur the need to tune microns, which could delay the system deployment by months. The troubleshooting required will be the beam forming in patterns to maintain a connection while managing handoffs

A launch vehicle delay could delay the testing by 60 to 90 days

***BENT PIPE***:  The satellite itself is not complex – it is bent pipe in the sky; most of the design relates to distributing power. The satellite itself is not involved with processing or routing

Many people are working on solving this problem including the Chinese government. 
https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-54852131

From a physics stand point, its radio wave communication - your phone has GPS and that connects to a satellite in the sky, that also is a radio wave with a different protocol then cellular.

Iridium which is in production today uses satellites to enable cellular communication when you get stuck on Mount Everest and you need to call your wife that you will be late for dinner. They just have a special device because they don't have access to the wireless spectrum of the telecoms. Their devices are also much larger because they need more power to connect to a smaller satellite. 

Has it been proven that a normal cell phone can connect to a satellite and send a message ?

It was proven by lynk - [https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/lynk-sends-the-first-text-message-from-space-directly-to-a-normal-cell-phone/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/lynk-sends-the-first-text-message-from-space-directly-to-a-normal-cell-phone/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD0P-BL09SeC2yr15DWwUv3amOBUq7fAl5dVHhwHbVi6pRV-iJ2H878jTbVErj0RqaAqLZB_qKnLXVXCMpZKSQNrXQc5q0dbG-RB-qdRxyGacYwtMIliN8qjUStt8gxZOfHZhGhLxpimHnLxDwkJA4CZe4p4aAZZdIyrFguuUNaI)

""It works, as founder and CEO Charles Miller explained to me last year, very much the way normal cell signals work. It turns out that when your radio beam goes straight up instead of passing through buildings and the landscape, it can easily reach low Earth orbit. The problem comes with the physics involved in synchronizing the signals — doppler shift and other factors.""


Lynk is using much smaller satellites so they have more latency and more data limitations. 

AST tested this with Bluwalker 1 and are saying to us that the latency is going to be around 40-60ms.

AST CEO explains in this article how its a math equation and their technology just uses a lot larger satellites to ensure low latency. You can read more about it here.

In addition , multiple telecoms have invested. AT&T, Vodafone (they are huge outside North America), Rakuten and even Bell Canada. They have all seen the tech and some have invested in multiple rounds. You don't invest in multiple rounds without doing due diligence on the tech as you need boardroom approval in these large companies ."

2021-06-16 11:18:04,wallstreetbets,"> The satellite itself is not complex

This statement is dubious. The bent-pipe architecture simplifies some types of satellite design (not needing to design inter-satellite links like many have done) but a 900m^2 aperture is never going to be simple. As someone who works in the space industry myself, I wish them all the best in this endeavor, but it's going to be a long hard slog to get a deployable structure that big to work successfully. It will also require some incredible engineering effort. 

The biggest barriers as I see them in the near future for these folks are:


1) Licensing - they must get a license to operate this service in each country that they wish to market in. A good thing/bad thing of LEO is that your satellites only spend tens of minutes over an individual country, so you need to launch in many countries to properly capatalize your asset. This provides many potential roadblock opportunities for competition (both space-based and terrestrial) to stop you at each license fight. Additionally, they're looking to use existing spectrum, which means coordination agreements with every single carrier or *a lot* of interference potential. They are partnering with existing carriers to coordinate, which is good, but they still need to get licensed to send those same bands *from space.*

2) Technology - To realize their plans, AST & Science will need to develop the largest space deployable structure in human history, as there is no launch vehicle large enough to directly launch it. The aperture sizes that are proposed are *rumored* to have existed at this size on ""spooky"" national intelligence satellites with price tags in the billions. Far be it from me to say that anything is impossible, that's not my nature, but this will be an extremely difficult development project. For reference, this is a ~17m diameter dish/phased array, which will need to be true to shape within ~1-2 mm to realize sidelobe targets. 

Additionally, they have not detailed how thet plan to do beam-steering from this large aperture size to properly cover a large area on the ground. If they're in LEO with a 900m^2 aperture in the S-band, the spot size on the ground is going to be ~6-10 km in diameter. With ~200 satellites, and one aperture per satellite, they're going to need to either beam-hop like crazy or do more than one beam per aperture somehow to get full coverage. Otherwise, they get about 0.012% of the Earth's surface area at a time. 

3) Space Operations Experience - Bluewalker1 is a nanosatellite, with no manuvering capability or attitude control system. This means that as far as the rest of the space community is concerned, this satellite is a ""dumb brick"" which requires no active coordination with the company that launched it (manuverable sats will just have to dodge it). Once they intend to operate a real constellation, they will need to develop propulsion hardware, attitude control and determination hardware and software, autonomous collision avoidance software, and a team of operations staff to fly and manage the constellation and coordinate with other operators. This is a significant undertaking. 

4) Total bandwidth per satellite - 1.2MM GB/month sounds good when you say it that way, but that's only ~3.6 gigabits per second per satellite (assuming GB in the post is giga**bytes**, to be charitable). That puts total constellation throughput at ~a single high quality fiber line. Total subscriber density will be low, on the order of 0.004 subscribers/km^2 (assuming satellites are flying polar, 0.5 megabit per second per subscriber, and they're going for global coverage). This means that while it may be easy to talk to their system using existing hardware, very few people will be able to do so at a time.

EDIT: *IF* they can build it, this link budget is technically feasible. You can close a link to a cell phone from this altitude and serve it high bandwidth (to one cell phone at a time...). That's not really my issue with the system."

2021-06-16 10:00:04,wallstreetbets,"A couple questions about the cellular plan:   


1) What's the orbital altitude for the constellation? Considering that SpaceX and BlueOrigin want to put a combined 45k satellites (42k for spacex, 3600 for BlueOrigin), it suggests there isn't a lot of space to add more satellites in super low earth orbit.   
2) What would the expected latency be? The satellite phone industry now has a good amount of latency which makes talking noticeably different than a landline or cellular connection."

This is the next level, the next tier, of communications services sector infrastructure. It will be just as disruptive as when phones connected to cables evolved to connect to towers.

Which rockets are capable of launching? I haven’t spent enough time to fully flesh this out, but let’s just say some companies are better at staying on time than others.

Why does any American who lives in a town with solid coverage (80%+ of the US population) have any need for this? The vast majority of data transmission will be from terrestrial stations.

2021-06-16 10:53:37,wallstreetbets,"First round Starlink beta user in Canada.  


For too many years rural internet providers feasted on fat returns as the only game in town, never did they have to put the consumer first, so it was a no-brainer to sign up for Starlink. Here are my reasons:  


1. Cheaper than the competition. ((Previous provider 50Mbit connection is $157, Starlink 300Mbit (and growing) is $129).  

2. Speeds. Our out of the box speeds were between 50 and 150Mbit. The latest upgrade saw a 100% increase in beta speeds. The 10Gbit in the future seems like a pipe dream but I can foresee the 1Gbit connection being a reality very soon.  

3. Easy setup. It took me 5 minutes to get everything together, and 30 minutes to be connected to the internet.  

4. Mobility. Teardown of Dishy is simple. Once they do away with the Geo-lock, I'll be able to pack it up and bring it along anywhere we decide to adventure to.  


SpaceX is the frontrunner. The telephone is an aging technology and will go the way of the dinosaurs once everything is connected to the internet 24/7. There are few things I wouldn't give up to be an investor pre-IPO. I await patiently."

This is what has been conveyed to me in my diligence in talking with industry folks.  

\- They are launching BW3 out of Kazakhstan on board a Soyuz ride share.  The satellite's aperture will be mechanically unfolded, but I don't know the exact specifics. 

\- Yes the spectrum coordination is part of the magic and complexity.  No one said this is going to be easy!  But working with carriers as you point out is critical.  Having access to the best propagating spectrum will also come with technical challenges to avoid interference.

\- BW3 launch is intended to test and tweak propulsion.

If you look at a few things you should be wary-

Some of the company leadership failed at numerous space startups or at their respective companies and this is just their next stop on their “serial entrepreneurship”

Secondly - I don’t think they’ll get high bandwidth that satellite setup. This is more likely to be SMS style comms.

Also since you are familiar with all this am I correct on this point as well: 5G can’t even travel for more than a few miles beyond a tower from the ground, much less than traveling from LEO. The power required for the signal to reach the surface would be insane and well beyond the power supplies satellites can handle"

2. Latency should be ok given its LEO but it will surely be variable depending many factors, namely: location relative to nearest satellite, satellites location relative to nearest backhaul link, and of course where u are pinging. I haven't done any math, but I'd expect between 50-100 ms ping for the first deployment. As they build out more satellites and backhaul links and optimize the correction software this will improve."

2021-06-16 10:17:54,wallstreetbets,"The limiting factor is FCC bandwidth allocation, not satellite space constraints. Can you fit 45k cars driving around the surface of the earth? Now imagine they can do this in layers up to 1000 km thick. It’s not a huge problem. But you can’t go beyond your bandwidth allocation and that determines your throughput.

I’m extremely skeptical of this phone company being little more than crappy next gen Iridium. Typically satellite tech, like satellite to satellite communication, is easier said than done."

It should work both ways but at least shows in theory - fundamental of physics that a radio wave can communicate from a phone to a satellite.

If so, I'd suggest you read again"
2021-06-16 14:24:50,wallstreetbets,"Whether the OP intended to or not, they definitely made the satellite system sound like the easy part. Their risks are about things like cell phone battery life, for example. 

I'm extremely curious to read those notes, I think especially getting to a good understanding of how they plan to steer beams and cover large areas of the world would be really important. 

As it stands, the satellites just seem to me to have too small of a spot size, too low of a per-sat bandwidth, and too few of them to get to an effective global coverage system without a ton of beam hopping or defocused coverage (and consequential loss of latency and/or throughput). I'm happy to be proven wrong! Obviously there are smart people working at that company, and they have chosen their system design for a reason. 

The deployables development is always going to be technically possible, as long as atoms can exist in that shape there's some way to get them there. The primary question for me is how long the development slog to design a refolding aperture is going to take. GEO systems typically fold 2-6m apertures, which fit into existing fairings and just basically have a hinge off of the bus. The really fancy ones fold down the middle. For a 17m system, the active aperture needs to have oragami-style folds in it, which need to pop into really defined spots with a ton of repeatability and low snag risk. The only place I'm ""aware"" of this (and I don't have a clearance so it's just rumors) are the NRO spooky sats which are probably made from carbon fiber/$100 bill honeycomb."
2021-06-16 14:14:51,wallstreetbets,"This is technically possible. I don't think anyone should be skeptical of the link budget, it's pretty simple math to match dB up to dB down and atmospheric losses are well understood. You can do ""high"" bandwidth to a cell phone sized antenna. Assuming ~6 dBi on the cell phone antenna, it can close at their proposed sizes and frequencies according to my back of the envelope link budget. 

I'm mostly skeptical of the timeline, licensing, cost, and per-satellite bandwidth. They either need a fuckton of satellites or a fuckton of beam hopping, both of which suck in different ways. Beam hopping drives latency through the roof, and effective throughput down."
2021-06-16 16:35:39,wallstreetbets,"You could entertain that idea if you think that it’s possible for Rakuten, Vodaphone, and AT&T to have worked with AST for years now while getting scammed at the same time. They employ over 200 engineers and hiring as well. 

Just because previous ventures for leadership had failed in the past does not mean this endeavor is a cash out. This is a very different space market in 2021."
2021-06-16 13:39:39,wallstreetbets,"2- you have no idea what you’re talking about.  The ISS was put together over dozens and dozens of launches and built in space. This systems is talking about launching a massive single dish in space.  Sorry, but just hand waving and saying “the SpaceX vehicle for example is massive” doesn’t cut it in this business. The Falcon 9 fairing wouldn’t accommodate this type of launch and do you think this company could afford to launch on the SpaceX’s bigger rocket in 10 years?"
2021-06-16 16:25:59,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately you're not correct, 5G is a marketing term, not a frequency. Many of the frequencies uses by mm-wave 5G towers are the same ones that have been used in space for nearly 70 years. They propagate fine from space, and satellites have more than enough power to broadcast them. 

There's no physics reason that what they're doing is impossible, it's just a really really hard engineering problem on an extremely aggressive timeline, with a lot of remaining technical and regulatory risk."

Both companies will be in competition to a degree but will still serve their own purpose. For anyone who needs to use P2P applications Starlink will be the clear winner. Starlink is currently operational with about 18ms latency whereas land based 5g towers are operational at about 80ms (will be worse from a sat).

2021-06-16 11:07:50,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain more on the tech limitations ? 

This is how I see it . 

From a physics stand point, its radio wave communication - your phone has GPS and that connects to a satellite in the sky, that also is a radio wave with a different protocol then cellular.

Iridium which is in production today uses satellites to enable cellular communication when you get stuck on Mount Everest and you need to call your wife that you will be late for dinner. They just have a special device because they don't have access to the wireless spectrum of the telecoms. Their devices are also much larger because they need more power to connect to a smaller satellite. 

Has it been proven that a normal cell phone can connect to a satellite and send a message ?

It was proven by lynk - [https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/lynk-sends-the-first-text-message-from-space-directly-to-a-normal-cell-phone/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/lynk-sends-the-first-text-message-from-space-directly-to-a-normal-cell-phone/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD0P-BL09SeC2yr15DWwUv3amOBUq7fAl5dVHhwHbVi6pRV-iJ2H878jTbVErj0RqaAqLZB_qKnLXVXCMpZKSQNrXQc5q0dbG-RB-qdRxyGacYwtMIliN8qjUStt8gxZOfHZhGhLxpimHnLxDwkJA4CZe4p4aAZZdIyrFguuUNaI)

""It works, as founder and CEO Charles Miller explained to me last year, very much the way normal cell signals work. It turns out that when your radio beam goes straight up instead of passing through buildings and the landscape, it can easily reach low Earth orbit. The problem comes with the physics involved in synchronizing the signals — doppler shift and other factors.""

&#x200B;

Lynk is using much smaller satellites so they have more latency and more data limitations. 

&#x200B;

AST tested this with Bluwalker 1 and are saying to us that the latency is going to be around 40-60ms.

AST CEO explains in this article how its a math equation and their technology just uses a lot larger satellites to ensure low latency. You can read more about it here.

Could another company beat them to it? Yes, but they have over 1k proprietary patents. They are a first mover in this race, and bypassing cell towers is massive. 

I see the future of communication here. I see the revenue streams easily. It's about reaching them. And I'd rather be in early than late to the party. I bought expecting to hold for years and years, not months. It'll drop back down to 9.5 probably, and I'll buy more."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"It’s time to buy the VIX 🌈🐻 reporting for duty…

Volatility is the only thing on earth that isn’t at it’s all time high. UVXY is where I am starting to allocate funds. Yes, it hurts in the pelvic region to hold that fund because of the decay, but we’re at an excellent entry point.

We are in a bona fide “everything bubble” brought on by extremely loose central bank policies across the globe. The market has simply melted upwards for the last year because of the implication that any negative market move will be attacked by the Fed. Combine that with “vaccine optimism” and excitement about reopening, and you have people buying the promise that better times are coming. Now we’re reopened, so now what? Here are the risks we face:

1. Insane valuations - The P/E ratio of the S&amp;P just eclipsed Dot Com Bubble levels. 

2. Inflation. Whether you believe it’s transitory or not, it’s here, and it handcuffs how accommodative the Fed can be. The velocity of money brought on by reopening will only make it worse.

3. Stimulus expiration - 25 states have vowed to cut off boosted unemployment benefits in the next 30 days. Yes, there’s an abundance of jobs, but many will not be willing to work for less than what they were just receiving from the government. 

4. COVID- It’s not covered much by the media these days, but it’s still having a huge impact on other parts of the world. Additionally, new strains are out there which will be mobilized once travel resumes.

5. Tax Increases - Remember that concern we all heard about during election season? That’s still out there. Taxes will have to increase to pay for what the government just spent. Corporate and individual.

I fully expect to be called all sorts of names for being pessimistic on the market. Shit is going to hit the fan at some point, and the longer this melt-up continues the worse it will be. All I’m saying here is to remember that yes, risk does exist, and crashes happen. 

**Don’t be afraid to NOT be retarded.**

The world is coming out of a year and a half of pandemic. The UVXY has literally been going down from $400 as we marched closer to vaccine availability. Sure there may be a lot of microbubbles in the market right now but overall the macro on the market looks solid because everything is getting back to normal. I don't think from a macro perspective the VIX jumps until there's another major destabilizing world event.

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Five STONKS you need to know (ASO, HIBB, BGFV, VSTO, DKS) For decades, Sporting Goods retail shops were where you invested if you liked to watch your money burn. These were sloppily run ass-backwards, dimly lit stores selling chewing tobacco, beef jerky and fishing rods to your old uncle, or crappy nylon jogging shorts to your weird neighbor.

As recently as 2017, some of these large 1,000 store chains adamantly REFUSED to have one iota of an online presence. Like [Hibbet Sports](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/07/24/hibbett-sports/505007001/). And bankruptcies and consolidations were the  [norm.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/03/07/sporting-goods-stores-retail-bankruptcy/98682338/)

But that was 2017. Since then the entire landscape has changed. And COVID was the PED that these companies needed. With the world trapped at home, suddenly everyone and their brother had to buy a home gym. Youth sports have become a $10k a year household expense for many families with constantly evolving carbon fiber hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks, and baseball bats that need to be replaced every year because your kid grows out of them. And these aren't the $15 aluminum bats we grew up on. They are $300 bats. Oh yeah, and they sell guns, which if you haven't noticed, are skyrocketing in sales. We went from about 900,000 FBI background checks a month during Obama's first term to 2.5 million a month during Trump, to 4M+ per month during Biden. See the trend? Whether you follow politics or care or not, ""fear based"" gun ownership and gun buying is here to stay. 

And NONE OF THIS IS PRICED IN TO THESE STONKS. These are still valued like they will be out of business in a month. How these companies aren't private equity takeover targets or merger/buyout targets, I have no idea. If I had $20B, I'd take all of these companies private at a 50% premium tomorrow.

ASO, HIBB, BGFV, VSTO, and DKS trade at P/E multiples of 7. 

Yes 7. 

And they are having 30%+ growth rates. They are blowing past earnings estimates (beating them by 100% or more). They aren't technologically inept anymore. They view on-line sales as an integral part of a brick-and-mortar holistic customer experience. Shit, even Hibbet has a[gorgeous website](https://www.hibbett.com/) that looks like Apple's website. I ordered a lacrosse stick from ASO last week. free shipping to Massachusetts, and it arrived in 2 days.

If we look back to 2017, we saw them at 20-30 P/E ratios, and earnings that were fraction of what they are now. And the balance sheets are greatly improved. They have bought back shares, lowered debt (for the most part, although some have used debt to buy back stock), and they have been BLOWING EARNINGS OUT OF THE WATER. And some have mountains of cash on their balance sheets. As big as they are, they are still relatively small - some under $1B market cap.

Best part - they are all on a bit of a dip this week.

Not financial advice, do your research, check out their earnings history and growth, and I own lots of each of these. 

I know ASO has a small but loyal following here, but these other tickers are just as well positioned as ASO in my view. Just trying to get things on folks' radar. Make your own decisions folks. But I like these stocks."

Even though slightly higher inflation was expected due to the stimulus checks and the reopening of the economy, the current trends are worrying. As we can see from the chart, even though inflation trends till March were manageable, now it seems to be picking up pace. May’21 CPI is almost 2.8X May’19 CPI. (2020 CPI was down mainly because of the strict lockdowns following the pandemic)

Keeping an inflation-hedged asset class in your portfolio during this transitionary period can work out well in case we go into a steeply rising inflation. This brings us to what are the  

**Best asset classes that can be used as a hedge against inflation**

**Stocks**

Stocks are a good long-term investment to hedge against inflation. Even though you might have a short-term impact due to the uncertainties surrounding inflation, great companies would be able to pass on the increasing price to the customers. You must look into companies with pricing power (think Apple) to raise prices on their customers without significantly affecting their overall sales. One important type of stock to avoid is high-growth stocks as the valuation of the company is heavily based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company thereby detracting a lot of value investors.

**Commodities**

Commodities are raw materials used for creating the products consumers buy. It provides both inflation protection and diversification to your portfolio. Because commodities are “real assets”, they tend to benefit from rising inflation. As demand for goods and services increases, the price of those goods and services usually rises as well, as do the prices of the commodities used to produce those goods and services. As you can see from the below chart, commodities have a weak correlation to both Equity and Bond markets.

**Real Estate and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**

Real estate income rises with inflation. As inflation rises, so do property value and the amount you can charge for rent. Given the normal forms of real estate requires high initial investments, an alternative could be REITs. A REIT consist of a pool of real estate (commercial, residential and industrial properties) that pays out dividends to its investors.

According to [this study](https://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/716.pdf) conducted by the Wharton School of Business

>Consumer price inflation (CPI) in the U.S. was 13.5% during 1979, the worst year since 1947. Dividend income from REITs traded through the stock exchange averaged 21.2% that year, and total returns amounted to 24.4%, more than preserving for REIT investors the purchasing power that they had lost to inflation.

**Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)**  

Never in my wildest dreams, I would have imagined writing about treasury bonds in wallstreetbets. Yet here we are! 

TIPS are a type of treasury security issued by the US govt which is indexed to inflation. As inflation rises, TIPS adjusts in price to maintain it’s real value. To make it simpler, if you invest $100 in TIPS and the coupon rate is 1%, if there is no inflation you will receive $1 for coupon payments that year. If inflation rises by 5%, they will adjust the coupon so that you get $1.05 instead of the $1.

**International Diversification**

There are several well-developed economies outside the US that do not rise and fall in relation to the US market (Italy, Australia, etc.). Adding stocks/bonds from these or similar countries can help hedge the portfolio against sudden local swings.

**Gold**

Gold is often touted as one of the best methods to hedge against inflation. I have kept it last as the performance of gold during previous inflationary periods has been spotty.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gdwkgb9grm571.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0785e15a993d10e35490f424afa862fa9a45e44)

Gold investors lose 10% on average from 1980-84 when the annual inflation rate was 6.5% and lost 7.6% from 1988-91 when inflation was 4.6%. But the performance of gold was spectacular during the period of 1973-79(when the inflation was 8.8%). The mixed record raises some concerns about using Gold as a hedge against inflation.   

**Conclusion**

Whether we like it or not, inflation is here. The only question right now is whether it’s going to transitionary as the Fed’s explained or whether the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force Fed to increase their interest rates. The Federal Reserve meeting that concludes today will finally give us some insight into how they are going to tackle the current spike in inflation. Whatever their decision may be, it’s a good idea to prepare some hedging strategies for your portfolio!

REITs? Yeah, inflation can increase rental income until inflationary pressures indirectly influence upward input costs for the broader economy leading to lay-offs/job loss, business closures/foreclosures/evictions...

Well, strap the fuck in, I'm gonna pour some DD into your dirty mouths like a frat boy in summer bash of 18'.  This stock is going to fucking moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now look this fucking chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/npxtu4g4nm571.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a3701fa50bbcacca8116f6246cdabfa81aafa81

I used Marketwatch data to calculate net ITM open interest for calls less ITM open interest for puts (all with expiration on June 18, this Friday) for several popular ape stocks. Then I divided this number by average daily volume for each stock. Resulting ratio is thus a fraction of an average trading day that is needed to settle expiring “excess” call options this Friday. To make this ratio more evident I multiplied it by 6.5 hours to get the number of regular trading hours needed to cover outstanding excess call options.

Is this table an accurate predictor of a gamma S-word this Friday? There are 2 factors that may influence the accuracy/relevance of the data shown: 1) options data and strike prices are accurate as of today, 6/14. If any of the stock prices and option open interest change significantly till Friday these number might change 2) It is hard to estimate the percentage of the calls (and puts) that are already covered. For simplicity I assume that the percentage of covered options is the same for all stocks. This data then indicates the relative likelihood of upward price movement inspired by option expiration this Friday.

Note that $ASO and $CRSR occupy the first two lines not because they have an extraordinarily high excess call open interest but mostly due to their (relatively) low daily volume. So even small call covering will have profound effect on the price. It is hard to imagine spending 4.5 hours of trading to just cover outstanding calls. I understand that in reality this number will be less due to covered calls but even an hour of trading seems huge.

2021-06-16 14:23:31,wallstreetbets,"This is going to open a whole can of worms in certain communities if it is passed. I dont think it will pass and here is my short take: 

In some areas, the going talk on why crime and more specifically, violent crime is so high and has been for so long is because of the illegal drug market. Whenever that market opens up, and crime is still rampant, certain people run out of excuses on why things are still status quo. Additionally, you think these higher crime cities who profit from throwing people into the jail system are just going to allow their coffers to dry up? 

over 1,500,000 arrests in 2019 for drug-related offenses (per FBI). That's a LOT of fine and bail money, and lawyer money, money going into jails that make money from inmate counts. Free community service labor, and everything else that wraps into these programs, like paying for counseling or classes etc. You think the local governments are going to be all like ""yeah, that's cool, take that huge chunk of money from us"" without a fight? Else, where do they then recoup that lost income that sadly counted on year after year after decade after forever? Hell, someone in the WH made her bones throwing a LOT of people in jail and prison over drugs, and bragged about it. 

With any of that in mind, let's say they do pass this. Where are plays to be made in making money that arent as obvious as ""lol buy weed stock"""

2021-06-16 10:14:39,wallstreetbets,"Depends, how white are you?"
2021-06-16 15:25:03,wallstreetbets,"No, decriminalize isn't the same as legalize.

It would still be illegal, just a minor offense instead of a major one.

(and state laws would still apply)"
2021-06-16 12:33:27,wallstreetbets,"I mean the way the question is worded today, my assumption would be yes. The question is whether you’re “an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any other controlled substance.” 

If those substances are no longer unlawful, then the answer to that question would be “No” thus making you eligible to own a firearm. 

The situation right now with most states is that while they may have made marijuana or other substances legal at the state level, it’s still federally illegal. It’s the Feds who are asking you that question on the firearms application. 

That said, there’s nothing preventing the ATF from removing the word “unlawful” from the question and keeping it a requirement even if the fed makes all controlled substances legal. However, if they do that they should also include Alcohol, since they would essentially be on the same level now. 

I also highly doubt this legislation makes its way through both chambers with the necessary approvals. There will absolutely be representatives on both sides who oppose the legalization of controlled substances. We’ve had past weed bills that have failed to go through, so I’m not sure why they think all of a sudden an all substances bill would make it through."
2021-06-16 12:34:43,wallstreetbets,"No. Mercurial, soft and ineffectual drug laws are just there to arrest you for owning guns. If the government really wanted to stop people doing drugs it could by giving the death penalty to all bulk sellers but the laws are written so that they are actually gun laws"

2021-06-16 12:35:22,wallstreetbets,Yep. The fact they've included all substances in it gives it zero chance. Weed/Psilocybin could hold up though.

2021-06-16 19:25:47,wallstreetbets,I read the headline and thought why would they even waste their time?
2021-06-16 13:16:58,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily.  There's a lot of drug support from the right wing as well.  Especially around pot, maybe not meth or crack, but low level there certainly is bilateral support.  People should be able to do what they want within their household, everyone that's 18 is *physically* adults.  I see no issue as it hurts no one but themselves."

2021-06-16 17:21:56,wallstreetbets,"I could understand coke and crack. A lot of public officials do those. So many business owners and powerful people are straight up coke-heads and you wouldn't even realize it, they just seem quick witted and energetic."

2021-06-16 13:36:25,wallstreetbets,"To be completely fair, legalizing murder would decrease crime as well. Can't commit a crime if it's not illegal, so that's not usually a good argument.

2021-06-16 14:53:49,wallstreetbets,expect little to no change
2021-06-16 16:53:53,wallstreetbets,I wonder how many of the deaths to drugs are specifically because it's illegal. Between having to go to the shadiest mofo alive to get it to getting tainted ass shit etc.
2021-06-16 11:41:41,wallstreetbets,For the love of god don't make it Schedule II and turn over control to Big Pharma.
2021-06-16 11:07:01,wallstreetbets,Decriminalizing federally would allow states to do their own thing. Less resistance than forcing Kansas and Alabama to legalize it

2021-06-16 10:58:49,wallstreetbets,So are people like you incapable of doing research? Have you looked into what happened to Portugal when they did this? How their rates of addiction and ODs plummeted after blanket decriminalization?

My state decriminalized cannabis.  You still have to go to court, you still have to pay a fine, and if you don't want the misdemeanor on your record you have the option to pay $300-$500 for a class on drug dependency.  For weed."
2021-06-16 15:25:22,wallstreetbets,"The democrats know this bill won't pass because it will have almost no republican support. That's the purpose of the bill.

It may be cynical, but it's still true. 

It's also interesting that the party of supposedly less government involvement in business and personal choices really *really* hates applying that philosophy to drugs. Or abortion. Or marriage. Or religion."
2021-06-16 13:18:37,wallstreetbets,"I’m for legalizing Drugs, Prostitution, gambling but I’m not retarded, there’s zero chance of drugs getting decriminalized. Weed is not happening either because the VP said that it’s not a priority."

2021-06-16 14:11:17,wallstreetbets,Lol. The drugs are already here and the population is already exposed. With decriminalization people can get help instead of spend their lives in prison. It's more humane and more cost effective. Decriminalization does not equal legalization

2021-06-16 11:23:18,wallstreetbets,More importantly it would allow the weed industry to open business bank accounts and recieve loans for expansion. It would be a massive catalyst

2021-06-16 17:11:03,wallstreetbets,"Plus, ""the only reason we're drug testing so rigorously is because it's still federally illegal"" is a phrase often used. Who gives a fuck what someone does when they aren't on the clock? No company actually cares if you do drugs as long as you perform well and aren't obvious about it. It's mainly because the insurance company requires it or the company you are working for (or union) wants to control you as much as possible."
2021-06-16 15:37:33,wallstreetbets,"That's not real decriminalization though. Decriminalization would be making it no longer a crime, aka no fines, no punishment, no court, etc. It would make it the equivalent of, say, cigarettes. You can have cigarettes on your person without threat of punishment, but don't get caught selling them without a license to do so.

Fining people for carrying drugs would mean it's still seen as a crime in the law's eyes. That goes against the word ""decriminalization"" itself."

Kamala harris does not dictate bills. Pot alone was almost legalized not to long ago, and is legal in, I think, more then half the states at this point or is decriminalized down to a fine for possession.

2021-06-16 11:23:03,wallstreetbets,"Almost all gun control laws since the invention of gun control laws originate from blatant aims to remove the right to bear arms from minority or economically stagnated (often conveniently both) populations. See: the black panthers you mentioned, gun control in the south aimed at disarming blacks during the Civil rights era, melting point laws in the north intended to remove low-cost firearms from circulation and thus: ""the poors"" access to self defense, and even going back to the NFA, ad nauseum. Every gun control law on the books is antithetical to human rights and individual sovereignty, and every proposition to further restrict your (or your weird neighbor that you disagree with politically) rights should be opposed vehemently because, as so many of us have overlooked in the past few years, the individual is the smallest minority there is...and tyranny has to start somewhere.

No, that's not what those terms mean.

Decriminalize means making something a minor misdemeanor.   IE: a ticket but no arrest.  There are no dispensaries or legal markets for it - it's still a black market product.

Legalize means make it fully legal with no criminal penalty for possession, although it may still have some restrictions such as user age or use in public.

There is nothing good that comes throwing people into cages for simple possession. It exposes them to more hardened criminals and normalizes these behaviors in an entire segment of the population. You'll find different statistics on this, but it is estimated between 3 and 5% of the American population has been to prison at one point in their life. The numbers for jail are even higher. On any given day roughly 1% of our population is currently incarcerated. It is beyond time to end this cycle. If usage is truly detrimental to a person's well-being, wpuldn't it make more sense to place them in a rehabilitation facility instead of a cage with people that commit more serious and violent crimes?"

""Spree shooting"" *isn't* a problem in the US, especially when you consider every stat collecting entity uses a more generous definition of ""mass shooting""  than any other country in the world, that more than 70% of FBI recorded gun deaths are suicides, that more than 50% of what's left is made up of justified, accidental, police involved, or otherwise noncriminal shootings.  
In short, I don't care. Gun owners in this county have been sacrificing their rights since 1934. And we haven't got a single God damn thing in return for what we've given up.  

I would agree however, the solution in large stems from better mental health outlets, and actually enforcing the laws we have already about violent felons or mentally unstable people accessing weapons that they shouldn't have (which we don't do on such a level that we might as well not have said laws), but I disagree strongly in granting that power to (especially) the federal government, because they can barely collect taxes efficiently.  
Look... I'm not a smart enough man to debate the in's and out's of federally socialized medicine, at least not beyond the fact that I don't trust the government to do *anything* decently. At all. And I've got a history of government incompetence/straight-up maliciousness almost as old as the country to go off of to back that presumption up."

2021-06-16 12:24:45,wallstreetbets,"I get that saving is tough, but if you're buying a 250k home you can put down as little as 3% (7.5k) and get it. You potentially can take a loan against your 401k if you need to get to the 7.5K, someone smarter than me should confirm that though.  I know the PMI will get you, but I don't think it is that crazy, something like 150 a month.  Also if your in a highly desirable area you can refinance after your home hits the 80% range of the NEW appraised value to wipe out the PMI-- major risk here is the new rate may screw you.

So assuming:

1. Good Credit (740+)
2. 30Yr mortgage with 3% down (7.5k on 250k)
3. a rough APR of 3%
4. Pmi of \~150 a month,
5. Add insurance around 100 a month
6. 72 month loan on your 401k roughly 150 a month.

You're looking at a total payment of something like 1400-1500 a month.  That said, I am not obtuse, I know the 7.5k is the hardest part no matter how you slice it!"

Mix in some historically low interest rates and a lot of white collar folks getting the OK from their employers for indefinite remote work and we have ourselves a lot of upward pressure on home prices."

Gamma is just the rate of change of delta, so would inform on how quickly your hedge would need to shift to account for underlying price changes 

If you're interested, look up Dynamic Hedging for some details on how a MM would stay directionally neutral. If you can handle the math *Option Pricing and Volatility* by Natenburg is an excellent resource"
2021-06-16 10:12:50,wallstreetbets,"Interest rates being so low give investment property owners a lot of room to move rental rates down if the market requires it and still be profitable.

The bigger issue is that home ownership is becoming less attainable for individuals, removing a major source of long term wealth."
2021-06-16 10:08:09,wallstreetbets,"Ah well that’s the real crisis few seem to be talking about. 

The only variables many retail consumers seem to look at when assessing whether or not there’s a housing bubble include: new home builds, mortgages applications, mortgage forbearance, etc. and fail to take into account Federal eviction moratoriums on *rentals* (both apartment and home rentals), which are strongly intertwined with the housing market. 

I was speaking to a property manager of a large metropolitan apartment complex and they have numerous tenants 10 months behind on rent, owing over $40,000, who they can’t evict! I’ve even seen this happen in luxury rentals, potentially indicating the problem is pervasive (i.e. not isolated to lower income folks). Small mom-and-pop landlords who need tenant income have been silently elbowed out of the market, their properties snapped up by hedge funds, private equity groups, etc. who have enough cash to weather the moratorium. 

The government is not going to abruptly end the moratorium and trigger mass evictions, but eventually, these people will be evicted in waves, while others find ways to pay back their debt. 

In all likelihood, these evictions will drive down the price of rentals— which drives down home values since lower rental costs make home ownership less appealing. 

Or perhaps the excess demand for rentals (which currently surpasses market supply) will fill the void - roughly stabilizing rent prices. 

It’s anyone’s best guess. As 07/08 showed, not even 99.9% of “the experts” really know."

2021-06-16 12:43:07,wallstreetbets,"Understood, but the comment I was replying to wasn't about that.  At some point the housing market will settle a bit.  I would guess in the next 6-9 months.  Companies have learned that people can/prefer to be offsite for work.  Meaning that they can work from anywhere.   


The place hit the hardest by this is/will be Silicon Valley and other tech hubs.  The majority of those jobs can be done remotely.  These areas also have some of the highest cost of living in the US.  So they are move to lower COL areas such as nashville, raleigh-durham ect-- basically anywhere with similar weather and costs considerably less to live.  


In about 6-9 months I anticipate the mass exodus to calm a bit since vaccination rates are going to allow people to start going back to work again.  Once things return to business as usually I think people will realize how much going into work sucks, and push for offsite (again), that's why I say about 9 months.  


I have friends in the same boat, their other problem is that they are being pushed to the edge of their budget meaning they have no room to fight/negotiate.  This is on houses that 3 years ago were 100k+ less than they are now."

2021-06-16 11:47:26,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I know. We really didn't want to do it but kept losing out on houses because of that. Our realtor advised against it but said he hasn't had a winning bid without one. House seemed well taken care of and you could tell the previous owner had attention to detail. Even then you never know. Our friends bought a house with an inspection before all of this and is still ripping the house apart because the inspection was shit so can still get burned even with one. At least I got majorly overpaid for my house and allowed us to take this leap with some financial security."

2021-06-16 10:17:21,wallstreetbets,"The housing market prices have just continually climbed for 60 years or more. It is unsustainable.

You have houses that used to be worth $20,000, maybe $50,000 in today's economy, currently priced over $500,000... I imagine it will crash again at some point, either that or the dollar loses value faster. 

Something has to give. 

The inequality in this country has been eroding the foundations of our economy. When only the rich can afford to buy anything then manufacturing and ownership no longer has value because there aren't enough buyers. There is no market."
2021-06-16 10:11:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man we are living in a illusory world, the economy needs desperate work from the ground up.

This is turning out like a game of monopoly, at some point you realize who the winner is and there is no coming back from a game when someone owns all of the properties and all of the wealth.

Inequality is the biggest threat beside climate change and the progressives who talked about it were neglected in favor of Hillary and Biden. Absurd. Playing by the rules isn't solving our most pressing priorities. What do we do? Sit back and watch the world burn? 

The lack of accountability is depressing"

2021-06-16 12:05:57,wallstreetbets,"08 was really a blip. If you look at the data it was brief and during that time most people couldn’t qualify for a home loan when lending tightened up. Prices quickly rebounded higher. 

What’s different than 08 is you no longer have supply. With investors and firms now buying up houses and whole subdivisions of single family homes as rental properties. Those prices aren’t going to do much but continue the upward trend. 

https://i.imgur.com/xYYLFzQ.jpg"
2021-06-16 17:10:12,wallstreetbets,"Surprise that people are actually arguing with you on this one. It is WSB I guess after all. As soon as interest rates rise the housing market will decline. Won’t be as bad at 2008 but definitely will fall as people won’t be able to afford it in that regard.

Also a recession hitting will make the housing market drop as well as long as their isn’t a trillion dollar aid program like last year"

2021-06-16 10:12:50,wallstreetbets,"The moratorium on foreclosures and evictions will end. Presumably. But the problem is that no one is really behind on their mortgages. Industry delinquency is something like 4.5% which is not much worse than any other time period. So yes, inventory will finally start to go up as these foreclosed homes become available... but it'll take months for the foreclosure proceedings to finalize and get the houses ready to be listed. I'm super bullish on UWMC, but that's because I see the housing market staying very competitive for the rest of the year. Things will sell quickly and for far too much money until the end of the year. UWMC benefits in these super fast sales because they close a loan in half the time as Rocket and one third the time of the industry average. Their buyers have far fewer chances to get pipped by a higher offer once the contracts are signed."
2021-06-16 15:42:57,wallstreetbets,"That’s what the media said about GME and AMC, but if people are just gonna buy and hold that price is flat at best (buyer perspective), but more likely going up. The ones with the houses get the tendies. Price is going no where but up unless we have a major economic collapse.

Ask yourself, did the SEC come to stop the hedge’s nonsense in the market, nope. Did the congress put in protections after the collapse in ‘08, nope (they almost kinda did, but then tossed it in the trash later). Did the congress protect citizens from foreign buyers buying up homes as money stores and investment vehicles, nope. Don’t expect the Government to help with the housing issue."
2021-06-16 11:27:32,wallstreetbets,"Heres the reallity that is being evaded: The Fed can print money at will, faith in the dollar is misplaced. Thats the correction going on"
2021-06-16 19:05:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, AMC and Cloudflare turned out terrible for me. And I'm only up 40% on UWMC. My favorite part about UWMC is the $7 price floor built into the share price. The CEO is a shark."

2021-06-16 12:50:15,wallstreetbets,"They can't just keep going up indefinitely though (at least at current rates of increase). Eventually it just becomes flat-out unsustainable if people are paying like 50% of their income for housing because there's no other choice. Right now we're seeing most of a couple of generations being priced out of home ownership, and that's not going to be allowed long-term. At some point either the market will correct itself or the government will step in to push prices down (through regulation, taxes, or building housing to increase supply)."

Now that is changing with technology and removed barriers to investing for retailers."
2021-06-16 13:03:07,wallstreetbets,"Government very likely isn't going to step in. If they did not do it in '08 (they really should have) and opened the market to government supported institutional buy up, the chance they change that course is almost non-existent (Biden was part of the admin that put that into place, I don't expect him to change course).

What's likely to happen is we either get in when we can somewhere, or rent at a high price for our lifetime. 

Just my guess at it from current landscape. I mean everything can change, we could get hit by a giant meteor, economies completely collapse (but likely there would be more pressing issues to worry about at that point), or something."

2021-06-16 11:31:30,wallstreetbets,My point is that the delinquency rate is already pretty low. Possibly even lower when you factor in what you said about when payments are actually due. But UWMC is reporting their delinquency rates in their earnings calls. It's well under 2%. I don't believe there will be mass foreclosures. Whatever happens will just be a good way to get some extra inventory into a hungry market.
2021-06-16 12:53:04,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been on forbearance since April 2020. I lost my business and owe almost 1mm to the gubment (SBA). And they’re gonna take my house, so I said why the fuck would I give them more equity? 

Anyway, I was supposed to start paying july 1. Bank called me yesterday saying I could get another 3 months forbearance, so obv I did. But even then, I don’t have to make any back payments, I can simply move the amount to the back end of the loan and continue paying my normal monthly mortgage payment. 

So I don’t think there will be this mass foreclosure boom like people are thinking. I know not all mortgages are this way but many will be."
2021-06-16 17:11:17,wallstreetbets,Explain what will happen when interest rates rise. How will people afford the same housing with a higher interest rate?
2021-06-16 17:01:05,wallstreetbets,what ended up happening?
2021-06-16 11:32:53,wallstreetbets,"You are forgetting that the forbearance makes it so delinquent payments aren’t reported against the persons credit. So even though 30% of homeowners are in forbearance, they aren’t reported as delinquent."
2021-06-16 12:54:32,wallstreetbets,I think it comes down to your lender and if they have the necessary capital set aside to cover your non payment. Some smaller shops or more exotic mortgages that couldn’t be sold to the government will be less forgiving.
2021-06-16 17:12:47,wallstreetbets,"We have precedent for that, look to the Reagan era in the 80s people just kept buying. Rates didn’t matter."
2021-06-16 19:13:11,wallstreetbets,Firstly I did do an inspection but the inspection company was recommended by the realtor who knew the house flipper I was buying from. They did a half ass inspection. There was a support wall that was taken out and the support was not built back correctly which made the ceiling start falling in on itself. The foundation was “repaired” by a nothing company that didn’t stand up to their warranty and so the whole house was sinking in on itself. I ended up selling it (only because this crazy market). I bought it for 178k in 2016.  It was valued at 250k when I ended up selling it for 179k a few months ago. They tried to flip it quick and it’s still sitting on the market.

This is truly one of the buying opportunities of your lifetime. We are in the 1st stage of a steel commodity supercycle, and steel companies are printing money at face-ripping records. The best part is that most of the market doesn't seem to have caught on yet, which means we are still early, which means you can still reserve yourself a seat on the rocket. 

People have been so romanced by tech over the last year, they forgot about commodities. I think electric vehicles are the future, but the roads and bridges that they drive on have to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is good ol' American manufacturing companies. And guess where the steel in those vehicles comes from? That's right, you primates - companies like CLF."

Eg look at the comments by Distinct_chef, the account was dormant for 4 months, shows up 5 days ago raving nonstop about CLF. Is this a bot account?

At time of this posting (1020am est) the OP has 324 up votes but like every single reddit award. Fishy as hell.."

2021-06-16 11:35:20,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty sure what happened was the Obama Stimulus Package.  The government signed a huge public work project to help get out of the recession and part of this program was a ""Buy American"" clause.  It meant all the steel used in these construction projects had to come from American manufacturers.  This drove up demand for American steel and kept the steel industry a float during that time.

If Biden's Infrastructure Plan has a similar clause that requires American steel, we could be looking at similar numbers."
2021-06-16 08:04:13,wallstreetbets,AK steel I remember that
2021-06-16 09:18:08,wallstreetbets,They had international iron ore mines in Australia as well as having their hands in coal at that point. Both ventures went poorly causing them to focus on their core assets in the iron fields of Minnesota and the UP.
2021-06-16 17:59:35,wallstreetbets,"I think you should, but really that's up to your confidence level. It's positioned well, but if there was certainty, it would already be priced in.

I have 45 shares at $22.60 and am strongly considering borrowing against my extra paycheck next month to invest more. I'll be pissed if I lose it, but it won't ruin me. 

I suggest finding the upper limit if what you can afford to lose and spreading that between CLF and SENS. 

But I also lost like 75% on GameStop so you should take my opinion with a grain of salt."
2021-06-16 08:55:47,wallstreetbets,"Do yourself a big favor and stop watching and jump in. Tune out the noise, buy the dips and believe. You can thank me later."

2021-06-16 13:03:23,wallstreetbets,"Take it from me, dont do weeklies on CLF this stock destroys those. Agree with the shares and LEAPs as others have suggested above or maybe just some longer calls."
2021-06-16 15:58:13,wallstreetbets,"This. I don’t see many people mentioning $TX but all steel stocks are up 50%+ in past 3-5 months... TX hasn’t ran, been consolidating this entire time and is now at a 3 month low. Doubles my position in Tx this morning. LFG!!"
2021-06-16 16:39:19,wallstreetbets,I adore CLF. Probably the best stock at the best time. X - US STEEL is good too.
2021-06-16 11:22:47,wallstreetbets,I use my free awards on steel stock posts because I believe in them and have 90% of my portfolio in them. I'm sure people do the same with AMC and GME.

2021-06-16 14:51:04,wallstreetbets,Not everyone betting on CLF is a shill. It’s literally the most stable ticker on all of wsb with a bull thesis that is extremely tangible for the average person. Anyone someone uses the word sus though I just assume they are 14 years old.
2021-06-16 13:24:59,wallstreetbets,bot accounts don't go dormant lol

2021-06-16 08:16:51,wallstreetbets,They’ve already started releasing copper and other reserves to stabilize prices
2021-06-16 16:40:19,wallstreetbets,They can’t even export a football with the shipping problem and you’re telling me they are dumping steel soon. Hahah okay 👍🏻
2021-06-16 09:30:50,wallstreetbets,"Most of the shorting is probably just a hedge. 

Hedging against a drop in commodity pricing. 

It may turn into a small squeeze if it just continues to run higher. But generally the shorts don’t care about losing money on it because it’s all about the downside protection. They aren’t betting it goes down. They are just protecting their other holdings in case certain economic events transpire."

The US and EU have tariffs on Chinese steel, China has also reduced export rebates and is considering export taxes to artificially push down the price of domestic steel, which will keep the international price high.

Steel is a finished product so it’ll be last to see a relief in prices, but it will feel them at some point.

The reserves will be released to non-ferrous metal processing and manufacturing companies via a public bidding process, the government agency said.""

Non-ferrous is shit without iron in it. CLF produces iron ore and rolled steel. Steel is iron and carbon. This has literally nothing to do with steel prices. Stop being obstinate and learn some 6th grade Earth science.

2021-06-16 12:22:34,wallstreetbets,"Price history means... ???

What were steel prices then, what did CLF produce then, was CLF a vertically integrated steel producer then?

Were steel prices this high at the time? Was CLFs P/E ratio 4-5 at the time?

Sure keep pumping 100x p/e ratio stocks."
2021-06-16 09:27:08,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I’m wrong, but I didn’t think the steel prices were high because of the cost of the inputs. But rather, steel is high because of the demand for the finished steel product. 

ie you’re going bottom up and the demand is top down. The chain flows the opposite way then you are describing. At least while demand for finished steel product remains high. Steel demand drops, ore prices etc drop. 

Releasing reserves will help to increase available supply, assuming there is unused capacity. The increased supply will help prices come down. But it’s still not because the price of the inputs. It’s because demand is more readily met so pricing pressures and pricing power is reduced."
2021-06-16 10:01:59,wallstreetbets,"I like opposing points of view because it makes the investment thesis stronger, but I think you missed the point of the China metals announcement. It specifically excludes steel and iron, and govt. action there has been bullish for Western steel prices."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GOEV popped up yesterday 17% , so whats happend The electric-vehicle start-up Canoo (GOEV) shares rallied 16.8% after closing at $11.05 on June 15.

Canoo, which made its Nasdaq debut on December 22, 2020 and is still in the nascent stages of development, has not yet commenced production and sale of products. The company plans to launch its first lifestyle vehicle in late 2022, following it up with a delivery vehicle in 2023 and a sports vehicle in 2025.

However, the company is making all efforts to gain a toehold in this fiercely competitive EV industry. With a market capital of $2.62 billion, GOEV has gained 46.4% in the past month, but has lost 44.5% over the past six months. (See Canoo stock analysis on TipRanks)

The suggestion made by a user yesterday in Reddit's Wallstreetbets forum that Canoo could be considered as both a short and long term ""tremendous play,"" is expected to have caused the stock to spike to unusual highs."
2021-06-16 09:16:11,wallstreetbets,Reddit can't be that coordinated. Someone in r/canoo mentioned that it's more of an institutionnal buy because of the sheer volume spike in very less time frame.
2021-06-16 10:06:17,wallstreetbets,"Love GOEV, but Reddit definitely did not cause the spike. We aren’t that coordinated plus there are way too many stocks dividing everyone’s attention here."

Not only that, but there are quite a bit of calls that are ATM / ITM. If we see a quick move above $12 (and hold there), I think this would further increase buying pressure. Consequently, it could force some shorts to cover, which can spark an epic squeeze.  


Of course, there needs to be a lot of demand and volume for this to happen. So we'll see what happens. I'm long calls in GOEV."
2021-06-16 13:12:14,wallstreetbets,"Everyone saying Reddit is not coordinated—-there are  discords dedicated to dumping DD on WSB to get pumps going. I know this, because I’m a member in 3 said discord groups. 

No, WSB doesn’t have the power to make stock move on its own. But take members of—oh I don’t know, Atlas Trading?—pumping the stock *plus* WSB apes piling in, and you have a gamma squeeze that day traders can scalp the heck out of. 

So. Yes. GOEV was building momentum and then WSB pushed it over the edge because people literally have ticker screeners for WSB mentions, and they pile in those stocks that get mentioned/liked the most."

It’s clearly a sign of support / solidarity (and not profit motive) for the chodes among us who YOLOd our life savings to rescue DoKNGy. 

Here are the facts (that in no way serve as investment advice):

1.) Hindenburg Research published a hit piece targeting DoKNGy with unsubstantiated claims AFTER taking a considerable short position. 

2.) DoKNGy remains - fundamentally - the sector’s leader, and is often considered by impartial analysts as one of only a handful of value-driven blue chips in sector. 

3.) Apart from DoKNGy -  Hindenburg Research has a history of unsubstantiated attacks - but have only taken positions where they feel insulated from retail backlash e.g. Camath and Clover. In other words, they think DoKNGy will left to die. 

Weather permitting - and sign or not - I will stand with Mom. DoKNGy will not go alone."

Set a price target for both losses and gains that you will automatically sell at. For me I usually sell at -15%. However this rule can be broken if the drop is due to some bad media or something else stupid. As long as the companies fundamentals and my reasons for investing haven’t changed then I will hold. For selling same thing, +15%. This is a general baseline. Depending on what my goals are for the stock this can change. This 15% is usually only my stocks I plan on holding for a short amount of time. This rule is different for something like my amc I’m holding still that I bought at 9$ and is showing massive gains but I am holding for the potential squeeze. Or in my retirement savings account I have a high yield stock that has netted me 40% but I am holding it for the long haul because it has a high yield monthly dividend payout. 

All this is to say, set realistic goals for every stock you buy. Know why you are buying and what you expect out of it."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Detailed DD of Corsair [Bullish] # What is Corsair?

Corsair is a gaming company which has recently gained a lot of popularity because of Wallstreetbets and rightfully so, in my opinion. They sell computer peripherals, gaming and studio accessories, custom-made PCs, components, services and so on, effectively offering customers a one-stop shop for anything related to computer hardware, gaming software and other computer services. The company believes that they can address a market size of up to $46B or about 24 times larger than their current market share of $1.9B and they are expanding rapidly to make this happen. Over the last 12 months, Corsair acquired 3 new companies and launched 84 new products while showing a 47% growth in revenue in the latest quarter as compared to last year, 104% growth in gross profit and a staggering 197% growth in adjusted EBITDA! So, how are they achieving this massive growth? Essentially, Corsair is trying to tap two of the fastest growing markets right now, gaming and eSports, plus digital content creation which can be seen in their two main revenue streams: Gaming Component and Systems, and Gamer and Creator Peripherals which were split relatively evenly last quarter in terms of sales. 

Corsair is using the growth in the eSports market which is estimated to grow 11% annually over the next 5 years to kickstart their own growth. If you think about it, all of those millennials that grew up playing games are now able to afford specialised gaming gear which is what Corsair is offering. We're also seeing a big number of Generation Z entering the labour market and being able to afford more expensive gaming gear. Gaming and esports have already become mainstream with professional gamers earning serious cash and rivalling mainstream sport athletes in earnings so we can tell that this is just the beginning of it.

The digital content creation market is also growing at an annual rate of 13% across the board. YouTube, Twitch and other video, streaming and podcasting platforms are experiencing a massive surge in both creators and users. Corsair wants to use to this to drive their sales using their Creator Peripherals products. Working from home has also led a lot of people to improve their home offices and that trend is here to stay, which provides even more opportunities for Corsair to tap into yet another growing market.

Finally, the company wants to convert existing customers into loyal customers that come back to buy again and again and again. To do that, they are driving engagement through social media and they currently have a combined following of over 20mln across 4 different social media websites, plus they are represented by over 800 different influencers with a reach of over 1.3B people! They also offer customisation and personalisation in their products, they are focusing to be the best-in-class hardware and on selling solutions, services and software that will cater to the needs of gamers and creators.  Customer retention is always a winning strategy for companies when it comes down to optimising earnings and it is good to see that Corsair is focusing on it although I would also like them to start sharing some KPIs that track this. 

# Bullish Thesis

Before I go into my bullish thesis, I want to point out that the current stock price that I am looking at is $36. Alright, so, the company doesn't really have any strong rivals in my opinion which is a strong bullish argument. There is Pegatron, but the company has suffered a lot over the last year due to labor violations. Another is Razer, but they haven't shown a lot of promise over the last year either. The closest rival is probably Logitech, but their business model and strategy are much different than Corsair's and I think that Corsair has a much better positioning to tap into the growing markets. Still, both Logitech and Corsair have performed amazingly over the last 12 months although I see Corsair as having a much better potential for growth. Right now, it is only a seventh of the size of Logitech with a $3.3B market cap versus Logitech's $21.7B although Corsair's revenue is less than 3 times smaller than Logitech's with a $1.9B vs $5.2B in revenue. Their Price-to-Sales ratio is 1.74 for Corsair and 4.14 for Logitech so we can see that Corsair is actually undervalued in terms of sales. The main reason why Corsair is lagging behind is their net income which is still relatively low, but as I mentioned earlier in this video, their growth is supercharged and off the charts. Plus, this is completely understandable for a company that is in its early growth phase. Another bullish argument is the fact that a lot of hedge funds and institutions are betting AGAINST Corsair which gives us the opportunity for a short squeeze! About 18% of Corsair's share float is shorted, which is extremely high and completely unjustified in my opinion! The company is performing extremely well and they are trading at a low price. Their forward PE is only 17.9 which is tiny for a growth company as opposed to Logitech's forward PE of 27! Plus, Corsair absolutely CRUSHED their latest earnings, beating earnings per share by $0.25 or about 75%. They also beat their revenue estimate by $76M or almost 17% AND, to top it all of, they raised their guidance, but the price still dropped! Analysts keep revising their earnings estimates up, which is yet another bullish signal. Plus, Corsair has enough current assets to cover their current liabilities and has a low debt so financial health is not really a problem. They have one Venture Capital fund, EagleTree Capital, hold 62% of the company and insiders hold another 4% which gives us a massive, absolutely massive opportunity for price growth especially when we look at their tiny market cap! I honestly think that Corsair can easily double in price and still be a relatively good purchase. The company is that good. Finbox's DCF model currently gives us a 43% upside with a target price of $51.5 and SimplyWallstreet's DCF model gives us a fair value of $80.3, a 123% upside so we can see that there are some decent bullish arguments behind Corsair. However you look at it, Corsair is a beast of a company and an absolute bargain. 

There is no point in technical analysis right now. WSB boosted the stock and distorted all the signals. The only thing that's worth looking at is the 50D MA which is currently around $32-$33 and whether it will act as support for the current price. We can reasonably expect $40-$42 to serve as a resistance at this point.

# Final thoughts

Honestly, out of all the companies that I've been researching recently, this one looks the most promising. Corsair is one of my biggest holdings right now and I will just keep adding to it."

Stop posting shit like oh the PE ratio is low, gaming market is growing, it's a gud company guys. 

You're not some Michael Burry who just found an extremely undervalued position that nobody is aware of. We all know what CRSR is and what it does. It's just that for the time being and for the foreseeable future, the stock is going to trade flat or start going down because you have a billion-dollar PE firm offloading its bags on a low volume, borderline small cap stock."

I am pro CRSR long term though, and I have shares, but this is 100% based on their customer service and sentiment, they are the Chewy of gaming IMO."

Are you ready to CLNE house on the markets today?"
2021-06-16 09:32:42,wallstreetbets,"About the gamma squeeze on CLNE:

In order for it to happen on Friday the price must be over $13 but also the MMs would have had to sold *naked* calls. I don't think that is the case, the MM buys the stock as soon as you buy calls, the amount of stock they buy depends on the price of stock from the target price and also expiring date. I am sure they have algos that calculate how much of stock they need to buy depending on the variables. And this should create a feedback loop - gamma squeeze.

So the gamma squeeze should look as a constant slow rise (TSLA) instead of the boom (GME) we had when the short squeeze happens. 

Also, when mentioning GME we had people here saying the gamma squeeze will happen if the stock finishes above $300 on that Friday, Jan 29th. Well it did, it finished on $325 that Friday and guess what, it opened $275 next Monday. I got burned that day.

Nevertheless I hold 1,500 of CLNE and will continue to hold, my price target is above $20. And now I will look at the price at open."

Do what you'd like, but I'm not selling my calls, no matter how much the theta kicks us in the balls. Literally like 10 million dollars have been paid for options expiring on Friday, and the open interest just keeps growing. I don't think that kind of money isn't going to make any effort to move the price up and trigger the options chain."

2021-06-16 11:16:15,wallstreetbets,CLNE popular ticket but I’m down over 90% on my calls
2021-06-16 11:16:59,wallstreetbets,"I'm trying to buy CLNE right now, but I'm getting a message saying ""We can't place your order.  Order could not be sent to the venue (APIA000).""

Estimated max shares available for purchase is 237.  Can anyone here tell me why this is happening?  Thanks!"
2021-06-16 11:47:34,wallstreetbets,"I go to one fucking work meeting this morning and y’all fuck my stock like this? Who did this to CLNE you bastards? (PS as always is my opinion, it’ll be fine not concerned, but someone here owes me money)"

2021-06-16 09:57:18,wallstreetbets,I’m in on DKNG. I’m tired of millionaires shorting and praying on the little guy. Shorting should be illegal. Stand together degenerates.
2021-06-16 09:59:47,wallstreetbets,I guess I have to bag hold CLNE for another 6 months like I did with BB just to get close to break even. Mother fuck.

2021-06-16 10:36:54,wallstreetbets,"Love that there’s a play with a literal date (6/18) for CLNE, yet people don’t want to get behind it for some reason. People gonna bring CLOV to 30 but can’t bring CLNE to 13?"
2021-06-16 10:37:10,wallstreetbets,I'm an ape who likes cow farts. I will buy this CLNE dip and HODL!

2021-06-16 06:31:47,wallstreetbets,So I have 10k in CLNE in shares (11.4$ cost) and want to put another 10k to it. But I don’t want to buy it later if the price already moons and I don’t want to buy it now if we might have a big drill cause then I wont be able to DCA :/
2021-06-16 07:40:22,wallstreetbets,CLNE BTD!!!
2021-06-16 07:46:07,wallstreetbets,Transferred another $1500 into my account to load up on either more CLNE or buy back into CLOV depending how the market goes this morning. Will probably hold off until after JPOW speaks though.
2021-06-16 09:48:41,wallstreetbets,There’s zero reason CLNE should be going down. There’s been nothing but positive news and it’s a big wsb play. Those of you who think the market can’t be manipulated by the whales take note.
2021-06-16 10:17:42,wallstreetbets,"BUY THAT BB AND CLNE DIP, QUIT SELLING"
2021-06-16 10:43:30,wallstreetbets,Buy and hold CLNE.

2021-06-16 11:28:02,wallstreetbets,CLNE is not a short squeeze story... It’s a value play. How can you put it in the same sentences as AMC and GME...?

But CLNE is better than that. 1000% better. Not only does CLNE have hype, it has ACTUAL good business motto and it’s a meme stock for (one of) the first time ever to be #1 like GME was! 

-Clean energy! 

-RENEWABLE energy!!

-PROFITABLE ENERGY!!!

-LEADER in RNG fuels! THE cleanest fuel on the PLANET! 

-Partnership with AMZN!!!

-50+ Clean Energy gas stations have ALREADY been rolled out NATIONWIDE in preparation of AMZNs EV fleet! 

-AMZN invested over $2 BILLION (yes, with a B) in carbon reduction to fight climate change! (And who else to do that with but the leader in clean fuels!? CLNE!!!) Edit: THEY EVEN MADE A COMMERCIAL ABOUT IT! 😏

-AMZNs promise to have world wide EV transports by 2030!!!

This is 100% one of the best long term holds I’ve EVER seen! 

-Investing in CLEAN and GREEN! 🌎

-Investing in the planet that’s PROFITABLE! 📈💵

2021-06-16 12:35:48,wallstreetbets,Wsb might have gotten played.  How many of these tickers are the HFs long on?  They ran up to help pay to cover other shorts.  We are simple and they may have taken advantage of us.
2021-06-16 06:10:11,wallstreetbets,No love  for CLOV? It's only the second most shorted stock.

This time last year just before AGM, we were sitting around $4.50-5 and shareholders were pissed and ready to hang JC, except one..Prem Watsa who has been sitting on the BOD before JC, and who brought in JC to run BB after he failed to take BB private @$9. For the 3rd time PW renewed his convertible debentures but this time @$6 (was @$10 before) and dropped the interest rate from 3.75% t0 1.75% (was 6% first time). The ""Warren Buffett of Canada"" has seen BB longer than anyone here and he has more than doubled up his stake since this time last year. He now has just over 102m shares to his name. The obvious clue was when he tried to get more shares than he was allowed to and had to scale back to within the limit. ""Be greedy when others are fearful"" was one of Warren Buffett's wisdom. Our  Canada WB practiced that trick here. So don't just recite the phrase, act on it! 
My best move after that episode was buying @$6 leaps right after the debentures news. UP!"

2021-06-16 06:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Hi there, I recently came across a article about the current health of the economy. It got me thinking. All the big investment firms and some banks that has been shorting excessively with naked shorting and just shorting in general, especially the companies that retail investors are heavily invested in, what happens when they eventually have to cover all their short position. Just a short squeeze may just happen, but it results in the firms paying a lot of money. What If instead of paying up they declare bankruptcy. It happened before In 2008. Could it happen again? If this firms start selling off everything, wouldn't it cause a crash. What will happen to retail investors? Asking for a friend:)"

2021-06-16 08:01:34,wallstreetbets,"Did I miss a meme stock? Stocktwits is talking about $CPE. 

$CPE is a small cap oil energy company, and it's got 21% short interest, but it keeps going up, and shoots up whenever there's good buying volume. The stock is well rated to continue to grow because the company itself is outperforming, its earnings keep getting revised up, and it's going to be added to the Russell 3000 at the end of June. It's appearing in articles as a small cap energy stock to invest in. It seems obvious to me that the shorts can't actually win because it's a growing company & its buying volume will continue to step up, especially when it's added to the Russell 3000 and some index funds start buying it. With 21% short interest, it seems as if that's pretty good insurance against an energy stocks correction, since the stock can't stay down for long so long as the shorts haven't covered. 

I'm wondering whether I missed a meme stock (like CLF) or if it's a natural over-shorted stock in the wild, how to factor in the impact of 21% short interest on a stock's outlook."

2021-06-16 06:37:17,wallstreetbets,Buy increments over the course of the day? You don’t have to go all in at once
2021-06-16 06:36:12,wallstreetbets,"In these situations it's best to buy in increments. Just start buying, then if it moons before you're fully invested, you still averaged down, but if it drills you can keep lowering that average. Buy 2k at open, 2k at 11, 2k at 10.90, 2k at 10.80, etc. I really don't think it could drop more than a dollar without bad news, so this is still a great price."
2021-06-16 06:52:43,wallstreetbets,Buy 5k and save the rest for the imminent dips to average down

2021-06-16 17:55:54,wallstreetbets,why?
2021-06-16 17:58:58,wallstreetbets,Hope so! It depends if the ATM will spit out money.
2021-06-16 11:46:23,wallstreetbets,I have a couple clean energy stocks and my oil stocks have outperformed them like wtf...
2021-06-16 13:36:41,wallstreetbets,I bought 50 k at $66 ;)
2021-06-16 08:35:29,wallstreetbets,It will keep going down until I sell then it will go up.
2021-06-16 11:04:54,wallstreetbets,"Yea, go buy AMC at 60. What could possibly go wrong?"
2021-06-16 15:07:14,wallstreetbets,DIAMOND UDDERS 🐄💎
2021-06-16 11:38:01,wallstreetbets,BB on sale right now* fixed that for you.
2021-06-16 11:43:17,wallstreetbets,"And I literally thought of it when i put all money in it

Either I buy nice home or I live on streets 

But I made the decision before so no red day or fud bothers me anymore"
2021-06-16 13:12:43,wallstreetbets,CLNE should melt up pending good news from the FED.
2021-06-16 10:06:09,wallstreetbets,A lot of people are playing the 6/18 gamma squeeze though. I’m not here to be a long term investor. I’m here to throw money on black
2021-06-16 08:40:04,wallstreetbets,CLNE is now in a deal with Amazon. DKNG needs nation wide legalized sports gambling before moon
2021-06-16 08:39:37,wallstreetbets,DKNG cuz its ticker looks like Donkey Kong
2021-06-16 08:43:04,wallstreetbets,DKNG because of the sweet discount and the opportunity to kill Hindenburg
2021-06-16 10:46:01,wallstreetbets,Well you could take today as an opportunity to average down…
2021-06-16 10:42:54,wallstreetbets,That day fucked me hard. It hanst recovered since. You bought pretty high and it will take a month or so to see a profit. I doubt we make it back to 12 this week. Just hold.
2021-06-16 17:11:21,wallstreetbets,Why not? The SP is now based on supply and demand rather than underlying fundamentals. It’s no different than gold or Bitcoin.
2021-06-16 19:40:07,wallstreetbets,I want it to go up
2021-06-16 18:42:38,wallstreetbets,CLNE is solid long term. I would hold it this week at minimum and see what she does. BB is also a good long term play. IMO. CLNE will see more action then BB this week. Both are good
2021-06-16 08:57:23,wallstreetbets,Fuxk that bald headed idiot-
2021-06-16 09:42:52,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service
2021-06-16 06:56:18,wallstreetbets,"Technically it looks pretty bleak, but then again our last 5 green PMs didn't amount to anything, so I wouldn't sweat it too much.

CLNE at least has the advantage of having a target ""date"" to moon (and a very near one at that), so it's looking like a very good candidate for anybody on WSB looking to dump some money into a ticker. Diamond hands on those calls, don't let the theta break you."
2021-06-16 06:54:31,wallstreetbets,I would suck you off if CLNE hit 12 today
2021-06-16 10:13:40,wallstreetbets,"Bagholder spotted.

2021-06-16 10:56:22,wallstreetbets,You can just write ‘retard’ in your passport with a sharpie
2021-06-16 12:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Oh well. Still a sale. Wasn’t in it for the squeeze, would be nice, but not necessary. 

And we can always hope some vindictive whale buys a ton AH to set of the squeeze and fuck with the hedgies."
2021-06-16 08:23:38,wallstreetbets,"I'd wait for soooome form of spike to sell if you're going to. If it opens red they'll literally drop like 30% right off the bat, but they'll be up like 100% if it spikes even 50 cents. The value is literally almost entirely IV, and you need to use it when you exit."
2021-06-16 08:49:13,wallstreetbets,"I like the stock market better than sports betting because unlike with sports betting, I probably won't lose all my money, just most of it"
2021-06-16 14:28:03,wallstreetbets,Atta boy
2021-06-16 09:05:57,wallstreetbets,People are spooked over the FeD’s decision today. Premarket everywhere is reflecting that. I’m not worried 1 bit. I’m buying the opening dips especially on CLNE
2021-06-16 07:35:20,wallstreetbets,TO 1000!
2021-06-16 14:34:30,wallstreetbets,I bet my left nut it doesn't break $12 by friday

2021-06-16 14:36:38,wallstreetbets,Pump it real good
2021-06-16 15:50:05,wallstreetbets,"Nobody said 6/18 calls, they said buy shares so the existing calls cover. Maybe your mom was to much of a hoe to take you to school😉"
2021-06-16 11:21:27,wallstreetbets,YESSSSS
2021-06-16 17:17:01,wallstreetbets,"If she trends up early tomorrow, she will gain volume throughout the day. A strong finish tomorrow means bigger volume Friday morning."
2021-06-16 07:06:37,wallstreetbets,DKNG!!
2021-06-16 11:32:43,wallstreetbets,because they want to scare us and they are desperate
2021-06-16 11:30:43,wallstreetbets,"Some big players looking for the cheapest entry point, my guess."
2021-06-16 11:30:50,wallstreetbets,Shares so doesn’t matter to me
2021-06-16 12:32:20,wallstreetbets,Or shut the fuck up and say nothing.   I’m tired of Yellen opening her fucking mouth.  We don’t need your opinion just facts.
2021-06-16 15:08:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I think we will have a great weekend 😉"
2021-06-16 13:56:15,wallstreetbets,Big money sharpened their pencils to fill out buy orders. Strap in
2021-06-16 14:48:08,wallstreetbets,True. Rather buy stocks than get my .10%
2021-06-16 15:45:47,wallstreetbets,3 most mentioned tickers
2021-06-16 16:07:29,wallstreetbets,"I ge you, I'm rolling over my profits into more ETFs once this is over a month from now, this is an annoying scam"

2021-06-16 11:53:40,wallstreetbets,"Ummm, I’m balls deep in CLNE but now it didn’t hit $11.50 today. Are you looking at a chart from last week or something or are you just retarted?"
2021-06-16 11:52:25,wallstreetbets,We are moving now!
2021-06-16 13:51:10,wallstreetbets,In line at the soup kitchen.

2021-06-16 12:28:49,wallstreetbets,yeah totally you are good dude you won't lose 90%
2021-06-16 08:35:30,wallstreetbets,I’m all in on BB. Patience is key
2021-06-16 09:13:16,wallstreetbets,"Not only that, but they’re getting into the content game as a non-traditional partner in that space. They know where sports media is trending: gambling. And the major media partners don’t have the balls to go full-on degen to cater to that audience. They’re building the infrastructure for when sports betting is legal nationwide 

Also ape 🦍like banana 🍌 something something"
2021-06-16 09:12:48,wallstreetbets,"yes, and with that revenue they can invest in other products. turn a gambling app into an empire"
2021-06-16 18:06:37,wallstreetbets,Uh oh. I'm afraid to look
2021-06-16 09:46:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, loading up on sterile eye drops"
2021-06-16 09:49:14,wallstreetbets,I would imagine that position was covered shortly after the report dropped.
2021-06-16 13:31:49,wallstreetbets,He’s trying to be liked by WSB

2021-06-16 11:02:39,wallstreetbets,this
2021-06-16 11:03:45,wallstreetbets,We’re not selling for GME or AMC. We are sticking with Clean Energy Fuels Corp

2021-06-16 15:13:12,wallstreetbets,Been holding long and strong with them!

2021-06-16 09:23:43,wallstreetbets,Yeah well fuck you that’s not what they said last week when everyone was buying 6/18
2021-06-16 09:27:47,wallstreetbets,LMAO at your puts
2021-06-16 09:30:42,wallstreetbets,"I keep telling people that selling options is the way. Nobody listens, they just blabber on about Qanon investing conspiracies."
2021-06-16 11:16:43,wallstreetbets,🌕🐄💨💨💨CLNE is the way
2021-06-16 11:38:50,wallstreetbets,"AMC may look red the next few, but rest assured it's going up way farther than the TV box screams it will."
2021-06-16 11:44:03,wallstreetbets,Add Clov to that batch I keep adding AMC and CLOV too!
2021-06-16 11:04:25,wallstreetbets,"Why did you sell at a loss? Go with CLNE, hard to see that losing. Pretty close to the floor too!!"
2021-06-16 11:02:42,wallstreetbets,"I have bb too, so disappointed"
2021-06-16 11:04:53,wallstreetbets,Sorry to hear that man. Take what you have and don’t look back. Next time if you come back to stocks just invest in slow growth companies and not hyped up ones because once they get hyped up the news is already old. Check out r/investing and r/stocks . They’re more friendly there and helpful.
2021-06-16 11:04:36,wallstreetbets,Put it all in CLNE and hold for long term.  You can thank me later.  I’m 4K shares and 43 contracts deep.
2021-06-16 12:19:56,wallstreetbets,your lack of faith is disturbing..
2021-06-16 12:13:10,wallstreetbets,Safer to get share.

2021-06-16 12:59:31,wallstreetbets,Right there with you. Even worse on CLNE.
2021-06-16 11:08:14,wallstreetbets,"It won't be a short term play, but once there is a catalyst there should be a lot of movement."
2021-06-16 11:57:58,wallstreetbets,"Facts, load and hold"
2021-06-16 10:15:42,wallstreetbets,"BB is continuously pulling back to 14-15 range, I have been buying when it dips below and selling when it goes above, it’s been consistent."

2021-06-16 14:57:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man, you went to the moon and back. It was a 1 day trip. Sorry you slept though it. CLNE train💪🏻💪🏻"
2021-06-16 14:59:04,wallstreetbets,Lol you don't even know what the moon is. Next time learn to take profit instead of bagholding.
2021-06-16 14:55:57,wallstreetbets,I think you were at the moon
2021-06-16 15:08:13,wallstreetbets,It will move when you -90%😃😃😃

2021-06-16 10:56:09,wallstreetbets,"Don't do that! There's so many people that lost everything, kept going and pulled through. It sucks. It really fucking sucks. But just keep moving forward. My contingency plan is if everything goes to shit I'll just be a hitchhiking bum who camps and hops trains and just lives free, hopefully catching a job here or there for pocket money and keep moving, to see how far I can go. You can still make something of your life. Keep your head up buddy!"
2021-06-16 10:54:51,wallstreetbets,"Hey, hugs buddy. It sucks but it’s only money. Your life is worth more than a few bad calls in an unfair market."
2021-06-16 10:56:20,wallstreetbets,"That’s why the stock market is something you can’t play with. I hope you are seriously joking. I lost a hugeeeee sum of money in my early trading days and fought through it, taking your life over money AINT worth it. PM me if you want to talk stay positive."
2021-06-16 10:54:54,wallstreetbets,It’s just stonks. It’ll be ok man. Sell what you’re holding if you’re that worried.
2021-06-16 10:55:42,wallstreetbets,Living another day is always a win brother!
2021-06-16 10:56:45,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you need to find someone to talk to. It's all temporary, and I'm sure you have a long list of other losses you've overcome so far (in this casino or not). Don't let it beat you!"
2021-06-16 10:55:40,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, random stranger here. Please don't do that. Just give it time. I'm about to jump onboard so if it fails, we can fail together. Just don't do that please bro"

Also, even if it doesn't, money is just an object and life is worth living regardless of how much you do or don't have. Consider that the gift of life is life itself, not the materials you gather while you're living. Don't cut it short friend, there's always a new leaf to be turned."
2021-06-16 10:59:46,wallstreetbets,We need some support people here. I hope your okay buddy
2021-06-16 11:04:12,wallstreetbets,This is not the way buddy. You are already something. Stonks ain’t gonna change that. Apes falls but live to ride another day.
2021-06-16 11:08:07,wallstreetbets,"You can come back from this man. Don’t do anything rash. Don’t do it to yourself and don’t do it to your family and friends. Hope you’re joking but if not, please reach out to someone."

2021-06-16 10:57:04,wallstreetbets,If this isn't a joke and you'd like to talk please reach out. A bad call (no pun intended) isn't the end and financially you can come back.

Please think about the family or friends around you, and hell, if you have a dog or cat, think about them too. How will they survive without you?

There are plenty of ways you've already made something of yourself, don't take that away from those who know you. Why not ask them? I urge you to please talk to someone, anyone, right now. And, if no one's available, talk to that dog or cat. Get the words out of your head and into the universe.

2021-06-16 08:44:58,wallstreetbets,"That’s not always the case. Look at CLNE for example. This genuinely is a long term play, but has super strong short term potential. Green energy is the future. This is a safe bet even if she doesn’t squeeze as you will eventually make money no matter what. Risk/reward ratio is very low"

2021-06-16 11:18:43,wallstreetbets,I am buying as well
2021-06-16 10:08:59,wallstreetbets,"It’s not short , it’s a staged one to keep it under $60

So we are good 🦍💎🦍"
2021-06-16 13:40:11,wallstreetbets,loading up on calls brrrr
2021-06-16 14:27:22,wallstreetbets,I got out of BB this morning. Thinking AMC but thinking may be too late.
2021-06-16 14:25:15,wallstreetbets,"BB is just a long term investment, I’d expect it to stable out in the $11-$13 range for a few months then have another rise just like it did after last spike in January"

2021-06-16 19:54:22,wallstreetbets,What strike?
2021-06-16 06:43:33,wallstreetbets,GME is a good example. Most thought buying at 100 was too high. We are waiting for the squeeze. Should still go up before the squeeze then 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 once it happens
2021-06-16 07:14:10,wallstreetbets,I literally came here to see what stocks to avoid.
2021-06-16 06:58:53,wallstreetbets,The only tickers to survive its own thread has really been GME and AMC. Maybe BB. Everything else in here died soon after.
2021-06-16 08:57:00,wallstreetbets,In a good way
2021-06-16 10:54:29,wallstreetbets,You'll come out better if you just keep that 20 in your pocket.
2021-06-16 10:49:03,wallstreetbets,Keep your $20.
2021-06-16 14:38:10,wallstreetbets,Not sure man. I am down 50% still.

CLOV was a PnD unfortunately. I made some money then lost some on it as well.

CLNE is down 6% right now, but I truly see this going up by Friday and keep climbing more. That's my opinion and I'm holding 5500 shares if that means much."

2021-06-16 17:32:27,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't say forgot, people are holding, price is staying constant, If we had heaps 🧻 ✋ then we'd be plummeting. I think its more all the newbies that got in AMC got in around $5-$10 and after seeing the market fluctuations don't view $50 as a good buy in. Meanwhile people are learning to diversify their portfolios into other stocks they feel they'll get better margins from. I.e. CLNE

But I'm retarded so don't take my words as anything more than monke bang rock"

2021-06-16 11:34:00,wallstreetbets,I think the casino stuff and the shelf offering fucked the momentum last Friday. But now that hype's overwith it's definitely still possible.
2021-06-16 11:09:17,wallstreetbets,Yes. It went to mid 50s last year. A repeat seems plausible.

2021-06-16 12:28:37,wallstreetbets,"The DD on CLNE is like most of the DD around here now. Only the positives. 

What everyone fails to see is CLNE is a niche RNG supplier for transportation. No one seems to want to discuss how they plan to get all this RNG from landfills and dairy farms to the areas that can actually use it. These things generally arent near each other."
2021-06-16 12:25:30,wallstreetbets,If it gets anywhere near 9 I'm out. It just dips more each day this week

2021-06-16 18:10:42,wallstreetbets,"There are a frickton of options expiring in the money on Friday. There is a moronic belief that many of them will get executed causing the price to rise. Chances are though, it will rise on MONDAY not on Friday. Still, Friday is quad witching day, which last time for us, meant nothing, but this time, there are so many options it could be super violent in volatility. There will be massive short attacks to crush the price between tomorrow and Friday, but there will ALSO be apes with their paychecks fighting those short attacks to stay in the green going into Friday options expire time. An epic battle will be fought. We all knew that today was going to be a shiite day because of J-Pow making an appearance causing the market to drop. Also, wednesday is generally NOT a day people get paid. Most people get paid on Friday and buy on Monday. So really, here are my predictions for Friday and monday. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR and this is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I am making an educated guess here.

IF the retail investors can bust open the ATM machines tomorrow and Friday, and manage to dump billions of cash into the AMC market, it will counteract the HF's who attempt to short us and get the price over $55/$60. This will end VERY badly for the Hedges and Friday things could go boom. On the other hand, if Friday it doesn't go boom but we still are over $55/$60 from 3pm to 4pm (Robinhood expires at 3, Market at 4) then calls that are in the money get auto executed on MONDAY's day. Monday is also the day that the rules about shorting changes. I can't remember the rule, maybe that you can't short the same share the same day? I don't know. Anyway, IF we are over the $55/$60 mark going into the weekend, you can expect Monday to be super bullish. 

On the other side: If the retail investors can't scrape up enough casharoo to dump the next two days into AMC, well then we could potentially hit levels of resistance down to the $40 max pain point. Even though max pain is really like $29, there are so many options set at $40, that the general consensus is that the stock will move toward $40, as people close their options for 6/18 and buy new options for 7/2 and HF's sell off collateral shares causing a drop. This drop will scare more and more people holding potentially worthless options calls to try and sell theirs before expiry on Friday. Lastly, those that do expire in the money, if they don't have the money in their accounts, those options don't execute, rendering them worthless in many cases. 

So Friday and Monday could go boom if enough cash is poured in from new retail, apes, that chick at the donut shop, or the cop who saw my sign taped to my car. It could also go bust if the short attacks overwhelm our piggy banks, plus HF's trade somewhat illegally through dark pools driving the price down. So it's boom or bust, and we are hoping boom because that would mean that we could see a squeeze Friday or Monday. Again, not financial advice. Expect volatility. Last time we had witching day it was a complete dud."
2021-06-16 17:58:34,wallstreetbets,Look at the calls expiring Friday and how much money into it!

2021-06-16 11:25:35,wallstreetbets,Oh AMC is a pump and dump but all the random stocks that have been mentioned recently that don't even have half the short squeeze potential that AMC does isn't?
2021-06-16 14:27:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah last think I need to do is cash out negative and put into something that will crash even more
2021-06-16 14:26:10,wallstreetbets,But it spiked in January because of a meme stock! Are we really just waiting around for it to meme out again 😐

What does it mean that ""investors, insider and apes own 98%"" ?

Its not like any company has shares in the float that aren't owned by anyone.   If they aren't owned by institutional investors or insiders then they have to be owned by retail - you can't have any shares that are not owned so of course someone has to own them."

2021-06-16 12:34:11,wallstreetbets,Major share holder unwinding. It’s a stock that can be moved pretty easily on relatively low volume. I suspect it will rip once this sell pressure is gone. It’s a game of patience on this one. It will most likely hit $20+ but may take a couple months or more.

2021-06-16 06:32:06,wallstreetbets,I guess that's understandable but if you look at it retrospect AMC & gme are in there own league....but if you bought wish on Friday at 9.76 you would have had the same return as AMC with less risk because it was only 2$ away from it's yearly low AMC is is about 60$ away from it's yearly low

2021-06-16 18:11:49,wallstreetbets,Gamma squeeze happens when calls are cheap. How many folks on here are shilling for AMC so people keep buying calls at ridiculous prices. You have a much better chance of hitting a 10 bagger on calls that have a low IV than on a stock that has quadrupled in the last couple weeks.
2021-06-16 08:42:56,wallstreetbets,"Same, plus investing in cow farts can’t go Tits up"
2021-06-16 09:05:34,wallstreetbets,Best of luck!
2021-06-16 06:59:05,wallstreetbets,I didn’t have 20k in it until yesterday
2021-06-16 15:29:38,wallstreetbets,"Good deal, I’m holding 40,000 shares. Had to average up the last 2 weeks and spent this week averaging down. I’m sitting on an $10.87 avg. I don’t plan to sell for a few years unless we gamma. If so, I’ll cash out, wait for it to settle, then buy back in with house money for the long term"
2021-06-16 09:28:11,wallstreetbets,Ok idiot
2021-06-16 15:08:18,wallstreetbets,Gtfo of here with that shit. Stop assuming every  stock is the next gme based on some shit dd you read in the webull comment section.

2021-06-16 11:23:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the large 500 lot buy orders at the low and large sell orders at the top every day?

Those are not made by retail. Those are made by institutions riding up and down on this every day."
2021-06-16 11:25:34,wallstreetbets,It is odd I have to admit. I’ve chalked it up to retards thinking they are buying the dip but are actually buying the dump.
2021-06-16 11:28:02,wallstreetbets,"Almost all of them are.

But AMC? It's already at 30 bil market cap. GME for example is only 15 bil. 

It's insanely hard for us to push it up even more, considering short interest is only 13% of the float"

2021-06-16 11:44:56,wallstreetbets,Yup. Do they not understand that the ppl they're supposedly taking money from arent also selling them options at overinflated premiums? Lol its laughable at the amount of delusion
2021-06-16 16:11:03,wallstreetbets,"2 buy orders of 418,512 shares on the bid came out on the tape at exactly 4pm"
2021-06-16 11:03:17,wallstreetbets,"Okay, P&D isn't accurate.

GME squeeze in January was a legitimate shock event. Everything after that? Big players have been absolutely *murdering* people with insanely high IV, way OTM calls, and offloading their positions to retail at drastically inflated prices. 

Bagholding GME >$300? Guess who you gave that money too? Bought a 500c during a runup? Guess who ate your premium?

The cultlike conviction that those stocks will go above $1k/share (nevermind $100k+) is being used, and probably heavily encouraged by, large players to rake in cash. It's am absolutely classic use of the ""get rich quick"" scam to take sucker's money."
2021-06-16 11:00:27,wallstreetbets,"Imagine your surprise when you find out the convoluted DD about dark pool shorts, synthetic shares, and HeDgIeS being afraid **is** the scam."

2021-06-16 12:20:30,wallstreetbets,Since when? 1 week? Lol
2021-06-16 12:22:30,wallstreetbets,You might not be cut out for this type of stuff
2021-06-16 12:30:09,wallstreetbets,Total BS
2021-06-16 12:35:17,wallstreetbets,It's all the money have to play with. Friday will be a dud and the sell off will be epic. Maybe I'll get back in when it bounces around 6-8 a share for a while. Lers be real the pop off happened and lost its volume I see nothing bout a down slope for a month or 2.
2021-06-16 11:10:28,wallstreetbets,"I'm actually up 40% after buying at the top in January I averaged down a lot because I believe in the potential. I'm still on it and not selling because my investment thesis hasn't changed, but I don't see the potential for a squeeze."
2021-06-16 11:29:00,wallstreetbets,Curious what you’re invested in
2021-06-16 14:37:39,wallstreetbets,Id wait til Friday at the very least

2021-06-16 17:25:10,wallstreetbets,That might possibly be the play. I wouldn’t buy puts tho. I feel she is still charged up and could pop off Thursday and Friday
2021-06-16 19:34:05,wallstreetbets,"I am not a financial advisor, however over the past 5 weeks, we have seen dips beginning Wednesday and ending at Friday at 3pm. There are abnormalities like one Thursday we had a big green day, but generally speaking, Wed-Friday are not strong days for us. However I am going into surgery at 9:45 and won't be done til about 3:45 so chances are I will wind up losing $5,000 in options between tonight and Friday am when they expire worthless (assuming I don't die tomorrow of course) as if it goes to $62, I won't be there to roll them over into next week."

2021-06-16 14:59:32,wallstreetbets,Yep still holding 375 shares at an average of $14.20. I mean I couldn’t imagine if I sold my AMC when it hit $20 in January versus where it’s at now.
2021-06-16 11:26:22,wallstreetbets,Yea that’s what a guy told me when I bought 1000 shares of amc at 8
2021-06-16 11:36:01,wallstreetbets,"It's not insanely hard, it just all comes down to human psychology and how much people are willing to wait. Shorts have to cover these positions eventually and everything around regulations and co are starting to really work in our favour"

2021-06-16 11:46:32,wallstreetbets,"Man, they think reverse repo usage is hedge funds borrowing money to cover amc losses!  It is part delusion but also part predatory behavior against people that don't know any better."
2021-06-16 16:19:41,wallstreetbets,Awesome I’ve got 2k in or so.  I’ll take the confirmation bias.
2021-06-16 16:20:53,wallstreetbets,"Are you new to stocks? Every stock has a opening and closing auction where imbalances are settled and market on close orders are executed.

2021-06-16 12:37:47,wallstreetbets,"Man that is not smart. No way she goes that low. Not sure why you feel that way. I’ve spent month researching this company and following this ticker. No way she’s doing what you say. Cut your loses then, but you’ll be salty af when she trends upwards the next several days. Take it from someone who’s accumulated over 40,000 shares over time. Best of luck to you"
2021-06-16 11:12:02,wallstreetbets,It will gather momentum as a meme stock but also as a cyber security growth stock. Dangerous combo

2021-06-16 08:09:30,wallstreetbets,"Woah, I just looked at $ET. Are you kidding me? It's barely growing compared to $CPE and it doesn't have all the short sellers trapped in it like $CPE does.

2021-06-16 09:31:20,wallstreetbets,Lol. I’ll stick to my 40k worth of shares. Thx for the advice. Enjoy window licking
2021-06-16 11:34:54,wallstreetbets,"There’s a big difference between you at $8 and the guys that bought at $60+. 

Don’t be afraid to take some profits if you haven’t already. I rode gme from $40 to $400plus and didn’t sell until the low $100s. I wish I would have listened to the people telling us to take profits at the time."
2021-06-16 11:40:02,wallstreetbets,"What I meant was, when AMC was $10 and people had $1000, they could buy 100 shares.

At $50, they could only buy 20 shares with the same amount of money.

Harder to control the float, easier to sell and profit."
2021-06-16 11:47:18,wallstreetbets,Anyone who dives into this market because some jerk off on youtube tells them to deserves to go broke. Sorry not sorry

2021-06-16 12:42:23,wallstreetbets,Trust me I want you to be right but each day this week is just loss after loss. Such a great company and it just bleeds out gains each day. No upward pressure just sell sell sell
2021-06-16 11:14:05,wallstreetbets,"I think their security software is top notch, those fundamentals are still there and haven't really changed.

2021-06-16 17:28:42,wallstreetbets,We didn’t all say it would be good today. Many of us knew that today would be shit until the FED made a decision. I predicted we would melt upwards after that and I was right. I was hoping for more of a pop here in AH but it’s still early.

I can't cringe anymore than I already am."
2021-06-16 11:38:01,wallstreetbets,According to who ? The price could skyrocket next week and then that wouldn’t mean anything. I like the stock and I think it hasn’t even started yet.

2021-06-16 08:49:03,wallstreetbets,Both (I’m in for both) may be too quick of a play but Friday 6/18 $13cs is what everyone is raving about. Don’t listen to my smooth brain hit r/CLNE and poke around for your DD.

2021-06-16 16:00:48,wallstreetbets,No room to grow HA!! They reinvest in themselves. They are in the process of increasing infrastructure to completely go carbon neutral. Green renewable gas is the future. Stick to bootlegs then Fuctard

2021-06-16 16:29:24,wallstreetbets,"Stocks have two auctions, market open and market close. There are also order types called narket on close, limit on close, etc. When the market opens or closes, the auction is executed and shares trade hands in one big block like you saw there. For all you know, that could have been a bunch of market participants selling at the close so they dont carry any overnight risk. 

All stocks have the auction, dont try to think too far into it unlesa there is a trade imbalance at the auction, which can happen."

2021-06-16 12:57:06,wallstreetbets,I'm not trying to put you down or anything. Wish I had the capital to buy that many shares I'm jelly. I ran out of day trades last Wednesday and got clne way too high. It never came back and just bled out instead. It also being shorted sooooo easily is off putting.
2021-06-16 16:08:23,wallstreetbets,"Let me educate you so you have something to scratch your head over this evening. Renewable gas is better for fleet commercial vehicles like tractor trailers. Imagine how many batteries are needed to pull a full load of cargo. Now, most of those batteries end up taking up 8% of the load space in the back, refrigerated food, need even more batteries. Now, any profit making company knows that they can’t make money hauling half load, stopping every 3 hours to charge for the next 4 hours. That’s dumb money. There is a Diesel fuel conversion kit that installs on a truck for $250 which allows it to run off of renewable gas. Would you rather spend $250 to convert your existing fleet or would you rather spend $300,000 for each new truck you need to purchase? Even a retard can do the math. Buy CLNE and thank me later. Good luck to you"

3. On some vary rare days stock price will go up and I lock my profit at 30-40% and watch them go to 300-400%.
4. Some days they go up like 5-10% and then straight go back to negative and start to chill there for the rest of the day or week burning theta.

""After the Reddit-driven short squeeze in January, WallStreetBets users again turned their attention toward this cannabis stock. One Reddit user wrote in a post last week that Tilray ""is a movement,"" adding that the company has ""fantastic stats"" and is ""a worthy opponent to AMC"" as a meme stock. Per Quiver Quantitative, the cannabis stock was mentioned 922 times on WallStreetBets over the past five days. Shares of TLRY are up just 7.8% so far this month, suggesting that the stock rally is yet to start.

Investors should note that Tilray has emerged as the world's largest cannabis company following its blockbuster merger with Aphria in May. The Canadian cannabis producer has an estimated revenue growth rate of 49.9% and earnings per share growth rate of 84.3% for this fiscal year (ending May 2022). The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and a Growth Score of A"".

2021-06-16 08:51:44,wallstreetbets,"Rough couple of days but I think there are plenty of buying opportunities. 

HYLN is a screaming deal, but one you'll have to be patient with. 

Ford (F) shld be up significantly by Fall, and especially next year. Lots of enthusiasm for their 2022 vehicles. They're also making wise investments and partnerships that should pay off big. Like billions big.

For you wild ones, take a look at some high volatility stocks if you want a day to day rollercoaster like AMC or WOOF.  That's too ulcer-inducing for me, but you may feel exhilaration by contrast.

Also- UWMC feels primed for a bounce (despite getting shit on yesterday by thugs). Options are tricky here though- 50/50 either way. Def an ape-like decision. 🦍

Consolidated Edison (ED) is an energy stock, but one that has dividends too. Shld pop a little given the hot summer and high electricity usage. A bet would be to $90 by Sept. But even if you miff it, you can keep it on your portfolio for the divs. 

As always- good luck everyone! May your rockets stand tall and fire high into the sky! 🚀 🌙"
2021-06-16 09:01:56,wallstreetbets,The nice thing about having the majority of your portfolio in options is you get to pretend that you’re not losing money until 9:30 🤡
2021-06-16 09:27:09,wallstreetbets,It seems like a lot of people are not aware of the good news so here it is... if you buy a stock one day and it goes down the next it turns out you can still hold it longer instead of just taking losses all the time.

\-over 53% short ratio

\-low float and will move rapidly when it does

\-borrow rate just increased to 11% so it is costing the shorts more and more each day

\-likely a share of the Infrastructure trillions

\-some speculation about getting back in on the USPS contract that is being reviewed again

\-some speculation about WKHS drones being looked at by Amazon

There are many potential catalysts and at this short ratio, this thing will absolutely moon when she rides again. Time is on the side of those accumulating and HODL.

Not a better mega-squeeze opportunity out there. Not a flash in the pan pump and dump. A legit epic squeeze play."

2021-06-16 12:11:56,wallstreetbets,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - WKHS- Workhorse Group will file a legal challenge to the U.S. Postal Service decision in February to award a multibillion-dollar, 10-year contract to Oshkosh Defense to manufacture a new generation of postal delivery vehicles, a source told Reuters.

The contract, which could be worth more than $6 billion in total, allows for delivery of between 50,000 to 165,000 of the vehicles over 10 years that will be a mix of internal combustion-powered and battery-electric vehicles.

Workhorse had proposed building an all-electric vehicle fleet for USPS and has won the support of many U.S. lawmakers. USPS did not immediately comment. The bid protest will be filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims as early as Wednesday, the source said."

Short ladder attacks at the open to chase away the paper hands (which have worked decently by the way) are starting to fail and are coming at a cost and that cost just went up.  
  
This is where smart money starts to load WKHS. Stock was most shorted at 41% last week and shorts have doubled down driving it up to over 53% short now. But their strategy just got much more expensive and time is their enemy.  
  
So longs that continue to load and HODL have time very much on their side. Shorts up to over 53% and now paying 11% for borrowed shares are on the clock. Tick tock MFs. This powder keg will explode. I can keep loading and shorts assholes are starting to pucker. If the borrow rate continues to climb and longs HODL or add, shorts are going to get absolutely torched.

I like this stock. They are programmatically secure. If they make an app submission process and charge for more complicated apps, and less for things that can be easily understood and duplicated quickly, they could convert js to their os and thereby get a store wherein they aren't just randomly checking apps for security. Moreover, if they hired a Japanese port team to do it for small apps, you'd never know that not a line produced wasn't original code.

Moreover, if they release the classic with an updated os and a 4 core+ processor and price it as an LG competitor, they could be the king of the hill at any moment."

Last years Amazon partnership has yet to even really be factored in and they also have a big partnership with a huge Chinese auto maker.

Market Chatter: BlackBerry Blasted On Executive Pay as Reddit Rally Enriches CEO John Chen  
BY MT Newswires  
— 10:30 AM ET 06/15/2021  
10:30 AM EDT, 06/15/2021 (MT Newswires) -- An influential proxy advisory firm is blasting BlackBerry Ltd. ( BB   
Loading...  
Loading...  
) (BB.TO, BB) over its executive compensation practices, BNN Bloomberg is reporting Tuesday.  
In a scathing report ahead of the tech company's June 23 annual general meeting, Glass Lewis recommended investors vote against BlackBerry's executive pay plan, and said the company's compensation compared with overall corporate performance merits an ""F"" grade.  
At the core of the issue is BlackBerry's share-based compensation plan, the report said. Glass Lewis noted that the recent Reddit-fuelled rally in shares of the company could result in outsized share awards compared to the underlying fundamentals of the business.  
Glass Lewis said that the long-term incentives outlined in fiscal 2019, combined with the rally, could result in BlackBerry Chair and Chief Executive Officer John Chen receiving $106 million in performance share units (PSUs) and restricted share units (RSUs), along with a $90-million cash incentive.  
Tuesday's report noted the PSU performance hurdles -- ascending price targets between $16 and $20 per share on a volume-weighted average price basis -- have been easier to achieve during the current mania. Glass Lewis noted that three out of the five PSU tranches were achieved, unlocking three million PSUs.  
At the height of the frenzy, shares of BlackBerry peaked north of $30, though they have since slid to $17.  
In the report, Glass Lewis said that given the anomalous nature of the Reddit rally, it appeared those share awards were divorced from the fundamentals shown by the company prior to the frenzy.  
""Based on the company's share price performance over the past fiscal year -- prior to January 2021 the price hovered around $5 and peaked around $8.50 -- it appears to us that these tranches were earned as a result of the company's sudden share price increase concurrent with the retail trading phenomenon observed in January 2021, which was characterized by extremely volatile trading patterns of shares in certain publicly traded brands, most famously GameStop.""

2021-06-16 09:48:07,wallstreetbets,Better focus on BB before doing other stocks mate. Otherwise those capital is too diversified and at the end doesn't have buying power.
2021-06-16 10:23:26,wallstreetbets,There’s a real idiot for ya.
2021-06-16 09:44:56,wallstreetbets,Did you do stop lose?

2021-06-16 19:32:36,wallstreetbets,Exact same situation here haha
2021-06-16 12:59:22,wallstreetbets,Why would you ever want to pay off your mortgage? Go and open up a home-equity line of credit and dump it all into the stock market for literal free money.
2021-06-16 12:07:27,wallstreetbets,And my axe!
2021-06-16 12:55:36,wallstreetbets,"You need to buy a nicer home then. Come on bro. We've been writing mortgages at 2.5% for over a year now & you only have $140k leveraged? Pump those numbers up my dude.

&#x200B;

debt at 6% is a liability

debt at 2% is an asset"
2021-06-16 14:19:07,wallstreetbets,Itd pay all my debts.
2021-06-16 16:35:03,wallstreetbets,139k is like barely a down payment on a house now lol
2021-06-16 11:09:32,wallstreetbets,"All the pied piper bullshit pushed in by hedgies to spread out WSB wealth so they don't hit the main targets in order of GME, AMC, BB with near 100% of our meme investment power, that also coupled with overt simple minded greed because people are stupid and want to buy in at 2 dollars.

Worry not, brother. Buy the dip. BB is a great company doing great things, and the attention will wander back to BB hard once a whiff of their delicious farts hit the newspaper stands."
2021-06-16 12:07:24,wallstreetbets,BB has always been a long term play. Not sure why/who hyped so much but if you were here before January you'd know you should expect to hold BB for a year or three.
2021-06-16 12:16:08,wallstreetbets,"Got left behind? It literally hit 20 like a week ago? We don't want it part of the meme lot anyway, this is a company that's ahead of the market it aims to be in"
2021-06-16 15:33:19,wallstreetbets,"In for 1772 shares @ 12.65 as of a couple hours ago, band together brother"

2021-06-16 13:32:38,wallstreetbets,"Hey, me too! I own 800 shares now..."
2021-06-16 11:07:44,wallstreetbets,"Me too! Thankfully I was so nervous about this, and so poor, that I only put in $50"
2021-06-16 16:59:03,wallstreetbets,It's the BB way! Payoff will be sweet
2021-06-16 16:56:01,wallstreetbets,Same dude. My first (small) Yolo. 1100 bucks into it and it's started drilling immediately lol

2021-06-16 11:12:52,wallstreetbets,Going to buy in again 11 after selling at 19
2021-06-16 14:53:44,wallstreetbets,For real been saying this for a few days now
2021-06-16 11:26:03,wallstreetbets,I did go up!  It was 8 last month.  It was 20 two weeks ago.  It was 6 in January and went up to 30.  Why do apes need everything to go to 420.69?
2021-06-16 10:48:41,wallstreetbets,\-26% since jumping in.  This is the way.
2021-06-16 10:45:35,wallstreetbets,It's down at 12.90 hold;!!
2021-06-16 10:07:49,wallstreetbets,You and op need to sell covered calls. Bb has a crazy high premium
2021-06-16 10:03:45,wallstreetbets,"Never realizing gains either tho 🤔

The old adage of ~~one~~ tendie in the hand is worth more than ~~two in the bush~~ rocket to the moon

Tbh I'm still convinced the hype of this past year is a successful social media campaign that hijacked / piggybacked an honest effort to fuck with traditional traders.

The stock subs are now basically a botnet for trading that can be milked using 2-3 emoji's

Tldr; if you're in the US, and had the dumb luck to end up with 5-6 figures because you yolo'd on a penny stock: count your blessings, roll it into some etf's, and enjoy the rare life where having to take an ambulance to the hospital won't bankrupt you"
2021-06-16 10:04:30,wallstreetbets,42 or bust
2021-06-16 11:20:58,wallstreetbets,But *when*?
2021-06-16 07:46:27,wallstreetbets,So you expect the company to go from currently *barely recovering to <2018 revenue levels under insane inflationary conditions* to pulling in *$5-10bn of revenue* in the immediate future?
2021-06-16 11:46:48,wallstreetbets,This is called Averaging Down. You are doing it right.

2021-06-16 15:02:55,wallstreetbets,"I’m not sure but I think Market is red mostly today, not to mention people are panic selling and WSB has its focus on like 5 different stocks. So our buying power is divided."
2021-06-16 09:25:02,wallstreetbets,"I've already talked to several friends about this exact thing
. I'll call them in the am to tell what I'm buying, they immediately short it since it will drop 20-30% within an hour of me buying. Then they could give me 25% referral fee. If I get enough people on board I'll be on the moon in no time."
2021-06-16 10:48:12,wallstreetbets,That's what people have been saying since last last week

2021-06-16 10:57:59,wallstreetbets,Can you explain what “18 $20C 2023” mean? Sorry new to this.
2021-06-16 13:38:27,wallstreetbets,Buy the rumor sell the news. I expect it to go down even more next week.
2021-06-16 08:48:29,wallstreetbets,Life is 80% about luck. The remaining 20% is also about luck.
2021-06-16 12:13:23,wallstreetbets,Statistics prove that is the smart way. Accumulation and hold.
2021-06-16 11:46:07,wallstreetbets,"The hype has died down a little. But you also have to think there is a fed meeting, which might increase the interest rate which is making people dump stocks. So a lot of stuff is dropping. Pretty much all the stocks I follow are in the red or have been this week. Only a handful are in the green and it's by .01%-.98%

We also have to wait on the next earnings call which is on the 24 of this month. If they didn't lose money this 1/4 the price might go up on its own. But most annalists say that BB is only a $8-9 stock. That being said I am bag holding close to 20k in stocks bought around $18.5 a share."
2021-06-16 09:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Its on its way to the moon, its just taking a short cut"

2021-06-16 13:01:55,wallstreetbets,"I know what you mean. My point is if youve paid a lot down, then go cash out refinance that sum bitch before it's too late. $140k left at an assumed 30% LTV means by most HELOC rates available out there today you have an untapped $250k'ish equity draw you can use. 

&#x200B;

Bro, find a way to get cash out of your home, refinance if you must, but if you're really low on the principle (especially if you're under 1/3rd) then take out the max possible and go invest in some high dividend portfolio and pay your mortgage for free. If you can refinance at 2.5-3% I'm sure you can find a portfolio that pays more than that --> bam, free mortgage payments.   


The best part is, you wouldn't have to ever invest like a slack jawed retard ever again."

I bought my house 3 or so years ago, have right around 250k into it now, and the most recent talk with a realtor said I should list for 759k as similar houses are doing that and selling above asking price. (It's a duplex on 2 lots)

Now it's time to move onto a quiet acreage slightly out of town, used to think it would happen when I was getting close to retiring but I'm 26 and it looks possible almost immediately now."
2021-06-16 16:14:30,wallstreetbets,"That's awesome!  Might want to sell, pocket the net proceeds, and rent for a lil' bit though unless for some weird reason your target rural/suburban housing prices aren't also inflated.

The wife and I are mighty temped to sell as well, only everywhere we've looked to move to also have wicked high home prices, which feels like breaking even if you sell high and then buy high.  I feel like when the foreclosure moratorium lifts, a ton of homewoners who have been in forebearance will be faced with a choice of making payments or selling at the top of the market, which should inject some inventory (plus those people who will actually get foreclosed on)"

2021-06-16 19:50:14,wallstreetbets,You bought in the right area!  Good for you.  Be careful on the new buy though!  You could rent for a year and see if the house frenzy subsides or not.

You are being distracted from GME and the less intresting, but still relevant play, AMC. This is a shill post, paid by shills. The main poster receives about 200$, while the farm-feedback accounts in the comments gain about 0,50 $ for each comment.

Each single one ""I am ape, I got wish"" accounts is extrem shill-bait. They will activly cause you damage to your finances."

2021-06-16 11:22:54,wallstreetbets,~$100k here. I still have to put all or most of my chips on the table *with margin* to get decent theta returns. Feels super sketchy. I find it's still more profitable and safer from a risk management perspective to *buy options with 5-10% of my BP.

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DAL DD DISCO DOUBLEDOWN Headline get your attention?

It's almost 5AM on the east coast, there's rumblings preceding the fed's presentation later today. From a quick look at youtube for, ""DAL stock,"" it seems like interest in airlines is... scarce. THE FOOLS. Beside the fact that Delta was ready to go for a $1.2 annual dividend at the end of 2019, we're going to pretend that TSA statistics for 2019 would be just plane-jane straight-edge seltzer drinking business as usual. Three days ago, June 13, 2.1 million passengers checked in through TSA, compared to 2.6 million on June 13, 2019, this is only a decline of 20% in passenger traffic; June 13 2020 saw passenger traffic of 0.54 million, a decline of 80%.

You might look at this and say, alright, can you really be excited about a stock with news like,"" /only/ a 20% decline in passenger traffic?"" Possibly. What really cooks this stock steak rare-medium-rare and gives it juice is, international traffic has not returned with the same gusto as the domestic market. Sure, there's a 20% drop in traffic compared to pre-covid days, but I personally bet that most of those losses are international, and domestic airline traffic is returning faster than anyone can imagine. Delta post a loss of $3.55 per share last quarter, TSA barely got their hands on over a million people in a single day if they were lucky, this quarter? No day with less than a million passengers, recently an average of two million has been sustained. Current estimates put Delta on over a dollar loss per share this quarter, I call it in the black. Dividend back to $1.20 by Q4, DAL to $80.

Can you tell I stood in line at a security checkpoint recently?

Everyone please remember that this baby traded flat for five years when delta was had the best margins and product in the business. The only reason they ever approached $60 a share was because instead of building cash reserves like a responsible company they were buying shares back to try and lure a whale (buffet) into buying in and boy did that go poorly for him.

The desired effectiveness of the lawsuits remains to be seen, but may create tail gusts for companies like $WISH.

# TL;DR - some $WISH orders are already 100% fulfilled by Amazon

On somewhat related note, Antitrust lawsuit for Amazon may have upstream impact and could force more $WISH merchants to leverage Amazon's logistics services.

* Imagine how surprised was I - that after ordering a wrench set from $WISH app as part of my [earlier DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwt1ro/wish_personal_dd_fair_price_share_target_20/) \[ and brace for this fun fact\] , it came in an Amazon packaged envelope with the rest of my Amazon packages, delivered by Amazon. WOW!
* This delivery confused me to a point of contacting Amazon support to report receiving unsolicited package hinting at a Brush Scam
* After I realized WTF just happened, my brain started to connect the dots  

   * DOT 1) how HUGE Amazon is, and
   * DOT 2) how screwed Amazon is going to get after political bureaucrats are done with it, and
   * DOT 3) who ($WISH, not customers) stand to benefit from this.

as Natural Gas vehicels came into the spotlight thanks to $CLNE, I thought it might be useful to the board this link. The [California Natural Gas Vehicle Partnership](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cngvp/) has released a fact sheet detailing U.S. EPA National Air Ambient Air Quality Standards and the consequences if the State of California fails to meet basic attainment progress. The impact of increased [\#RNG](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=rng&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6810684763867811840) and [\#CNG](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=cng&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6810684763867811840) fueled [\#NGV](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=ngv&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6810684763867811840) investment to achieve federal attainment goals is included. [Here the pdf](https://cngvp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cngvp-federal-attainment-fact-sheet.pdf)

*""More than 35 million Californian’s (>90%) live with unhealthy air, with numerous cities and towns topping U.S. charts for having the worst air pollution—including ground-level ozone and particulate pollution. ""*

Basically, what the study found out is that with $750 million in funding, the State could finance 16'665 Natural Gas Trucks, vs 5003 BEV Trucks.

Opting for Natural Gas will guarantee the reduction of **1046 Tons of NOx**, against 167.2 Tons of BEVs; and reduction of **402'502 metric tons of GHG**, vs 91'216 of BEVs

**EDIT (1)** It happens to be seen how Californians think that they can adopt BEV trucks on a large scale when blackouts tend to be a seasonal problem. In this regard, here an update from today's Washington Examiner [https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-grid-operator-conserve-power-blackouts](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-grid-operator-conserve-power-blackouts)

**EDIT (2)** Here a quick article on the renewed interest in Natural Gas trucks, thanks to RNG (that is the main marketing point of $CLNE) [Nat gas trucks enjoying great interest thanks mostly to renewable natural gas surge](https://www.ccjdigital.com/regulations/article/15066002/natural-gas-trucks-see-renewed-interest) from the article, about BEV trucks competition:

\*\*\*""Threat to electric?\*\*\**Zero-emission electric trucks continue to gain ground particularly in California, where the state provides generous incentives to help fleets transition to zero-emission vehicles as a mandate requiring their market entry approaches in 2035.*

*However, Donnell said the state is not prepared to take on the amount of electric trucks needed to meet aggressive air quality goals, including those set by the Paris Climate Accord, which the Biden administration and California have embraced following the Trump administration’s rejection of same.""*

On June 10th, 2021, [Chevron announced the rebranding of its first CNG retail site](https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-brands-its-first-cng-retail-site), and declared the intention of opening additional 30 CNG stations by 2025 (that is more or less 5% the amount of stations operated by $CLNE)

[2020 CA NGV Fuel Use, RNG](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/18043/california-fleets-fueled-with-rng-achieve-carbon-negativity)

As you can see, RNG accounts for 92% of all natural gas used in transport in California in 2020, far higher than the national percentage ([53% in 2020](http://www.ngvjournal.com/s1-news/c1-markets/us-biomethane-surpasses-50-of-all-on-road-fuel-used-in-natural-gas-vehicles/)).

**EDIT (3)** *As a reader pointed out, the connection with the following paragraph may not be clear enough. My way to predict policy developments in a certain region is to look at what more advanced countries are doing and try to see if that approach fits into the examined case. For environmental regulation, California and US are way behind Europe, and Europe is way behind China in regard to infrastructure planning. That is why it is good to see what private corporations are doing in these places.*

# What is Happening in EUROPE?

Regulatory efforts to support Natural Gas Mobility are making private corporations conscious enough to chose to offer 100% RNG as soon as possible. Here what is happening with Liquind 24/7 and Envitec Biogas in Germany. [New Alliance encourages expansion of German bio-LNG fueling network](http://www.ngvjournal.com/s1-news/c4-stations/new-partnership-encourages-expansion-of-bio-lng-fueling-network-in-germany/)

*“Not only are we developing a new field of business, but we are doing pioneering work for the transition to more sustainable transport in Germany. The utilization of bio-LNG has significant potential to reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector compared with oil-based fuels. In addition, a well-functioning infrastructure is in place for the distribution of bio-LNG, whereas the comprehensive use of electromobility and hydrogen alternatives requires extensive development. Until these alternatives are ready for use, precious time is being wasted. The established CNG and LNG station infrastructure can and must provide a remedy. Together with LIQUIND as a partner for the marketing of the fuel at truck stations, we are able to significantly contribute to the decarbonization of heavy-duty traffic,” said Olaf von Lehmden, CEO at EnviTec Biogas.*

*For LIQUIND, the project is a decisive milestone and part of the company’s future strategy. By 2025 all LNG that are sold at the company’s fueling stations should be derived from renewable sources. LIQUIND has announced that it is aiming to reduce CO2 emissions compared to conventional diesel fuel by up to 100 per cent.*

This is the current offer of RNG in CNG & LNG stations throughout Europe, as of 2020 (please note that now in Europe there are more than 4000 CNG stations and 400 LNG stations). Roughly, 17% of all natural gas used in transport is RNG, with some countries achieving large shares (like Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, >90%)

Let me know if you have further questions"
2021-06-16 07:49:47,wallstreetbets,"Don't know if anyone took the time to DD this, but diesel engines, like those used in semi-trucks, can be *easily modified to run natural gas injection. They wouldn't run soley on NG, but the air would become more rich and combustible with a NG mix. This would increase the fuel economy by decreasing the amount of dosed fuel needed to achieve the torque required to pull a 20k lb+ load down the highway. Also decreases the emissions byproxy.

They make NG kits for full size pickups. I've seen them bring the fuel economy of a 7.3l Ford powerstroke from 12mpg to 18-20mpg. But that 20+yo engine is out of date by today's standards. Now we have computer controlled engines that are programmable to adjust for the smallest deviation in barometric pressure and load weight.

I honestly don't know what I'm yammering on about, I'm just a dude thats been working on big rig trucks for a decade and I'm tired of the emissions reduction systems they slap on these massive diesel engines, claiming they save the environment when in all actuality they hurt fuel economy and the production of these parts(and replacement parts) coupled with the CONSTANT need for repair and upkeep leave an even bigger carbon footprint.


Diesel/NG hybrid engines. I'd ape into that.

Edit: Apparently $WPRT Westport Fuel Systems is a front runner in NG injection systems for semi trucks. Take my money."

2021-06-16 04:52:26,wallstreetbets,"Well, California is ideologically-driven with activists determining policy. They don't care one bit about debt, budgets, and fiscal responsibility, so any kind of financial argument is irrelevant -- just read about their fancy $110+ billion choo-choo that may never get built as one example. They're also all-in on electric and will never hang it up in favor of natural gas, no matter how much ""better"" of a choice it may be."

2021-06-16 08:26:28,wallstreetbets,"Here's some words of wisdom from a country that has had a lot of LPG (natural gas) powered vehicles and have seemingly given up despite being one of the biggest exporters of gas in the world.

Australia has had a lot of government incentives to keep LPG powered vehicles on the road, even encouraging local car makers to make LPG versions of their popular sedans (until they pulled out of the country entirely).

For a while state governments even had rebates to convert existing cars to LPG and this kept a cottage industry of converting shops alive until the subsidies ran out.

And whilst for a while, every taxi was running on LPG. As soon as local manufacturing of cars exited. So did the glut of LPG powered taxis. Taxi firms quickly switched to petrol(gasoline/electric) hybrids instead.

So basically without strong government subsidies, LPG is going to die a slow death here. It doesn't matter if it's cheaper and cleaner to run than petrol because hybrids and full electrics exist.

Also despite the Australian government pouring billions into the gas industry, Oil/Gas will be a stranded asset when energy storage technologies mature in ten years. Renewable hydrogen is the only way out for the gas industry. But they still struggle to make natural gas sourced hydrogen viable vs EVs anyway.

The only way California, with it's strict air pollution regulations, will suddenly have an uptick in LPG powered vehicles is with massive government subsidies to pay entirely for LPG (or dual fuel) conversions of existing vehicles. This would also mean government paying for fueling infrastructure as well.

Basically the window for natural gas to boom is rapidly closing and will not be remotely profitable without massive government subsidies. Is it possible?

The trucks Amazon bought will be manufactured by CumminsWestport, which is a JV between Cummins $CMI and Westport and is about Spark ignition engines.

A possible development is the coming back of the dual fuel tech of Westport, HPDI, in the USA. HPDI is a compression ignition system. Cummins used to offer the previous version until 2015 but stopped to do so for the lack of environmental regulation, collapse of oil price (which made natural gas less appealing, and products problems).

The business case for RNG is for trucking, while you are talking about light duties. For light duties BEV are winning and will always win, with the exception of some emerging market countries whose grid stability is poor.

most of the RNG today comes from organic wastelands, and huge potential exists from wastewaters too which are not related to the dairy and meat sectors.

About lab-grown meat, of course, it will have a dramatic impact, but I suspect that its first adoption will be for animal food, not for a human one.

The race to reduce emission has started and it does make sense to build a RNG plant with an expected lifetime of 20+ years. If this is not enough and consumers will prefer lab grown steaks, probably other efforts will be needed by farmers in terms of water consumption etc.

Do not underestimate the amount of RNG that today is not captured from wastelands and wastewaters. That needs to be regulated, and if you can burn it in trucks, why not?"

Specifics like range and charging time don't matter to ideology. Neither does the impact of EVs on their already-failing electric grid -- which is a far greater issue. And never discount the the effect of activists on policy. All it takes is one group to claim some garbage like, ""the heat from natural gas vehicles threatens the lives of a three-toed salamander,"" and the industry will be killed.  


California's comeuppance will arrive eventually and the electric grid will be at the heart of it. They can't even keep the lights on year-round without rolling blackouts as it is and it's only going to get worse as they accelerate plugging EVs into it. They really need to overhaul their entire electric grid, doubling or tripling the capacity, to support their all-EV transportation obsession. Activists will never let it happen, either, assuming the foresight to pursue it even existed.  


If you want to make the case for natural gas over electric vehicles, California is definitely the wrong state to use as an example to justify it. Rational thought does not exist there."

Australia's environmental record is currently horrendous. 
Massive land clearing plus forest fires have devastated areas bigger than some European countries. Current federal government thinks coal/gas save us... well actually just it's donors... 

My state of Victoria is still recovering from a massive winter storm, many areas are expected not to have power for weeks. Given the current situation here I see energy storage and decentralised power generation having a strong future.
I've got a friend raising a new born in winter without electricity. They are lucky they have a wood fired heater. 

BioMethane is a very viable alternative, heck i reckon it's better than hydrogen, but not when current fossil fuel industry gets subsidised to a stupid amount. Bio gas doesn't have the billions in infrastructure the fossil fuel equivalent gets gifted to them by governments. 

But again look at a lot of developing countries being able to turn newly built sewage/septic tanks into bio gas capture for cooking/heating.  Solving sanitation and fuel problems simultaneously. There's no reason we can't do the same in developed countries. We can replace a good chunk of fossil fuel useage off our own poop gas.

Today's comparison between dairy farms and lab grown meat in terms of energy uses does not include the case of dramatic improvements for farmers too.

# Reopening of economy -

1. Vaccination count is going up everyday and Covid-19 cases count has gone down drastically, now daily Avg of new cases per day is below 10k
2. People have already started traveling for fun and going to their offices for work, you can see the traffic on the streets and freeways
3. Also you can observe the price per gallon of the gas you put in your car whenever you go to refuel it, it is way higher than what you used to put in pre-pandemic time
4. Labor is back and factories will soon run at their full maximum capacity
5. There is 1 and half years of pent up demand for consumption, travel and tourism which will unfold in next 1 year at least. So there will be super huge demand for OIL going forward.

As it was pandemic caused slowdown, recovery was K shaped. Y2020 was good for Tech stocks. But Y2021 is of companies who will benefit from Reopening of economy. We all can observe that in our surrounding the economy is reopening (explained above).  Moreover, Economies around the world is not just reopening, it is coming back with vengeance due to all the fiscal stimulus provided by Governments all around the world and quantitative easing programs run by central bank of all the developed and developing countries. There is massive amount of money in the world now compared to its pre-pandemic levels. This massive liquidity is going to send prices of all the commodities higher in near future, causing the INFLATION. Now lets come to the main point, OIL and GAS.

# Short term outlook on OIH (For next 2 years) -

Lets look at the price chart of Oil price and compare it with the OIH.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mo2io01agk571.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=75a15de6f08dab6848fea080aef8b68da6c0dafc

*OIL price vs OIH ETF chart comparison.*

As you can see OIH has always followed the oil price. Actually OIH follows the Crude oil rig counts, and rig counts follows the OIL price. So ultimately there is direct correlation between OIH ETF and OIL price.

Note: Rig Count, means the number of active drilling rigs

Oil rig counts are steadily increasing due to higher oil demand and Elevated levels of oil price. [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Oil-Rig-Count-Rises-As-Crude-Prices-Climb-Higher.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Oil-Rig-Count-Rises-As-Crude-Prices-Climb-Higher.html)

Also if we believe the trend and what OIL field analysts are saying that ""Oil price could reach $80 this summer"". [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Could-Reach-80-This-Summer-But-Theres-A-Catch.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Could-Reach-80-This-Summer-But-Theres-A-Catch.html)

Looking at the chart comparison, anyone can easily guess that OIH ETF is extremely discounted at its current levels. As per my analysis, OIH deserves the price in the range between $440 to $480 and should regain that level very soon. So OIH has at least 100% upside. Plus considering current Oil price and its forecasts, OIH might deserve more than above price range.

""With oil demand projected to reach pre-2019 levels by the end of 2022 and supply tightening, our oil and gas business is on the verge of an exceptional growth cycle.  Given our unique position and strategy, we are positioned to deliver outstanding returns in the short and medium term."" ---- Schlumberger CEO, Olivier Le Peuch says at Bernstein conference. (Schlumberger represents 22% of the holding of OIH ETF) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-schlumberger-stock-surged-15.8-in-may-2021-06-07](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-schlumberger-stock-surged-15.8-in-may-2021-06-07)

&#x200B;

There are still many investors who have parked their money in Tech stocks. Before Fed (JPowell) makes his move to stop QA, many of those investors will rebalance their portfolio and move to Energy and other reopening stocks. I am sure this is going to happen in next couple of months. So my friends in wallstreetbets, be the first and grab your pie in OIH ETF.

# Risk factor for the OIH -

Biggest risk factor to OIH ETF is falling Oil prices. In current conditions Oil price might fall due to 2 main things.

1. If OPEC+ increases the Oil production above what is expected
2. If Oil demand falls due to Covid-19 coming back IMO

Chances of occurring 2nd thing looks slim with availability of vaccines and approval to vaccines from different drug companies.

# Long term outlook on OIH -

As per my analysis, longer term outlook for OIH is still looks good. Because Oil demand is not going anywhere at least for next 10-15  years.

You might ask, what about the Wall street favorites, green energy companies, they might eat all the investments coming into the Oil sector? In my opinion, The current trend about the green energy companies (Solar, wind, hydrogen, EV) is just a bubble like 1999 dotcom boom and following burst of tech stocks in Y2000. So sooner or later it will burst, and that investment flow directly into Oil and Gas sector in short term. I am not against the investments done into the Green Energy, it is the need of the hour to stop global warming. I am actually pro-green energy companies, but we can't ignore the demand for Oil and Gas. Oil and Gas is our present, Green Energy is our future. We can't suddenly stop investments into Oil & Gas, its not feasible and practically viable.

“Some ecologists and politicians urge for a hasty energy transition, yet it requires an unrealistically fast launch of renewable energy sources and faces issues with storage, ensuring reliability and stability of power generation,” ---- CEO of Russian oil giant 'Rosneft' [https://www.worldoil.com/news/2021/6/4/russia-s-rosneft-projects-global-oil-shortages-during-hasty-energy-transition](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2021/6/4/russia-s-rosneft-projects-global-oil-shortages-during-hasty-energy-transition)

# SUMMARY -

Till now OIH ETF train had a good run in 1st half of Y2021 and now it has slowed down for some time. This is the time you can catch the train before its too late. The train will speed up soon in 2nd half of 2021, its next stop will be $340 and then $460 and beyond.

Note: I have position in OIH, stocks and Calls."

2021-06-16 06:45:14,wallstreetbets,"Two major issues with this analysis:

1. When I see a statement like: ""As you can see OIH has always followed the oil price. \[snip\] So ultimately there is direct correlation between OIH ETF and OIL price"", then **I want, no I demand, you show me the mathematical correlation**.  If you don't know what how to calculate a correlation, then you shouldn't be talking about correlations.
2. ETF's are never under or over priced - they have active market makers depending on the prices of the underlying investments.  To claim the ETF is undervalued is to claim one or more of the funds major investments is undervalued.  Why go through an ETF structure with additional fees when you can buy the underlying companies directly?

Sorry but that's a no from me dawg...."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ITUB the Waking Giant YESTERDAY (edited) I noticed an EXTREMELY unusual volume of Calls on the ticker $ITUB.

300k+ Calls.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y59bsm7s2k571.jpg?width=2081&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9208b1ea6e2a78dd69e7bcd521cf26ddd572fa34

ITUB is the ticker for Itau Unibanco, the largest private bank in Brazil. In recent years, Brazilian banking has seen a lot of change as many smaller fintech players are gaining headlines trying to get a bite of the 7th largest population in the world. Despite this, the top 5 banks holds 80% of banking assets with ITAU being the largest player. Perhaps COVID was the catalyst as ITUB has taken a drastic change in it's strategy to be a leader in the new banking age. An example is it's new e-wallet has reached over 1.5 million downloads in just 2 months and triple the next most popular e-wallet.

This bank clearly understands the direction it needs to follow to gain market shares in a changing world.

1. It is focusing on digital banking with its new itti e-wallet released in March quickly becoming the most user friendly and most downloaded in Brazil. 3x more penetration than the 2nd most popular
2. It is targeting Entrepreneurs and the future with its new Itau My Business which is a digital service that caters to all needs of new entrepreneurs like sales and service order management, financial management, automatic invoice issue, and integration with accountants.
3. It understands emerging market trends. In May, Itau became official sponsors of LOUD, one of Brazil's biggest esport organizations. This is the first time a major bank has sponsored esports in Brazil.
4. It fully understands the future of banking. To quote their CEO on a June 2nd interview: ""We've hired over 4,000 workers over the past 12 months to work in our IT area. We are today one of the largest technology companies in the country. We have all the tools we need, and we are able to build a more efficient, simpler and more agile bank.""

The financials show solidly the thesis with the latest march earnings report shows a 575% YOY revenue growth and 64% EPS.

I believe the huge call buys is someone trading with insider information on a huge upcoming announcement. This is going to be a HUGE earnings monster in the next 6 mo-year.

EDIT: BUFFET invested 500M earlier this year in Brazilian Banking."

The deal has been approved by the Brazilian central Bank

My Brazilian friend believes that this call volume is related to that and that someone knows that it will be announced soon.

This is a catalyst for a short run. There is a gap fill to $9 pre-pandemic

2021-06-16 16:19:31,wallstreetbets,"IMO Nio is a data and lifestyle company that sells high end luxury smart electric cars and offers subscription services for said cars. They hav over 25 “Nio house” built and are planning to double that this year. Nio houses are like clubs for Nio owners and subscribers. They are the blood of Nios lifestyle brand and that branding is working. The lifestyle they are building at Nio has resulted in the largest customer referral rate in the auto market. 

Nio is also building BaaS stations everywhere and they partnered with Sinopec this spring (chinas largest gas provider) to build these battery swap stations at Sinopec gas stations. These BaaS stations are designed to swap a depleted battery with a fully charged one in the time it would take to fill up your gas tank. Nio offers a subscription to this service and opting in reduces the cost of a Nio car by the price of the battery (making them much more affordable while still giving the revenue to Nio). Additionally, these BaaS stations give owners the ability to upgrade their batteries as technology inevitably advances throughout the life of their car. This totally changes the typical car value model and may actually help cars maintain their value after purchase.

On top if all that, Nio has award winning AI in their cars and they have taken the Apple route in outsourcing production so they can focus on R&D and customer satisfaction. 

Xpeng makes rly nice electric cars....

In short, Nio is everything Xpeng is plus a lot more. To be clear, I think Xpeng is also a great company with a ton of potential. But if you ask me to chose, I think Nio has the potential to completely disrupt and innovate the automotive market worldwide. I dont see how Xpeng can do that too with just their cars.

Edit: Nios ET7 may also be the best luxury EV in the world. The Xpeng CEO said it was the best car at the Shanghai auto show this year and it is truly an incredible piece of technology."
2021-06-15 23:44:12,wallstreetbets,My bad I like NIO better for a long term
2021-06-15 23:45:30,wallstreetbets,Nio vehicles look better. I just go with my gut 🤷🏼‍♂️
2021-06-15 23:46:19,wallstreetbets,Rich rebuilds got an Xpeng somehow on his channel.  Looked like it was straight outta a Tesla factory.  Talked to someone on here said Xpeng is Tesla copy but Nio was innovative… didn’t say how. China will probably be the one deciding though
2021-06-16 00:13:22,wallstreetbets,"Nope. I want a rebut of my claim if it can be done, not my thesis. Poking holes in a thesis is easy to do and would take discussion away from what I care about... Why people keep pushing nio when I don't see a reason why."
2021-06-16 00:06:46,wallstreetbets,"**changed to discussion flair. Your point is fair. For the record I've done my DD already. I'm more interested in why people are choosing NIO over a better company. Imo, NIO is only big rn because of lucky posts right during MEME stock high times that drag in everyone's attention"
2021-06-15 23:46:50,wallstreetbets,Funny how you didn't answer anything in here and just wanted to get Karma from being another WSB sh*thead bashing in a comment for no reason. Go to the r/kindergarten thread and have a fit with a five-year old who doesn't agree with you instead of posting useless garbage on a DD post
2021-06-15 23:50:10,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely not true! Xpeng has amazing tech that's rivaling Tesla atm, but with new stuff like the very first mass produced Lidar EV ever that can even 
navigate Chinese city conditions. Which. Is. Nuts. In terms of tech, they're definitely getting close to even... But that's besides the point. Innovation belongs to xpeng vs nio imo"

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$FTI: My Big Pud Play For May Has Come Back For More.   

**Why $FTI is still my favorite stock.** 

*A poem was written by Haraldo*

Let's get this out of the way: TLDR for the marsh dwellers that don’t like reading.  And yeah, I’m a new poster. I’ve been lurking since the beginning of the year and admiring you from afar. 

* **The Fundamentals:** FTI = Oil. Oil = Bad. Inflation = bad. Inflation+Oil= maybe. Some of you like it.
* **52- Week Performance**: +56.92%
* **Starmine Summary**: 9.4/10 (Very Bullish(Bullish=up(up=(roc(k)et))))
* **S&P Valuation**: 84/100 underrated, 99/100 growth stability, 71/100 financial health.
* **Short/Mid/Long Term Sentiment**: STRONG
* **MORNINGSTAR FAIR VALUE RATING:** **$25.00** **CURRENT PRICE:** **10.00**
* ~~Short Interest:~~ This ain’t a squeeze. Sowwy. 
* Options: VERY CHEAP. Many options expiring ITM on June 18th could be executed. 
* Upcoming Catalysts: July 27th Earnings call, which should be its second profitable quarter. See below. 2nd Catalyst: Options activity for July 16th include 100 $FTI stock and 20 $THNPY.
* My Plays: I only have 5 FTI calls for July 16th 10$ at the moment while I’m waiting for my funds to transfer from Fidelity to TDAmeritrade but will be opening a YOLO position for July 16th & Oct 15th. (My 9$ option sweep for June 18th played in my favor already, my money already made, so this info is here for YOU.) 

IF YOU DON’T LIKE READING, YOU CAN STOP NOW

If you recognize this stock, you probably remember me messaging you last month since my karma rating was low. I’m back, I made money with it, I’m not bag holding, and I’m here to tell you more. 

**Let's talk about oil.**

I know oil companies aren’t your favorite. We all want to believe in and invest in renewable energy because we’re all good people deep down inside. I feel the same. But I also know why you’re here. You want the Tesla. Let your oil stocks buy you a renewable energy vehicle. Shove it in their faces. 

But if we’re gonna be environmentally friendly while investing in oil, lets talk $FTIs progress. Their greenhouse gas emission 3-YR average is significantly lower than the average for an oil company. Despite working in regions with lower standards in 3rd-world regions, they have continued to reduce emissions and develop new technology to manufacture and implement subsea and land based oil extraction products. 

**Inevitable Inflation**

When you hear oil these days, you hear a lot about inflation. A few industries are more resilient to rising inflation, and typically businesses and individuals will invest in commodities such as gold and oil or real estate to maintain their asset value through bad times. On the other side of this, traders often will turn to companies that produce such products as a hedge against inflation; as the commodities maintain value, so will their manufacturers. 

**Morningstar Ratings**

Morningstar has given 2 reports this year giving this company a fair value rating of $25. I’m a little baffled that this has been sitting here between 7-10 this entire time, but then again, I know nothing about how this works. But I know the reason behind it: FTI has eliminated most of its debt by splitting its unprofitable company into another public company with less value. This has allowed FTI to be poised in a much better position to lower its remaining debt over time. This split led to its first profitable quarter. Now, it wasn’t a whopping profit, but it was profitable nonetheless. Since that day, the value of the stock has been rising on a fairly consistent basis, and the upcoming earnings report on July 27th is expected to be a much higher profit than the last quarter, given the last one was when the company had split off in the middle. Given the fair value rating, you’re looking at a stock with a 150% gain possibility. And we all know what happens if theres some unusual activity on the way to a fair value. 

**Volume**

The average trading volume of this company is fairly low. Activity has increased tremendously over the last month not only in the traditional stock purchase but in options purchasing. I’ve been watching and purchasing this stock since March (My first pick based on my own DD, its my baby and its been good to me) and I’ve seen my own bids dramatically effect options prices and have seen single orders shoot the price in one direction or the other. This could cause a very volatile stock with increased volume, and could even see a massive increase from a single whale alone. 

**One More Thing…**

I’m tired of typing so you’re on your own from here. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvcsi6ayrj571.png?width=3230&format=png&auto=webp&s=36cfc3f2bb78853e1ccb4b78f61f0f38dbdffb4f

Our last peak here in June is predicted to be the first Elliot Wave. This could mean a potential second larger wave pushing the stock price on its own. It's having a lot of other bullish signs in the last month as you can see. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to read. I’ve made more than a years worth of salary this year alone mostly from advice you guys have given me, paid off a tremendous amount of debt, and gave me a new fun thing to do that has given me value. I hope this post can do something for someone the way others did for me. If you disagree with some opinions or find better information than me, PLEASE SHARE. Taking advice from the comments has worked so much better for me than taking the original DD to heart, and as always: Do your own DD before buying! Ain’t no one know nothing bout what they saying."

2021-06-16 03:20:06,wallstreetbets,"it may be imminent or it may be next quarter.  Maybe  \*gasp\* a year.  But there will be a point when BB starts showing significant growth in one or maybe both of its well positioned business ventures (cybersec and automotive).  When that happens Wall Street will rush hard to buy up the stock, but so will WSB.  So will everyone. And it will happen fast because once there are signs of growth the market pounces."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ViacomCBS - VIAC, the only real deep value left in this market Okie dokie. So here goes. This past year has been insanity, and I think it has caused quite a bit of disillusionment and will also be detrimental to many bank accounts as we move increasingly closer to higher inflation and a rising rate environment. Hear me out.

So, some context, following my trading style, I was all over GME in late August when Cohen released his 13D; GME was already on my radar because of Burry, who's investing/trading style I try to mimic. DFV/Roaring Kitty, Rod, and others were also a big inspiration in spreading good, solid DD. It was a true deep value play. When GME released its Q2 2020 results on September 8th, it was terrifying, because we dropped almost back below $6; however, one thing shined through, and that was the almost $1 billion in free cash flow (fcf). The big push after that ER drop of course was the Microsoft partnership. That showed exactly how committed the console vendors were to keeping GME in business - making a console is actually not profitable, its the sales after the console, and GME is a huge part in reducing Customer Acquisition Costs for console vendors. Of course the SI was always the big thing - 140%, but it wasn't what made many of us have ""diamond hands"", it was the business, and its crucial role in the gaming industry - hell, what made Burry go deep in GME? When he got confirmation that the new console cycle would include disc drives. Anyways, my whole point is this - what made GME, GME, was its deep value, that it was, in the infamous words of Burry - ""A long term franchise trading at a significant discount from growing intrinsic value."" Which, always, is the preference when you are looking for the best possible trade to execute.

So what does this have to do with ViacomCBS - VIAC? Well, it is precisely that, it is a long term franchise trading at a significant discount from growing intrinsic value. How so? Ok, first, the basic test is this: what is its margin of safety based on discounted cash flow analysis (dcf); what is its enterprise value divided by earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization (ev/ebitda); and what is its price/free cash flow. This basic first pass test shows VIAC has: 49% margin of safety, 8.0 ev/ebitda, and 7.8 price to free cash flow. These are all really, really good for what is a long term franchise; and they have over $3 billion in fcf, a big fat number. Yes, debt is $19 billion, but they have total assets of $54 billion. Oh yeah, p/e is 9.8, which is not, in my opinion, the best metric for value, but its pretty damn good.

Ok, so they pass the basic deep value screener. But the real clincher is this. They aren't just ""value"" but are also showing GROWTH. Burry pounds this home, and he learned it from Graham & Dodd and Buffet. You don't look for just ""value"" or ""growth"", you find BOTH. So how is VIAC doing this? Well, look at how aggressive management is with their streaming strategy, which they are being extremely aggressive. First, we know they released Paramount+ in March, rebranding CBS All Access. Was it good, no. It was shit. However, they made it clear they are, and did, improve it. They recently dropped 1,000 movies, will drop a new movie every week starting in 2022, and, importantly, they will CEASE to license their content to third party streamers. No more movies/shows going to Netflix/Amazon. Besides CBS and Paramount Studios, VIAC owns Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, MTV, CMT, VH1, and several other networks that have hugely popular series. When they get all of that content exclusive to Paramount+, woah. For instance, look at Disney+, it took them about a year to get all the Marvel and Star Wars movies all centralized on Disney+, and when they did, subs went through the roof. Better believe ViacomCBS will get ALL their HUGE number of big movies and shows streaming exclusively to Paramount+. This is a big deal. Of course VIAC owns Showtime (doesn't hurt to mention they had the huge Mayweather PPV event this quarter) and between Paramount+, Showtime and BET+, they have 36 million monthly active users (MAUs). I think we will also see a bundle of Paramount+ and Showtime, and they just released an extremely cheap and competitive limited ad service for Paramount+ for $4.99. They are also being extremely aggressive with international markets - you know, the other billions and billions outside the United States.

Then there is Pluto TV, their AVOD (ad video on demand, Paramount+ is an SVOD, subscription on demand) free TV streaming service, literally free, and excellent, check it out if you haven't. They paid $300 million for it back in 2019; it now has over 55 million global monthly active users (MAUs) and rising. AVODs are the future, and it is projected Pluto will bring in ONE BILLION in ad rev by 2022. That is huge. Also, over the top (OTT) advertising is the future, and ViacomCBS owns the best OTT technology. OTT is basically this, based on your browsing history, connected devices, they will target you with ads that might be of interest to you, not simply the ads that everyone sees. This is the way all advertising will go, and VIAC is leading the way with one of the biggest free AVOD services, Pluto TV. Finally, Pluto TV is a ""super funnel"" to Paramount+. Everyone in the streaming business will tell you, the gold standard is to have a strong AVOD and SVOD, and that is what VIAC has.

Then of course there is Paramount Studios. They just had the highest grossing movie of the pandemic, A Quiet Place II. But even more important, the studio is fully reopened and in full production. Huge. Then of course CBS. Sure, older viewing audience, but don't balk at that. They have 6 of the top 10 shows in primetime TV. That is HUGE ad revenue. Also this quarter they had March Madness Finals, Masters, and the PGA Tour Finals that Mickelson won. Then they have the NFL, Champions League, and so much more in terms of sports, as well as the number one news network. All that can be streamed live on Paramount+. That is just more growth, more revenue, and advantages other streaming services don't have.

The real important point is this however: VIAC is the second largest content creator in the world, second only behind Disney. That is right, the second largest producer of shows, movies, and sports. In fact, that is all they do. They aren't a cable or phone company, they don't run an amusement park. They just make content, and content is KING in the streaming business, which is where we are all moving towards. They are the only major content producer that is vertically integrated that is left standing - i am not going to talk about merger and acquisition rumors, but Shari Redstone is more amenable to selling than we all think - and it makes VIAC incredibly valuable, incredibly valuable: VERTICALLY INTEGRATED. That means they don't just produce content, but they can distribute it via their own networks. MGM, bought by Amazon recently, was not vertically integrated. Now, when you look at their market cap, $26 billion, relative to all the content they own and their networks to distribute that content, they are INSANELY undervalued. Bottom line, this is a rare event, like GME was.

If you're getting concerned about what is happening in this market, what has happened over the last year, and get a feeling the ""party"" is about to end. Look even more into VIAC. I'm not going to pander and say I am a retarded autistic ape who eats crayons. However I do eat a shitload of chicken tenders."

Obviously, they need to execute but I think their sports rights give them some edge.  Amazon is pushing hard on trying to get more sporting so they are always a threat.

This might be a good low vol trade to offset the meme volatility.  IV is very low too.

2021-06-16 14:21:29,wallstreetbets,"I bought in after the collapse in later March... I think somewhere around \~$44... Between all the traditional TV channel brands they own and ramping up Paramount+ & PlutoTV, it's a solid long play IMO.  (Not stock advice.)

I'm surprised it's been pretty flat all this time and am considering buying some more shares. I don't think we will see too much action until this fall when new shows come out and hopefully movie theaters are in full swing.

At the very least, it's not likely to go DOWN significantly anymore... lol."

Paramount is a shell of its former self (and a rounding error in the P&L).

I personally think the likelihood of more closures soon is rare regardless, they know we just can't go through that again... so I think brick and morter will regain traction and hard... I just left LA and am visiting San Francisco... I've been traveling a lot and I can see these areas weren't as closed as news outletz woulf like you to think...

Lastly, I'm willing to make a prop bet that AMC will get into the digital game like HBO Max did... that's actually the reason i got into the AMC stock because if they announce a digital platform or partnership, that would be amazing and would thrive 🥰"

2021-06-16 02:43:10,wallstreetbets,"I'll bet you 100 shares of GME that they aren't going into the streaming game, too many studio companies have platforms already.  If Disney wants to do a digital release they will not offer it on anything but their platform.  Warner has HBO, Paramount has their service, MGM is getting bought by Amazon.  Why would they want to give a cut of the streaming side of a movie release to another company?"
2021-06-16 03:05:44,wallstreetbets,AMC already has a VOD service. Its lame as fuck.
2021-06-16 02:37:41,wallstreetbets,"Population is irrelevant beyond a certain point.  Even if these two locations sell out every single seat for every showing, it's  not going to change their cash flow position significantly.  

Amc has 978 locations, adding 2 more even if they are rockstar theaters that they can operate at maximum potential, it would take years to pay off the cost of acquisitions and not improve their cash flow problem significantly."
2021-06-16 03:17:47,wallstreetbets,"Look into AMCX, different stock, they're already have an entire company devoted to digital platform"
2021-06-15 23:17:46,wallstreetbets,Looks like the good news just keeps coming my way 😍
2021-06-16 02:14:17,wallstreetbets,Martians need 2 astronauts if you're in!
2021-06-16 14:32:02,wallstreetbets,"Have you see the interview? Do you know the numbers behind all of this? I suggest watching it. It’s a great listen for actual AMC fundamentals. AMC has 46,000 shares left to throw into the market. 

Yes he did dilute the overall free float but it was actually 20 million shares that were set aside for board member bonuses. They decided to sell it to help with their debt and help their overall credit which obviously led them to having their credit increased. 

We can’t ‘assume’ things if we don’t dig in deeper. AMC is very transparent in what has or is happening."
2021-06-16 10:29:06,wallstreetbets,But its good for me
2021-06-16 02:48:48,wallstreetbets,"I don't have shares of GME 😬... But that logic would mean that the next Marvel movies wouldn't be released in theaters, that's not how it works... a lot of movies have come out digital and brick and morter... i think covid started a new thing with movies but there will always be brick and morter movie watching, that's the bread and butter... that's why AMC is great... and Disney understands the theatrics behind a movie release in theaters, so in person movie watching will never go away... at least not any time soon"
2021-06-16 02:41:12,wallstreetbets,"I see that for sure but I think this is more of a symbolic gesture that can fuel more AMC visits nationally... as in, if AMC dominates these big cities with news like this, it will become more of a trend to go to AMC everywhere, if nothing else, for the novelty of it"

2021-06-16 04:57:41,wallstreetbets,Apparently you missed the streaming side in my last statement.  As they have been doing dual release.  Theater and streaming on their platform for a premium.  Why would they want to cut AMC into that?
2021-06-16 02:49:11,wallstreetbets,"There isn't a novelty to AMC theaters anymore.  Back in 2001 maybe.  This is good for press to attract a bump to stock interest, well it would be if it wasn't so high for their fundamentals as it stands.  I'll wager if they are successful in acquiring these locations they will use it as justification for more shares to sell to fund further acquisitions."
2021-06-15 23:20:58,wallstreetbets,"🤣🤣🤣... I mean as long as they're diamond colored crayons, I'm in"
2021-06-16 02:51:02,wallstreetbets,"I'd support that though for sure lol... but for places re-opening, there is a novelty to movie going and sporting events again... big releases will draw packed crowds, even people who wouldn't have normally went."
2021-06-16 03:40:24,wallstreetbets,"Short term, maybe.  I know up by me we have theaters that serve real food and have beer on tap.  Opened private theater rentals up during pandemic that made me never want to go to the movies with strangers in the theater again.  

I think crowded theaters will remind people that didn't normally go why they stopped going."
2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Here is a high percentage win, sleep well at night move $XOM -- I like this stock. This one for you guys!

Here is a high percentage win, sleep well at night move XOM -- I like this stock.

It's XOM for triple play:

\- XOM @ current price of $62 - $65 is still undervalue for the next 12 months outlook as the world is not even close to pre-pandemic return.

\- Engine no 1 case is heading toward a close.

\- Negative noises are heading out -- it actually created opportunities to buy.

\- XOM IV is still low for Option plays.

\- XOM with massive dividends for 12 months play.

\- Demand for oil is not slowing down as Crude Oil rise each week.

\- Iran deal seems to be priced in, even when it's still up in the air. An overreaction to the deal will create another buying opportunity.

\- Rising demand and producers hesitance to dive back in to put more oil in the market.

\- Crude oil has soared since the acceleration of Covid-19 vaccination programs

and continues to move higher on more widespread vaccinations and inflationary pressures.

\- Global demand still rising and won't be returning to normal until the Q3 of 2022.

\- Money continues to rotate into the commodities sector.

\- Monthly survey of fund managers by Bank of America showed that bullish commodities bets had overtaken Cryptocurrency B trade as the most crowded trade in markets.

\-  XOM price target at $90 by Bank of America and they believe XOM has capacity to raise its dividend in 2021. 

&#x200B;

Overall, XOM price actions combine with massive dividends and low IV options -- that's a triple play."

2021-06-16 00:43:17,wallstreetbets,"IF covid-19 2.0 hits, the market is not favorable and that is as good as if there's transitory inflation."
2021-06-16 00:53:53,wallstreetbets,"This is not financial advice, just my opinion.       

If Covid 2.0 hits we get reflation which means drop in interest rates which historically has pushed commodities down. If covid 2.0 hits, nobody will be driving because we will be in lockdown again. I also believe oil is something at a 5 year high. On top of that, as soon as Colorado and the Permian start pumping at max again, oil should drop down to sub $50 due to supply even with an import ban on oil. The only way I see oil going up from here is another war, or a steep jump in interest rates past 3.5% which is unlikely to happen."
2021-06-16 01:00:26,wallstreetbets,"Crude Oil has been going up since April of 2020, now - Rising demand and producers hesitance to dive back in to put more oil in the market. Crude Oil has continued to rise none-stop. Until then, hold and collect dividends and ride the wave for the next 12 months."

Yeah WISh Sells crappy products, but it does have almost fuck all to with their stock price. Look at their revenues, look at their bottom line, look at their p/e, compare it with industry peers. It’s undervalued by legitimately every single metric.


Not to mention that they’ve been making huge pushes to make their vendors more legit and aim to improve shipping times as well. Idk if anyone remembers but Amazon took years to sort that process out as well."

It's just not a good stock, Wish is not profitable, even during the pandemic where everyone was making money they were bleeding money and had slow, ultimately unsustainable growth.

I don't quite understand where all this newfound hype for Wish is coming from - an unprofitable company where 4 out of 5 items you order are either wrong or faulty (try it out, not like it costs much money, just have to wait for \~2 months to get your shit item, or enter ""Wish"" in youtube and watch people try to order stuff) ."

2021-06-15 23:50:32,wallstreetbets,Uh amc/gme are the OG meme stocks lol. I’m in amc too. Got into WISH early so when it gets back to its average I can sell and put my profits into amc lol. Currently only have 50 amc. Looking to get like 50 more from WISH profits.
2021-06-15 23:09:26,wallstreetbets,lol and amc and gm are what? long term investments? anyone getting in now will be in the red in a year
2021-06-15 23:13:53,wallstreetbets,How much do you think AMC can go up to?  I've already made like 30x my initial investment and I doubt itll go up 30x more.
2021-06-16 06:06:46,wallstreetbets,"100%

Calling it a pump and dump is one of the most retarded things I've read here. All you have to Google is ""$WISH analysts price target"" and you'll get figures twice what it's currently trading at.

Institutions bought a fuck load yesterday alone. So big that Benzinga and the likes have been reporting on it the last 24 hours.

So according to the crayon eating moron above your comment, institutions, analysts and wsb are all colluding this huge pump and dump of $WISH. SMH. Some people are truly retarded."
2021-06-16 06:04:01,wallstreetbets,"Amazon took 7 years to turn a small profit. And that’s with first mover advantage in the online retail space. Wish is 10 years old, entering a much more saturated market and still turns a terrific amount of revenue. Their gross profit increased 10% YOY.

Truth is, entering this space and figuring out logistics, warehousing, supply chain issues, marketing takes a terrific amount of expenditures to their SG&A line. Amazon took 10+ years to figure out prime and 2 day shipping,  on select products only. Wish is currently where Amazon was in early 2000s"
2021-06-16 05:40:48,wallstreetbets,"Revenue went up during the pandemic. Losses arent uncommon seeing their marketing. 

The fact the SI is at ~50% and daily volume is at around 100 million its kinda obvious how big its being shorted. 

It might be a very shit amazon, but their target isnt ppl that can buy on amazon..

I genuinely think the shareprice is undervalued atm.

2021-06-16 08:03:22,wallstreetbets,Right. When people call it a BS company or a pump and dump it tells me they just don’t know how to read financial statements
2021-06-16 05:48:16,wallstreetbets,"and I respect that, like I said I personally don't understand the sudden interest. Revenue went up because it was a pandemy - every online shopping outlets revenue went up, AFAIK Wish was the smallest growth though.

It's shorted because everyone thinks its currently overvalued, and I agree. Shorting is not a BAD thing per se, it's when hedge funds hunch together and artifically pump or short a wrongly valued stock, that's when we should act.

As it stands, and again it's my opinion and nothing more than that, I think Wish is valued correctly, if not overvalued right now. The sudden interest is... weird. It was a good start with Wish when the incredibly low prices and massive sales brought in customers - but now Wish is just a synonym for ""cheap chinese crap that doesn't work and you buy to make fun of it""."
2021-06-16 12:23:11,wallstreetbets,LOL no you’re in the right place
2021-06-16 07:45:07,wallstreetbets,"gone are the days? No. I’m saying this post is about “Wish” a stock thats undervalued at current price and a decent company. Is it a long term pick? sure at this price you probably could hold it and sell in a year to pay lower taxes on profits.. Aka not a pump and dump. you claim AMC/GME is where its at, but at their current prices new investors are taking on huge risk for what? 2x at best and high taxes on profits, and huge risk if it falls apart before they sell.. a pump and dump.."

Minimum 18 months. **So each car produced will generate $25 minimum...50 million cars with QNX(includes recent china lead) is about 1.2billion pure revenue a year. The Ivy will generate about $10 per car a year...deployed across 175 million cars is about $1.75billion annually and growing.**

2021-06-16 10:34:16,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Out of all the meme stocks, I think BB and NOK are smartest, because they actually have long-term potential. AMC may be fun for now, but honestly, with Netflix/HBO/Amazon/Hulu/etc all taking a bite out of cinema $$, how much potential for growth do movie theaters have? But BB and NOK have real innovation happening that is integral to their future growth. I have put what I can (I am poor writer) into BB and Nokia, because I see what their plans are. Nokia has Bell Labs: [https://www.bell-labs.com/](https://www.bell-labs.com/), an inventor incubator: [https://inventwithnokia.nokia.com](https://inventwithnokia.nokia.com/?_ga=2.237932809.881848506.1623853710-1041330497.1620437923),  a business development branch: [https://open-ecosystem.org/](https://open-ecosystem.org/). They are heavily invested in 5G. So I don't look at these two companies as meme stocks at all, but as companies that are poised to rebound BIG in the next few years."

1. that these Car partnerships are also consisting of evaluation projects, PoC's and Pilot projects. What actually goes into production is yet to  be seen.   

2. Nivida and their platform is a another large player who is chosen as partner and actually into production of Tesla today, and most likely in some other OEM's in near Autonomous drive future for Level 3-4 AD cars.   


Just to clarify I'm not against BB ( I actually own some stocks myself ) ,but I thinks it's good to know what we're up against.

2021-06-16 09:06:23,wallstreetbets,"All software has vulnerabilities, the only perfect code is that which hasn't been written yet. Government backed hackers tend to be well resourced (think money, skills and tools), because of those resources they tend to find more exploitable holes in highly secured software than your average hackers. No amount of testing is going to find everything, although I agree testing and secure coding do work well in hardening it against attackers.

Research the solarwinds hack if you want to see a novel, real world, example of just how effective some of these groups are. If they want in bad enough, sooner or later they will get in."

2021-06-16 02:07:33,wallstreetbets,"Ah damn, I guess I wasn't aware of that. Yeah they should really stop licensing the name, imo a big part of what holds BB back is the legacy issues of being thought of as a ""has-been phone manufacturer"""

2021-06-16 07:26:24,wallstreetbets,The figure is based on design wins and number of ecu modules in cars. The goal is $25 per car (50mil car a year) and recurring $10 per car(175 mil car) through ivy. Ivy will run on pretty much every car since it’s software agnostic so not just limited to 175mil cars it can expand to like 500mil cars.

2021-06-15 23:09:11,wallstreetbets,Pro tip: There’s not much benefit to trading levered ETF options long. The volatility is priced in and options are very expensive — makes more sense for short Vega plays. These options are usually priced with a ton of IV so unless there are massive moves you’re screwed on the long side. Sharpe ratio is much higher just trading QQQ/SPY options + they’re more liquid.

https://preview.redd.it/fp2vrxsqnj571.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26b81f585862238470e848b85b8bf5136b52052c

I currently hold an approximate $1.2 million position in $BARK, in the form of common stock, warrants, covered calls, and puts that I have sold. I’ve averaged up 3 times, and have eaten every dip.

https://preview.redd.it/q0n4csepej571.jpg?width=1158&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36c4158056e6c32a4129624159ac8d697e460909

&#x200B;

**Summary**

* Dog owners love their dogs.
* Before $BARK, there was no company that was able to deliver the full spectrum of products that dogs need **under one universally trusted** brand.
* Most dog brands exist in their individual silos, i.e. just food, just toys, just sticks, etc.

&#x200B;

It started as a monthly dog toy subscription service. Since 2020, it has added new divisions in order to be the go-to brand for all products your dog will ever need.

* Barkbox has created a loyal base of 1.8 million subscribers,
* Low churn rate of 5.4% --- and has expanded into other products to maximize the value of this consumer relationship.
* Thanks to it’s recent IPO, the stock has a warchest of \~$427 million to further boost its growth.
* **Vertically integrated, they make their own stuff which is why gross margins are high**

&#x200B;

My thesis is that Barkbox has created a noteworthy sticky brand - and will see substantial growth through it’s multi-pronged approach at monetizing it’s client base.

* Most recently, Barkbox was added to Amazon’s subscription boxes landing page. This is a new development. More info about this can be read [here](https://www.pymnts.com/subscription-commerce/2021/third-party-subscriptions-amazon/) and why it’s so important.
* With over 50% of the e-commerce market on Amazon, Barkbox’s new inclusion into Amazon subscription will boost it’s existing revenue.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Opportunity**

* $36.9 billion is estimated to be spent on food in 2020
* $19.2 billion is estimated to be spent on supplies/otc medicine
* $29.3 billion is estimated to be spent on vet care

[During covid, an estimated 11.38 million US households have gotten a new pet.](https://todaysveterinarybusiness.com/pets-appa-survey-covid/)

* Petcare market in the USA is more than $50 billion and will continue to grow.
* Pet industry is mostly dominated by brick and mortar retailers.
* The pet market is in the early stages of innovation and is brimming for something new.

According to[ PYMNTS.com](https://securecdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Subscription-Commerce-Conversion-Index-November-2020.pdf), ¾ of US adults - 182 million consumers, subscribed to at least 1 subscription service since last July. Nearly 50% of consumers who signed on for a new subscription since the pandemic began intend to stick with it even after the pandemic is over.

&#x200B;

**The Team**

Former co-founder of Meetup, Matt Meeker, is Executive Chairman/Co-Founder.

Former Director of Amazon Global is CEO.

Members of the management team have been featured in Fast Company’s list of “Most Creative People,” and Forbes “30 under 30”, among other accolades.

**Omni-channel Distribution**

* Barkbox has built an impressive brand, and it collaborates with retail partners in addition to selling directly to consumers.
* It’s distributed by major retailers such as: Target, Amazon, [Costco](https://dogoday.com/2021/02/04/costco-barkbox-collection-is-back-and-its-super-cute/), Walmart, and Petsmart
* It does joint collaborations with brand such as [Bluestone Lane](https://bluestonelane.com/barkxbluestone/), and even [Anheuser-Bush](https://barkpost.com/life/bark-budweiser-7-pack/), among many others, such as the [NBA](https://www.barkbox.com/themes/NBA).

&#x200B;

**Barkbox has over 1.8 million annual active subscribers.**

In an investment deck for the popular App Acorns, BarkBox was mentioned as having one of the biggest subscriber bases, alongside big brands such as: NYTimes, Dropbox, Peloton, and Spotify - due to its impressive subscriber base.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Competition**

Barkbox has no true competitors. Most brands exist in their own individual silo, i.e. just food, or toys. Other competitors like Chewy, are marketplaces.

$HIMS is a consumer subscription based model, that seems to be a good peer for comparison purposes. Due $HIMS recurring subscription revenue model, it is a good comparison for discussions. Based on $HIMS valuation, this would support $BARK trading in the $15-20 area.

For general purposes, I have included a comparison of other pet related brands.

CHWY - Chewy

FRPT - Freshpet

TRUP - Trupanion

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Risks**

No DD is complete without thinking about the bear case.

Most recently, Chewy, a competitor of $BARK, reported profits but warned of labor shortages and supply disruptions.

Even though $BARK is vertically integrated, it is likely that it will have the same labor and supply disruptions, as all businesses are facing.

Shortly before it’s IPO, $BARK was accused of selling a chew stick that killed a pet. There is no evidence the chew stick was responsible.

* Instead of ignoring the allegation, Barkbox immediately addressed it via social media, and said it was working with the manufacturer to look into the death.
* Barkbox immediately stopped distributing the item.
* Their emphasis on “doing the right thing,” speaks loudly to their ethos, and means we can trust them to do the right thing and continually expand with their consumer base

**Market Reaction**

* Buy rating, and $16 PT from Cannacord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps.
* Buy rating, and $14 PT from Jefferies
* The stock IPO’ed at $10, and has slowly risen and is at $11.35 on 6/15/2021.
* Fidelity owns 8.3% of $BARK, which is an impressive sign of their confidence in the company. In addition they ANCHORED THE PIPE!

&#x200B;

**Investment Highlights**

Barkbox is a real company, with real revenues. The team has demonstrated it can execute. As investors, the goal is to find the next big thing. Without a doubt, as Barkbox continues executing in many of it’s new divisions, it will become a highly coveted gem.

* The pet category is big and growing
* This is a digitally focused brand, which is doing both DTC and collaborating with major brands for increased exposure
* It uses data, to improve the subscription experience and to personalize the box/product for its clients - STRONG RETENTION!
* It can continue to accelerate growth by introducing new products, cross selling, and adding more channels.

&#x200B;

**Business Model:** Barkbox will continue to grow it’s subscription services direct to consumers, in addition to distributing its products with retailers like Amazon.

&#x200B;

**Defensibility:** Barkbox has an impressive 1.8 million base of recurring consumers, and is considered one of the biggest subscription services.

&#x200B;

**Capital:** Thanks to it’s recent IPO, it is flush with cash

Because I like the stock so much, I bought some more warrants.

2021-06-16 01:38:10,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been a bark box subscriber for 2 years and I have to give credit where it’s due - this company crushes. The toys they make are dope - some of them have other toys hidden inside of them, which my dog loves because she likes to murder stuffed animals. Also, I’m pretty sure the boxes are lined dog crack, because she KNOWS which box is hers when the delivery comes and she gets so excited.

I honestly don’t even care how much the service costs anymore. They could double the price and I wouldn’t flinch.

2021-06-16 00:14:17,wallstreetbets,Correct.  Spend on pets has increased every year for the last 25 years (every single year).  Couple that with the increase in pet ownership due to Covid coupled with the fact millennials are choosing not to get married and instead adopt animals for companionship - this stock truly has the potential to be a very big player in a growing market should they be able to capitalize on their loyal following and expand their business (as planned) into other areas of pet care.  I personally hold this in my IRA as I believe it is a very solid long term hold that will continue to grow for years to come.

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Now that shit has somewhat calmed down here, lets try this again: Ammo. Sports. Orgies. ; ASO, a DD: # TL;DR - ASO has done nothing but 🚀 hard since IPO, and they'll continue to do so as they grow more and realize their full valuation. This week has presented a prime entry point, with ASO laying on its back with its legs behind its head. A lot of upside here.

**I also left a bonus for you at the end of this post.**

Hello again apes, cow far sniffers, and recently committed wish.com shoppers,

First things first, and I want to get this out of the way before I get distracted and forget... Happy pride month to all of you FD warriors out there throwing retarded amounts of buying power at weeklies on tickers that have no business existing. It's beautifully ironic that, in our search for the top, we have found that only bottoms have no limits. I love all of you equally, even you u/MadCastEpic.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, this is my opinion, do your own DD. Unlike my other DD, this one will not reference ass to mouth, sorry. There is only one emoji in this entire post, sorry. As far as ASO goes..... I like the stock.)

# Moving on...

A lot of you probably didn't realize that Academy Sports & Outdoors (ASO) existed. The odds of most of you going to a store that sells things that help you enjoy your life outside of a pillow fortress in your basement are slimmer than PLTR staying green for more than 2 sessions. I digress. Point here is that a lot of normal, less-retarded people do spend time outside of their homes in the sun and even sometimes do those things with other people. And when I say a lot, I mean *a lot.*

ASO deals in all things outdoors. Guns, ammo, team sports stuff (not e-sports), apparel, shoes, etc... Notice I didn't say anything about video games, free popcorn, cow farts, or shitty knock-off items (looking at you wish-tards). We're talking about a whole different animal here; a business with mega earnings beats and real sales. Academy is located mainly in the Southern United States and operates 250+ stores. In the year 2000 (ancient history for some of you autistic fucks) they had 35 stores. They're growing like that weird thing on your aunts face that you're ""not supposed to talk about.""

ASO went public via IPO in October of 2020 at a price of $12 or some shit. Let's take a look at what it's done since then, starting with the first 6 months of it's life:

**^(WARNING: This next section contains some really retarded Travelcenters of America type of shit. Look at these extremely simplified charts may cause wrinkles, but is more likely to further smooth your brain; you're welcome.)**

https://preview.redd.it/hvjy089dbj571.png?width=1945&format=png&auto=webp&s=482cedd1b2b8b0aa64899b0b9f5af7f212eebe8b

As you can see (or maybe you can't because it's so fucking small) ASO doubled 🚀 in its first 6 months on the market. For you really smooth brains, that's about $12 or 100% of upward movement. Now let's take a look at the 2 months or so since then...

https://preview.redd.it/484xbzuhbj571.png?width=1470&format=png&auto=webp&s=c793e2a46d80c974b306b889ed410cbf94fcc995

The earnings call in late March/early April was the kick in the ASO this thing needed. People started to realize this thing was undervalued and making fuck tons of money.

**Just for reference - they absolutely murdered their most recent earnings too (last week):**

* Adjusted income of $182.5 million vs Q1 2020 $400,000 income **(profitability)**
* EPS of $1.89 (estimate was $0.90, 100%+ beat) vs Q1 2020 $0.01 **(shareholder value)**
* Revenues up 40% year over year to $1.6 billion vs already optimistic estimate of $1.5 billion **(sales)**
* Upped their 2021 guidance to $4.50 EPS (I think it was $3.90 or $4 or something who cares)

**ASO is currently trading at a P/E ratio of about 7. The US industry average for specialty retail is about 15, representing a 100% upside based on P/E alone** and not considering the fact that it's banging harder than a group of soccer moms out late after a PTO meeting.

# ""I see the lines and all the dildos, but what do I do?"" A fair question, fellow retard. I have no fucking clue...

I'm not so great at drawing with crayons, just eating them. If you draw that blue line that touches the bottom of the low candles and insert a moving average (hey how are ya babe) - the moving average is as close to that line today as it's been in months. These red days thanks to inflation fears and the fed have opened the door for more retards to climb on board to tendyville. I believe this to be a great entry point. I like saying entry point.

&#x200B;

**One last little nugget for you....** There's a bunch of words that auto mod picks up and deletes posts for, so I'm not going to say them, but take a look at this setup for ASO. *Appears to be some sort of primitive lift off ramp......*

2021-06-15 23:27:08,wallstreetbets,"I have some shares. I think the dip today is also an over reaction to the retail sales report that came out showing a drop in sales. This drop was driven primarily by cars because there weren't any cars to sell (chip shortage). The rest of the retail industry that did have stuff to sell did well, and ASO was part of that.

Also, they did an investor conference today. Take a look at their stats on revenue per square foot compared to their competition...it's WAY better. [https://investors.academy.com/static-files/0a7e3a55-43c9-49d8-9af4-8d1b40460222](https://investors.academy.com/static-files/0a7e3a55-43c9-49d8-9af4-8d1b40460222) (slide 26; over $300 per square foot compared to Dicks at $228. We don't have the bass pro number here as they are private and probably don't publish that number; it may be more competitive.)

I've been impressed with ASO. They have tons of runway for expansion, low debt, and are smashing their numbers. Really can't complain about them right now. As for the other bonus at the end...we were at the $40 mark earlier this week until today's drop. Not entirely sure that will come to fruition, but I won't complain if it does...lol"

I mentioned this yesterday on another post: It's currently downtrending but within expected trends. Historically, it usually bounces back up once meeting the 20-day moving average. I expect it to continue to drop to ~37 which is the current 20-day moving average and then bounce back up to ~45 afterwards. Definitely could hit $60 within the next 2-3 months at this rate. For now, I plan on and am happy to buy more calls as it dips down to the 20-day average

Edit: briefly dropped to ~$37 today as expected before bouncing back up. Bought another call during the dip and it's now printing in the green :)"

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Guide for Tomorrow (aftermath of Fed announcement) I don't expect JPOW to announce anything different tomorrow. But in case he mentions anything about planning to taper, don't just rush in to buy puts or short the market. Some of it or all of it might already be priced in - or maybe not. Nobody can tell for sure. So remain calm and check the action in the 10Y bond yield and EURUSD.

Expectedly, any significant announcement about taper should mean

1) Bullish Dollar
2) Bearish TLT

Meaning: yields should shoot up at significantly pace higher and dollar $DXY should start rallying. If DXY starts rallying, EURUSD would dip.

All of the above is bearish for stocks. All sorts of stocks. This will give a signal of what's to come. So check that first, before making any move. Mentioning this because I plan to do the same.

On the flip side, if there is little to no reaction in yields, DXY or EURUSD, but the stock market moves violently, think of it as noise. Chances are stocks will continue to go higher.

All being said, still don't expect Fed to mention anything different on tapering."

The decline of said stocks, if I remember correctly, was triggered by a spike in interest rates and Janet Yellen stating her opinion about tapering. Either way, anticipation of a taper announcement is a headwind for the market. It’s entirely possible that “ripping the bandaid off” will be the catalyst for a new leg up in the market, even if there is some short term pain as a result, it is a small price to pay if you have a longer time horizon."

2021-06-16 11:21:32,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the comment. I agree on all points. I think the fed will taper too late and to low and inflation will happen. A penny for your thoughts on how much inflation we'll see in say in 2025? I think a lot of the  correction in growth has already been built into the prices due to expectations of the bond yields future behavior. DNMR is a quintessential example of growth. Fell from $64  Feb 11 to $15.7  May 12 or  -75% in 90 days due to stimulus bills being passed. Consider what kind of inflation would be warrent such a drop. Suppose all DNMRs returns on $x occurred in 2031. Before stimulus inflation is 2% so those return might be $x/1.02^10=0.82*$x. In order to find an inflation that would justify -75% price drop: 0.25*0.82*$x=$x/i^10 i=1.17 or a 17% inflation rate over the next 10 years. That seems a bit high to me. Admittedly it got up to 13% in 1988 but didn't stay there for 10 years. TLDR I think inflation expectations are already built into growth stock prices.
2021-06-15 23:10:51,wallstreetbets,Explain it to me like I’m 5…and Canadian…what’s gonna happen? And when?
2021-06-15 22:59:40,wallstreetbets,I'm projecting 40% drop based on several things and that's where it crossed before EOY. Shifted everything including 401k away from regular market or funds.
2021-06-15 23:02:54,wallstreetbets,40% wait till the fed removes eight trillion from their balance sheet and raises rates to 3% there won’t be a stock market left.
2021-06-15 23:58:36,wallstreetbets,So incoming red for the next month or so then steady and slow climb up ?
2021-06-15 23:09:34,wallstreetbets,Good
2021-06-16 00:08:03,wallstreetbets,I'd say July turns horribly red as inflation skyrockets higher and is actually shown fully in the numbers around the same time the fed finally starts moving. Toss in a few more factors all in same quarter and last half of year looks like pure dogshit. Recovers some 2022-2023.

2021-06-16 07:34:24,wallstreetbets,"""Transitory""...no one in history has ever used the term until a couple months ago. It's a meaningless word...2 months is transitory...20 yrs is transitory. When the financial guys are playing political tactics with nonsensical words, that always scares me. CPI was awful and markets went high...PPI was worse and markets went higher before finally pausing a bit. PPI flows down to CPI over 1-3 months. So it's a slam dunk that CPI is much much worse the next 3 months and longer if PPI continue worse (all indications are it is accelerating). JP is already on the proverbial slippery slope and I'm not sure he could stop it now even if he made a dramatic move today. What do I know...I hope I'm wrong since all this impacts the projects I work on."

2021-06-16 03:07:23,wallstreetbets,Wut lambo?
2021-06-16 00:40:31,wallstreetbets,He bought a bunch of GME call options a long time ago and now they are worth a fuckton of money.

2021-06-15 23:10:19,wallstreetbets,This.
2021-06-15 22:49:33,wallstreetbets,Sure
2021-06-16 11:24:51,wallstreetbets,Ahhh I see my bad I just took a quick glance
2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,AMC was good to me today and decided to bless me with $50k 🍿📽 
2021-06-16 01:08:33,wallstreetbets,"Some make money others, like me finally get dressed at 5pm and masterbate 3 times before lunch."
2021-06-15 21:29:01,wallstreetbets,Purchased these contracts at open and sold ~45 minutes later. Not displeased with the outcome!
2021-06-15 21:30:52,wallstreetbets,"I wish I was as successful at being retarded, dang!"
2021-06-16 17:21:20,wallstreetbets,"I was doing this was pretty decent success with with 60 and 70% gains, then I started holding options and that kinda got me. The theta decay is real."
2021-06-16 00:58:13,wallstreetbets,I have to learn options for the next round. I’m not able to afford them now. I’m currently paper trading options on amc and got 990 shares in reality. I’ll hit the options up maybe later on. I’m not comfortable with them yet. But I know that is where the money is made. The real money.
2021-06-15 21:41:14,wallstreetbets,But did you sell?
2021-06-15 23:25:02,wallstreetbets,Can you buy me an ice cream sundae? 😭

2021-06-16 01:05:55,wallstreetbets,AMC has a specific price pattern each day.  It seems to always dwindle down in the afternoon if momentum is lost around the morning hours.

I thought GME was a once in a lifetime event, but I'm now beginning to appreciate the reality of crowdsource (memestock/WSB) manipulation - it's very real and very awesome  :)"
2021-06-15 21:45:58,wallstreetbets,"Off topic but what is the best app to see all your investments in one place? Like to link my 401k, Robinhood account, and TD account into one chart so I don’t have to check all the apps"

2021-06-16 11:26:32,wallstreetbets,To this day AMC was my best option position all time in Jan. Not holding anymore but it’s still a hell of a play ❤️🦧
2021-06-16 11:38:08,wallstreetbets,"So you bought a bunch of $60 calls, then sold at $63 same day? Is that right? If so that’s pretty cool! I never really thought about selling options same-day"
2021-06-15 21:45:00,wallstreetbets,Platform?
2021-06-15 22:17:44,wallstreetbets,Yeah what made you so confident about this?

2021-06-16 09:43:24,wallstreetbets,"And to anyone who is starting out trading and not confident enough to jump into a meme stock due to volatility, I love love love TQQQ. You do not have to be a timing wizard on that one or babysit it every second to get trades right. It just consistently churns up.

2021-06-16 15:09:08,wallstreetbets,Congrats you retard!
2021-06-16 16:24:56,wallstreetbets,Congratulations and F**k You!
2021-06-16 17:04:46,wallstreetbets,Did you close your position yesterday?
2021-06-16 18:22:06,wallstreetbets,I'm keeping my few shares and only selling until it hits $500k.
2021-06-16 06:20:08,wallstreetbets,Stop posting gains bruh.  Majority of apes dont give AF.
2021-06-16 11:13:16,wallstreetbets,Man I'm waiting for TLRY to make massive gains like this cmoooon!!!

2021-06-16 17:46:59,wallstreetbets,Can we make a social system where people who win tons in options give a little to the fallen soldiers such as myself? Just hypothetically.

2021-06-16 11:25:21,wallstreetbets,Bought and sold the same day? That's either bold or foolhardy
2021-06-16 06:25:24,wallstreetbets,how much were the contracts
2021-06-16 18:10:32,wallstreetbets,"Sorry newbie here. So the cost for you to ante in was $128,880.62? And from that 50k was made? 

If so nice! If not, then I'm probably misunderstanding."
2021-06-16 06:24:50,wallstreetbets,50k would literally change my life
2021-06-16 09:26:47,wallstreetbets,I always tell people options are the fastest way to OR lose money. You’re smart to learn them well before you enter the options world.
2021-06-16 17:21:15,wallstreetbets,Sell puts on all those shares you own.
2021-06-15 21:52:07,wallstreetbets,I did
2021-06-16 00:07:04,wallstreetbets,There’s a lot of talk about a gamma squeeze very soon.  I was honestly shocked to see the state of the sub the other day when it suddenly flooded with CLOV CLF WKHS WOOF SENS….
2021-06-15 23:07:10,wallstreetbets,I would also like to know this
2021-06-16 09:30:09,wallstreetbets,"If I recall correctly, it opened above what I had marked as resistance, the volume was strong, MO (momentum oscillator) showed bullish, MACD showed bullish, and RSI was not oversold. Those are usually the indicators I watch and I don’t usually jump until they all align. Most importantly of all, the price action on the candles made me feel bullish."
2021-06-16 09:32:22,wallstreetbets,That is so true…what do you think about the fact that it appears to be starting out opposite today? I’m watching for a strong reversal candle right now…
2021-06-15 21:41:58,wallstreetbets,Can you explain more id like to copy this tmrw lol
2021-06-15 21:49:11,wallstreetbets,Not off topic at all! I use and love Mint

2021-06-16 12:14:29,wallstreetbets,"Yep, that’s exactly what I did. Have you traded options before? Be verrrrry careful if not. They’re tricky beasts."
2021-06-15 21:52:20,wallstreetbets,Fidelity. I use Active Trader Pro
2021-06-16 09:40:42,wallstreetbets,"The indicators were all bullish. I watch MACD, MO, 9ema, 20ema, 50ema, and 200 ema, volume, and RSI. Plus most importantly the price action looked strong. A few times over the last couple of weeks AMC has had these magical perfect technical days and I pounce. I watch it very carefully and will abort mission in a heartbeat if that changes."

2021-06-16 00:18:44,wallstreetbets,Reddit mods.
2021-06-16 14:23:47,wallstreetbets,You wouldn’t want to hold that call any longer than intraday. Weeklies are far to volatile and the theta will eat you alive if you hold overnight. I always move in and out of my weeklies quickly.
2021-06-16 12:13:23,wallstreetbets,He used 120k to get that 50k so you’re a little behind the curve lol
2021-06-15 22:04:20,wallstreetbets,Amen brother amen
2021-06-16 02:11:37,wallstreetbets,Do you have any links on the gamma squeeze for AMC?
2021-06-15 21:44:10,wallstreetbets,"Scalping? It's just momentum trading on Securities already moving. You just get in and get out, and don't hold for no more than ""x"" amount of minutes at most."
2021-06-15 21:54:39,wallstreetbets,You need 25K to day trade without penalty. Fyi
2021-06-15 21:49:48,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Can you link your bank account too?
2021-06-15 21:56:09,wallstreetbets,I had no idea mint does that thanks dude!
2021-06-16 12:38:43,wallstreetbets,"Wow that’s some crazy good luck/intuition. I’m still new to options but have won some, lost some, definitely open to new advise though lol"
2021-06-16 13:13:38,wallstreetbets,Why not hold for over a year and get even more out of that bonus check?
2021-06-16 09:48:47,wallstreetbets,Ohhhhhh not a bag holder in TQQQ. That’s literally not even possibly given that it’s kissing ATH right now.
2021-06-15 21:53:28,wallstreetbets,"You can add it as a link if you want, but I’ll take your word for it.  I’ll know if I see another gain post from you that you were lying, but I don’t think you are."
2021-06-16 15:45:50,wallstreetbets,The ones showing 8 figures in cash at the bottom?

2021-06-16 15:41:12,wallstreetbets,"I can confirm this. I made an 80% profit in about two hours on 6/4 59c, that I purchased on 6/2 (AMC). My dumbass got greedy and held. It closed at $62, and opened mid-50s and I was instantly down. Even dumber, I held out, hoping it would go up and I lost 99.9%"
2021-06-16 03:58:49,wallstreetbets,"AMC gamma squeeze has to do with this coming Friday. There are currently 484,497 calls ITM and 736,319 puts OTM. If it closes above $60 another 
31,869 expire ITM. Some AMC ape put together a website to help keep track of the option chain and borrowed shares. Google ‘Stonko tracker’ 

With rules 801-005 going through Tuesday afternoon and possibly NSCC 2021-002 going through next Monday a lot of pressure should be applied to the AMC short positions. As the Friday gets closer the hope is that these MMS will hedge their bets and buy shares which puts more calls ITM which just cycles back to step 1. 

It’s a big IF still, but AMC is looking like it’s in a strong position."
2021-06-16 03:27:28,wallstreetbets,"If you search ""AMC"" in youtube, there are so many videos with great explanations. I don't want to link them here to seem like I'm advertising anyone in particular but they all have pretty good explanations of the incoming GAMMA SQUEEZE."
2021-06-15 21:49:47,wallstreetbets,What makes you get in? In the first place
2021-06-15 21:52:50,wallstreetbets,"Yes you can! And even property, such as cars and vehicles so you can track your net worth as well!"
2021-06-15 21:56:57,wallstreetbets,You’re so welcome!
2021-06-16 14:22:35,wallstreetbets,"No way - I make so much more with high frequency trading. It would be like holding off on a $50,000 check today so that I can get a $5,000 in 1 year."
2021-06-16 00:57:46,wallstreetbets,Waiting for the 179k loss screenshot
2021-06-16 08:19:39,wallstreetbets,Shorts will hold their positions because we know that losses are only temporary.
2021-06-16 06:32:08,wallstreetbets,"how many of them ITM calls are naked

if they are covered what's the point"
2021-06-16 09:31:10,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the in depth reply. I understand now. I guess we will see what the end result is.
2021-06-16 09:29:35,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info.
2021-06-16 08:20:09,wallstreetbets,Don’t listen to youtube hype.
2021-06-15 23:21:43,wallstreetbets,Sentiment is the most critical I think.....it drives IV.....you can have a stock only move 4% but if IV is up the delta will move up.... Doesn't matter if stock moved the IV did...... Extrinsic value isn't really a factor then..... These are the plays I live for... I live off the crumbs.....if you want look for a delta over 40 if this is the game you want to play...but no know your risk adversity first
2021-06-15 21:56:59,wallstreetbets,"Volume, gotta find the movers and just ride the waves up and down.

E.g. if XYZ is up 2%, and volume is coming then it's sure to keep going. Although any first sign of resistance you usually should exit the trade. 

Pull backs are inevitable, but you need to look at the technicals to see if it's consolidation for the stock to breathe and continue, or crashing. That's were looking at charts comes into play, or just watching price action.

Hard to do if you don't have day trades."

2021-06-16 07:52:20,wallstreetbets,Mods please let us see this one
2021-06-16 14:36:43,wallstreetbets,"Of course they are, but they have been acclimating and short interest rates are not friendly right now. 

Remember the average short position can be found on Ortex. AMC was 55 days. Back then the stock was under $10. 

Synthetic shares are being created through long puts to offset FTDs. 

Dark pool trading has hammered the price down when it could have pushed by 60 then who knows what comes next. It’s unforeseen territory for AMC. 

It’s a guess for anybody once it can maintain over 60"
2021-06-16 14:34:29,wallstreetbets,"None. We will never be able to ‘fully see’ the naked OT synthetic shares. 

There is some DD floating around for GME and AMC showing the dark pool trades over the last few days. I’m an idiot I don’t know how to cross link but it’s newer posts on AMC. People claim to have found how much dark pool activity there is out there currently."
2021-06-16 14:37:57,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. To me it’s not a question of if but a question of when now. 

GME should help bring along every quote on quote meme stock. I do not know their DD so I won’t try to repeat it but they are in a wild situation that should be crazier than the price action in Jan."
2021-06-15 22:04:16,wallstreetbets,"We call it ""stacking dimes"" - if your position is 1000x, and you hit a 10 cent run, that's $100; do that 10 times a day, that's a $1,000 day....."
2021-06-15 22:31:33,wallstreetbets,"Lol Im not but up an awful lot thanks to this sub amc and gme, dont worry about what Im doing, get a life little girl maybe that tampon is in too tight"
2021-06-15 22:40:02,wallstreetbets,Doesn't that amass alot of capital gains tax over time? Constantly buying and selling?
2021-06-16 14:37:58,wallstreetbets,Do you realize how high the market cap would have to be to even break $72?
2021-06-16 14:38:35,wallstreetbets,"It’s not going to maintain over $60. $64 created a double top, and now it’s heading down."
2021-06-15 22:08:46,wallstreetbets,"That's a good example, also coincides with compounding interest on small gains over time."
2021-06-15 23:21:19,wallstreetbets,“iM uP aN AwFuL LoT” lmao take your little $5 profit and go buy yourself a happy meal
2021-06-15 23:32:09,wallstreetbets,Yes but money is money
2021-06-15 23:29:48,wallstreetbets,Not if you're mostly always selling higher than you buy
2021-06-16 09:38:20,wallstreetbets,"Capital gains taxes are the same as tax on ordinary income. So it’s not a problem like what people try to scare you into believing. In his example of scalpers making $1000 per day - there’s no job in the world you would turn down that paid $1000 a day just because you had to pay taxes on the income. Don’t let fear-mongering about taxes hold you back, my friend!"
2021-06-16 15:40:15,wallstreetbets,"I hear ya. I was just trying to answer my mans question about what the whole ‘gamma squeeze’ discussion was about AMC and your question about shorts. 

I get the market cap doesn’t make sense, but does anything this yr in regards to stocks? It’s a wild yr to say the least."
2021-06-15 23:40:47,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you sound like a little jealous bitch. Move tf along"
2021-06-16 12:40:30,wallstreetbets,Ok internet tough guy lmao. You sound like hearing the truth hurts. Why don’t you go buy yourself a happy meal too 🤣

2021-06-15 21:31:04,wallstreetbets,"Bought all today around noon. Plan is to evaluate the price before jpow speaks and offload some depending on movement. Quad witching + FED should show an increase in volatility this week. 

Up $40k this week off tech calls (mostly $AMZN) which I rolled out of weeklies to slightly farther out. So this is a short term YOLO/Hedge. Account value currently sitting at around $46k"
2021-06-15 22:08:36,wallstreetbets,"Interesting tactic , let’s see how this plays out"
2021-06-15 21:24:21,wallstreetbets,"Thinking a good play is heavy on a single ATM call so it can be sold quickly on the spike in volatility. Market will then find something not so bad then rally, cuz it’s fucking crazier then your worst ex-girlfriend/boyfriend"
2021-06-15 21:25:41,wallstreetbets,I’ve got a few $30 calls w a Friday expiration.  More just playing it safe than a real position
2021-06-15 22:10:23,wallstreetbets,I thought about this couldn’t pull the trigger yet i might do a last minute entry before fed talk
2021-06-15 21:21:16,wallstreetbets,Best of luck brother! I’m at $35.13 and could really use some tendy money.

2021-06-16 00:54:54,wallstreetbets,"Idk, the options are looking kinda risky. Need at least 3-5% move to break even. I might pick up some shares, don't expect any massive moves."

So increasing revenue made them lose 616 million dollars more than the previous year.

Yeah there is nothing positive about those numbers.

If this trend continues they will be losing over a billion a year if they hit 3 billion in revenue."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Former hedge fund trader breaks down why TWNK is an insanely good value play AND speculative meme stock to ride  📷📷

**TL;DR** \- *$TWNK has great value, can be a great long-term play with steady income through buying stock only or buy-write call option strategy,* ***\*AND\**** *it's an insanely good short term speculative play because it has higher/similar short interest % than GME or AMC and trades on way less volume with an insane \~20 days for shorts to cover so it has 🚀🚀🚀 potential!*

""Guess it's impossible to post on WSB? If anyone knows how help me out. I'm not new to Reddit but I'm old (40s) and haven't used it in years so I lost my username lol.""  -Posted for user: u/TeddyPayne12

I'm a former hedge fund trader who left the business years ago to pursue a more meaningful career, aka I've been poor ever since 😂 No but for real 😭 Started trading seriously again last year when the market crashed and did fairly well. Loving this Ape era, missed GME but still holding some AMC calls!

I'm super bullish on $TWNK for 2 reasons (with a bunch of sub-reasons): because I believe in its **value** (analysis below) and it's a double play trade for **speculation**.

**1. VALUE**

there's very little downside risk in the stock, which makes it a perfect pure equity play (buy the stock)-OR-you can buy-write it all day long (buy stock and sell equivalent number of calls, so you collect the premium and make a great return PLUS you put a stop-loss order on your downside so you can't lose a penny).

*EXAMPLE OF BUY-WRITE*: TWNK closed at $16.50 last night. The July $17.50 calls were $1. If you buy 100 shares of the stock for $16.50 and sell 1 option contract at $1, you've spent $1,550 total (100 x $16.50 for stock) minus (1 x 100 x $1 for calls) = $1,550.

1. If the stock goes to $17.50 or above -- the contract will be exercised, so you'll have no position left but you'll have just made another $100, making $200 on your $1,550 which is 13% in a month(!)
2. If the stock hovers in between $16.50 and $17.50 -- you sell at whatever price it ends at, add that to your $100 from selling the calls and that's your profit -OR- you sell the next month's calls and collect more profit while the stock hovers
3. If the stock goes down then you just set a stop-loss limit order at whatever price you don't want to go below and you'll lock in profits/minimize losses (since you're protected on price down to $15.50 from selling the calls)

Regarding TWNK value, there have been some posts in the past 1 week to 4 months that did a pretty good job so I won't repeat them here but take a look then I'll tell you what I think.

1)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxinqq/hostess\_twnk\_is\_a\_sleeping\_giant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxinqq/hostess_twnk_is_a_sleeping_giant/)

3)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nz073d/hostess\_brands\_twnk\_followup\_to\_my\_long\_thesis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nz073d/hostess_brands_twnk_followup_to_my_long_thesis/)

4)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvhe4k/hostess\_is\_it\_time\_to\_go\_balls\_deep\_in\_twnk\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvhe4k/hostess_is_it_time_to_go_balls_deep_in_twnk_for/)

Here's what I'll add:

1. **Possible news TODAY**: investor meeting at Evercore ISI Consumer and Retail Summit ([webcast here](https://www.hostessbrands.com/events/event-details/evercore-isi-consumer-retail-summit))
2. It consistently beats market expectations
3. Upcoming summer season with more drivers on the road and sky high post-pandemic travel expected will boost sales, which are driven by convenience stores and through which they have a ""differentiated distribution model that gives Hostess unique access"" per Morningside analyst report
4. It has consistently beaten market expectations and added value for investors ever since it re-emerged as a \*brand new company\* after bankruptcy -- not a reorg of the old one. Per one analyst report: ""After the 2012 bankruptcy, investors purchased only the brand rights and recipes from the bankruptcy court, freeing them of employee benefits and other labor obligations that had weighed down the company in the past.""

**SPECULATION**

Above are my reasons for *investing* in $TWNK, but below are my reasons I am *trading* it right now.

If people decided this was the new meme stock, it would be a wild ride -- it's 17% shorted per the latest report (5/28) and trades on very little volume -- around a million shares a day normally with 131 million shares outstanding. By comparison, AMC traded about 5 \*million\* shares a day before all this craziness happened, with 450 million shares outstanding and 22% short interest. GME traded about 3 million shares a day on 72 million shares outstanding and 20% short interest.

Because of the volume -- it's short ratio is super high -- 20.15 as of today, which means it would take shorts 20 days to cover. That makes it about as ripe for a short squeeze as a stock can get.

**BOTTOM LINE**

Can't really find a reason why not to buy the stock, or at least buy-write it and protect yourself on the downside. If people pile into it -- we could be talking about serious money if the stock pops.

Disclosure

I am long TWNK stock and I have a covered call position worth about 5% of my portfolio, which is nothing big (\~$80k lol)

This sub never took it up for whatever reason so I sold the handful of calls I had and used that to buy 100 shares

I know high IV makes options expensive (and before wsb I would never buy a ticker with high IV) but it seems to increase realized volatility as well.

Think it's a Vega thing...

High demand for options, increases IV, tickers get pulled to the skew side(calls for memestonks) from hedging far otm options."

This stock is not a household name & it doesn't matter what the short interest is if the stock doesn't move up quickly. If it doesn't move, shorts have all the time in the world to cover & your money is tied up for a significant amount of time. People love movies & video games. We don't care about ""bakeries"". You want a snack go to AMC for some delicious popcorn. People ... don't be so gullible. AMC & GME will make you life changing money. Who cares about any other stock. Don't be that guy that passed up life changing GME & AMC money because you believed some post about a batch of cookies"
2021-06-15 20:48:11,wallstreetbets,"Umm...I don't get it. just about the whole $1500 calls thing. I'm an extremely newborned extra smooth brained ape. I suck at math, I understand options when I read about them but I never have bought them and I could probably explain the basics if you asked but I might get shit wrong. So basically I don't know shit about them and stuff. So anyways, I've just been buying stocks for like a month now. You are talking about using $1500 bucks to make like $100, and that's like...a successful thing?
I don't understand because I have about 3k grand I play with now, started with $800 a month ago. And all I do is buy like 1 or 2 stocks a day I think are gonna go up, I basically just look at if a stocks been killin it, or I go to the list of biggest movers and find the one who lost the most that I think is gonna shoot back up the next day, or you know, I just use a whole bunch of super some simple smooth brained moves and make the best pik or two I can think of and Id say I'd be pissed if I was using $1500 to just make $100 a day. I don't know maybe I'm just lucky so far is that a normal good day? 
I'm just curious because I thought I'm doing pretty good at picking em because I almost never ever am in the negative, at the end of the day Im always up 1 to 10 percent, and usually one day a week I get a jackpot day where it's over that. But what are say the best investors usual percentages like, a week? And are options really worth it because I want to learn them I'm just scurrred"

Only bought GME once day and I got like 2% out if it. I like just like to go on Wall Street Bets and talk like them with all the foul retard and autist talk. So Let's see, I've bought And hit good on Urban One a few good to great days, Uxin, Vizslink Tech, Weatherford Intl., carver Federal Savings,  IDT, some company outta China called Bit Mining, Clean Energy Fuels, TOP Ships, aaanddd that's it for the ones that did great for me. then there's 10 others that where alright.

At this point, even if a supposed ETF bubble bursts, he was straight up wrong based purely on how early he made the call.

2021-06-15 20:52:31,wallstreetbets,"Guess his put options are not paying out quickly enough so he has to add his voice hoping to move markets. Go look at the 10 year yield since 1980, it has been declining steadily to near-zero levels. Given the nature of the government debt, the Fed cannot raise interest rates and will keep them down so long as they are not concerned with high inflation (hmmm... inflation can be triggered in theory by convincing people there will be inflation, so that works for Burry as well).

Only time will tell whether Burry is right or wrong, but being right or wrong here does not mean there was a need for him to be right. How people emotionally react can be in large part the determinant in the outcome of all this. Not unlike how retail deciding to jump on AMC enabled it to raise funds and avoid bankruptcy. If people think to hoard cash and not spend it then inflation won't happen no matter how much the government prints. Inflation stays down, the Fed will keep the yields down. Yields stay down, PE ratios will increase accordingly."

Eventually each of the markets will go through some correction, that's just part of the cycle. But its meaningless if the people predicting it are saying it for several years (during with new ATHs are reached).  
It's like the people who said that Bitcoin was a bad investment back when it was wroth a fraction of a penny. And whenever it dips, they come out again to say ""see?! I was right"". Ignoring the 1,000,000x gains in between."

However these bubbles go on a long time, and if you were buying spy puts for a year you would be absolutely fucked.

2021-06-15 21:09:15,wallstreetbets,Nah.  Almost no chance they raise rates.  I'd wager that they continue to say everything is in line with estimates.  The reason it's highly anticipated is because of what they might say about the reverse repo situation.

However, it really is different this time and no one knows what will happen. Lumber prices are coming back down. Supply lines are starting to normalize. The economists who argue the inflation is temporary may have a point.

Personally I think we're heading for a period of stagflation. I think the fed very slowly - too slowly - unwinds. I think interest rates go up too little too late. The result is steadily increasing inflation and a stalled market that bounces around a plateau, never crashing but never making much headway."
2021-06-15 22:57:05,wallstreetbets,"Lumber futures have declined 14 of the last 16 days. Food prices have been lower than ever historically. Oil just crossed what it was pre pandemic. 

I don’t know much about pvc pipe taking four months to procure but I don’t think this is quite like 2008. People know there is much more money in the system, but it didn’t go to the working class and the middle class. It went mostly to rich people, who really don’t have any ability to cause mass inflation. The top 30 million earners in America are not buying up all the gasoline and chicken sandwiches."
2021-06-16 01:01:08,wallstreetbets,"Same GME, AMC prices look at PE average for the 500 and inflation is highest it’s been since  2009. The graph looks a lot like 1987 and 2008"
2021-06-16 03:23:57,wallstreetbets,"The question is never ""if a recession comes"" it's ""when a recession comes"".

I don't doubt he is not correct as anyone can see that the current market is not sustainable but it depends how far are we from a recession. Maybe you buy puts with 3 months expiration and this madness continues for another year. 

It's the same as 2008, he was right but way earlier. Had the market continued 1 or 2 years like that he would have became insolvent and would have to close his positions. He is a very smart man but luck played a big factor there."
2021-06-16 01:46:25,wallstreetbets,Does he actually publish his thesis or research anywhere publicly?

2021-06-16 12:41:38,wallstreetbets,"His reasoning is sound though. I don't necessarily believe it's a house of cards like he does, but his point is a fair one.

Say a company called Dogshit Inc (""$SHIT"") is a zombie company that most investors wouldn't touch on it's own merit. 

Now along comes Fuckbag McGee, who's been reading that it's foolish to pick stocks and that Investing in Funds is the safe way to get rich like Warren Buffet. Fuckbag McGee pours a bunch of his money into a handful of ETFs. Little does he know that three of the ETFs include $SHIT... so he's actually buying $SHIT.

So Burry's criticism is that ETFs allow bad stocks to be ""packaged"" with good stocks, and seemingly diversified and low-risk -- and investors are discounting how large the downside can be a in a market correction."

I doesn't take a mad genius to see a lot of valuations are borderline crazy. But in all honestly, except for TSLA, looking at the S&P 500 25 biggest companies I could make a strong case to explain their valuation by the expectation of low rates for a forseeable future and a business model that is so different from what we saw in the past from huge companies."

Part of disruption to the supply chain is that people are able to afford more than they ever have before because of getting some extra cash and these low rates. Banks are willing to lend out the money because the underwriting works out. 

My question is… what is going to happen when that stops? Buying will stop & consumer spending will go down.. Is that going to lead to a massive crash? Will it curb inflationary prices? No one knows but all the scenarios are on the table. 

Like you said, the feds doing something now is too little too late. The damage is done."

I hate it for some people, but I absolutely hope housing a massive correction. My area used to be cheap (South Eastern US) It has been a runaway train of increasing prices for basic cookie cutter houses and custom. People are laying a ridiculous mark up, that is affecting other people. I hope they get their asses burned like 08."

We'll see, but Burry's favorite history lessons line up pretty well with the devaluation, as do the attitudes.

Now you need to only be down XXX dollars down 50% which is 110, so if you have a lot of downside risk you might be forced to buy 100 strike puts to fix your down 50% risk even though you think they are worthless.

(unlike his big short that made him famous, which for him was a little like simply opening a door he not only heard opportunity pounding on, but in a way suggesting he was the only one seeing the hinges we're about to fall off in the process)

2021-06-15 22:35:51,wallstreetbets,"I'll try a simple explanation based on my understanding.  The banks have a lot of reserves (cash) that they lose money on when it just sits around.  They'd rather have it in treasuries that they can use as collateral.  Meanwhile there's lots of things going on like hedging around CPI, tomorrow's Fed meeting, and next week's Russell rebalance.  So banks need the short term treasury bills to use as collateral for all this business.  Except the Fed already bought tons of it from QE.  

So the Fed set up a reverse repo facility where banks can park their cash in exchange for collateral to keep the liquidity moving.  The amount being parked in the repo facility keeps increasing.  This is fueling speculation that the Fed will have to do something.  Perhaps by changing the rate administered at the repo facility."

And now the problem with rising rates is the same for the nation as rising variable rates for high balance credit card holders- at some point all they're able to afford is the Vig- no new hats, no road trips, no groceries, no ammo. Nada.
Just interest payments. 

Experiment with the current US debt obligations, revenues, and interest rates sometime. Then take a look at the federal budget, see if you can figure out how all that works if we ever, got back to 7 or10 percent, much less some drastic hyperinflation measure like 18.

Typically I am locked into contract pricing for 1 year and know fairly close to what I’ll pay per linear foot or per fitting. This year I was told all contract pricing can’t be held because of supply shortages for the plastic resin due to the storms that hit the US as well as the typical Covid-19 supply issues. 

What a nightmare this has created finishing jobs that were tendered in 2018 and 2019 when Steel and PVC were stable and much cheaper. We’re stuck holding the bag on material because I’m purchasing in 2021 for a building contract that reflects 2018/2019 pricing."

2021-06-15 23:20:55,wallstreetbets,"I’m not arguing with you about the price of wire or what builders can finish. But I think most of this is a temporary disruption due to the pandemic, and not some zimbabwe style inflation. Burry was calling a pop in the bubble pre covid. 

Personally, here is my theoretical view. Inflation is caused by increased money chasing more goods. So people point to the fed’s printing as a result of the cost increases we see. But if you look at how much the fed printed with how much richer billionaires got, you don’t see too much difference. 

However- if you recall the US economy was nearly 80% a serviced based economy, and for at least three months last year almost all services almost all stopped, it reasons that a whole bunch of consumers could only spend on goods- that is to say all consumers were trying to purchase the 20% of the economy that is based mostly on goods. (These aren’t hard and fast numbers but please just go along with me- there is a huge imbalance.) 

As consumers have other ways to spend their money, in addition to supply disruptions fixing themselves, people’s one time renovations of their home offices finish, etc- I don’t see many of the inflation issues remaining. 

Certain sectors of the economy might see inflation as waitstaff or childcare or whatever becomes more expensive, but I don’t see this as the catalyst for a crash. 

I would be much more concerned about a few hedge funds dealing in meme stocks causing margin calls, which cause a liquidation, which causes more of a sell off. See the recent Archegos Bill Huang for that black swan event."

When the shareholders refuse more offerings what's next how will they manage the deficit they have 40% more debt than when the lost money in 2019 I just don't see any ability to survive 2022 there's no plan and it's genuinely not that far away reopening isn't gonna save them by it self they gonna capitalize on it somehow.

2021-06-16 05:50:57,wallstreetbets,The challenge is knowing when to pull the plug
2021-06-16 12:51:35,wallstreetbets,"Don't matter.  I can be early and still be right as long as it does end up happening, right?"
2021-06-16 15:12:53,wallstreetbets,"Why would someone expect rates to go up by more than 1% over the next three years. Can signals from the fed be any clearer?

At this point inflation over the target if wages follow even slightly is a godsend to lower real debt levels of business. If inflation spins out of control there is still a sliver lining for companies that are leveraged and could benefit from higher prices of the goods and services they sell.

Only retired boomers with unindexed pensions and big cash piles would be in danger.

Deflation is the common enemy here for most govts and at least 75% of the population. I just don't see a scenario where rates go back over 2.5% in the next 15 years without hyperinflation taking some countries by surprise. Either way, quality equities trumps cash and bonds.

On the other hand, I see a scenario where unemployment lags, city centres don't recover from the pandemic as quickly as we think, commercial real estate keeps hurting  and Landlords need cash for repurposing. The govs invest massively in infrastructure and greening to create jobs and facilitate recovery while inflation is well under control under 3%. Or worst, another wave or household debt gets out of control and another bailout is needed or yields need to go negative as they did elsewhere...

I think the last scenarios are kind of priced in and I'd avoid a lot of equities in the current market, but I don't buy the big crash scenario purely based on valuation fundamentals."
2021-06-16 12:27:05,wallstreetbets,"Everyone on WSB knows options can be bought a max of 1 month out, ergo given Burry was saying this more than one month before TSLA fell, he must have lost money. Duh."

2021-06-15 22:53:33,wallstreetbets,Ha! Now there’s a name I haven’t heard in a minute.
2021-06-16 14:50:30,wallstreetbets,It's him an Mohamed El-Erian for me. I listened to him screaming about how the economy was going to collapse any minute for years during the 2010s. I can't take him seriously after he has been wrong so consistently for so many years now. But I do agree that we should take Michael Burry seriously and look into what he's saying.
2021-06-16 08:06:20,wallstreetbets,We should probably relax using one years worth gains to measure the individual. I could easily make Burry look like a retard and Kathy a genius by showing her gain in 2020 vs Burry's.
2021-06-16 07:58:32,wallstreetbets,That number under management mostly isn’t trading gains. It’s inflows from investors.
2021-06-15 21:00:06,wallstreetbets,Being early is equivalent to being wrong.

not right?"
2021-06-16 05:36:23,wallstreetbets,"If early counts as correct, when does he get to be wrong?"
2021-06-15 20:59:04,wallstreetbets,"Probably.
I’m all seriousness, he’s probably right. But I’m trying buy garbage options with short term DTE. I bought some puts last week and my girlfriend broke up with me. I don’t have enough $$$ to sit on LEAPs waiting for this shit to dip."
2021-06-15 22:44:47,wallstreetbets,"Right on, thank you. Messy times lol"
2021-06-15 23:43:44,wallstreetbets,Except they can buy short term bonds/loans and wait for interest rates to go up. Kinda like JPM just said they were doing.

2021-06-16 03:18:44,wallstreetbets,Altho i do think we will see a little inflation from permanent wage increases its not like this major commodities shortage like some these inflation bears make it out to be
2021-06-16 10:32:20,wallstreetbets,"Lol, the unsplitable stock."
2021-06-15 23:47:22,wallstreetbets,Nah. I have OLN shares and leaps.
2021-06-16 10:08:16,wallstreetbets,Surely a contract on pricing makes that not your problem.
2021-06-15 23:36:40,wallstreetbets,"I can definitely see what you are talking about. I can't say that these issues will cause inflation directly maybe even at all but I do see businesses scaling back due to these issues, not to mention all the businesses that had to close their doors due to the pandemic. I only hope and pray we are able to stabilize sometime soon. The more people lose jobs the harder it is to get products, pay bills etc etc kinda like a domino effect. 

What you said does make alot of sense I only hope the snowball our lovely politicians started with pandemic pullback in every sector besides Healthcare doesn't force a massive issue across al sectors and we are able to recover. I pray for those lost in the world that only know the 9-5 grind with no other means of financial security. I think its going to be a long road to full recovery and just hope it isn't too late. Only time will tell my friend. Wish I had that magic ball so I could make all the right plays"
2021-06-16 03:16:40,wallstreetbets,"Yea there isnt a supply shortage due to prermanent supply issues, supply will easily get up to par w demand its just gona take a little bit cuz we literally TURNED EVERYTHING OFF. Aside from that we have huge deflationary forces incoming from tech automations in software n hardware robots n shit ai n shit i want to bet on the future right here."
2021-06-16 05:42:46,wallstreetbets,People have been saying inflation is temporary for a while now.  It's getting harder and harder to believe that.  Something keeps going wrong and prices continue to shoot higher.  What's happening?  I don't think anyone fully knows but there are forces at work here that are driving these prices higher and the assumption that next month we'll finally catch up to it is becoming less and less realistic.
2021-06-16 01:30:51,wallstreetbets,He wasn’t shorting the bubble pre Covid he has shown better %gains than Kathy Woods. He has made more during the pandemic than off the housing bubble. Inflation hit 6.8 today
2021-06-16 09:11:28,wallstreetbets,"I agree. They can’t let it continue to rise much longer. The best tool they have to bring it down is interest rates.

I can’t imagine the formula to calculate inflation being changed again."

2021-06-16 00:51:25,wallstreetbets,Burry asking banks how to short bonds is the reason CDS were created. He literally got Wall street to invent a new financial instrument.
2021-06-15 22:54:41,wallstreetbets,"As we move closer to Texas and Berlin opening (and seeing if the Cybertruck is a success) and, especially, if there are any positive developments on the 4680 front you will probably find the stock is going to head upwards. If FSD moves along then that is another whole story and the stock would probably gain a trillion or two in market cap overnight for that, but not many are expecting much movement there for the next couple of years."
2021-06-16 10:34:54,wallstreetbets,"Yes normally a lot of us drink fresh water that comes from the snowpack that falls in the mountains as a result of that evaporation.

2021-06-16 13:13:55,wallstreetbets,"The underlying conditions that created 2008 have simply been printed over (initial bailouts, followed by the fed balance sheet buying mortgage backed securities and negative interest rates). Structurally this comment is correct and the question is when the bubble pops, not if. The monetary acceleration in 2020 is unprecedented and asset inflation is observed everywhere. This is a medium and long term threat to both macroeconomics (inflation particularly) and microeconomics (household wealth, inequality, access, etc) 

I only have a masters in economics though so I might not understand how markets work either"

2021-06-16 14:38:15,wallstreetbets,"if his puts were long, then yea he made money, but not a lot, it was probably on IV, and if he is still in the position then I dont think he did at all. He actually got puts somewhere in the 600's or late 500's."
2021-06-16 14:14:33,wallstreetbets,what are you talking about you retard?

2021-06-15 23:19:04,wallstreetbets,Timing a crash is like timing a peak you'll never be able to do it perfectly but unlike timing a peak being early isn't gonna make you lose out on potential gain all you lose in being early betting on a crash is extra premium and borrow fees. It's far better to be early than to wait till it's happening.
2021-06-15 23:50:54,wallstreetbets,"Right, but the whole problem is they are kind of in demand.  JPM can snatch up all the collateral they need.  Just keep them instead of providing liquidity.  So what happens to the smaller banks?  Hence the fed's reverse repo facility.

2021-06-16 10:53:10,wallstreetbets,"Dude, the banks were definitely part of the problem. They were taking on riskier and riskier shit because they were being greedy and wanted all of the high priced mortgages that they could get.. because ""who doesn't pay their mortgage?"" They definitely viewed it as 'free money'. 

The underwriting of single family mortgages is much, much better than it was 15-20 years ago. I've spoken with many senior level bankers that told me the regulations surrounding mortgage lending are much stricter now and I deal with it on a daily basis at my job. 

Still, I do believe a lot of people are getting into overpriced mortgages that they will be stuck with for years because the resale value of their home will be less than when they initially purchased it. The good thing is that this time around, the underwriting on performance is much better. The bad thing is that... what if 10% of the country loses their job?"
2021-06-15 23:10:59,wallstreetbets,That's....a horrible bet. I wanna wait 2 years to maybe double my money if a skyrocketing $60 stock drops to a dollar or nothing? You belong with the retards but on the opposite end of the spectrum

They have no way to raise money, they can't get more loans they only have 70 mil more of assets than debt. They lost money in 2019 they not gonna magically make money once things open up. $2 billion is enough to prevent bankruptcy this year it's not enough to prevent bankruptcy next year."

If they were authorized to sell 200 mil more shares their debt would be gone and they would be saved but it's not gonna happen with who's currently holding.
2021-06-16 10:27:29,wallstreetbets,"It really depends how bad inflation gets and how bad the upcoming market crash is. Two things are for sure though: it's bad to hold cash when it's going down in value, and it's bad to own stocks when they're going down in value. The real play is to buy assets that increase in value or at least reliably hold their value in uncertain times. Precious metals and real estate are obvious choices.

I think stocks with very solid fundamentals in high growth sectors are a good choice, even if their value dips following a crash, which is why I've invested heavily in $INTC (but I'm retarded so this could be a terrible play). Stocks like $MCD are probably safe, and there's always inverse ETFs for the risk takers. Speculative/meme stocks without intrinsic value are the absolute worst choice, just like they were in the dot com bubble."

2021-06-16 13:53:42,wallstreetbets,"> $110k a year qualify for a $1.2mil loan recently. (Bay area) They act like its a great thing and they think they can afford it but when you factor in tax and hoa its like 80+% of their monthly income. 

I have a hard time believing that because regulations force banks to cap Debt-to-Income ratio at 49ish%. And that typically is only if you qualify for FHA. 

At 1.2M, your P&I mortgage payment is ~4.9k/month. That is over 50% of their gross income not including escrow taxes and insurance. The only way that this would pass underwriting is if they had a spouse making similar income and had little debt outside of their mortgage. You also have to factor in that the borrowers must meet rigorous employment checks, 2+ years of income verification, and years of steady job employment. 

The couple making 18% of their houses value in yearly income and having little outside debt isn't the problem. 

What scares me are big investors coming in and scooping up real estate (which is happening around the globe) and driving up real estate values to unstable levels, pricing out the Lower/Middle class, drying up home building/purchasing, and causing housing values to plummet which sticks the couple above with a $1.2M mortgage and a house only worth $700K."

2021-06-16 00:15:03,wallstreetbets,I'd definitely agree with that it's not a safe play but it's a possible one I'm a pretty smooth brain but if you did it right when then went bankrupt I think you can just sell the puts for max money but it's never a great bet going against apes
2021-06-16 11:30:05,wallstreetbets,"A bit of both. You can buy shares in gold ETFs, or you can buy physical gold and have a company hold it for you in a secure storage facility (or you can store it in your own safe if you're a doomer)."
2021-06-16 05:48:17,wallstreetbets,Lol... I have given up on trying to time when it will finally go down. My best bet would be when the government stops with stimulus payments and retail money dries up. As long as the government is giving money to people who refuse to invest based on fundamentals and instead do it all based on whatever this is called I am not sure this is ending.

IMO Burns was targeted because of his relationship with the prior administration. Yes, he might have been awful, but given different circumstances, we may not have known, different pressures and all... 

IMO this sets the stage for Workhorse and Lordstown motors to be the media’s new darling.  

Tim Ryan, the congressman from Ohio and a favorite to win the Senate seat, said WKHS was on the cusp of winning the USPS contract, then surprise, it goes to Oshkosh. But now, DeJoy looks to be heading the way of Burns and the contract award to Oshkosh continues to raise eyebrows. 

Today it was made clear the Lordstown plant is tooled to build the Endurance and they’re on schedule to hit limited production this year. The other important point is the Endurance and the WKHS USPS NGDV are built on the same platform. This was the plan all along. 

Final point. The USPS needed new vehicles 15 years ago. If they’re going electric where are they going to get them anytime soon..

That’d be CLOV $28 to $13.50 in a week. Volume 600k down to 300k next day down to 80k then 50k... 

WKHS meanwhile topped out around 60k volume now we’re around 30k, not ideal but if we are talking about bagholders there’s endless other (more popular even) stocks that have apes bagholding hard"

2021-06-15 21:42:20,wallstreetbets,I assume this would be consumer vehicles which is bad news for RIDE but agnostic for WKHS because they are in the commercial vehicle space?

Everyone on WSB can see this. They can see how it's other WKHS bots and shills trying to hype this up. They can tell that you don't have any knowledge beyond ""hype"". 

This is why WKHS constantly gets pulled from the sub. 

Literally trying to have a conversation about the topic with OP, as are others and all he can reply with is stuff like this. Lame."

It’s my understanding the reason GM practically gave RIDE the plant was because of the mail truck contract. Then the election happened.. From that point everything went south. 

I suspect now that the image (Burns) is gone the train is back on track."

If you haven’t tried psychedelics yet..I get it. Why would you invest.

If you have tried though..no more words needed. You are probably invested already.

So here I am, a simple Ape. Asking for your sincere attention. I’m no financial advisor, nor am I anything close to being clever. All I know is, MINDMED changed my life and can change yours too!
So I invite you to ride that train with me. Invest in movie theaters. Invest in great computer shops.
But don’t forget to invest into the next big thing.
MMED IS the next big thing. If you don’t believe me come back here in 1 year. You’ll thank me then.

2021-06-16 08:18:03,wallstreetbets,Totally agree. I mean we’ve been at this place  before. Just continuing the positive studies of the last century.
2021-06-15 20:46:56,wallstreetbets,Haha Cramer you forgot to change accounts again!
2021-06-15 20:53:12,wallstreetbets,Why not Mars?;)🚀
2021-06-15 21:07:45,wallstreetbets,Legend!
2021-06-16 03:37:57,wallstreetbets,Yes! Hyped!
2021-06-15 20:16:11,wallstreetbets,Yes. But don’t fuck on psychedelics. You will never wanna fuck without again in your life.
2021-06-15 20:02:39,wallstreetbets,But have you tried picking a stock while on psychedelics? Welcome to the cause.
2021-06-15 20:24:12,wallstreetbets,$WOOF ??? I'm fucked aren't i?
2021-06-15 21:29:06,wallstreetbets,Four Roses Single Barrel. I usually drink a little while tripping but not sure on your connection there?
2021-06-15 20:26:34,wallstreetbets,"No worries, its gonna be above 6 .... personally I am always looking to grab more when it breaks under 3.20"
2021-06-15 20:22:10,wallstreetbets,In since .34 - never selling.
2021-06-16 01:22:00,wallstreetbets,So you skipped all the days it was at $3?
2021-06-15 20:29:28,wallstreetbets,I honestly want to trip balls one time but I got kids so that’s damn near impossible. Finding the time and fighting with my conscience whether it’s responsible or not. Last time I tripped I was in my teens and I watched pumpkin head....walls were breathing little girls were calling my name in the distance....yeah.
2021-06-15 20:49:25,wallstreetbets,You on psychedelics? Welcome to the cause🚀
2021-06-15 21:14:58,wallstreetbets,It took a good month for regular sex to be okay again. Shit is next level!
2021-06-15 20:23:54,wallstreetbets,Can confirm
2021-06-15 20:11:33,wallstreetbets,I have gotten my largest profits on trades I made while smoking weed
2021-06-15 21:33:32,wallstreetbets,A little whisky gets your trip going. All I’m saying.
2021-06-15 20:38:40,wallstreetbets,"Same here, I get excited when it approaches buy zone. 2500 shares at $3.78(Canadian dollars)."
2021-06-16 02:40:14,wallstreetbets,Not everyone has money readily available mate.
2021-06-16 14:24:25,wallstreetbets,I bought after they IPOed with nasdaq which was its all time high. Unfortunately didn’t have enough to avg down at $3 . But thankfully I have other winnings now and can invest more
2021-06-15 21:02:57,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't recommend tripping with your kids around, especially if your mindset is like this but is you can find a weekend babysitter or something and you set it up responsibly then I think you should do it."
2021-06-15 20:32:47,wallstreetbets,"Let your kids grow up. Let them move out. Enjoy your trip. Until then…invest in psychedelics.
Just my two cents!"
2021-06-15 20:46:27,wallstreetbets,"Theres always an inherent risk of some psychological trauma if a trip doesnt go your way. Its not something id risk if I had kids to worry about. You dont want to get your wires crossed and eek out for a month or two to recover. That shit works both ways. Psychedelics can help people overcome anxiety and all that good stuff, but they can cause all those same problems too. A very bad trip can fuck up your whole world."
2021-06-15 20:55:26,wallstreetbets,You commented on your own post congratulating yourself and I'm on drugs. Get some help Jimmy
2021-06-15 20:48:01,wallstreetbets,(He's ALWAYS smoking weed)
2021-06-15 20:14:13,wallstreetbets,That’s the spirit!
2021-06-15 21:12:37,wallstreetbets,"Oh most definitely, most people think we’re irresponsible when it comes to shit like this but there is a lot more thought that goes into it. Even the idea of tripping over night doesn’t sit well cause I understand I have responsibilities as a parent. Getting up early after a trip doesn’t sound fun. One day, one day I will trip but until then micro dosing does me perfect."
2021-06-15 20:51:03,wallstreetbets,True words. Exactly what I’m saying. Invest for the right people. Let them heal..
2021-06-15 21:15:56,wallstreetbets,I’ve been around the block a while and I agree with BB. When it comes to situation like that it involves a much harder substance than psilocybin. You would most likely get sick and throw up before you got to that point on shrooms. Massive amounts of acid maybe but shrooms no.
2021-06-15 20:59:12,wallstreetbets,"No there isn't. Stop spreading FUD like that. 

Nobody has ever ""eek out for a month or two"" because they ate some mushrooms. 

Going on a multi-drug fueled week long bender it may be a possibility to throw you out of sync but not with a responsible mushroom trip every once in a while."
2021-06-16 04:03:33,wallstreetbets,"If you have a bad trip it’s because you’re not confronting the bad within. The trip just allows you to see what your ego doesn’t want you to. 

Feel like I should dramatically blow some sort of dust into a fire and drift into the night now.."
2021-06-15 20:56:41,wallstreetbets,"Brother, I like you."
2021-06-15 21:40:48,wallstreetbets,"I personally have tripped overnight with children in bed. I couldn't have done it without my wife being there sober and sleeping as well. But as for the next day, it was some of the most fun I've ever had with my son. He was about 2 years old. Ive done smaller doses around my children as well and have had no issues. But set and setting is king. I would never do it if i felt my head wasn't in the right place. Maybe a sober friend is the answer in case kid(s) wake up. Just a thought."
2021-06-15 22:25:05,wallstreetbets,Go with the mushrooms!
2021-06-15 21:21:00,wallstreetbets,"Bullshit man. You hear it everyday how ""the first time i did shrooms changed my life"". Blah blah blah. Its been uttered that psychedelics are lifechanging like a billion times in this thread.

 If shrooms can facilitate an intense enough experience to be one of the best nights of your life, it is equally capable of causing the most terrifying and horrible night of your life too. And when people experience that kind of mental trauma it causes problems."
2021-06-15 21:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Youre incorrect.

Bad trips can CAUSE ptsd, depression, agorophobia, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder etc. A bad experience with psychedelics can cause all of the same problems as any other severe emotional/mental trauma like war, an accident, near death experience, etc."
2021-06-15 21:47:12,wallstreetbets,"See the thing is tho the stories you hear are over exaggerated. You can have a bad trip on shrooms but at most 8 hours and that’s depending on how much you ate. There are safeguards you put in place to keep from having bad trips like not tripping around shitty people. 

The main thing when it comes to shroom stocks is this, they aren’t feeding you handfuls of shrooms it’s a micro dosing, which if you educate yourself on the subject you would see the benefits. Yeah a half ounce of shrooms might make a bad trip but why the fuck are you eating that much in the first place. There is much worse out there that is prescribed to us, ever take a Xanax? I call them little blue forget me nots cause I can’t remember shit if I take them."
2021-06-15 23:15:22,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm, bad trips can stay with you for a verrrryyy long time, but so can the good ones🙂🙃🙂🙃"
2021-06-15 21:05:55,wallstreetbets,No I'm not but you believe whatever you want.
2021-06-16 04:32:54,wallstreetbets,Heres a safeguard.  Dont sit around with your buddy and eat half an ounce of shrooms and watch Event Horizon.
2021-06-15 21:53:55,wallstreetbets,"Of course ive taken xans. Ive taken everything. Thats how i know what im talking about. (Also, why are you taking blues? A blue is like half a bar. Stick with the .5mg oranges or break the blues in half)

This stupid argument started when I gave a father the advice to not do psychedelics while he has young kids, because he has too much responsibility to risk having to unwind and recover for a few months if he happens to have a really negative experience. 

This conversation isnt even about the stocks, its one guy trying to argue that shrooms are so great its impossible for them to ever cause any negative mental or emotional trauma. Which is not fucking true. People get shook all the fucking time from bad trips."
2021-06-15 23:25:56,wallstreetbets,"Thats all I been sayin man. These drugs can give you a more positive experience than you could ever achieve without chemicals, but they can give you an equally off the charts bad experience too. And experiences of that magnitude can affect everyday life afterwords. It swings both ways."
2021-06-15 21:07:34,wallstreetbets,"Its well documented, and also well known by anybody who dabbles into drug culture. If youve never heard about a bad trip potentially rocking your world youve obviously never done this stuff, that or youre hanging out with alot of ignorant people that probably shouldnt be doing drugs in the first place if theyre not aware of this kinda thing.

Why do you think treatment is done with a mental health professional present? Its not like medication you can send someone home with 5g of gold caps and tell em to have fun. The experience has to be guided with careful supervision and professional direction to avoid a negative experience that might make their condition worse."
2021-06-15 21:16:47,wallstreetbets,"Show me something documented. Lol

Me and my people haven't dabbled in drug culture. We are drug culture. 

And yes I know people that have had bad trips but those are the best ones to learn from and there are never lingering effects weeks later unless you're too dense to learn the lessons you were being shown.

I am just talking about mushrooms though. Dirty processed drugs and research chemicals can be a whole different story."
2021-06-15 21:23:03,wallstreetbets,"I hear what your saying and I think your both somewhat right, but I don't think your considering people with pre existing mental illnesses. Psychedelics in any form can and have exacerbated those illnesses. You are correct for the most part when saying the ""bad trips are the best to learn from"", but to say ""unless your too dense to learn the lessons you were being shown"" is niave. I think you are correct 99% of the time, but to say there's never a long term bad mental reaction is a bit reckless imo.

Edit: Also lol'd @ ""we are drug culture"". ✊"
2021-06-15 21:25:17,wallstreetbets,"""never lingering effects weeks later unless you're too dense to learn the lessons you were being shown.""

Sounds like you agree with me. They can cause lasting problems. You said it yourself. I mean, you tried to blame the victim or whatever, but you admit this stuff can cause lasting issues."
2021-06-15 21:38:26,wallstreetbets,"No I'm not agreeing with you as all my responses are based off your original statement where you said someone could get their ""wires crossed and eek out for a week or two"" as that implies their wires weren't crossed before they decided to eat mushrooms. 

Mushrooms have never broken a non-broken person and they have healed millions of people, with or without professional supervision."
2021-06-15 22:02:08,wallstreetbets,"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2116618-psychedelic-sanctuary-will-help-drug-users-get-over-bad-trips/

Theres treament centers specifically for helping people cope with problems caused by psychedelics. 

I get that you enjoy your drugs, but its immature and ignorant to pretend theyre great for everybody and can never do any harm.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7034876/"
2021-06-15 22:09:31,wallstreetbets,"""Many people who use psychedelics are not looking to be cured, but instead seek help making sense of their trips, which can sometimes fundamentally challenge how they see the world.""

These people don't have problems caused by psychedelics, they have problems being too attached to the matrix and too dense to learn the lessons they were being shown in their ""bad trips"". Lol"
2021-06-15 22:16:01,wallstreetbets,"Occhams Razor son:  
Psychedelics fuck with your psyche. Thats whats fun about them.

Fucking with your psyche doesnt always produce a positive outcome for everybody every time.

The end."

2021-06-16 07:41:17,wallstreetbets,"CLOV is not the way. Short interest is not high enough and the stock is too liquid to have a real short squeeze. A gamma squeeze MAYBE if enough people buy OTM calls. But with momentum to the downside, I don’t know if that will happen. AMC and GME are the plays based on market dynamics, and UWMC and WISH are the plays based on fundamentals."

2021-06-16 04:47:28,wallstreetbets,"Buying shares initially moves the price but as options come in or near the money market makers start buying shares to hedge the option. If price falls them they sell the shares that they are holding to remain neutral.

It's why stocks with large options chains will suddenly jump or drop in price once certain options come into or out of play.

$CLOV looks like it can easily jump from 16 to 18 to 20 and 22 and beyond as most of those call options shares have not been purchased yet."

2021-06-16 07:45:55,wallstreetbets,I’m talking about facts. 3x more short interest than AMC. You’re obviously a bag holding idiot with your ass in your head.
2021-06-16 07:43:54,wallstreetbets,"Not quite. The calls expiring ITM doesn’t mean someone has to go out into the open market and buy at market price. Most of those calls are already covered by people who have those shares in their portfolio. If someone sold naked calls, they will indeed have to buy at market price and then deliver shares at the strike, in which case the stock would rise from the excessive buying. That doesn’t mean you have 100,000,000 shares that ALL need to get purchased on the open market."
2021-06-16 08:59:18,wallstreetbets,Just about all stocks have some options in the money.

2021-06-15 22:17:31,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure you are. That's why it's a terrible idea for anyone to buy AMC now. You don't buy the highs. AMC has never been higher. I don't understand why people go in threads and bash other people's stocks. This is supposed to be redditors banding together and fighting crooked short sellers.

Edit: So there’s like 2800 on the NYSE and 3300 on the NASDAQ. That’s at least like, more than one chance to win. So clearly by the rules of maths, if at least one goes up you can’t be a loser. Also, one too many bourbons and forgot ETFs existed. 

TL;DR Buying Puts on VTSAX tomorrow because I think I’m the next Michael Buble and some people just like to watch the world burn."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"VZIO vs ROKU Roku has a $41.6 billion market capitalization, but analysts forecast sales will hit $2.56 billion this year. That means ROKU stock is at 16.25 times sales. That would even be high for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rather than a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple.

Compare that with Vizio, which now has a $4.84 billion market value. Analysts foresee $2.17 billion in sales this year, or just 15% less than Roku. However, its P/S ratio is just 2.23 times that estimated revenue. That means Roku has just 15% more revenue but is 7.29 times more expensive (i.e., 16.25 divided by 2.23).

Vizio’s Platform Plus business, which consists of selling advertising and data, had a gross profit of $38.4 million, more than double the $15.2 million profit it rang up a year ago. Revenues rose 120% to $52.2 million. 

SmartCast active accounts grew 57% to 13.4 million. Time spent streaming SmartCast content rose 70% to more than 3.6 billion. Average revenue per user increased 76% to $14.52. The growth in ARPU was driven by higher advertising revenue, the company said."

Vizio P/E ratio: 4.7

This is a no brainer!"
2021-06-16 04:05:14,wallstreetbets,Earnings: it’s 50% less profit margins & earnings than Roku.. compound that over 3 yrs that’s why market cap for Roku is much higher .. btw: where is vizio website.. it seems diverts to another that is linked to DCC an U.K. Ftse company?
2021-06-15 22:29:13,wallstreetbets,Don’t you think it would have already been priced in the stock price?
2021-06-16 03:47:11,wallstreetbets,"So true, 4 sticks..genius never fail me.  Brought TV, good but not 100% like sticks.. problem is they license Roku platform to other TV manufacturers, so have to navigate their software . When they genuinely build their own TV from scratch I’ll buy!"
2021-06-16 04:45:33,wallstreetbets,I did that yesterday... Exactly at the peak.
2021-06-16 10:51:37,wallstreetbets,Or license it to a company like LG or Samsung that use terrible proprietary operating systems only Sony has figured out that paying a licensing fee for android tv is worth it for an above average user experience though still not as intuitive as Rokus
2021-06-16 06:44:55,wallstreetbets,"It takes very little volume to move VZIO, which all the sudden volume that’s how it went up so quickly. As long as you didn’t buy calls expiring Friday.. I believe you can still make $. Since yesterday picked up traction, I am hoping we get some nice volume again today. Good luck ✨"
2021-06-15 22:40:02,wallstreetbets,"I feel like ROKU took market share away from vizio so they tried to imitate ROKU. Either way ROKU has the majority market share. I agree Vizio is low, but I’d rather have ROKU."
2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AMC - Another pretty day for the apes Just want to show you another perspective of metrics for $AMC that ordinary trader can't see from close up!

I detected that AMC has been actively growing from the perspective of [website’s traffic](https://contora.ai/ticker/amc#website_traffic) and a number of [open job positions](https://contora.ai/ticker/amc#job_openings) recently. Perhaps they are actively expanding their staff - almost 2.5K new open positions with a staff of 5K employees - this is quite a big turnover.

[$AMC job positions](https://preview.redd.it/fngs06s0ai571.png?width=2180&format=png&auto=webp&s=aab95c823f3c350cdb4d77f5c1468b74a40c0cea)

Also, the traffic to the $AMC website has [doubled](https://contora.ai/ticker/amc#website_traffic) over the past 4 months! Considering that the website is one of their biggest sales channels - it's a brilliant indicator and we will see great profit figures in the report for the second quarter.

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WISH vs. UWMC: Do you like money? **Disclaimer: I am extremely biased, but I tell no lies. I just want you to make money**

If my goal was to make money, I would not yolo into WISH. It has a cool ticker name, I'll give it that, but after I've watched WSB pour more money into this stock than I've ever seen in such a short timespan, it still has barely moved, and the facts say UWMC will make you more money. Why?

**1) Float size:** WISH share float is around 338 million shares. Comparatively, UWMC is around 80m. WISH is 4x harder to move.


**2) Dilution:** IF WISH does rise again, they will keep dropping offerings on our heads. The UWMC CEO has already stated that he believes the company is **undervalued** and they have a share buyback program, there will be no dilution to stop the party.


**3) Option chain:** Most of UWMC's options are ITM or ATM, whereas most of WISH's call options are OTM. This means that the closer we get to friday at the current price, the more buying pressure UWMC will have and the less WISH will have due to the difference in options that need to be hedged for. This is extremely important and combined with float size is a large reason why UWMC is such a good play for this week. Every day at open the stock is assaulted by shorts because they don't want the $10 calls to stay ITM, but with more volume this stock would **explode**.

**4) IV:** Not only is the UWMC float smaller making it easier to move, but it has more ITM options at play magnifying that effect. IV is also lower on UWMC (100% vs 250%) making options cheaper by a VERY significant amount, increasing the probability of a very popular well known technical event.


**TLDR;** Smooth brain apes keep yoloing into WISH despite the facts working against them, when there is a much more lucrative play at hand. 


Also I am not emotionally attached to any stock and have nothing against our chad RKT holders, but I think short term this is just a better technical setup.

**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**"
2021-06-15 20:06:53,wallstreetbets,"I like money. I wish I had more. If Uwmc prints me some, I will."
2021-06-15 20:20:50,wallstreetbets,I got 1000 UWMC and 190 WISH. So I am rooting for both also.
2021-06-15 20:11:57,wallstreetbets,If UWMC doesn’t get up above 10$ by Friday I’m not going to be able to buy any more stock in either for a while because i may need a divorce attorney 🤬

2021-06-15 21:02:11,wallstreetbets,"I have heard nothing but positive about UWMC and it isnt running.Dividend, making profit, high short interest, joining Russell, buying back program. Am i missing anything? Is it because its not a tech company?"
2021-06-15 20:22:49,wallstreetbets,"It’s very simple. Buy #UWMC shares, less options - we then moon. Everyone knows the value of the stock, can outgrow its competitors especially RKT, and could potentially squeeze. But no one is buying shares. 

Everyone wants quick money but only bids options. If everyone buys shares this could easily moon. No doubt. Stop being greedy and stick to base!! 🚀🌗"
2021-06-15 20:26:48,wallstreetbets,"and if there is a gamma squeeze this week, there is even more buying fuel to add to the fire for the following reasons:

2021-06-15 21:31:23,wallstreetbets,"I rode the wish wave last Monday, but I feel like that ship has already sailed.  Uwmc has yet to rally and is perfectly set up for a massive run.  Even if the rally doesn't go big, the current price is a great entry point for the long upwards trend that is happening with or without wsb.  I have an avg in the low 8s and I'm still buying dips."
2021-06-15 22:24:21,wallstreetbets,"Anyone else notice that there are 62,785 open calls @ $9 and 37,155 open calls @ $10 and 55,790 open calls @ $11 expiring on June 18? And a short ratio of 2.13 (or roughly 21mil shares shorted)on a float of around 80mil…I’m relatively new to in depth stock things, but google and simple math tell me between those three strikes there are ~15,723,00 (20% of float) shares either ITM or a cunt hair away.

Observation, not financial advice. I have no stake in UWMC, but I will probably buy some tomorrow because it looks pretty primed."

2021-06-15 23:01:31,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you are comparing Wish against UWMC which has zero relevance in the industry tells me that you are emotionally tied with UWMC and looks like a sour grape. If you are confident about the stock, just ride, but in the mean time, I will be eating your losses as my profit. WISH 🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

EDIT: U won't Make Cash (UWMC)"
2021-06-16 00:24:14,wallstreetbets,"why are you comparing two completely different companies like this? One is a dividend paying value stock, one is an ecommerce growth stock. 

Counter arguments to all your points, for the sake of completeness:

1) yes it's easier to move with a small float - but guess what? It's just as easy to move the stock down as up.

2) RKT also had a buyback announced but they didnt use it. What makes you think UWMC will use it any time soon, especially after the stock price went up quite a bit already recently? Also, because UWMC's has such a low float, buying stock back doesn't make sense, it will just make it easier to manipulate.

2) With all the shenanigans going on, most of the options are covered already. Also, naked call sellers sell OTM options - they don't sell ITM options. That means most of UWMC's option chain is covered, where as if WISH pops there is more of a chance for a gamma squeeze.

4) Lower IV means the volatility is anticipated to be lower - it's like that for a reason, people are pricing in bigger swings for WISH. 

Also, with the recent rise in UWMC stock, RKT is by far more undervalued. Just look at the numbers: UWMC P/S= 2.6, RKT P/S=2.08. Same industry, this comparison is more valid than your UWMC-WISH comparison"
2021-06-16 05:47:43,wallstreetbets,"This is beyond retarded.

Firstly the share float held by institutions in UWMC is 24.08% whilst $WISH is 97.64% which basically makes your share float comparison pointless.

$WISH has $2b in cash, wtf do they need to dilute for?

Point 3/4 hold a little weight but the matter of the fact is it's still pointless to compare the two.

There's no volume or momentum on UWMC yet WISH is coiled to breakout with RVOL increasing and pressed against that 50 day. Looking at the daily on UWMC how on earth is that a good technical set up? There's no compression at all, failed to break out 3 times, decreasing volume. Unless you manage to get reddit to randomly pump this then I see no reason for it to break out.

With that said, I owned some $UWMC but sold when the breakout failed."

2021-06-16 03:51:50,wallstreetbets,"The stock has a p/e  ration of 47. FORTY SEVEN. That means that revenue 47x greater than what they reported in the last quarter is priced in. Their closest competitor RKT, has a p/e of 0.5. Shorts aren’t attacking it every day because if they sold every day and then bought again they would have to pay 50% tax on any gains.

2021-06-16 10:14:19,wallstreetbets,"Your third point is opposite what you think. Wish having OTM options means that the delta on those options is quite low so few shares have been purchased to hedge those options. UWMC has many ITM options with high delta that are already hedged. When OTM options become ATM or ITM due to price action, gamma increases the delta, forcing MMs to buy more shares to hedge. Therefore, UWMC would have more potential for a gamma squeeze than WISH. Not saying it's a better buy, just a comment on your DD. Good shit though overall."

It’s literally the same product.  Just because there’s an American middle man doesn’t make the product higher quality - just more expensive.  Most sellers (vast majority) on Amazon just buy their stuff from Alibaba, store inventory, and spend marketing dollars on branding.  No different than Wish. The American “company” is one person buying stuff on Alibaba and putting their logo on the products.  As far as anonymity - do Amazon sellers (minus the big brands) give out their identities? 

Profitability means little when the company is young and growing - even Amazon was unprofitable for many years early on."

So you apes/retards whatever you are calling yourself now who made lot's of money, what will you do with your money reinvest it? Maybe like 1%. Be honest your going to go to strip clubs and waste most of it. Waste it at your local Ricks wabalabadubdub

* So also they offer [chicken tenders](https://www.ricksnorthaustin.com/menu/)
* Have lot's of locations. 
* [Hot women](https://www.ricksfortworth.com/gallery/)
* Pandemic is slowly ending but you can't travel yet to Thailand, so people will go to their local strip joint.
* Simps can get off of onlyfans and go back simping to their ""girlfriends"" in strip clubs.
* It is a inflation hedge because people are horny 100% of the time. 
* It gives a service needed for some of the most basic things in the Maslow's hierarchy of needs. HH- So hunger and horniness. 
* [Hot women](https://www.rickspittsburgh.com/gallery/)

* It owns [bombshell](http://www.4bombshells.com/) restaurants. Think hooters but currently only 10 sites. So you can tell your wifes boyfriend you are going to grab a snack at bombshells and not feel embarrassed.
Huge potential to take over market share of Hooters and Twin Peaks. + It is military themed people will support the troops right right.

* Positive cashflow, generally profitable. Planning to expand through acquisitions.

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I finally deciphered Howard Marks's autistic comment on ""investing"" I finally understand the quote below from Howard Marks:

""There are old investors, and there are bold investors, but there are no old bold investors.""

It means the following.  A youngin that is interested in making money in the stonk market has two choices.  First, YOLO into FDs.  The second is to ""invest"" in boring-ass index funds until you die of old age.

Under the first option, there are two possibilities.  First, your FD moons -  you then use all the gains on hookers and cocaine.  Second,  your FD does not moon - you end up homeless, giving BJs to crackheads behind Wendy's.  Either way, you are likely to die young. 

After giving this much thought, I say: give me FDs or give me liberty!"
2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH 1 million share dark-pool print actually a buy. $11.32 million dollars First and foremost I am not financial advisor by any means, just your friendly neighborhood Ape 🦍 so please do your own research before entering any trade

Now that it was said! Let’s get to it.

Facts
Today we had an entity posted a dark pool trade at 11:43:51 AM Central  for 1 million shares  at a 11.32 price.

Shares almost significantly dropped  to 10.80 LOD .

This triggered me to think that it was a short seller

Original Post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0j7u2/wish_dark_pool_trade_print_came_in_at_1131/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

My opinion now

After that I started to do some more digging around in different websites , articles , social media etc. and found out it was a “BUY” trade 
Who ever the entity is, they took a massive position at that $11.32 price.

Dark pool trades are tricky to identify right away and could either be buys or sells however here is the time line since last week on dark pool trades made on $WISH. PS all times are central time.

June 1st  04:02:33 pm Darkpool trade made for 1.424M shares Entry $7.78

June 11th  01:51:22 pm Darkpool trade made for 961k shares Entry $9.95

June 14th  10:21:06 am Darkpool trade made for 495k shares Entry $10.20

And finally

June 15th  11:43:51 am Darkpool trade made for 1million  shares Entry $11.32

I believe there is a trend here and I am definitely paying attention, I shall see everyone at the moon!"

Money is going to be racing into these companies before it's too late. Companies such as Asensus Surgical (ASXC), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Meatech (MITC), UR Energy (URG), Agrify (AGFY), Vision Marine (VMAR), CNSL, CMLS, EBIX, PKE, RMTI, FSTR, Genie Energy (GNE), GHM, GIFI, JAKK, LFVN, Aemetis (AMTX), ATNI, Audacy (AUD) and BBGI could likely fly over the next few years."

2021-06-16 11:48:09,wallstreetbets,Not raising rate dump. Raising rate dump. What's the diff? 🤷‍♂️ Americans are dumb!

We were artificially putting off a crash before covid, now after almost two years of fuckery we're gonna have to face the music eventually

I used to think that history repeating itself was bs but I mean...

>During the 1920s, the U.S. stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929 after a period of wild speculation during the [roaring twenties](https://www.history.com/topics/roaring-twenties). By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stocks in great excess of their real value. Among the other [causes of the stock market crash of 1929](https://www.history.com/news/what-caused-the-stock-market-crash-of-1929) were low wages, the proliferation of debt, a struggling agricultural sector and an excess of large bank loans that could not be liquidated."

2021-06-15 20:43:15,wallstreetbets,You definitely misspelled something there.
2021-06-15 22:21:20,wallstreetbets,"Or the basement.  Have you see the Bookmap on AMC?  It's a wall of enormous limit sells and then almost no limit buys underneath that holding it up.  Considering that at least check it's 80% held by retail this is mostly apes looking for the exits but being unrealistically greedy and trying to shitpost it higher.

That huge sell spike at $75 might trigger due to delta hedging but have you really taken a good look at the option chain?  After Friday there's nothing holding it up at all on that front.  If any kind of gamma action happens it's gonna unwind and unwind hard.  That chain is so fucked up right now, August 20 145c has a delta of 0.45.  That's as low as it goes any time soon, no good will come of this.

I wouldn't be surprised to see it under $30 in 2 weeks and then bagholding intensifies.

I don't hold any position on AMC, I'm into even dumber shit than that, stuff which frankly nobody with two brain cells to rub together should ever attempt.  I'm not telling you what to do, but try looking around.  Rocket emojis alone won't keep a share price high, a banana meme is not due diligence regarding current realities."

2021-06-16 09:13:56,wallstreetbets,"Have you seen the reverse repo rates?! It’s all smoke and mirrors and hanging by a thread.  Market crash incoming soon and they will try to place some blame on us, guaranteed."
2021-06-16 06:03:05,wallstreetbets,"When US rates rise, financial institutions have to pass the difference on to consumers if they want to make money. That means less consumer credit for idiots to spend on worthless consumer goods like TVs and Funkos. Any company that gets a significant amount of revenue from US consumer discretionary spending will feel the pain directly, then their lost revenue will ripple upward through the supply chain. 

Higher interest rates in the US also mean more foreign investment from countries with lower interest rates, because investors will make more from their money for the same amount of risk. This results in a strengthening of the dollar relative to currencies of countries that haven't raised interest rates, which results in a few things:

* Exports from the US are more expensive, and exports to the US are cheaper
* Anyone holding debt in dollars is is worse off because their debt is worth more in their own currency (China is one to watch here because they hold tons of foreign debt)
* It forces the hand of other nations because of the above - if one country raises rates then all countries that import from them or hold their debt have to raise rates as well

As for what you should invest in? Fuck knows, the market is totally irrational. 

Honestly, the best thing you can do to protect yourself from increasing rates is to pay down any debt you have and lock your mortgage in place for as long as possible."

2021-06-16 07:09:07,wallstreetbets,"Great write up. The other thing to mention is unemployment since that’s the second mandate of the fed and it ties into interest rates. As you said lower interest rates allows more spending and in turn creates more jobs but also adds to inflation. Raising the rates eases inflation but then if the economy also slows down in response, unemployment might go up. Obviously unemployment is really high right now so the fed has stated they want to keep rates low and have easy monetary polity until substantial progress is made on that front, but the economy is also already starting to feel the inflation that’s come partly as a result of this policy"

Probably gonna have the downvote brigade show up, but once I saw confirmation of the bearish trend on Monday I immediately dumped my calls and maxed out on the put side of the trade. I'm firmly bearish (short term). 39x contracts for $12 exp. 6/25

Once I started seeing bots and shills comment nonsensical PTs of $50 and $100 I committed to the bear side of the play. Everything in moderation.

As said in the ""Intelligent Investor"" the point of the market is to sell to the overly optimistic and buy from the overly pessimistic. BB was never a short term play, but seeing the influx of people trying to claim that BB is a ""squeeze"" play really turned me off of the play short term.

Edit: I made profit off of the original run up. Another indicator that is a HUGE red flag to me is the anemic volume. For reference on the Friday BB ran up it had 450 mil volume. The following Monday it continued and had 150 mil volume. Right now it's struggling to hit 30s (MIL). Volume is dried up and without help bears are gonna beat this shit down."

2021-06-16 16:15:55,wallstreetbets,"> Also admitted inflation wasn’t as transitory as they had said previously.

Can you give me a quote on that? That’s not what I heard during the press briefing. J POW seemed to double down on the transitory narrative. During the Q&A he did add that there’s always a chance inflation begins to be higher than they expect in the long run (which they would then address via their tools), but reiterated that’s not their belief and is not what they’re forecasting.

> Committed to two rate hikes vs zero.

They didn’t commit to anything, they merely are forecasting two rate hikes in 2023, but that in no way guarantees them. Anything could happen to change that forecast between now and then."

Well, not in a straight forward manner of course. Everybody knew they won't talk about it specifically. But they did hint at it and that's enough. Still remains to be seen though how much of this is already priced in. Everybody has been talking about Fed tapering for the last two quarters. So I assume some of it is already baked in

2021-06-16 02:33:50,wallstreetbets,"I won't totally agree with that, but I will say the real problem is education. REAL education. Most high school or even college kids don't have ANY idea how our financial system works, or how they should participate, (I speak from experience) and a bigger problem.....it seems like more people every year don't want to avoid living paycheck to paycheck.

I want to make it clear, there ARE plenty that cannot avoid it. But I've found there are plenty more that just don't care to, and that's incredibly troubling to fiscally responsible folks. Take a look at the estimated percentage of people ""living paycheck to paycheck"" & percent with 3 months savings, vs income brackets. The numbers don't  match at all. Anecdotally, several people I know do not care about their future financially, and if that's representative of an increasingly large swath of the country, I'm not sure how you fix that amid multiple stimulus payments and expanded no-job-seeking unemployment."

2021-06-16 17:11:23,wallstreetbets,"Ah man. You shouldn’t have entered that trade if you couldn’t have sold them. For future reference, there is a way around that. Let’s say you had 415p (that’s what I had). You could have sold the 414p and basically turned your vanilla puts into put spreads. That would have given you (most of) your profit and not been a day trade.

2021-06-16 05:52:11,wallstreetbets,"Actually, something really weird is going on with arvl right now. Pre-market is nearly stagnant with volume below the ground level and price fluctuations close to none. It took like half an hour to actually fill the order at the market price for 100 shares. That's the first for me, that such a small order actually takes so much time to fulfill.

Seems, like everyone is just holding to their shares waiting for something.

On the side note, I'm used to highly volatile high volume stocks, so, perhaps, it's just that low volume stocks always behave like that."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why has WSB not jumped into the Containership lease companies or the Drybulk companies more? I am curious why some of these names have not popped up more on WSB. Numerous names seem like they would fit the bet and multi bagger idea of WSB. I know why some are not mentioned here, market share is too small. However there are numerous ones that meet that requirement and still have potential for multi bagger.

I don't want to name the companies because I am not trying to shill them(I know this ends up a sector shill). But numerous companies have a trailing P/E and forward P/E of less then 6. Some as near 2. Earnings for these sectors have been getting revised up frequently. The Drybulk spot rates are based on Baltic dry bulk index. If you look you will see the rates are at their highest rates in 10 years. Containership lease rates seen on Harpex are at record rates. This points to further revisions higher. There are great articles that have been written recently detailing the DD on these sectors and I suggest if you are interested go find them on SA and give them a read.

&#x200B;

TL:DR  I am curious why WSB has not talked more about the containership lease and dry bulk sector. (Not shipping overall) They are making a lot of money and trending higher. They have risks but low valuations so could provide multi bagger bet which I would think would fit with WSB."
2021-06-15 20:03:11,wallstreetbets,I have seen a lot of names posts get deleted. I believe most of them are getting deleted because those posts are naming companies that have too small of market cap for WSB. Just FYI to those who are wanting to post their comments about various company.
2021-06-15 23:08:34,wallstreetbets,Most of my HS dating was pump and dumps.
2021-06-15 20:22:51,wallstreetbets,"I think you won't hear too much talk about it because it's a niche. A niche that's a bit complex. Not a lot of people have an in depth knowledge or understanding of the shipping industry. I find it confusing. WSB does not like information that makes their brain hurt. It's about presenting simple DD that yields a large reward. Usually you need the ability to make leveraged bets or expect massive stock move. I don't think this group offers a massive reward at these price levels (most names don't even have options). They also lack volatility. Volatility is probably the most important factor in whether or not WSB will jump on it.

Maybe you can start a new subreddit for discussion about container ships? There might be a lot of interest. Also, what's your background? How do you know so much about the industry?"
2021-06-16 02:33:28,wallstreetbets,"No its not, and your account is 8 months old.

&#x200B;

DFV lasted 1 year didnt it? Its about high risk plays, time frame doesnt matter as much."
2021-06-15 20:54:27,wallstreetbets,"My background in this sector is purely based on research. There are some vary knowledgeable people in this sector who have given great info to digest. I didn't want to offer any names I am in the post that are large enough to be posted because I would rather one of those analyst/writers make a post with their info if there was interest here. Not saying they would, but I know one did a post on containerships a few months ago and it did not catch much attention. He can break down how much EBITA the company will have based on deals happening and has done so with great accuracy. 

&#x200B;

On the comment for volatility, there are some names for sure who have great volatility, to me at least. Numerous names in these sectors will have 10% days and 30% weeks. Now no where near as volatile as AMC and GME and others but definitely more then names like APPL, T......

&#x200B;

On your too niche, this is probably a very true statement. Many lump all ships together. And definitely less separate a containership lessor from a liner company or even a container lessor. All 3 are different revenue streams. But I would think you could break down numerous of these companies to their niche. CLNE, CLOV maybe not though. Thank you for the reply"

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Taking Their Blanket And Leaving? Today we saw some interesting movements in the price action of iStar Financial with the stock closing slightly down. We did see mutual funds purchase 90k aftermarket today. (Source: [Nasdaq AfterMarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/star/after-hours-trades)) Let us jump to the Ortex data below as it got interesting with what came in today.

&#x200B;

I took the screengrabs below at different times on Tuesday 06/15/2021. Detailing how many returned shares were being reported. Now, this data should be related to any closed positions on Friday. Now based on the amount of returned shares, I don't think this could have come from the trade volume on Friday. Friday volumes were at 577k shares and the short volume at 47%. (Source: [Shortvolumes.com](https://Shortvolumes.com))

So the question at hand. Did someone cover a large position off-exchange?

It was the right move to make. GME was going to thousands of dollars per share, before everyone was collectively robbed by their brokers.

Also, GME is still going to go to thousands per share. So, no worries all around! See you all on the moon!"
2021-06-16 02:24:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but everything else mentioned on this sub after a certain incident is pump and dump bot / shill crap.

2021-06-15 21:02:27,wallstreetbets,That would be great. I am going into tomorrow with a wait and see approach. I don't think we are going to see $200. I will feel good around $210 - $215.
2021-06-16 02:57:50,wallstreetbets,"If it dips again, 205 or 206for the double bottom is likely the lowest it will go. But I doubt that, I think 210 was the lowest for the foreseeable."

I haven’t sold either because the price is fucking WRONG. Why sell for a pittance of 1000% gains today when the company will be valued at $10k in a few years.

You’re the moron chasing stupid pumps and dumps. I sleep like a baby knowing I’ll be a billionaire in 2 years."

2021-06-16 08:34:09,wallstreetbets,"if he didn't sell why did he post a ""FINAL"" update? he sold enough to move w his family and retire forever. 

there are two scenarios:

1. take your 1000% - 2000% gains, and find another multi bagger. this could turn your 1000% gain into a 10000% gain if you land another 1000pct gain, which you seem to think is paltry.

2. hold your 1000-2000% gains, and wait for the stock price to increase by an order of magnitude before you see the same 10000% return.

do you really not see that 1 is productive capital and 2 is really unlikely? why wait for 10000% on one stock when you already made 2000% on it. just move on, your dollars will go farther elsewhere"
2021-06-16 08:35:27,wallstreetbets,push your 2000% winnings into a fat dividend index and watch it print money for you. why not

2021-06-15 23:49:45,wallstreetbets,"I’m only up 2,535% In AMC since February , so yeah… crying all the way to the bank on your bullshit 80% pump and dump."
2021-06-15 23:57:52,wallstreetbets,"Too bad you missed clov, day trading it last week put me up about 2200% and I’m still going! And that’s in just one week! How long it take you to make that with amc?

Don’t get me wrong I’m up about 1800% on amc day trades too but that’s over a couple months."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Back to talk about TLRY On my last post I was asking for feedback on what everyone thinks TLRY is gonna do… I didn’t get much except people expressing high hopes and one really profound but ridiculous price prediction ($142) by this week.

I’m not asking for a push like GME or AMC but, just like all of us here would love, $142 a share would be amazing. 

I just wanted to hear some ACTUAL feedback and some viable predictions for where Tilray might go. 

Fingers crossed. To the moon 🚀"
2021-06-15 20:39:12,wallstreetbets,"TLRY is the largest weed company in the world.

They have a strong balance sheet compared to their competitors and are arguably the best positioned to take advantage of the US market once it inevitably opens up.

The delay on a huge price jump (aside from a short squeeze which is certainly possible) is legalization in the US.  Once the Senate (Chuck specifically) introduces a bill that is likely to eventually pass (again I believe that is inevitable prior to the 2022 election) TLRY will jump big time.  And rightfully so - the US weed market has enormous potential."

2021-06-16 09:06:12,wallstreetbets,I don't see it on the growth prospects either but the hedge fuckers and the blimp seem pretty intent on pounding down the SPACs/weed stocks right now. Plus I've noticed a lot of the meme stocks (besides $GME and $AMC) have a 30-50% decline after getting pumped up.
2021-06-16 02:06:08,wallstreetbets,Tilray’s has a bunch of catalysts recently. Legalization is the Mother of all catalysts. That will bring us to 100+
2021-06-16 07:50:37,wallstreetbets,ok so if legalization happens Tilray is a 50B company got it
2021-06-16 13:48:26,wallstreetbets,"It will touch peaks of 100 easily.
It touched 300 for Canada’s legalization. 

It hit 70 during talks of legalization in February.

Edit: it will probably sell off yes, it’s a sel the news kind of play."
2021-06-16 13:48:55,wallstreetbets,clueless
2021-06-16 13:53:44,wallstreetbets,"You’re ignorant if you don’t think marijuana can be up there. 

Busch 159B market cap - beer

Altria - 95B market cap - tobacco

Weed is on its way."
2021-06-16 14:03:45,wallstreetbets,"No. You are clueless about stocks. #1 Tilray hit $70 off MERGER news😂and also hit about half the market cap of Tilray current at its peak market price (roughly 4.5B market cap). Second of all Cali does roughly 3B in yearly sales, if all states would replicate Cali that would put the total market size at 150B. The fact is, US legalization is basically priced in with Tilray doing about 200m a Q (lets see earnings coming up) but is already worth 10B. Come on BRUH $300 a share😂😂😂"
2021-06-16 14:05:20,wallstreetbets,"Im not arguing 300. Im arguing 100 a share at least  after federal legalization.

Edit: the merger was only part of the catalyst.

“Tilray struck a deal in February that will give it access to new international markets. A movement aiming to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level appears to be gaining strength in the U.S., too.”

This is why the price soared. On there was a house vote that same week on the more act."
2021-06-16 14:14:54,wallstreetbets,I’d be shocked if Tilray hits $35 by EOY. Legalization will not come till midterms which is nov 2022
2021-06-16 14:35:13,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I mean legalization is an outrageous catalyst. Honestly it might not even happen in the next 5 years. So there are definitely risks there.
2021-06-16 19:29:35,wallstreetbets,If you think legalization could take 5 years to come😂why would you buy when cannabis is one of the highest P/E ratio’d sectors. Tilray can crash another 75% and be considered fair value
2021-06-16 19:30:27,wallstreetbets,"Worst case scenario isn’t that bad. 

We’re still looking good short term for Tilray legalization or not.

I’d rather have a bet in the cannabis sector than not."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Position closed. Average price was $0.02. That’s how you turn $130k into less than $10k. 
2021-06-15 21:12:37,wallstreetbets,Some people on WSB are truly built different honestly to me $2k -$5k dont mean much to me but I still feel bad when I make a bad play.  But jesus christ then you have people dropping $100k+ in option plays.

2021-06-16 05:16:43,wallstreetbets,So this explains why my GE position has tanked since Monday. Thought I bought the dip. I didn't.

2021-06-15 21:57:16,wallstreetbets,I will never understand how some would go full tilt into any options' positions like this in one go and at one start-date point. Why not hold some capital aside to defend your position later in the week(s) if it starts to go against you as you get closer to expiry? Something like turning it into a spread or whatever. Good luck on working your way back.
2021-06-15 22:07:36,wallstreetbets,Fuck GE my dishwasher broke today

2021-06-15 22:45:16,wallstreetbets,And tomorrow the stock will shoot up
2021-06-15 22:46:27,wallstreetbets,Lol @ GE
2021-06-15 22:47:54,wallstreetbets,you are something else
2021-06-15 22:52:37,wallstreetbets,"A degree from a cheap school may not get you far in your chosen field, you just paid for a top notch education, may it get you far in life!"
2021-06-15 22:54:49,wallstreetbets,"Losses like these fuck you up, take some time if it’s one of those ones that actually hurts. Lots of value in stopping to look at what went wrong instead of trying to make it back. For example, my “big losses” keep getting bigger, but so do my wins. You’ll make that 130k look small in a year, and then you’ll lose 260k and the learning process will continue."
2021-06-15 22:55:06,wallstreetbets,Did you have an event in mind or expected something to happen to GE ?
2021-06-15 23:14:10,wallstreetbets,Ge bro cmon😂
2021-06-15 23:16:41,wallstreetbets,"Tomorrow JPow says rates are going up.
Everyone flees to secure, familiar stocks from meme stocks.
GE skyrockets 3,000%"
2021-06-15 23:17:56,wallstreetbets,That's sad. Specially when GE is on path to recovery. It will double from here by end of next year. You guys have balls of steel though for such exposure.
2021-06-15 23:18:16,wallstreetbets,Quality loss porn.

2021-06-15 23:27:43,wallstreetbets,Did you mean to buy GME ?
2021-06-15 23:28:34,wallstreetbets,"So, how did you work up to this? Did you read reddit for a couple days,cash out your 401k, throw it all into a single FD and watch it evaporate, or did this take more work, start with a smaller portfolio, maybe a few long plays, buy and sell some options, work your way up to the $140k and then go for a single ""all or nothing"" YOLO spin at the roulette wheel of FD?"
2021-06-15 23:39:14,wallstreetbets,A disappearing act. Like magic!
2021-06-15 23:45:11,wallstreetbets,"All in that $10k to IAG (IAMGOLD corporation), you will get at least  $150k back by end of year."
2021-06-15 23:46:09,wallstreetbets,I got fucked with GE before. I swore off boomer stocks after that.
2021-06-15 23:50:19,wallstreetbets,why the fuck did you buy $GE in the first place lol

2021-06-16 00:11:22,wallstreetbets,"Oh baby, no. No no, no no. That company has too much utility to short them like that. It’s only money, I guess."
2021-06-16 00:11:44,wallstreetbets,People think options are great cause they see Yolo posts of someone turning $1k into $20k in 3 days but as this illustrates it also works the other way lol.
2021-06-16 00:22:46,wallstreetbets,GE?
2021-06-16 00:24:19,wallstreetbets,"I don’t understand this screenshot.

&#x200B;

Pd: Ok, i see this is not shares, but anyway , when you buy calls, if you dont exercise them, shouldnt you just pay the Prime? I mean the % of ""tax"" the one selling you the calls ask for...or is just that?

Yolo with calls seems like a bad idea. At least a Risky one. With a little % or your money it could really work."

2021-06-16 18:12:51,wallstreetbets,"GE, the was fucking stupid!"
2021-06-16 18:41:15,wallstreetbets,Buy another $10k and cut your average cost in half. 😎
2021-06-16 18:58:27,wallstreetbets,This hurts :(
2021-06-15 23:05:13,wallstreetbets,You are one pathetic loser
2021-06-16 10:48:55,wallstreetbets,"Totally sold 50 of these, sold 100 of the $14s for 6/11 and was sweating it"
2021-06-16 17:12:53,wallstreetbets,Opened position again... 2k $14C... they are now worth $0.02. Bought at $0.04. Best possible liquidation price is $0.01 unless she pumps tomorrow. Got FOMO because I saw her rising and J Powell didn’t fuck anything up. Well. This is fucked beyond fucked. This needs to hit $14.35 to break even. I’m going to let this new position expire worthless. Not big enough to be put in YOLO... wish my luck.
2021-06-15 20:12:32,wallstreetbets,"Oh boy, snack time! Dibs on the green ones."
2021-06-15 20:03:29,wallstreetbets,"If you're going to do something, give it 100% or nothing.

So if you're gonna go broke, lose it all.  Quitters stop when they still have money left."
2021-06-16 13:52:28,wallstreetbets,I've been trying to get to $0 but my last $7 hit huge last week on CLF. Luckily I threw it into UWMC at the top and am back to $3 and change. Looking for a way to zero the account with a small OTM + .65 fee.
2021-06-16 14:31:03,wallstreetbets,"OP, next time that you want to throw money hit me up"
2021-06-16 09:48:49,wallstreetbets,Lies on top of lies on top of lies
2021-06-16 13:00:27,wallstreetbets,Have to close the gate. It’s located under the mall. In the secret Russian  base
2021-06-15 21:27:03,wallstreetbets,You don't do stop losses on options
2021-06-15 20:12:28,wallstreetbets,his what only buy
2021-06-15 23:00:37,wallstreetbets,I giggled
2021-06-16 04:00:58,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-16 08:14:12,wallstreetbets,What's a stop loss?
2021-06-16 13:34:19,wallstreetbets,"This is WSB, no stops"
2021-06-16 14:05:44,wallstreetbets,bold choice!
2021-06-16 14:48:09,wallstreetbets,Stop losses are for paperhands
2021-06-15 21:38:11,wallstreetbets,Let’s get it bois!
2021-06-15 21:41:45,wallstreetbets,Yes 🙌🏽we love discounts
2021-06-16 06:34:29,wallstreetbets,I don't see any flaw in this logic
2021-06-16 06:28:41,wallstreetbets,Who else can saysomething like this. Its an achievement
2021-06-16 06:29:24,wallstreetbets,New level of retardation
2021-06-16 14:54:00,wallstreetbets,This is what happens when options go most ways. These apes really underestimate the cost of adding time-sensitive and volatility-sensitive components to a trade.
2021-06-16 02:33:13,wallstreetbets,Even GMED might’ve been better
2021-06-15 22:05:37,wallstreetbets,Post like these was most of wsb before GME. I wasn't convinced anyone beyond a few people actually made money here lol
2021-06-15 22:09:00,wallstreetbets,Shut your asshole
2021-06-15 21:20:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah but the mods here are just shills
2021-06-16 14:37:43,wallstreetbets,"Lol made me lol, that's some fine emoji art"
2021-06-16 03:49:20,wallstreetbets,"I know right ? I earn decent money but do small plays. Only 2k- 4k here and there. The lottery aspect people are aspiring to just doesn't happen (well handful). Option basics are simple, executing them are complex."
2021-06-15 20:03:28,wallstreetbets,"At $3k/year, that'll be the case for the next 40 years."
2021-06-15 21:54:46,wallstreetbets,Yep. They are actually short and have a large amount of puts on $GE didn’t know that until I dug into short ownership.
2021-06-15 22:06:37,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 6/18/2021
2021-06-16 02:52:14,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 6/18/2022
2021-06-15 22:17:08,wallstreetbets,Bruh autocorrection showed you the wrong one it didn’t made you buy it… thats all on you lmao
2021-06-16 04:17:12,wallstreetbets,You are looking at a screen  and unless you can see your reflection on it you are wrong
2021-06-15 21:35:43,wallstreetbets,Another GME joke. If GE would go up $0.01 for everyone I’d be in the money.
2021-06-15 20:19:47,wallstreetbets,I've worked with that company for years and I wouldn't even bet on a GE toaster oven.
2021-06-15 21:55:32,wallstreetbets,Why? Because I sold? Probably MMs probably covered their calls from me and said fuck it let it ride.
2021-06-15 20:13:26,wallstreetbets,I already own some. I appreciate his sacrifice
2021-06-16 03:52:14,wallstreetbets,"Buy options if you think there is an event you are certain of. But buy what you can afford. On this sub it's a joke, but it's gambling. that guy could have parked 100k and played with 30k, which is more than enough to speculate.

Options are used here way too much when a long position is just as good. Options are not the only investment approach"
2021-06-15 21:06:25,wallstreetbets,"Good news is you are a psycho, bad news is… you still won’t feel a thing."
2021-06-15 21:36:58,wallstreetbets,Well. Beers on you. Lol
2021-06-16 13:32:47,wallstreetbets,😭😭😭 must’ve thought it was gme 💀
2021-06-16 02:45:24,wallstreetbets,"You are on wsb, no need to say ""not financial advice"""
2021-06-15 21:31:09,wallstreetbets,If I had a $1 for every time someone posted that I’d be rich.
2021-06-15 20:16:16,wallstreetbets,Knowing my luck it will
2021-06-15 20:59:13,wallstreetbets,"Cheap options, low vol means more options so if timing is right payout is huge. But expiring out of the money is likely."
2021-06-15 21:03:12,wallstreetbets,I did learn a lot about investments and options but decided to throw it all away for a gamble. Most expensive lesson ever.
2021-06-15 21:15:22,wallstreetbets,Say it louder for the apes in the back.
2021-06-15 21:14:01,wallstreetbets,Yes. It was pretty low. IV on $GE options is always low. It’s $GE but that’s why they are so cheap.
2021-06-15 21:16:21,wallstreetbets,It was retrying a breakout to $15 and up. Thought I caught it on the fib retrace but didn’t think about it filling the gap up at $13.42. It filled this week and is going to reverse but probably won’t hit $14 EOW so I sold like a bitch because I need the money now.
2021-06-15 21:17:32,wallstreetbets,Because I had hope of the reversal and breakout. And who would’ve thought the announcement of better and more efficient engines would bring a 2% drop. Then the $7B of paying off debt tanked it even more. The 100 aircraft order hit it lower. It’s like the good news did nothing and it went so quick.
2021-06-15 21:28:46,wallstreetbets,"$3B going to airplane manufacturer payroll, came out today and gave the stock a nice little bump but all the other news fell on deaf ears. I think I was just a few weeks early."
2021-06-15 21:53:46,wallstreetbets,Me.
2021-06-15 21:58:55,wallstreetbets,That’s how it started... then kept doubling down to lower average until I was too deep.
2021-06-15 22:18:59,wallstreetbets,And another one.
2021-06-15 22:30:20,wallstreetbets,May be broke financial. But at least I am internet famous.
2021-06-15 22:33:20,wallstreetbets,If it does good for the people that bought my calls.
2021-06-15 22:58:26,wallstreetbets,The Safran engine announcement.
2021-06-15 23:31:19,wallstreetbets,Started with $5k turned it into $130k in a month and a half ish then gambled it all.
2021-06-15 23:56:38,wallstreetbets,I do. Every. Damn. Night.
2021-06-16 05:38:43,wallstreetbets,"Guy yolos $130k into highly diluted, low volume stock call options. He needs it to hit $14.23 by market close 6/18 to break even. Anything above that is profit aka in the money (ITM). Anything below that, option price goes to zero at expiry. He didn’t do his own research and trusted Jim Cramer and lost nearly his entire wad."
2021-06-16 02:40:44,wallstreetbets,Yep Cramer fucked me.
2021-06-16 07:59:12,wallstreetbets,It could. I just got a notification the just signed a contract to supply India with turbines. Supposedly a big contract.
2021-06-16 09:13:42,wallstreetbets,">risk management...

young millennials/older zoomers: *what's that?*"
2021-06-16 10:04:48,wallstreetbets,It’s down 1.7% today so no. It won’t.
2021-06-16 10:07:08,wallstreetbets,"Bagholder spotted.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
2021-06-16 10:34:38,wallstreetbets,Because I thought it would go up with good news. But just like today it tanked after it announced it’s providing India with wind turbines.
2021-06-16 10:34:02,wallstreetbets,Yep.
2021-06-16 11:30:25,wallstreetbets,Fuck me.... don’t need updates man.
2021-06-16 11:32:14,wallstreetbets,Should I buy back in?!?! I can get in at $0.04?! I’m doing it. Can only get 2k
2021-06-16 12:16:25,wallstreetbets,LOL!  A true degenerate ape.   You saw that five cent uptick in the stock and started fomoing.  Still Holding half my calls that cost an average of $.23 around a couple weeks back.  Bugatti or bus pass Let's go!
2021-06-16 12:48:30,wallstreetbets,No announcement can make this move up.
2021-06-16 14:10:22,wallstreetbets,Probably my future gambling.
2021-06-16 15:37:37,wallstreetbets,Have you seen it today?
2021-06-16 16:29:38,wallstreetbets,Also 200k calls for $13.5 and $14 were sold short or naked so they get everyone’s money that thought this was a good idea like me.
2021-06-16 10:53:12,wallstreetbets,Well made you some money.
2021-06-15 23:06:02,wallstreetbets,That one is the vegetable one

2021-06-15 20:56:41,wallstreetbets,"No, you need to blow thru margin and straight into debt and the finish line is bankruptcy"
2021-06-16 00:31:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah momma didn’t raise no lil bitch!
2021-06-16 15:28:18,wallstreetbets,Give it 110%. Go in on margin!
2021-06-16 03:14:01,wallstreetbets,Not great not terrible
2021-06-16 10:01:24,wallstreetbets,Just re-watched it last month.
2021-06-15 20:58:54,wallstreetbets,I had to comment because your name is my name too.
2021-06-15 22:27:35,wallstreetbets,What’s an exit strategy?

2021-06-16 00:04:40,wallstreetbets,If you are not red by 200% + from selling AMC calls before the hike I don't want to see shit.
2021-06-16 10:50:59,wallstreetbets,You gotta keep it 💯
2021-06-16 12:08:27,wallstreetbets,Its when your dog runs away so you just get a new one the same day
2021-06-16 07:15:35,wallstreetbets,At least you were an unusual option

2021-06-16 06:31:37,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ man
2021-06-16 12:16:04,wallstreetbets,You dropped $100k+ on a fucking weekly play? You belong here.
2021-06-16 04:48:22,wallstreetbets,"Never realise profits, only sell when 99% loss, that is the one and only way"
2021-06-15 22:00:15,wallstreetbets,Been seeing a lot of posts lately with 1k+% option gains.
2021-06-16 17:34:23,wallstreetbets,How is it different from buying shares? Outside of the fact they have an expiration date. Shares are still subject to volatility no?
2021-06-15 21:29:46,wallstreetbets,AMC EXTREME
2021-06-16 06:40:23,wallstreetbets,or the GMED dude lol
2021-06-15 23:27:55,wallstreetbets,"I check back every so often to see this shit, and god damn love it.   Honestly, the losses are what showed me how yolo's can go bad, but conversely why I have to learn how fucking options work.  thanks retards, i'm losing money like the rest of you now."
2021-06-16 00:11:30,wallstreetbets,I really miss those days.
2021-06-15 22:27:38,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, I think it is the point, to show how unprincipled we are when it comes to ""investing""."

2021-06-15 22:08:16,wallstreetbets,The breakeven is where the price of the underlying needs to be for the option buyer/seller to break even AT EXPIRATION. It’s calculated as the strike price plus the premium paid or minus the premium received.
2021-06-15 20:27:59,wallstreetbets,That's it??  C'mon.  That's pennies.  You can make $10k back quick working your second job at Wendy's.  It should only take two years!
2021-06-15 22:59:03,wallstreetbets,"Wait, what?  You didn't actually have over a hundred grand at some point?"

2021-06-15 20:19:24,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure I'd call that investing. Trading sure. Take a break. Rethink your strategy. Have a good drink and watch a sunrise or two.
2021-06-16 12:48:30,wallstreetbets,I started with 50$ and got to 1100$ with options. Then market took a shit this week and I closed everything to hold cash ahead of JPow this afternoon.. down to 400$ :(

2021-06-16 18:19:34,wallstreetbets,"Your option's value is based on the weighted probability of the stock being over the strike price. Thus, it's a function of the gap between the stock and strike price but also the time left to bridge the gap. And obviously, a high volatily stock is more likely to bridge that gap within a certain time frame than a low volatility stock.

Let's say you buy an option for a stock priced at 50$ and a strike price at 60$ with 1 week to expiry.

If the stock has very low volatility (say 5%) it is very very unlikely it will break over 60$ by next week. Even if it rises by 1$ a day, the contract will probably lose value each day simply because the volatility isn't high enough to realistically bridge that gap.

Thus, an option contract can drop in value even if the underlying stock increases in value, if the time to expiry and volatility are such that it is still too unlikely for the stock price to go over the strike price.

Now you might think ""cool, my meme stock options have super high volatility"" but that actually plays against you on meme stocks because the volatility is priced into the premium you pay. If anything, meme stocks options are way overpriced relative to the stock's real volatility and should probably be avoided for the weeks/months following a community driven pump."

2021-06-16 18:29:14,wallstreetbets,"So generally you want to buy options on stocks that are expected to have high future volatility right? Like when gme was $8 or whatever, options were probably insanely cheap. So it would theoretically be good to buy options on stocks you expect to get a lot of hype but haven't yet?

I'm assuming volatile stocks still have expensive options if you have them dated far out. Like, say for December or something."

2021-06-16 18:43:55,wallstreetbets,"Well yes, but that's kind of like saying ""you should invest in a stock before it goes to the moon"". In most cases, it doesn't go to the moon.

Options are derivatives often better used as a form of risk management. For exemple, you can buy put options along with the underlying stocks to serve as a form of short-term stop-loss on your stock; aka your option can act as an insurance (that costs the premium of the contract) on your stock dropping below the strike price.

Buying options alone without any underlying asset (or worse, doubling down by buying calls AND the stock) is really just gambling. You have to be insanely sure of your move if you do this. The guys on wall street who actually make money this way don't do it on a whim. They have dozens of analysts with Masters and PhDs crunching data and arguing over the strategy before they even put a trade in."

If I'm buying an options contract does that mean that there was someone else out there like me that is selling it? Like, say I wanted a call option on AMC for $100 expiring in a year. For that to happen, does someone else have to have already decided to sell a contract with those conditions and set the price for it?

Or is it more like I can just pick basically any set of variables and the brokerage/MM will set a price for it."

2021-06-16 18:58:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Someone is selling you the contract and making money off of all these yolos. When you exercise a call, you effectively buy the stock at the strike price even if the stock price is much higher. The counterparty who sold you the contract is effectively forced to buy the stock at its market value (say 90$) and to sell it to you at the agreed strike price (say 60$).

That's why the value of a call option at expiry -- if it is in the money -- is worth the difference between the stock and strike price. And your profit is that difference minus the premium you paid to buy the contract."

2021-06-15 23:36:25,wallstreetbets,Their revenue is the lowest it has been in years. They didn’t make a profit this quarter yet are paying a dividend (P/E is negative). They announced a new engine that “reduces carbon emissions and fuel consumption” when the world had basically decided all-electric engines are where it’s at. That’s like announcing a new Blue-Ray player in 2021. I don’t even know if it’s a good time to buy the stock because it will drop when the dividend is paid in July. Maybe if you buy before the potential bump up before it goes ex-dividend...but sell once you go green.

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DRAFTKINGS: The false assumptions behind Hindenburg report This report is strongly biased and based on unproved assumptions:  
\- they consider that SBTech has been bought because of the money. It's not. Tech on betting is complex (regulations, money-related, huge traffic, real-time data, deep-learning/ML models, etc...). Being able to secure of the main actors to have them exclusively for DKNG makes it 10x more valuable than the income generated.  
\- Sportsbooks need volume to be competitive and profitable, specially in the context of US gaming laws. Having a huge community will create a massive network effect and allow them to offer the best odds. Liquidity on markets is the key for professionals (aka whales) bettors.  
\- The number of actors is limited, and most of the bettors have several account/apps. Saying that all bettors will run away to competitors once the promotion expires is unfounded as long as DKNG cannot offer liquidity and good odds. Exclusive partnerships will help reducing marketing expenses.  
\- the argument: the company is too expensive compared to the industry is useless. The companies the selected is totally biased and cannot be compared. i.e why choosing Kambi (1.5B$) instead of Genius Sports (3.5B$) to compare with SBTech, why choosing Fanduel (11B$) instead of Flutter Enter. (32B$), etc...Overall compared to the T.A.M of  projected to be 50B$/year just for the US betting. Based on a 15/20% market cap and adding Canada and others activities (iGaming and Poker, casino etc..) will value the company several times the current valuation. (easily above 60B$ which is around 150$/share)

Thanks Hindenburg for providing us a beautiful discount on this company share.  


Note: I'm long DKNG."

2021-06-16 18:47:31,wallstreetbets,"Did you even read their article, they’re assuming that BTI/CoreTech is a pseudo company for SBTech, based off of “previous employee records”, pictures off the two companies CEOs together, and that the two offices are close to each other. There literally taking all these hypotheticals to assume that DKNG’s SBTech platform had a side company, but have no literal proof to back this up.

Look at what CNBC and Credit Suisse is saying, that Hindenburg has been right before, but they’re most likely exaggerating this time around, which honestly isn’t a surprise considering that Anderson (HRs CEO) has been charged with manipulating data in a pump and dump scheme- just last year.

DraftKing’s doesn’t even use SBTech’s platform anymore, they could literally delete that company connection altogether and they’d lose a whopping 1% of their total revenue. Not that dramatic, yet Hindenburg thinks SBTech’s hypothetical “fraud-ties” are enough to devalue the company HEAVILY.

All in all, the article was made to pay their short position. It holds little to no wait, DKNG is still a strong company."
2021-06-15 23:01:35,wallstreetbets,"What have they been correct on?

And no, this isn't a smartass gotcha trap question. This report was enough to get me to sell (at a loss. Fuck). Even though it was incredibly stupid and wish I just slept until 10.

Anyway, I really like dkng and held it all the way down to $39 recently. I held because I liked it and the drop was after their earnings. I knew they'd rebound so I wasn't too worried.

However, this makes me worried because dkng would tumble if they lost their partnerships with nfl, mlb, etc. And a report that makes it sound like they have done illegal activities may be enough to scare them away.

So I'm wondering how accurate Hindenburg has been because that may go a long way in dkngs partnerships. If they're about to release a major bomb of evidence on the company, it'll be ugly.

Tldr - Genuinely curious about their track record because as a new trader I've never heard of them before today. Thanks"
2021-06-15 23:41:25,wallstreetbets,"They brought to light a DOJ investigation into clover health that wasn't disclosed to investors.  While not necessarily evidence of criminal misconduct, it's something that should have been disclosed and they denied at first.

The lordstown report pretty much was dead on for every point.  The response from lordstown lawyers, that they tried to claim was independent when it's the same lawyers that were involved in the spac deal, didn't actually refute a single point.  Most of the response was non answers.  

Things like production start date, they claimed it's possible that it could happen on time, but delays can happen, that's not a concrete response.  

The claims that they recently changed the entire exterior from plastic to aluminum.  Lordstown lawyers went on and talked about the vehicle frame hasn't changed.  Well the frame of the vehicle was never said to have been changed.  So they are either intentionally misleading, or just can't read.  Don't personally know of any illiterate lawyers.  

The pre order figures, the ones used to show demand for their product and establish value for their company, were made up.  This is confirmed and is one of the big reasons the ceo and CFO have left the company.   Other companies lordstown claimed have pre orders aren't actually committed to buying anything.  A two man operation in Texas can't possibly buy the 14000 vehicles they allegedly pre ordered and appears to be a fraud company as well as they claim to purchase vehicles for municipalities.. yet there is no evidence that they have ever done that ( and it doesn't make any sense.

I think I may just sit this one out and see how it shakes out. 

Nikola fell quite a bit the day before the report (as did dkng) as Hindenburg probably gave the heads up to hedge funds first. It fell a little the day of the report and kind of held steady (all things considering) for another week or so before losing another $10 after hours and then even more days later.

I don't even wanna know their plan for servicing these vehicles if they ever manage to build and sell one.  Guess they plan on them burning to the ground whenever something goes wrong"

Now since the WSB crowed is crying kill the shorts and getting their Cheeto dust warpaint on about it, the price very well may pop back up in the next few days and weeks. Meme stock fury is real and can't be discounted, but it can crash as fast as it rises.  So unless you have your head on a swivel I wouldn't."

Anyway still had some shares and held to 60. Got cocky and saw - ironically again - CLOV trending up. I bought 200@$24 and watched it sink immediately after. Quick $1k lost before 10:30am.

Needless to say I'm gunshy on meme stocks and its probably not a good idea to touch anything hindenburg went after. I know my clov experience was unrelated to hindenburg but still ironic I just lost $2k in two weeks to two stocks hindenburg attacked.

Man I'm bad at stocks. I set up trailing stop losses on my actual decent stocks and need to cash out, regroup, read more, and wait for another major market dip like we saw a month ago."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"FUCK AT&T and other boomer internet provider companies! ASTS is the future of wireless internet 🚀🚀 A couple of years ago, the American Consumer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) included ISPs on its yearly consumer survey for the first time. That year, internet providers came in **dead last out of all the 43 industries** ACSI surveys consumers about—behind airlines, the postal service, and even health insurance providers. Comcast is a literal piece of shit company, same with AT&T. These boomer internet provider companies have been shitting on everyone in the USA. We know Tesla is trying to get starlink up. Well get ready for this company because this train is going to space, **literally.**

**AST Spacemobile** is working on  

# THE FIRST SPACE-BASED CELLULAR BROADBAND NETWORK for mobile phones

You know what that means right? Cellular broadband, **wherever** you are.  For the first time ever, mobile subscribers will be able to automatically roam from land networks to a space network​. In the most remote location, on rural farmland or in the midst of a crisis or natural disaster, people will remain connected at broadband speeds – without having to invest in expensive, specialized hardware. 

# THIS IS VERY BIG NEWS FOR RURAL AREAS!!

People in those areas won't have to rely on internet from the boomer fucks anymore or hope for a fiber optic cable to come thru their town. They can just get their internet from space! 

# The idea sounds good, but what about the team that's developing it?

The CEO of AST spacemobile is an **ABSOLUTE CHAD**. The guy is the inventor of 24 U.S. patents and has more than 25 years of experience in the space industry. 

The company has been doing crazy research too, showing how focused they are on bringing the idea to life. In march, they filed their **1000th PATENT**. The key patent technologies are protected in critical jurisdictions around the world and cover all aspects of AST’s operations, including satellite architecture, satellite energy efficiencies, deployment, and communication protocols providing high throughput, ground coverage, reliability and compensation using space to enable connectivity to regular cellular handsets. It's a testament to the high level of innovation at AST.

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Fuck Hindenburg and their fearing mongering tactics… DraftKing’s subsidiary, SBtech, explained… $DKNG Here’s a breakdown of SBtech, DraftKings subsidiary.

DraftKings acquired SBtech in April of 2020.

SBtech is a Sportsbook content creator and provider. SBtech is a really big odds maker, it’s as simple as that.

SBtech sells their services to over 50 different 3rd party operators globally. Here are a few of their clients:  *The Oregon lottery, ResortsCasino.com, Virgin Bet, Mansion, YouBet, WinMastsrs, BetHard, BetFirst, Cherry, PalaceBet. (*See picture for more clients.)

It doesnt look so scary when you see a list of SBtech's clients. Hindenburg makes it seem like SBtech is selling their services to the devil himself. 

Hindenburg claims some of SBtech’s clients operate illegally in unregulated markets.

Hindenburg is probably right, but who gives a fuck. If DraftKings is investigated, all they have to do is Simply stop providing their odds making services to the clients in question.

Hindenburg is trying to scare everyone by repeatedly using the phrase “black markets”, and talking about how SBtech's clients are connected to the mob. You can’t hold SBtech responsible for what their clients do. That’s like holding Walmart accountable for selling groceries to an abusive parent.

Fuck Hindenburg and their fear mongering tactics, the SEC needs to investigate them. DraftKings sold off so hard the past few trading days. Wouldn’t surprise me if Hindenburg told all their hedge fund buddies to short the stock when it was at $55. Want to talk about collusion?

Hindenburg just put a big short target on their back. Fuck those clowns."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ARVL TA - Strong Uptrend | Nice Breakout | Great Chart Setup First I just want to reference this post which does a great job of explaining the fundamental side - I don't need to repeat all that stuff - [(2) $ARVL - The Second Transaction to “Reset the Clock”? : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0kufi/arvl_the_second_transaction_to_reset_the_clock/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

***I'm just going to review the chart, and the technical setup, since it's nice:***

[$ARVL 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/5odcvxfmih571.png?width=2224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb0dc4385796b9906ae659d283886669f0c7f1c5)

**(1)** ***The Teal Down Channel -***

Broke this one up 2 weeks ago and back tested nicely. We've formed an up channel as well which I'll talk about next. Basically it just  means we are **in the middle of a long term reversal.** The PT for a channel break like this varies - it's a lot different than a continuation pattern. Would look at **22.47** as a conservative estimate - and **30.00** as a far target.

**(2)** ***The Red Up Channel -***

This is the pattern you folks should be more concerned with - since it's much shorter term. Definitely what you want to see following a break of the other one. Basically - it means the **trend is clearly up** so long as **18.03** holds. Below there, this analysis/play is dead. This is important so you don't become an eternal bag holder on a play that never happens.

Rising channels are basically **chop/upside** until they break either way - then you get a much more volatile move. To **break this one up - we need above 21.72 on the day -** which then targets that **30.00** level. There isn't a lot in between - so in the event this happens, I doubt it has a hard time getting there.

Also notice a nice increase in volume today on a green candle - supportive of the uptrend.

**(3)** ***How To Play (Optimally) -***

Two ways to play this one -

First - you could ""front run"" and enter before we break above the channel. This can put you in the way of some chop - but as long as the trend is up **(we are above 18.03) -** in the mid-term you should come out on top. This would also provide you with a much better entry than if you take the second method I am about to explain - however it's **lower probability.** In this scenario - I would look @ **July calls or shares** \- and place a stop loss **@ 17.99.**

Second - you could **wait until we break out** (daily candle close) of the rising channel **(above 21.72, sloping up 0.05 each day, it's 6/15 as I write this).** This would offer the best probability. In this scenario I would also look @ **July calls or shares** \- but my stop loss would go @ **21.49.**

\---

***TL;DR*** \- ARVL is bullish above **18.03** but needs to clear **21.72** for a big move to **30.00**

Can either front run and enter now with a stop loss under **18.03** (lower probability)

Or wait for a daily candle above **21.72** (higher probability) with a stop loss at **21.49**

Also some nice fundamental/market dynamic headwinds listed in the post at the top

\---

Edit: I forgot to mention - this stock has seen a ton of dark pool buying. Over 80% of the darkpool transactions on it have been buys for QUITE a while - sometimes as much as 90% (via Squeezemetrics, don't want to post the chart because I don't want to get in trouble""

Careful guys - way too many people catching onto this move.

2021-06-16 01:24:36,wallstreetbets,Haters gon’ hate.  DFV had his fair share
2021-06-16 07:38:46,wallstreetbets,"READ the whole thing below why I put 120k. (Holding 150k to buy options on the dip)

Why $WISH? Because there is a market for cheap shit (like my wife)- a big phat $2B+ and growing market. There are price sensitive markets around the world that Amazon and other ecommerce players has left behind. 

Customer base and market segment:
- 20% of their customers spend $119/year on Amazon - 90% of their customers shop at Walmart. 
- Wish catered to bottom 25% of American population who made less than $31k. 
- 100M Monthly active users.
- 36M orders daily. 
-“someone who have hard time affording prime membership. Customers who often has their card declined before payday at regular stores. Saving $1-$2 makes a big difference to our customers”- WISH CEO
- Ultra price sensitive. 

Market segment: Tell me an ecommerce equivalent of Walmart? And frankly speaking, Walmart is closely resembling Amazon slowly with their initiative to go heavier on ecommerce. It’s hardly even cheap to shop at Walmart anymore. Who the hell wanna walk around Walmart to find bargain items with half naked kids throwing a tantrum anyways. (ONLY MY TRASH METH HEAH WIFE). I am just an ape but that’s sounds like a WHOLE LOT OF BANANAS opportunity to me.


Equivalent comparison by gross revenue and size: ETSY

- $WISH currently trades at  3rd of the market cap of ETSY.
- has 300M more revenue than Etsy, 
- and 300%ish more monthly active users than ETSY.
- Same goes with EBAY being almost a dinosaur company in ecommerce since dotcom bubble. With $8B revenue vs $WISH $2B in 2020.

With 4th largest e-commerce enterprise, It’s a no brainer. (Disclaimer- ETSY and EBAY are PROFITABLE!) so what! They weren’t before. Snap was bleeding $1B every quarter as a public company until like 2018ish. Most growth companies are not profitable in their early stages. Have you heard about the saying in tech? “Get the customers first, then figure out how you are going to monetize them.” 

$WISH breakdown: It is a dollar general or $99 cent store equivalent, but more technologically sophisticated. Just like Walmart, their customers don’t care about quality, don’t care about 1 day shipping, they only care about PRICE. Their real assets are their 100million+ monthly active customers and 500M overall customers and their 36k small business partners who they treat it as a warehouses and pickup spots for their customers. They literally don’t need giant fulfillment centers to store inventory with an army of employees to get the orders picked, packed and shipped. And what’s more genius is their  small business and merchant partners pay them for services. DA FUCK! This ape is retarded and like simple things. The whole model is just super low cost model aka no bullshit model. They took out all the headache that an a smooth brain ape like me cannot handle. They are in the ecommerce field without being in it. Dumb ape like me knows that ecommerce is a shit business to be in. The margins are worse than my wife’s smelly vagina. If you really think about it, they are not in the business of buying, selling, and even fulfillment. The apps algorithm collects so much data it’s mind blowing. More systematic than amazon in a way because most people go on amazing with an idea of what they want. $WISH relies mindless browsing until they find a cool deal.  They rely on recommending perfect product. And the model keeps learning more about its customers as a result. Think Instagram. 



As a 4TH largest e-commerce by revenue it’s a no brainer. They are leveraging customer data to sell items they care most about without being in it. The margins will be fine once their get out of growth stage. 

On average, their products are delivered in 2 weeks. And if the people are waiting for a product for 2 weeks, it really gives a wealth of data and insight into consumer behavior and purchase behavior ( what’s items they are willing to wait for). Doesn’t make sense to do 1 day delivery for items their customers don’t care if they get it in 2 weeks for a few bucks less. And they have NO plans on completing with amazon or anything close to that. And most establish ecommerce companies’ market positioning and infrastructure wouldn’t allow them to compete in the category because it wouldn’t make economic sense to serve wish’s customer. 

Revenue:
2015: $0.3B
2016: $0.7B
2017:  $1B
2018: $1.2Bw
2019: $1.9B
2020: $2.5B

Their growth even before pandemic was phenomenal. 

MAUs:
2017: 75M
2018: 82M
2019: 90M
2020: 107M

Merchant:
2018: .7M
2019: .9M
2020: .5M

Wish has removed many merchants to bring up the quality of offering.

But what about SQEEZE! I want tendie land.
Well- let’s compare it to AMC.

AMC VS WISH 
shares outstanding: 513M VS 505M
Float: 448M VS 338
Insider hold: .33% LOL VS 4.89%
Institution hold:23% VS 92.86%
APES: rest 
Shares short: 102.3M VS 24M
Short ratio: .67 VS 1.96
Short % of float: 22.85% VS 15.75%

Income statement-
Revenue: 449.2M VS 2.87B
Rev per share: 2.35 VS 11.26
Rev growth: -84% LOL VS 75.5%
EBITDA: -1.36B VS -691M
Net income: -2.98B VS -807M
EPS: -15.59 VS -3.16


Cash flow-
Total cash: 813M VS 1.77B
Cash per share: 1.81 VS 2.87
Debt: 11B LOL VS 48M
Book value per share: -5.13 VS 1.50 
Operating cash flow: -1.26B VS -225M
 

With just a little improvement in margins with minor spike in spending per customer this is a BANANA PRINTER. This is hardly a NOT STONK! This is THE STONK ! This is a MEME VALUE STONK. You have to have a smoother brain than mine to think this isn’t worth atleast $18."

2021-06-16 07:55:34,wallstreetbets,What happens after the squeeze? People eventually sell for better return somewhere else. Valuation is way past the solar system at this point. Who holds the bag? Not many but those who bought it at the top. The apes that invested at $20-40 already made their tendies and got out. At most they just hold a little some now. This includes DFV

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"This is [not] investment advise: Listen to your kids. I’m 30 and I was 8 when the internet started being a common household addition. Amazon launched and was only selling books. 

My dad had recently inherited a small amount of money ($4000) and decided he was going to invest it, but wasn’t sure where. I was busy looking at books I wanted on Amazon when he kicked me off the computer to do research on where to put it. 

I wouldn’t leave him alone and kept asking questions about what he was doing. He explained he wanted to buy shares of a company so that over time as more people bought shares and each share was worth more he’d have more money than he started with. I understood the concept and told him to use it on Amazon. 

He laughed and said, “I’m not going to buy 4000 dollars worth of books!”

I explained I meant to buy the shares. But he scoffed at that. “No one is ever going to buy books off the internet—or anything else. No way to guarantee you get what you pay for, or anything at all. Someone could send you an empty box and there’s nothing you can do about it! And if you put your credit card information on there then the company has it and they can drain your bank account. No one will be stupid enough to do that.” I remember other adults having similar fears. 

My age mates thought everything computer related was super cool, and, like me, were already addicted to figuring out how to do basically anything the internet was offering (like make email addresses and explore search engines). They too would have been thrilled to have the internet deliver them things they’d never find locally (like seasons of Dragonball Z and Pokémon that had only been released in Japan) if only their parents could see the light.

I told my dad that when I grew up everyone would buy things off the computer because it would be fun and easy and no one would have to drive. He scoffed and said “People love driving, and looking at what they’re about to buy. It’s never going to take off. That company will be gone in a year.” 

He put the money into Kodak instead at $60ish a share—he sold in 2003 for around $6 a share. In 1998 Amazon was trading at $5/share. If he’d put it all in and held to today, that $4000 would have grown to $2.6 million. 

He recently confessed to me that he remembered that conversation and that thinking I didn’t know what I was talking about just because I was a kid, is one of his great regrets. 

TL;DR:

Trust the things that your kids, nieces, nephews, grandkids, etc., understand and take for granted as part of the future, even if you don’t understand it. Do some research to find out which companies are actually producing. Then prepare to hold.

EDIT: 

Apparently it’s too hard to believe other adults in 1997/98 were also paranoid about computers, so to get specific: My second grade teacher was like 60 and was full on conspiracy theory level paranoid about them. She wouldn’t even go in to the computer lab. Her 30-something teaching assistant had to take half the class at a time while the rest of us were left behind with her."

2021-06-15 20:08:28,wallstreetbets,"Your suggestion was actually stupid at the time. Blockbuster was a far superior company and it was going to do exactly what Netflix eventually did, but then 2008 happened on top of a massive debt,which was a Black Swan event. 
And Netflix stock collapsed to the the absolute bottom so many times, that the result would have been the same anyway."

2021-06-16 02:06:35,wallstreetbets,"Blockbuster’s business model was never going to beat Netflix with the way technology was going. And those $50 late fees were a real thing and they were ridiculous. Even if 2008 has never happened, people weren’t ever going to say “I’d rather have to leave my house/make extra stops multiple times a week, wait in lines, risk late fees if unexpected shit comes up and have to deal with my kids begging me for over priced candy the entire time I’m there, then sit at home, wait for something to arrive in my mail box, then drop that thing back in my mailbox a few days later.”"

When I talked to her about it and asked why she didn’t ask first like she used to, she glowed with pride and said “the baby was sleeping and I didn’t want to wake him up by asking for help so I just did it myself!”"

2021-06-15 21:32:30,wallstreetbets,"Here is how tomorrow is going to go down:

Pre-Market until 12:30pm is going to be a fucking bloodbath with only corn and corn related stocks green. Energy stocks will be barely staying green bouncing from +0.5 to +1% making them an unappealing safe haven because the whole market looks like it’s going down. From 1pm until Romey Rome gets on the mic the market will trade sideways as people are figuring out how much they can sell their kids for. CNBC from the moment you wake up will be like watching the original Saw while you are having a bad trip in an abandoned cabin in the middle of the woods on a full moon. Terrifying. Burry will send out some absolutely horrific charts and historical data that everyone takes as gospel. 3pm hits and Jpow gives us that nod and cute wink that it’s all good and to close our buttholes bc it’s not time. Remainder of power hour until AH is complete is green as fuck. Spy closes at 428 and ends the week just above 430.

Edit on June 16th at 5:00pm
Results: Not even close but I still like Spy finishing above 430 EOW"

1.) market opens slightly red. Everyone panics and believes this is the second coming of Jesus Christ in 1929 as their beloved companies drop 1%. Everyone pulls their holdings and SPY crashes to 215. Upon seeing this, market leaders and hedge funds short everything. The entire market is shorted 125% and every stock plummets >10% every single day. 

2.) my options double in price for the five minutes I’m taking a shit. When I get back I’m down 98% with $5 to my name."
2021-06-15 22:27:05,wallstreetbets,You know what is hilarious....So Mudrick bought that AMC offering then sold calls against it to hedge. The next day they sold the shares on the pop. The kicker is...they were still short the naked calls and the next day AMC pumped to 70 and they were forced to buy the calls they sold at a loss! LOL if you understand options this is hilarious. They didnt close their short leg. These are the fucking geniuses that we are dealing with.......They basically fucked themselves because they panic sold and left themselves completely open....Masters of the Universe. Lords of the Market. Stop listening to FUD. Its all bullshit.

2021-06-15 20:26:42,wallstreetbets,P&Ds are getting shorter and shorter. It’s hard to jump on and jump off for a profit. Maybe that was “their” plan in the first place. Get us hooked on “easy money” and then take it all away when we grow our appetite for risk.
2021-06-15 22:03:59,wallstreetbets,"I don't expect JPOW to announce anything different tomorrow. But in case he mentions anything about planning to taper, don't just rush in to buy puts or short the market. Some of it or all of it might already be priced in - or maybe not. Nobody can tell for sure. So remain calm and check the action in the 10Y bond yield and EURUSD.

Expectedly, any significant announcement about taper should mean

1) Bullish Dollar
2) Bearish TLT

Meaning: yields should shoot up at significantly pace higher and dollar $DXY should start rallying. If DXY starts rallying, EURUSD would dip.

All of the above is bearish for stocks. All sorts of stocks. This will give a signal of what's to come. So check that first, before making any move. Mentioning this because I plan to do the same.

On the flip side, if there is little to no reaction in yields, DXY or EURUSD, but the stock market moves violently, think of it as noise. Chances are stocks will continue to go higher.

All being said, still don't expect Fed to mention anything different on tapering."

Looking at China demographics like GDP per capita growth and urban population in China is now way larger than rural population and growing which means more customers who use internet commerce services every day. 

All these kids are hungry to consume and BABA with JD will be there to serve them. 

Price to earnings for BABA is at a reasonable P/E 24 and for JD even better P/E 13 

Amazon has P/E of 64 and income of just $26 Billion compared to BABA with $23 Billion income. 

That's right **BABA** is generating same income as Amazon while being valued at less than a third in mkt cap. ($500 billion vs $1.7 Trillion).

One guy came out and reported that someone was trying to pay him to plant fake DD. And yet off go thousands of cucks, chasing garbage like Workhorse or Canoo or Wish or whatever dumb fucking idea a hedge fund thinks they might swallow before pulling the rug out.

Gamestop was the real deal. DFV was legit. Whatever the fuck is going on right now is obvious to anyone who can figure out why fogging a mirror works. It's time to buy some puts when you see wsb getting brigaded with copypasta about a company with no products, shyster CEOs, and explanations about how they're going to go from Powerpoints to mass production lines with an ""agreement"" that for some reason hasn't been agreed to yet.

Central Florida

82F

I'm on prednisone for bronchitis, feeling like orange man when he was on it for COVID. Thinking about moving into deeper Central Florida and setting up my business in a trailer. Pay some crackheads 20/h and take off traveling once everything is established at the bare minimum costs, stay in hotels, see the world, run everything off my phone. 

Everyone should run a business. You never empathize more with the American Dream than when you're thinking about how to man your empire with the poor and marginalized at the lowest possible cost. If the competition eschews morals, everyone must. My best employee is a heroin addict with kids. She's damn ambitious, though. Because ambition comes from being in the fucking dirt. If I wasn't dirt fucking poor to start with I'd be a depressed soy sack of shit jerking off all my free testosterone leveling my paladin and wondering why the world isn't going my way. *Fuck that*. Make the world you want to see. Always be fresh, never frozen. Quality is the recipe. Be deliciously different.  Do what tastes right. Where's the beef? 

Wendy's.

It's better here."

Then i will watch switzerland - italy.  
  
After that some youtube reviews of porsches, ferraries or lambos. Then i will sleep like a baby.  
  
Those are my moves.

2021-06-15 22:56:44,wallstreetbets,"Looking for some views on RBLX, have seen it mentioned from time to time in here so thought i would give it a shot - ive been into the shares pretty much since the IPO, adding along the way and now avg at $78.  Though i didnt buy with the intent to flip it quickly, id very much prefer not to let this slide into the red - at the least, i would decrease my exposure if the thinking is that this news today really is a big deal.  In sum - the negative focus in the key May metrics the company released focuses on daily active user numbers decreasing from april to may by 1% and avg bookings per user down 2-3% Y-Y.  On the p,us side, The bookings and revenue estimates are both up significantly Y-Y (midrange of 25% and 125% respectively).  
For those that follow the space more broadly, id love some thoughts on the scale of this news.  Is it a big deal? Are they basically screwed now for the next few months atleast w/ a stock that tanks in the morning well past today’s AHs damage of approx 7% as i recall?  Basically am deciding if i should trim some risk off my position that i would prefer not be tied up in the red.

Or is this more of a blip and the negative reaction to this will burn off?  I Got pretty burned on Unity by underestimating the level of selloff upon lockup expiration.  This one is a few months away.  Im thinking ahead this time and dont want to be bolding a bag when that day comes rolling around.
Thanks all!"
2021-06-15 22:56:54,wallstreetbets,"This one for you guys!

Here is a high percentage win, sleep well at night move XOM -- I like this stock.  


It's XOM for triple play:   
  
\- XOM @ current price of $62 - $65 is still undervalue for the next 12 months outlook as the world is not even close to pre-pandemic return.  
  
\- Engine no 1 case is heading toward a close.  
  
\- Negative noises are heading out -- it actually created opportunities to buy.  
  
\- XOM IV is still low for Option plays.  
  
\- XOM with massive dividends for 12 months play.  
  
\- Demand for oil is not slowing down as Crude Oil rise each week.  
  
\- Iran deal seems to be priced in, even when it's still up in the air. An overreaction to the deal will create another buying opportunity.  
  
Overall, XOM price actions combine with massive dividends and low IV options -- that's a triple play."

Smart money is shorting this market. But the quants are keeping up the price because all those lambos and rolex are debits not credits which equals leverage and the pandemic pushed them to the brink of bankruptcy 

Dealer/Intermediary, Leveraged Funds, Other Reportables, non reportables are all shorting except for them and retail. 

So retail is actually helping keep the markets from crumbling which answers the question of why memes keep pumping. Its a marketing campaign to lure in retail to keep the engine going

If you look at the open interest in the link of the futures market and history of the quants and how they think they have the markets figured out, it makes sense they wouldn’t learn from history and believe a tweak in their algos corrected the housing crisis

$TTCF (Tattooed Chef Inc) has been added to the Russell 3000 Index- TTCF is expanding its products line- Important acquisitions have been made to boost productionTattooed Chef, is a plant-based food company, that produces and sells a good variety of frozen foods. Some of their most famous products are zucchini spirals, riced cauliflower, acai and smoothie bowls, cauliflower crust pizza, and plant-based burgers.

📷 𝙂𝙚𝙩𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘽𝙞𝙜𝙜𝙚𝙧

The leader in plant-based foods announced an expanded line into a new category to launch multi-serve meals. Five new 20-ounce plant-based multi-serve meals are now available to purchase at $TGT (Target Corp) stores nationwide. Cauliflower Spaghetti with Plant-Based Bolognese, Sweet Potato Gnocchi with Plant-Based Butter & Sage, Cauliflower Gnocchi Quattro Formaggi, etc This is huge, and it shows Tattooed Chef expanding into something else, it shows essentially that Target understands that Tattooed Chef is a game-changing brand, and they want more products. Actually, Target said the Tattooed Chef launch was the most successful frozen food launch in the history of Target.

📷 𝘼𝙘𝙦𝙪𝙞𝙨𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙋𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙣𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥𝙨

📷Tattooed Chef, completed the acquisition of New Mexico Food Distributors, Inc. and Karsten Tortilla Factory, LLC. This is a buyout that only cost them 37$ million, so far, they have nine figures of cash in their balance sheet, which means the acquisition, didn't cost a lot of money for the Chef. The New Mexico facility in Albuquerque, currently produces Mexican foods, including quesadillas, burritos, and other hand-held items as well as sauces. The second facility in Karsten is brand new and will enable the company to have extensive tortilla manufacturing capabilities, as well as to be able to customize the existing footprint. This deal, it's going to increase revenue dramatically for Tattooed Chef and allowed them to basically get a ton more production, as they continue to expand into more and more stores, plus they get to control everything that goes into the product, to make sure it's near-perfect every single time. Tattooed Chef, launches vegetable products in Whole Foods Market nationwide. This is just the start of them getting into Whole Foods, and they might increase their presence there much more over time. Whole Foods is brilliant for branding, because it's seen as a high-end store, and you want to have your branding and your products there. It's very important for Tattooed Chef to have a relationship with Whole Foods because it is owned by $AMZN (Amazon) In this way, if Amazon has ambitions to get more and more into grocery, and in the future, more people are starting to order groceries online, then obviously you want to be in a position where you're in with the biggest online retailer in the world.

📷 𝙁𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙨

Sales are just booming for the company, increased 105% and revenue increased 59% to 52.7$ million compared to 33$ million the previous year in the same quarter. Tattooed Chef is growing rapidly especially within the food industry. Food companies usually when they're doing well, they're growing at like 20% - 30% type growth rates, it's hard to get 59% in the food and drink industry. Regardless of how good or interesting your products are, these numbers are absolutely extraordinary.

Tattooed Chef, by the end of Q2, expects to be in an additional 1.162 stores, with 8.000 new points of distribution, including several large grocery chains. They are getting closer to their annual objective of 10.000 stores, and 65.000 points of distribution. The company has the opportunity in the future to go beyond just the freezer aisle, and get into more and more product categories over time.

𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙘𝙡𝙪𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣 This is a type of stuff you just love to see, if you own an expanding company in the food and drink space. I personally own TTCF stock, and it is roughly 10% of my portfolio. At the moment I built a position that I am comfortable with and I do not intend to add more at the current market prices. If the stock drops in the short term, I might pick up few more shares, but this is a long hold of mine. Futhermore, they just made it to the Russell 3000, this will bring more exposure for the stock, and high probability to attract institutional investors."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD on BBBY: grotesquely over-shorted stonk with great fundamentals compared to competitors I'm not going to talk about BBBY's new management that's turning the company around (just like in GME!), or that 32% of its float has been shorted (that's pretty ridiculous all by itself) - I'll just post some fundamentals for y'all to look at and make your own conclusions:

1. P/E ratio of 18.47 vs industry average P/E of 19.57.

2. P/B ratio of 2.66 vs industry average of 5.83.

3. P/S ratio of 0.35 vs industry average of 0.89.

4. P/CF ratio of 11.79 vs industry average of 23.19.

Quarterly earnings will come out in less than a month, on July 14th. BBBY has been under intense short-seller attack after briefly spiking at $44.51 on 6/02. Just last week, it got driven down by 9% on Wednesday and another 9% on Thursday. All of that was on zero news: just plain and simple short-seller feeding frenzy...

I'm not posting this to hype anything up or to distract anyone from AMC/BB/GME (there's plenty of over-shorted stonks with good fundamentals for all of us) - I'm merely writing down my own research as I learn more about BBBY. With every dip, I either average down or buy more calls. When - not if, but when - this spikes up again, it'll be fucking glorious. :)

The earnings will come out on July 14th. A lot of Wall Street types seem to like BBBY's fundamentals and its transformation, which is why I expect a reversal of the downward trend as we get closer to that date. Will it work its way back up to $35, or $40, or pull a GME and spike way the hell up? I don't know, but I'll be there for it. :) Join me if you'd like.

2021-06-15 21:59:07,wallstreetbets,BBBY is generating cash and using that cash to pay down debt and reduce share count. They went from 250m shares to 100m shares. They have a large enough repurchase authorization to buy another 20m shares at this price. When I was first in GameStop they were at 100m shares then they repurchased 1/3 of the shares in 1 quarter and that set the stage for the squeeze. A similar situation is playing out in BBBY. The key is that these companies are trying to revalue higher and cause a squeeze that’s why they are repurchasing shares. Most of these squeeze plays are going to dilute if they pump too hard. CEO’s pay package is tied to the stock price and the CFO just bought 500k worth of shares at 25.50. I like the stock 🦍🦍🦍💎💎💎🖐🖐🖐

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"VZIO #1 seller of TV’s in America, low float, huge moon potential Copied from earlier post 
$VZIO - Tendies in 4K

  

TLDR;

Extremely low float \~ 18 mil

Solid Fundamentals, great company outlook if anyone even cares anymore. Annual Revenue 2.2 billion

Moderate Short Interest \~7% of float or 975k shares

Options are cheap – IV is only 54%

Low Volume \~400k

No longer just a TV company, Gross profit from Platform grew 152% yoy in Q1

Huge Omega – will not take much price movement for tendies

I was inspired by the [WWE post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvcyxf/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/) in here last week, so I thought fuck it lets use his patented S.M.E.L.L system to sniff out WWE junior. For those of you who missed out on the sweet tendies from WWE last week here’s your chance to redeem yourself. Vizio is no GME or AMC, but as long as I’m getting 1000% gains mainlined to my mommy’s basement I don’t give a fuck. 

# I: Fundamentals

I know 97% of you retards don’t about fundamentals let alone even know how to spell fundamental, but for the 3% that can tie your own shoes here’s some highlights from their Q1 [results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511006163/en/VIZIO-HOLDING-CORP.-Reports-Q1-2021-Financial-Results): 

&#x200B;

* Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million for Q1
* Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million
* Gross profit increased 82% year over year to $86.7 million
* Adjusted EBITDA increased 218% year over year to $40.4 million
* SmartCast Active Accounta grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million
* SmartCast Hours grew 70% year over year to 3.6 billion
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52

And here’s the part that gets me the most excited, Gross Profit from Platform is up 152% year over year. Vizio is already ranked #2 in best selling TV brand and #1 in best selling soundbars, and now they’re going to start competing in the smart TV market. The king of the smart TV Market right now is Roku, controlling a [30% market share as of Q1 2021](https://9to5google.com/2021/05/03/roku-global-streaming-marketshare-drops/#:~:text=Conviva%20reports%20(via%20Protocol)%20that,to%2030%25%20in%20Q1%202021.). The King is hurt right now, reeling from their awkward breakup with [Youtube TV](https://clark.com/streaming-tv/roku-announces-youtube-tv-breakup/). Turns out Youtube TV actually prefers Vizio’s [magnum dong](https://www.engadget.com/vizio-smart-cast-owners-no-longer-need-two-apps-for-you-tube-132131066.html#:~:text=Just%20here%20to%20drop%20a,in%20the%20next%20few%20days.). I’m willing to bet Vizio becomes a major player in the streaming market, plus they have the advantage of already being a huge TV manufacturer. Roku certainly got a head start, but we’ve seen companies blow a 3-1 lead before \*cough\* Skype. We all know streaming is the future, and the future of Vizio’s Smartcast (and by extension our tendies) right now is bright. And I’m not the only one who thinks this, As of 6/11/2021 Vizio has 7 Buy ratings and a consensus price target of $30.29. For the mathematically challenged that’s a *33.6%* upside from where the stock is now. Or put simply to any boomers skulking around, that’s 3.36 years of returns compared to your boomer index S&P fund, and I’m being fucking generous. 

# II. Catalysts

Vizio is getting into the data tracking/advertisement business as well, recently reporting that they have just surpassed [11 million addressable enabled TVs](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005230/en/VIZIO-Surpasses-11-Million-Addressable-Enabled-TVs) in the US. Why does this matter? It's yet another income stream for the TV manufacturing god, and one that has been insanely profitable for other companies. For those of you who live under a rock, almost all of these tech companies are competing for your data to sell to advertisers, and Vizio is finally getting into the game. We're only a few years away from lightspeed briefs ads being beamed into your dreams while you sleep, so for Vizio to start carving out a market share in this space I think is pretty significant. 

# III: Technicals

Here’s why I think VZIO can be a WWE junior.

**Extremely low float:** The float on this is around 18 million shares, which is less than half of the float on WWE. And for you AMC and GME retards, Vizio’s float is only 4% of AMC’s and less than half of GME’s. If you’re still confused let me say it this way. If everyone subscribed to wallstreetbets wanted 2 shares there wouldn’t be enough shares to go around. I’ve been sniffing around and this is the lowest float non-bullshit stocks I’ve been able to find. And by non-bullshit I mean Vizio actually has a respectable market cap and actually makes money. 

**Volume is low:** Volume is extremely low and trending lower. Average volume is only around 400k and has been trending downward ever since the IPO. 

**Options are cheap:** IV on this stock is only 54%. For reference, when CLNE popped the IV was around 80%. If there is any kind of volume spike this IV will go up considerably. It is crazy to me that the IV can be this low when the consensus price target has a 33% upside. 

**Moderate SI:** The SI is only moderate sitting at 7%, but still enough to cause some heartburn. And fuck it, it’s you know what season. With the IV so low if the shorts were forced to cover we could see some serious tendies. 

**Huge Omega:** With the IV so low it won’t take much movement for our options to print. The [Omega](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/omega.asp), or elasticity is huge. For example, when Vizio went up 3.60% last Friday June 18 2021 Calls increased 84%, or an Omega of 23.4. Plus not only is the Omega large, the options chains are fucking *scarce.* July FDs only go up to $30 strike, and if you were paying attention to the Fundamentals section that’s below their target price. 

# IV: Conclusion

This is my pick for a low-risk high reward play.  Its got everything I looked for plus the options are cheap. On the 3.6% move last Friday even my Nov 19 $25 calls went up 12%. It was fun riding the WWE tending train last week, and I think we could have a similar situation here. 

You could even play this stock like a boomer (buy and hold, can’t go tits up) and come out with some solid gains if we hit the consensus price target. I think the July 25C have a great chance of printing. I’m personally holding shares, June 18 22.5 C, July 16 25 C, and Nov 19 25 C, and if this post gains traction here I'll probably add some 25C FDs. 

Not financial advice, buy some shares and options or don’t, I don’t really give a fuck. I just like the stock and the 32"" Vizio my mommy got me for birthday so I thought I'd share this post with you degenerates. I sit in front of a computer for a living so I’m probably actually autistic."

For all the apes who need
United Wholesale has a cost advantage
United Wholesale originated just over $49 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Based on the company's average loan size, this works out to be something like 155,000 loans. Total expenses for the company were $317 million, so the average cost per loan is about $2,040.

To put that in perspective, The Mortgage Bankers Association just released the first-quarter performance statistics for independent (in other words, non-bank) mortgage originators. The average cost to produce a loan was almost four times that amount, pushing $8,000 per loan. While some of that will be due to economies of scale, most of it is attributable to United Wholesale's investment in technology. 

Interest rates have risen this year as investors see the economy recovering. The feast of easy refinancing activity that began with COVID-19 is beginning to wind down. The mortgage origination business is highly cyclical, and we are the part of the cycle where capacity has caught up with demand. If rates continue to rise, refinancing activity will dwindle further, and bankers will begin to lower margins to attract business. 

The price war is beginning
United Wholesale's forward guidance during the first-quarter earnings conference call suggested that it sees a price war going forward. The company projected that gain on sale margins will fall from 2.19% in the first quarter to a range of 0.75% to 1.1%. At the same time, it guided that volume will increase. Most originators are more cautious. 


United Wholesale recently announced a price match guarantee on quotes from a list of 15 major lenders. This would indicate the company is serious about winning a price war. Note that Credit Suisse recently downgraded the stock; however, it did mention the company's cost advantage as a positive.

The next few quarters could be difficult for the industry, but United Wholesale's focus on purchase and its lower relative costs to originate make it a likely survivor. The stock is trading at 15 times this year's expected earnings per share, which is pricey for a mortgage originator. The Street is looking for earnings to grow 37% from 2021 to 2022, while earnings for crosstown rival Rocket are expected to fall 27% over the same period. Analysts clearly see United Wholesale's business model as built to survive the coming price war.

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why you should invest in FCX if you want free money within the next month. I am a retarded ape and therefore unable to write a comprehensive DD but hopefully I can lead you into the direction of people that know they're talking about and you can do your own further research.

FCX is a boomer stock and mines minerals. Specifically copper, gold, molybdenum, silver and other minerals. Apparently oil aswell.

FCX dipped about 6% on open today as copper prices slumped to a 7 week low, however copper prices are already beginning to slowly recover and FCX will recover back to $40 ish from it's current price of $37.35.

Something which may actually make this stock attractive compared to 95% of the stocks posted on this subreddit is that it is profitable and has an EPS of 1.2228. Within the past 4 quarters the companies total revenue and net profit has increased significantly, quarter on quarter.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wuws9cpv4h571.png?width=398&format=png&auto=webp&s=a090e269211337db43c6eaef962bf8465f6249db

FCX have exceeded the analysts' EPS predictions 3 out of the past 4 quarters.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uippqtsd5h571.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebcb466d321cf5fa6f28aff914d7fa2c300ba86e

So the company is exceeding earnings and profitability expectations, and yet somehow the stocks price is still significantly lower than the analysts predictions especially following the recent price dip due to copper prices falling (which are already starting to recover)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/el0w0w8w5h571.png?width=337&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3a0b3ceed948b57d0e60662c42e106bfda974d4

Finally, FCX triggered an ORTEX buy signal with an estimated return of around 30-40% (which seems a bit too optimistic to me, but I feel like 15% is easily achieved) within the next 50 days. ORTEX has previously triggered 14 buy signals for FCX with a 100% success rate. 14 out of 14 of their previous buy signals have had a positive ROI with a mean return of 33.82%.

So, to conclude I am absolutely retarded, however I am very confident in this boomer stock to easily climb back to it's previous price of $40-41 which if you manage to get in at the current price is a free 10%+ profit on your investment over the next 3-4 weeks. This is no get rich quick scheme like the rest of this subreddit but money is money.

I am in for 515 shares @ 36.63"

2021-06-15 21:51:43,wallstreetbets,"There's been some very slight catch up in supply chains but it's far from normal. On the housing side construction has gone from slow to non-existent generally speaking. Lumber futures have crashed 40% but are still double the historical norm. Copper futures have fallen slightly and the charts looked poised for a similar breakdown to lumber.

I have a close friend who works for a metals and materials manufacturer/shipper and they still are facing multi-month backlogs.

Another source tells me the cost of moving shipping containers will remain elevated through 2023.

I work in a major metropolitan area and there's been tons of projects released for bid recently. 

In short, it looks like there's some industries with screaming demand and some pushing back due to sticker shock.

I believe commodity prices will come off their recent highs but demand will keep prices well above their pre-covid levels.

All of this is off the top of my head and anecdotal of course."
2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Pitney Bowes Inc., The Sleeping Giant  

During the last year Pitney Bowes grew its earnings per share (EPS) by 100%

Q1 revenue of $915m, beating expectations, stock was then beaten down after a run up

Every quarter PBI exceeds expectations, with an EPS beat of 61% the first Quarter of 2021

Their e-commerce transformation has only just begun, which is why the share price has increased so much in the last year. This company has tons of room to grow, and they continually innovate in their sectors - E-commerce, shipping, office mailing, and Sending Technology Solutions. They provide Software-as-a-Service solutions to bolster their capabilities for ease of use and scalability.

Leadership

Marc B. Lautenbach - CEO Former IBM executive for 27 years, great track record leading the consulting and systems integration business.

Ana Maria Chadwick - CFO Former GE Financial CEO, where she helped to transform the business to adapt to the future. Just like she has been doing at PBI since January.

90% of companies in the Fortune 500 rely on PBI's SaaS solutions to meet their e-commerce and shipping needs. You read that right. 90%.

The company just started a Dividend in April, which means more investors will hold for longer. More of the float will be locked up. This is good for us traders.

This is a value play. The company is severely undervalued and volume is low. All it needs is to be on the right people's radar to make a big jump.

Gear boxes and other parts that will need to be maintained on other EV Trucks will allow the Endurance to be hands-down the lowest cost vehicle.  In addition, the ability to move quicker than the Big 3 positions us well and early in the market.

https://i.redd.it/d1cu1fh90h571.gif

&#x200B;

✅  Rich Schmidt, Lordstown President confirms, Lordstown is fully funded through May 2022 with millions extra in the bank.  There is additional fundraising happening to ramp up production, because hard tooling requires 50-51 week advanced and paid order before required.   In order to continue to improve production with hard tooling, we will continue to work with ATVM Loan funding and asset-backed funding.

✅ We have confirmed and verified binding orders enough to fill capacity through 2022.  These were all reconfirmed in the last two months and are committed, full orders.

✅ The hub motors have been fully tested on street driving, and we have not been able to break a hub motor.  You will break a wheel before you break a hub motor.  They are built very much for difficult road conditions.

✅ 600 employees are hired on to support operations across Lordstown locations.

✅ Received FMVSS Penetration Requirements exceeded.  Final certification test will be early fourth quarter.  Vehicles will be produced in September and quarantined until final certification is released, at which time the vehicles will be delivered to customers.

✅ There is a Lordstown VAN prototype that is in final stages of completion completed, which will be shown this summer.  The prototype is set up to use same products, build, and platforms as the Endurance.

✅ The cost for the Endurance will be at $55,000.  There is a minimal parts supply cost increase due to covid.  The average vehicle increase has been $4,000 across the industry. 

✅ Vehicles will be available for press and investors to drive at Lordstown Week, onsite June 21 - 25.

✅ Lordstown will continue an open culture; engaging with the team and it's up to the employees and Lordstown family to seek unionization or not... Every team member owns shares in the company, we enjoy providing free meals, and each day we work hand and hand with all Lordstown employees.

People aren't moving away from Ford.  3+ billion in Net Profit in the last 12 months.  Yes some people think the abandoning of sedans was a bad move, apparently those people didn't look at sales for sedans over the last decade steadily declining.

say you have to get some service on the hub motor for whatever reason.

you pull in to the service bay, they put it on a floor jack, take the wheel off and put it up on a workbench or workstation designed for it.  eye level, no straining, no twisting your arm in ways nature didn't intend, no heavy parts to remove or change out.  fix problem, wheel back over to truck, bolts back on.  done. out the door.

The Cyber Truck is not a competitor for the Endurance. Not one single fleet manager is even considering the Cybertruck.

The Endurance has also been on public roads without catching fire. Teslas have publicly caught fire. One guy's Model S burst into flames as he was merging onto the highway in Texas. Ford once produced a vehicle with a propensity to explode, killing 27 people before it got recalled.

Auto companies take loans all the time, as do startups in every industry. Ford took a $24B loan in 2006 and another $6B in 2009. Tesla borrowed $465M in 2010 and $1.4B in 2019.

Inline or V engines easily expect headgaskets to last the life of a vehicle and never need changed. Subaru headgaskets are regularly failing at 70k. Exposure is bad. There is no way around it. The heat cycles and vibrations that hub motors face in the real world will inevitably cause, wiring, bearing, seal, and magnet failures.

There are 9.62MM registered shares shorted. This does not include Failure to Delivers (FTD) — otherwise known as “Naked Shorts.”

From Fintel, we can see that from the May data that there were over 1MM shares that “Failed to Deliver” on any given day.

If we look at the borrow rate for the stock, it is extremely high. In fact, it’s been (at times) the second highest in the market.

This makes sense because there are almost no shares left to short (or borrow), which results in a very high interest rate to borrow shares to short. Today it topped 270% borrow rate.

https://preview.redd.it/co42erslyg571.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e898cb8ddf16cfdcdeeaf95e977858e27462376

When we look at the daily trading data (source: Fintel), we can see something doesn't add up: **a stock with almost no shares to short and a very high borrow rate…. yet, the table below shows an average of 60-70% of the daily volume is being sold short.  EVERY DAY.**

https://preview.redd.it/8abtdw1tyg571.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd2fb4cd6f4a2ebfad55cd0ef25f5f4f0915a786

How on Earth is someone shorting millions of shares per day? Where are they finding these shares when three separate brokers have no shares available to short?

**Section 2: Failure to Deliver and Suspicious Options Activity**

https://preview.redd.it/56r7k0juyg571.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=820e3de51e21ce9d0dd3feab11084929374a1bb8

It looks like they have been shorting this stock for months. Let’s see who is disclosing some (not all) of their short positions:

https://preview.redd.it/dft3upnvyg571.png?width=1424&format=png&auto=webp&s=11a98750efcb5af5c7e9bf9f4258f48c6f2b298a

Questions: How are they still shorting with such a high borrow rate? How many shares are actually naked short and waiting for the unlock of more shares?  Is this from the PIPE which would cause selling pressure? It seems like someone is waiting for these shares to unlock so they can cover.

The answer is in the options flow:

The chart below is for the $10.00 June 18 (in the money) call options. Notice something? 6,000 Contracts purchased every day.

https://preview.redd.it/dp2hro7xyg571.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=020a34d9f0d07f01729cb4428b8f9338173f91d5

And this chart is for the $15.00 June 18 calls:

**Added together (both June strikes)** someone is buying (or shorting) 14,000 contracts PER DAY, and the open interest is reset each day, which means they are being exercised.

For proof of the instant exercising of the calls, here are some calls bought on June 11th, showing 6.81k calls purchased, and the corresponding volume of 681k at the exact same date and time. (You can see the small volume bar at the bottom of the arrow on this minute candle chart)

This can be a complex process that we can go into in another post, but the gist of this is that when the fund shorting the stock needs to make a delivery on a hard to borrow security (like $ARVL), they give the appearance of satisfying the brokers-dealer’s close-out requirement — all the while MAINTAINING their short position) by engaging in these “reset transactions!”

Proof of the nefarious activity can be found by running through the checklist of SEC observations for these strategies and noting all which apply to ARVL (highlighted below)

&#x200B;

The implications of this don’t lead to easy conclusions, but it looks like the shorts are going all out in their attempts to maintain their positions. Likely, there are two or more funds engaging in this strategy, which is outlined in these highlighted sentences below:

![img](d9zb1sv9zg571 ""
"")

We can perform a rough calculation of how much the shorting fund will pay to buy time by using the call option and share price at the time of purchase and exercise.

**Reverse Engineering**

* June 18th $10 call contract @ 9.30$ per contract
* Share price = $19.34
* Quantity 10,000 contracts

Therefore they are paying a $0.04 premium on the stock.

We can reverse engineer the equivalent borrow rate : $0.04 / $19.34 x 100% x 365 = 76% equivalent yearly  interest (or borrow rate)  they are paying on every transaction with the calls contracts.

As per the SEC document noted above, it seems like they are using the strategy called  “The Second Transaction to “Reset the Clock”

Party A ( with large short interest)

Balance -1,000,000 shares short

Party B

Shorts 10,000 options contracts

Party A buys and exercises contracts

Balance 0 shares

Party B

Balance -1,000,000 shares

Party A

Short sells 1,000,000 shares

Balance -1,000,000 shares

Party B

Buys 1,000,000 shares from party A

Balance 0

Both parties have the same amount of shares they started with. Party A benefits from buying time and paying a reduced borrow rate

This explains why there is such high short interest every day. The party with the large short position is refusing to cover their position because they are waiting for the shares to unlock, which would create downward selling pressure.

**Section 4: Conclusion**

☑ Massive borrow rate (2nd largest) indicating a decrease in supply or vigorous short sale activity (or both)

☑ Huge daily short volume over the past month

☑ Failure to delivers (FTDs) caused by low float and massive short selling

☑ Questionable buy-write activity indicating massive stuck short positions

☑ Super tight float allowing for a large pump

☑ Low IV allowing for call-option gamma squeeze further trapping the shorts

TL;DR - short interest on $ARVL is massive, and interested parties seem to be betting on a PIPE unlock soon. They are paying over 100% for their borrow fee and could be forced to cover if the stock gains upward momentum. They appear to be manipulating the price and buying time through options contracts.

How much time they have is the salient question. Feel free to weigh in.

2021-06-16 05:18:42,wallstreetbets,"I’ve held ARVL from its CIIG SPAC days.  I currently have 1440 Common Shares.  

It’s interesting to read this article and I knew it was being shorted, but hey, so many ex-SPACs are, I didn’t take much notice as it’s a long term hold.  The reason why is this..

It has a 10,000 order with UPS, with the option of another 10,000 delivery vehicles,  UPS is actually an investor.  https://www.fleetowner.com/news/article/21121715/ups-takes-stake-in-evmaker-arrival-will-buy-at-least-10000-electric-delivery-vans


It also has a deal agreement with Uber to produce a purpose built electric car for hailing down taxis.  https://news.sky.com/story/uber-signs-deal-with-uks-arrival-to-develop-purpose-built-electric-car-12296202

Arrival is having trials with First Bus in the UK who are the largest bus operators in the uk. https://www.firstbus.co.uk/about-us/news/arrival-and-first-bus-confirm-start-zero-emission-bus-trials.

Arrival has been in talks with Royal Mail for years now.  https://uk.motor1.com/news/265237/royal-mail-electric-vans/

Now, the reason so many companies like Arrival is because of it’s unique proposition and design.

So proposition.  It uses existing empty factory space to set up robot micro-factories, very cheap, very quick to set up and run.  Arrival also has massive European backers, and big plans for European(as well as UK and USA) expansion.  It has a micro factory being built in Madrid for example.

Now, design.  Arrival uses a skateboard design and composite bodywork.  This means, that everything is build inside the chassis and any body work can sit on top.  This gives lots of scope for customisation aka UPS design.

Now composite bodies are extremely light, extremely strong and cheap to make.  This allows Arrival to reduce the cost of its EV to that comparable to diesel vans !!

Cheap, because for example, composite bodies don’t need painting which is a huge cost.  Because they are so light, Arrival can fit smaller batteries, to fit in with the intended delivery range of it’s customers.  Smaller batteries are not only cheaper, they recharge quicker and are lighter weight.

So, yes shorted to hell, but actually a very interesting and potential long term investment opportunity."

Why Party B sells calls in this case? Why wouldn't they short 1,000,000 of stock for Party A to purchase? Is it because shorting delta of 1.0 cheaper than buying equivalent amount of stock?"

I feel like its a unique EV company in the market place. It's a long hold for sure, and pretty risky since it's unproven, but if they can pull off what they've committed to, it will be epic.

Was super excited to see a few decent DDs being posted on WSB yesterday. Dumped all my spare liquidity into calls last week. Jan 2023 expiry."

2021-06-16 00:40:00,wallstreetbets,as soon as the amended s1 filing from today is effective you can exercise your warrants which will negate the entire short interest and drastically increase the size of the float at the same time...just trying to help you guys out
2021-06-15 23:30:46,wallstreetbets,that says the PIPE is locked up for 180 days. The warrants are going to be exercisable on a cashless basis by Thursday unless the SEC takes the docs filed today effective by tomorrow. If the docs go effective tomorrow they may also redeem the warrants on the same day. If that happens short interest is going to drop to almost 0 and the float is going to increase a ton. There isn't a short squeeze to happen here...

2021-06-16 06:26:13,wallstreetbets,Presumably they filed the share registration on Monday and immediately followed it up with an amended filing the next day because they want it to go effective before the cashless exercise provision kicks in. If the cashless exercise provision kicks in then they don't collect any of the cash due from warrant holders and as a capex intensive startup they need that extra cash. My guess is it goes effective after the close today

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLF: This thing goes higher. Today, $CLF CEO LG, with all the vengeance of a father whose daughter was dropped off nonchalantly by her boyfriend an hour after being told to be home by 10, once again raised quarter and full year guidance. He raised it with the assumption that HRC (hot rolled coil) benchmark futures prices will remain above $1175/t. Prices are currently above $1650/t and $1325/t into January of 2022. As Farmer Jim Liebenthal says: this thing is a printing press for cash. They’re generating so much cash they don’t know what to do with it. 

Economic commentators have blamed the brief risk-off attitude toward commodities and industrials on worries about change in fed policy vis a vis inflation. Tomorrow the Fed announces their comments on interest rates and inflation. This is expected to be a formality; the fed has telegraphed its moves for months. It realizes that any surprise change in policy or plan moving forward would rock the markets and put the recovery at risk. The fed most likely won’t change interest rates and will continue down the ‘transitory inflation’ storyline. This confirmation should lead to a ‘all in bet on commodities’ and other inflation trades according to PTJ. He seems rich enough, so probably knows what he’s talking about. 

Supply of steel is still not anywhere close to the current demand, which is not anticipated to ease as lumber did recently. The supply chain for steel is much more complicated. 

An INCREASING short position since last weeks run up in share price is simply icing on top of a 7 layer CAKE of a business operating in the best market conditions possible. Shorts are frogs. LG is a frog-eater, and he like his frogs boiled. 

My personal opinion is this thing rips like yo momma’s inappropriately-tight-for-her-age yoga pants in the coming weeks. I’m heavy into the June, July, and August calls, spanning from $20-$30.

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Car Wars Episode EV - A CANOO Hope - Why $GOEV can be a tremendous play for both long and short term gains. **TL;DR** -  HEAVY SHORT INTEREST, MULTIPLE UPCOMING CATALYSTS, LOW FLOAT, HEALTHY COMPANY WITH NO DEBT AND EXCESS OPERATIONAL CASH, BEAT DOWN BY SHORTS AND PRIMED FOR A COME BACK, RUMORS OF HIGHLY PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIPS

Hello degenerates, 

I like you have been watching the roller coasters and rocket ships that is this market and think I've found something very early with great upside. 

**LET'S START WITH THE BASICS** 

Canoo is an EV startup that will be selling commercial and passenger vehicles that are in production and are slated to be released next year. They have had a lot of unfounded trepidation surrounding their SPAC debut which has lead to shorts bombarding this stock to well below it's fair cost. As far as EVs go it is one of the healthiest EV's on the market currently with $641.9 million in cash and ONLY $6.9 million in long-term debt with a market cap of just $2.3 billion. This is huge in terms of long term potential when $GOEV can easily be a 10 bn mkt cap stock. 

**Let's talk shorts**

The current float available to short is **0.15%**, you apes know what this means, borrow fee is 24.5% meaning the demand is HUGE. A buy and hold can cause a monumental squeeze here and there's only 11 days to cover. I'm going to refer you guys to /u/ny92 post here because he did a great write up:

**Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze?**

High short interest: Yes, ~29.7% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV)

Low float: Yes, total float of 99.9M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9.9% shares outstanding being held by institutions (23.7% of float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV)

Decent volume (also because of the high short interest there's a medium-high short ratio): Yes, Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, [link,](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest) Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M [link,](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV?p=GOEV&.tsrc=fin-srch) marketwatch has the average at 5.59M [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goev)

High short ratio: Yes, based on the volume numbers above – we’re looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn’t be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks [link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&submit=Short+Quote) Nasdaq 11.3 [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)

**Other points of interest**

6/17 will be Investor Relation's day, a potential catalyst as the company is urged to share some good news because of short attacks.

6/25 GOEV/Canoo will be added to the Russell 3000 index along with our other favorite meme stocks like GME. This is a tremendous catalyst for volume. 


**Keep in mind that half of the short interest here is ALREADY under water. They've been short since April and at $9 or under they have been paying a 25% rate. There will be MASSIVE covering.**


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok so, what about the long-term? 

Besides their very healthy balance sheet and being vastly oversold they seem to be getting a lot institutional attention and insider ownership, in my experience this is a **VERY** bullish sign. The top institutional investors in Canoo are Vanguard, Invesco and Blackrock. Institutional holdings are at about 22,661,541 shares but more importantly $GOEV stock had 55 **NEW** institutional investments in for a total of 18,683,793 shares. This is a sign of bullish optimism in the long term. 

**The Covid Killer Car** [Canoo is starting to release positive news and this is the first of many](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-debuts-air-purifying-climate-control-with-uv-technology), their new interior enhances interior air quality, attacks odors and kills viruses instantly, including Covid-19, and will be pre-loaded in the Premium and Adventure packages of its Lifestyle Vehicle. Their vehicles will have both luxury and more affordable models along with a commercial line. Coupled with **INNOVATIVE TECH** the designs are so good that Apple wanted the designer which leads me to my next point.. 

The juicy **speculative rumors**  - **Apple Partnership** - The co-founder and CEO of Canoo Ulrich Kranz has stepped down and been hired to help with the development of the Apple Car. A lot of people initially thought this was bad for Canoo but I see it as a bullish sign. He is still a major shareholder and his design's have been implemented into the vehicles that will be released next year and they were good enough that Apple hired him to design theirs. More importantly there have been rumors of Apple teaming with Canoo to use their self-driving software or parts of their already developed hardware since it's trademarked by Canoo. Limited Apple partnership could be imminent. This can be a HUGE partnership for Canoo and can easily 10x their stock. 


**SEC investigation** - I think I should cover this even though it's entirely baseless. This initially made the stock take a huge hit and has more or less been deemed to be nothing. There is so much positive news boiling up that once people reinvest and realize nothing will come of this I can see a lot of FOMO from previous sellers. 

The Long and short of this stock is bullish, if you were just to buy it and forget about it you would do well, if you were to play an upcoming squeeze you would do well, this is a healthy and innovative company that has been unfairly shorted way below it's fair market value. I will be updating this post with more information but I want to post this on a dip, my position is shares and calls bought @~9.60.  

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**edit 2: I may make a new thread later but I'll keep some news added here as well**

I am still in and like how the stock is moving, [this article here shuts down some of these apple purchase rumors, albeit not the purchasing of certain IPs and product designs, but is extremely bullish on the stock as a growth stock.](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/06/apple-wont-buy-canoo-but-you-should-still-buy-goev-stock/)

I see your first point but you wrong about the second. Greener is the direction people think it is pointing but that is only because current transport does not depend on the electrical grid. The cheapest electricity is generated by fossil fuels.  If electricity is cheaper than gas, it will be only because electricity comes from fossil fuels. The reason for this is due to physics.  Look at the CA and TX blackouts this past year. Look at any economy that tries to decarbonize...when renewables come up short they start burning coal again. And if transport is EV based, renewables are going to come up short.


If the grid starts to depend primarily on nuclear and natural gas maybe that will change. But thats a long way off. Until then, what will happen when to energy prices when transport is dependent on electricity? Will it stay cheaper than gas? We shall see."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RLX Technology inc BULL CASE DD best of my ability RLX Technology inc ticker ( RLX ) is a E-ciggarette ( VAPE) maker based out of CHINA. They service the Chinese market as well as several other Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia ( Even the kids smoke there big market)  Look I know as well as all of you smoking is bad for you blahhh blahh blahh but the truth is if people want to smoke they will do it. It is addicting and addicts need their fix its basically legal drugs.  RLX had a stock price less then 6 months ago ranging as high as $26.76. 

THIS COMPANY MAKES MONEY last earnings they posted a .29 cents a share BEAT POSITIVE. ( Expected was .26 cents earnings)  

&#x200B;

Why did it go down ? 

Back around March 19th ( check the chart for the big drop) CHINA announced that they want to regulate e-cigarettes' in the same way they regulate regular tobacco products.  ( CHINA makes big tax money on standard cigarettes' and just like all CHINA company's the CCP takes a big piece of the action) . They also stated the health concerns etc.. 

Once this happened the shorts of course jumped on board and the slimy lawfirms all announced their lawsuits.  

The stock has traded in a $9-$10 range ever since. 

Here is my bull case. 

This company is still in its infancy they are picking up more and more distributors offline throughout the world.  YOY growth is up and moving at a good rate. 

for a relatively new company they are already profitable ( a rarity)  

smoking is addicting and its not going anywhere. Many customers that pick up this bad habit make it a lifelong addiction that cost them up to $188 a month on average and up to $23k over a 10 year period.  this company has a their foot in the door of the largest smoking market in the world. 

Many smokers now prefer Vape because they feel its easier to smoke and some believe healthier. 

&#x200B;

Anyway i think smoking is a bad habit but I cant ignore the fact that people will do it anyway. Bought 500 shares today prob will buy another 500 tomorrow during the fed speech. 

best of luck"

* 100/100 Squeeze Score from S3 (Ihor)
* $700,000,000 in cash, no debt
* No threat of stock dilutions or market offerings
* Insider's can't sell stock unless stock is >$30 for 90 days
* Citadel owns 5x more AMC stock than CLOV, they take positions in stocks they short as a hedge or secret final weapon.
* Machine Learning AI Assistant for doctors and works with Medicare (growth market)
* Victim of hit piece from shorting hedge fund FUD Hindenburg (same people who slandered DKNG falsely in laughable reports), DOJ investigation from months ago  hasn't gone anywhere
* Let's be real, high org ownership is actually kind of good for this squeeze, they're far more diamond handed than day traders or brand new apes.
* Last run up was from $10 to almost $30 - only 5% of shorts covered! For a 3x return we only had 5% cover. Imagine if we forced them all to cover. They've only seen a FRACTION of our POWER.

CLOV was advertised on main stream media for couple days out of no where.. why do you think that is? GME and AMC has real reasons... you guys can try to hype it all you want but CLOV is owned by the same hedge funds we're fighting against.

""But scaling in direct contracting is proving more difficult than expected, as Clover lowered membership expectations from 200,000 people in 2021 to between 70,000 to 100,000 by the end of the year.""

DC had been forecast as the overwhelming driver of growth.  See page 47 here: https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/8947bb5e-eb8d-4aa5-9c11-186c518d7676.

Anything else?  No?  Ok, then shut the fuck up."
2021-06-15 22:06:09,wallstreetbets,That would hurt a bit.
2021-06-15 23:08:13,wallstreetbets,"Stay with me here and read this very carefully (taken directly from the 10-K):

*""The Sponsor has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Class B ordinary shares or Class A ordinary shares received upon conversion thereof  (together, “Founder Shares”) until the earlier of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination and (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, amalgamation, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company’s shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.""*

They've met this threshold, which means that ""management"" can unload approximately 213,000,000 shares on July 5th.  How do you back into this number?  Well, go total up Class B shares defined under CHI Holders, Holders, Director Holders and Investor Stockholders.  The list is about 26 individual and entities, consisting of C-level employees, board members, various LLCs, etc.  Vivek Garipalli himself owns 86.3 million shares that would fall under this agreement, along with 96.3 million owned by Greenoaks and Chamath.  And of course Chelsea Clinton with 685,000.

This myth that somehow those that run the company aren't going to get fucking paid if they don't meet this absurd standard is complete bullshit.  They can unload literally hundreds of millions of shares on the 5th.

Two more interesting things you'll want to consider:  Greenoaks doesn't have a seat on the board.  Why?  So any blackout periods won't apply to them.  Second - Chamath's 10 million shares are being used as loan collateral at Credit Suisse.  I'm gonna go ahead and venture a guess with the crack team of risk managers at CS still reeling from Archegos, they're probably not going to sit on that shit for long.

This is why SPACs are used - they can create opaque capital structures that in no way benefit the average shareholder.  But I know, I'm just spreading FUD and don't know anything about CLOV, right?"
2021-06-15 22:26:05,wallstreetbets,"Also, you seem to think AMC with a couple thousand can make you a millionaire. Right.  I think it has potential, but you can't be more delusional than that lol"

2021-06-15 22:20:34,wallstreetbets,"Short interest went up 8% today according to Orbex, utilization maxed out, volume was way down at about 1/3 of the average, and the stock price (only) went down by 6%. Very bullish data. With tons of calls expiring on Friday and 50% float, it’s clear that the shorts are just trying to get as many calls out of the money as possible by then. And given the amount of money they’re borrowing to do it, wouldn’t exactly say their attempts are terribly impressive. Their short target is $6 a share. It’s not getting anywhere near that in the next couple of days, considering that with full artillery they barely got it under 14 today."

The stock has been downgraded and it has shit for earnings and most of wsb has lost interest so no more options pumping the stock. Its over, just leave it and pump something else more worthwhile."

2021-06-16 13:42:32,wallstreetbets,"everything else is to take away from the fire power of GME. What got WSB on the news? GME. What started the influx of new accounts? GME. What stock was originally found as over 140% shorted (potentially billions of fake shares being shorted multiple times)? GME. What is the only stock NOT being talked about here any more because it would cause a financial meltdown in the US transferring more money away from Wall St than ever was in history? G M E. I like the stock, hold for the moon."

2021-06-15 20:06:09,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they had enough volume and time to cover their positions. However, they lose if they cover and these guys are not used to losing. If I was a hedge fund owner, with billions of dollars and my ego at stake, I would use every single loophole to make the GME flame go out. Which is actually why it is possible shorts have not covered."
2021-06-15 20:49:24,wallstreetbets,First time?
2021-06-16 13:44:37,wallstreetbets,what is even more disgusting is the fact the mods made a thread for these hedge fund pump and dumps. If that doesn't scream this sub is compromised than you will never learn. GME is the only play.
2021-06-15 23:35:20,wallstreetbets,"Yes, a few % drop is generally considered a tank."
2021-06-16 03:19:57,wallstreetbets,Can it unwind when call purchases are still around 10000 ITM at the moment. That makes a price job the more confusing. I would have expected more hovering
2021-06-15 20:44:11,wallstreetbets,I hope not for all our sakes
2021-06-16 06:37:25,wallstreetbets,I am but its been stagnant for a while just wondering if i missed anything

2021-06-15 20:08:52,wallstreetbets,I thought the new data came out a while ago about 20% short of float? I haven’t been following for a while
2021-06-15 20:03:02,wallstreetbets,How do you know they didnt? You dont think the massive spikes lately was them covering? Theres not enuf shares for retail to drive it that high
2021-06-15 20:23:29,wallstreetbets,Lambo or food stamps
2021-06-16 01:23:51,wallstreetbets,"Seconded, it’s really awful."
2021-06-16 04:22:50,wallstreetbets,">can it unwind when millions of shares have suddenly become ITM and will need to be sold to cash in profits?

yes."
2021-06-15 23:41:57,wallstreetbets,Its like another small paycheck. Literally if you fuck with stocks and you don't sell CC's you're leaving so much money on the table. It's rediclus.
2021-06-15 21:20:28,wallstreetbets,"Ohh nice, that should be a fun week"
2021-06-16 11:37:02,wallstreetbets,"25'th. 

Waiting for the confirmation that GME will enter Russell 1000. Not sure when it will be announced, but it will be either the 18'th or the 25'th."
2021-06-15 20:39:03,wallstreetbets,Chill bruh i was just typing a random thought. I specified that it wasnt the case lol
2021-06-15 20:11:39,wallstreetbets,Hiding shorts with otm puts. Which is being proven by each ftd cycle. Pages of dd out there about it.
2021-06-15 20:52:52,wallstreetbets,Because it confirmed their bias. The only other option is admitting they're wrong and they aren't going to do that.
2021-06-16 12:37:23,wallstreetbets,Im 1 too. I just joined because I have a banana fetish.
2021-06-15 23:17:14,wallstreetbets,Also probably if they try to randomly chat you up and suddenly their account disappears is how you can tell it's a bot.
2021-06-16 04:25:24,wallstreetbets,You know that MM have to hedge their call sales right? Unless an option is executed the shares should be tied up
2021-06-15 23:43:11,wallstreetbets,"easily, have you been selling any gme cc’s?"
2021-06-15 20:36:41,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-15 21:10:53,wallstreetbets,"I didn't mean any offense. I was just trying to present my logic concisely. I was replying before you added the line ""Obviously if you took it seriously then your a dingdong""."
2021-06-15 20:18:31,wallstreetbets,"I haven't followed since february, but with my old knowledge I do remember the DD back then talking about how hedge funds could not hold for prolonged periods of time due to how expensive the short borrow rate had gotten, leading to that slogan ""I can stay retarded longer than you can stay solvent"". Thus leading to an inevitable gamma squeeze. 

That plus also a lot of the DD mentioning a certain date when large amounts of calls were going to end up in the money, forcing hedge funds to cough up real shares instead of synthetic ones. 

But it's been nearly half a year since then and A. that's a very significant amount of time to be paying short borrow rates B. there have been way too many weeks worth of calls expiring to force that real share vs synthetic share thing to unravel right? So the situation behind the original thesis has to have changed. 

Obviously I know that upvotes and downvotes now are based solely on each redditor (or bot)'s personal holdings but maybe someone impartial can spell out what exactly is happening now."
2021-06-16 01:05:46,wallstreetbets,"Well there’s plenty of evidence that points to a strong POSSIBILITY that they haven’t, and that they’ve maybe even dug themselves into a hole that they can’t painlessly get out of."
2021-06-15 21:31:25,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-16 05:04:08,wallstreetbets,"you know that mm hedge their call sales by continually purchasing individual shares as the call option moves closer to ATM right?

you know the people who have these options need to sell / exercise then sell in order to realize gains, right?"
2021-06-15 23:47:42,wallstreetbets,No I don't mess with GME I got burned on it recently and it pissed me off. But AMC is smaller capped and has some insane IV so I've been making bank weekly on those.... like 2x more than GME.
2021-06-15 21:15:27,wallstreetbets,"It’s OK bro I apologize if I came off rash as well I share the same thought process as you it was a shit thought XD

I vouch for you. You def got in before the dingdongs"
2021-06-15 20:20:55,wallstreetbets,"So now another things comes it - People are pumping amc and some hedge funds have a big long positions in them.
Also there was a fuckton of crypto pumps that perhaps made them stay solvent longer.

And we will see what 005 does. I personally have high hopes - but no dates."
2021-06-15 21:56:59,wallstreetbets,"I'll take a stab at answering for you. The borrow rates are crazy stupid low. Like 1% with almost 0 shares available to short. 1.1m did pop up today out of nowhere but I haven't seen that in a long while. So it doesn't cost much to short for long periods of time..mind you a lot of these have been open for over a year or two. 1% is nothing. There are still tons and tons of synthetic shares out I think. This would be evidenced by the ftd cycle that we've been seeing for the past few months. The latest run out of 160 to 300 was because of the ftd cycles. They both happened in the same timeframe and led to what we saw. There's a ton out there for you to look at.

Tldr, shorts didn't cover despite what the say and There's a bazillion shares floating around"
2021-06-15 20:23:53,wallstreetbets,"Also just cuz shit keeps popping into my head - banks sold record numbers of junk bonds.

Today European Union banned a fuckton of big banks from selling more of their bonds.

It’s like their money supply is getting lower. Being solvent might become more and more difficult. Hopefully.

I’ve been holding since December and I’m not going anywhere until the job is finished."

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"11 reasons to invest in $WISH If you agree with any one of the points below this is an excellent entry point.

1. Worldwide demographic change to value conscience shopping via widening of wealth gap. (Sad but true)
2. Wish local provides access to areas that have never before been able to online shop. Its also given a large competitive advantage to other areas in terms of shipping rates and product availability.
3. Wish de-emphasizing cheap products and adding new lines including furniture to bring revenue per consumer up.
4. Bringing in J.Reses as executive who’s experience in this industry is invaluable.
5. Anniversary out all the lost customers who had a bad experience in Q1-2 of last year due to bad shipping times and limited product availability. This was mainly due to the early lockdown in China and banned Chinese commercial flights internationally. 
6. Wish logistics revenue rising steady. This might actually be the largest revenue stream in the future as other companies hire wish for 3rd party logistics and take advantage of wish local centers.
7. The world is shifting to online shopping. Online stores will always win in regards to price and convenience as they have such a low CAPEX costs. The overhead on running a brick and mortar store is reflected in their prices. Everything is changing to online, from groceries to furniture.
8. Quality and delivery times are improving. Last quarter WISH had an all time low refund rate. They’re actively delisting low quality items and misleading products. They’re also on a hiring spree to further improve this segment.
9. Partnership announced yesterday with PrestaShop will get wish products listed on 300,000 new internet stores. This should add billions in revenue to $Wish’s bottom line.
10. If the stock market has a correction and/or potential inflation hikes eroded consumer purchasing power we’ll see a large swing into budget buying. Many people will adjust spending habits from higher priced platforms like Amazon and focus solely on price point. This will make $WISH a great company to hold during recessive times. 
11. What other stock can you buy that sells dildos. 

FYI - this post was originally deleted because of my low karma. Attempting repost.

Disclaimer: I'm all in. I was extremely happy to buy this stock near IPO price and currently holding a bag at average cost of $20/share. I’m not concerned as I truly believe this stock will be worth three digits in a few years."

2021-06-16 07:18:51,wallstreetbets,"DON’T invest in wish. 

I’m so tired of Wall Street firms having their young brokers try and post and take over this forum. Don’t you all find it odd how every day there’s so many posts of the same thing that was never discussed on here before yet all of a sudden numerous posts tellin us to invest in come company out of nowhere while telling us to sell AMC and GME?!

This is Wall Street firms making their young brokers come on here try to use our wording and post crap to benefit their firm. 

Fk WISH and whatever company posts on here tell us to invest in that we’ve never discussed before. 

Just buy and hold AMC GME !!!!"

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"20% of CRSR's total float is tied to open Call options between $35 - $40C. The big boys DO NOT want it going over $40. I've been posting DD about CRSR for months now. Most of it has described how undervalued this stock is right now compared to its own fundamentals and the industry as a whole.

Given the recent influx of new CRSR investors, here's the lowdown.

Market forces have been holding it in a sideways trading pattern for a long time now.

Since other DD has covered the underlying fundamentals to death at this point, I want to point out the big reason why this stock continues to trade sideways - despite very bullish fundamentals, and while comparative industry competitors steadily gain.

The float of CRSR is **LOW.** Even with some of the recent insider trades, the float trading stands at just 31.4 Million Shares.  Because of this, it has been very easy for the price to swing dramatically in intraday trading. If you look at any intraday chart for CRSR, you'll see that its not uncommon for it to swing +/- 3-4% every day...sometimes multiple times in a day.

Meanwhile, Eagletree Capital (the P/E firm who holds a majority stake in the company) has been dumping shares to lock in profits from the post IPO runup.

The long term trading patterns have kept it bouncing infinitely between about $31 and $35.

If you look at the options chains, the real reason is revealed. What you'll see is a HUGE % of the total floated shares are tied to Calls/Puts. The total Open Interest on calls is 12.9 Million...41% of the total float!

What you'll also see is that \~20% of the total float is tied to open call options between $35-$40 through EOY.

There is also a huge % of the open Puts at $30. 

Big pocket investors have been playing this one like a puppet. They take advantage of the low float to drive the price up, write a bunch of calls during periods of high upwards momentum, collect a ton premium, sell/short to drive the price down, cover....drive the price up again.  Rinse repeat.As long as they're keeping it <$35 at expiry, they're raking in cash from the premiums/IV. They absolutely do not want to let this thing break $40....they will lose tens of millions of dollars

https://preview.redd.it/5pvirt5chg571.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=431f943a203646293d12b9ad86efe2bf54dc67e4

As a comparison, here is LOGI's chain. A similar industry competitor...with 5x the float, and a fraction of the options open interest.

https://preview.redd.it/q3l58zycig571.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=39d53ab8148d244d9f9a9a3177a1ea6c1f84b62b

The % of this stock held by institutions is very high. Retail investors need to continue to accumulate shares and hold them to break the sideways puppet cycle. Also buying calls with longer expiry rather than short term.

In any case, this stock is not a meme. It is a very rock solid company, with great fundamentals, currently being strangleheld under where it should be trading.

In fact, Eagle Tree dumping shares is a net positive so long as the volume stays high…the higher float will chase the swing traders away 

Otherwise, they will continue to play this like a puppet.

Positions: 150 Shares @ $30-$39  ;  42 calls at $35-$60C expiring 6/18, 8/20, 12,17, and 1/21"

2021-06-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DKNG DRAFT KINGS ARE FOR THE APES 🎩🦍 I'm long the stock lesgoooo DraftKings Inc. fell the most since March on Tuesday after short seller Hindenburg Research said it was betting against the online gambling company.
Boston-based DraftKings -- which went public via a reverse merger in April 2020 -- plunged as much as 12% Tuesday to $44.65 after the report, its biggest drop since March 5. The stock trimmed losses to 4.5%, trading at $48.39 at 11 a.m. in New York.
...
Hindenburg disclosed a short position against the stock, meaning it will benefit from any drops in the shares. The short seller has recently waged other critiques against Lordstown Motors Corp. and Nikola Corp., which contributed to heavy losses on the stocks.

“This report is written by someone who is short on DraftKings stock with an incentive to drive down the share price,” the company said in a statement.

DraftKings shares have slipped from a March record
The Hindenburg report on DraftKings focused on the company’s technology platform subsidiary SBTech, as well as profits made by insiders who have cashed in on the stock’s surge from its deal announcement. DraftKings had soared nearly 400% from December 2019 when the company announced its three-way deal to go public alongside SBTech through Monday’s close.

DraftKings said it conducted a thorough review of SBTech’s business practices and that it was “comfortable with the findings” before the deal was completed in 2020.

Credit Suisse analyst Benjamin Chaiken defended DraftKings in a note, saying investors should use the stock’s drop as an opportunity ahead of potential gambling legalization in Canada and in New York. The analyst rates the stock ‘outperform’, with a price target at $85.

Broad Declines
Weakness for sports betting companies went beyond DraftKings as the Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming exchange-traded fund (BETZ), a sports betting and iGaming ETF, dipped as much as 2.5%. Flutter Entertainment Plc., which owns DraftKings’ rival FanDuel, fell as much as 5.5% in London.


DraftKings shares have stumbled over recent months amid a dearth of top sporting events and a broader slide for high-flying companies. The company is one of a slew of startups that have gone public through mergers with special purpose acquisition companies.

The gaming company has yet to turn a profit and is not expected to post positive earnings until 2026, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

However, Wall Street analysts are broadly positive on the company with 20 rating shares a buy and eight having hold-equivalents. None rate it a sell and the average 12-month price target of $70 implies shares will rise 49% over the coming year.

Short Risks
Short sellers are increasingly facing pushback on trading platforms and social media, where retail traders publicly challenge investors who stand to profit from a company’s woes.

Trading in so-called meme stocks has remained hot since the start of the year after Reddit users rallied behind video game retailer GameStop Corp. after investors including Citron Capital’s Andrew Left and Gabriel Plotkin’s Melvin Capital announced bets against the company.

Left said the money manager covered most of its short bets against GameStop at a loss of 100% in late January and later said his firm would discontinue offering short-sell analysis.

Roughly one-tenth of DraftKings shares available for trading are currently sold short, according to data compiled by S3 Partners. That compares to a February low of 5.2%.

Many are probably shit, but I think these 7 might warrant more discussion. Rather than push the same ticker everyday for months, why don't we try to figure out what the next big ones could be?

Below I'll list off 7 tickers with a brief description of why I've chosen to include them here. For the record, I am invested in a few of these, but not all of them. I'm not pushing any in particular here, I just want to see which ones you all are bullish/bearish on. Some have been mentioned more than others.

$BGS - Someone posted some excellent DD [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzszyd/bgs_green_giant_dildos_and_cream_of_wsb/) I recommend checking it for more details. But suffice it to say, it's got good earnings, it's heavily shorted, and judging by its market cap/enterprise value, it's notably undervalued at the moment. The memeability of the company is a hilarious bonus, as explained in the DD post.

$WEN - Nice earnings, undervalued, has a new summer salad, and has already gotten a little meme attention. If nothing else, the recent boost it had and algorithmic confusion with all the ""sir this is a wendy's"" posts are cause to think it could pump again. Some DD [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nudcrm/to_the_guy_who_recommended_wendys_stockwen_proper/)

$ASO - A very healthy stock outperforming earnings estimates and showing steady growth since its IPO last fall. It's also being heavily shorted. Plus sports and outdoors equipment should only keep going up through the summer and as school sports return in the fall. DD [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxtv1j/aso_ape_here_some_fast_fact_dd_for_you_all/)

$SKT - Someone mentioned it to me earlier today. In addition to being heavily shorted, this one has low enough float/volume that it's showing 11 Days-to-Cover. Looking at the SMAs, I'm also seeing a pattern that occurred just before the last runup begin to form again. Finally, with everything reopening, it seems to me that malls will begin to generate more revenue again.

$BMBL - Ran up 7.5% yesterday. They showed decent (albeit not stellar) earnings last quarter, and they do have enough market share that I believe they can grow consistently now that their price has tumbled down to a more fair valuation. Plus, ya know, online dating, LOL.

$WOOF - I suddenly saw a ton of people mentioning this one yesterday, but most had no idea why they were talking about it. To be honest I hate the stock, but the sheer volume is intriguing. I would like for someone to change my mind about it if possible.

$CRSR - Of course we all saw this one pop off yesterday. I am short term bullish, and very long term bullish, but mid term bearish. It has massive growth potential, but must overcome some resistance. I wrote a comparison between it and $ASO [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nz8c86/the_case_crsr_vs_aso/)

So these are the 7 stocks I'm intrigued in at the moment, for various reasons. Let me know what you think.

Key levels of support and resistance based in Fibonacci retracement. (25 weeks’ levels).

Price: $18.79 | $26.71 (25-weeks high) | $12.75 (25-weeks low)

$19.03 VWAP 

$18.08 (First support at 38.20% ratio) 

$17.69 SMA 50 Red line

$16.04 (Next support at 23.60% ratio)  

$19.44 SMA 100 Blue line

$19.73 (Resistance at 50% ratio)

$21.38 (Strong resistance at 61.80% ratio)

From May 14, 2021, to May 19, 2021, the share price rose 48% after a good earnings report and an order of 260 electric school buses, then the share price suffered a 12.5% setback and rose 30% to $23.45 given the positive industry momentum. 

On Jun 08, 2021 the stock was overbought at 74 RSI, the MACD crossed to the downside and the share price plunged 22% possibly driven by the recent supply chain chaos. 

Today the stock is in an oversold zone, the MACD is about to cross to the upside, the share price could achieve a 13.63% recovery to $21.38 

The electric vehicle market is expected to reach 233.9 million units by 2027. The global transition to electric vehicles continues to gain momentum. The US market is also poised for the second stage of growth, driven by federal, state, and municipal incentives and significant investment in public charging infrastructure promised by the new administration in the US.  Analysts give Lion Electric Corp (LEV) a 12-month price target of $22.00. Based on current technical indicators and due to the current uptrend in the EV stock market (if the recent supply chain chaos stops), the share price could achieve a 13.63% recovery to $21.38 (strong resistance at 61.80% Fibonacci ratio). 

Deals and connections from DD below:

* **Amazon** purchased 10 trucks last year and has a contract with Lion to purchase up to 2500 trucks by 2025.
* **Amazon** also has the possibility to own about 15% of LION electric if they spend 1.1B on the trucks. And there is a high probability that they will (see below)
* [Pride](https://www.electrive.com/2021/03/28/pride-orders-100-electric-trucks-from-lion-electric/)(big truck enterprise) as a purchase order of 100 trucks = potential for more orders if product is liked
* **IKEA**
* **CN** (huge Canadian transporter) recently [Purchased 50 trucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15U4DjRLkqA&t=41s&ab_channel=LionElectric) \- again there is a chance to increase size of order later
* First student with 260 buses for QUEBEC only. Guess what? they own 43 000 buses across Canada and USA which will slowly need to be changed into EV.
* Deal with **Heritage** for 100 Refuse EV trucks

Position: 1000 shares and 10 contracts for 7/16 $30

2021-06-16 13:24:05,wallstreetbets,"OP or anyone else ITT, what are some good call options for TTCF? I’m looking at the $25 October 15th 

What u guys think?"
2021-06-16 00:45:46,wallstreetbets,That’s a no from me

2021-06-15 21:01:24,wallstreetbets,"It's the lingo of this subreddit. Tendies refer to chicken tenders or chicken nuggets, the thing we get when the trades go our way, and we make money."
2021-06-16 08:25:49,wallstreetbets,"Not being able to keep an SKU in stock is not a sign of high demand, it is a sign that, whatever the demand is, over a certain time period, it exceeded what was ordered by that store.

Often, when a product is a slow seller, you place one order of the SKU, but not another because it is not selling quickly enough. Then, when volume declines, you do not order it again because it sold so slowly. Eventually it sells out. Then you use a different product to take its place. There are many SKUs that are not kept in stock. It is not always for great reasons. Given that all of TTCF's products are frozen and can be kept for a very long time, they are all bound to sell out *eventually.*

The biggest issue with this is that it does not expand the market. I am a devout carnivore and have a very negative view of vegans. I still tried Beyond Beef and the Impossible Burger out of curiosity. I ended up getting both again when I got bored of a standard chicken, pork, beef, lamb rotation.

I would not consider any of this company's products because they are: 1) Not novel 2) have terrible vegan flavor profiles 3) overpriced. Vegan food is super cheap and requires little prep. 

All of TTCF's products already have rivals in the market:

Cauliflower Mac & Cheese - Amy's, Lavo, Trader Joes

Cauliflower Crust Pizza - Newman's Own, Nature's Promise, Caulipower

Acai Bowl - Like, millions of competitors.

There is simply no moat. So, they need to win on scale. Against people who already have that in spades.

Out of all the things in the market right now, betting on yet another vegan food company with cheesy hipster branding is not what I would be doing. Choose your own path and follow your dreams, but make sure your dreams are compatible with reality."

I think out of all the meme stocks other than amc/gme this one looks like the best to ride up. The key is to STOP picking so many fucking stocks all over the place and just pick a FEW that we all buy into. Every day there are suggestions of 100's of more stocks though. WKHS is the biggest piece of shit there is. Fuck that one. If everyone just picked say(other than amc/gme) wish, bbby and maybe one more like a clov then all 3 of those would moon to triple digits. But now there's so many people on here and too many stocks where everyone is all spread out all over which makes it impossible to get a real meangingful drive up. AMC and GME BIG players, big apes and everyone else was on board. That's why they exploded."

2021-06-15 23:05:44,wallstreetbets,The insiders selling has already been addressed and is old news. It was the top 5 executives who  now have specific criteria on how much they can sell and when. They are all currently only taking $1 for salaries this year. The other part of tbis is a gambling company has a gambling subsidiary that may be doing illegal betting. This is all par for the course. All the money draftkings is spending is to dominate market share for whats coming at the end of this year and beyond as far as legalizing it goes. The hit peice isn't wrong but its also not that damning. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

2021-06-16 00:54:05,wallstreetbets,I would like to see where it was addressed…feel free to link your source..Also i can’t take u seriously if you you think insiders selling is old news….insiders have sold 38.8 million shares in past 12 months and 1.7 million shares in past 3 months..38.8 million is slightly less than 10% of all outstanding shares..Good luck if you think investing in a company where insiders have sold about 10% of total os in 12 months is a good idea…(https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/dkng/insider-activity) ..

2021-06-15 20:35:19,wallstreetbets,Well my first options position that got me started was actually DraftKings when it was still DEAC. Bought options for the name change. Did the same for nkla really early. Just hoping to catch some name hype. I’ve had blnk - RVLV - nio ttcf- that got me up to around 650k also have had some big losers in xspa and Eros and a few others. Rolling Gme options till the late January spike  really got me a big chunk though

2021-06-15 20:57:22,wallstreetbets,Yep - timing wise you couldn't pick a better year for stocks to moon. GME was a once in a lifetime opportunity IMO - you had the balls to take advantage of it before it became too popular as well.

2021-06-15 20:00:05,wallstreetbets,Sure more ITM open interest does indeed set up a potential for a gamma squeeze but it also gives the MM's way more justification to spend some money to manipulate the stock. Same thing happened last months expiry. Retail was keeping up with and slightly overtaking he shorts manipulation but as soon as the MM's teamed up with them the price was manipulated down.  Moral of teh story: at this point NO CALLS we need all the money in shares. Every call u buy gives the MM's more ammunition to manipulate it down. Very little to no options if u actually want this to work.

2021-06-15 20:04:24,wallstreetbets,"For a DD that isn't supposed to piss on CLNE you are doing your best by basically saying that UWMC is tbe better play. 

The float of CLNE and UWMC are similiar. Half of CLNEs float is held by institutions and mutual funds that won't sell their shares. They are both abou 70M if you take out the shares held by institutions.

I think it was June 3rd were 6/18 13 Call options went up a 1000% with a volume of 30 million. Stocks went up almost 20%. 

Gamma Squeezes come to life when there is a quickly rising underlying stock price with increasing interest in short dated Call options.

 UWMC was on a steady upwards trend for a good month now and I seriously doubt that they were retarded enough to not hedge any options especially when they are so close to being itm. They are preety good at calculating this.

The 6/18 C for CLNE specifically the strike at 13 talked about was at that time heavily out of the money by 5 slots but it had heavy open interest. The market makers very likely didn't hedge for this position yet.

Now when you have a bunch of retail that throws all their money into it and QUICKLY moves the price to the said 13. That's when you have your optimal gamma squeeze setup.

NOT when you move the stock one slot further to a position that has heavy open interst. You can always expect that they are already hedged for that.

Look at the past of GME, AMC hell even TLRY I think. Of course my own opinion. Could be completely wrong but yea. I think CLNE is the much better Gamma squeeze play here even tho I'm obviously biased. 

Not to mention that your DD lacks proof of the stuff you are trying to tell others about."
2021-06-15 21:03:26,wallstreetbets,The whole market got crushed with more to come tomorrow and you're still trying to push your garbage onto people because you bought options. Uwmc is a $9 stock and it will get crushed with everything else tomorrow. Maybe give the pumping a break for a day

2021-06-15 22:49:45,wallstreetbets,That’s not very ruhtarded though.
2021-06-15 20:56:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sure it could theoretically happen. But I think the price needs to go higher then above 10 or 11 and I think you would need to have way more open interest at the further away OTM strikes.

Remember they hedge for options usually before you reach them if the time is there. and before the deadline not after. So 10 is likely hedged. 11 might be also.   

Especially for 6/18 CLNE is just way superior atm and that's why this post is kind of a pain in the ass and that's why I even decided to comment."
2021-06-15 21:06:31,wallstreetbets,What the fuck happened to this place. We used to mock people for buying shares and now most people recommend it lmao

2021-06-15 22:35:23,wallstreetbets,"Your money, your choice. I sold a couple calls at a loss and bought more shares. But I’m still holding some calls in case we see a bump this week, and I’ve got calls in July too.

I think holding shares is a great choice with this stock. So if you have enough equity to sell and grab shares, might not be a bad play."
2021-06-15 21:10:33,wallstreetbets,Been happening for a long time I guess
2021-06-15 21:05:41,wallstreetbets,"I understand your sentiment but traction starts somewhere so I won’t fault the OP. I’ll need to look at CLNE but when you look at the float and volume of an AMC compared to a UWMC, things could run in a hurry if the volume comes in and blows through resistance  levels pretty quickly. I’ve been watching the Level II for and they’ve built a wall, but it can be broken. We’ve been seeing it with other memes this year."

2021-06-15 23:30:03,wallstreetbets,"Holy crap. This is like reading a friggin encyclopedia that gives 97% useless info and 3% facts I care about. You mentioned nothing about P/E vs Chinese competitors, future estimates, CHINESE-US diplomacy, and moats for NIO as well as competitors. If you did, I obviously stopped reading your book because it didn't tell me new things that the last year of EV explosion hasn't.

Xpeng is better than NIO in every regard except it's size.
-selling in Europe
-first mass produced Electric lidar vehicle EVER
-higher yoy growth, and mom growth
-more spent on R&D tech for all systems
-autonomous driving is better than teslas and can function in CHINESE CITY CONDITIONS!!!! (have you visited a Chinese city?? Wtf) 
-Affordable when compared to competitors
-Doesn't include useless luxury charging stations for customers to ""have an experience"" when charging. 
-regional gov backing I multiple regions

Xpeng has way more going for it than NIO and the stock prices show it. As does this guy in a year when I see more gainz than dudes trying to fight for NIO when other Chinese EV players are clearly better"

2021-06-15 20:56:26,wallstreetbets,"I was relaying things I had seen on the front page. I was given a book a few years ago that went into ethical investments and can't get myself to invest in companies like wisp though.

WISP - Shitty customer service, horrible return policies, knock offs and intellectual property theft all over the site, and garbage that you wouldn't ever buy at a dollar store if you held it in your hand before you bought it. Wisp also features a lot of  poor and or purposely deceptive product descriptions so that the products you ordered are not what you expected when they arrive.

There are youtube channels with whole series on wisp and shitty wisp garbage, a lot of them are super funny. 

So I don't care if it's worth 18 and is sitting at .005.

But you do you, and I'll keep eating these fat delicious crayons."
2021-06-15 20:59:44,wallstreetbets,"I don’t disagree with you as far as me not really liking the company itself. I wouldn’t argue with you whether it was ethical or not, but I would argue that it’s not a pump and dump, has solid dd, and is almost sure to go up. Although I’ve enjoyed my “cheap” things I’ve bought off of WISH and they have lasted me years."
2021-06-15 21:17:52,wallstreetbets,"Well it doesn't seem to have all that solid DD to me, it does however seem to have a bunch of people paid to talk about how great it is though. Someone has even posted screenshots but they could be faked. 

That's a super hard pass from me Bob. I am also super dumb as hell though.

My gut can be wrong and I hope it is, I wish the WISH apes well and good huntings."

2021-06-16 01:33:57,wallstreetbets,"This has been written in news about them being 2 for 2, so I don’t blame you, but it is inaccurate.  Hindenburg has written about dozens of companies, and have been horribly wrong at times in the past.  For example, they said in Dec. of 2018 that their report on Aphria would  be “devastating to the stock price” and they couldn’t have been more wrong.  I agree, do not disregard, but they’ve been wrong in the past and also their report on Nikola was far more damning than this one on DKNG (hey, I just realized if you typo DKNG you end up with DONG.  Neat!!).  Nikola they basically uncovered the entire operation was a fraud and a sham, there was more extensive evidence, and with DKNG the accusation is not nearly as bad."

2021-06-15 22:16:12,wallstreetbets,"Preordered a truck. If stock moons ironically use it to become an owner.

Gf also think its ugly. Spit purchases are fun.

Will go nicely with my jeep gladiator 😜"

2021-06-15 21:11:22,wallstreetbets,Fellow bag holder here!! 50 @ 17 🥶
2021-06-15 22:17:20,wallstreetbets,Their pr is awful. Months go by with very little news even though they are testing the hell out of the cars.
2021-06-16 09:00:47,wallstreetbets,15 mang and I thought it was a steal then down about 40% in a week.  Oh my mistake it was Caannoo the EV rickshaw company i should’ve paying attention.
2021-06-16 03:23:28,wallstreetbets,"It was an options 10 bagger last night if people had them, didn't myself unfortunately"
2021-06-16 02:59:11,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck don't I have the elder thing in my name? How many years do you need for that?
2021-06-15 23:42:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah for real it's so odd because their whole design ethos seems to scream social media influencer, but it's like they don't even exist outside their website lol. I guess to some degree it's good to just keep your mouth shut when things don't seem to be going your way so maybe the blackout has been wise"
2021-06-15 23:53:06,wallstreetbets,"I don't want to speak too soon, but they have been better as of late with PR."
2021-06-16 01:19:38,wallstreetbets,They have their final 2 contract manufacturers which they will choose this quarter. This partner will be a stop gap until the Canoo factory is built. Canoo is going to save hundreds of millions (according to their own words and SEC filings) with these negotiations with state and local leaders as well as these potential contract manufacturers.
2021-06-16 13:35:00,wallstreetbets,My guess is two based on how long I’ve been here
2021-06-16 15:57:23,wallstreetbets,"They actually have a really good PR team, too. Their videos are super polished. I'm guessing they're intentionally remaining silent so they can start to build momentum when the time is right, rather than getting a ton of public awareness and attention when the car is still a year away from the market. Maybe they just don't want people to lose interest between their PR blitz and when they can actually sell cars."
2021-06-15 23:04:45,wallstreetbets,Tony said that 80% of there workforce is involved inR&d so they are making some good shit.
2021-06-16 16:51:33,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think this makes total sense. Like they're so far away from selling a product why bother - after all the point of PR isn't really to attract investors as much as customers
2021-06-16 01:15:12,wallstreetbets,You just tried to compare a designer to an engineer with 30+ years of experience in chassis.
2021-06-16 01:16:38,wallstreetbets,Speculation
2021-06-16 00:18:50,wallstreetbets,"Very good points you've raised here, I've never thought about it like that."
2021-06-15 22:20:58,wallstreetbets,"All of those companies apart from Tesla make shitty cars. Nio is popular in China because it's backed by the CCP. $GM hasn't made a decent car in like 40+ years, $FSKR MIGHT be onto something, but his cars just look like any other SUV out there, and then of course Tesla which reigns supreme. $GOEV at its current valuation is a steal. Cheaper production will ultimately put $GOEV on top. Plus, they can pump out new models in like 1/4 of the time since they all share the skateboard platform and have wireless steering."
2021-06-15 20:04:56,wallstreetbets,I'll believe any elliot wave saying I'm making a 5bagger.

2021-06-16 03:42:30,wallstreetbets,Would love to see CLNE have the MOAGS. But I’m in it long either way (obviously selling if there’s a squeeze in hopes of rebuying lower). Anyone ever notice Thursdays seem to be gamma squeeze days? Wonder if we’re teed up… 🐄💨📈
2021-06-16 04:49:16,wallstreetbets,Never sell in the red. Just a reminder to you all. Stocks almost always recover. Just be patient.

I picked up 227 shares at 11.01 today. Meant to get $250 worth of $12 strike call options for this Friday, but need to take care of some account stuff first.

By the way, anyone look at the upside for $20 strike call options? I took a gander and was really impressed. Maybe next time.

Let's see where this goes"

2021-06-15 21:34:21,wallstreetbets,I wonder if the apes could buy up 100% of the shares and just never sell. Would be a status symbol to own AMC shares
2021-06-16 04:01:17,wallstreetbets,"Even tho the stock price isn't reflecting that atm. Props to you for making CLNE one of the most mentioned tickers here on WSB. 

When I saw the first DD here on the apeland I wouldn't have thought that it would get so far or find any support at all.

Glad that this one was also my first DD on a stock. I hope some of my memes get approved by the mods so I can have fun with it this week and if the 13 works out then great.

If it doesn't we will at least have less pressure from shorts and only hae TOTAL fucking up the share price LOL."

What about those apes who buy AMC at $300 and get trampled running for the exit?  
fuck 'em, right?"

Clean energy is a very hyped field (with hype bubble just having burst), and currently there are a ton of bag holders that will drive the stock down for many months to come.

Finally, solar will win clean energy, not gases.  There are very few use cases for natural gas in an all electric world.

EagleTree is just taking your $ to pay off their debt they borrowed to buy the company & once that debt is paid down via inflated sales of their common equity (that they’ve specifically defined as NON-VOTING shares), they will create preferred shares for themselves, and will dividend the profits to themselves from there out, rendering the common shares worthless. This would be pretty criminal had they not LITERALLY STATED THIS IS THEIR PLAN IN ALL OF THEIR SEC FILINGS, beginning with the S-1 stating the purpose for the IPO as only intended for debt pay down and they have no intention (nor are they allowed to, given debt covenants) to distribute any profits to common shareholders. You’d honestly have to be even more than half retarded to buy this class of stock from them. They’ve designed it to be free debt relief without giving up control and have the absolute ability to render the shares valueless with the stroke of the pen, absent any ability for common (non-voting) shareholders to do anything about it."

1)Strike Price
2)Expiration Date

The longer it takes your option to expire, the more you’ll pay for the call option.

If the strike price is below the current valuation of the security, the option is worth more (will cost you more to purchase) and we call that in the money.

If the strike price is the exact same as the cost of the security, we call that “at the money”.

If the strike price is higher than the cost of the security it’s worth less and costs less and we call that “out of the money”.


Your goal when buying calls is for the security to go up and go as deep into the money as possible.

Then you can sell (sell to close) the call option for a profit."

2021-06-16 01:05:51,wallstreetbets,"Your problem here is that you’re assuming them reducing their common shares has an actual impact on their control of the company and ability to retain its profits. In this case, their control of the board remains regardless of their equity % and there’s nothing you or any other shareholder can do about it, even if you own 99.9% of the outstanding common shares. Once they get all the capital they can from selling worthless common shares, they will simply create a preferred share class for themselves with accumulating dividends at x% rate that will balloon into an exorbitant amount owed to them, which will be required to be settled / paid to them when they finally do divest. There will be nothing left for common shareholders. I’ve executed > 100 LBOs as part of my day job but I have no idea what I am saying and this is definitely not financial advise. Just read the fucking financial FOOTNOTES & S-1 for Christ’s sake. The fundamentals / recent growth and future growth prospects at high margins look phenomenal. Problem is the class of equity you’re buying will never see any of the profits due to lack of any control & ability of current owners to render common shares worthless at any time without any mechanism to prevent them from doing so by anyone other then…themselves…"

2021-06-15 20:20:59,wallstreetbets,"Here, I wrote this earlier and might shed some light on CLNE for ya. Best of luck whatever you do!!

Alright, last time I’m going to do this. For all you brains with out cells out there this is why CLNE is the play right now and what she does.

1.	⁠⁠CLNE is the king of renewable fuel used in vehicles. They process methane waste gas from any source they can including animal shit and rotting fruit. They inverse the carbon footprint by processing this into fuel rather then burning it off.
2.	⁠⁠Huge deal with Amazon to fuel their delivery fleet vehicles.
3.	⁠⁠Hugh upside, low risk company knowing that green is the future especially under this administration
4.	⁠⁠The price is right at these levels. Shares are better then options
5.	⁠⁠Market cap is 2.5 billion, meaning it’s small enough to be bullied in either direction massively if needed
6.	⁠⁠6/18 $50,000 worth of calls go in the money if the share price closes at $13 a share or above this Friday. What this means is that the share price will skyrocket next week when funds settle

CLNE is a strong buy. If if the gamma isn’t triggered, this company will do very well in the coming weeks. Therefore it’s a low risk to take for the reward. Best case scenario, we gamma squeeze and make money. Worst case it doesn’t gamma squeeze and we make money in the next few weeks.

Not much risk in losing money when you invest in a good company like this. Bagholders also recover and make money.

🌕🐄💨💨💨💨

EDIT: Stupid apes can keep buying the flavor of the day and keep holding bags or chasing winners and never get ahead.

Smooth brained apes can understand the risk/reward benefit of rolling profits into CLNE and make some serious cash.

Here’s hoping to strolling down Tendieland Blvd with you all next week!!"
2021-06-16 06:33:44,wallstreetbets,Lllol nah
2021-06-15 21:57:15,wallstreetbets,Also calls risk
2021-06-16 01:17:53,wallstreetbets,"BTW this is a very common technique PEs use to purchase private companies from founders / less sophisticated owners for a steep discount on the actual enterprise value. For example - purchase price is stated as $100m; PE purchases “80%” and give seller rollover of “20%” except 80% PE equity is a new class of preferred shares and seller’s equity remains common and subordinante to both the PE’s preferred dividends and - wait for it - the debt payments the Company now has to make going forward. The PE with a majority stake declared dividends that accumulate and any exit proceeds need to first pay lenders and then the preferred dividends to the PE and then the 20% common shares to former owner - except by the time lenders and preferred dividends are paid there’s nothing left for common shareholders. So basically they were under the impression they received $80m for 80% of the business but really they sold 100% foe $80m instead of $100m. Pretty fucked, eh? 

This is a classic case of the numbers don’t mean shit because the legal terms dictate where the earnings go and in this case those terms are designed to give you a massive enema."

2021-06-16 08:23:01,wallstreetbets,"Dude. Appreciate the long ass response. I’ve clearly got some reading to do. Thank you.

I am curious why black rock and a few other tutes do own a substantial number of shares, and why Goldman Sachs would underwrite their non dilutive offering in January if all you say is true?"
2021-06-15 23:32:44,wallstreetbets,"Nah I don’t, I’m still learning myself lol, I tried searching it up too and I don’t see anything on something called a “collect call”."
2021-06-16 08:45:25,wallstreetbets,"I’ve done a number of deals with Goldman involved. I wouldn’t get too hung up on the name. Their IB department is mostly young kids straight from Ivy League who are smart but know jack shit about M&A. Their management allowed the underwriting because a) they would make money and b) they literally disclose what they’re doing so there is no risk. If you think about how the underwriter makes a profit, as long as the shares sell above their strike price they make $ then and there. Clearly this occurred and they made profit (so much so that there was a follow on offering - this means the shares did well enough that they sold even more and made even more underwriting profits). Once they sell the shares into the market they don’t have any more risk, it’s only on the actual initial offering date if there isn’t enough interest would they have risk, but that has long passed."

No mentions of additional tariffs. Trade bans. Etc. This isn't going to have a significant impact IMO.
2021-06-15 23:37:48,wallstreetbets,So ur saying if we try to cut China off from their new influence they won’t do anything.  Couple hours after we got mad at them they flew planes over Taiwan as show of force over what they believe is theirs

Looking at his post history Elon is obviously a good (or lucky) investor and has multiplied his money this year. That doesn't make him WSB. He's probably into all kinds of SPACs and shitco1ns.

Now, if I would be you and I would take 3k out the 10k and be ready to give it to the homeless guy in the corner by your house, means I would not care to lose it or give it away I would then jump in the game without any issues.

I jumped in buying stock, then when I understood the buying and sale of the stock purchase then I started learning about options.

My first 1k in options was wiped out in one week simply as that, It did not bother me at all, I took it as learning experience.

The thought part of this game is to fine someone who has been doing freaking fantastic like the guy who published this gain to give you the lesson or couching because everyone don’t trust anyone because everyone can be damage in court by advising.

If you are lucky and someone take you under his or her wings and guide you the you could make Sirius money in this game.

By the way, everything I wrote here is not and advise is only my opinion.

Good luck pal."

2021-06-16 00:08:56,wallstreetbets,"Congrats!
I just started working for one of the bigger, reputable, brokerage firms, which I'll leave unnamed, but I've learned A LOT about trading through the training. Going from completely ignorant to very slightly less ignorant. 
I just do technical assistance so I'm no broker or anything, but it's neat seeing all the inner workings.

That being said, after researching for hours, I dipped my toe into the water with buying only 3 shares of AMC when it was at $44. Seeing it up at ~$60, and even that little bit of growth, is SO invigorating. Im having a blast getting into this community.

I am pretty worried I'm overestimating myself and setting myself up to be suddenly bummed one day, but that's just how the game seems to go and I learn best by just jumping into the fire. 

I can only imagine how you feel looking at your charts. Serious congrats, man."

2021-06-16 00:10:04,wallstreetbets,Now what if it’s not in a TFSA jw
2021-06-16 13:40:47,wallstreetbets,Can you trade options under TFSA?
2021-06-15 23:11:58,wallstreetbets,"Okay, so in 2021, you have a Capital Loss of $15,000. You can write off $3000 of that loss against Ordinary Income, leaving a $12K carry forward.

In 2022, you have a loss of $10,000. You take $3000 off against Ordinary Income. That leaves $12K - $3K + 10K = $19K to carry forward.

In 2023, you have a $15,000 gain. Your losses carried forward offset  your gains: $15,000 - 19,000 = -$4000. You may take an additional  $3000 loss to offset ordinary income: $4000 - $3000 = $1000.

Your carry forward to 2024 is $1000."
2021-06-16 01:45:29,wallstreetbets,"When you have a realized gain and then a realized loss on the same stock, you start to enter the realm of those messy Wash Sale rules.

Best to avoid Wash Sales if you can."
2021-06-16 07:56:07,wallstreetbets,"If you don't want to pay taxes, don't make money.

If you want to make money in the casino, you gotta come to terms with reality: ""Nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes."""
2021-06-15 20:52:50,wallstreetbets,Yes. Any holding over a year is taxed at the long term rate. Regardless of how big your gains are.
2021-06-16 00:13:13,wallstreetbets,That’s life bro government is the biggest scheme know to man
2021-06-15 22:51:36,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the lesson! I really appreciate it!
2021-06-16 13:56:51,wallstreetbets,"It is unfortunate, but I've been reading this sub long enough to expect the downvotes on comparitivly basic questions. It's an ape-eat-ape world in here. I also know there will be someone like yourself, who will help a retard out.

I've watched YouTube and read  ""investing for dummies"" type sites to explain options. There were other folks in here who also explained the math of the profit on OP's screen shot. It was the percentage amount that I could not resolve. Where the hell were they getting 6700% increase on his Jun 18 call? I saw the same crazy high percentage on my own trade. I got into this game (like so many others) while following the GME short in January. I bought 3 shares of GME and 15 of AMC. Still have the GME. Sold my 15 AMC yesterday at 60 (bought at 12). The Ameritrade app said it was a 4000-ish percent increase/profit. 900 is not 4000% of 180. Of course, I cannot find that screen today. When I saw that percentage amount I realized there's is other math at play (these damn kids and their new math!).

I want to thank you and the others  (even the down-voters because they keep life interesting) for taking the time to educate a dumb-ass! I'm looking for the next stonk to grow my paltry fortune! Target, here I come! No more WalMart for this guy!

Edit: grammar/spelling"
2021-06-16 03:34:08,wallstreetbets,"Well, with things like CFDs they do class it as gambling because you're just spread betting 🤷🏽‍♂️ but real share ownership is ownership of a company where you profit from the operation of the company and dividends... and with commodities you're buying and selling commodities for a profit so its not much different from owning a shop."
2021-06-16 00:27:07,wallstreetbets,"Roth IRA is the easiest in general, takes very little to set up, just don't gamble all the money you put into it away because you can only put in so much per year and withdrawing early results in taxes. The tradeoff is that you can completely ignore capital gains taxes and thus wash sale rules and whatnot in an IRA, which makes it extremely efficient for short term gains as well as long term ones.

Unless you make absolute bank in the account, do not withdraw early since that results in taxes on the gains. It's an investment account you aren't normally able to pull money from until retirement. I believe you can pull some money out to buy your first house, as well as a few other exceptions (I think you can withdraw contributions, though I don't know if that's trivial), but otherwise your money is locked in there for good."
2021-06-16 00:13:09,wallstreetbets,Then you pay capital gains tax
2021-06-15 21:19:57,wallstreetbets,Should add the loss write off is lost if the same or sufficiently similar security is repurchased within 30 days.
2021-06-15 23:15:49,wallstreetbets,"Great thanks. To confirm, the $3000 limit for losses carried forward only applies to non-investment income, and there is no limit to offsetting capital gains with losses from previous years?"
2021-06-16 02:02:16,wallstreetbets,If other stock?
2021-06-16 02:02:54,wallstreetbets,I have had wash out sale losses on other stocks😅
2021-06-15 20:00:34,wallstreetbets,They can start by not handing out money to people who don’t need it.
2021-06-15 23:16:02,wallstreetbets,Fuck this guy
2021-06-15 21:06:02,wallstreetbets,"Why is that?  I like having no lead in my water, roads without potholes, and hope that the next generation of children will be better educated.  Money for that stuff comes from taxes."
2021-06-15 20:24:35,wallstreetbets,I like the stock too
2021-06-15 20:00:39,wallstreetbets,"Looks like my military is showing(thank you for the thanks). I get alittle aggressive sometimes... Ok let me go full APE here. This post is about a person with lots of calls and 90 shares (if I am reading it correctly). That being said if the stock goes to 10-100k a share, that's $900-9M. When you are purchasing multiple homes, (to park your money and start having it work for you) a heloc wont do. Heloc's are primarily used for primary homes and depending on the bank second (vacation) homes. That being said I personally dont think a heloc will be your best choice. Whether you are buying one or more homes. 

Let's say you in this scenario you dont want to double your money (minus 20-30%), then you can use a cash out or heloc to only pull out ONLY your taxes owed. Alright let me stop bashing heloc's; if you only want to take out a small amount under 100k, then a heloc is for you and you can find it fixed rate out there(typically higher interest rate). Go to you credit unions they will help you out. Any more then I would cash-out(lower ""national"" interest rate). Its all about the interest, I dont like paying the banks. And let's face it, if I get luck money then I want to buy the biggest home my money can buy. That's why i would buy a home first vs giving Uncle Sam his first. A little long winded but hope that helps."
2021-06-15 23:26:43,wallstreetbets,"I don't love the idea of YOLOing the money I plan to live on in my way-too-fast-approaching old age. 

They say ""diversify."" So I figure, keep some in safe investments and have some to play with."
2021-06-15 21:06:19,wallstreetbets,"Since max contributions on an IRA are capped at 6k a year it would be unlikely that you could yolo your entire life’s savings. But yeah, feel free to yolo the money you do have in an IRA on individual stocks!"
2021-06-16 00:15:20,wallstreetbets,"In Canada, 50% of the value of any capital gains are taxable. Should you sell the investments at a higher price than you paid (realized capital gain) — you'll need to add 50% of the capital gain to your income. This means the amount of additional tax you actually pay will vary depending on how much you're making and what other sources of income you have. (That’s what I just read on Google 50%!!! Wtf!!! That’s retarded!)"
2021-06-15 23:15:09,wallstreetbets,"There are lots of fiddly rules. 

If you're making Wash Sales etc, consult an experienced tax preparer."
2021-06-15 20:10:46,wallstreetbets,Let’s skip of the trillion dollar defense budget
2021-06-15 21:11:45,wallstreetbets,Very insightful I had never thought taxes pay for those sorts of things. I'm now glad I pay 37% in tax and LeBron James makes 100 mills per year to play basketball.
2021-06-15 22:22:33,wallstreetbets,It is lol. I use it for my Roth IRA. I will soon be moving Robinhood and Webull stocks to it.
2021-06-16 03:57:37,wallstreetbets,Love fidelity. Been with them since i worked for the death star
2021-06-15 20:45:04,wallstreetbets,"Not trying to be pedantic, but with a Roth IRA the gains and contributions are also not taxed assuming they came out correctly and not early. That said, it’s important to know that for any of the IRAs you pay a 10% additional tax if withdrawn early on top of the tax they already cause if not a Roth and you don’t have a hardship reason. So if you want access to this money now it is better to keep out of the IRA (also CPA who does taxes)"
2021-06-16 00:17:48,wallstreetbets,"50% is added to income and taxed at a rate depending on your other income…. not 50% is removed from tax, which from your shock it sounds like you took it.

AKA

You make 100k salary.

You make 100k off stocks in a year.

Your income for the year is 150k.  100k normal, 50% of your 100k gains.

EDIT:  I am a simple ape,  I am somewhat new to trading.  This is not definitive advice, consult a legal expert ir do your own DD before figuring out your tax/savings strategy."
2021-06-15 22:46:59,wallstreetbets,Damn I’ve never been inverted before
2021-06-15 20:13:10,wallstreetbets,I’m just salty that my working 2 days a week because schools were online 3 days a week and daycares weren’t open but they wouldn’t give me money even though I didn’t full out quit. Meanwhile I know people who had no need to quit let alone work less full out quit their jobs and are still taking the free money now that school is out (was 4 days in my area in April) and are riding it all the way to the end date. It makes no sense.
2021-06-15 21:24:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah rich people playing games will keep making money as long as people still want to pay them to do so.  LeBron probably pays taxes.  But you know something, LeBron still gets a paycheck from someone else.  LeBron is rich, but he's not wealthy."
2021-06-16 03:57:10,wallstreetbets,Fawks hard
2021-06-15 23:04:31,wallstreetbets,I like RH interface....so simple....buy...sell...but yeah ROTH fidelity plus work 401k rollovers from old workplaces = stonks

2021-06-15 20:22:48,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, man. We live in a time of abundant wealth and technology and yet many of us are crushed but the weight of just trying to survive. I sincerely hope your days become less stressful."
2021-06-15 20:19:27,wallstreetbets,"yooooo! I DIDNT KNOW THATS THE SHIT YOU HAVE TO GO THRU!!! hooleeeeey fack, from one ape to another, im so sorry... you have every reason to be salty.. if i was you, i'd be preserved by now"
2021-06-15 20:29:12,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I’m in a somewhat okay place now. I was able to liquidate some crypto I bought during the peak of 2018 (had $1600 turn into $250-300 for over a year) for around $3200 and was able to stay afloat until I was able to actually work again. Now I’m trying to figure out how many part times I want to juggle. Started at UPS for the $18.50 their paying right now; if you work a double shift it’s $27.75/hour. I figured I’m already pretty broken, can’t get any worse. Trying to get another job but not sure if it’s worth risking being unavailable for the double shift for a consistent/reliable $10-whatever I can find (had a walk in interview where they offered me $10 to work anywhere from 2-6 hours 2-5 days a week).

The fact that there are crazy amounts of jobs and I can willy nilly walk into a place with a collar shirt and a smile and get an offer (albeit not a great one) on the spot is pretty telling. If WSB taught me anything it’s that the chance to work 4 hours for $27.75 is better than guaranteed $10/hour at 8 hours. Pretty staggering difference."
2021-06-15 21:26:20,wallstreetbets,Best of luck my bro
2021-06-15 21:32:22,wallstreetbets,Thank you friend. You as well. GME ape btw. 1 at $100 and 4 around 173. Diamond hands.

2021-06-15 20:14:07,wallstreetbets,"Yep your edited version of events sounds correct, wash sales are handled partially. That sounds normal, plenty of companies can outpace tax-advantaged strategies with higher overall gains regardless of tax impact. Lol no need to apologize! Good luck with your investing!!"

2021-06-16 15:36:51,wallstreetbets,But what’s yard work have to do with the stock market 📈 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-15 21:07:45,wallstreetbets,Join the club.
2021-06-15 21:05:45,wallstreetbets,Can you explain what that is?
2021-06-15 22:31:02,wallstreetbets,"Well, now we know. I'm going back to the tried and true tactic of just buying low, BEING PATIENT, and selling high."
2021-06-15 23:47:16,wallstreetbets,Funny you say that. I just did that with NKLA.
2021-06-16 04:59:36,wallstreetbets,"You sell for .05 and tell yourself next time don't wait until the last week to get out of an option that is so far out of the money.  If it's a normal stock and not a meme stock you should have already known three weeks ago you were never gonna make it to $20.  If it's a meme stock that just crashed in the last day or two the lesson is dont buy short expiring options in meme stocks (or get out while you're ahead and take some profits).  If the price is 0.05 that means someone is willing to pay 0.05 for it, there is always another retard willing to pay $5 and hope for a miracle."

2021-06-15 21:22:26,wallstreetbets,Bragging about buying high  and selling low and then posting your losses. It used to be a thing.
2021-06-15 21:22:53,wallstreetbets,You must be new around here
2021-06-15 23:48:37,wallstreetbets,That's what I tried doing and took the profit and put them on other stocks. I guess I chose things that already hit a peak then decided to ride through a valley

2021-06-15 21:29:10,wallstreetbets,Your basic point isn’t wrong but your comment is why so many on this board have gotten smoked in options or experience theta crush and don’t know why. It’s not simple. Most people trading options spent a TON of time learning before making a trade. Maybe you did too. The fact that guy took the time and explained the basics and gave that guy a jumping off point is legit.
2021-06-16 08:52:02,wallstreetbets,"Dude you’re a retard, smh. That whole post was perfect for someone who doesn’t understand what options are for"
2021-06-16 05:10:39,wallstreetbets,No it’s a real stock and has a sell price of 0.00 and a buy price of 0.01. I know big mistake letting it get this close.  I guess I could roll them over but kinda want out from under them
2021-06-16 16:21:16,wallstreetbets,"Yup, still sounds slavey 🤣"

2021-06-15 21:23:43,wallstreetbets,"I am, yes."
2021-06-16 19:27:20,wallstreetbets,So you hold until they come back. Use dollar cost averaging to reduce the overall loss.

2021-06-15 22:18:53,wallstreetbets,Things like IV crush are only learned from experience in my opinion... you can read about it all you want but until you see your own option drop in value for no apparent reason you will never quite understand it.
2021-06-16 05:13:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah your money is dead at this point then.  Generally you should never hold this late unless you're just on the edge of getting in the money, but even then I'd probably cash out just to prevent the option from expiring worthless.  If this is a stock you like and not a meme stock and you think it's gonna make it to $20 I'd buy LEAPS that don't expire for at least a year. It's gonna cost you more premium but you're gonna have a much better chance for it to actually make it to $20."

2021-06-16 11:52:54,wallstreetbets,"Yep. That's why I bought calls on the news to hedge my puts. The rise in IV also actually covered a lot of the damage on my puts funny enough.

I didn't realize this was news... did anybody really think they weren't going to try and fight it?

I think they couldn't get the contract because of their manufacturing capabilities. They already can't produce enough trucks. They had to lower their target from last year due to supply chain issues. Oshkosh will probably just end up making a higher amount of electric trucks then 10%, because they are capable of doing so."
2021-06-16 11:57:33,wallstreetbets,The mail contract was the underlying reason GM practically gave Burns the Lordstown plant. WKHS was always going to subcontract to LMC. The Endurance and the WKHS NGDV are built on the same skateboard.

2021-06-16 18:11:23,wallstreetbets,"I think Cummins conference call may be very useful for you.

Cummins is a world leader in Diesel engines and was able to buy at 6x sales Hydrogenics, which is the only fuel cell & electrolyzers company in the world with serious pipelines in both the segments 

Cummins basically said that until 2025 the hydrogen segment will manufacture only electrolyzers, and most of them won’t be for mobility applications (green hydrogen for trucks) but for heavy industries needs. After that, maybe, they will start to sell some PEM fuel cells in large numbers. Hydrogenics is having problems with the hydrogen train in Europe, that is the best application you can find from an economic point of view (it is failing for the cost of the electrolyzers and the fueling station)

Cummins is begging government for money for r&d and infrastructure spending because it won’t happen a hydrogen $CLNE that spends billions to build a nation wide network. Single hydrogen stations for trucks are too expensive and require much more efforts that natural gas ones as u/Nrdrage was saying 

That is, as Cummins ceo said, natural gas is going to be a bridge tech whose time span extension is impossible to identify. 

Said that, by 2030 we will see multiple solutions coexisting  and if natural gas takes a 20% market share, $CLNE network will become extremely precious"

Initially I was like no way I’m selling, fuck you…. But as the days went on that became harder and harder. I held down to $80 which was brutal to be honest, but after losing $10K (>80% of my value) I just couldn’t stomach it anymore…. I realised that although I could “afford” to lose what I’d put in, I wasn’t comfortable with it. I “paper handed”, and “rescued” what little I had left. I slept like a baby.

They continued to drop it down to $40ish, and I was happy with my decision…

Of course we know what happened next. It shot back up to $300+, but only after about a month or so. I could have made it all back easily. But I couldn’t have known. I was pretty convinced the game was over (to my dismay!).

2021-06-15 21:41:48,wallstreetbets,"Well I don’t mean to correct you because you know your stuff but the market average like the S&P lifetime average is actually about 10% isn’t it?


I understand your reply though. Cool!"
2021-06-15 22:53:28,wallstreetbets,"I think it’s around that in the good years.  The high need retirement estimates are around that.  I think over the entire modern history it may be that.  I don’t remember the exact scale by the 7% iirc is for over long periods.  

A quick check says it’s for periods over ten years which I think is why I went with that number since taking the entire population as the sample can skew results."
2021-06-16 02:10:55,wallstreetbets,"It’s actually 10% on average over its entire lifetime, I just googled it and checked again which is what I remembered. People say 7% because inflation averages about 3%. That’s at least I’m pretty sure why 7% is used, and some fraction of people probably say closer to 7% for their index portfolio because historically you’re supposed to include bonds which have lower returns but less volatility."
2021-06-16 09:00:29,wallstreetbets,Quite possible.  It’s been over a decade since I looked at those numbers.  And you’re quite right on the bonds/stock mix which also accounts for the lower return.  I think that’s why the conservative retirement estimates use 5% instead of 7% since the bonds will lower returns.
2021-06-16 11:50:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, for my calculations I actually use about a 6.5% real return factoring in inflation. Apparently the mask it’s a little weird too, even though once you factor in inflation you can still get like 7.5%, when the market dips and comes back up it’s harder to make up from your losses so I apparently 6.5% is a good real number after inflation. 


I always chase the safe withdrawal rate. Apparently I can use about 4% of my investments in perpetuity and that’s the golden number for me."
2021-06-16 11:55:13,wallstreetbets,Yea all those numbers track.
2021-06-16 17:53:49,wallstreetbets,Good stuff. So do you have any tickers you currently like that could possibly be good 30 day plays?
2021-06-15 23:44:44,wallstreetbets,"Hey no need to apologize, you are now better than 99% of the 10M *shareholders* here! Wsb has always been about options so feel at home, It's a start and soon you will be buying FDs with the real retards. 

As momoney says in his reply, a smaller delta value could have a larger risk/benefit profile. Have a look at the greek value called delta for your option, the more your call is towards 1.00, the more it behaves like leveraged stock. If its == 1.00, then the contract behaves like 100 shares, so if your stock goes up 1$, your contract goes up 100$. But if you paid 10,000$ for a 1.00 delta contract, that's only 1% of profit. If you buy options with a lower delta, the value of the option is smaller compared to the delta, so you get bigger % swings for the same stock move than a delta 1.00 contract.

In case you don't know [www.optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com), check it out. You can use it to simulate different options, and you can bookmark those. Compare how much they gain / loss varies depending how long is the expiry.  You really start to feel time decay starting from the last 6 weeks and it accelerates (expoential)., so you don't feel theta decay much if you sell 6 to 4 weeks before expiry. 

It's basically a graphic Black Scholes calculator, you can find those online and play more easily with the variables (but not a graph output).  Like for your leaps, maybe the interest rate becomes a factor as they are long dated and that figures in the BS equation for option pricing. When the 'risk free interest rate' (interest on bonds) rises, riskier options need to be cheaper to be interesting, so that affects the price downwards. 

Basically, its a game of balancing risk and benefit (strike and days to expiry) vs cost (IV)."
2021-06-16 12:04:49,wallstreetbets,Hey thanks for the info it will greatly help me in the future and thanks for the welcome to wsb see you on the moon my friend
2021-06-16 12:53:11,wallstreetbets,"Good luck! i think you are off to a good start, i mean you picked a long expiry first so it's not very volatile so it relatively safe and relax play, you wont have it expire worthless before you realize what's happening, and you have time to learn while you watch it.  Most people go for the cheapest ones but those are usually expiring very very soon, or very out of the money 9that's what i did lol).

2021-06-16 01:32:32,wallstreetbets,This aged well...
2021-06-16 13:27:10,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. Plus they have $430m of cash and only $43m liabilities giving them a few years of runway if needed for development. They’re in a much better position than their competition. Easy buy.
2021-06-16 02:22:50,wallstreetbets,whats your average now?
2021-06-15 23:59:52,wallstreetbets,"Holding since $28, but majority of shares bought at $40-50"
2021-06-15 22:58:24,wallstreetbets,">Because AMD is going to generate massive profit on Epyc sales for the next two years. 

How many more are they going to sell then now, considering the fabs already can't print them fast enough? Will they increase price, because they're already making them as fast as they can sell them and their EPS is not great, what is the plan they talked about in the investor call to resolve their biggest hurdle, supply?

> Well in excess of analyst estimates.  They're going to make massive market share gains.  I don't think analysts expect them to go much beyond 30% of that market, and I fully expect them to get closer to 70% in 2 years time.

They would have more right now if but for their manufacturing limitations, contracts which are set in stone up to 2 years ahead of time currently with the shortage. You can't make market share with a product you can't produce enough of

>AMDs consumer chips will be in short supply now for a long time, because they are devoting fab allocation to Epyc to satisfy that sales channel.

Shortages are a huge problem of they're trying for market share. People need computers and servers, of they can't get an AMD they will buy Intel. We see it right now at my work, we're unable to get AMD procs for our servers so we just but Intel. Same with desktops and laptops"

2021-06-15 22:57:59,wallstreetbets,"I like Petco, but I worry about their retail side.  They need exclusive products to set themselves apart from Amazon, Walmart, and Chewy, who I think are their biggest competitors.  The vet side is a huge plus as long as they aren’t cutting costs too much.  A killer app for ordering and pickup would be a huge plus.  Overall, Good fundamentals but I can see the hesitation and makes sense to see the sideways pattern."

2021-06-16 13:32:01,wallstreetbets,"In stage analysis, you've got your stage 1 bottom, stage 2 rise, stage 3 top and stage 4 decline. I would argue VLDR has been in a stage 4 decline since its $29 high in Sept 2020.

This could change at any time, but as a shorter term technical trader, I try to ride the existing trend, and the current trend of VLDR is a clear down down down. 

Buy low sell high is a myth. The pros buy high and sell higher."
2021-06-16 13:34:42,wallstreetbets,And it clearly bounced off the strong $10 resistance line and forms higher lows since. Your stage 4 has run its course IMO.

2021-06-16 16:07:31,wallstreetbets,"I like to find exhausted/oversold stocks with good fundamentals and apply a combination of sma's that vary depending on the time frame (5min, 15min, 1hour, 1day, 1wk) and solid horizontal support/resistance lines for entrys/exits  (especially on the 1day and 1hr) plus sudden volume spikes  (relative volume of course) as possible indicators of a reversal. Still learning of course and Im sure there are many other indicators, but from what the ""pros"" are saying in books/podcasts, they typically master only a couple indicators and ignore the rest. 

Im also currently focused on options as the profit potential is parabolilc compared to stocks.... so is the loss of course."
2021-06-16 08:39:21,wallstreetbets,"The main reason to invest in Vuzix is it's IP portfolio.  It has patents regarding waveguides and it's manufacture.

Probably impossible if you need to work around it's IP.

2021-06-16 15:49:57,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. I've been on PPIs (protonix, prilosec, prevacid, nexium; mostly either nexium or prilosec I think) for like thirty years, and I've never heard that from any of my doctors. I've been told it can decrease bone density, which I'm fairly certain is true because I've become rather brittle since my early thirties. I'm not a big drinker, but I was for a few years in college, and I never had any issues drinking (even heavily) on PPI drugs, whatsoever. I handle my liquor just fine. I'd have to get totally blacked the f out wake up in the street drunk to have a bad hangover. 

Maybe alcohol is totally different than I've always thought, since I've probably never been both off PPIs and drunk simultaneously :O"

2021-06-15 21:17:38,wallstreetbets,">	That you fail to see the value in “work experience”...

You seem fooled into thinking there is a career path or progression for those roles, while ignoring that they are humans trusted with food safety, cash handling, and often cash reconciliation activities. 

Unpaid internships, minimum wage hourly jobs with no benefits, and tip based wages are all jobs that frequently take advantage of people - whether they are looking for gap work, flexible work, or trying to crack the door on an industry that expects you to ‘earn your stripes’. 

>	...you are worth your skills and experience in the job market, no more.

You are an absolute fool if your view is this simple. I have worked around people significanly overpaid and underpaid throughout my life. Many of the people I know that worked minumum wage (or close to) jobs were because they were in a difficult situation and that was their only choice due to distance, schedule inflexibility, or because it was 2nd/3rd job that they could easily say no to."
