Meaning you would need enough equity in your account to purchase 100 shares x the amount of contracts you want to exercise. If your options are up and you just want the profits from them just sell the contract, not exercise it."
6/23/2021 19:56,stocks,Ahh okay makes sense now. Thank you. This whole time I thought they just gave us stocks we can buy out w.e lol
6/23/2021 19:57,stocks,If they gave you options they do expire so make sure you do something with them before the expiration date. :)

6/23/2021 19:45,stocks,"While the rally since the March 2020 bottom has been insane, if there’s one thing I’ve learned the last year is to not think emotionally and just hold. You might get stuck holding a bag for awhile but if you keep investing on the way back up you’ll profit even more in the long term"
6/23/2021 19:30,stocks,"I'm diversified across a few industries/sectors, including banks. The bank pullback hasn't fazed me at all, but literally five seconds before finding your post, I was eyeballing my positions in JPM and BAC, and deciding that now is a decent time to increase my share count by 5 or 10 percent. 

Also on my to-do list tonight is to refresh my DD on CWEN, a profitable clean energy-utility hybrid that has been beaten down this year, and I am likely to add to that as well. 

So tl;dr, you're on the right track imo. Don't fear ATHs, but always look for opportunities, and I think banks and energy have a little bit to offer at the moment."

6/23/2021 19:36,stocks,The stock market is a good place to make money if you have a lot of time - and there is no woman counting on you to do right by her. Right now there is a lot of weird volatility - a likely crash approaching - and an entire band of apes trying to remake the way the market works for the little guy. In your position? I would not buy stocks... Good luck with your woman.

6/23/2021 19:03,stocks,"for this short amount of time, assuming you're ok if you take a loss(it's stock market) you wanna look at ETF. try to pick some safe ETF (won't suggest any in particular, due your own DD and verify the risk you're ready to take)
do not invest in single stock. Enbridge for example could have been a disaster with a different decisions by Michigan."
6/23/2021 19:38,stocks,Could lose half
6/23/2021 19:50,stocks,If you're looking to make some decent relatively short-term gains. I'd say do your research and pick some affordable stocks that you're comfortable with to buy in blocks of 100 and sell covered calls.
6/23/2021 19:22,stocks,Check out $PBA ($PPL.TO since you're Canadian) very nice pipeline company with a proven track record and an ever increasing dividend on the monthly instead of quarterly. Currently paying .21/share per month set to increase to .23 at the end of year. I'm in for 300 $PPL shares and 5 $PBA call options at $35. They currently in a bidding war with Brookfield infrastructure to acquire Inter pipeline which would make them the second largest pipeline company in North America
6/23/2021 18:56,stocks,Honestly just buy AMC and GME tomorrow and thank yourself when shorts cover #amc500k
6/23/2021 19:07,stocks,"A year is a pretty short time horizon to put into single stock investments. If it were me, I’d just leave it in a HISA rather than risking it in the stock market. Take advantage of HISA promos and bank hop. The promos usually last 3-6 months, so realistically speaking, you can make a guaranteed ~1-2% return just by bank hopping two or three times. 

I think it would be much safer if you put the money into some sort of index if it really *needs* to be in the market for that short of a time. Something like XEQT or VEQT is a good global diversified option for Canadians (assuming you are since you listed all Canadian companies). VFV is vanguard’s S&P index."
6/23/2021 19:47,stocks,I would look more at some conservative ETFs or mutual funds than individual stocks

6/23/2021 19:50,stocks,"Haha, all good. I'm honestly not too worries about not being able to afford the wedding when the time comes. I have other materialistic investments I could sell when the time comes if needed. I am abit nervous about a crash and was also thinking of possibly just investing 50% and putting the other 50% in savings. If there is a big crash like when covid happened, I could put more in."

6/23/2021 18:20,stocks,Tanker stocks should go up from their currently depressed levels if there is more oil to move.
6/23/2021 18:31,stocks,"Those are just the additional sanctions imposed by Trump. Pre-Trump sanctions remain. Tankers are reacting already but otherwise it sounds more like Iranian propaganda at this moment. I do hope i am wrong though. I miss the Iranian business (I am old-ish and not American, I remember a time when you could deal with Iranians)."
6/23/2021 18:51,stocks,"Iran has their own tanker fleet, though.  I have to think refiners are the.winners here as oil price arbitrage opens up while demand keeps refined product prices elevated.  If this dents Brent prices, it might hit the international oil and gas names that are moving on the $100/bbl hype.  Adding Iranian production back into the mix puts a lid on that scenario. 

What is the likelihood that Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait pump like mad to depress prices and keep the Iranians in check and block their ability to get north of $70/bbl for their production.  Not likely the local players are going to sit idle while their major foe rebuilds its economy."
6/23/2021 19:38,stocks,"This is one of the items that was added to the agreements to appease Iran. Sounds like this isn’t a sure thing according to what US officials are saying, since Iran needs to approve of the expansion of the nuclear deal in their talks."
6/23/2021 18:28,stocks,Danggggggg they are all super cheap right now. Any recommendations? Maybe there is an ETF w a few of them?
6/23/2021 18:38,stocks,I see. So their oil is still being sanctioned to an extent?
6/23/2021 18:32,stocks,"I bought cheap options on them.

Some are dirt cheap right now.

I’m just putting what I don’t mind burning away, plus already had bought stocks on them before… most already up 50-100 per cent. Just bought options just in case it goes up even more.

So options is a great way for me to have more exposure without putting portfolio allocations way out of whack."

6/23/2021 19:04,stocks,Employee reviews (on Glassdoor and Comparably) are an extremely underrated investment metric. Top talent is scarce and gets to pick where they want to work - good companies that attract top talent outperform the market. I never invest in companies that have mixed or negative reviews. On the other hand companies that have extremely good and believable reviews (4.8+++) often put up great growth and product development.

6/23/2021 19:21,stocks,The average retail investor never touches options. What are you talking about?
6/23/2021 19:30,stocks,"18 months ago I would have agreed with you. Now the “it” thing is yolo’ing into near ex OTM reaches and either getting wiped empty of hitting the lottery.

6/23/2021 18:41,stocks,"I'm not going to comment on TRCH-MMATF specifically, but a general thought...

After GME/AMC, there's a total mania out there about short squeezes. All the people with FOMO from missing out on those are now frantically looking around for some other way to get rich quick. The climate is ripe for opportunists to rip off eager retail.

At a glance, it looks like TRCH is a worthless company which is looking to fuck over the shorts who (rightly) predict they'll be out of business soon, so they're doing some convoluted deal with a dividend of non-tradeable preferred shares (?) which is confusing and hard to evaluate and anyone with experience realizes well enough to stay away.

If you think you'll outsmart some deal devised by penny stock promoters, shady security lawyers, and short sellers based on due diligence written by some Adderall-fueled apes on reddit, best of luck to you. But the odds are better and the drinks are free at the roulette wheel."

6/23/2021 17:24,stocks,Dad always said there is money to be made in the market whether bullish or bearish. Key difference is the amount of educational material one is to read up on before going balls deep into X stock or Y mutual fund. That separates the winners from losers.
6/23/2021 17:28,stocks,"Timing the market is hard.  We might run up another 30% before the next 20% drop. 

As long as your horizon is long term and you don't need the money soon, it's foolish to pull out.

6/23/2021 17:26,stocks,"I agree, but even 18 months is a long time away. I plan on staring to liquidate when we get closer to rate hike. Then basically hold cash and try to time it."
6/23/2021 17:41,stocks,"1st: For every negative scenario you listed above, there are dozens to hundreds of stocks that thrive under those conditions.

2nd: Never time the market. You will fail. Empirical evidence shows you are better holding current positions and DCAing when the market swoons. You will 100% come out better than the dude trying to time the bottom."
6/23/2021 17:53,stocks,"In the event of rampant inflation, the worst place to have your money is in cash. The second worst place to have it is in bonds. The best place to have it is in leveraged real estate, and after that, in other equities. So putting money into the market right now is not a horrible idea. 

When the FOMC begins raising interest rates, there will likely be some frothiness to the market, but it isn't going to turn belly-up just because of that. That's not to say that the markets might not turn upside down at some point, but it'll be for some other reason. Something that we aren't foreseeing at this point."
6/23/2021 18:02,stocks,I agree valuations are high and it pays to be a little cautious.  But there are not a lot of great alternatives right now. Cash you are losing 5-10% per year to inflation.

People did have *valid concerns* regarding a possible ""impending crash."" People were worried about P/Es, they were worried about all-time-highs, they were worried about the presidential election, they were worried about the stimulus, they were worried about have far down the market would go during the Covid crash, etc.

If the market crashes tomorrow, I'll just buy more. You might be right that a drop will come in 1-2 years. It remains to be seen if the market stays down."

I get your point but the saying really doesn't apply here.  If he stays in cash, he is literally solvent."
6/23/2021 17:23,stocks,I love watching retail massacre the hedge funds with the naked shorts. Keep it going. Doesn't change the fact though that the market is now unstable.
6/23/2021 17:54,stocks,Well you wife's BF is true. There is more money in circulation than actually exists. There are a lot of market levers to pull to keep it going. The problem is when you run out of levers and we are.
6/23/2021 19:44,stocks,Let's make this simple: you can't predict the future with the past.
6/23/2021 17:24,stocks,"Time in the market > than timing.

People have feared crashes for years. The chance you time it right is a toss up; you could never see these prices again if it keeps growing for 2-7 years before a crash, or the crash isn't huge."
6/23/2021 17:23,stocks,What so anyone who disagrees is a gambling addict?
6/23/2021 18:00,stocks,You are right. Most of my money is tied up in commodities specifically steel. Covid protocals world wide impacted the means of production. And every educated country was trying to build infastructure while there were no people out. Demand outweighs supply and steel futures remain quite high into 2022. I have done my research and i believe in the thesis. Which is why im not fearful
6/23/2021 17:29,stocks,Yeah you're right. This will probably be the first time in history that the market crashes and never recovers. You've got it all figured out.
6/23/2021 17:55,stocks,There is a massive upside. You don’t need to hold any position longer than a few minutes to make money so to say we should be all cash rn because of a crash you think is gonna happen in 2 years is ridiculous
6/23/2021 17:26,stocks,Then perhaps put your money into reverse leveraged ETF’s..
6/23/2021 18:36,stocks,"Serious question. For someone so fearful, why are you in the market at all?"

6/23/2021 17:28,stocks,No there will be stocks that always win. You pick the right one and you win. What I am saying is there is an obvious correction coming and people keep thinking right now stocks are the answer to get returns. Even at a minor 10% market correction it still can hit hard.
6/23/2021 18:02,stocks,I made a good return on X (US Steel) but as traffic and commodities change fast its also uncertain.
6/23/2021 17:32,stocks,"Correction, not crash. The market will correct and you will see a mass dip then you pump money back in and even with no research you'll make a decent return."
6/23/2021 18:34,stocks,Read every post. Everything he has said is ridiculous. Come on’ you don’t take your financial advice from every Reddit soothsaying wizard??
6/23/2021 18:31,stocks,"I'm being generous with 2 years, it'll happen in 1. The point is that people are going in thinking they are going to get some return that matters. Maybee 3-4%.... maybe they get lucky and choose a hot stock and get 10%+ or a loss. Who knows. The fact that this group thinks the market is a stable place to put money is insanity."
6/23/2021 17:35,stocks,"Thats a good point but where are retail investors getting that info from and why they should do it. Usually dumb ass sites like motley fool, business insider, yahoo finance, etc. RETAIL investors follow the mass."
6/23/2021 19:39,stocks,hmm. I guess I did. Go fact check them and let me know what you come back with.
6/23/2021 17:45,stocks,Inflation is more about buying power than currency.
6/23/2021 18:20,stocks,"Did you read the intro or anything I said? Property is being artificially inflated by investors buying retail property....... Commodities are bing ruined because of trade wars, Bonds will start looking up next few years but not yet. Right now the market is tapped out so dump money into it for no reason. Right now Cash is King. Yes I know inflation (aka the boogey man) is telling people if they don't invest they will lose money on potential investment returns but negate inflation. Which is wholly inaccurate."
6/23/2021 18:24,stocks,"Federal Reserve is a private entity the US Treasury is a gov owned, do I need to elaborate on what they do like how there are many branches of the fed reserve?"
6/23/2021 18:17,stocks,Sounds like a smart man.
6/23/2021 17:36,stocks,Ahh i misunderstood. What do you define as a correction? And why is it obvious? Cause id argue last week was a correction for most of the market. But im assuming you think its going to be significantly larger? And correct me if im wrong but if you pull your money out and inflation happens that stack of cash you pulled out will be worth less then after the correction anyway.
6/23/2021 18:29,stocks,"If you are so certain, why aren’t you and your magic 8-ball placing massive put calls?

Rather than pull money out, I will continue to put money in.. why? Because I have my safety net already solved for, and putting money in to safer holdings that I won’t need for 15-20+ years. 

Not everyone is gambling on stupid Meme / start up tech, spac……"
6/23/2021 17:51,stocks,"If the crash happens in two years time, it probably wouldn't drop below what you were in for when you cashed out. 
A crash will always recover in a few months anyhow. What you are doing is gambling on timing of the crash."
6/23/2021 19:42,stocks,So why are u here in the stocks Reddit?? 🤔🤔🤔
6/23/2021 17:51,stocks,"Okay but if you pulled all of your money out and are holding it as cash for fear of a market downturn over the next couple of years then you aren’t even an investor at that point. You’ll just be losing money anyways because of inflation eating away at the value of your cash. You’re letting fear and paranoia drive your actions. You should take your inflation concerns and weigh them in with fundamental analysis of overall markets to get ahead of the masses. If you were right, wonderful for you! If not, have risk management and learn from it. Having cash during a time of inflation is like slowly burning your money away dollar by dollar."
6/23/2021 17:47,stocks,and what happens to your buying power in an inflationary environment genius?
6/23/2021 19:42,stocks,"Oh good.  So the US Treasury is the only entity that can print money.  Most people hear the Fed is printing money and think of German or Venezuelan hyperinflation where treasuries printed money into oblivion; that is not what the Fed is doing now or after GFC.  

Inflation fluctuates; the Fed thinks CPI will oscillate to the higher end of its range by 2023, at which point it will start raising rates and flattening the yield curve.  Routine.

I’ve worked in HNW asset management since 2004; right now is full bull mode.  We are on the cusp of early stage recovery moving into mid-stage expansion; it’s actually kind of routine. That being said there is one 1x 10-20% correction per year on average, so expect that.

I also don’t know where your getting the insolvency thing, saving are through the roof.  

So long story short that is why people ~~are~~aren’t cashing out right now."
6/23/2021 17:42,stocks,"Correction meaning that 10-20% across the board for 2-3 months, not a week swing. Look at today how the DOW went. Not just one industry. Of course there will always be some winners. The market overall is in for a correction, its historically proven and now there are things we have never before seen happening. 

&#x200B;

Those things happen to be collapsing mass funds which judgement says...... won't bode well for stability."
6/23/2021 17:59,stocks,I'd argue against this completely having liquid assets to move freely across different investment vehicles does not mean you are not an investor.
6/23/2021 17:51,stocks,"Well if the current thesis holds true and people are in stocks and they all get corrected and lose 10-30% value and you hold cash..... You inflation is 10% You may net neutral? So evens out? Or it goes further in the market and information doesn't hit as hard and now you have buying power. 

So as you questioned I guess I'd say, Cash is king because the market can wipe your buying power out faster than inflation can."
6/23/2021 18:25,stocks,Dude are you trolling?

Don’t do this."

6/23/2021 17:21,stocks,"Thank you so much. As someone who's only started trading in the past 6 months or so, I probably needed to hear this."
6/23/2021 18:01,stocks,"I just buy what I think are solid investment to hold for the future and only sell when I need to and it makes sense. I’m planning for the future, don’t use margin or options, and won’t get reked. I’m guess I’m just conservative lol"
6/23/2021 17:41,stocks,"The biggest mistake new traders make is not planning their exits. There should be a trigger for exiting to take profit and a trigger for exiting at a loss. Don't let the profits ride (don't get greedy), don't let a losing trade keep losing more money with the hope it'll turn profitable.

If you set up your trades correctly, you'll know exactly how much you'll make if you're right and how much you'll lose if you're wrong. There should really be no question here.

It's amazing how many people I see posting here and other investing/trading subs asking if they should take their profit yet or if they should take their loss. That's something you need to think about *before you enter the trade*.

This also helps take all emotion out of the equation if you are disciplined enough to stick with your plan."

Your words.

Sidenote though, if you do ever yolo into pennystocks, do a lot of DD and pick 10 of them, heck actually pick hundred or even more, hold for years, some types even decades, and then just sell every one of them that moons, don't pick anyone that is at its peak.

Then again pennystocks is kinda uhh, so much extra risk, mining companies can have their permits declined, which renders the entire company absolutely useleless, medical stocks with actual products can still go down more than 90%, not to talk about all medical stocks who doesn't get their crap approved or can't distribute it into medical field, or company can decide to do so much stock offering/dillution that they raise few hundred mils from retail investors while earning few mils a year.

Or maybe, maybe the kids Netflix or Chinese shopping mall or airport testing centers wasn't such a great idea afterall by end of the day.

I guess those yolo people don't think that far."

6/23/2021 18:34,stocks,"I think that it’s a good add on though that if you are buying and holding something, to do a valuation, and based on that, set a price target where you reassess the valuation. If things have improved, continue to hold, if not, then that would be the trigger for a sale. Even stable companies can end up being displaced, and it’s important to assess things like competitive advantage regularly too."

I find most who YOLO often have issues with just basic saving money so they never foresee themselves having enough capital to work with.

If you save and bank good returns, nothing wrong with taking some of those gains and throwing it on some option or stock that might be a 5-10 bagger.

I wouldn’t do all my gains in YOLO…that just me though."

6/23/2021 16:44,stocks,"There’s a lot of reddit sentiment against this deal but it’s definitely a hold. I would not take out money to put in Verizon for sure. 

Look at it this way, the deal was announced and the stock has basically traded flat. That tells you there’s a lot of wait and see going on here from larger institutional investors, aka, the smart money. They’re holding, so why shouldn’t you?

They’re holding because, for the time being, there is a very solid dividend that isn’t changing prior to the the deal closing. How many high dividends do you know that are basically guaranteed not to be slashed before mid 2022 at the earliest, with a stable stock price? 

Then there’s the upside. T is shedding debt, slimming down, and focusing on their core business. This is exactly what the street and large investors have wanted. Plus, they still get 71% of the high growth streaming business, which is considerably more valuable than just HBO Max alone. 

The new company could command a high valuation given that it will be a big theee streaming competitor—if you like Netflix and Disney, Warner-Discovery will be right up there. 

I bought into T believing that the company was more valuable than its stock price based on the sum of its parts. Now that value is being unlocked. 

We’ll see what the new stock ends up trading at, but I’m putting my money on T and NewCo being valued more than T was alone. It seems the market agrees it’s a reasonable possibility."

i think the warnermedia spinoff has a real chance to be a successful company, as there's a lot of valuable  IP's in there.

it  sucks that the dividend is getting slashed, but my plan is to simply hold what i've got, enjoy the  next year or so worth of dividends, and then see what happens post  spinoff.

i'm reasonably confident things will be successful for both att and the warner spinoff (my understanding is that T holders basically see their shares split into T and the new  company, so current holders will have both), but uncertain enough i'm not necessarily adding to my position.

only way i'd sell off is if it has an insane run between now and then and starts trading for $40-$50/share (which won't happen)"

What I am saying is: If you're going to be profitable within 24 months everyone wants a piece of the pie, but if you're going to be wildly profitable in 2025 it is hard for institutions to invest *now*, which is most of the money.

Only way for now.

Sportradar will be IPOing soon, and depending on the valuation I would much rather have Sportradar.

> Not only are they partnered with the NFL but $GENI won the exclusive distribution rights for NFL official data in April. They beat out their only main competitor, Sportradar.

They won by paying a princely sum for it, ~3x the $40m Sportradar was paying and they're paying for half of that in equity. I get that growth is coming but that literally represents 90% of their PY Sales revenue.

I generally like both but I have to roll my eyes everytime I unbalanced DD with literally no bear case."
6/23/2021 16:09,stocks,"I like your post, but you don’t have ANY account history apart from three years dog pictures. Sus."
6/23/2021 18:04,stocks,"Valuation aside, is there any other reason as to why you'd choose Sportsradar? 

Agree there's no bear case in the OPs statement, but I personally can't see any reason to want SR either. GENI's basically got all the major sports partnerships (US and abroad) and they've been on an spending spree to position themselves well for the next few years. They've more than funded themselves for that spending with share dilution recently, including 8m shares from mgmt (which is insane unless you already know you're gonna make more than you would have without that dilution).

I can't see the same for SR who seems to be losing their battles left, right and center. They lost the NFL contract and tried to go SPAC at 10b lol."
6/23/2021 18:37,stocks,"I am welcome to bear cases, I apologize I didn’t include them in my dd.

While sportradar does plan on a traditional ipo, geni is the only option at the moment so what I said isn’t false although it doesn’t look like for long. If sport radar can get a decent valuation I will buy some of that as well as they represent a duopoly in the market. If the valuation is the same as when they planned on spac route (10 bn) I will not touch it. So we will see if the spac valuation experiment taught them anything.

They did pay alot of money for the NFL contract but I do not see this as negative either. A lot of companies have loss leaders and if this is what this turns out to be than that’s ok. NFL is great exposure and with their model they should be able to fully entrench themselves into that ecosystem. On top of that this is included in that deal:

**Another element of the partnership with Genius Sports gives the company the right to distribute live audiovisual game feeds to sportsbooks in international markets, while it will also represent the NFL’s legalised sports betting advertising inventory across the league’s owned and operated digital platforms domestically and internationally.**

Geni gets 5% of all revenue from sports books using their data so will be able to make money internationally off this deal. I will admit I don’t know how much of an appetite there is for NFL outside of North America though."

The largest drops leading up to this point were due to unable to finish their projects in their pipelines (bad results and no approval for new drugs).
Today, the head of the development department announced he will be quitting later this year.

It's not looking good, but there is some hope:
They have got an enormous cash position and they still have some products in the pipeline that *could* make money in the future.
Their current valuation is extremely low, but more professional analysts give the company a price target of it at 85 euros for the end of the year.
Keep in mind that these analysts are Belgian and probably have a boner for/position in €GLPG (note: Galapagos is both noted in $ and in €)

I'm holding, average buying price: 89 euros, will probably average further down soon to 70."

Certainly he realizes that if he had paid the taxes he thinks he should have paid then he wouldn't have nearly as much money now to be giving away. As he says compound interest and a long road, every little bit saved in taxes early on translates to much more wealth later which is now bragging about giving away.

The expert: What happens in the banks is a mystery - usually foreshadows a crash

 The US banks' overnight deposits with the Fed have exploded and are currently even larger than the central bank's support purchases.  Exactly why the banks do not dare to sit on the money overnight is shrouded in obscurity, says investment bank Carlsquare's Anders Elgemyr to DI TV.
 - This is a typical reaction that usually happens in the crashes, he says.
 Elgemyr emphasizes that the Fed and perhaps also the Riksbank know what is going on - but the markets have no idea.
 Even if the concern continues, it is a buying situation because the Fed will go in and save the markets, he tells DI.

Depending on your plan, you can either exit then or continue to hold. 

A couple small cap stocks which I have large positions in: 
- $UAN. A nitrogen based fertilizer company. Looking for at least a double from here as fertilizer prices are expected to remain extremely high due to low supply, high crop prices, and China potentially limiting exports on urea. There’s some great research on it both on Reddit and Seeking Alpha. (1000 share position)

- $QRHC. A nano cap waste management company who has successfully completed a turnaround and is now back in growth mode. There is a good write up on r/securityanalysis. (5000 share position)

- $NWARF (Actually I own the ticker on my local exchange in Norway). Norwegian Air, their balance sheet is now significantly improved and they are ready for travelgeddon. (10000 shares).

6/23/2021 11:11,stocks,"Disney is a long-term stick to hold…not one likely to make you rich or anything, but one to beat the market perhaps.  They have plans with their parks but it takes many years to realize those plans, so anything on that front is slow-growing.  The parks did reopen but you have to see what happened since they closed.  They list a lot of revenue from the parks closing, while doing very well with their film and licensing acquisitions.  So Disney plus sort of made up for a lot of that to keep the stock from really going down a lot during the pandemic.  

The acquisitions they have made have been very smart, in my opinion, and what that will translate to is the parks regaining their income flow as a base for which the films and licensing are the X factor.  They have recently done a very successful crossover with Sea of Thieves.  It is not the kind of thing to likely yield them a ton of cash, but it is the kind of success to likely make them reconsider their front as a gaming outlet in collaboration or by themselves.  

In short, I think Disney long-term is a good stock that will likely go up and has the capacity to beat the market…it’s just not a gangbusters stock that is going to make you a ton of wealth.  But it also comes with a lot less risk than other ventures.  The mouse has shown resilience for a lot of years.  Good purchase in my opinion."

They've delayed a few film releases so they can be exclusive to cinemas. There's tons of live-action remakes of their classics in development, with huge stars attached.

&#x200B;

Their parks are just about reopen and slowly loosening regulation on masks etc.

But then I did  a google search and found two sites where the wording is strange and is probably the reason for OP's question.  For example from this [Yahoo finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-announces-4-1-stock-121421565.html):

>The split is conditional on approval from shareholders at the company’s Annual Meeting to be held on June 3. Upon approval of the split, each shareholder of Nvidia *as of June 21*, will receive a stock dividend of 3 additional common shares for every share held. The shares are to be distributed after the close of trading on July 19, and trading on the newly split shares will begin on July 20.

This [Motley Fool article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/08/shareholders-approve-nvidia-stock-split-heres-what/) has near identical wording.

That does actually read as if only those who owned shares on June 21 will have their shares split.  But I can't imagine that is right because people still can buy shares between 6/22 and 7/19.  And what, their shares are not going to get split?  That makes no sense.  

I think you are correct that anybody who owns shares on 7/19 will have 4x as many shares on 7/20 at 1/4 the price.  But yeah, the wording confusing.  Seems like the 6/21 date is irrelevant to me so kind of confused about what they were even trying to say there."

6/23/2021 14:07,stocks,So are you saying NVDA isnt worth its price? And how do you determine if its overpriced? And is it the same as how someone else is analyzing it?

6/23/2021 16:33,stocks,"Thanks!  Your post inspired me to look up stock split ""record date"".  Found this explanation [here](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/stock-split/):

>Record date: This is an important date when it comes to accounting, but it isn't terribly important for investors to know. The record date is when existing shareholders need to own the stock in order to be eligible to receive new shares created by a stock split. However, if you buy or sell shares between the record date and the effective date, the right to the new shares transfers.   


So I guess it's kind of like they take a snapshot of all outstanding shares on 6/21 and those kind of get labeled ""split eligible""?  And I suppose the only time this might come into play would be the rare case where the company maybe issued some new shares between record date and actual split date and those wouldn't be eligible?  Anyway, cool.  Probably spent way to much energy trying to figure out what that date meant, but good to know!"
6/23/2021 14:49,stocks,This makes no sense to me. Let's say I had no NVDA shares as of 6/21. Then today I go out and buy 10 shares and hold them till 7/20. You're telling me I am not going to have 40 shares at the new price? How many shares will I have?
6/23/2021 14:37,stocks,"You said it yourself, you are thinking price goes up based on psychology not on what it actually does. Factually speaking a stock split is a nothing burger other than psychology.

Technically the right way to value a company is by how much money actually makes/can make. I have no doubt in my mind that NVDA is a fantastic company. That in no way means that it is worth the current value. 

The best way to really value a company is by imagining that you can never sell it. The only way you make money is if the company will generate enough earnings to send it to you via a dividend one day. As of right now NVDA would have to move mountains to one day dividend out enough cash to justify it's price. It could literally double for 3 years straight and then grow at 25% every year after and then you'd get your money back after 10 years. That would be insane growth and mean it basically wins the entire dedicated GPU market forever. 

If it grows at a more consistent 25% forever it will take 14 years.

Consider these figures are not even discounted at any interest rate. Everyone is investing as if rates will be <3% forever. They very well may be but is that a good way to base the success of your investment?

So yes, I think it is overpriced."

6/23/2021 14:47,stocks,"I would add one last thing. Lay people invest based on psychology mostly because they don't understand how to do a valuation. 
Analysts do a few different methods of valuation. Discount cash flows, dividend growth, price to sales, etc. At the end of the day there is no ""right"" way because yeah P/E means nothing if you know a company has a top notch product. You'll value it on growth/total addressable market/market share etc. However, analysts tend to give rosy pictures. A lot of it has worked because low rates mean debt to grow is cheap and high valuations mena the company can raise a ton of money from shareholders to fuel growth. 

With higher rates, debt payments slow down growth, lower valuation multiples, and that all tends to slow growth even if you have an amazing product. Uber/wework/Lyft/Tesla and and many others prob would have gone bankrupt if rates were at like 10% for the last decade."

I admit the language does read the way you have interpreted it but that just can't be the case.  The only way the value of my 10 shares would stay the same is if the split applied to them.  Because no matter what on the morning of 7/20 the value of each share is going to be 1/4 of what it was at closing the night before.  There aren't going to be 2 different share prices for NVDA, one pre-split and one post-split.  So either the split applies to me (and I now have 40 shares) or I just took a 75% loss.

6/23/2021 0:00,stocks,"$FIZZ looking tasty Let’s start with the basics: National Beverage Corporation is the Ft. Lauderdale, FL based parent company of a number of carbonated soft drink brands that you’ve probably heard of and have likely tried in your lifetime, most notably: La Croix, Shasta, and Faygo.

What makes them a long term buy: They’re competitive among much bigger firms ($KO and $PEP) (think $AMD vs. $INTC). They’ve been consistently increasing market share and profitability. They’re more vertically integrated than competitors: They own both the production and distribution facilities.

They’re actually profitable with a good long term track record (unlike a lot of other companies being hawked on here). They pay dividends (but not always regularly), and have decent P/E at 25.47 (which is better than KO and the industry average). While slightly less than average EPS at $1.83 is good, it’s better than KO, and they have had huge EPS growth at 42% in the last 12 months. FIZZ has a 16% profit margin while PEP is only 10%. Last but not least, they have almost no long term debt!

Technically FIZZ has been a steady gainer as well, with 82.7% 12-month price performance and 20% 6-month price performance. They had a 2:1 split at the end of February this year after paying out an enormous $6 per share! special dividend at the end of January.

Earnings is coming up (edit) 7 JUL. It’s expected to go down compared to last quarter, but a surprise beat might give the price a bump. Worth noting here that they’ve beat earnings estimates on the last 5/6 periods.

Here’s a couple news articles recently published on FIZZ:

They've essentially raised prices by selling in packs of 8, not 12. This puts them at price-parity with Pellegrino, Topo Chico and Perrier products, which actually sell real spring-fed mineral water, not carbonated municipal water.

In terms of valuation they really arent cheaper than anyone else either. Check the fPE. 

* FIZZ 23.9
* KO 24.7
* PEP 23.7
* KDP 21.5

Generally speaking, DKP and PEP are likely to have the best growth moving forward. PEP for their diversification to snacks and KDP due to coffee strength. KO is probably going to show big gains this year due COVID previously hurting their restaurant rev/earnings. They also restructured a lot by divesting bottling in order to improve margins. Not sure how that will play out but their earnings dont seem to have been hurt.

I dont know... Id need to see what they plan to do 1st."

ITUB is the largest private bank of Latin America. 

It also bought 49.9% of XP Investments which is the leading brokerage here and it's growing above 100% yearly, they say it's going to be the new Schwab.

When it comes to solidity, everyone knows that USA banks are involved in all kinds of fuckery, I would never let a penny into an USA account after I take profit of my investments. 

ITUB has over 300% of collateral needed for banks as per 2021. 

The financial system structure of Brazil, I can tell you my friend is the number 1 in the world and this happened because we suffered from hyper inflation a few decades ago and all the fears that you guys are afraid now. 

We suffered from scammers as well, that's why all the banks developed strong security systems. When I take a look at how ""secure"" are the USA banks it just makes me laugh, you guys adopted the 2nd factor not too long ago. 

Does that means we won't suffer from this anymore? Absolutely not, everything depends on what our government does, but it's unlikely. We don't have a FED printing money like it's nothing. About our Central Bank, by law it was declared independent to avoid political interference. 

When it comes about investing in Brazil, take note we are talking about 1 dollar for 5 real (our currency is called real). Everything is cheap to invest here aka lower valuations and that's what Buffet always take care. 

How deep do I know about financial market? Well, I'm a financial advisor here and I also set international investments for my clients. That's how I know how things work in USA, Europe and Asia.  


Now for the article, it's talking about Nubank. It's a financial start up that emerged to cheapen financial costs for their costumers, the thing is: They never profited since they born. But the startup environment is way different from a traditional company. Usually they burn cash to acquire market share and that's what Nubank is doing, they already have 35 million clients as per 2021/may. 

Buffet and other investors bet is that when it comes the time, Nubank can become profitable and then the valuation will explode even more. My only concern is: with 35 million people used to not pay any kind of account or credit card tax, how Nubank will begin to demand this? 

Regardless, most of Nubank clients are students and low income workers and don't get me wrong, but that's not exactly the clients you want to make a huge profit. But, there are rumors that they are planning an IPO and probably that's when Buffet will take the most advantage by selling his investment with an inflated valuation direct to the market. 

That's my 0.02 cents. Tried to explain the best."

6/23/2021 0:00,stocks,"UPST with a new partnership NXTsoft (nxtsoft.com), the market leader in secure, comprehensive and complete API connectivity, and Upstart (NASDAQ: UPST), a leading AI lending platform provider, today announced a partnership that will enable Upstart to more efficiently implement its all-digital AI lending platform to any U.S.-based financial institution
Upstart’s AI model leverages over 1,000 variables and advanced machine learning algorithms to enable more accurate risk-based pricing and greater automation. With Upstart, bank and credit union partners can approve up to 3x the number of borrowers at the same loss rates as traditional FICO score-based models1 with near-zero default rates2. In addition, Upstart offers an all-digital lending experience to borrowers allowing them to apply from any device at any time with over 70%3 of funded loans being fully automated with no human interaction.

As a result of integration with NXTsoft’s APIs, financial institutions will now be able to more quickly integrate Upstart’s AI platform into their existing services. NXTsoft’s OmniConnect has established API connectivity to 99% of all U.S-based core systems and can provide API connectivity between these core systems and any ancillary fintech solution. NXTsoft has been in the API marketspace for over 25 years and has numerous partners and over 1,000 financial institutions that currently utilize its OmniConnect secure API solution to transmit data real-time between core systems and ancillary applications.

“We want to help our bank and credit union partners quickly and successfully deploy Upstart to lend to more creditworthy borrowers through a modern, all-digital experience,” said Michael Lock, senior vice president of lending partnerships for Upstart. “NXTsoft offers Upstart-powered banks and credit unions a proven approach to integrate our AI lending platform into their existing core systems and workflow to accelerate time to value and be in market with a new offering for their customers.”

Upstart was created to help solve the massive inefficiencies in the credit market. For thirty years, the industry has relied on credit scores and a handful of variables to make lending decisions, resulting in very inaccurate assessments of a borrower’s true credit worth. As a result, only 48%4 of consumers in the U.S. have access to prime credit even though 80% of them have never defaulted on a loan. This disparity is a direct result of the limited information available to financial institutions to make better credit assessments.

“Upstart’s mission is to enable effortless credit based on true risk, and NXTsoft’s mission is to enable effortless connectivity between Fintech and financial institutions,” said David Brasfield, CEO of NXTsoft. “NXTsoft is excited to partner with Upstart to streamline and scale their ability to onboard new partners to their smarter, AI-based credit decisioning that facilitates a modern, all-digital lending experience.”"

However the high valuations are not because all those companies are going to grow exponentially, it's because during the last 2 market crashes (2008 and 2020) the FED has flooded the market with fake dollars. And our government has increased its spending or handing out of those fake dollars.   All the while interest rates have been rock bottom.   Yes the market is growing because there's no better place to grow our money.   A side thought I had,  with so much 401k and retirement money during that same time span,  it artificially inflates the market.   Basically it comes down to more dollars chasing the same limited resource (in this case stocks).

6/23/2021 9:18,stocks,"Putting in money at ATH is not risky in general. It depends how high it is and how much future earnings will be worth. Also on your time horizon.

If you only hold for a year, then it is really risky. If you hold for 50 years you will notice a drop but still make good money.

It is unlikely that the market as a whole will perform well over the next decade, a decline is likely or that inflation negates a majority of profits. Waiting for a crash could make sense if you know at which prices you will buy and even more if you have an alternative that will give you inflation protection.

In the end it also comes down to how long you would have to wait and how much of a drop it will be. If your time horizon is long enough, and the drop far enough (or your average buys during that time) it could make sense if a crash will happen in the next few years.

today i will be writing about alibaba stock ""BABA"" and exlplain my thesis regarding the underlying.

# intro:

Alibaba Group Holding Limited operates various segments including : core commerce, cloud, digital media, entertainment, payment services...

business which Alibaba group own: Taobao, TMALL, Freshipo, Lazada, Ali-express, Alibaba, ele,me, 1688, youku, alibaba-cloud, alimama, cainiao network, dingtalk, ant group, ali-pay

Alibaba group does business in almost every thing you can imagine, therfore you can compare them to every big tech you know, they stand with the big dogs.(AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT) but they get less attention at the moment.  i think the sentiment towards alibaba is bound to change, very soon.

**Why BABA ?, why now ?**

baba showed negative performance relative to the other tech stocks at the moment (market sentiment due to politics - alot of impact on the stock) . but baba strength can be seen in a few areas: revenue growth, solid financial position with reasonable debt and very reasonable and cheap valuation. the profit margins are lower when comparing to peers right now but baba business have much to grow and much to be expected to fix that issue.

Baba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before, but i think the next earning this year will reveal growth in EPS.

Now, lets start of with the basics and take a look on baba financial and valuation.

&#x200B;

# valuation:

[https://postimg.cc/5XqrBJKp](https://postimg.cc/5XqrBJKp)

so looking at valuations:

Mkrt value:  573B

p/e: \~25x

Fp/e: \~21x

p/s: \~5.2x

p/b: \~3.9x -> very attractive at this rate !

eps(ttm): 8.48

eps(ntm): \~12

next e/r : Aug 19

[https://postimg.cc/2b5gjtwG](https://postimg.cc/2b5gjtwG)

At BABA current stock price of $211, the market is expecting revenue to grow at 48.8% for the next 1 years. Over this period, BABA is also expected to generate an average Economic Earnings Margin of 13.8%

Baba have increased theirlong term debt looking at their financials but due to increase in future revenue i believe it is nothing to be bothered by. debt is not an real issue to baba.

\*\*very important note is that comparing baba to other big techs valuations at the moment proves that baba is dirty cheap and can be a good short/long term play . even is market goes sideways i dont see baba going any lower than right now. 200 price is pretty strong ressitence and still a good price.

revenue growth: 47.96%

eps growth : 14.42%

i will be including a look into baba Assets and Liabilities, which i believe is showing us a healthy company which keep growing and expanding and inceasing their cashflow, revenue and shareholders equity.

## Liabilities:

## Assets:

**Profitability:**

Profitability in baba business is quite larger comparing to peers.

# analyst reports:

most of the ANALysts recommend this stock. various price targets between 260\~350 price targets.

**and a few buying into: (including ark queen which i dont follow but nice to see)**

alot of big hedgies hold baba, you can check it out. (blackrock, goldman etc)

# Technicals:

52wk High: 319.32

52wk Low: 204.39

Avg volume (3M) : 15.8M -> breakout will increase volume obiously everybody watching the stock movement right now.

baba is down \~33% from the top at 319.32 (10/27/21).

I expect to see a bullish breakout in a couple days, can be happening anytime right now. good support at 209-210 level, every time we get there i can spot large money flowing into baba.

I believe that a price of 300$ before the year ends is possible and quite easy with a very little catalyst or sentiment change towards the company. right now from what im reviewing the sentiment towards baba is starting to chagne across the internet and financial market.

All the Chinese government cares about is staying firmly in total power - capitalist markets be damned. Since Xi assumed power, the Chinese marketplace has become severely more regulated. Alibaba looks like a good value, but I'd wait until the Chinese government does something tangible to show they still value capitalist markets. Wait and see is the best approach to BABA."

6/23/2021 19:28,stocks,"Indeed, I'd never risk a major position in China se stocks but a minor one seems like a decent bet. I use 10% of my money on investing in high risk things such as Chinese stocks or random reddit yolos/meme stocks. If they moon I'll profit, if not the losses won't be major."
6/23/2021 12:35,stocks,"Tencent is the largest company in China by market cap.

Sinopec largest by revenue."
6/23/2021 13:55,stocks,"without the threat of breakdown by ccp, baba wouldn’t be so cheap for sure."
6/23/2021 16:12,stocks,"Not concern with chinese regulatory risks as im assuming china isnt stupid and rational.  Ant financial from what ive read seem predatory with the their loans and china has been trying to cut down on consumer debt.  China charging baba a % of their revenue seemed like it validated the accuracy of their financials.  

More concern with trade wars and delisting.  

I have a position cost basis $240.   Will buy more if it goes below 200 i guess."
6/23/2021 11:56,stocks,"Remember that the CCP does not want anything bigger than itself. That is always a looming threat to any ""giant"" in China."
6/23/2021 16:51,stocks,"Watched it as well. The main takeaway I got from his video was that even after making his own changes to their 5 year outlook and adding a 20% risk premium (regulation & Chinese company), BABA was still trading below his own fair value which is why he was buyer at the $210 level.

Basically it’s so discounted around these levels that it’s hard to ignore the value and ROI it could return from a risk/reward perspective"
6/23/2021 8:42,stocks,"well i wrote some of my reasons in this DD and my thesis is strong regarding baba, imo. in the video you just sent he just used DCF to value to company, which is fair but not a must, but i hope it will give other people a good idea about baba stock :)"
6/23/2021 12:06,stocks,"Agree, this is not entirely a bear case, but case in point for a good DD to point out this key factor that drives why BABA is where they are today"
6/23/2021 12:37,stocks,"Geopolitical risk is already reflected in the discounted stock price.

AAPL and TSLA have similar geopolitical risk. If China wanted to choose the nuclear option, they could shut off the entire electronics supply chain to those outside of China, starting with rare earth metals. (China produces around 65% of the world's silicon)

Face it, despite the constant saber rattling by the US against China, the US economy is hopelessly dependent on China for its electronics supply chain. You can't undo 30 years of outsourcing in a couple years.

The US currently is completely devoid of manufacturing know-how."
6/23/2021 9:47,stocks,"Seriously, people do not like how China can utterly destroy a company by terrorizing one of the executives."
6/23/2021 12:56,stocks,"Exactly this. Only a fool would invest in Chinese stocks with zero transparency, zero accountability and the CCP’s knack for government interference, I wouldn’t touch any Chinese stocks with a 10 foot pole."
6/23/2021 14:42,stocks,JACK MA IS NOT THE CEO OF BABA AND HAS NOT BEEN FOR YEARS. This damn sub needs this quote as a sticky for the next fucking decade.
6/23/2021 10:30,stocks,"short it/ buy puts, lets compare trades when ever you wish to."
6/23/2021 15:32,stocks,It is already represented at the stock price. Time will do its thing.
6/23/2021 10:08,stocks,buy puts buddy
6/23/2021 19:46,stocks,"Then short the stock, I dare you."
6/23/2021 9:10,stocks,So make a DD about it. Make sure to add plenty of rocket and ape emojis to show us you know what you're talking about.
6/23/2021 10:34,stocks,Sir this is a wendys
6/23/2021 16:11,stocks,Tilray is a terrible company hahahaha. The best thing you can do is cut losses with them and move on. You heard about opportunity cost right?
6/23/2021 8:52,stocks,"I don't see how listening for 8 minutes to get another perspective is going to do you any harm but sure. 

It was more for other people reading the thread so they have another source to support your DD, so they can decide if they want to invest or not. Reddit is currently infested with pump DDs which have nothing but positive cases and no bear case, trying to get everyone to buy some junk so they can sell their bags or profit off people. Not saying yours is, but there's a lot of it around right now. 

I do have a position in BABA at $211 and do intend to buy more though, I think you're right that it has room to grow again, but slightly less optimistic on price estimates."
6/23/2021 13:00,stocks,"dont tell them, they dont wanna know."
6/23/2021 12:42,stocks,"China could utterly destroy Tesla and Apple as well at the flip of a switch. 

Notice how Tim Apple and Elon are completely scared to death to say anything mean about China?"
6/23/2021 10:10,stocks,Upvoted! I hate china.. only invest in USA stocks FTW! Make the DOW great again 😁😁
6/23/2021 13:32,stocks,"You must hate money then.

Face it, every single Institutional investor, Blackrock, State St, Vanguard, Fidelity is heavily invested in China.

Every single hedge fund worth its salt is heavily invested in China.

Investors have a fiduciary duty to reduce geopolitical risk, and that risk includes spectacularly losing over the next couple decades to a surging China."
6/23/2021 19:43,stocks,Then you are in the wrong thread.
6/23/2021 16:41,stocks,"I know right?

Which makes it even more scary how BABA's stock fell from $300 on October has hasn't recovered since. Even though Jack Ma isn't as involved in BABA as a company anymore.

If Bill Gates or Larry Page was arrested in the U.S., I would expect Microsoft or Google shares to take a dip, but I wouldnt expect them to keep falling 20% and stay there for about eight months. The company should be more than its ex-CEOs/Founders."
6/23/2021 11:53,stocks,"lol, bringing up a bear case does not mean the stock should be shorted. It just seems disingenuous of your analysis to completely ignore the elephant in the room."
6/23/2021 14:09,stocks,DD doesn’t mean you just state one side of the coin. That’s all I’m pointing out here. You say it’s undervalued. There’s a reason for that and you ignore it here.
6/23/2021 10:35,stocks,"I like how you handle the negativity sir. I’ve been looking to get into BABA for a few weeks now, just gotta find money to put in"
6/23/2021 8:54,stocks,"i thought you wrote something else actually, edited my comment and watched it lol. you can read my comment now again."
6/23/2021 12:44,stocks,A bit different from 'kidnapping' one of the execs.
6/23/2021 12:58,stocks,"Which is why Apple is starting to shift to India.

But let’s get real- China won’t be able to disappear Musk or shut down any future IPOs Cook has planned.

The CCP’s interference should make every investor terrified to invest in Chinese stocks."
6/23/2021 14:21,stocks,"are you serious ? its not that im ignoring it, its not that im not aware of the elephant in the room. i am aware, i know the price stock at this moment represnts everything. from the US china relations to the ant not ipo and cut in value to jack ma and everything after.

if you would have read the actually DD you could understand my point, those old ""reasons"" that im aware of are not relvant anymore IMO, the company makes alot of money, they stand off with every over tech giant in the US. the valuation is very very cheap and therfore i anticipate with regarding to MANY reasons that the stock is due to bullish breakout, including the technical reasons with the fundamentals with change of sentiment towards baba and china.

but its ok, i only shared my information to open some eyes and let people be aware of great opportunity to make money."
6/23/2021 10:41,stocks,"if i wasnt certain about my thesis i wouldnt have posted this ""DD"". this post wont make me money. its not a meme low float high short kinda stock. my only intention was to spread the knowledge regarding a good trade. but blind people cannot be helped, and thats fine ."
6/23/2021 13:26,stocks,"The US would be a better place if it clamped down on fraud, corruption and grift like the Chinese government does.

China executes more people for fraud and corruption than any other country.

In the US, you have criminals like Bernie Madoff and Jeff Skilling operating scams for more than a decade, and hedge funds inside trading stocks like it's afternoon tea."
6/23/2021 13:10,stocks,"Shifting assembly to India won't do shit when your entire supply chain is disrupted.

You can't do anything if you can't even get silicon or batteries.

The US is just as likely to shit the fan as China is. That's why if you're smart you hedge your bets and invest in both. And then when the US finally gets its act together and decides that working together is the best approach going forward, as it has been over the past 20 years, you're in a win-win situation.

The past 20 years has been hugely deflationary for consumers, which is good because prices on technologies remains low, and the deflationary environment allows for a lower benchmark interest rate without fear of inflation. This in part, has occurred because of our cooperation with China.

Bringing back or on-shoring key technologies will be an expensive as hell endeavor, so if we decide to continue this ""cold war' with China and go at it ourselves, expect massive inflation to occur, and a whole class of people without the right skills in manufacturing or hardware supply chain to remain unemployed and unable to afford the rising cost of goods."
6/23/2021 10:45,stocks,Well thanks for taking the time out of your day 👍🏼
6/23/2021 16:14,stocks,"Sir don’t call us blind. Financially speaking, yes they must be in a great position but this is China we’re talking about. That’s where the risk comes in for me personally. I don’t think the risk is worth investing in this company. The CCP obviously had a problem with Jack Ma’s success and being so outspoken. The fact that he disappeared isn’t concerning to you?! I hope you make money as in everyone on this sub but calling people blind for not seeing your side of this is a bit immature."
6/23/2021 13:59,stocks,Wow. What the fuck.
6/23/2021 16:25,stocks,"got any reason for people hanging to those old reasons which upon they state their ""bear"" cases ? idc about jack ma, the ccp will be fine. what do you think china will do ? ban all relations with the us ? the us need china and china need the us. things gonna sort out either way. both countries will only thrive financialy when working together. and they know it."
6/23/2021 14:04,stocks,Found Jeff Skilling's alt
6/23/2021 15:07,stocks,That is what I said.
6/23/2021 16:31,stocks,"I agree with you on that statement, I think the bigger concern is that BABA’s growth now has a limit and they’re ability to keep up with competition or have a market cap like an AMZN is now being thrown out the window due to the CCP and how they control their businesses. In the USA we don’t seem to have that issue yet. The monopolies continue to grow in size and power. I’m not disregarding your DD, just think that the CCP is a big reason the bears exist for this particular stock."
6/23/2021 14:15,stocks,[removed]
6/23/2021 16:34,stocks,"yeah i understand your points. but i strongly believe that baba will keep growing bigger, they are much larger business than people understand. they are alot more than a monopol and thats why the ccp keep an eye on them. yet imo baba will stay on course, and the stock will shoot higher as the sentiment towards baba and china become better."
6/23/2021 16:41,stocks,I hope you are right and make a bunch of money off of your research! I put them on my watchlist and appreciate your DD and info posted. I always like to learn about new stocks and get exposure to info like this 👍🏽I can’t speak for all bears but hopefully my input was somewhat helpful to why this stock is potentially undervalued.
6/23/2021 0:00,stocks,"Array (ARRY) settlement? Owned ARRY back in 2016-17, sold it, forgot about it. Got a letter in the mail the other day saying some settlement had been agreed upon and I was entitled to some small sum of money based on my having owned it during that time. 

If it was the usual ambulance chasing I wouldn't think twice about it, but apparently this is a real settlement already agreed upon and all one as to do is sign up and get a check. Surprising all around because I was buying a lot of overhyped biotechs during that time and this one was one of the few on which I actually made money lol. But apparently something went ""arry"" and lawyers were called in.

Anyways, just wondering if anyone else received this notice, if it's worth it to pursue, etc."

Get it? *Busting* out.

No mainstream apparel brand is as on-point right now with Gen Z/Alpha vibes as American Eagle/Aerie.

Website/e-commerce site review:

The Gap/Old Navy e-commerce sites are incomprehensible and a mess. GAP looks like its using mid 00's style model pictures. Old Navy looks like a dollar store.

A&F doesn't let you browse their website with a VPN which a fail already. Secondly, they use the old style modeling pics that looks late 00s, early 10s. They're really leaning into the super-curvy model types, which is great for virtue signaling and ESG/social style investing, but from a subconscious marketing perspective, really gets away from what is ""aspirational"". Beware of this. I worked for a hedge fund in the mid 2010's that made a fortune shorting Michael Kors and Coach, because these brands too, lost their ""aspirational vibes"".

Victoria's Secret has pivoted away from SUPER SEXY into EVERYDAY COMFORT, but most of their marketing still pushes the bedroom rather than the beach vibe of Aerie.

I'm still on board with the thesis that **Aerie will overtake Victoria's Secret in market share in the women's underwear market in 5-7 years, assuming a growth rate between 12-80% per year, year over year decay, and increase in Victoria growth rate of 0-10%**"

They will subsequently outperform as credit spreads tighten when the economy bottoms out and recovery starts. Investment grade corporate bond returns, on the other hand, are more sensitive to interest rates than credit, so as interest rates fall during a recession, they will outperform vs equity, but will underperform vs government bonds which have the highest interest rate sensitivity. So to answer your question, investment grade corporate bonds are an OK recession hedge, high yield corporate bonds are not a recession hedge, and government bonds are the best recession hedge (especially long duration government bonds)."

6/23/2021 11:11,stocks,"So I'm definitely biased because I love Peloton as a user, and just became a (albeit tiny) investor. I think there is a ton of potential- their corporate wellness program can help them reach big companies that will buy pelotons for their gyms (at discounted rates and memberships for user), I agree with the other poster who said gyms themselves may start buying Pelotons. I know hotels and Air BnBs have already started doing this as travelers want to be able to have access to their Peloton stuff while away. Peloton has also gamified working out with badges, challenges, etc. as ways to keep people motivated. Not to mention- they have a HUGE variety of classes, and so much growth potential to other venues (boxing, rowing, and a mirror type thing have been rumored), as well as expansion into more countries. Obviously there have been missteps- but the potential is there. There are also rumors about expanding into their own wearables, as it's a pain right now to get Fitbit/Apple watches/ or other heartrate monitors to sync to their devices. They recently upgraded their heart rate monitoring aspect (Strive Score) and I think this COULD also allude to a branch out into wearables (although that's prob more of a conspiracy theory at this point, lol).

Personally, I think that the at-home gym is going to pick up, not slow down, post-COVID as people have realized and appreciate the convenience and affordability of it. This is totally all just my opinion, but as a Peloton user I can 100% see the potential.

Though I'd advise that you ask yourself whether the money you're thinking about investing is an amount that you mind losing if the stock suddenly dips. If it is, I'd not bet on GS. 

If you're looking to turn a quick profit, probably not a good idea to bet on GS (or almost any stock). 

If you're making the decision to buy based on hivemindspeak and not from information about the company you've read on your own, probably not a good idea.

If you, a novice, have a couple hundred, better to invest in something that is more stable, like an ETF for example. There's plenty of information here to get you started. It's not as thrilling as some of the stocks you may have heard about, but having stability supports your portfolio's balance so that if you do invest in something that's a fad, it won't hurt you as much if it dips.

Even on the bike there are many different instructors with different personalities and classes are also different. You can do 15min HIIT or 90min Power zone.   I pick my rides based on my mood.  They also do artist features so you can do a Lizzo ride or Beatles ride, for example. I would actually get more bored at the gym. 

And in terms of community/social aspect - there are very vibrant and active communities on Instagram and Facebook. I actually have Facebook friends now whom I met on some of those pages. And we plan rides together and share which strength classes we liked. I have never connected this much to anyone at the gym before. 

It really is a lifestyle change and I find it beneficial from any aspect: financial, variety, community, and most importantly - saving time.

Let's just say you made some decent money on meme stocks but wanted to take your gains and buy a decent amount of something that pays out some money to reinvest/spend/save what ever. What are some ideas or is this even a good idea? Noob obviously.
6/23/2021 6:07,stocks,Buy dividend paying stocks
6/23/2021 8:29,stocks,"There's a few types of dividend investing, I'll focus on 2 that might be good for you:

Dividend growth investing:

This strategy ignores higher yield for a higher rate of growth. Companies that have double digit dividend growth plus a strong company/moat like LMT are ideal on these cases. This is a long term strategy where your initial investment grows its output. For investors with a longer time horizon it's a good idea.

Income investing:

This strategy chases a higher yield in exchange for less growth. Covered call ETFs and high yield stocks are normally the target here, though the same aim of getting into a strong company or smartly managed fund applies here. This is a shorter term strategy that lets you live off your dividends now, so it's better for those with a shorter time horizon.

I personally just have some of each, though I'm more focused on growth than income."
6/23/2021 5:22,stocks,"I’d suggest just sticking a large chunk in S&P 500 index funds. Offers steady growth and a small yield paid quarterly

6/23/2021 1:41,stocks,"I know this is going to be an anticlimactic answer, but if I did really well in a meme stock ($CLOV), I would go to something that I would consider boring, such as BRK.B to keep my financial future rolling! Pass those puppies to loved ones upon my death in the form of a trust, and revel in the legacy I have built for myself. Best wishes!

Edit: If you're young, this is what I would *personally* do. This is my own stance and would suggest you do whatever best meets your goals and needs."
6/23/2021 1:41,stocks,"DGRO or VONV

Both broad based index funds focusing on value companies. I’m partial to DGRO as it’s focusing on companies that are growing their dividend but VONV will get you a higher current yield even if the growth isn’t as good."
6/23/2021 7:27,stocks,Pick a few strong companies that pay dividends.  Simple as that really. Considering the enevitable inflation and increase in interest rates. Banks and insurers could be a smart place to park your winnings.
6/23/2021 11:54,stocks,"Obviously, buy dividend paying stocks. But they're not all created equal. IMHO:

- your safest bet is a dividend fund or ETF like SCHD or HDV. these are higher-paying dividend stocks, from larger established blue-chip companies. you can get a 3-4% dividend. these stocks won't shoot up like meme stocks, but they will have modest capital appreciation over time. SCHD: https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/insights/resource/schd-fact-sheet or HDV: https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/hdv-ishares-core-high-dividend-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf

- next safest bet is single stocks from these types of American companies. look up ""dividend aristocrats"", companies that have never lowered or missed a dividend for decades or even centuries. the sweet spot seems to be stocks with high *yield* but low *payout ratio*. this means the dividend is larger relative to share price, but they pay out a lower percentage of profits, because they still devote a lot of money to expansion or research/development. aristocrats: https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/dividend-stocks-aristocrats high yield/low dividend, see page 13: http://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/high-dividends-research-by-tweedy-browne.pdf

- US REITs are also pretty safe (but not foolproof, as the Covid lockdown proved). these are real estate investment trusts, rental properties of some type or another that pay out a lot of their income to investors. VQN pays about 2%. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VNQ

- next safest best is dividend stocks/ETFs from larger foreign blue chip companies in developed markets. IDV is an example for an ETF. Japan, Western Europe and UK commonwealth nations are relatively stable and will often pay a bit more than US stocks. Rio Tinto mining pays 4-5% https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIO and Legal & General, a large old UK insurance company, pays 5-6% dividend. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LGGNY?p=LGGNY&.tsrc=fin-srch

- next best is something like DIV, which is very high yield US stocks in the 5% range. these are from smaller companies, or distressed companies that have raised their dividend to attract investors. this pays higher dividend than SCHD, but the companies are often lower quality and the share price is more likely to flatline for years. https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/div/

- last option is emerging markets dividends. this is the highest dividends but also highest risk, due to currency fluctuations and political risks. look at something like SDIV or DYYE. for an example, Sperbank from Russia pays a very high dividend, presently 5/6% but historically up to 8-10%. the risk is it's a Russian state-owned enterprise. ditto for China or Turkey.

Liners for short term capitalization on shipping rate increases. I am long $ZIM. They should earn over $20 a share, $2 special dividend coming soon, (I think Aug but would have to check) then they plan on return 30-50% of 2021 earning back to holders at beginning of 2022.

Ship lease companies, $ATCO, $DAC, $NMM.

ATCO, they specialize in longterm leases with numerous of the largest size. In order to see large returns they need the lease rate to stay high because of their long contracts plus size of company. They are considered like a blue chip of their industry.

$DAC they are printing cash, ok dividend could be better but last earnings call they said don't expect much of a hike. They are paying down debt, and saving for???? Not sure, they made waves when they said building war chest. But they are signing 3 and 4 year contracts, based on current contracts they could finish out contract scrap ships, close shop and you would have enough value for mid 70's in cash. 

$NMM - Hybrid containership leasor, drybulk. If they keep signing containership lease agreements like they have been, 3-4 year making tons of cash, you will be getting the drybulk portion for free. Which drybulk rates are right near 10 year highs. Big risk factor here is the Corp governance. The ceo owns a bunch of sister companies and has made some great moves but some that make you scratch your head. Current 1 being, she is issuing new units (partnership, so do your DD) at about half last reported NAV.

I am long all above stocks. Do your DD, and it takes time to figure out different sectors in Shipping. Not all are tankers!!!"
6/22/2021 23:59,stocks,"Streaming. SVOD/AVOD services are still a minority in the TV market and has massive room to grow. Most ad budgets are still overwhelmingly assigned to traditional TV as well. All of it is projected to flip-flop over the next decade and we will reach a point where nearly everything will be streamed. 

The trend towards remote and stay-at-home work is here to stay and streaming demand will remain elevated along with 5g, satellite and broadband expanding the potential market.

Stocks like Roku, TTD, DIS, VIAC all stand to benefit immensely. I see Roku with the most potential as they begin to monetize their subscribers and expand internationally. VIAC is incredibly undervalued with their biggest risk - debt - being inflated/QE'ed away. I see them as a longer term play with a lot of value coming 2022 and beyond. In the worst case, they become an attractive acquisition target."

RDS.A: theyre still priced as an oil and gas stock but I think they're the most likely to shift successfully into renewables. BP is a somewhat distant second in this category

CVX: i think Chevron is the best positioned major to continue to pump out dividends. Well run. 

I don't believe in any of the refiners. Most of the best refineries are owned by majors, and the ones that aren't are gonna have huge drag on them by the other portfolio refineries of the refining company.

Midstream: Kinder Morgan is still the go to here. 

For the long term, I'm not bullish on any of the smaller players. Too much risk: management risk, commodity price risk, no economies of scale, political risk. With the way governments and companies are shifting towards EVs, when oil demand peaks and starts to decline, smaller E&Ps will be the ones who die quickly."

Anytime there is a tech name I hear about and I get interested in, I discover it is already in BFOCX and go back to not caring. I am bullish on the industry itself and advise diversifying to the point where no name matters more than any other.

For Entertainment, Disney. Granted, I am in at $90/share, but still, would not be surprised to see Disney hit 5x its current valuation within a few years and end up with a ten-bagger.

Infrastructure, CLF. I really like it when a stock is in the Warren Buffet ""Yes"" pile. This is not too hard. Steel is needed. Steel is in short supply. This company is positioned to provide it advantageously.

The degree leverage is much lower and their assets are far less risky, plus they have passed all of the FEDs stress tests, and now with rates at rock bottom across the globe to me it seems like a great time to buy banks both ,  US and global my favorite are Citi and HSBC because they both have a large global presence particularly in Asia and I also like Goldman and Morgan Stanley on the investment banking side because those two definitelyhave the most stellar risk management in the business, in 08 both firms managed to remain the two last US independentinvestment banks and more recently made it out of the Archegos debacle with minor to no losses. As for private equity they have preformed great this past decade, however as rates rise the private equity firms main LBO strategy will suffer and they will have to change their strategy and hedge intrest rate risk, in this sector Blackstone is clearly the best bet mainly because they invested the most in the cheap period from 2009 to 2014 and this sets them up for the best future returns but they also are still lead by the founder and have the best reputation on the street, however KKR and Apollo as well as Carlyle are also great firms which undoubtedly will do well."

The 1.6GHz spectrum licence Ligado has have been speculative for a while but now that they have permission from FCC and 3GPP they are in a great spot to roll out ultra-reliable 5G solutions in the low mid-range freq.

Other 5G network providers did not go for the lower frequency licences because they didn't think it would be allowed yet, probably, with a lot of companies making a statement against Ligado's proposed use of the L-band and it's implications for GPS interference, but it's only a matter of time when they'll want to offer private networks with L-band capabilities because the propagation characteristics between the more widely used C-band and L-band are quite huge. The networks will be useful to support the C-band in both long-distance settings and urban settings with building penetration needs.

Honestly, with the money being thrown at Ligado to make the L-band 5G happen, I think Nokia will benefit from this partnership a lot."

I'm also bullish on online fast fashion companies Shein and ASOS. Mainly because I see them as takeover or partnership targets by Amazon or Alibaba.

The two companies have completely undercut the pricing of fast fashion competitors H&M, F21, Mango and to a certain extent Zara. And when your market is disposable fashion, price really really matters. They've done this through superior online execution and JIT C2M manufacturing that's even faster than Zara, the previous gold-standard bearer in speed."

6/23/2021 11:13,stocks,Also UMC. Recently signed a deal with QCOM and is a solid second sourcing play with demand currently through the roof.

6/23/2021 15:50,stocks,What about $MOSY?
6/23/2021 2:24,stocks,How do they accurately diagnose issues via teleconference? Curious how accurate that is vs in person. I just used a telehealth app and was misdiagnosed for strep. Suffered for 10 days before I said F it I’m going to a office and they had a test done in 5 mins and meds prescribed.
6/23/2021 4:24,stocks,"I work in pharma too and there are some things about Regeneron that I just cannot get past. 

1) Some of their executives get paid an *insane* amount. Granted they typically are an R&D focused company, but their head of R&D's pay package was just short of $135 millon for 2020 alone! CEO received something similar if not a bit more.

2) By far far far their best seller is Eylea, and its patent protection is running out soon, and you best believe there are other companies waiting in the wings. Regeneron got a bit fortunate in the last year or so that a similar product newly launched by Novartis hit a speed bump a few months after launch.

Will certainly be interesting to see how Regeneron progress in the next few years!"

6/23/2021 4:40,stocks,"Counter point: most of the civilized world doesn't trust the nuclear power industry because they're as dishonest as Big Tobacco.  The large pile of accidents has made people realize nuclear can't honestly be called ""safe"" and the fact they've still haven't solve the toxic waste problem, so they're lying when they say ""clean"" too.  There's moratoriums on new nuclear sites and they're accelerating the decommission of old ones.

Most significantly is that while nuclear has does nothing for the last 20 years (except destroy a quadrant of Japan and leak poison into the world's oceans) renewable energy has made incredible advancements.  Sun and wind and water and thermal energy are finally viable, and getting better every day. People have realized that nuclear (with its legacy of broken promises and lies) is no longer the only alternative.  It's now the least desirable of the non-carbon sources.

Reddit is heavily laced with nuclear industry astroturfers, so you can expect them to post the same tired and misleading talking points here.  They're boosted by kids who just took junior high school physics and think they just discovered the atom, so then eagerly repeat and embellish as much fishing line as the astroturfers give them.  If they put half the effort into safety and humility as they do into propaganda, they might not be in such bad shape."

6/23/2021 4:42,stocks,"You may indeed be right.  But consider the example of our neighbors in Canada.  Since they legalized, it has been an epic flop.  And their culture is far more open and tolerant of the devil's lettuce than we are."
6/23/2021 8:46,stocks,"The global weed industry projection is <$50b. Do the math on how much these weed companies should be worth. Check their graphs, besides pumping and dumping, weed stocks kill portfolios. I think weed will be a very hard investment because, contrary to what people believe, weed is going to be less valuable and MORE competitive when it's legalized fully in the US. That means less money for companies. 

If you wanna ride it out for the next pump and dump, that's not a bad thesis. But to say weed is a $100b industry is flat out wrong. At one point aphria and tilray (Canadian companies) were valued as much if not more than the entire current weed industry. Their valuations are still a bit ahead.

I expect the big winners in the weed space to be constellation brands and altria, since they are large cap stocks that own positions in canopy and cronos respectively. They have the cash and ability to buy out these smaller companies and compete on a large scale. Tilray is okay, but they have no american exposure, I believe. And the entire Canadian marijuana industry is valued at $4b. I believe the numbers I cited are relavent for 2019, so maybe a bit outdated, but relatively accurate."
6/23/2021 7:25,stocks,I'm bullish on Trulieve $TCNNF and $MSOS etf.

I wasn’t impressed with Rocket Mortgage when I tried it years ago as they made it seem like I would only be approved for way, way less than what I actually would end up being qualified for. I swear they just multiplied what I had as down payment and multiplied it by 5 and called it a day lol."
6/23/2021 4:26,stocks,"They're a $20 billion company earning $4+ billion.  It wouldn't matter if they were selling buggy whips, those are insanely good numbers.  

They are number one in their market with credible plans to more than double their share by 2025.  Even in a heavy downturn, they have huge numbers.  And since you raised credit quality they have the lowest default rate and highest average credit score of any major origination company.  They's a stealth fintech, containing within their structure an equivalent of Docusign, an equivalent of Lemonade, and others.  Their tech clever a offloads the work to non-salaries outsides, leaving their own staff to focus on closings and getting all the details perfect for a closure time about twice as quick as industry.

6/23/2021 9:37,stocks,"Wow, sorry that happened to you! I looked into data for accuracy of diagnosis and much of it shows that numbers vary between platforms but I didn't come across numbers specifically for teledoc that were recent. More generally here's a study from an ER that implemented Telehealth: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30209006/

Essentially found no significant difference  in terms of accuracy between in-person vs Telehealth using cancelation of orders for diagnostic tests as the primary outcome. But this is just one study in one hospital. Certain diseases are much harder to diagnose via Telehealth but the industry is still in its infancy. Short term the opportunity in chronic care management is what excites me. Longer term new innovations will likely need to occur for it to become mainstream"
6/23/2021 9:52,stocks,Great points! The executive compensation was concerning to me as well. And in regards to Eyelea there are many pharma companies I have come across with the same risk. I mentioned one in $ABBV with their expiring Humira patent. Essentially I view $REGN as underpriced for the short term (1 - 3 years) but would not plan to hold past that barring changes in product sales. I'm more short term bullish due to their REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. The FDA recently approved a lower dose and I see significant opportunity in emerging markets. I don't believe growth in this segment has been priced in by the market

6/23/2021 4:19,stocks,"Against it. The old saying is ""where the data lives the compute follows"", but: the only reason why snow has a niche is because aws does something very unamazonian: they kept the price for S3 and all storage stuff artificially high, prioritising margin over defeating the competition.

This means, if there was a significant move from aws to snow, amzn could change the pricing and offer people discounted transfers back. This is a purely artificial niche.

And the different sectors within the industry. 1 thing I have learned is you need a strong stomach. 5% moves in either direction happen a lot. So I have taken the approach of make sure I like the fundamentals of the company and sector. Makes the down days much easier.
6/23/2021 9:33,stocks,"I have liked TRTN for years, they have a great management team, return a nice dividend. I however sold out when they were around 60. I felt like the ship lessors and dry bulk were a better play. I am a little concerned that the container lessors will over build containers thus crushing lease rates in near future. But a similar company was just bought buy liner at a nice premium, so that means the box shortage might last for awhile. I will definitely keep an eye on TRTN because I like the company.  But with all of these shipping names, I move in and out more then I do for long buy and hold names. They are sticks you have to keep an eye on because economics for them change fast."
6/23/2021 7:56,stocks,"Same industry. Agree with much of what this guy said, but less bullish on Viacom until I see how some of the other consolidation shakes out. 

I like Vizio for many of the same reasons as Roku and MGNI, TRMR for programmatic. The latter is purely due to valuation though, not because they’re executing or especially well positioned. Just cheap compared to other industry multiples."

You adress a valid point but I don't see the amount of containers overtake demand soon, since demand is still expected to rise over the next couple of years. 
The main problem I can see is the pollution of containerships. A lot of containerships are relatively old and really bad for the environment. If companies don't commit to reduce pollution other shipping methods might take over."

How to value market-leading tech stocks is as much an art as a science. Look up Beth Kindig. She's been one of the few people mostly right on tech stocks for a while.

NET, CRWD, FVRR, LMND, OLO, GLBE, PATH, STEM, UPST. These are just some of the stocks with high price to sales multiples that come to mind. 

https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=ind_softwareinfrastructure&o=-ps

I own LMND, PATH, STEM, and used to own CRWD and NET. These command high valuations not so much because of hype but because they have actually been growing like mad, both revenues and into new and yet to even emerge sectors. And sure, hype, too. I sold CRWD and NET in April/May thinking they'd be the first to collapse in the event of a market meltdown, but they're tech leaders that are leading the way back in growth stocks.

Still, are they ""fairly valued""? I don't know. I own a lot of value growth stocks, too, that I really like by PE and conventional measures: ONEW, THO, CCS, INMD, PUBM, PERI. Check out the IBD 50. Also just plain old value stocks like JOAN.

rather, i sell crap in a market downturn for loss, and add to my winners into weakness. 

i will just say that with growth stocks, quality of leadership is critical. one major reason i got into net and crwd is due to the caliber of the respective founders. insanely talented, ambitious, and visionary leadership.

I do question their valuation right now but by the same token, I've seen a few estimates of them hitting $295 by end of the year.  There is a lot of enthusiasm around CRWD and cybersecurity is a hot space with everything that's happening in US right now.

The fact that you’re making the kinds of returns you are without knowing the difference between revenue and earnings is a testament to the fact that people can be successful with a lack of knowledge. Success + knowledge leads to hubris which leads to blowing up your first account. Maybe you never experience a significant loss but, imo, if you haven’t taken it on the chin a few times and clawed your way back, you can’t call yourself a successful trader.

Also, you’ve got multiple posts in your history about selling out of tech and moving to value… 🤔"

Also want to mention that all my stocks are for long term so not selling anything for at least five years and possibly longer. Which one would you pick and why? Thank you.
6/22/2021 20:21,stocks,"Between the two, I would pick Starbucks. I think coffee and the coffeehouse experience has more of a shelf life than fast food. Over time I think it will take more work for McDonald’s to maintain its market share and grow in new markets. And the costs of doing so will be significant. Starbucks I think has an easier and more globally appealing roll out model"
6/23/2021 2:52,stocks,"I personally don’t like either one but I’d go McD’s if only because they have a buttload of cash + global brand recognition. It seems like you’re looking for a safe long term pick based off your post. Personally, I’d pick KO. The Coca Cola Company owns over 200 different brands, and their products are sold in over 200 countries/territories and has a 3% dividend. There’s not a lot of growth since it’s a mature company, and due to the pandemic (restaurants being shut down) there’s been a decline in sales which has affected its financial statements in a negative way, but I don’t see the demand for their products to ever going away. There’s also MCO, Moody’s Corporation which is a credit rating company. Admittedly, idk much about it, but it has 40% market share in that area and Warren Buffet seems to believe in it enough to have held it for 20 years. Not only that, but it’s up over 200% in the last five years, and it grew 18% during the pandemic. This isn’t at all financial advice, just my opinions; definitely do your due diligence and good luck investing!"
6/22/2021 21:08,stocks,Personally I prefer McDonald’s. 26% profit margin vs Starbucks 4%. Plus I like their food and brand more.
6/22/2021 23:32,stocks,I like Starbucks. I also own Starbucks so I am being a shameless shill.
6/22/2021 20:31,stocks,"If we're picking between the two, MCD is ultra defensive, with truckloads of cash, and an unparalleled ability to increase dividend. Buy today, and it may seem like the dividend at 3% is mediocre, but they've shown the ability to and dedication to consistently increase it. SBUX isn't a bad company, but if you're heavy in growth, you should want a super stable option, and there's very few options in any sector more stable than MCD."
6/22/2021 20:48,stocks,"I think this depends on your long term outlook for the economy and your current portfolio.  If you need more defensive diversity then MCD.  MCD is more recession proof.

Starbucks could very well have a higher return, but the point is risk adjusted return. SBUX could also return negative yields, or less positive. MCD will never ""moon,"" but it will steady churn out returns, especially over a 20 year outlook.

6/22/2021 20:28,stocks,"I’ve said this many times and I’ll say it again: I really like Microsoft.  They are heavily betting on cloud with Azure. They’ve had huge growth through it and have managed to take market share from AWS. Xbox is about to be more than just consoles, it’ll be more about the gamepass and other services. The Office 365 and Windows are super popular products for businesses and everybody uses them. Probably one of the strongest moats in the world. LinkedIn is also a very interesting one since it is a platform with so many possibilities. 

Financials are great. Everything is going up smoothly revenue and net income wise. Margins are also nice. The balance sheet is true grit with the well controlled debt and huge pile of cash. And Satya Nadella isn’t afraid to use it. He’s a great CEO and will lead the company beyond that 2 trillion dollar market cap. They’ve had their differences with the US government in the past, so I think Microsoft won’t face as much preassure from Capitol Hill as the other big tech companies."
6/22/2021 20:54,stocks,All I know is I've been told to never sell MSFT or AAPL.  20% of my portfolio and have been solid.
6/22/2021 21:23,stocks,"From 2001 to 2010 investors didn't think it was a 'good buy'. Hind sight - they we're wrong. 

As long as the market is strong MSFT stock price will be strong. When the market struggles MSFT will linger. The Covid crash of 2020 proved that. They have a AAA credit rating and revenues growing at supersonic speeds and a boatload of cash. As long as you don't panic sell during a weak market MSFT is a great place to invest."
6/22/2021 21:42,stocks,"Try not to think about the market cap number in isolation. In the past a billion, 10 billion and 100 billion dollar company was crazy. Now all are common place. Think more about earnings, earnings growth and PE multiples. In my lifetime a company will likely be worth 100 trillion"
6/23/2021 2:31,stocks,Been DCAing MSFT for the last four months!
6/22/2021 20:14,stocks,it should be part of the FAANG stocks imo.  Easy buy
6/23/2021 4:23,stocks,I like what they are doing with gamepass.

6/22/2021 20:43,stocks,"Is MSFT a great company? Absolutely

Is their stock a good buy today at it's valuation? That depends on your assumptions

Is google good at $100/share? How about $1M per share?

Valuation is important"
6/23/2021 7:40,stocks,"In 100 years, a market cap of 2 trillion will be considered mediocre for a company."

6/23/2021 2:19,stocks,Plus what’s their P/E like 11 well below other tech stocks
6/23/2021 3:58,stocks,Just curious why not AAPL?
6/23/2021 17:21,stocks,Grandmas stock 😴😴. Apple and Microsoft so dam boring. These stocks are for lazy people
6/22/2021 20:58,stocks,Maybe look for the next Microsoft?
6/23/2021 9:41,stocks,"What I don’t like about Microsoft is they are losing their grip over the server operating system space and that’s going to bleed over into workstation operating systems. Linux distorts are becoming more and more widely used. I feel like legacy software is the only thing keeping companies on Windows. 

They also don’t have the leverage in cloud space that they once had in desktop operating systems. Amazon is far more popular among IT professionals."
6/23/2021 10:49,stocks,"Great buy and future prospects, but it's trading at a lofty valuation is the only reason I don't pile on."
6/22/2021 20:18,stocks,Feel like MSFT might as well be my savings account at this point lol
6/23/2021 14:19,stocks,If the ceo changes reevaluate. They can break the company. Dont just assume 10 years from now it will be the same.
6/22/2021 21:11,stocks,Yup. MSFT and APPL are never sells.
6/23/2021 12:25,stocks,Well it wasn't really a good buy during that time. There was a period from around 2002-2012 where they were pretty much stuck at $27. They really started to take off when they got into cloud.
6/23/2021 6:51,stocks,"100 trillion is not realistic lol that's 5x the U.S. GDP, the money has to come from somewhere. 

But Apple will definitely hit 10 trillion in the next few decades."
6/22/2021 20:58,stocks,It is FANMAG.  It's always been part in my book.
6/23/2021 7:27,stocks,"Been seeing, and sorry this may cause some to gag 😄, MAGA (microsoft, apple, google, amazon)"
6/22/2021 21:28,stocks,If you believe the general sentiment that $300 is a target in the next year then I'd argue so. That'd put it on par with Apple's current valuation
6/22/2021 20:59,stocks,Will MSFT be cheaper in 5 years? No!
6/22/2021 21:25,stocks,I mean it has reached a historic high. My question is whether you keep going with it. I'm specifically framing it around the upward price
6/22/2021 23:11,stocks,"Towards the end of last year, there were posts complaining about how MSFT and AMZN had been stagnant for months and were no longer buys (compared to what was trendier at the time), and now it's the other way around it seems."
6/23/2021 9:31,stocks,I also own Apple. Moreso posing the question around MSFT due to the growth. Apple became kind of hit and miss as a recommendation once they got so big. Does not seem like Microsoft is in that situation
6/23/2021 7:29,stocks,OP didn’t say not Apple
6/23/2021 9:49,stocks,"Both are solid companies, but imo I honestly don't like the way Apple is cannibalizing their balance sheet overtime for stuff like share buybacks. When the assets to liabilities ratio shrinks on a balance sheet that's usually a bad sign. It's still a strong balance sheet for now, but it's not as strong as it once was.

MSFT on the other hand still has a solid balance sheet, and is one of only 2 companies with a higher credit rating than the US government."
6/22/2021 23:00,stocks,"Provided Microsoft, Google, Amazon or Apple doesn't buy them first."
6/23/2021 17:20,stocks,"Same here. I bought some for less than $30 a share about 10 years ago. Looking at the current prices, it’s tough to get myself to buy more."
6/22/2021 20:19,stocks,Agree. MSFT and FBGRX i just pile cash into it. See you in 30 years
6/23/2021 9:24,stocks,"Yeah, it's like practically impossible to find a safer company than MSFT. They're one of only two companies in the world with a higher credit rating than the US government. They have enough cash on their balance sheets today to pay out something like 10 years worth of dividends.

If you had to a pick company who's not yet a dividend aristocrat who looks like they could one day become a dividend king then Microsoft would be at the top of that list, which speaks volumes for how safe of a long term investment they are even if you don't care for the dividends."
6/23/2021 11:30,stocks,It literally is mine. Lol
6/23/2021 6:50,stocks,Apple
6/22/2021 20:56,stocks,Better than a savings account.  What savings account gives a 10 to 50% return yoy??
6/22/2021 21:15,stocks,Not yet anyways.
6/23/2021 12:32,stocks,"Correct once Ballmer resigned it was off to the races. But you always have to look at total return and with the dividend that comes out to a lot. And if you reinvested them which I and many others did, well lets just say it was a GREAT buy. Again hindsight and at the time no one knew MSFT would reinvent themselves and revenue go off the charts! Never discount total return."
6/23/2021 9:14,stocks,"5x ‘current’ GDP. 30 years ago US GDP was 2 trillion (apples current market cap now), 10 times smaller than current GDP. I said in my lifetime. Hopefully I have another 50-60 years to go. So we’ll see"
6/23/2021 9:27,stocks,"MSFT & AAPL are international companies though, they aren't 100% dependent on just the US for their money.

But yeah, it does seem highly unlikely that either will ever be 5x the US GDP of that day."
6/23/2021 1:28,stocks,N is NVDA
6/23/2021 0:34,stocks,"True, I am long MSFT but just think some people forget the basics of investing"
6/22/2021 22:32,stocks,Wrong. You mean that would be on par with Apples “market cap” not “valuation”. Big difference between the two. Apple is actually trading at a lower valuation than Microsoft rn.
6/23/2021 0:35,stocks,It's not the only investment opportunity.
6/23/2021 9:21,stocks,What about in 1 year
6/22/2021 23:46,stocks,Fspgx is a pretty similar fidelity etf with a much lower expense ratio.
6/22/2021 20:57,stocks,The world is ending in 5 years.

6/23/2021 9:28,stocks,"I mean seeing Apple hit 100 trillion is my dream, I’d 50x my investment. So I hope you’re right lol"
6/23/2021 1:54,stocks,There are many fundamental reasons for that. Apple is expected to have lower phone sales and it hasn’t grown quite as consistently as Microsoft has for the past few years. Also Microsoft’s moat is larger imo.
6/22/2021 22:53,stocks,Good point. I was off on that. I was reading his comment as market cap which is obviously what I was referencing
6/23/2021 1:37,stocks,You're right but it's solid.

6/23/2021 7:38,stocks,"I never once said the reason why Apple has a lower valuation than Microsoft. All I said is that market cap is different from valuation and Apple has a lower valuation than Microsoft. Was never trying to argue why in the first place but go off. Also your points on Apple are completely wrong. “Hasnt grown as consistently as Microsoft in the past few years.” Apple is currently up 460% in the last 5 years and Microsoft has grown 420% in the last 5 years so you are completely wrong on that point. Also you do realize that Apple has other products besides the Iphone right? They sell phones, computers, tablets, watches, headphones, and other subscription services. The iphone currently makes up the bulk of their revenue but they are growing their other products in the double digits every quarter. Plus they are working on medical devices and AR technology which has been confirmed."

6/23/2021 0:00,stocks,"Canadian Single-sports Betting Approved by the Senate Source: [https://www.thescore.com/nhl/news/2182004](https://www.thescore.com/nhl/news/2182004)

Single-game sports betting is set to become legal in Canada after Bill C-218, the Safe and Regulated Sports Betting Act, was [officially passed](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&billId=10866122) in the Senate of Canada on Tuesday.

The private member's bill - sponsored by Conservative MP Kevin Waugh (Saskatoon-Grasswood) - passed without amendment, by a vote of 57 to 20 (five abstentions). Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government will decide on a date when the legalization of single-game sports betting will take effect.

The bill signals a major shift in Canada: single-game sports betting has been legal in the country but only via parlay wagers. Canadians will now have the ability to bet on single-game matches across sports (excluding horse racing), with the government set to collect taxes on estimated billions of dollars currently being wagered illegally.

Waugh issued a [statement](https://kevinwaugh.ca/mp-waugh-statement-on-passage-of-single-sports-betting-bill-in-the-senate/) Tuesday evening celebrating the passage of the bill, calling it ""a victory for Canadian sport, sport fans, and businesses."" He added:

>Following this legislation becoming law, provincial governments will be responsible for implementing regulations and wagering operators in their jurisdictions. I call on provincial governments to act as quickly as possible to get the necessary regulations and licenses in place so that all Canadians can begin to place their wagers."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

$CAH  - Great horizontal triangle forming, we have some beautiful consolidation. We can buy low here and wait for a breakout pretty much risk free.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

$CERE - this is a clear descending triangle so use a stop loss, but we can see a 10$ - 15% move fairly quickly with this one. If we also start to uptrend we will have the bets value.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

$CO   - Great uptrend and we are falling into value. I obviously wouldn't catch a falling knife, but this is a perfect spot to see some possible life and support form.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

$EA   - A really nice ascending triangle here as we hope to pressure the $148 resistance once again. Maybe only 6% with no breakout, but very little risk buying in here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

$GIII - Newer channel up forming as we have consistent higher lows here. Once again we have an amazing value and we hope to see it keep this pattern going strong.

&#x200B;

$PAG  - Falling knife right into value, we have to hope it holds. Very obvious resistance trendline, if you're nervous wait to break that to keep it moving.

Used as a sort of LinkedIn for 80% of US doctors, so it seems like the healthcare community has greater trust in it than other Telehealth providers. Honestly looks like a great future potential buyout target by Teladoc. Would love to hear some more opinions though. That is why I am bringing this to the virtual water-cooler that is reddit.

What their revenue and earnings will look like post-pandemic will be of great interest to determine whether I continue to HODL or just cash out, but my personal thought is that, for all the shit the pandemic wrought, it ushered in the legitimacy of telehealth and that's not going away ever."

NY times is valued at $7B and has a digital audience much larger than just MDs.

6/23/2021 0:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, June 22, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 22, 2021**

The stock market rose again today, driven by a continued rally in tech stocks and tempered inflationary fears. The Nasdaq (QQQ) reached a fresh record high for the second time this week and the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover following its worst week since October 2020. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.54% higher and is two points away from its record high. With earnings for Q2 fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

Today, in a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, “We will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.” He went on to further say recent price increases “don’t speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates” but come from factors “directly affected by the reopening”. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a “broad set of labor market statistics” before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said “We will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures…. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared”. 

As expected, response by lawmakers to Powell’s testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. 

On Thursday, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.

Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the boar

* Twitter (TWTR) is moving forward with plans to increase monetization opportunities. The company said it is opening applications for users who want to test new features - Super Follows and Ticketed Space. ""Super Follows,"" which will let them sell exclusive content to paying subscribers, and ""Ticketed Spaces,"" to charge for entry into audio chat rooms they host on the platform.

The company has been around for over 20 years and never made a profit. They also have no major products unless you consider the fuel cells they sell for forklifts which they barely sell. The company has been caught faking their financials and have been sued by multiple investment firms because of it. They are also currently trading at a ridiculous valuation that no way affects their earnings or projected earnings. They dilute shares massively as well. They are basically a Nikola 2.0. Not saying this company cant stage a huge comeback and become the largest supplier of hydrogen fuel cells in the world and make billions but the chances of that happening are slim to none.

6/23/2021 1:10,stocks,"Tesla's battery day showed their future batteries which don't use cobalt, others will follow suit so that issue should be taken care of in the semi near future.  You do need lithium still, but that is not nearly as destructive to extract.

Hydrogen takes a lot of energy to produce, mostly from natural gas at the current moment and so isn't perfectly clean.  That is why I we need to see some technological improvements here to make production more effective."
6/22/2021 21:42,stocks,"Minerals can and will be recycled, in fact the mining will only be a problem while we get a baseline supply for batteries.



Comapre to hydroeen where green is possible but rare since most plants use natural gas in its production, which is a byproduct of gossile fuel extraction. Also a *major problem* with hydrogen is that it is *extremely volatile*, a simple car crash could kill more people then most modern car bombs.



In Sweden we had hydrogen busses on trial. One was in an accident and emergency drives had to *evacuate a full city block* due to the risk of destruction if the hydrogen was ignited. Cars crash every day, in big cities many times a day. If 0,001% explode its still enough to make the Hindenburg look like prank in comparison.

Game pass is a few good titles and lots of crap games, much like Netflix had cheap nature documentaries and shit to say ""thousand sof titles available"" (98% is crap you'll never want but...big number is good).



Same applies here, the *second* game pass proves even remotely profitable well see competition. We saw it happen to Netflix with competitors streaming, we saw it happen on PC with competing storefronts (Gog etc). MS without third party publishers/games simply isn't enough...



Sony on the other hand is surely late to the whole ""digital party"". That said they got *stellar first party games/studios"" and create new AAA IPs with success. Further more their consoles are selling like hotcakes, Ps4 was a stellar success depaite all and Ps5 is so far outselling it.

6/22/2021 23:42,stocks,"If FB beats their forward earnings (projected at 13.12) by say, 20% (up to 15.75) and at the same time has its p/e multiple  revaluated up to the S&P average of 32.1 (28.5 currently) it's then a $505 stock next year. Then if earnings grow another 20% the following year, it's a $600+ stock in 2 years.

Not saying that is likely, as FB's p/e will probably continue to be weighed down by regulatory worries, plus if the average S&P p/e is in the 30s in 2 years I'll be deeply surprised - but that is how it COULD happen."

Ontop of this people also buy square on the hopes of them becoming a big major financial player but also ignore fb tryna get into the space also using their moat and marketplace to their advantage. 

The list goes on yet people still ignore fb potential, i mean if theirs anyone who can potentially rival amazon in e-commerce it’d probably be fb with an existing user base and cash flow to burn. This isn’t even mentioning everything else they work on too.

Also might i add shopify and square are both trading at a premium compared to fb to boot."
6/23/2021 5:38,stocks,"I have maybe a dumb question.  Facebook owns WhatsApp and Instagram afaik and whilst I don’t use the Facebook app, I do use WhatsApp and lots of people do use Instagram.  Facebook probably owns other kinds of apps and technologies that I’m not aware of.  Are these not also factors into the share price?

I have no positions in Facebook myself, but I’m just curious because for me it has been clear for awhile (perhaps wrongly) that the Facebook platform is dead, but the company do have lots of other applications as well."

There's just too much to work with for an ongoing project like that, so random sampling is needed and will have some level of error. In the short run, this means there is a little uncertainty.

Microsoft hasn’t shown that they have the leadership on the content side to compete, they haven’t even been able to handle Halo properly in close to a decade, and between that and Forza that’s all they really have first party wise.

6/23/2021 10:16,stocks,"Your response question while fair, misses the point.  Reality itself and an understanding of how inflation rate is calculated and presented by the US Government both define how the numbers presented are a complete fallacy.  I suggest you go look at how the reported inflation rate is calculated, what is included in those metrics and most especially everything that is left out (purposefully, to present a lower than real number).  Then go look at the real world prices of the durable goods, real-property and other metrics over the last 10, 20,30 years.  You will realize the ""inflation rate"" is all smoke and mirrors very quickly.  You need to think about how the macro-economic cogs work in our country and how the populace is not supposed to understand how inflation is artificially driven to cover debt,  how debt drives the economy and how the cyclical nature of it all keeps us moving forward.  If the real numbers were presented to your average person, it would scare the daylights out of them when they realized that their dollars are meaningless and becoming more worthless every day and that the debt that hangs over their head is really what keeps them alive as it is a funding mechanism artificially driven out by making the debt itself less valuable."

Imagine buying a fridge but you can't open the door because you didn't subscribe or like a weights machine that locks until you sign the disclaimer."
6/23/2021 3:13,stocks,"How about a fridge that yells encouraging shit at you every time you choose a healthy food, fat shames you when it sees you eating McDonalds, and costs $39 a month to unlock the ""just a normal fridge"" feature."
6/23/2021 7:36,stocks,"Why the fuck do people pay several thousands for a machine only to then have to pay for a subscription that costs more than a gym membership?

6/23/2021 6:46,stocks,"In Australia, statutory warranty is not time limited as long as the major issue is more serious than reasonable wear and tear. Statutory warranty is for the life of the product.

A major issue is a problem with a product that would have prevented the consumer from purchasing the product had they know about it prior to the purchase.

I don't think it is unreasonable to say that treadmill no longer working is a major problem which would have prevented the consumer from purchasing had they known prior to the purchase.

And no, they're not gonna be able to argue that the treadmill is not broken because it works with a subscription. Products and services are strictly defined in Australian consumer law, and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) have already smacked Valve for saying Steam games are a service, so I'm not sure Peleton will be more successful."

6/22/2021 20:03,stocks,Why would you buy a peloton treadmill and not have a subscription? There are tons of other options for much cheaper if you just want a treadmill. Their biggest competitive advantage is having the best content of any home exercise provider.

I'd interested to hear people's thoughts on this though, am I missing something?"
6/23/2021 4:41,stocks,"That's a lot of BS.  They must be in the agenda that no one owns anything and they're happy about it.  So buy the product to have to pay a subscription?  Peleton eat a dick.

6/23/2021 9:27,stocks,"I know that this is r/stocks, but as someone who exercises pretty frequently, it disgusts me how much and how apparent the industry takes advantage of consumers. I understand like basic gym fee’s, but it’s a shame that we live in an age where we can put people on the moon, can travel the world in mere days, etc., etc., but we still don’t collectively support general fitness and health. 

A part of this is from the community, too. Too many people have come to expect and support these exact kind of money grabbing schemes under the pretense of health and fitness, or are just off putting/rude to people trying to get into shape. 

Sorry I know I’m just ranting somewhere that my rant doesn’t belong. It’s just really disappointing."

If I was subjected to a forced subscription after the fact--in order to keep using it--I'd due to return the machine and invoke my contacts, with similar machines, to assist in a massive outcry on social media. 

The problem with creating a group of users passionate about a shared device, is that they might just band together an flip on you."
6/23/2021 11:37,stocks,I was considering buying one. Guess I'm not now. Those subscriptions cost the entire unit after a couple years.

6/23/2021 17:00,stocks,"fake news. as others have pointed out, it will continue to work fine without a membership long term, and short term they are giving people free memberships so they can continue to use it in the interim. this means not only do they continue to be able to use it without a subscription, they get the perks of a subscription for a few months."
6/22/2021 20:25,stocks,"Still long PTON.

They do a billion a year in recurring revenue, and they will add to that number as more corporate subsidized ""wellness"" programs continue to subsidize Peloton subscriptions.

Their fitness content and trainers are unmatched.

The risk I see is if their best trainers start leaving Peloton for someone like Apple maybe? But thus far this hasn't happened....."
6/23/2021 0:41,stocks,"They are offering a full refund if this does not appeal to you.  If I understand, this was the only way that they felt that they could safely put some of the precautions/restrictions in place without having to do a full recall.  They openly state that they hope to have an alternate solution in place that will allow ""Just Run"" in the near future.  Considering you can't even buy the tread at this time, it is clear that they are putting safety first here.  I'm sure that they are not looking to have people return the tread simply over $39/month.  That assumes 9 years of a subscription.  Pretty lofty risk if that was the angle."
6/23/2021 11:32,stocks,What an asshole company.
6/22/2021 21:26,stocks,"Due to sunken cost fallacy mindset, a lot of owners may start paying this.  They may rationalize it like ""I paid so much for this thing, I need to keep it working"".   This may be good for PTON in the long run."

6/22/2021 22:22,stocks,"Well, with the subscription they can say they’re a cloud technology company with a recurring revenue model. Without it, they’re just a manufacturing company with a direct sales model. Why can’t you whiny consumers ever think of the poor shareholders?? /s"

I have a computer program that I use for my work that requires a dongle.  The company said that they needed the dongles back after I have had it for 10 years because they are switching to an online subscription.  So now if I want to use the program, I am forced to pay for an updated version every year or I have nothing.  I kept the dongle and said no to the subscription."

6/23/2021 9:06,stocks,"You see, as an app user now I have no reason to get a machine. I can just prop my phone or iPad in front of whatever tread or bike and follow along. The experience isn’t that much different."

6/23/2021 9:47,stocks,I don't own a Peloton but I'm sick of everything requiring a subscription service. Soon you'll need a subscription service to drive on public roads.

6/23/2021 10:06,stocks,How do the financials look? They must be burning cash

Making everything proprietary and useless. 2021 F-150’s have a auto shutoff feature that bricks the truck if below 20% oil life and more than 1 qt of oil lost during electronic measurement. Can only unbrick with Ford programming device. John deer was the first company to instill this practice with industrial grade farming equipment. Now peloton bricking their treadmills unless users come to them to resubscribe…  can’t wait for this new generation of companies

6/23/2021 1:26,stocks,"Most ""investors"" aren't seeing the big picture and are confusing noise from actual news.  
  
When the tread killed that kid, I channel checked with sales people at Peloton, and the exact words ""we have had more interest in the tread now that its no longer for sale than ever""  
  
Logic that the masses employ is exactly that, average run of the mill logic. Money is made betting on a contrarian and often misperceived ""truth"". People buy into the FUD headline news without realizing the knock on effects or the second and third order effects.

6/23/2021 5:30,stocks,Quite honestly the way our society is trending towards allowing corporations and material items to completely own us I’d be shocked if the Peloton owners didn’t just go along with it and pay for the subscription. They’re being bricked Ofcourse but anyone buying a Peloton at that price point is doing it for the social value aspects and the allure of the program. These device and app makers can have near total control once they get their hooks in you. Maybe in countries outside the US this won’t go over so well but I imagine they’ll do just fine here in America.
6/23/2021 10:25,stocks,Peloton isn’t an equipment company so this makes sense. Surprised it wasn’t in place from the start.

6/23/2021 9:20,stocks,"I’m in shock! This is awful news. The amount of negative events/news tied to this treadmill is astounding. First the insufficient safety concerns and now this?

The company would be better off just removing this machine from their line up or giving excess to gyms for free just to get rid of it. If they wanted data that badly or a subscription based business model, they could *maybe* partner with gyms so a percentage of memberships is provided to Peloton for providing the machines, along with the data profiles for those gym members. 

Regardless, I think it’s safe to say Peloton is on its way out unless they can fix the damage they’ve done."
6/23/2021 11:24,stocks,"Why is everyone acting surprised? This was their whole business model:  
Idiots pay big money for expensive exercise machine.  
Idiots pay expensive subscription fee necessary to use expensive exercise machine.  
Issue IPO and get more fool's money.  
Profit.  


It combined the worst aspects of the health & fitness field with the technology field.  
Stop subscribing? Enjoy your $3000 paper weight.  


Here's an alternative:  
Go on Craigslist - look for a ""old fashioned"" (read: Non-IOT enabled) tread mill. Buy it for cheap. Attach a tablet to the front of it. Read books or watch Netflix while running.  
Congratulations. you have made your own Peloton.  
Oh, you want it to track your progress? Buy an Apple watch or some other wearable, connect it to your phone or the attached tablet.   
Oh, you want somebody to talk to you while running?  
Go on the internet and pay someone to yell encouragement via Zoom/Skype, any communications system. (I feel this could become a Fiverr gig - ""I will yell at you to lose weight"")  
All of the above suggestions probably come in below the $3000 cost for the Peloton equipment."

There were 22,500 (treated) treadmill-related injuries in the US in 2019, mostly adults, about 2000 children (meaning they had to go to a doctor). Injuries related to exercise equipment should not be so shocking if you see the statistics. About 3 deaths average a year on treadmills. That is just treadmills.

Until those updates can be made and rolled out to our user base, we are giving all Tread + machines free access to our membership platform which includes Tread Lock. We value our members and their friends and families safety over everything we do at Peloton.

Until then, enjoy all the benefits of our membership as a way for us to say thank you for bearing with us as we work tirelessly to fix this issue that should never have happened.""

Logic that the masses employ is exactly that, average run of the mill logic. Money is made betting on a contrarian and often misperceived ""truth"".

A LOT of people enjoy working out from home for various reasons. Intimidation, fear, convenience, germaphobe, the list goes on. Check out a few of the exercise equipment manufacturers, a lot are still largely sold out of equipment. That tells me people are still building home gyms. Of course, many will return to the gym. Many will not, also. I think the at-home fitness industry, specifically tech-connected fitness, will disrupt the gym industry to a degree. 

People don't understand why you would need a subscription service for your exercise, but are forgetting how many people are only extrinsically motivated to workout, they completely rely on those virtual classes/trainers. I personally wouldn't use the service as i'm a gym rat, but i completely understand it and believe this industry has a good future going forward.

You can't be serious.

This is the equivalent of buying a million dollar house and then fitting it with a 200 dollar electric Whirlpool range from Home Depot, even though that Whirlpool range does the same thing as a 8,000 dollar Viking or Wolf range.

People who buy this thing don't care about paying a subscription fee. Most likely their work subsidizes it for them anyways as part of a fitness/wellness subsidy.

6/23/2021 0:11,stocks,These companies will make the same mistake over and over again until the end of time. Why? Because humans are greedy

6/23/2021 1:42,stocks,"Say what you want about subscriptions, but companies use them because they work. I never paid for anything from apple’s iTunes but here I am paying $10 a month for Apple Music."

6/23/2021 6:55,stocks,"Pretty crazy how the safety issue that they fought so hard against acknowledging seems to have pretty much broken management's mind.  

OMG, we are in danger of having our margins cut by a small amount!  Let's blow this up into a big news story!  

OMG, nobody likes us anymore!  Let's do something that is legally questionable to claw back our lost revenues!"
6/23/2021 10:58,stocks,Peloton has always been shit.
6/22/2021 23:57,stocks,"What mistake? Some people will pay for a subscription who otherwise wouldn't, and there may or may not be consequences at some point in the distant future. Sounds like a smart business move to me."
6/23/2021 0:23,stocks,Underrated post. Although I think the actual lesson is going to be less new customers more than lehal action from old ones.

6/23/2021 0:29,stocks,"This is just a rumor. No one's been affected by it yet since everyone has a ""free trial""."
6/23/2021 5:15,stocks,"The market seems to see that: 

Consumer paid for treadmill 

Consumer now is incentivized to pay for subscription 

The increase in extra subscriptions supersedes the individuals who buy a Peloton with intention to solely use as treadmill. (It is overpriced treadmill) 

So basically anyone who’s buying peloton with intention to not use subscription is close to 0, as that individual would just buy a treadmill. 

Market seems to believe consumers will just believe that this is a matter of cost of use. Eg. When you buy a car you have to regularly pay for maintenance : insurance fixed costs that occur with usage."
6/23/2021 7:07,stocks,Ive probably lost more money on good news than bad
6/23/2021 10:44,stocks,Or this just isn't a big deal at all because people buy Pelotons for the content.

6/23/2021 8:50,stocks,"I think this, in combination with rumors that they are exploring wearables is probably part of it."
6/23/2021 8:11,stocks,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure the push upwards is related to that. It's what people have been talking about. The market isn't disconnected."
6/22/2021 21:24,stocks,"That's actually **already** illegal in the US and has been for years (forcing people to go to you instead of third parties for repair services, which the tractor company you mention is infamous for).

6/22/2021 21:29,stocks,You’re right. I forgot about that instance. Didn’t those farmers hack those tractors? I wouldn’t be surprised if someone did the same to their Peloton treadmills. It’s just electronics. Surely someone could figure it out.
6/22/2021 23:57,stocks,The farmers need more hacking allies

6/23/2021 8:55,stocks,"The software stops doing its sexy planning and management, but the tractor can still be driven."
6/22/2021 22:23,stocks,"That’s fine upfront though, known prior to purchase of said tractor.

Even shops like mine who work on them pay a subscription fee."
6/23/2021 0:41,stocks,This is not the same..
6/23/2021 8:19,stocks,"I have yet to meet someone who has read every word and line of it. You're right. As consumers, we do have to agree to terms to turn it on and use it, but that's the point - we can still use the phone. Apple isn't charging us a monthly subscription fee to send texts, check emails, and watch YouTube videos. 

I don't have a Peloton anything, so I could be mistaken in how I'm wording this, but it seems like if you have a Peloton treadmill, you can't just hop on and run if free run is taken away. You can turn it on and I imagine that's about it."
6/23/2021 8:23,stocks,"Apple doesn't have cellphone plans. It would be different if third parties were allowed on the Peloton platform. Maybe they are, I don't know."
6/23/2021 9:52,stocks,Apple is not selling you data service. They’re selling you the device. Your example is like saying you have to buy a “subscription” for a car in the form of purchasing fuel.
6/23/2021 8:29,stocks,"The point here is that they are changing it after the sale has already been made. So no, not like a cell phone plan. What you are referring to is more like leasing and a pretty standard business practice."

6/22/2021 21:33,stocks,"Odd, last I checked I could buy an iPhone and use all apps, camera and whatnot without a sim. In fact I can use all included features except call/text which require a separate service, it's not like the *iPhone itself stops working* so please, try a better analogy"

6/23/2021 8:25,stocks,"You're right. After a while, they do stop supporting older phones forcing upgrades. But you could still use your phone for very basic purposes like only texting and only calling - granted those aren't the only reasons we have smartphones. You get the idea, though."
6/22/2021 21:32,stocks,"What license fee do I have to pay before I read books or watch dvds? None.


I own my vehicles, the manufacturer probably doesn't even make this model any more lol. My doctor? Free of charge, god bless my home country"
6/23/2021 7:42,stocks,"Not sure, it seems to be to customers who kicked off a fuss

I work in a research lab and we use their equipment everyday and before they announced they were backtracking for previous customers, they already got an email from our legal team and told us we were “unlimited free forever”"

6/22/2021 21:14,stocks,"As a peloton (bike) owner and previous investor, I’m so amazed by how terrible their leadership and moves have been recently. They built an incredible product- their motivation system and quality/ variety of classes is amazing. They have a cult following. 

I still love the product but feel they are going to run their future into the ground. I withdrew my investment along time ago. I hope the product as a user stays the same."
6/23/2021 6:32,stocks,Totally have a Lulu vibe.  My urge to short peloton is part emotion and part real strategy.  Garbage leadership
6/23/2021 7:08,stocks,Best comment.
6/23/2021 8:09,stocks,"Maybe. They could turn it around, and even if they don't bad management sometimes takes multiple years to ruin a company (even 2023 puts may not be long enough to realize a good profit).   

Plus Peloton would be a great buyout target for a FAANG company (in particular Apple). If that happens you lose."
6/23/2021 11:59,stocks,Revenue will increase.
6/22/2021 23:00,stocks,"3 deaths a year and one of them is a Peloton is really bad optics for a niche, expensive new product."
6/22/2021 21:48,stocks,It doesn’t matter one bit how often the injuries actually happen. What matters is how often injuries are being publicized.
6/23/2021 11:04,stocks,That’s just OnlyFans
6/23/2021 8:36,stocks,"I agree with you. IoT is a great concept for convenience.

But it also opened a door for: 
- Advertisements,
- software updates that can disable features( like in this case),
- Data collection from companies 

Hopefully they don’t try to pull that with Precor.

[NEW YORK, April 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON), the leading interactive fitness platform, today announced that it has officially closed the acquisition of Precor, one of the largest global commercial fitness equipment providers with a significant U.S. manufacturing presence.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peloton-completes-precor-acquisition-301261010.html)"
6/23/2021 1:10,stocks,"Because it's not *pure design* enough... or, not high enough priority for them to do it to Apple standards.

Same reason some of the default apps are kinda shitty."
6/23/2021 1:46,stocks,"Because both brands have the same consumer base and Apple would rather acquire Peloton than risk competing with them. I’m very confident Peloton will be a part of the Apple Fitness+ platform by the end of 2022, much like Beats became Apple Music in 2016."
6/23/2021 9:52,stocks,"Because Apple doesn't want to make exercise equipment. 

Apple could succeed in almost any industry by just making a quality product that works with their devices. Their standard for entering a new industry is not simply whether or not they could succeed, it's whether or not it would be worth their time effort."
6/23/2021 1:10,stocks,"Seems like they should wait for stock to crash, first."
6/22/2021 21:27,stocks,"Apple created and branded exercise machines are different from 3rd parties that sync to Apple products.

The Apple brand is strong enough that Apple could  provide the exact same functionality as those 3rd parties and a bunch of people would buy it at the prices Peloton charges."
6/23/2021 11:30,stocks,"You are correct. I own the bike and it’s useless for anything unless you have the subscription. You can turn it on and pedal but that’s about it. No speed, cadence, watts or classes. 

I wasn’t aware of the large price difference for non-Peloton users. That’s nuts."
6/23/2021 11:58,stocks,"Probably due to sunk cost. People who bought the peloton are locked in. People on third party equipment can easily use their equipment with or without peloton, so more likely to balk at a high price"
6/23/2021 7:34,stocks,"Something tells me they have arbitration clauses in the existing user agreements that protect from liability. Since they did a recall and created a passcode feature, I don’t understand how this is any different than injuries resulting from a regular treadmill. They’ve changed their minds on removing the feature, so I guess the entire story turns in to free publicity. 

Either way, running outside sounds safer…and cheaper."
6/23/2021 7:37,stocks,"Horrifying. 

I don’t understand how that didn’t come up in QA."
6/23/2021 15:46,stocks,"It's hard to do when the rest of the email is cut off. Bad PR? Yes. Bad journalism? Also yes. Intentional hit-job? Probably.

Edit: Intentional hit-job? Definitely. The ""update"" at the end of the piece contradicts the whole storyline of the article, but still implies that Peloton intends to fuck over its customers."
6/23/2021 9:34,stocks,"Fitness as a service. Customers pay for dynamic, ever changing training from the comfort of their own home.

Nothing I'd pay for but apparently plenty of people do."

6/22/2021 23:25,stocks,Sounds like an unsustainable business model. Bearish on outside

seriously insane how expensive peloton is."
6/22/2021 21:24,stocks,Oh fully agree. I already paused my subscription for two months.
6/22/2021 23:36,stocks,$40 covers the entire household (unlimited memberships) vs the $14 app-based is for a single user.

6/22/2021 23:23,stocks,"For sure.  ~$20 a month for access to any club in the country + unlimited relax/tanning access.  

And back when I used to travel a lot I never visited a club that wasn't well maintained.  

I should've picked up more shares back when it bottomed out last year during Covid."

When I was in the US I used one of these as my temp gym.

Some loser told me to stop deadlifting lol."

6/23/2021 0:58,stocks,But they didn’t make anyone pay. They are giving free months while it’s taken care of.
6/23/2021 0:48,stocks,Peloton is giving them 3 months of free subscription while they work on this.  So they are not making anyone pay any money.
6/23/2021 0:06,stocks,Because they have investors and the litigation cost will be much lower than the long term benefit.
6/23/2021 3:22,stocks,Was it your baby that got killed?

You can carry stuff around in a generic handbag rather than a Chanel.

You can tell time with a Timex rather than a Rolex.

You can get credit using a Capital One credit card, rather than a 550/year silver or dark blue metallic credit card.

The demand is still there and people want to buy this thing. Why are you questioning people's behavior? There's a reason people want a Peloton.

It's a luxury good.

If you need to question ""why?"", sorry mate, you're not the target demographic."
6/23/2021 9:54,stocks,"This is true. But most people with a tread also have a bike, and they’re already in the Peloton ecosystem.

Additionally, the Tread is so much better than an ordinary treadmill. The running experience is totally different.

So even though this seems on paper to be a bad idea, I don’t think the impact is going to be bad at all. I don’t expect it to be reflected in the stock price."
6/22/2021 23:10,stocks,"Markets dumb, it’ll tank when people are scared off from buying more."
6/22/2021 21:50,stocks,Not fake news. They admitted it.
6/23/2021 4:57,stocks,seems like bullshit to me
6/23/2021 14:03,stocks,! Wow
6/23/2021 15:48,stocks,Feels like apple is leaving money on the table.  They are kings in consumer tech hardware and eeverything can be tied into their ecosystem and wearables and brand.  Bundle the subscription into a package with music/tv.
6/23/2021 0:59,stocks,"Im scared my printer is going to do this. The ink cartridges you get through the subscription stop working if you cancel, even if they have ink in them."
6/23/2021 2:07,stocks,At some point people need to stop buying stuff they don't control fully.  The ~~cake~~ cloud is a lie.
6/22/2021 22:41,stocks,"Yep, I thought it was free because the free trial starts automatically. Then after you set it all up and it's running for a month, then they hit you with the paid subscription. 

It's priced cheap enough to where it's not worth uninstalling the hardware. It's infuriating but incredibly smart."
6/22/2021 22:21,stocks,"What the fuck, ring was the one I wanted for home security...nope now"
6/23/2021 8:58,stocks,I have a ring security system. It works just like simplisafe. No subscription required. I imagine the camera's aren't designed for local data storage.
6/23/2021 2:02,stocks,"Part of what I like about ubiquiti cameras is that everything is done locally and features aren't locked out because you didn't pay for the premium subscription, it is more complicated to set up and requires on premises storage, but far cheaper in the long run"
6/23/2021 4:59,stocks,What do you mean by custom boundaries?
6/23/2021 6:00,stocks,"Whoa … even though [it looks like you're talking about multiple Ring units](https://www.safehome.org/doorbell-cameras/ring/) they're a lot more expensive than I expected.

I'd almost expect thieves to be stealing the Rings at that point!  (yes, yes, if they need to be on a network they could be remotely bricked after theft, but still)"
6/23/2021 6:57,stocks,"That's a bit different because all security systems include ""monitoring"" fees. I'm not sure if you actually get anything from Ring other than the ability to use the equipment though.  Someone could probably push it in court if there's literally no service being offered for the subscriptiong, just not here in the US.   They could also just say it is for access to Ring's ""servers.""  Basically you're paying them to spy on you."
6/23/2021 9:05,stocks,"This is false. Ring owner here. The only features you have to pay for is advanced detection of people, and the ability to see and save non live views. Those features cost $3 a month per camera or $10 a month for all cameras."
6/23/2021 9:20,stocks,"There has to balance how Silo ing thier customers in to their ecosystem 

Let’s not pretend companies don’t do it

All about balance"
6/23/2021 11:10,stocks,"To be fair, you are paying for cloud storage and 24/7 access. They don’t restrict total use of the product. I researched this heavily, it is still by far on of the cheapest options with cloud storage."
6/23/2021 0:44,stocks,"After hearing about this I won't ever buy their product unless they stop this overt attempt at a money grab. Even then, I'd probably go with any of the emerging competitors who don't have this awful track record."

6/23/2021 2:23,stocks,"No it's not. 

Peloton customer service stated 'Just Run' is no longer available without a membership and 3 months of All-Access membership has been waived for all owners.  

This was supposed to be for safety. Apparently after some initial backlash a spokesperson said that the safety lock feature was only available for those with a membership and it is working on updating this so 'Just run' can be used again. All in the name of safety of course (BULLSHIT). 

Peloton just tried to force people that bought a $2.5k+ machine to subscribe to a $40/month membership and realized that it won't go over very smoothly so they are back peddling."
6/23/2021 5:59,stocks,"I doubt people want a slightly used tread mill.

After free trial period, many are gonna refund. If pleton go through with this brick function."

6/23/2021 8:04,stocks,You know rumors have a way of destroying a stock.
6/23/2021 5:29,stocks,I agree and quite honestly the way our society is trending towards allowing corporations and material items to completely own us I’d be shocked if the Peloton owners didn’t just go along with it and pay for the subscription. They’re being bricked Ofcourse but anyone buying a Peloton at that price point is doing it for the social value aspects and the allure of the program.

The Peloton bike is decently made and has a huge swing out 22” screen. The Schwinn ic4/Bowflex 6 are good bikes that you can use an iPhone/iPad with and work with almost any app - Zwift , peloton, RGT, Rouvy, FulGaz, etc. Few cheaper bikes work with all the apps right. The $39 peloton subscription with the bike vs $13 without is weird, though I would add the $39 subscription is per household not person like the $13 one.

Mostly because they want to keep things working just as it is, even if the OS hasn't received security updates in 7 years. I've had people running iOS 6 on their ancient mobile hardware because they don't like the new style in iOS 7+. They just keep replacing the hardware over and over with 10 year old refurbished units.

I've been administering apple devices with ASM/DEP/JAMF since before any of that even existed.. all the way back to 10.4 and the original iPhone.. Your belief in whether I'm correct is not needed or required.

If you want to go back to a prior version of iOS, just find the ISPW file that you want and DFU mode it. There are a few ""difficult"" iOS versions, I'll give you that, but most are not.

Apps? The only restriction is if its a 32 bit app that the developer didn't move to 64 bit. Apps aren't just wiped from your device if they are removed from the app store though. I had an unsupported app on my iphone 5 for a while, the developer of the app just shifted to a new app name/title, but the old one was always still there, it just eventually grew less and less useful as it aged out and it became unsupported. Your own apps? You must have missed the boat when Cydia was all the rage in the jailbreak scene. 

If you want older OSX versions just find an ISO or put it into internet recovery mode and you can download the original version that came on the device when new.

If you want to go past what is allowed (like big sur on an unsupported model) there's a whole subreddit for it, or you can look up folks like DOSDude."

Why do people believe it's a better product, then? Because of brand marketing. People see Apple brand, and automatically think ""better product,"" without actually comparing.
You're correct that it's not a status symbol like it used to be (iPhone = look at me, I made it, I have an iPhone), but it is a symbol that people pay extra to carry. Apple brand isn't elite any more, but it's still brand marketing at it's core, and it's the brand the people buy. The status is a different status, but it's a status still."

6/23/2021 0:00,stocks,"Dollar Cost Averaging vs. Lump Sum Investing | Analysis **TLDR:** If you sell your house and have an extra $20k in your bank account you want to invest and let's assume you decide you can't predict the stock market and want to just enter the market.... Don't DCA. Just dump it in the stock market that day and that approach will have been better than DCA 68% of the time. 

&#x200B;

**The Analysis:**

I've seen a lot of people talk about the benefits of [dollar cost averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) (DCA). I was one of them. So I put it to the test. Using the SP500 at-open data (Thank you [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/)), I compared the results of dollar cost averaging vs. lump sum investing.

For every single market day from 2007 to 2019, I compared the performance of a lump sum investment vs. DCA every week for 12 months and looked at the 2-year return from the initial investment date to calculate ROI. I then aggregated the results and came up with a few heuristics to help summarize the findings.

I'm also pretty skeptical of the current market conditions. We're at an All-Time-High (ATH) and I assumed in ATH markets, deferring some of your investments through DCA might yield better results since corrections are more likely in the short-term.

What I found was:

* Lump sum investing yielded better results 68% of the time, and on average returned 4.1% more on your investment than DCA
* Investing in non-ATH markets yielded better results (shocking... /s).
* Surprisingly (still checking the script and data to validate), you had a higher rate of losing 10%+ of your investment through DCA than Lump Sum indicating Lump Sum would be safer which I am still validating because I just don't buy it. I don't think there's anything wrong with the script but triple and quadruple checking to be sure.

&#x200B;

**Next Steps:**

* Validate the output of the script again to triple check results
* Apply statistical significance measures to the analysis to validate the pvalues are in an appropriate range.
* Run the analysis on a bundle of individual stocks where volatility is higher than a broad index to see if that changes anything.
* Run the analysis for periods in the 70s, 80s, 90s to see how things change

&#x200B;

|ATH Flag|All Years|ATH|Not ATH|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Total Inputs|2652|2029|623|
|Lump Win Pct|68.4%|68.4%|68.5%|
|Lump Return Over DCA Pct|4.1%|4.0%|4.3%|
|||||
|Lump Avg. ROI|19.9%|18.1%|25.6%|
|DCA Avg. ROI|15.2%|13.6%|20.4%|

**Methodology:**

The analysis was done using Python in VSCode. Some specifics about the analysis for those interested in the methodology.

* Every market day, I compared investing 100% of the funds vs. investing an equal proportion of those funds every week over 52 weeks.
* I then looked at the market price 2 years into the future for that market to calculate ROI
* If, in 2 years, that day ended up on a weekend I looked for the next Monday
* To determine if market was at an ATH for each investment date, I looked at the max price over the last 60 days and compared that to the max price of the previous 3 years. If the max price of in the last 60 days was >= 95% of the ATH of the previous 3 years, I would flag that day as ""Yes - ATH"". Otherwise it would fall back into the ""No - ATH"" bucket."
6/22/2021 20:50,stocks,Crazy to see this the night before my insane house sale funds cleared. I’m DCAing through an institution or w/e but still.
6/22/2021 21:14,stocks,Personal opinion: DCA=Chasing losses.
6/22/2021 22:39,stocks,"DCA should work well. Just don’t take a whole year doing it since values of companies (supposedly) rise over time. I recently dumped $33k lump on clove at $28. Fuckin regretted that lol. Had I dca’d for 4 weeks my cost average would’ve been in the $12-$15 range. DCA works, just don’t take too long. Not financial advise of course."
6/22/2021 22:53,stocks,"Well logically speaking, of course if you invest early, you get better results. The overall trend of the market is up. When I first learn of dollar cost averaging, I interpreted as more the other way.  Invest your money regularly instead of saving it for one big lump in the future waiting for a dip in the market.  And I think this scenario is much more common than the scenario you are describing.

Most of us aren't going to randomly get a large lump of money. We're going to get a little extra left over after every paycheck that we can invest. The conclusion isn't really DCA vs lump sum. It's whatever can get you in the market sooner.

I'd be curious what your model says if you flip it to account for saving money for a lump sum as opposed to just being lucky enough to get all your money up front. So lets say you got $1k extra each month. Would it be better to invest $1k each month, or would it be better to save it for one big lump sum investment?"
6/22/2021 22:57,stocks,Did you consider trade commissions for DCA? It will also impact DCA yield.
6/23/2021 0:43,stocks,"Thanks for the analysis.  I'm \*hopefully\* coming into a large lump sum for a sale I'm going to close.  I was literally thinking about this a couple of hours ago - ""If I put it into the market would I DCA over a period of time or just drop it all into SP500"".

I guess this answers my thoughts.  Now just gotta hope I can close the deal!"
6/23/2021 1:53,stocks,There is always trade off between risk and reward. You maybe get higher returns 68% of the time but you should take into account that the risk is higher. It is very interesting to know what is the loss ratio when you land on 38% of times where lump sum is a losing strategy
6/23/2021 4:38,stocks,I don't like last decade for such calculations. Will the next be the same?
6/23/2021 5:01,stocks,"It’s actually not that surprising that lump sum is low risk since it’s the higher ROI strategy. Lump summing probably has higher variance, but because it’s higher ROI there’s a lower chance of it going wrong. 

I’m personally in the lump sum camp even though it is less comfortable than DCA.

Doing something like only playing only pocket aces in poker would be a really low variance strategy, but you would go through a lot more downswings than a proper strategy because only play aces is a lower EV (basically ROI) strategy."
6/23/2021 7:50,stocks,This test is super flawed. Do 1997-2014.
6/23/2021 9:08,stocks,"DCA is being used incorrectly if you're doing it as a vessel for long term investment. It's meant to be a hedge for volatility. Applying DCA on a traditionally non volatile underlying such as SPY is the wrong way to use it. DCA tends to make more sense when applied to trading stocks, not investing on index funds.

Additionally I think people misuse DCA to refer to regular contributions to a portfolio. DCA is a single discrete investment deployed across regular defined time intervals with cash already on hand. You're not DCA'ing if you're putting money in each paycheck."
6/22/2021 23:54,stocks,They're *told* DCA is safer. But it's a fail on half of the money whether the price goes up or down.
6/22/2021 21:31,stocks,"All this result is showing is that the market on average goes up. If the market on average goes up, then on average it's going to be better to put money in as soon as possible.

You can fiddle with the DCA period however you want, but with enough samples, as long as the market trends up, it's going to be inferior to investing as quickly as possible."
6/23/2021 5:27,stocks,His data showed DCA is more likely to result in a 10% or greater loss though. Low volatility doesn’t mean less risk  if the other strategies ROI is so much higher it negates the risk.
6/22/2021 22:56,stocks,Damn. That’s rough. Had it gone the other way though you would be kicking yourself for not going all in !
6/22/2021 23:02,stocks,Most platforms these days have free trades so I just assumed no cost to transact. But you’re right. They would eat away at your return big time.
6/23/2021 5:12,stocks,"No it’s not a “pure gamble”. The data and fundamental math is clear.

Every day therefore has a positive expected profit for every dollar you have in the market. The more money you have in the market for more time, the greater your expected profit. The math is pretty simple and the same principles are exactly why professional poker players consistently win. Simply because something has an element of chance doesn’t mean there isn’t a most profitable decision to be made.

If the s&p is going to go up 100% over the next 10 years, then we can calculate your expected return for each and every day in the market and how profitable having money is in the market for any given day. 

Change the numbers around anyway you want, as long as the s&p will yield a lifetime positive return, lump summing will be more profitable on average. Now you can lump sum and still lose out to DCAing, but that doesn’t mean that lump summing wasn’t the more profitable choice at the time. 

Now you might say “that’s ridiculous, how can you say lump sum is better if DCA might yield a better return.”  The key is you have to look at the expected profit. If you have two lotto tickets, one with a 50% chance to win $100 and one with 1% chance to win $101, you should buy the 50% chance ticket.  The results as to which ticket was actually a winner are irrelevant.the first ticket had an expected profit of $50, and the other one of just over $1."

6/23/2021 3:35,stocks,"That's not necessarily true because the market trends up but on a day to day basis, there's a lot of fluctuation. I could see a point where DCA over a week or two period would beat a lump sum on 1 day, but I don't know how often that would happen to make it worth doing."
6/23/2021 2:50,stocks,"68% of the time doesn't mean anything without the magnitude of the losses.

For example would you take this gamble

99% chance to win $1000, 1% chance to lose $100,000,000. Just because one scenario performs better in 99/100 cases doesnt make it a good game.

Moving on from this would you take a 1 time gamble 51% chance to double your money, 49% chance to lose all your money. Mathematically you should... But most people won't, because the money you have is more value to you, than potential gains. 

Hence a small chance to lose 50% of their investment may be large enough risk to outweigh a 68% chance of 4% return for many people."

If you are DCA that pile of cash, whatever you have in the market already will be down, but you can then dump the remaining cash in nearer the bottom and make huge gains on the way back up. 

Considering a the insane bull run and a lot of stocks up 100% over the last year, it seems sensible that now would be the time where DCA is a good strategy. You can miss some gains, but you won't be locking in huge losses like a lump sum might."

6/23/2021 8:00,stocks,Yea I would be curious to see results over different samples. I wouldn’t be shocked if either  minimizes losses although I’m almost positive lump sum will be better over significant samples in terms of total ROI.
6/23/2021 8:37,stocks,"Your comment about the 40% drop is a low risk possibility but it is admittedly  a possibility. 

Your comment about now being a particularly good time to DCA idk if I agree. Have you backtested your theory that the market does poorly the year after it does really well? That would seem to belie the entire premise of momentum investing which has been very successful for the last century."

No but having a look at the historical trend of the S&P500, there's ALWAYS big pullback after huge bull runs. This current run has been one of the steepest of all time. 

https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data

And what is driving this growth? Mostly speculation and money printers in a lot of cases. We aren't thriving, we are just coming out of a pandemic which has done huge damage to the global economy, yet we are steaming ahead into all time highs. Seems a bit manic to me. 

It wouldn't be surprising if we saw a big pullback within the next year or two would it? That seems as good a reason as any not to dump your life savings in one go.

Inflation just means stuff cost more, it doesn't mean you'll make more money to afford it, or that your investments will rise all the same.

6/23/2021 0:00,stocks,"Wash sale: does the number of shares I buy back affect the loss I can claim? Hi fellow investors,

I have looked up wash sale rules in different sources but I am still confused by the scenario below.

In my regular account, I

1. bought 1000 shares stock at $2 per share. Total cost $2000
2. sold all 1000 shares at $1 per share for a loss of $1000
3. bought back 400 shares the next day at $1 (wash sale)

If I keep this position unchanged to the next year, how much loss can I claim?

Someone people say I will not be able to claim any loss since the entire cost basis is added to the 400 shares, which equal to buying 400 shares with $2000. This is what I thought was true.

Today I heard that since I only bought 400 shares, I will still be able to claim the loss for the other 600 shares, meaning I will carry 400/600=40% of total loss ($400 in this case) to the next year, and be able to claim 60% of the loss ($600) this year. I was not able to confirm this from anywhere else.

I lost a lot of money this year and would like to carry some of the loss over to the next year, I thought I could buy 1 share each of those stocks that I took losses, then realize them in the next year.

Apparently, if what I heard today was true, then I would not be able to use minimal funds to carry over losses easily.

What about buying options? Say, in step 3, I bought 10 contract of options which equals to 1000 shares and keep them to the next year (ignore theta decay, etc.). Can I carry over 100% of the loss to the next year?

Thank you!"

I think the market (ESPECIALLY the bond market) thinks we’re heading back to 1-2% inflation soon with rate hikes coming sooner then the fed is letting on, and that is setting things up for a big ol sell off in growth stocks down the road and a pretty unpleasant correction in the near future. 

I don’t know what the catalyst will be, but there will be some data point in the next month or so that’s going to be used to snap the bond market back into reality, and I think a lot of really high fliers (DOCU, PYPL, NVDA, MSFT) are going to correct kinda violently. These are all top-tier companies, and I plan on buying all of them at some point, but the macro economic situation is just too upside down for me at the moment.

I’m just some Reddit dipshit, but you can kind of sense the bewilderment of many smart financial folks on Twitter and TV about the bond market and explosion of growth stocks, while companies that will benefit enormously from higher inflation and massive consumer spending seem to be kind of spinning their wheels or losing value. 

The bond market reaction to Jpow today with the yield retreating again, cemented my view that we’re heading for….something.

I’m not a bear by any means, I think the economy is going to be roaring for the foreseeable future and that tech is an integral part of it, but the timing here makes me very nervous."

Nope I just thought the mall would’ve already been open for an hour when I got there at 11 ish. JC Penney was open so I shopped there until regular mall opened. Occupancy seemed decent but I did notice more non chain stores in spots that used to have chains. I didn’t go in because a lot of times they have super cheap direct from overseas clothes in limited junior sizes. If Wish were a retail store. Not my thing. Once the mall was opened for a bit it seemed to have a fair amount of shoppers. Apple store was packed. I only go inside when I have phone issues. The lego store had a big line.  Don’t have kids, don’t know why. As for Nordstrom they closed during COVID. Before then I saw no indication they were doing badly. The end where Nordstrom’s was seemed kind of sad since Williams Sonoma had previously moved out. Most of the designer shops are at the outlets but from what I saw the mall is doing ok.

And, by the way, I’ve traded GME before and am currently doing so on the long/bullish side via a “bull put spread”, but no one should put more than 2-10 percent of their risk capital (which doesn’t include retirement savings) into it, depending on time horizon and risk tolerance."

6/22/2021 23:51,stocks,"""cash merger event""

That's not normal. It sounds like this wasn't an ordinary dividend and had something to do with an acquisition.

The usual dividend schedues ex-div 2 days before pay-date, to line up with settlement. But there are occasionally weird ones where the ex-div date is some other day, sometimes even weeks after the pay-date, meaning you can get paid the div on the pay-date, and then sell the shares before the ex-div date, and have to pay the div forward to the person you sell the shares to, who may have to do the same if they sell the shares again before the ex-div date.

It looks like RH and others didn't actually read the dividend notice before keying in the ex-div date.

RH owes you the dividend since you sold thinking you'd already earned it, based on their error."

6/23/2021 13:05,stocks,But STAY did merge or get acquired by another company last week.
6/23/2021 8:07,stocks,"2 days now.

The ex-div naturally exists because of settlement. When you sell shares you have two days to deliver the shares. If there is only a pay date and you sell on one of the two days before the pay date you will still have the shares on the pay date, so you will be the one the payment is transmitted to. But you don't own it legally because of the sale, so you (your broker) will have to forward the dividend along with the shares. It's a big hassle that the issuer avoids by saying the shares traded on those days do not have a right to the payment.

But then they can muck it up with the ""record date"" being set before the ex-div date, so brokers are still forwarding payments.

The change in price isn't done by fiat. The market itself decides how to arbitrage the given the fact that the dividend no longer comes to the buyer.

And shares of some securities don't set the ex-div to match settlement. It is up to the issuer, and it can be any time, even weeks before or after the pay date, so in the meantime the people who received the cash are responsible for forwarding it with the shares they sell. It's very rare though, usually only for special dividends that are a large fraction of the company assets. The need to forward cash slows some dividend scalpers."

What government cant do is destroy a business in their attempt to split it up and in this case, spinning things off would severely hurt Amazon thus, even if politicians pass something, it will die in the courts. 

What they might be able to do is spin off Cloud since its not really tied to prime or their retail outlet. In this case, it wouldnt hurt investors at all because they will just get shares in the spin off. The funny part is that it might be worth more on its own anyway so there is a chance you will be richer after the spin off...

6/22/2021 21:39,stocks,"No problem. A lot of people preach what I just said but very few practice it. Last March I had a pretty decent amount of money on the sidelines. I’m now up about 49% since the top in February because I kept buying through the crash. I wasn’t worried about how far it would go down. I just knew that at some point it had to go back up, and that I was getting a much better deal than that I bought at the top. (Speaking of which, I did buy at the top, because I’m always buying, on a consistent basis.)

I’m not an index investor like a lot of people here. Regardless of your strategy, trying to time the market is the worst possible thing you can do. The only thing worse than buying at the top is not buying as the market keeps going higher. You can recover from buying at the top easily by continuing to buy at for cheaper prices. You can never recover from leaving money on the sidelines for a long period of time as the market continues a bull run.  

What you also need to be prepared for is protracted bear markets. Most people under 40 years old haven’t really experienced that yet. It will happen at some point, and that’s when the wannabe investors will be weeded out from the strong. The key is to not listen to the echo chamber of blinkered voices hollering about the end of the world. They’re wrong, and have always been wrong, just like the investors during the dotcom bubble we’re wrong about the new economy in which bear markets were a thing of the past. That’s the beauty of index investing for those who don’t or can’t pick stocks: literally all you have to do is keep buying, and pray that when a crash comes you have even more buying power for whatever reason. If it makes you feel better you could keep 5-10% in dry powder (cash or cash equivalents like treasuries) in case of a correction/crash. But know that the data shows you are likely to lose out because of it, unless you’re participating in more advanced strategies like cash secured puts. 

Bottom line, come up with a plan and stick to it. That plan may change a bit along the way, but in general it shouldn’t change drastically. It’s simple in the end: just keep buying. 

Edit: I should explain why I had a lot of money on the sidelines, Since it goes against what I just said. I had just left a previous job and rolled over my 401(k) to open a Roth IRA. I also haven’t contributed to my IRA that year. So I was able to dump in my entire 401(k), as well as buying $12,000 worth of stocks in both my Roth IRA and traditional IRA, I backdating the purchase in my Roth IRA to the previous year (which you can do up to a certain date), therefore getting the tax deduction from the traditional IRA and being able to dump money into both. 

So basically I got pretty damn lucky. But what wasn’t lucky was the unemotional, calculated decision to keep mechanically buying as the market crashed at record pace. Not for one moment did I flinch as the Pirma bears came out calling for the Great depression part two. No one is more wrong, more often than a bear."

And indeed, we shall see how it goes. So far I’m the one who’s right. I’ve heard this story from everyone since I bought at IPO. First, there was no way they’d grow—they were an outdated tech company going public after lumbering around for 19 years. Now it’s that they’re overvalued—despite extreme customer satisfaction and retention rates. The next milestone they hit will welcome another ten yard goal post shift.

And yes I absolutely agree that software security is important. But they're not the only company in that space. It's very competitive. The first company to go after this was easily the best and biggest, then it made 1 mistake and never recovered. All the others took its market share and ran."

Many people pirate software, but how many ""above the board"" businesses do? They usually keep things ""legit"", and Palantir is run by some very intelligent software people.

6/22/2021 20:13,stocks,"Thanks for sharing. I did about thirty seconds of digging so far. Insta-takes: 

* Market cap has 10x'd in three months. Fear of chasing gains has me wary of entry at this point.
* The share buyback doesn't appear to be the only trigger (gestures at revenue growth). 
* Unusual to see a profitable company trading at such a small market cap. 

Certainly a good place to focus my energy in coming days, mainly to better understand what's driving the revenue growth and scalability, as well as what to expect in coming months. 

What's your CB? Do you have a price target or minimum timeline for ride-or-die HODLing? There's definitely potential here for throwing half a percent at it and seeing what sticks."

6/22/2021 21:54,stocks,I agree with the sentiment except for the magnitude of the event. How many days in a row doesn’t mean much. Everyone has their own cockamamie theory on bearish signals and in the end these things are completely normal. This was very insignificant and should not have affected investors much at all.

6/22/2021 20:47,stocks,"2 business days is the usual deadline and what the market expected, but there are apparently some exceptions to the deadline for form 4 filing per: https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-46421.htm#P100_23326

specifically in relation to 10b5-1c plans as is the case here:

>We are modifying the calculation of the statutory two-business day period as described below for these transactions:

>For a transaction pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of issuer equity securities that satisfies the affirmative defense conditions of Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c) where the reporting person does not select the date of execution, the date on which the executing broker, dealer or plan administrator notifies the reporting person of execution of the transaction is deemed the date of execution, so long as the notification date is not later than the third business day following the trade date.

Not sure what the date of execution is in this case, but theoretically it could have been Friday even though the trades were made on Thursday.

Regardless, I agree that there will be a drop, and I agree it will happen when Dustin stops purchasing. Ascertaining that date is going to be hard."

I sold them today for a 40% loss on the false belief that he stopped buying shares Thursday. I think the rest of the market was betting on that too. We were wrong.

I'm not sure when he's going to stop, to be honest. I would say to look for a Form 4 Thursday night but that has proven futile."

6/23/2021 12:17,stocks,"I think there is room for some type of discussion, and those large private trades were the intended purpose. But as some meme stop surged like GameStop for example the average trade sizes shrank and shrank until it was less than 50 shares, at one point with literally millions of shares moved through dark pools at average size of, get this, 1 fucking share. Dark pools are just a tool to defy true price discovery through supply and demand, manipulate markets, and evade regulations"

6/22/2021 20:46,stocks,"The actual split is July 20th. If you bought shares before market close of June 9th, you qualify for the added dividend payout (3 additional shares worth). Anyone who bought shares after market open of June 9th and before market close of July 19th will get the split, just not the dividend payout. Thats my understanding. If you only hold a handful of shares, your only missing out on a couple of dollars as dividend is $0.16/share.
