2021-06-23 19:45:46,wallstreetbets,"I work for a company that contracts out certain repairs for a few I-buyers. And have seen some unprecedented growth over the last year. We get the most business from Open and they add new major markets almost monthly. I think what separates them is when we saw the reduced business at the beginning of the pandemic the other i-buyers had to pause longer and Open Door bounced back quicker. Iam long on OPEN and exited to see there next earnings ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.If it is an utter disappointment then I will re-evaluate.

2021-06-23 19:42:12,wallstreetbets,But if it‚Äôs selling quickly with multiple offers was it actually‚Äôpriced correctly‚Äô? Read freakonomics for a real insightful take on this exact example.
2021-06-23 19:13:28,wallstreetbets,I see your connection here but Opendoor isn't the apple of buying and selling homes and when talking brand awareness Zillow is the most recognizable. Apple had the iPhone. Opendoor had buying for convince but seems now that Zillow can offer the same and just price them out
2021-06-23 19:45:28,wallstreetbets,This market is a freak show. Who knows what‚Äôs correct anymore.  But a bidding war is always good for the seller. And I‚Äôm seeing them with no inspections no contingencies. So when I hear open door say they want 5% + $2k I want to stay away

2021-06-23 19:54:17,wallstreetbets,"I've been long on Canoo since March and BrotherLuminous' famous DDs here.

It's nice to see more DDs for GOEV here, especially since this sub had aversion since the SP beating in March. 

Everything lines up great for GOEV from now on - the company has been silent for the longest time, but last week's investor day pretty much invalidated all of bear thesis. The lockup expiration wasn't that bad either.

> Lost my summer boat money on weeklies last week

As you I left a hefty sum last week - did not take profit on the pop on Tuesday, still holding strong to other monthlies (mainly July and August, rolling them out as necessary).

I've been tracking this ticker closely for the past months, especially SI data reported by Ortex. I'll try to give you technical overview and will skip fundamentals as u/killa-bee-lion summed it up nicely (also there are two good DDs last week on the sub, look for it).

The SI in this ticker is 37%, and [Ortex reported 8% increase yesterday](https://u.teknik.io/dl70U.png) (sic! this is most likely SI accumulated on Friday, because Ortex reports on settlement date T+2). Utilization has been hanging in the 95-100% range for the past 2 months. CTB is on average 35% (as reported by Ortex, personally I see ~27% in IBKR), this week IBKR run of out borrowable shares (which hasn't happened in a few weeks) and some folks report that brokers reach out to them to borrow shares.

There's high OI in $10-$20 range expiring in July and August, and we've seen ramping OI closer to monthly expiry consistently for the past 4 months (to the tune of 80k OI >$10 last Friday). 

What's even more interesting is that there has been price capping going on in the last hour of trading tonight - basically we were pinned to $10 with 1c candles for most of the hour - which suggest someone really doesn't want it to push higher. And that is something I have trouble figuring out why - after all as you said there's Russell inclusion coming up on Friday, some 13mm shares to be bought (with ~40mm shares SI). It is a massive buying pressure given that GOEV has 5.5mm avg volume. I'd thought shorts would run for the doors in this case, but alas that hasn't happened as of yet.

To sum up, GOEV has a significant SI and its shares are becoming harder to borrow. It's definitely squeezy - just look up price action on Tue, June 8th and Tue, June 15th - nice pops in the range of 15%. Shorts are still there and we've been speculating on the other sub that $10 may be a real pain point for them as they had relentlessly shorted GOEV after borked March earnings call, lowering their avg price significantly.

Please make your own conclusions, but I think the tide is finally changing for GOEV and we might see shorts popping especially after Russell inclusion."
2021-06-23 19:21:09,wallstreetbets,Excellent time to get in. Looks very bullish in the short term as well. You forgot about Russell inclusion.
2021-06-23 19:23:23,wallstreetbets,I bought after the lockup period. Only up from here

2021-06-23 18:41:14,wallstreetbets,"I know someone who bought gme at 400, averaged down to 100 and got his money. If you believe in your stock  and have done your own DD, it is a good strategy."

2021-06-23 18:52:24,wallstreetbets,Aka don‚Äôt buy the dips of a position you believe in. What kind of retardary is this
2021-06-23 18:53:50,wallstreetbets,"Fuck that, #3 is the only sound reason in this list. On several occasions I've gone from red to green on my plays exactly because I averaged down when initial bets didn't go the way I thought they would. If my conviction is stong enough, it's worth my time and money. If someone's just chasing the dragon, that's a whole different story... those people should go watch trainspotting and consider the fact that their money is basically the baby in that scene I'm sure some will remember"

2021-06-23 19:58:59,wallstreetbets,"The people who averaged down on Apple back then were probably ridiculed in the same way and tone like you just did for Blackberry holders. 

Blackberry has a great future outlook. Just a matter of time before they realize their potential."

2021-06-23 19:46:14,wallstreetbets,All I do is do put credit spreads on this 6 weeks at a time. I‚Äôve collected over 10k and closed most out at 75 percent profit. I just keep on repeating until winter.

2021-06-23 19:30:15,wallstreetbets,"Already did. Still I'm looking for that best triple play combo pattern.ET doesn't have better div, Options IV, and their price actions are similar.

ET is not bad, but XOM is better for the pattern.

A lot of people like ET because of its cheap price and hope for a big potential run up. I'm looking for the best percentage pattern combo profits -- eliminate more of the hope part."

March and October of last year made me soooo much money.  


Wish I had scored OMP though. It was paying 70% yield at the low..."
2021-06-23 18:18:53,wallstreetbets,I feel the same way! Profits say the same thing -=)
2021-06-23 18:30:30,wallstreetbets,Can't compare OXY to XOM. OXY got no real div and higher Options IV -- no triple play combo pattern.
2021-06-23 19:38:51,wallstreetbets,"the fu\*k is that...haha, joking."
2021-06-23 19:52:04,wallstreetbets,"Nice, and congrats to you!  


The triple play combo pattern can get return of 6-7 figures in 12 months as long as oil can maintain its level. But you do you."
2021-06-23 18:23:03,wallstreetbets,Seriously where are these people when oil took a dump? I loaded up on oil last year when everyone was selling.  ROFL.
2021-06-23 18:22:18,wallstreetbets,"My profits say otherwise.

But if you can elaborate on your trolling..."
2021-06-23 18:31:14,wallstreetbets,"Understandable, however OXY has been majorly outperforming and options have been going really well"
2021-06-23 19:42:09,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd like to buy the dip but it never dips.

That oil trust used to be $60 with a 1.5% monthly dividend.  18% annual.  Low oil, and recently Short sellers destroyed it.  I think oil is bullish until at least the day Kamala leaves office."
2021-06-23 18:27:31,wallstreetbets,FANG stocks was the shit last year. Commodities like Crude Oil especially $XOM and meme stocks are this year.
2021-06-23 18:35:37,wallstreetbets,"$XOM has year-to-date return of %54+ and is set to break $64.50 resistant to another new 52-week high -- can be as soon as tomorrow.

OXY ain't bad, but XOM take the triple play combo pattern for big $ play."
2021-06-23 19:47:44,wallstreetbets,Looks into XOM...buy what you like.
2021-06-23 18:37:33,wallstreetbets,"I like OXYs high volatility, monthly and yearly chart are great"
2021-06-23 18:41:21,wallstreetbets,"So is XOM, low Options IV with big potential gain and price actions are as good as any other Crude Oil Stocks or even better, plus massive dividends play that most other don't have. Oh, it has the capacity to raise it dividends even higher this year with Bank of America PT @ $90."

2021-06-23 19:35:29,wallstreetbets,I thought about this while eating my banana and I think you should buy a house. Not much is riskier than not being able to pay a mortgage and losing a roof over your head.
2021-06-23 19:31:33,wallstreetbets,"I have a view against the media actually.

Starting to think with the levels of debt we have in the system we actually need a decent amount of inflation to make the debt worth less, and so contrary to popular belief that rates will rise. 

For me I am in tech, because 

a) tech business is booming and projected to continue

b) if there is not inflation,  then maybe banks are at risk actually, with their record breaking leverage positions and CMBS's that could default (some data to support some defaults already https://www.fitchratings.com/research/structured-finance/us-cmbs-2020-loan-default-study-defaults-surge-to-new-high-during-pandemic-26-04-2021#:~:text=The%202020%20cumulative%20default%20rate,%25%20from%200.8%25%20in%202009.)

It may not be sensible to raise rates for some time. Meanwhile, tech/semiconductor/innovation demand remains for big players who will consolidate the market most likely. 

c) if there is inflation, tech debt will become worth less, enabling the prospect of using debt to fund growth given the true underlying demand for product.

So either way, I see certain tech stocks (not all) performing well. I would pick the big boys with lower P/E's that will consolidate or growth companies with strong government/whale backing. I am avoiding companies barely surviving for the most part (exception short and gamma squeeze plays of course)."

It‚Äôs actually good for the market to have inflation. However, the concern right now is how the fed will react to the inflation in the economy. Seems like the market right now is bullish on short term plays know that the fed will raise rates next year. Even if you buy into the idea that inflation is transitory the fed will still have to raise rates eventually. There‚Äôs also talks of another 6 trillion in stimulus coming.

2021-06-23 18:36:13,wallstreetbets,"Correct it‚Äôs still inflated from supply/demand issues which is a form of ‚Äúinflation‚Äù and there is always a level of inflation which is good for a healthy currency, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that we will see the ‚Äúhyper inflation‚Äù or prolonged spikes in inflation that will have lasting damages on the economy."
2021-06-23 18:41:46,wallstreetbets,I guess I should have clarified. Inflation exists and will always exist. It is required in order to maintain a healthy currency. But the concept of wild hyper inflation that will damage the economy etc is what I am refuting

2021-06-23 18:37:34,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs my opinion on it. Just because we have inflated prices or ‚Äútemporary inflation‚Äù due to the lockdowns and unusual circumstances, doesn‚Äôt mean that we will have prolonged inflation or hyper inflation that will damage the economy"
2021-06-23 19:58:33,wallstreetbets,Jerome is that you?
2021-06-23 18:57:10,wallstreetbets,Well the fact that there are bills being proposed that would add another 6 trillion dollars of debt and the federal reserve said they will be raising rates eventually is the concern. If rates weren‚Äôt near 0 and the market isn‚Äôt overvalued (personal opinion) then you would have nothing to worry about. Inflation is actually good for markets but high inflation that causes the federal reserve to raise interest rates is the concern. The reason they‚Äôre carefully watching data for any anomalies is to see if there are things that would indicate that inflation is not transitory so they can act accordingly. Knowing that if they let it get out of hand then they risk a recession.

https://i.imgur.com/FiKgcAP.png"
2021-06-23 19:23:43,wallstreetbets,Similarly people are constantly making the error between this product is experiencing inflation and hyperinflation - which is an entirely different concept that is not being experienced.
2021-06-23 19:59:46,wallstreetbets,Shhhh keep it a secret
2021-06-23 19:08:29,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm personally in the camp that doesn‚Äôt care about the national debt. It‚Äôs not a big factor when it comes to inflation and at the current levels it has room to grow before it outweighs the benefits of debt-leveraged investment. I‚Äôm not a big advocate of wasteful government spending (don‚Äôt want to get too political in here, but I don‚Äôt like the proposed bills), but it can‚Äôt be said on a blanket approach that more government spending = bad debt = inflation.  

For the interest rates, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a reactionary approach, but rather a normal shift due to their protective approach against Covid. They lowered rates during Covid in order to ease up the money supply to provide more liquidity to survive the lockdowns. They will gradually raise them back to normal levels, not due to inflation, but due to the lack of the need of excess liquidity as the economy is back in full swing. The markets will freak out for sure, because they love to overreact, but in my opinion it‚Äôs more of a sign of a successful Covid survival plan rather than a reactionary move against inflation."
2021-06-23 18:39:46,wallstreetbets,"Prices are still higher than pre-Covid, which is expected. But temporarily inflated prices due to unusual circumstances does not guarantee that it will be prolonged or continue to increase."
2021-06-23 19:26:24,wallstreetbets,"Right. In my opinion, people tend to incorrectly correlate inflated prices with hyper inflation without taking into account the varying circumstances around the inflated prices."
2021-06-23 19:20:28,wallstreetbets,"True. If you‚Äôre long on the market none of this matters to you because the market will eventually surpass every high. However, in reality, most people on here are not. Without naming names I would be less concerned if there weren‚Äôt stocks out there that can dramatically move the market if there was a sell off because it‚Äôs not based on any core fundamentals. Coupled with the fact that there are a lot of new investors that will panic sell as things are going down causing the dip to be bigger. Hedge funds and smart money can shift their portfolio to other emerging markets if they feel that the US market is too much of a risk and they have been saying they‚Äôre starting to do this. So in this kind of environment it‚Äôs better to hedge and dial back on risk if you‚Äôre not someone who will hold the stock for the next 10 years."
2021-06-23 18:42:27,wallstreetbets,Nor does it guarantee it won‚Äôt! I‚Äôm bit the one bragging it‚Äôs down 50% when it‚Äôs actually inflated 260%
2021-06-23 19:41:52,wallstreetbets,100%!
2021-06-23 19:29:35,wallstreetbets,Definitely true. High risk plays are even riskier right now because everyone is on the edge about the panic selling that can be induced from either wrongly interpreted economic data or overly cautious hedging.
2021-06-23 18:52:14,wallstreetbets,"Yes it‚Äôs still inflated compared to pre-Covid, but it‚Äôs already on its way back down as states open up and more workers go back to a full demand schedule. My opinion is that we will continue to see it drop back to normal levels as things get back into full swing"
2021-06-23 18:58:53,wallstreetbets,What leads you to believe that? The quickly dropping fuel cost? (Sarcasm) Biden‚Äôs proposed doubling of Canadian Tariffs? Minimum wage increases?
2021-06-23 19:42:15,wallstreetbets,"Fuel cost was another supply and demand issue due to the current administration‚Äôs shut down of pipelines. Raising tariffs is always a poor economic choice because it introduces extrinsic negative pressure on supply and demand to artificially drive down supply (which will add to price increases). Minimum wage increases add extra costs to goods which inflates the prices leading to lower demand. All of these scenarios cause inflated prices, which in a normal economic setting would have nominal impacts, but they are only exacerbated due to the current prices already being inflated. In my opinion, since the current price inflation is only due to temporary circumstances, these extra negative economic policies will only extend the timeframe of prices moving back down by a bit, and not stop the deflation altogether. Prices will still go back down, high inflation will still not be seen, and these policies only add an extra bump in the road. All again, just my opinion"

2021-06-23 18:36:22,wallstreetbets,"Legal short selling is necessary for price discovery on scam/fraudulent/manipulative companies as OP stated.  Their needs to be a reward for the time spent uncovering fraudulent behavior.  We are, after all, a capitalist country.  Many times, these reports require months of undercover work.  Watch the China Hustle if you don't believe that some of these guys putting in work to save investors a shit ton of misery later on.

Also, legal shorting is good against a company you believe in.  If it is legal, your DD is right and shorter DD is wrong, then the shorts provide the easy move to the next price level and then some.

In normally functioning markets, legal short selling is a net positive.  It helps prevent bubbles, it can prevent overselling (covering can form bottom on selloff), and provides incentives for finding fraudulent companies.  All in all, our markets are much more stable because of shorting.  This is good for retirement accounts.  Not so much for degenerate gamblers who live off wild meme hype buying.

I have read quite a few nice papers on the added value of short sellers, and these papers were obsolete - not taking into account that someone could enter the market as an actively disseminating shortseller. With these guys in the game, who get much more immediate remuneration/gratification, the game is shifting.  


China hustle was nice, but shorties are withdrawing from China - it reeks of political risk and you could step on wrong toes (like the infamous Citron real estate fuck-up that got him banned in Hong Kong) + in Asia you will be viewed as some whitey cunt that tries to slander their way of capitalism - there is only one shortie who was consistent with anti-Sino campaigns, Matt, but I haven't seen anything from him in a long time.  


Great that you mention legality. I went over last 10 years of lawsuits and fuckups, that shortsellers broght upon themselves. It's surprisingly slim. Sure Rota Fortunae got a subpoena and some shit, but none of those reports so far (or at least those that I have seen in Dockets) ended with a lost case. Especially none covering ""bigger"" shortseller. These guys know what they do and do not throw around the ""F-word"" (fraud) very often, even if it's actually a fucking fraud to the bones. Penumbra being one of the cases.  


  
Overall, I just don't get this hive mind shit. People are jumping on meme stocks too late only to get 20-30% at best and then diamond hand that shit until their calls expire worthless. I have no agenda here, being on both sides of the barricade, but 25% return going short @ 70% probability of early exit is somewhat better than diamondhanding a shitco with 500% return @ 2% likelihood."
2021-06-23 18:29:06,wallstreetbets,"Right now?  


Nothing.  


I am not in the shorting game for long term short-gains. That's too much pain for too long.   
Fuck morality and fuck conviction. I want to see fat dips in 3-5 days. See a campaign, read it, understand its nuances and strengths, buy puts, short the stock and bounce once you hit 20-50% on your investment.  


I will let the good guys deal with the rest- such as pushing down the company to bankruptcy or causing a witch hunt (like WDI or Penumbra, which was absolutely hilarious)"
2021-06-23 18:32:06,wallstreetbets,"I am expecting some good campaigns in July. There are some new faces on the market, some guys who want to go for the kill, and kill it will be in some cases this time.  
Most of all, the market finally became ripe and responsive. Good Campaign -> good response -> 10-30% down in a week. Not like fucking 2020, when every crayon eater suddenly became a contrarian to new information."
2021-06-23 18:24:38,wallstreetbets,"Appreciated.  
Yet effort there was none.  
Mere anger and rant, after all the great campaigns I have seen in 2020.  
\[We are fishing here for 100-200% gains on some no-name shitco yet 10-20% move in stock are happening every week\]"
2021-06-23 18:32:58,wallstreetbets,You should trade u/'s with him
2021-06-23 18:06:18,wallstreetbets,"It's painful game that can cost you, but it's a fair fight I can get behind morally (whatever morals I have left in me). Shitheads trying to get rich off of naive markets get a taste of the truth serum from time to time.   
One campaign I still have in mind is last year's Forescout (FSCT- no longer listed). Ben, of Spruce Point, pointed out some sever flaws and that shit tanked 20-30% in a matter of few days. That was lovely.  


Anyways, very unpopular game.  
Cheer!"
2021-06-23 19:11:43,wallstreetbets,"Me too brother. Find the green shoots, lick the cream off and fuck off before it gets red hot (i.e. mentioned on yahoo and bloomberg as WSB popular stock...). For me, shorties are just another way of getting the cream before the rest of the market realizes some shit is up."
2021-06-23 19:14:35,wallstreetbets,"That's just the modus operandi, imho.   
I haven't seen many of the true short-seller guys asking for sympathy and I am convinced, some of them got burned massively before they got their tendies.  


For now, that's how those blokes operate. Present a thesis on twitter, spam the shit out of it, since most of us smoothbrains won't open the pdf to read it whole, and - lastly- feed the algos leeching on twitter with re-tweets and clicks. They are in for the buck, not for the thumb ups and kudos. And I respect and like the straightforwardness."
2021-06-23 18:41:16,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the comment, no idea how yelling at a bot works or should work (I only leech, no OC)

I am not trying to change the world or convince ape kids to suddenly listen to reason. I only had to release some pent up anger and shit, accumulating for way too long after Shitron left the game (and, my apologies to Citron if I am unjust but he was precisely one of the shortsellers with no morals and DD, only causing panic selling with his huge following and providing no substance + undercutting other shortsellers like a sleazebag he was from time to time)

There is no unity here but there is certainly group-think. I have seen way too many retard-plays going way too far merely on the basis of collective beliefs, only to tank few days later. Quite likely hedge fund plays systematically released to WSB to dump some shit.

For once, I would like to see these broke children make a reasonable bets, that can generate some actual short term value and provide a dollar-manifestation of reprimand to all these cunts on the market. (I mean, what the fuck is the post-Spac and current IPO market, are they shitting us?)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\+ EDIT: WSB is no longer a few milion sub. AMC is like 80% retail owned. There is upwards of 10mil crayon eaters now. Why not push them in the right direction and show that fucking over lazy-DD Pension funds is not tolerated in our generation (whatever you age is..)."
2021-06-23 19:38:31,wallstreetbets,It's a bear with a big ole swingin dick.
2021-06-23 19:09:34,wallstreetbets,"I respect your point, but in these times, capital markets are just one of routes to take if you want to raise capital.  
Not to get too deep into financial theory and signalling, but equity market (after you have raised your capital and rewarded the early believers) should reflect strengths and weaknesses of the company. Nowadays, none of these are reflected, because FED and other CBs are pumping so much money in to the system, that retards, like me and you,  can get leverage at 3% and long whatever bullshit we damn please. And there is a lot of bullshit out there.  


I have heard the arguments, that shorting is un-american, anti-capitalistic and what not, but I am convinced the opposite is the truth. Not everyone with traded equity has the best intentions wrt the public and payoff for obscuring your insides is way too sweet (going all the way back to Jensen in 80s).  
Reward for uncovering a true crooked cunt should be warranted. (look at the early days of Kerrisdale and Muddy Waters, those Chinese companies entered the market just to grab US cash and bail out without repercussion)"
2021-06-23 18:01:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, fuck. Forgot about that one. But given what was going on in February (EDIT..), I cannot imagine that RH would allow shorting.They would get a big-boy margin all in no time. Good and bad at the same time, when the only direction you can bet on is up."
2021-06-23 18:49:12,wallstreetbets,Yep this!
2021-06-23 18:46:40,wallstreetbets,"Slightly more complicated and involves the IPO investment banks, brokers and short-seller intermediators.  
But, in essence, I agree with you.  
Short companies, that deserve shorting. Shitbag CEOs trying to get rich on naivet√© and laziness.  


Anyways, good hunting, if you are with us on the sinking, stinking and chaotic shorting-dinghy."
2021-06-23 19:58:39,wallstreetbets,"No reasonable shortseller goes after companies mentioned on WSB. Not worth the risk, even if you have a solid campaign, you just wait a couple of months to publish it after WSB interest cools off and latecomers get pissed that they did not make their promised tendies."
2021-06-23 19:55:44,wallstreetbets,"Please do so. Hopefully some benjamins will be going your way, my smooth brained fellow"
2021-06-23 19:18:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeaaah, Citron is a chapter on his own.  
He had some good bets and some fucking awful ones. But I haven't followed his campaigns (haven't traded on them) since like 2018. Not to foulmouth anyone, but that guy reeks of self-serving hype-driven pseudo-campaigns with no arguments.  


I follow shorts that present the whole thesis - why they think it's shit, how shitty it is, and how much you are getting fucked in the rear by smearing that shit on your cheeks. I want a DD not a pamphlet (sorry Andrew..)"
2021-06-23 19:57:01,wallstreetbets,"Quite aged, in fact. Still remembering guys trying to get a loan through their brokers and playing disfunctional controls on young RH. Good and bad times (no traction behind bad ideas. Bad ideas were just bad)"
2021-06-23 18:33:17,wallstreetbets,"I'm personally having a blast watching the shorts burn. They are bottom feeders that enjoy watching a company slowly succumb to the pressures of their ability to run the business while the short sellers keep the squeeze on. I would say 1 in 50 short seller reports have something of substance, the rest are all recycled bullshit and disgruntled former employees."
2021-06-23 19:18:19,wallstreetbets,What you just described Is the opposite of straight forwardness and straight up being a lying dick
2021-06-23 18:42:59,wallstreetbets,"Don't let what other people do get under your skin, and don't expect anything on WSB to be a reasonable bet."
2021-06-23 18:02:40,wallstreetbets,That actually makes sense I didn‚Äôt think of that.
2021-06-23 19:26:38,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah believe me i read his short ‚Äúthesis‚Äù on NiO when it tanked the price like 30% on its first run up to 50 -60 range. Ive read better DD on reddit. Seriously it was garbage. He could have said the same things he said about nio about a plethora of other companies that had less going for them in the tech sector. Literally nothing groundbreaking or fraudulent about the company. All he said was the valuation was high...yeah bud, check out like 90% of the market right now? Lol."
2021-06-23 19:26:24,wallstreetbets,"Squeeze became somewhat a buzzword in this forum, it's pretty hard to squeeze a billion dollar company as a 100mil outfit.  
I am not talking about Citadels and Melvins, but small short seller groups that cover 1-2 ADV of the stock with their short at most. Far far from any kind of squeeze.  


To be honest, what Citadel and Melvin did earlier this year was a prime example of going full retard. I am surprised that Melvin is still operating, Markowitz-Tobin 101 or eggs in basket, whatever you call it.   


Anyways, I respect your view. Short-sellers are hardly likeable, profiting from failure of others. But they are exactly the bottom-feeders/ carps, that clean the nonsense and foul-smelling shit presented to us as a candy bar"
2021-06-23 19:42:07,wallstreetbets,"Spot on.  


My skin is as thick as Walmart cashier's callus heel.  


I left reason at the door when entering this god-forsaken lair of nihilists.  
Anyways, cheers for the comment and best of luck for the rest of 2021."
2021-06-23 19:27:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah dude, nothing on WSB is reasonable bet...üôÑ"
2021-06-23 18:11:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, there are still some plays I am actually worried about, that WSB should  not find about.   
Actual doomsday plays, that could fuck the market up better than the GFC and Lehman extra-extended dildos. The worst thing, dudes here are nihilistic enough to go after it. So let's hope, we, the autists, will stay oblivious to these sort of plays. (I would still like to retire one day with a 401k style account at my disposal)"
2021-06-23 19:39:08,wallstreetbets,"And I completely agree. Some of Citron's reports weren't reports but mere calls for action from his 100k twitter followers. I have analyzed (and got burned, shame on me...) a couple of his ""long"" theses, which, after due consideration, were just hypes for him to dump to stock. Saying that this or that stock has a +150% potential and riding the  volume to clear you fund is not the way to keep your followers satisfied.  


Honestly, fuck Citron. He was too popular and made a bad name for other short-sellers that actually took the job seriously.  
Hard to deal with a bitter aftertaste as a retail trader, if you burned through 10% of your 9-5 portfolio and look at guys like Gabriele (Cohodes 's pet guy), who want to see blood."

2021-06-23 18:45:10,wallstreetbets,Maybe if you got in at $10..
2021-06-23 17:55:45,wallstreetbets,Shorts are trapped. You can also tell by the anemic trade volume for the last few weeks. 55 million shares outstanding with 8.3 million shares shorted. RAD hasn't done an average volume trading day in month. With the new shorting rules going into effect. I really don't see how they can cover. This statement from the CEO is a positive earnings beat kind of verbiage without just saying it.
2021-06-23 18:19:09,wallstreetbets,Man I was trying to sell a put all day should have just yolo a few call options.
2021-06-23 19:09:38,wallstreetbets,"200 at 22 and change, but looks like fun earnings play hmmm"
2021-06-23 19:44:14,wallstreetbets,I have been doing Technical Analysis on RAD and there is no resistance up to $40. The small  amount at $27 and $32 could be just a brief pause. RAD has only been suppress by Naked Shorting. Without Shorts continuing to short. RAD will spike higher. Shorts will lose $160 million for every $10 increase in price.
2021-06-23 18:35:52,wallstreetbets,Supersweet!  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
2021-06-23 19:03:28,wallstreetbets,"If WSB got behind this one, it truly could moon.

Only 55 million shares outstanding (20 million less than GameStop).

60% of the outstanding shares owned by institutions and mutual funds.

Of the remaining 22 million shares floating, more than 8 million have been shorted.

Considering this stock grew 9%+ last year and recorded $24 billion in revenue, it is ridiculous that RAD has a market cap barely about a $1 billion.

If people realized the fundamentals behind this one, it could soar.

By the way, here are some fundamentals on Rite Aid...

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2ww7t/rite\_aid\_rad\_earnings\_due\_out\_next\_week\_june\_24/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2ww7t/rite_aid_rad_earnings_due_out_next_week_june_24/)"
2021-06-23 17:53:30,wallstreetbets,I agree.  I don't think many people have seen the article and interview given by the Rite Aid CEO.  The article was only released at 4:40 PM ET tonight and does not appear to have been picked up by the newswires yet.
2021-06-23 19:17:29,wallstreetbets,I think that's more to do with there isn't a lot RAD shareholders willing to sell. Institutional ownership has been increasing. Fintel shows 75%. Shorts are negative 15.5% Retail ownership is over 35% and could be 40% to 45%. Shorts have use Naked Shorting to suppress RAD's price for a few years now. In 2019 after a big time beat. RAD traded 103 million shares the next day after doubling in price. I don't think they can do that today with the new rules.
2021-06-23 19:21:27,wallstreetbets,"That's because we never thought of using Reddit to get the word out. RAD has been a victim of Naked Shorting for over 2 1/2 years. Mostly I have been posting on Yahoo's RAD message board, but we are not fake. Believe whatever you like. The math says it all. 55 million RAD shares outstanding and with 8.3 million shares shorted."
2021-06-23 19:22:34,wallstreetbets,Tell that to Michael burry
2021-06-23 17:58:13,wallstreetbets,Not a lot of people realize this....this is such a perfect stock to get behind.

2021-06-23 18:05:03,wallstreetbets,There are not enough RAD Call Options to save them. Shorts have been Trapped for 3yrs now and people are finally catching on. RAD could go on a GME style runner. This is no bullsript! It's all in the math.

Hey /u/erniekim, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit."
2021-06-23 17:49:00,wallstreetbets,"As a nurse Im conflicted by this. I work with a lot of folks who wear figs, they‚Äôre deffinately popular. Much of your thesis sounds great. That said, they seem limited by marketing to a specific body type.  A body type that in my impression, is the minority of health care workers. Additionally, there are more and more imitators that are well established scrub companies pushing into their market. Could they become the underarmour of healthcare, possibly? Personally, my job can be absolutely filthy. I have a hard time buying designer scrubs just to get shit, bled, and pissed on. Maybe that‚Äôs just me? Lastly, last year they had an ad campaign that was pretty tone deaf, and insulting to many healthcare folks. Not really a fan of that. A scrub company shouldnt be getting involved in water cooler politics. It was pretty terrible marketing. They should stick to letting cute travel nurses tagging them on IG. I‚Äôm not trying to torpedo your dd, just offer another perspective."
2021-06-23 17:36:06,wallstreetbets,"FIGS is going to be dumping in a few days when the flipping rule is off.

For the first 30 days after an IPO, investors are not allowed to sell their IPO shares. This is called flipping. After the 30 days they are permitted to sell. Since FIGS is up 60% since the IPO, there will be quite a bit of selling demand.

Wait until after that 30 days."
2021-06-23 17:31:28,wallstreetbets,"Here‚Äôs what I know, my wifey is a nurse and fucking loves figs‚Ä¶and her ass looks great in them. Sold."
2021-06-23 17:56:57,wallstreetbets,i will be shorting them because im pissed at how expensive they were when i got them
2021-06-23 19:29:55,wallstreetbets,Used to eat fig newtons as a kid. I‚Äôm all in.
2021-06-23 17:45:53,wallstreetbets,No idea on the stock but as a nurse Figs are popular af at my hospital and make quality scrubs- albeit for people on the skinnier side
2021-06-23 17:56:23,wallstreetbets,Wish I had bought when they first hit the scene.  Everyone I know who owns a pair loves then
2021-06-23 17:29:58,wallstreetbets,I have a screen shot of the position but can't load here.  Any suggestions?
2021-06-23 17:58:14,wallstreetbets,"I saw that ad, I remember thinking they should have fired whoever was behind that ad because it was downright stupid and insulting.  Now the ad on their website directed to female DOs is much much better but I can‚Äôt believe people looked at the original and decided it was a good idea to post that"
2021-06-23 17:37:58,wallstreetbets,Very possible.  Willing to hold it and add more when there is a dip.
2021-06-23 17:40:19,wallstreetbets,My wife and her boyfriend make sex tapes in FIGS for their nurse roleplays. Bullish.
2021-06-23 17:38:07,wallstreetbets,I bet her boyfriend is a doctor that also wears figs... bullish
2021-06-23 17:35:26,wallstreetbets,I have family members in healthcare and the fit in phenomenal.
2021-06-23 19:39:53,wallstreetbets,Haha
2021-06-23 17:46:53,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs what I hear as well; hence, participated in the IPO and got more shares after."
2021-06-23 17:57:07,wallstreetbets,I hear this over and over again. Tempted buy more
2021-06-23 18:03:09,wallstreetbets,"Right? This company wants money, and is gonna insult their key demographic? Ok,lol"
2021-06-23 17:56:35,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll be watching for the dip, the only thing I hate is that they‚Äôre so fucking expensive, but made in Vietnam which pisses me off"
2021-06-23 19:11:35,wallstreetbets,I need to Google this ad.

Hint: they love em."
2021-06-23 17:12:15,wallstreetbets,I agree that ASO has more upside BUT I think the success of DKS is good for ASO. It not only keeps ASO‚Äôs management from getting complacent but it‚Äôs also serves as a sign that the industry is healthy.
2021-06-23 17:13:11,wallstreetbets,"The multiples/ratios indicate that Dick's is more undervalued and has more potential growth to meet fair value than ASO.

however I do see the case for ASO and its potential upside, guess we will have to wait and see"
2021-06-23 17:10:27,wallstreetbets,For real!!
2021-06-23 19:47:36,wallstreetbets,I get it.  Nice job.
2021-06-23 17:38:25,wallstreetbets,If Dicks grows it would be Biggus Dickus.  And that ASO would have nothing to giggle ü§≠about.
2021-06-23 17:14:36,wallstreetbets,Both will be successful in the next few months. I just got back from Colorado.  Wow.  Everyone is flocking to the outdoors.  Aso also has guns and ammo.  Never hurts. :)
2021-06-23 17:15:50,wallstreetbets,Aso doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúpotential upside‚Äù. It only has upside.  Just look at the chart.
2021-06-23 19:47:06,wallstreetbets,"Is that why ASO is getting attention, because of guns?  Maybe I need to read the DD?"
2021-06-23 19:59:00,wallstreetbets,Just a benefit.

2021-06-23 16:57:19,wallstreetbets,I just have watch lists built with all the major movers. I just flip through them every so often during the day. Caught it by chance and grabbed 10 $43c at $0.24 and sold at $0.55 .
2021-06-23 18:43:46,wallstreetbets,I don't think the need drove the spike.  Check the large trade at that time.  It was something like 4 million shares.  A trade that large was planned.

2021-06-23 16:22:20,wallstreetbets,">If the price decreases below $87.75, I will exit my position and look for a re-entrance at the $78.33 level, and potentially even the $67.67 level if the prices dipped this much.

Post your positions or ban"
2021-06-23 16:45:52,wallstreetbets,I've never in my life seen Monster offered in a restaurant. Somehow I doubt reopening restaurants will have an impact on this company.
2021-06-23 16:47:20,wallstreetbets,You lost me after your first point about restaurant sales. Kyle and Chad are sipping Bud Latte's at wings night. Not monster.
2021-06-23 17:13:57,wallstreetbets,"Monster is sold in gas stations, moron"
2021-06-23 16:18:17,wallstreetbets,$90+ a share is a pretty big barrier to entry. I‚Äôll pass this one to the üê≥.
2021-06-23 16:38:39,wallstreetbets,Lol so you think restaurants are all of a sudden going to start selling monster energy drinks. What is wrong with your brain? Because it sounds like you are using restaurants re-opening as to why monster is going to do better.  If a restaurant ever offered me a trashy ass Monster energy drink with my manicotti I would walk out the door and never return. That is a new level of garbage person that would order a monster at dinner.
2021-06-23 16:36:10,wallstreetbets,Don't think I'll go into Monster but this is a decent DD.
2021-06-23 16:22:41,wallstreetbets,"so tldr Monster makes more money with less assets than other soft drink companies? I mean that could well be that the company is less scaled than coke and friends, because I don't know how popular Monster is internationally outside of US/Europe yet. So assets aren't needed for shipping everywhere and supporting large ops


With that said OP may be right that Monster could be an overlooked COVID rebound, in that at the very least Monster has had an enormous presence in esports and the pandemic ending will bring back massive in-person events and revitalization of gaming centers. so, could see analysts predictions coming true if reopening proceeds normally. Personally I like Red Bull but it doesn't have public shares and Monster's price is on a big dip today so it could be a decent opportunity and timing."
2021-06-23 16:43:27,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm pretty bullish on MNST. No debt, a ton of cash, and new flavors that should help increase their already solid double digit growth."
2021-06-23 19:54:27,wallstreetbets,Did you know that Coca\~Cola owns Monster?
2021-06-23 16:29:45,wallstreetbets,"I personally like monster energy, but their brand recognition has been falling a bit over the last few years.  Maybe if this one had movement behind it first."
2021-06-23 16:46:42,wallstreetbets,"Well, the Olive Garden might not ever be successful with energy drinks bc they sell shit like manicotti. Burger King and McDonalds, however, dont serve manicotti, and their blue collar target audience would probably purchase energy drinks with their food more so than a family looking to wine and dine."

So 60 dollars at 6 dollars an option that's 10 contracts if the MOAC happens boom you just made over 100k on 60 dollars. Trust me you've spent 60 dollars on way more useless shit.

O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?  
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;  
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave  
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

Diversify your portfolio. Then hedge your positions. Then hedge your hedges. Then hedge your hedge hedges with iron condors. Then set stop limits. Then get confused and close out your original positions but hold everything else. Then get greedy and keep changing your stop limits. Look away from your trading app for five minutes and come back to see your option price blew past your stop loss limit and didn‚Äôt trigger. Panic sell your losing option and buy into the opposite security to try and capture some of the momentum. Fat finger purchase 14 contracts instead of 1. Lose $1,000 instantly as the original position you sold reverses and rallies to all time highs. Diamond hands until zero.

2021-06-23 17:14:31,wallstreetbets,I aint selling till I turn a profit. One way or another my minimum is going to be 30% I don't care if I have to bag hold this b**** until I retire. I'm on a cash account using money that I have saved from quiting smoking a few years ago. So either way the money was going to burn

2021-06-23 19:00:38,wallstreetbets,"Here is my non-exhaustive list of $WKHS catalysts: (Was deleted by mods because I didn‚Äôt get my position of 2200 shares of WKHS posted quick enough)

‚Ä¢	61% SI is absolutely insane, was highest shorted stock a week ago at 41%, was identified as a squeeze candidate at 27% two weeks ago (had 2X the SI of AMC at the time)

‚Ä¢	 WKHS Cost to Borrow jumped more than 200% yesterday. ORTEX data shows the New estimated max to short has went from 11.96% to 25.24%! It‚Äôs getting way more expensive for them to short!

‚Ä¢	Two days ago there were 400,000 shares to short, now there are reports of only 6000 (or have also seen 0)

‚Ä¢	New SEC ruling in effect today targets ending the insane levels of naked shorts, so shorts have almost no where to turn and can be margin called within 1 hour now

‚Ä¢	Owns patents for drones that launch and return to their EV delivery trucks, no one else has this tech let alone actual EV delivery trucks on the road like Workhorse

‚Ä¢	FAA drone approval this year

‚Ä¢	Over $600 million of EV truck orders

‚Ä¢	EV refrigeration prototypes

‚Ä¢	Strategic development agreement with manufacturer of current gas-powered USPS vehicles

‚Ä¢	Ramping up exponential EV truck production with Hitachi

‚Ä¢	Horsefly drone passed all 45 stringent tests that also involved humans, delivered organs

‚Ä¢	UPS now has confirmation of horsefly tech being successful and FAA compliant

‚Ä¢	IKEA continues to be spotted using workhorse trucks

‚Ä¢	Institutional ownership continues to increase

‚Ä¢	Debt free, $250 Million cash on hand

Not investment advice. Please continue to research for due diligence. This is merely info I have run across on this and a couple of other sites."

2021-06-23 17:57:27,wallstreetbets,Have shares but it's not the USPS contract that's the problem (although unfortunate). They could already have other partnerships but they haven't dealt with their production issues. If they worry to much about missing the contract and dealing with lawsuit bs and miss production goals the big ICE vehicle manufactures are going to catch up on designs and muscle them out with superior production infrastructure.

Their sales is bullshit of some guy jerking off another at a business dinner getting drunk and saying yeah maybe we'll buy it if your company ever makes shit. Said 4 years ago BTW. LOL. They're in bed with lordstown which is going bankrupt. Hilarious the bagholders around here.
2021-06-23 16:24:52,wallstreetbets,I like my odds with AMC and CLOV more but I've considered it
2021-06-23 17:53:11,wallstreetbets,"GOEV has a higher utilization (99.97%, unbelievable), and borrowing rate is also higher at 27%. The difference between GOEV and WKHS is that GOEV is not a dying company.

GOEV recently partnered with VDL Nedcar to build their first vehicle, and in parallel building their own factory in Oklahoma utilizing a $300m incentive package from the State of Oklahoma.

WKHS had 10+ years to prove themselves, but it‚Äôs been a pretty big failure. Anything Steve Burns touches is cancer. WKHS attempt to sue the USPS is their last Hail Mary before they close. Some of us make more money in our day jobs than WKHS generates in revenue. Why would the USPS award them the contract when they couldn‚Äôt even a build a vehicle that has functioning brakes? Furthermore, there‚Äôs no way WKHS could scale to the volumes USPS needs.

I hate shorts, but this short report from last year came absolutely true.

They're running out of money, and if they don't figure something out soon, they'll run out before they get to production.  Then, they'll likely have production issues with scaling, like Tesla did.

On top of that, they recently admitted that they overstated the pre-orders, and the CEO stepped down...

2021-06-23 18:09:52,wallstreetbets,"First, they are not running out of money, they have enough money to fund production through May 2022.  The plan was to have enough funds till June 2022, but they had a crappy CFO Burns brought in, who screwed up and made a mistake.  That mistake was caught when the SEC required all the SPAC's to recalculate the warrants from their mergers.  That is why the initial 10k did not have the ""going concern"" (they thought they had 12 months of capital) and the amended 10k did have it (post mistake correction only 11 months of capital).  


A ""going concern"" is required when a company does not have enough capital to continue for 12 months.  Because of the mistake made by the CFO they only had enough capital for 11 months not 12, so they were legally required to include the ""going concern"" statement.  The crappy CFO was fired.  Burns was responsible for bringing him in (from Workhorse) so he took responsibility and left too.  


The report from the independent investigation company hired by the board did not say pre-orders were overstated, it said that a small number of them should not have been taken seriously.  The fact is that they are only looking to produce 22k in the first two years, any more than that is not required.  Rich Schmidt said that they went back a reconfirmed with larger fleets and were assured more than enough were still serious.  


The ""binding orders"" crap is just that - CRAP!  No company goes to potential customers as asks ""Would you be interested in buying our product?"" and if they say yes, forces them to sign a contract that legally requires them to buy it.  It's a ridiculous ""gotcha"" that was used to tank the stock."

2021-06-23 17:41:39,wallstreetbets,I've heard of them before. In.
2021-06-23 15:22:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm skeptical of earnings plays. Stocks can smash earnings and still crater or vise versa.

But in general, I think things should look good for any car retailer right now. Used car prices are through the roof."
2021-06-23 16:57:48,wallstreetbets,"Let me start by saying ive been a car dealer for many years now and i am across the street from a carmax..

They get literally 50-100 ppl a day in there selling cars to them (i try to outbid them on their offers)

They make so much money on their auctions, dealers pay stupid prices for their not even great cars at those auctions. They probably make more money in the auction.

They have been paying highhhhh dollar lately with this insane car market, BUT recently i noticed it is not as much maybe because they know it is about to make a turn. 

Car dealerships dont usually do as well in Q3 so we are going to be into a slow season soon.

&#x200B;

Their lot is now full before there was not any cars

&#x200B;

So I would compare them to Carvana how they blew up in the pandemic peak but now are easing down, regardless they are an unstoppable company that is only growing and getting better.

There is not much more upside to what has happened so is it priced in right now?

&#x200B;

Carmax>Carvana"
2021-06-23 15:55:14,wallstreetbets,"This is DD is Late unless you are recommending puts.

Also comparing carmax to carvana is like comparing yellow cab co to uber.

I suppose we'll find out soon."
2021-06-23 16:36:40,wallstreetbets,Been in KMX for months now. It's less than stellar. I've made more money selling covered called than anything else.

2021-06-23 18:16:54,wallstreetbets,"""Used Car sales are at an all time high thanks to the chip shortage.   
CarMax is the largest used car dealership and have significantly more   
reach to acquire used vehicles for resell vs. smaller dealerships.   
CarMax is going to report HUGE earnings.""

they seem like a decent company, but this is a pretty shit reason to buy it short term, no cap. those high used car sales are no doubt priced into the expectations."
2021-06-23 19:29:24,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, what happened early MAY?  That sell off gives this play some wiggle room."
2021-06-23 19:41:47,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll buy a share!
2021-06-23 15:44:48,wallstreetbets,"I like this play, anyone who‚Äôs paying attention knows that the used car market is bananas right now. A used car bought 2 years ago will likely resell for more than the purchase price today. 

In for some 7/16 120c"
2021-06-23 15:30:03,wallstreetbets,"I think this play could make real money given the used car market. I suspect it beats projections and we see it pop a bit on Monday. Just my own projection, not legal advice for the apes. I‚Äôm in for July calls about $4k"
2021-06-23 16:42:20,wallstreetbets,"Maybe. Makes me nervous that Carmax's PPU is flat in their car resale arena. Makes me think it doesn't matter if there is a used car crunch if they flatten out their profit margins.

Meanwhile Carvana is growing every year and has a significantly higher PPU at this point.

Table created from the 2 company's 2020 10K's.

2021-06-23 18:16:33,wallstreetbets,"I looked at used car dealers earlier this year, and it's actually a good long term investment. I don't think it'll have any significant movements anytime soon.

I'm thinking discount stores. If CPI jumps again next month, then discount stores may start looking fertile for cultivation. May be wrong. Just thinking."
2021-06-23 15:08:15,wallstreetbets,Your DD might not be wrong overall but buying at earnings is just moronic. It's almost guaranteed it's going to drop
2021-06-23 17:46:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeah definitely buy at the top of a debt ridden company that has more out standing loans on the verge of default than the 08 housing crisis ... great ""play"""

2021-06-23 16:22:38,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. HAI FELLOW TARD THAT IS LOOKING ELSEWHERE BESIDES THE MEME'S. I've been doing my research on used car sales. Took a strong position in Carmax this morning. And I obviously took a strong position in $MU (their earnings is next week on the 30th). Im holding the $121 strike for July 09. When I get 100% return friday, I'm putting all that into $MU, $85 strike for August 20th. Can't go tits up!

2021-06-23 16:54:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah this guy might not be wrong. Definitely not a long or mid term play though.
2021-06-23 18:03:08,wallstreetbets,"Nice DD, bought some shares."
2021-06-23 18:15:04,wallstreetbets,Sold them a damaged F150 for $5k more than I paid for it new 6 months after I bought it. They fixed it and listed it for $3k under what they gave me for it. I‚Äôll pass on the stock.

2021-06-23 17:47:59,wallstreetbets,I bought KMX as a trade about a week ago. I believe in this play even though I typically don't play earnings. I'll stay in through the weekend depending on whether there is a run-up to Friday.
2021-06-23 18:12:30,wallstreetbets,KMX name reminds me of KBH name. Is that a red flag
2021-06-23 19:37:19,wallstreetbets,"I'm in motherfucker, my first after hours buy!"

2021-06-23 19:49:15,wallstreetbets,"KMX is a good company but last time they had their quarterly earnings announced on 4/1, it gapped down hard"
2021-06-23 19:56:01,wallstreetbets,Their commercials have gotten better over time.
2021-06-23 15:05:47,wallstreetbets,no you fucking idiot play the stocks everyone else is playing so there's consolidation/better price movement.
2021-06-23 18:02:46,wallstreetbets,"But carvana likely has much lower fixed costs. So keep that in mind when you compare the two. Haven't looked but what's the net income of each? Also carvana spends on online ads when looking for a car they're at the top of a lot of lists, CarMax spends on tv ads. I don't know just not sold on this"

2021-06-23 19:48:01,wallstreetbets,So I should buy more CLOV then got it
2021-06-23 18:56:41,wallstreetbets,I just wait and if it dips after earnings I buy then and flip when I'm up 5%. The market is fucking stupid and a company can announce they bred geese that shit gold and their stock will still dive after an earnings call.
2021-06-23 16:47:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this is a casino. Close your eyes and pick a call or a put ü§°"
2021-06-23 19:56:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, KBH took a big hit today, a great example."
2021-06-23 18:48:43,wallstreetbets,I'm in Canada and have never heard of carvana. I've known if Carmax for years. Can't comment on anything else but Carmax definitely has better branding.
2021-06-23 16:53:39,wallstreetbets,"What makes you think puts are the play here?

A stock jump seems resonable given the market and previous trading history of the stock."
2021-06-23 19:40:07,wallstreetbets,"I bought shares, that‚Äôs what happened"
2021-06-23 15:58:19,wallstreetbets,when I was getting my car fixed at the shop the worker there told me that people are buying out cars over the phone before even seeing them in person
2021-06-23 16:36:55,wallstreetbets,"I have had some offers on my 189,000 mile ten year old small Chevrolet truck that I think are insane. I was bored looking at the new Rangers and they offered to buy my truck for $5k right there even if I didn't buy a vehicle. It can't be worth that much."
2021-06-23 15:24:54,wallstreetbets,"Ehhh sometimes. Some earnings fucking crush it. I got in before Adobe posted earnings. I made out like a fucking BANDIT. You‚Äôd think I was a god tier trader, just because I bought in prior to earnings being posted after hours. If it doesn‚Äôt work for you, that‚Äôs fine. But it‚Äôs wrong to say it doesn‚Äôt work at all."

Listen. From all the recent videos I've seen, they aren't lowballing anymore because of the car chip shortages.

In this vid, very recent, dude bought an older 350Z for $4K, Carmax offered him $7,500. BUSINESS IS BOOMING."

2021-06-23 19:31:17,wallstreetbets,It more than saved their ass. They're a real competitor now. (I specialize in auto dealerships). I hope it smooths out but with the shortage of new units I think this may carry through the end of the year.

2021-06-23 14:38:26,wallstreetbets,Another book?  Just post a statement of what we can get from the encyclopedia you posted.
2021-06-23 19:40:51,wallstreetbets,They only make money off government contracts where the employees are too lazy to develop their own tools. Palantir isn't the next google lol. It's a healthy tech company trading at a really high P/E multiple relative to its growth potential IMHO.
2021-06-23 16:47:19,wallstreetbets,Nice man. I assume U mean 1500 shares with 28 cost basis. Good luck :)
2021-06-23 16:18:03,wallstreetbets,Well there revenue doubled in 2 years but unfortunately (Or fortunately depending how you see things) R&D doubled in 2 years. Not to mention all the costs associated with becoming public hurt 2020. They made their first adjusted gross profit last quarter. But Idk if they're ready to slow down and collect the cash flows or they still wanna reinvest every dollar back in to expansion. They talk about the Amazon strategy very often and how effective it is in being able to expand and capture market share while simultaneously being able to receive tax credits for not technically receiving profit because it all goes back into the company. It puts money in the Assets column and not the EPS on a balance sheet. This Slight of Hand allows them to avoid taxes and lets the company use the money for future use rather than give to investors. This is a huge turn off to short term investors but that is another thing Palantir wants to avoid is the short term mindset of Wallstreet
2021-06-23 19:34:05,wallstreetbets,"Billions of dollars have been invested into the top talent, research and development of the software. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs anticipated to explode. 

Once they continue to land more contracts, they will scale their revenue up to crazy numbers. A large portion of the overhead is taken care of once you have a polished software."
2021-06-23 16:18:41,wallstreetbets,Who gives a fuck about profit? Do you know how long it took Amazon to make a profit? Profit is for boomer businesses that aren‚Äôt concerned with growth.
2021-06-23 16:54:03,wallstreetbets,Because sales are doubling every 2 years. Basically if they can keep this pace then the P/S ratio (If price is the same) in 2023 would be 20 and then 10 in 2025. but the chances that the price wouldnt move in that time are very slim but if it doesnt move that'd be a much better price ratio for sure.
2021-06-23 15:04:51,wallstreetbets,you've never bought options before? no one knows what palantir does but who cares? it's a good IV play though because it's been bleeding for a while. Volatile stocks don't stay flat.

2021-06-23 19:51:05,wallstreetbets,No. They make money off the customers in the scale and expand phase. Plus they have no earnings as they spend every dollar they make and therefore don't have a p/e ratio

2021-06-23 16:51:07,wallstreetbets,"Well most of their current market is relatively untapped. They have one of the highest (If not the highest) revenue in their respected field. As stated most companies that manage their data dont even usually go to outside companies to try to use theirs but instead try to build in-house data management software using their own IT workforce. Ittssss....not as good as a company who solely focuses on data management. This is why when asked about competition like Microsoft, their reply is  Microsoft isnt our competitor, our competition is our customer.

Edit: The Palantir Foundry Platform that Coca Cola used back in 2017 is probably no where near as good as the Foundry Platform we have today. Over a billion was thrown into R&D since then."
2021-06-23 17:05:52,wallstreetbets,"""Threshold of 30 percent""

Continuing to execute the guidance strategy set forth by our CEO, Alex Karp, in our year-end 2020 earnings call with regard to long-term revenue guidance, we are providing and will continue to provide revenue guidance of greater than 30% for this year and the next four years **at each earnings call**. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rodney for Q&A.

This means that if its 40 percent 1 year and 20 percent the next that they will get an average of 30 percent. This means that no matter how fast we grew in any given year we will not slow down to below 30 percent the next."

2021-06-23 17:14:46,wallstreetbets,Well I guess I'd say its justified because mainly 1. Untapped growing TAM and 2. Future Revenue growth. Buying it now is expensive if it doesn't hit these growth targets for sure. Thats why I think it's justified. But companies have missed projections for sure. Its all a risk
2021-06-23 17:32:17,wallstreetbets,I really want to own it. Just can‚Äôt pull the trigger yet.
2021-06-23 17:37:58,wallstreetbets,Don't blame you. Its grown a lot in just a month. If the macrotrend of getting back into growth stocks doesnt continue we could easily see a correction.

2021-06-23 17:35:48,wallstreetbets,"The borrow fee has actually dropped significantly since last week.  I'm not sure why you are saying that it's going up.

I have a little over 50,000 shares that I lend through Fidelity.  They pay me 60% of the fee, and give me a report each day showing how much I'm making.

2 weekends ago the rate I got was 18.5%.  It's dropped every trading day since then (on non-trading days I still get paid but the rate is locked until the next trading day).  Today my rate dipped below 11%.  This is the lowest it's been in over a month.

Currently all my shares are still lent out but I expect them to start getting returned at any time as SI continues to drop. Obviously I'm not happy about this (I was making over $250/day in interest when the rate was over 18%)"

I've been in the stock since March and it's done nothing but trade sideways. Not saying it's not going to jump up anytime soon but your reasoning doesn't make sense here"

2021-06-23 14:56:42,wallstreetbets,$14 would be fair without a short squeeze.  But you just never know.  It's more of a timing to me.  I likely won't be in the name after next week.
2021-06-23 17:47:27,wallstreetbets,"You don‚Äôt understand technicals well enough, which is why you don‚Äôt get it.  Breaking the 200 the first time was key a week or two ago.  Stocks almost always re-test the 200dMA when braking to the upside.  They can bounce right off it, or they can dip below causing a head fake.  This is where many inexperienced traders lose a lot because they sell when it drops below expecting it to not return.  Breaking back above the 200dMA and closing above it for the second time indicates the stock wants to stay above."

2021-06-23 17:55:01,wallstreetbets,"This has nothing to do with market makers.  Fidelity is a broker.

And actually that's not true;  iborrowdesk only looks at imteractive brokers inventory.  Fidelity gets data from multiple brokers and averages it to set that rate.  It's a much better indication of the whole market.  The only reason people quote the ibkr data so much is because it's the only one that's freely available.  Iborrowdesk even points out that it's only data from a single broker and should not be relied on as anything more than that.

Also I have some shares at ibkr, where I also get a daily report that shows both how much money ibkr got and hour much they paid me.  The rate does not match what they publish.  It's always lot lower.

I'm not sure exactly what the rate that they publish is supposed to represent but it is always much higher than the ""interest recieved by ibkr"" column in the report."
2021-06-23 15:05:18,wallstreetbets,Again that‚Äôs the 3000 index. Do you automatically get into the 1000 if you‚Äôre added to the 3000

2021-06-23 16:07:49,wallstreetbets,"Oh trust me. I've been around since you were shittin yellow, kid. 

Basically anyone here who wants to try and prey on Redditors makes a absolutely cringe ""DD"" on why some random stock that isn't GME or AMC is ""gonna squeeze"". 

It's not. 

AMC and GME are the only squeeze plays. Everything else is a sad attempt at tricking people and truthfully should incite a ban."
2021-06-23 17:21:50,wallstreetbets,"They don't break down the 3000 after their first original announcement.  The 3000 is all 3000 companies.  The 1000 are the largest of those 3000.  The 2000 are the remaining smaller cap.  If you're in the 3000, you have to be in either the Russell 2000, or the Russell 1000.  They were originally slotted for the Russell 1000 due to being a $15bln company."
2021-06-23 17:59:49,wallstreetbets,"They are a broker that uses a fixed set of market makers.   Either way, you can take it up with your broker if you feel you're getting shafted.  Or if you want to believe that other sites are inaccurate, then so be it.  To each their own.  You think the 0.6% rate for RKT is ""always a lot lower"" if you were to lend out RKT shares than the 0.6% rate shown?  Just using your own words."
2021-06-23 15:07:36,wallstreetbets,"When the list came out originally, it stated which ones each company goes into.  If you're in the 1000, you're automatically in the 3000.  The original list stated they were in the Russell 1000."
2021-06-23 19:26:43,wallstreetbets,These numbers are from Fintel. Official numbers are only updated every two weeks and they are typically a week or two delayed. Current SI numbers are approximations such as ORTEX based on trading activity witness since the last reported date.
2021-06-23 18:22:11,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve already linked out the inclusion download several times.  The original inclusion which stated where every company was going (russell 1000, 2000, 3000) has since been over written by the new document which generically states what companies will be in included in the Russell 3000 (which clue composed of the 1000, and 2000)."
2021-06-23 16:10:47,wallstreetbets,"Who's talking about a squeeze you retard? Also please explain to me, oh wise old one, how being in the green on a stock can be considered holding bags. I'm awaiting your eternal wisdom, being only a little child myself."
2021-06-23 17:23:04,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the reply.  Scrolled down a little further and saw your other response.  I‚Äôm balls deep in this as well.
2021-06-23 18:10:43,wallstreetbets,"The broker has the inventory of shares.  This has nothing to do with market makers.  I lend my shares to Fidelity (they are my counterparty).  They then lend these shares to other brokers or to their own clients.  Market makers are not involved in the process.  They do not need to borrow shares because they are allowed to naked short in order to make a market.

I don't own RKT; I'm talking about UWMC.  My rate (at Fidelity) was 18.5% 10 days ago and has dropped every single trading day since then; it's now under 11%.  Fidelity pays me 60% of their rate, so this corresponds to a drop from over 30% to about 18%.  18% is still high but it's a massive drop in only a week and a half.

Data providers like Ortex and S3 also show that SI has dropped in that time frame, which is usually (but not always) correlated with a drop in fee.

My point is just that the statement that the borrow fee has gone up since last week is inaccurate.   It has dropped significantly in that time."
2021-06-23 15:40:50,wallstreetbets,"No. The 2000 is the 3000 without the top 1000 in it. UWMC will be at the bottom of the 1000 and of course, in the 3000."

2021-06-23 18:19:50,wallstreetbets,And my point is that your experience isn‚Äôt accurate with extracted data on iborrowdesk.com
2021-06-23 15:43:53,wallstreetbets,"I apologize, you are correct.  Nonetheless, UWMC was listed as being included in the Russell 1000 after the 1st changes were made.  They were not in the original list, but the board pleaded their case and were added the following week."
2021-06-23 19:35:14,wallstreetbets,Why don‚Äôt you do a little work for yourself instead of asking for everyone to give you everything?
2021-06-23 16:57:22,wallstreetbets,"Ironic, you sound like a bagholder here. UWMC is the play grandpa"

2021-06-23 17:21:14,wallstreetbets,"Lol numerous executives dumping huge quantities of shares right before an Earnings Report and a defamatory short report is definitely not ""normal."" In fact, it's borderline criminal."
2021-06-23 19:19:34,wallstreetbets,400m cash means jack and shit. And there's always debt month to month. Bleeding cash even if long term liabilities are short up. You ain't mass producing expensive EV with 400m and dropping. But then that is why the SEC was informed by them they may seek bankruptcy. But having execs dump their shares isn't an indicator of solid performance I don't know what is lol

We need to have militia at all points of short attack. $RIDE is one of them, and about to explode from the Russell inclusion.  The more shares retail holds, the less shorts can buy, especially on the back of the index inclusion.  

Citadel borrowed something like $100B from tons of other institutions as a ‚Äúdo or die‚Äù scenario.  They then reallocated that capital in tons of other short plays across the entire market to make up the money lost on the big players.  If we crowd these other trades too, that is how you put the nail in the fucking coffin.  One or two stocks won‚Äôt do it.  It‚Äôs all shorted stocks.  Go look at all the FUD the media is putting out on $RIDE.  It doesn‚Äôt fucking add up.  The timing is suspect, the material is suspect, the verbiage and journalism is suspect.  This is just like the 2016 and 2020 elections. Media is fucked, and Reddit is breaking the system. 

At the end of the day, your money is your money, but we are on the same team here.  This is a war, not a single battle."

It is very much not legal, PARTICULARLY if they are privy to news that the general public is not. That's the definition of insider trading.

I'd encourage you to find other instances of \*multiple\* executives selling large chunks of their own stock at the same time. The one guy literally sold 99% of his stake...fishy as hell.

If you are genuinely concerned about making objective investing decisions I'd suggest watching Tom Nash's recent videos about LMC with a neutral, open mind. He takes the time to break down the SEC regulations and codes for insider trading and how it applies in this situation."

2021-06-23 15:41:31,wallstreetbets,Cup and handle ready for launch :)
2021-06-23 15:40:52,wallstreetbets,"Reposting my comment because it is super relevant her. The main FUD I absolutely dont get. ""RKT IS CYCLICAL."" They only talk about the negatives of the MORTGAGE company, and refuse to utter the words Fintech. RKTs building a MegaDome of finacial tools, programs, and companies, while sitting on a shit pot of money for acquisitions. Hell they structured the share class specifically for acquisitions. Let's see, we have the number one mortgage company in the us, that also is becoming a direct competitor to Zillow with RocketHome. Then we have RKT auto because they said shit what else....CAR SALES! Let's do that, oh its ALREADY HIGHLY PROFITABLE in the pre full release phase?  The most dangerous weapon a powerhouse company like this has is the cash on hand to become WHATEVER they want to be next. 

25 yrs from now ROCKET Rockets, come buy all your Rocket needs."
2021-06-23 14:24:53,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs bc of Supreme Court decision today on Fannie Mae.  I think.  Or apes.
2021-06-23 14:20:00,wallstreetbets,"Most retail investors are in around an average of $26. This is a welcome uptick, but the short sellers need to be sent packing. They‚Äôre a disgrace to humanity and all thy do is destroy businesses and markets."
2021-06-23 14:24:40,wallstreetbets,RKT is the best store of value I've ever seen. We need stocks like this during times of uncertainty.
2021-06-23 14:22:47,wallstreetbets,Fuck yes long RKT. A steal under 20
2021-06-23 17:23:52,wallstreetbets,Have been in since IPO... I do regret not getting out at 41. 16's would have been a great price point to get back in. In for the long haul... In another year this should be back to \~35
2021-06-23 19:10:54,wallstreetbets,"Waiting for this to cross 25 since few months now, have 5 calls"
2021-06-23 14:18:25,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in with 53 calls for 7/2 where the apes at
2021-06-23 14:44:19,wallstreetbets,rktards unite! shart squizzle imminent!
2021-06-23 17:57:43,wallstreetbets,RKT ran up today? Must be the exchanges got hacked.
2021-06-23 19:22:58,wallstreetbets,I think its hard to pin the initial spike on cnbc. Too much volume. I think maybe it was a short margin call. Also could be a whale positioning to pump it sometime soon. Anyways I fomod in so rocket away!
2021-06-23 17:07:02,wallstreetbets,RKT to the üåô
2021-06-23 14:29:46,wallstreetbets,Yes because of the Supreme Court ruling. UWMC chart looks identical. Except half the price per stock. Look at Revenue vs. Earnings UWMC is a WAY better buy than RKT!
2021-06-23 14:54:05,wallstreetbets,Has it already been a quarter since the last pump and dump?
2021-06-23 14:09:26,wallstreetbets,"No ü§°

Loan origination is down"
2021-06-23 16:50:00,wallstreetbets,Why's RKT's graph so flat over 5 years?
2021-06-23 16:31:04,wallstreetbets,Thanks for this after reading about it I think you‚Äôre right
2021-06-23 19:12:29,wallstreetbets,"I got in at 24, and a few days ago I put in a sell order (with several week expiration) for 25.  I was considering bumping it up to 30."
2021-06-23 14:54:35,wallstreetbets,"Yea I'm going to have to say no. I like UWMC, hell that's who my mortgage is through but no. Yes price is smaller..... But RKT now has 3 new alternative revenue sources that are all competitive in their fields. Uwmc does wholesale mortgages. 

They are both great companies but let not let love for one blind reality."
2021-06-23 16:34:40,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs a big nope üëé, rocket is spending to acquire market share and it‚Äôs working.  UWMC doesn‚Äôt even own their tech they license it"
2021-06-23 14:41:21,wallstreetbets,What's the ruling?
2021-06-23 14:58:41,wallstreetbets,"This has no impact on RKT.  There is a ton of pent up demand.  Refinance volume is also up 9% in the last 2 weeks.  10-year UST settling below 1.5% despite taper tantrum scare, 15-20 bps lower than when RKT reported earnings and mortgage rates hovering around 3% near all time historic lows"
2021-06-23 17:12:33,wallstreetbets,LOL. They IPO'd last year...
2021-06-23 19:24:44,wallstreetbets,"Anything is possible when the supply and demand has been screwed up by the short sellers.  Anybody‚Äôs guess as to the accurate current numbers, but I believe it‚Äôs around 18m shares that have been supplied and for which there is a compulsion to buy. Many divide that number by the daily average volume, but that‚Äôs BS, most of that volume is the same shares going back and forth. If they had to actually buy even 2m shares from actual investors who are actually disposing of their shares per day, the price would go to $30 in a couple of days."
2021-06-23 15:42:39,wallstreetbets,"Investors aren't entitled to profits, and that the head of the org can be shit-canned. Biden will put in a leader who wants to lower standards again for loan borrowers, increasing affordability for poor people, but also increases originations. They want to socialize the housing market as much as they can. UWMC and RKT make money on volume of originations, among other things, so this is going to be a direct correlation to their income over the next year+."
2021-06-23 16:17:51,wallstreetbets,I disagree. Good luck. Puts in Aug
2021-06-23 16:44:03,wallstreetbets,Fair enough- you too

2021-06-23 14:08:26,wallstreetbets,Still trading 44x the value of the business.. I was amazed when it rose past $80 and even more amazed at its being supported there‚Ä¶  I love the business model and the way they‚Äôre monetizing their users is simply brilliant‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm still in the fence.
2021-06-23 13:54:00,wallstreetbets,RBLX whipped down from $104 to $79 area and seems to be trying to find support on the 50 DMA.  Hmm :))
2021-06-23 13:56:41,wallstreetbets,I noticed it too.  Only up from here.
2021-06-23 14:11:06,wallstreetbets,Just bought some 7/09 at 84.50c :) I like the chart too.
2021-06-23 14:44:53,wallstreetbets,Good call !
2021-06-23 15:13:09,wallstreetbets,Ok!! I‚Äôm in too!! LFG!!
2021-06-23 14:19:42,wallstreetbets,"Yes, high PE, but a bargain compared to GameStop AMC or Tesla! LOL. I think the PE is more around 110, but some folks give it a Four Star buy review. Praying ;)"
2021-06-23 17:53:18,wallstreetbets,"There's definitely a bull case for it. Over half (!) of kids in the US under 16 have played it. Once they age into a phase of life with more disposable income, it could really take off. It's also behind other games in terms of monetization per player, so there's a lot of room for improvement there."
2021-06-23 13:59:29,wallstreetbets,Thanks!  The chart looks pretty nice if/when recent lows hold.  I've bet money on worse charts! lol
2021-06-23 14:22:54,wallstreetbets,"Me too. Added today. I first stepped in at 84.75 and took some melt down. The PF computer thinks it could go as low as 75, but I like the chart here today."
2021-06-23 16:04:58,wallstreetbets,Thanks!  Only time will tell :)

2021-06-23 17:27:36,wallstreetbets,">It's been 32 for a few months peaked in feb at its highest in 5 yrs

2021-06-23 14:01:55,wallstreetbets,Been eyeing this since feb. I try not to catch falling knives but it seems like this one already landed since feb plus crsr has solid fundamentals with a great product

2021-06-23 19:26:52,wallstreetbets,CRSR hasn‚Äôt closed under 30 since it passed 30 in its initial IPO run.

2021-06-23 14:34:10,wallstreetbets,"I think the lowest it's been is around 14 and the highest is around 50 so at least it will probably stay flat if anything....quick checking 
Credit Suisse research says - outperform
Ned Davis research - buy
Cfra opinion- strong buy
Reuters research avg rating - outperform
Morning star says nothing 
Schwab equity ratings are a d (a-f) 

So yeah may not be a bad play in the casino

Or scoop up some ETFs holding it so of it does tank you're balanced in other places"
2021-06-23 14:34:36,wallstreetbets,Ps I dont know shit about finance just what I can read
2021-06-23 19:49:15,wallstreetbets,"Geez that's what everyone is focused on?  Not maybe providing info but questioning that I said 5 yrs.  1st look at my name...I didnt spend much time researching everything about the company when it IPO'd who runs it, what the board looks like, their cash flow, cash on hand, their strategy for growing the company, 5, 10 yr outlook any of the Greeks.   I simply looked it up, clicked 5 yrs bc obviously if you look at a companies 5 year history in stock price you get a general overview of how it has done so far ( so yes 5 yr but only shows to when it IPO'd) then looked at the current price, highs and lows, what it's been doing the last few months and then looked up some references on suggestions for the company that was about it...my god people chill the f out about the 5 yr thing ...damn it's a casino anyway

Here I will apologize...

Hey guys & gals since it IPO'd the high has been blah the low blah, these references said this about it so eh fk dude by a shit ton amd I wish you the best of luck!  And my uncle touches me too but he said not to tell ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)"

2021-06-23 13:45:19,wallstreetbets,"WTF.... Cramer has never been aligned with WSB.

This is the guy who tried the kill the GME short squeeze before it began. He actually personally called the chairman of the board to pressure him into a selloff (diluting) right as the pressure was building. And then spent the whole squeeze urging people to take their profits (""take the home run, don't hold out for the grand slam"").

He's also been constantly pushing the narrative that WSB is a single colluding entity. He's in large part responsible for this new idea that WSB is a coalition that works as a team to manipulate the market.

He also wanted to pursue a lawsuit against WSB, until his lawyer told him he wouldn't be able to win a case."

2021-06-23 15:57:19,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve literally seen show when he‚Äôs both hyped up WSB and the stocks they were tracking. 

And WSB WAS a single colluding entity‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what made GME happen. After that, the person leading the charge vanished and then WSB starts chasing AMC, BB, CLOV, WKHS, and who knows how many others thus diluting their stake in any single target and making another GME unlikely to ever happen again. Also, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with colluding. None of y‚Äôall were doing any insider trading for chrissakes. 

Anyway, you‚Äôve clearly got a lot of insider info into Jim Cramer‚Äôs life, including his private phone calls and legally-protected contact with his lawyer, so please, do go on."

2021-06-23 13:45:04,wallstreetbets,Much less potential.
2021-06-23 16:22:44,wallstreetbets,"> And WSB WAS a single colluding entity‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what made GME happen.

Spoken like a retard who wasn't there before it happened...

No it was not. GME wasn't even the most popular meme-stock at the time. GME happened for many reasons - WSB was a factor, but Ryan Cohen buying in and giving the company a new direction was a bigger factor. The biggest though, was just that the stock was overshorted (103%) and instead of caving when the price started to rise, the shorts doubled down (all the way to 143%).

Lol @ the insider info on Cramer's life comment... he's literally said those things on TV/twitter. Maybe you're the one who needs to start ""paying attention""

The entire ""We like the stock!"" meme was a Cramer quote. Go watch the clip, but instead of skipping to the catch-phrase, watch it like 1-2 minutes beforehand, and you'll hear him say he asked his lawyer if anything could be done legally, and was told ""all they have to say is they like the stock""

He is NOT on your side bro. His audience is largely boomers, his friends are largely hedge fund managers and whales. If he can snag some ape viewership with an acknowledgement here and there he will, but make no mistake about where his loyalties lie."

This was a personal attack"
2021-06-23 14:33:52,wallstreetbets,"Im excited for it as well. Just some notes:

1. Final list comes out friday. It is almost certain that it will be included but not 100%. These past weeks have been preliminaries.

2. Being added to the s&p has a much greater impact than the russell. It is not comparable. But still, with such a low trading volume I hope it has a great impact.

Realistically, where do you expect the price to be by the end of next week?"
2021-06-23 14:20:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm long $UWMC shares and Aug. and Dec. calls. Shorts have actually increased to about \~18%, after dropping on that run to \~$11. I worked at a hedge fund before and traded off these. I can tell you there are some banks / hedge funds projecting a relatively large addition, relative to the float.

We won't really know what will happen until about 3:45 PM ET on Friday (there will be an indication of how many shares to buy on close). On Monday, we should see some wild moves (this is my best guess).

Keep your eyes peeled, cause some of the best moves for the Russell Reconstitution are those that fly under the radar ($UWMC has flown under the radar for months)."

OP: Seeing as you are knowledgeable on this stock, do you have any insights as to what caused the huge surge in price two weeks ago?  For about 3 days straight, I believe 6/11-6/14 we had massive pre-market and after hours activity that caused rapid price movements from between $10.00-$10.80, then during regular trading hours volume would taper off and the stock would stagnate until AH/PM the next day.  I don't understand what causes that sort of movement and why a stock with so much hype, positive catalysts, price movement, would then literally shit out and drop to sub 9's for again, no apparent reason.  Thoughts?"
2021-06-23 13:35:46,wallstreetbets,I've got about 20% of my portfolio in UWMC. Been sitting on it waiting for a couple of weeks now. Hope it pops on Friday
2021-06-23 14:55:32,wallstreetbets,"Just to be clear and show the flaw in OPs thinking here. The funds that track the Russell 1,000 would need to buy up shares.... BUT (and this is a big BUT) they don‚Äôt have to do it all on one day nor do they have to wait for the stock to be added. 

OP and others even admit ‚ÄúWall Street has been trying to convince you this stock is crashing to the ground.‚Äù Now why would they be trying to do that? In my opinion it‚Äôs because (and this comes from looking at volume and other factors) the indexes that the funds that will need to buy shares upon the inclusion to the Russell have ALREADY bought shares by keeping the price low and slowly acquiring them. 

So if you are buying this stock bc you think it will balloon from $10 to $100 a share upon inclusion you are retarded. If you are buying it because it gives a decent dividend and has good business and might net you a 10% return then it‚Äôs a solid buy. 

People claimed the same stuff since the SPAC that this would balloon and that never came close to materialize. Personally I‚Äôm still sitting on ~500 shares of UMWC"

UWMC will legitimately be one of the smallest owned stocks in the entire index. When the inclusion was announced I looked at the current Russell components and UWMC would‚Äôve been in the bottom 10 (so the 990-1000th heaviest weighted stock)

That‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt see a huge jump when it‚Äôs inclusion was announced. Comparing it to TSLA and YHOO getting added to the S&P is wildly misleading"

2021-06-23 14:18:50,wallstreetbets,"Funds that track the Russell 1,000 would certainly need to buy up shares but they don‚Äôt have to do it all on one day nor do they have to wait for the stock to be added.

None of the funds would be able to get the stock mix correct because the price would sky rocket.

All that being said, there will definitely be some buying pressure over the next little while. How much remains to be seen.

Edit: so I have yet to see any confirmation that UWMC will be included in the indexes. After doing some DD of my own I found that a requirement for inclusion in the index is for public shareholders to have a minimum of 5% of the voting power. Unfortunately, that is not the case for UWMC as every share of Class D stock is worth 10 votes (1,502,069,787 shares outstanding) while Class A stock is only worth 1 vote (103,104,205 shares outstanding).

>However they have to buy in waves and not give an impression that they are loading.

People (on WSB especially) are always personifying Wall Street as if it's this hive mind organism acting consciously to screw over the retail investor.  I just don't think this is how it functions.

Why would Wall Street want to avoid giving the impression that they are loading?  What benefit would that give them?  The only inherent benefit I can see is that it would avoid letting the secret out about the quality stock that is UWMC and help to keep the price point down so they can keep buying at a low price.  However, you've already refuted this point yourself when you said:

>UWMC is a good, cash flow positive, dividend paying stock. **Everyone on Wall Street knows this.**

I hope you see I am genuinely curious and not trying to argue with you, kind of hard to convey on Reddit tbh."

2021-06-23 15:23:35,wallstreetbets,"The share price went up today specifically because of the supreme court ruling. That ruling lessons the requirements for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to BUY loan originations from UWMC. UWMC doesn't take any risk in holding the note from a lower standard loan, it's the federal government that takes the risk. Biden, socialism, lower standards for citizens, it's all in the agenda. UWMC is just the front man that benefits from the additional low-risk origination and passes that risk on to the government or other institutions that will buy the loan.

&#x200B;

What you said is not incorrect, but we saw it before, the government will just bail out entire industries, entire economies, at the debasement of their own currency. As long as the $ is the world reserve, it can do whatever the fuck it wants. Will it last forever? Who cares, get rich off it now."

A cursory search for indexes that track the R1K suggest there may be something like $30B in in control of those funds. Factor in the weighting in the index and the current share price and they will have to buy... [abacus sliding noises]... 64,000 shares, or about 39 minutes of trading volume on an average day. There may be more funds that track the R3K I suppose so let's be generous and say 200,000 shares are purchased total. That's... not going to move the stock price more than a few cents."

You will pack quietly and go the nearby town and buy the lambo. By the time your neighbours realize you bought the lambo, the demand will surge and the price of lambo in the nearby town is bound to go up until there are no lambos left. The end."
2021-06-23 15:47:40,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street is a hive mind, and if you're a bee in that hive you are actively working to screw over other bees from other hives.  You don't want some other beehive to see you are loading up from pollen from delicious orange blossoms,  fuck that, those orange blossoms are for you and your homies. 

Thusly, you keep a price suppressed on something good and slowly load your portfolio with it at the cheap price, and then remove your pressure when a catalyst comes along.  When it hits your price objective you sell while it's up and you do it nice and slow to milk it for what it's worth.  Rinse and repeat.  Market manipulation isn't always as brazen as a pump and dump,  but it's pretty much always there.  Did you not watch the old school Cramer video?"
2021-06-23 14:19:23,wallstreetbets,Russell literally puts out weekly updates on inclusions and exclusions. It's confirmed they are being added. By Russell.
2021-06-23 14:16:55,wallstreetbets,"The rules are strict around pumping your own stock. Russell told us everything we need to know. No need for UWMC to repeat.

2021-06-23 15:21:20,wallstreetbets,I sold those puts. Hence -10 to indicate negative quantity.

2021-06-23 15:21:00,wallstreetbets,"I believe he sold puts, which would be bullish?"
2021-06-23 15:16:48,wallstreetbets,"I suppose he sold the puts to get assigned and buy more stock on that strike.

Is like buying the call, but receiving the premium instead of paying it."
2021-06-23 15:03:10,wallstreetbets,"I read 2,000,000 shares but I agree with your point. I'm not expecting a major squeeze, only increase in the demand and general interest in the stock.

2021-06-23 18:33:12,wallstreetbets,"But keep in mind that because this is the low end of Russell 1000 market cap ($15b vs some $400b average), the effect of inclusion to the cap-weighted 1000 index will be small."
2021-06-23 13:49:35,wallstreetbets,"So in other words, theres not gonna be a massive, last minute buy in tomorrow/Friday?

They buy after inclusion. *Not* before.

Thanks for answering by the way. I know I'm asking a noob question."
2021-06-23 13:54:26,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha. That was super clear. Thanks. 

Cuz that's exactly what I'm wanting to do. Buy some calls for a few different Russell addition companies. And I didn't wanna throw away my money buying with Friday expiry if they won't pop til next week.


If you don't mind me troubling you for one more bit of information, do they have any kind of time limit for when they have to buy? In other words, do they have to buy up new shares very quickly? Or can it be spread across a couple weeks?

What I'm getting is, cuz this is my first year playing this type of thing, is there an automatic pop come Monday no matter what? That seems crazy to just *know* a pop is coming. So I am questioning if I understand correctly"
2021-06-23 13:51:07,wallstreetbets,Any thoughts on $GOEV?
2021-06-23 17:08:11,wallstreetbets,"I see your point.  But like you said in your last post:

>UWMC is a good, cash flow positive, dividend paying stock. Everyone on Wall Street knows this.

So using your Lambo example, if everyone on Wall Street already knows about the Lambo sale (aka UWMC stock) shouldn't the demand be surging the price into oblivion?"
2021-06-23 14:52:50,wallstreetbets,I see it‚Äôs being added to the 3000 but see no data on the 1000. Do you have a link?

2021-06-23 15:33:37,wallstreetbets,"Yes they have a math error in that they didn't account for the fact that the weighted value is based on public float, not total market cap. Being included is never a bad thing, though, because for the next 365 days, the shares bought by the ETFs will be diamond handed."
2021-06-23 17:35:52,wallstreetbets,"Hmmmm so take my $9.45 shares, buy more before Friday to average down and reap the benefits of the coming days?! I can damn sure do that!"
2021-06-23 19:42:28,wallstreetbets,Russell 3000 is Russell 1000 plus Russel 2000. If UWMC is in the Russell 3000 it has to be in either the 1000 or 2000.
2021-06-23 19:36:40,wallstreetbets,"It should still be top 500 obviously not going to touch Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc but it will be up higher than you think"
2021-06-23 14:03:22,wallstreetbets,Correct.
2021-06-23 14:25:44,wallstreetbets,"I actually do not know how long the indexes have to buy shares. I hope someone corrects me if I am wrong, but I would think 1 month dated calls from the date of inclusion would be more than enough room to make sure you're in when the buying happens. This is largely what I will be doing, because I've been burned far too many times by FDs and won't touch them anymore."
2021-06-23 14:18:35,wallstreetbets,Not a fan of ugly looking vans. Sorry.
2021-06-23 15:00:15,wallstreetbets,"That hasn't been released yet. Which index it goes into is determined by total market cap on the day the initial list is compiled. For UWMC, it's something like $12B which is comfortably in the middle of the R1K. But the weighting within the index is based on the public float. For UWMC, it's merely 103M shares or about the same public market cap as #998."
2021-06-23 15:46:57,wallstreetbets,Good points.
2021-06-23 18:39:47,wallstreetbets,Looks like it's at $9.45 already in after hours
2021-06-23 19:39:05,wallstreetbets,"No, it's going to be a *lot* lower than you think:

Basically, don't expect the index funds themselves buying the stock to drive price movement. If you're going to play it understand you're trying to count on popular sentiment and hype."
2021-06-23 14:05:38,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha :) thanks. So am I missing something or is there just a guaranteed pop for the Russell inclusion stocks come Monday?

It seems ""too good to be true"" to know for certain a pop is coming on a certain date. So I'm questioning if I understand right? Can they spread it across multiple weeks or is there just a straight up guaranteed volume spike come Monday?"
2021-06-23 14:05:23,wallstreetbets,"For anyone who made it down this far, it means dont buy for June, buy options for July onwards.

Edit: edited for clarity - was typing too fast"
2021-06-23 15:07:50,wallstreetbets,Well this is a better answer that all the links saying it‚Äôs been added to the 3000. Thank you
2021-06-23 18:46:12,wallstreetbets,"If it's doing anything like it has the past 2-3 days, I feel it'll go down pre-market and maybe a little more mid day before riding up a smidgen at end of day/after hours. Then again this is the market."
2021-06-23 19:46:16,wallstreetbets,"Number 500 has a 12.6B market cap before rebalancing, UWMC at 15B and change, it will be right where I think"
2021-06-23 14:12:53,wallstreetbets,"Nothing in life is guaranteed. All we can do is make educated guesses. If a team is included in NBA, we can assume it will lead to increase in the demand for their merchandise. Similar idea with stock and index inclusions."
2021-06-23 14:17:28,wallstreetbets,There are no weeklies on UWMC. The earliest expiry is July 16.
2021-06-23 15:35:08,wallstreetbets,It's both. The Russell 3000 is the whole index. The Russell 1000 is the top 1000 companies by market cap. The Russell 2000 is the other companies that aren't in the top 1000.
2021-06-23 19:54:10,wallstreetbets,"I doubt it, but I hope so. I freed up some cash I wanna buy more shares with"
2021-06-23 19:48:17,wallstreetbets,"Yet if you've followed my link and read the comment, it'll occupy only a very small fraction of an index fund tracking the index on a float-adjusted market cap basis."
2021-06-23 14:15:07,wallstreetbets,Fair enough :) thanks
2021-06-23 14:27:39,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Edited my reply lol - was going too fast.
2021-06-23 17:28:55,wallstreetbets,Tbh i would go for Aug 11/12c
2021-06-23 19:56:05,wallstreetbets,"I got distracted by much more interesting emojis than your words, sorry. I may be retarded but top 500 out of a thousand is not the tail end, more like the gut or chest and the stock is in a better place going forward at market close tomorrow than it is right now by being there. I like this stonk."

It scares me."
2021-06-23 13:47:16,wallstreetbets,Volkswagen EV's are pretty darned close. Bigger EU sales than tesla. Cheaper than Tesla. Not far off having autonomous driving. Decades more experience. And the share price is a lot more attractive (Elon himself admitted there should be a correction in tesla's share price). Plus Merkel has been getting some pretty good terms with China for the German auto industry.
2021-06-23 14:01:59,wallstreetbets,"Yes but why Tesla at these prices? While it‚Äôs true that Tesla dominates the market share in the EV space right now, its clear that they won‚Äôt be able to maintain it because more and more competitors are coming in taking their market share such as Ford with their EV‚Äôs and even Mercedes and Porsche.

2021-06-23 14:59:08,wallstreetbets,"I just went in yesterday to my appointment at Seaside, CA Tesla Service Center to address squeaks and rattle concerns. The Service advisor basically told me they do not warranty any of that ever. Even if you put one mile on the car, your on your own. The Service advisors name was Mr. Ken Sickler at Seaside, CA.

They had my appointment info and could have just called me to tell me this, but instead the service advisor basically made me wait a week with an appointment to drive in to tell me all the issues and concerns are something they won't address at all, ever. These are the same issues I have been working with Tesla on at other far away service centers and those far away service centers keep telling me to go to my closer one ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

How in the world does Tesla expect me to purchase another product from them if they keep refusing to fix their own defects? The guy kept saying the warranty doesn't cover it and I kept asking him to show me where it says that. He could not find it anywhere in the owners manual in the car screen after constantly telling me it was on Page 5 or 6 before and now its moved to page 8... then back tracking oh well its there on my model X. Still unable to show me any details.

HEY KEN, I'm still waiting for you to EMAIL me that warranty link you are stating that says my car is not covered for any of these issues? BMW, Porsche, Toyota, Nissan, and everyone else have taken care of my concerns on new cars... its only Tesla that is treating $80k customers like garbage. Its a stupid $20 part for a seat belt height adjustor that is rattling and they are dragging the issue on for years! 

I wouldn't want those clowns at Seaside to touch my car, the few times I have had them do stuff they screwed it up each time. Is a Tesla trained service tech a clown school??"

2021-06-23 15:09:23,wallstreetbets,"We're fucked.

Honestly, if this is how the market reacts, its not going to get much better unless there is a wholesale change in the public narrative. I don't see that happening. The public sentiment is for government to do more & punish those with capital. If there is something worthwhile to do, the government will allocate the capital. 

As you can see with the meme stonks, the market is not a capital allocation mechanism any longer. It is a policy tool.

At this point, who provides capital to another entity if they A) run this through receivership to close out legacy shareholders or B) try to recap & release them when FHFA is still the regulator.

That being said, the UST is the proud new holder of $11.0T in liabilities & $11.06T in assets as private capital is gutted.

And for these reasons, I am finishing my paperwork for the 2nd passport & will bid this land goodbye.

2021-06-23 14:07:21,wallstreetbets,"It's not just that. It's that keeping Fannie and Freddie under government conservatorship means that the Biden administration can continue to impose its favored social views via Fannie and Freddie's underwriting and loan purchase requirements.

Don't overlook that as part of this morning's ruling, the Supreme Court also held that the White House has greater constitutional authority to remove and replace the head of the Federal Housing Finance Authority (the FHFA),  than the authorizing statute purported to provide. The FHFA is the regulator (and administrator of the government conservatorship) for Fannie and Freddie.

On the heels of the Court's decision, the Biden administration announced that [it's going to replace the head of the FHFA](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-issues-mixed-ruling-on-government-seizure-of-fannie-freddie-profits-11624459222)).

>Though \[current head of the FHFA\] Mr. Calabria  pushed aggressively to end the companies‚Äô dozen years under government control, the Biden administration has signaled it would be in no rush to end the companies‚Äô so-called conservatorships. That could mean using the companies to address key policy priorities, such as closing the racial homeownership gap.

Does that sound familiar? It should.

You will recall that in the run up to the subprime crisis Barney Frank, one of the key legislators with oversight authority over Fannie and Freddie, said [""I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing.""](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/12/hey-barney-frank-the-government-did-cause-the-housing-crisis/249903/) By that, he meant he wanted the government to use its authority, through Fannie and Freddie, to force lower underwriting standards in housing finance as a means of advancing (or conforming with) preferred social views.

>\[Frank's\] most successful effort was to impose what were called ""affordable housing"" requirements on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 1992. Before that time, these two government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) had been required to buy only mortgages that institutional investors would buy--in other words, prime mortgages--**but Frank and others thought these standards made it too difficult for low income borrowers to buy homes. The affordable housing law required Fannie and Freddie to meet government quotas when they bought loans from banks and other mortgage originators.**

The Biden administration wants to try that again.

That's good news for mortgage brokers, like RKT and UWMC, because it signals that Fannie and Freddie, by weakening their underwriting and FHA qualifying loan requirements, will be used to buy up even more loans from even less creditworthy borrowers, all with the (now) explicit backstop of the Federal government. Again, from the same Atlantic article:

>It is certainly possible to find prime mortgages among borrowers below the median income, but w**hen half or more of the mortgages the GSEs bought had to be made to people below that income level, it was inevitable that underwriting standards had to decline. And they did.** By 2000, Fannie was offering no-downpayment loans. By 2002, Fannie and Freddie had bought well over $1 trillion of subprime and other low quality loans. Fannie and Freddie were by far the largest part of this effort, but the FHA, Federal Home Loan Banks, Veterans Administration and other agencies--all under congressional and HUD pressure--followed suit. This continued through the 1990s and 2000s until the housing bubble--created by all this government-backed spending--collapsed in 2007. As a result, in 2008, before the mortgage meltdown that triggered the crisis, there were 27 million subprime and other low quality mortgages in the US financial system. That was half of all mortgages. Of these, over 70% (19.2 million) were on the books of government agencies like Fannie and Freddie, so **there is no doubt that the government created the demand for these weak loans; less than 30% (7.8 million) were held or distributed by the banks, which profited from the opportunity created by the government**. When these mortgages failed in unprecedented numbers in 2008, driving down housing prices throughout the U.S., they weakened all financial institutions and caused the financial crisis."
2021-06-23 19:43:45,wallstreetbets,Also since RKT is a MLO they can keep the good loans to service and sell off the bad for thousands at a pop.  I‚Äôm not familiar with UWMC operation but great discussion!

2021-06-23 16:48:57,wallstreetbets,"There is a non zero chance for damages.

However, that slim probability is that it may be like AIG damages. So let's call it 50% chance for an AIG damages payout & 50% for a par payout. You get $25 or $0.01 or an expected value of $12.50.

If you accept this first distribution, then you can determine that the market is telling you that there 80% chance there will a decision that shareholders do not have any damages resulting in $0.00, but in the 20% chance they do decide that, there is a 50% chance it's $0.01 or $25.

Therefore,  $0 or basically $0 the market is pricing at a 90% probability. The remaining 10% is par or $25, thus the $2.50.

If you think the probabilities are wrong & you also factor in opportunity costs, you may arrive at a price where it makes sense to buy. Otherwise, at $2.50, you stand to lose $2.50 & make a 10x.

Is it worth it?

2021-06-23 14:38:36,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't talking about the purposes for which Fannie and Freddie were originally authorized. The policies they were created to advance and the means by which they were authorized to do so in 1938 are not in dispute. As a matter of policy, whether any of that was necessary or a good idea in 1938 is orthogonal to evaluating those same questions today.

It suffices to say that the secondary market for home mortgages in the US has changed a bit over the last 80 years."
2021-06-23 18:48:47,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-23 15:44:33,wallstreetbets,"Indeed. And yet they‚Äôve had an implicit government guarantee since 1968. They‚Äôve had government assurances since post 2008. 

I think, since housing costs have increased faster than most other costs, you could say their need is greater than ever. And, since secondary mortgage markets have changed so much in the last 80 years, people interested in exposure to this market should go to the private market. 

I‚Äôm sure you would prefer to ignore the reasons and benefits for which these entities were created, but we‚Äôre facing a similar housing issue today as we did in the interwar years. It is similar to saying, ‚Äúwell, we‚Äôve had low interest rates for the last 13 years, who does the Fed think they are intervening in full employment and price stability?‚Äù

NB- this is my issue with most conservative philosophy. If people want to go back to how it was, let‚Äôs go back to the FDR days when these entities were originally created. No? How about when they were expanded under Truman? No? How about when they were rescued from insolvency by the treasury? No?

>  
>I‚Äôm sure you would prefer to ignore the reasons and benefits for which these entities were created, but we‚Äôre facing a similar housing issue today as we did in the interwar years.

The housing issue we face today is that, nationally, there is a shortage in the supply of housing units, of all varieties.

But Fannie and Freddie don't increase the supply of housing or make housing, itself, cheaper. They increase the supply and lower the cost of *financing* for housing. This has the predictable effect of increasing demand and, with it, underlying asset prices, for housing.

Personally, I don't think it's good economic or social policy for the government to encourage people to become excessively indebted beyond what, under a responsible underwriting standard, their income or assets can reasonably or responsibly support, particularly when the collateral for that debt is the borrower's primary residence. The notion that we should just do this anyway because ""housing costs have increased faster than most other costs"" implicitly rests on the premise that (a) home ownership, as opposed to renting (what was once termed ""an ownership society"") is, per se, a positive good; and (b) housing values will always go up (or at least won't go down). Neither of those premises are true, which is why we ended up with millions of people facing foreclosure and host of other severely deleterious financial consequences barely more than a decade ago. 

Nor is any of this is a mystery. Lest you think I have it out for the little guy, let's look at student loans, where there is no underwriting at all. It's the same basic problem.

A supply (seats at colleges and universities) that is in short supply at growing at rates far lower than demand. Result: prices increasing (substantially) faster than inflation, making it increasingly costly (to the point of it being impossible) for average and lower-income people. But data shows that ""people with at least a bachelor's degree \[never mind what field or where they studied\] earn, on average, more than those with only a high school education!"" Desired policy: higher education is a per se good and anyone who can or wants to pursue higher education should be able to do so, regardless of cost. Solution: flood the market for higher education with (now) trillions of dollars in cheap student loans. Loan proceeds will be paid directly to universities, which have no responsibility whatsoever for either (a) educational or economic outcomes of, or (b) future repayments or defaults by, student borrowers. Consistent with both the stated policies of and their own institutions' financial interest in government-backed student loan originations, college ""financial aid"" offices (aka student loan brokerages)  tell prospective students and their co-obligor parents that higher education (never mind what or where) is the ""best investment you can make"".

Mysteriously, universities keep finding a way to spend all of this money on increasingly bloated staffs of highly paid educrat administrators (who now comfortably outnumber faculty) and luxury-styled accommodations and amenities for student residents (a personal favorite is the Texas Tech water park and lazy river). Equally mysteriously, college tuition and ""student fees"" keep rising faster than inflation. Solution: increase the annual individual borrowing cap on student loans to match! What could possibly go wrong?

Anyone who actually cares about the plight of massively overindebted student borrowers should find this arrangement appalling. If we're going to have government backed student loans at all (as opposed to a more limited pool of outright grants), the loans ought to be dischargeable in bankruptcy, just like any other debt (I could live with some limited waiting period of a few years, say 3-5, just to limit blatant gaming of the system). But they aren't dischargeable in bankruptcy because then the government wouldn't be able to garnish even the Social Security income of borrowers until they die (a practice that would land any private debt collector in jail), and would have to acknowledge the economic reality that its student loan ""assets"" are riddled with bad loans that are tantamount to grants.  

And it should go without saying that universities who receive the benefit of these loans -- whether Harvard or ITT Tech -- should have some skin in the game (I like 30%, but pick your number) for loan losses due to discharged or otherwise uncollectible student loan obligations."
2021-06-23 17:56:11,wallstreetbets,"I wholeheartedly agree with you. Which is why I think we need to move towards government supplied housing as you suggest. 

Individuals can‚Äôt make the necessary investments so government must. If the citizenry doesn‚Äôt have a place to live that can cause problematic social issues. Lack of ‚Äúownership society‚Äù decreases monetary and social engagement in a location (which you deem bad). 

The only fiscally responsible option is to provide a government option (single payer if you will) to build heaps of two bedroom housing. If bigger or different housing is demanded, the private sector will provide for it. Otherwise, mass government built housing is the most cost effective and best way."
2021-06-23 19:53:49,wallstreetbets,"We could even come up with a really sexy name for this low-cost government housing, maybe something like Khrushchyovka."
2021-06-23 19:41:16,wallstreetbets,Those are your words and ideas; they are neither mine nor fairly implied by anything I said.

2021-06-23 12:22:31,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been in AMD for awhile now and it‚Äôs been one of my favorite stocks.
2021-06-23 12:17:53,wallstreetbets,I love this stock!
2021-06-23 12:28:36,wallstreetbets,AMD is kicking ass! No brainerüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
2021-06-23 12:45:31,wallstreetbets,"Love this play $AMD, and can't wait till the xilinx deal goes through...watch it soar!!!"
2021-06-23 12:24:46,wallstreetbets,"I have about 1100 sitting on this one with an avg cost of $77.91. Still wondering why this one hasn‚Äôt broken past $100 yet considering their hardware is all over the console industry. The recent deals they have made should sweeten them up too. Not a fan of ATI GPUs, but scalper bots are pushing people away from Nvidia to them. That one is going to be a pig on LSD, who knows where it‚Äôs going."
2021-06-23 14:17:01,wallstreetbets,"If the XILNX acquisition is approved, I'm of the belief that the stock to pop upwards. If it's denied, it will go the other way. FSR is cool tech that came out, but it's a bit underwhelming compared to the competition. AMD needs a major win that'll catalyze it's current position.

Some more news about X3D cache, Zen4 leaks that suggests an evolutionary shift in design and performance, >!concrete and visual leaks about chiplets based RDNA3.!<."
2021-06-23 17:24:34,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this TA, I‚Äôm in for a small 12 shares but I like the potential with the incoming merger and this breakout."

2021-06-23 12:20:15,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 1 hour
2021-06-23 12:55:10,wallstreetbets,tbh might be why it chops sideways forever - we probably see that around the breakout usually technicals are a tell for news
2021-06-23 14:35:52,wallstreetbets,"Everyone is rattling of chart analysis but it's trading sideways because the merger with xlnx is a pure share acquisition. There was a detailed DD on this sub for it but the fast version is the hedges short the company acquiring, then they buy the company being acquired. 

This causes AMD to go down (or in this cause sideways because of strong support). Once the merger is through a significant source of selling pressure will be lifted."
2021-06-23 13:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Generally sideways because supply constraints. AMD is in great growth position, but has yet to truly capitalize on the opportunity. Market knows it. Every good news report ends up in selloff. Need to see support over 73 for a change."
2021-06-23 12:27:34,wallstreetbets,"well if you zoom out a bit this thing went from $4 to $100 in about 4 years

2021-06-23 14:40:14,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the most direct answer I have seen yet. I am well aware I have my homework to do on all the terms, to include some of what you said. That is on me to figure out and read, but I gotta thank you for answering the ask."
2021-06-23 16:09:53,wallstreetbets,"I mean you could look at it like that - but to someone who looks at charts only its just textbook consolidation

Stock went from $4 to $100 in a few years - consolidating for a year straight is totally reasonable"
2021-06-23 12:33:02,wallstreetbets,"I wasn‚Äôt really clear on my meaning with the last post. Their current value is a bit more than 50% above intel, but they do a lot more than CPU production. Nvidia in contrast is at $764 at time of post. AMD also has GPUs, albeit less popular. The hardware they offer is certainly undervalued in its present state. I was simply curious as to what some of the underlying factors are, outside of Nvidia spanking them in the GPU dept."
2021-06-23 13:39:30,wallstreetbets,"Wow, you really just compared stock prices and came to those BS conclusions? Do you even know what market cap is?"
2021-06-23 13:58:17,wallstreetbets,"I clearly don‚Äôt, as the last sentence in my previous post is asking what the underlying factors are. I understand that in WSB you feel the need to be a dick about it and thank you for bringing up the market cap.

Edit: off to go read more of this on my own."
2021-06-23 13:46:43,wallstreetbets,"I second this, Intel is valued 2x of AMD. Share price means nothing without market cap."

2021-06-23 17:42:59,wallstreetbets,"It's simple. Two companies each valued at 1000usd give out stocks. One company decides to hand out 2 stocks at 500. The other one chooses to hand out 10 stocks at 100.

Both companies are valued exactly the same but comparing the stock price is no indicator for their value."

2021-06-23 12:31:46,wallstreetbets,"Oil is up, Nat gas is up, and the only reason the stock is right below $11.00 is because last week a major short took it down to around 10.50, and it quickly rebounded, and people wrote a ton of 11 calls when it hit 10.50, so theyre trying to hold it under 11.00 through friday, but it is very undervalued and has room to run if shorts get taken over by EOW"

note that I haven't bought anything here and am not advocating that anyone should. Just saying that even for FDs, these are cheap and it wouldn't take much to make them a multi-bagger."
2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"So what do y'all think about investing in industries that were heavily hit by the pandemic now that the vaccines are out? So I just put about $100 or so in Carnival Cruise lines, because I feel like people are gonna be dieing to go on cruises again after being stuck at home for over a year. 

I also considered airlines, but just personal bias made me decide against it because I've yet to have a positive experience with any airline. They all suck.

I can make the market and individual stocks go up or down at will by exploiting an anomaly in price patterns. What is this anomaly, you may ask? It‚Äôs actually pretty simple: I just suck at trading. Literally every time I buy calls, the stock tanks. When I buy puts, the company has the best bull run in their entire history. I can literally force the market to go in the opposite direction of what I bet. Once I learn how to trick myself into inversing my own trades, I will be unstoppable. Also, if anyone needs anything from the store, let me know and I‚Äôll stop by on my way back from the welfare office.

Edit: for legal purposes, this is a joke. I neither advise replicating my trading strategies or inversing them. Market manipulation is bad. Don‚Äôt do it."

Whenever you press the buy or short button, it has a 75% chance of doing the exact opposite and it will never tell you what it actually chose until you diamond hand for at least 1 month. Statistically, you should make more money than you lose, but you also hedge against yourself in case you actually get lucky and pick a winner 25% of the time. The 25% also serves as a buffer to keep you making the same choices you currently do, instead of unconsciously switching the trades in your head because you know a computer will as well. GL üöÄ"

I have been working on learning options for YEARS and still have little to no clue wtf I'm doing. This is $ITUB. Huge call volume at $7 & $8 for 7/16. Is this significant? I don't know.  Any option nerds want to put your big ape brain to work?

If you stroll the option chain, the volume doesn't come close on anything else available. I just can't find anything else - news, calendar announcements, regulatory, etc etc.

Q1 Financials were awesome, with the majority of their revenue coming from royalties from Eli Lilly - now to be fair, I have no clue if these are somewhat one time in nature of they will be ongoing, but in any case, I think the platform that AbCellera has created will lead to many fruitful partnerships over the coming years. I haven't really done much DD (if any), but remember wanting to get into this back in December, but not wanting to pay the premium on the 100% run-up. I think this could be a great chance to get in at IPO prices for commons or to buy some FDs as this could pop 50%+ on any good news.

2021-06-23 12:13:57,wallstreetbets,This has my attention time for some more DD
2021-06-23 12:20:51,wallstreetbets,I jumped the gun on this one. 1000 shares @24.52. Looking to add more now that I see the $20 price.
2021-06-23 12:25:57,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs only dropped over the last year from $60 to $20. Why would it spike now?
2021-06-23 12:56:58,wallstreetbets,"FWIW this is my very first conviction buy of an individual stock after tracking the market for 10+ years and being a sissy index fund investor. I bought 400 shares yesterday and will continue to load up if this goes lower.

Abcellera could be an absolute cash cow in the future. In their model they take a royalty (eg. I think it was around 12% with Ely Lilly) for any successful drug research. They have a huge pipeline of drug discovery from partnerships with pharmaceuticals. Their patented AI based technology looks to have a high rate of success with reduced discovery time.

Royalties from Ely Lilly for their one COVID treatment was around $200M last quarter. This may be an outlier but imagine that each new treatment may bring in $100M a year in pure profit. In a bull case scenario, I could see Abcellera finding dozens, if not hundreds, of such drugs. Say 50 drugs x $100M each = $5B in revenue. With a huge growth rate I could see a revenue multiple 30x, similar to tech high fliers. That equals a $150B market cap or over $500 a share.

I could be VERY off on this bull case but the general story is solid. Call the future market cap anything from $50B - $250B+ if this investment thesis holds true. I figure that the downside on the stock might be that it might drop 50% in a worst case scenario as at the lower bounds they would simply become an acquisition target. However the upside is that we could be looking at the very first innings of a mega cap stock. Given the risk/reward profile I was very comfortable taking a speculative bet on this. I can afford to loose the money but would forever hate myself if I had a logical gut conviction on the opportunity and didn't take it. I had exactly the same regrets with Apple, Tesla, and Netflix over the past decade plus. I always thought that the valuations were too high and that I should stick with index funds. No more. I could be wrong on $ABCL but I'm not willing to take the risk.

I plan to hold for 5+ year time horizon but there could be a short term play here as well. I think the weakness in the stock is due to recent lockup expiration creating selling pressure as early insiders take some of their winnings off the table. Once that selling pressure dies down and AbCellera gets past the drop-off in their COVID treatment this stock could rocket. Most price targets are around $60 this year."

Now the news media has latched on to an alleged Billionaire space race between Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin Founder‚Äîneed I say more) and Sir Richard Branson (Virgin Galactic Founder). Both companies are pursuing space tourism and government contracts. They are nearing operational capabilities which will be topped off by a flight by their founders. 

Bezos is planning on flying 20 Jul with his brother and undisclosed $28M bidder. Rumors abound that Branson is planning on beating him. 

Blue Origin is not publicly traded , but catalysts for SPCE include next test flight which could include Branson, Italian Air Force test flight, FAA approval for tourist flights, and establishing a higher ticket price after demand signals.

2021-06-23 13:58:44,wallstreetbets,And based on the price point of Blue origin I think those ticket prices could more likely go for $500k. Upcoming flight was $600k for a researcher.

1, On  MAY 12, 2021, there is an executive order issued by the president for the zero trust cybersecurity's requirements nationwide  saying ""All Federal Information Systems should meet or exceed the standards and requirements for cybersecurity set forth in and issued pursuant to this order.""

The link as follows [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)

&#x200B;

2, Since there is a demand for the zero trust cybersecurity, guess who will pose the best opportunity to supply this?  Of course it is #BB, $BB, as "" BlackBerry has a long and rich history of partnering with industry and government organizations to help improve cybersecurity. As part of the Board of Directors of the [National Cyber Security Alliance](https://staysafeonline.org/about-us/), BlackBerry is proud to support initiatives to help consumers better protect their digital privacy.

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: Somehow we've entered into a timeline where WSB & Wall Street Analyst (usually üåà AF) can agree on WISH going to the üåö! Anaylsts PT is up to $30. My shitty Canadian exchange just launched a feature where you can see a stocks score from the perspective of analyst, the news, and retard bloggers (likely us). So this DD isn't coming from me, it's coming from SUITS and it's fucking bullish.

This is what that page looks like for our wonderful $WISH:

**Consensus**:

[Analyst consensus for is 60&#37; in favor of buying, but most notably, the üåàüêª's still say HOLD not sell.](https://preview.redd.it/z9tuvq4721771.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee2d41a1b9d2ba9e8d501a7b70916e7a1d62a60d)

**Next up on this wonderful dashboard is the the consensus price target average:**

[What's notable here is the üåàüêª average out to $18.60 PT over the next 12 months, this of course doesn't factor in that the combined retardation of WSB is focusing on it, analysts believe in \\""fundamentals\\"" and this stock has it.](https://preview.redd.it/we9trtam21771.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=09430e36caa674e96eea32c78709cd05b4c37325)

**Now here's the juicy stuff you've been waiting for Price Target per Analyst:**

[Some based fucking APEs in here. Feels like I'm reading r\/WSB DD. But yes, you read that correctly, your dumbshit YOLO on some flimsy DD you read on reddit is now being backed up by wall street.](https://preview.redd.it/65q899hh51771.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=0386059f3b341edf39a6fac81cbc571882f53e91)

As you can see reddit has stumbled on a real stock, one that has those mystical *fundamentals* they keep mentioning on CNBC.

**TL;DR:** Bullish AF.  I'm not sure how we entered into this timeline but now that this stock has the full focus of WSB+WS I feel that Marvel can step the fuck back because THIS is now the greatest crossover in history.

to mods: I hereby propose the word *fundamentals* should always be italicized on this sub or the commenter/poster gets banned.

to visualbot: fuck you this is real DD"

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH...The App and the Products... Why WISH is a ""shitty app""? Well...it¬¥s on purpose.

""In June 2007, Szulczewski transferred to Google‚Äôs new office in South Korea and got a lesson in tech outside the Silicon Valley bubble. Koreans preferred search portals that were busy and crowded with information over clean, minimalist home pages like Google‚Äôs. Former Google colleague Mark Rabkin remembers debating the point with Szulczewski when he visited. ‚ÄúI could tell he was starting to think like a local,‚Äù says Rabkin, who‚Äôs now an ad executive at Facebook. The experience would help shape Szulczewski‚Äôs strategy for Wish: He learned to focus on building something people wanted rather than what Silicon Valley thought they should want.""  


Does WISH sell shitty products?  


""Wish‚Äôs open-door policy meant that sales were taking off, but so were quality-control problems‚Äîwhich is somewhat inevitable when you have one million registered merchants, of whom 125,000 are active on Wish each month. By way of context, Amazon hosts an estimated 2.5 million active third-party merchants, while Walmart has roughly 21,000, according to Marketplace Pulse, a New York-based e-commerce intelligence firm.¬† 

To tackle this, Wish automatically culls about 8 million products over a week, or close to 3% of all products available on the site. Most are cut because visitors have scrolled past an item at least 1,000 times and haven‚Äôt tapped on it once. Wish also culls products from merchants who‚Äôve received bad reviews or put up fake reviews. To automatically detect the fakes, Wish‚Äôs engineers trained its software on reviews that were obviously made up. One example: ‚ÄúDid not expect so soon, the owner of service enthusiasm.‚Äù Now the software can identify reviews with similar nonsensical phrases.

Szulczewski seems unfazed by the quality-control challenge, pointing out that sometimes customers themselves are the problems.""We sell 5 million contact lenses a year. Someone's going to sleep in them.""Overall, there is a set of roughly 60 rules. If Wish‚Äôs algorithms see that a merchant has listed counterfeit products or shipped an order with a fake tracking number, they‚Äôll be ‚Äúfined‚Äù $500. Shipping a package with no product spells a potential $10,000 fine. Wish collects around $3 million a month in fines, and it can do that by simply withholding payments from merchants, says Szulczewski. Merchants can also get kicked off the platform, he adds. On the flip side, good reviews can lead to faster payments or a higher ranking in search.¬†

Zhang, who is 6,000 miles away, overseeing operations in three locations in China with 150 staff members, is just as paranoid about being gamed. ‚ÄúMerchants definitely care about making money first,‚Äù Zhang says. The rules and monitoring software don‚Äôt always go down well. ‚ÄúThe merchants look at Wish‚Äôs platform as very robotic,‚Äù he says, meaning there‚Äôs no way for merchants to negotiate a better deal by cultivating personal relationships with Wish staff.

¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôll never be perfect,‚Äù admits Tung, the GGV investor. ‚ÄúYou get what you pay for.‚Äù But Szulczewski paints a rosier picture. The flywheel of customer data going into Wish will mean more reviews, smarter targeting software and, eventually, better-quality items. Those unbranded smartphones will get better every year, he says, ‚Äújust like our iPhones.‚Äù¬†  


So...the future is bright! 500 stocks at 12.11$

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

NIO is up 2.3% at open and options contracts are 50% up. if u bought any contract yesterday by my recommendation u would be up by 50% now.

JPM trading sideways. 

PLTR broke $26. and options are 200% tits up, I am wrong on that. 

JMIA is up by 3% , options are 200% I am right on that. 

&#x200B;

RIDE is trading higher. So I am wrong on that. but still bearish  on this.

MNMD fall down. So wrong on that. 

AMC slightly higher. The options are high at open but lost traction overtime. 

ZM opened higher with 100% call gains. 

https://preview.redd.it/5fdwpfhzx0771.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb8ffb8149c4998d4f75fd581f172c6fef3085e6

This is my final post on this subject. Seems like Most of my prediction except PLTR is good. I have to do more research on PLTR. I hope my previous post and this post helped you. if you bought yesterday you would make 50% ROI today."

2021-06-23 17:29:39,wallstreetbets,"Holding my 47000 shares to the grave if I have to.

Is key that we get the stock above $15 from now to Friday. On Friday the call options start outweighs puts at $12 but causing maximum pain above $15. [http://maximum-pain.com/options/clov](http://maximum-pain.com/options/clov)

Above $15 our beloved shorts will need to pull 90 Million shares to cover their asses with the call options alone, then an extra 50 M to cover their naked shorts....

I know is tempting for the paper hands, but try to keep your hands in your pockets for 48 hours...just enjoy the ride.

Low IV, seemed to be on a steady rise up, options are cheap as hell. Long at the TA astrology charts it I have a feeling in a few weeks it's going to jump enough to matter. There was nearly a 5 month cooling time between the mooning of several other WSB darlings. According to the same time,  I expect PLTR to do the same in the next few weeks. 

So I basically went all in. (Though I never sold my few GME shares, just in case the messianic prophecy  comes true.)

If pLTR goes where it realistically could, I made a bet to get a tattoo of a weird banana on my ass.

Doesn‚Äôt take a genius to see why. Chip shortage is going to hurt production until October, one Ford rep says the production woes will be ‚Äúfigured out by then‚Äù which means the line should be rolling 3 months after that (if you know Ford at all then you know they‚Äôre always a quarter behind with what they say) all outstanding 2021 orders are going to stack on the 2022 product. Look at used car prices right now, soaring because companies aren‚Äôt producing. I‚Äôm in dealerships that average selling 75-120 new cars a month and they‚Äôre ripping out maybe 5-10 now because of production. Things are only going to get worse before they get better. And if the bears have their way this Fall, double whammy for an industry already bent over by Covid chip shortages.

This makes me think your DD is already priced in, and actually holding back F prices from being even higher NOW, rather than a catalyst for some big price drop in the future.

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PLYA - So you wanna be a Playa? Apes, artists and tards. I am here with what I believe to be one of the few remaining reopening/recovery plays to really take off. 

# The Roaring 2020s:

People are desperately looking to get out and go somewhere. And where would you want to go after being cooped up in the house year long? The beach of course. Thanks to the money printer, US total personal savings have almost doubled from pre-pandemic levels. You bet some of it is going to be blown on nice vacations. 

We have all witnessed how the recovery plays took off in the past few months leaving tech FD chads who had been winning last year on the breadline. Last week was not so good for these plays but many of them are still not at levels worth buying the dip.  While any recovery stock has been literally free money so far, as the boomers over at CNBC say, tHe eAsY mOnEy hAs bEeN mAdE. It is now time to pick the clear winners of the reopening. The market is bigly underestimating pent up leisure demand.

Playa Hotels & Resorts is a luxury all-inclusive oceanfront resort chain with hotels and properties in Mexico, Dominican Republic and Jamaica. They are very well run and raking in money. They are perfectly positioned to take full advantage of the deluge of tourists who will be coming in waves.

[\*insert obligatory wife's boyfriend joke\*](https://preview.redd.it/yxcf3dr0ct671.jpg?width=510&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be91356644726d4114149a8b54480cf127bc533)

# The setup:

The market is pricing $PLYA as if things will be just be going back to normal by next Jan, which is usually peak demand season for their beach resorts. However, they are going to absolutely crush the numbers from previous years as their business is picking up steam rapidly. Their average room rate is already exploding and they could be operating at peak demand from July which is unprecedented. Their June and July rates have also surpassed December recently based on data from booking.com, hotels.com etc. 

Here are some stunning trends:

[It's June and the search interest is spiking; every other peak was in Jan in prior years.](https://preview.redd.it/l10irfjs8z671.jpg?width=903&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bf74164723873c579413100a4046555a03b76c8)

[US Google search volume for beach resort is 25&#37; higher than pre-pandemic levels.](https://preview.redd.it/53kbt8ez8z671.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3608bbfa6ea96bde2ded380574fdf334b7b075f)

[ YouTube search interest for ‚Äúbeach resort‚Äù  spiking bigly.](https://preview.redd.it/ubg35ovgxz671.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=59b04a6343f81cda3d072f1564f6b3887bcb4449)

[Worldwide search interest is recovering, should give another boost to $PLYA.](https://preview.redd.it/co4hfxc4yz671.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e1dd47dec6bbd2fe0a518583e52145b561377c)

Their hotels also have some of the best reviews and ratings for a luxury resort chain in Tripadvisor, bookings.com, hotels.com etc.  They don't have properties in business locations so the uncertainty about the return of business demand does not affect them. Flight trend data (from kayak.com) also points to an increase in traffic to the locations where $PLYA has resorts.

All this without significant traffic from Europe, Canada and Asia. They have been slower to reopen compared to the US, but when they inevitably do, expect the demand to skyrocket even higher.

Unlike many recovery plays, they have pricing power. And they are going to absolutely milk this opportunity by charging top dollar. Here is what the CEO had to say about it in the last last earnings call before this crazy spike in demand. 

https://preview.redd.it/f19jeep6vy671.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e94839cee17f93b1b4d7d818084cf92b25f354a

That is a nice way of saying that they will be adopting a ""fuck you pay me"" approach to doing business when demand booms.  So they were anticipating this and planning accordingly. So far, it looks like they are going to have a  blowout quarter.

# Financials:

Not that y'all care, but they have a healthy balance sheet. They raised cash back in Jan with an underwritten public offering of shares. Cash and cash equivalents are up and debt and liabilities are down compared to the previous quarter so there is little chance of further dilution now that their resorts are starting to get packed again.

# Analyst ratings:

The average Wall Street PT sits at $7.25, totally oblivious to what is happening. But the big boys have started to take notice. Deutsche Bank has upgraded the PT from $8.00 to $10.00. Even Bank of America, which which used to have a $1.5 PT on our beloved gamestonk has initiated coverage recently with a PT of $10.00. 

# Technicals: 

I passed PLYA through u/pennyether's tried and tested SMELL system.  

* **Short Interest:** SI is currently estimated to be 7.03M shares by MarketWatch, which is about 5.5% of the float. Even though it is low (which is good news fundamentally ya apes), this is a very illiquid stock with an average volume of 1.29M shares and 5.34 days to cover. So shorts covering quickly due to the market waking up to the potential should give a nice boost to the SP.
* **Market Cap:** Market Cap is $1.23bn.
* **Extremely Memeable:** Memeable? Idk, I really like how the ticker sounds.
* **Low Liquidity:** Average volume is just 1.29M shares ($9.38M), or 0.7% of market cap. Institutional ownership is high and sits at 75.74% which makes it even more illiquid.
* **Low IV:** IV is currently at 51.64%, with the IV Percentile at 10% and an IV rank of 4.46%. So the IV currently is nearly as low as it gets for $PLYA. I have seen that many of you regularly make generous recurring weekly donations to our favorite market maker Citadel by buying overpriced FDs with IV above 200%, so here is a chance to not do that.

I don't play with crayons, but $PLYA briefly dipped to the 100-day SMA last week with JPow tanking the market and the general drubbing of the recovery plays. Expecting this short term dip to be eaten up very quickly.

Also, I am just another tard and did not come up with the trade. I shamelessly copied most of the stuff from the amazing research done by Chris Camillo (The incredibly successful social arb trader in Jack Schwager‚Äôs Unknown Market Wizards.) and friends who specifically hunt for opportunities like this. This trade has gone under the radar so far, though I suspect it shall not remain so for long.

# Bear case:

The only bear case I can think of is another COVID surge which could potentially drive down demand, but the chances of that happening in the short term is small enough to neglect imo. Even then they are less likely to be affected compared to other hotel chains as they don't have any business locations.  


# TLDR:

People are flush with cash and the pent up demand for leisure is exploding. $PLYA is perfectly  positioned to take advantage of this with their amazing all-inclusive beach resorts and the market has failed to appreciate it so far. Technicals and fundamentals point to a good entry now.

# Positions:

Commons are safe, but I am allergic to commons and playing options only. 

* Jul: $7.5C - Betting on the market realizing that Playa is going to absolutely crush it this quarter and capture the pre earning run-up.
* Aug, Sep: $7.5C - Safer calls that expire post earnings.
* Sep:$10C - A tiny handful of lottos for dIvErSiFiCaTiOn.
* Nov: $10C- I expect the market to fairly value Playa by then."

You mentioned that PLAYA was one of the few recovery plays (pardon the pun). I personally think Ashford is in a better position than PLAYA but only if corporate/business travel demand picks up.
2021-06-23 13:14:29,wallstreetbets,Its also because its probably going to be the biggest spring break year ever. And I really mean ever with the full weight of what is likely to be literally 3 or 4 million college kids.

They're about to see a huge wave of Canadian bookings and then another tailwind of European bookings.  Look at the Canadian Google Search trends.  Their costs are relatively fixed, so their margins are shooting through the roof.  This is a luxury trade on top of a recovery trade.  Upper class gained so much wealth this last year."

2021-06-23 11:30:09,wallstreetbets,"Multiple things. First they just have beach resorts that too in Mexico, Dominican Republic and Jamaica, which is seeing a lot of influx from American tourists while Europe etc is closed. They are THE premier hotel in the Dominican Republic which is trending now.  


They don't have any business locations. Business demand yet to bounce back and is doubtful which makes it a better option than most chains.  


Now, the Caribbean usually sees a lot of tourists from Europe. Once Europe opens up, they will drive demand too. Not to mention that Playa resorts have amazing reviews/ratings. All these factors come together for Playa."

2021-06-23 14:09:21,wallstreetbets,How long you reckon?
2021-06-23 12:52:06,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm on mobile so forgive typing mistakes and brevity. 

Dogshit financials are relative, I am saying dogshit historically as far as value goes imo (since most of the bulls are claiming value)

You say they were profitable pre-pandemic but to put that in to perspective, they made a combined total of 0.23/share for the entire 3-year period of 2017, 2018, and 2019 and then lost 1.69/share in 2020 and are expected to lose .94/share in 2021

You say they don‚Äôt have bad debt for revenue. Who compares debt and revenue? **they have a debt/equity ratio of 1.8** and the curve to a healthy and steadily profitable company is not steep when you look at the past 5 years...

The records I am using are from unhedged.com. 

2013: loss of .75/share

2014: loss of .97/share 

2015: loss of .79/share 

2016: loss of .47/share 

2017: gain of .10/share 

2018: gain of .14/share

2019: break even 0/share

2020: loss of 1.69/share

2021: guidance of loss of .94/share

2022: guidance of breakeven

2023: guidance of gain .17/share 

Revenue growth has been slow since 2016 and has a long way to go to catch up to pre-pandemic, EBITDA has been all over the place since 2016 as well. 

Equity growth has been underwhelming for the valuation. Liabilities keep pace with assets throughout the 7 year period except for one decent year-to-year jump. 

Not much about their history makes me want to value this company at 1b, but if you are looking for a COVID earnings pop, a wham bam thank you mam in and out go for it. 

As a side, there is a cap to what a hotel resort could post in a quarter. All rooms booked. And yes they can increase rates but they do have an inventory choke, so you need to think about earnings growth through a reasonable time perspective. Do what you will with the info ü¶ç"
2021-06-23 13:05:05,wallstreetbets,I did 2 of calls 12.5c 7/16. Burning a $20 might be more enjoyable to watch.

2021-06-23 14:52:24,wallstreetbets,Nice. Means good demand. Going to buy a bit more. Last month even it was higher. This seems safe. Lots of upside.

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$LEVI - The King of Denim üëñ After the recent inflation FUD, many retail stocks got hit hard and blue chip has been slow to recover. Enter LEVI the most recognizable and best sold denim brand in the world who got extremely oversold after reaching new highs and posting earnings that beat expectations.

Who is LEVI and why are they relevant now? I should slap you with my brand new pair of 541 jeans I just ordered if you really have to ask. They are the leading fashion company for everything denim. LEVI has been around for over 168 years as a profitable business, but only recently IPO‚Äôd in 2019. Since then LEVI shares up 53%. Throughout the pandemic they have kicked ass in building up their e-commerce platform and have worked on making their business more sustainable with their line of water-less jeans.


CEO Chip Bergh is a smart cookie üç™ (see what I did there), he managed to help LEVI‚Äôs grow 436% last year by diversifying beyond denim and selling more directly to consumer. Projected growth is 23% for next year as a conservative value, but Chip believes they are strongly positioned to come out even higher this year as the pandemic comes to an end with more people going back out to shop and spend their money on new wardrobes.

After being oversold last week, LEVI has been on a slow and steady recovery. OTM options took a big hit and are currently on freaking sale. Most price targets for end of year are around $30-32 with a high of $36 and even the most bearish analyst has $25 as their projection. That leads to me the most important section.

Positions:
Currently, holding 86 x $30c 10/15 which at time of posting is almost worth $1.00. Super fucking cheap and easy to ride for either a quick pop or all the way to expiration. Earnings are coming up on 7/6, which has already likely been priced in, but is actually still very undervalued. Delta on the call option is great, Theta is super low, Gamma is decent, and Vega could blow up the premium because IV is only 38%. Get in while you still can and go buy some jeans, you disgusting athleisure troglodyte üëñ

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My Thoughts on NIO  Hello Investors, this is not financial advice and I am doing this out of my own hobby. Please feel free to share with the other communities as well. Constructive feedbacks are welcome. Let's begin Part 1 on the analysis of vehicle delivery estimates.

I am conservative with my numbers and the CEO Li Bin is much more bullish as compared to my numbers on vehicle deliveries.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: Vehicle delivery estimates](https://preview.redd.it/79ewq9pqu0771.jpg?width=968&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=898ee4cd4ea3958dab8764cf9332f99c942178d2)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Figure 2: Chart of vehicle deliveries](https://preview.redd.it/1b4p192su0771.jpg?width=3339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f27b34cf2fc2ac08c0ac47b5f8d271e3a744d19d)

NIO commenced deliveries of their ES8, a 7-seater high-performance luxury electric SUV, in China in June 2018, and debuted the ES6, a 5-seater high-performance premium electric SUV, in December 2018. In 2018, it delivered a total of 11,348 vehicles, sending the stock price surging.

With more people becoming familiar with the NIO brand, sales of both vehicles increased, with the ES8 exceeding expectations due to the sheer luxury of the interior and attractive exterior, which outshines many other vehicles on the market in 2019. In 2019, this resulted in 20,565 deliveries. Despite the fact that the number of deliveries is substantially higher than in 2018, NIO EV sales were affected in early 2019 due to a battery recall of its vehicles. This lesson was significant for NIO because it emphasizes the necessity of battery safety practices.

Source link: [https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/nio-electric-vehicles-sales-took-a-hit-as-it-scrambled-to-handle-battery-recall/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/nio-electric-vehicles-sales-took-a-hit-as-it-scrambled-to-handle-battery-recall/)

Moving forward to 2020, with more individuals concerned about environmental protection, the Chinese government spent at least $60 billion to assist the electric-car businesses. This includes research and development, tax breaks, and battery-charging stations (NIO!!). Additionally, the government also loosen its restrictions on license plates which attracted more buyers to the market. As a result, the number of companies producing electric vehicles has increased. NIO, on the other hand, managed to distinguish out from the crowd due to its distinct value proposition. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, this resulted in a strong increase in vehicle deliveries of 43,728 in 2020.

Source Link: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/16/next-china-trade-battle-could-be-over-electric-cars/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/16/next-china-trade-battle-could-be-over-electric-cars/)

Not only that, but the demand is far outstripping the supply. Because the present facility is insufficient to fulfill demand, NIO announced the establishment of a second factory in Hefei's NeoPark. The production will begin in Q3 2022 to meet the demand for ET7 vehicles, and it is planned to provide over 1,000,000 vehicles and a 100GWh battery. (\*Note: I am really optimistic about this.) NeoPark alone is expected to generate RMB 500 billion in yearly gross output.

To conclude, my vehicle estimate is rather conservative and I believe that NIO and its CEO Li Bin will be able to deliver as many vehicles compared to my estimates. My price valuation still remains at $78 EOY and it is a conservative number. If you have any further questions, please like and comment, and the community and I will respond as soon as possible.

In this community. More ""people"" pushing WISH, a stock that is roughly 4% float shorted, over a company that's over 40% shorted... if the overall arc is to punish the shorts and make money, why the hell is ""everyone"" trying to pump WISH when there is a viable and incredibly easy target in WKHS??

I use ""people"" because I'm certain there are nefarious actors in here posting in bad faith to get their funds holding pumped. That's why WISH makes no sense, I think it's a team at work posting every day and I will uncover this conspiracy."

Sorry, but they aint running out of money soon, especially when the worst news of USPS and their Q1 results came out and they still are solid. The only way is up with them, and they really should have never been counted as down. RIDE literally said they could very well go out of business. NKLA just got listed on the exchange last year.

2021-06-23 12:53:51,wallstreetbets,"You've gotta look at alot of these users who post like OP. They could very well be someone involved in the business of marketing Wish. Ever since the name has been dropped here, it's seemed fishy. 
I personally wouldn't touch it but as I said in my last post, there's a chance money could be made. There's a Good chance, but don't expect to see what you saw with other meme stocks or something like Amazon. 

IMO, it's definitely NOT something to hold with. This IS WallStreetBets after all, so if you feel like betting some money for a chance to gain SOMEthing, then go for it. 

Nothing is a sure thing and again, I wouldn't put my money into it (especially almost 100% like OP has, which makes them suspicious), so if you do decide to, make sure it's an amount you can afford to lose.



Edit: so like the other comment said: it's the poor man's Amazon. Their products are ususually Chinese made cheap imitations of legitimate products. I've bought from them before and each item I got (except for shoes) was complete garbage that broke extremely quickly or was curved (when supposed to be straight) or out of alignment (woodworking tools I wanted to try). The metal used by them is veeeeeery cheap, hence the term ""chinesium"""

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PRPL DD - A catalyst awakens an ancient meme... # TL;DR PRPL is growing like a fucking weed, and has announced an off-cycle investor event which will take place one week from yesterday on 6/29. This, combined with a recent, inexplicable drop in share price and a pickup in traffic/sentiment has created a golden opportunity for entry into a nicely growing stock. Oh, and for cheap July calls.

Hello again fellow apes, movie theater zombies, and Taco Tuesday enthusiasts,

First let me start off by saying that this DD features some drastically conflicting emotions for me, as PRPL was one of the first stocks that every truly fucked me. Now, I can look back at my play and realize that it was a really stupid decision with almost no basis in logic, but I think we all know that I'm going to blame the big boys ""MaNiPuLaTiNg"" the ticker and hold a grudge for the next several decades.

**On the flip side of that...**

I own several Purple products and love them all. Mattresses, pillows, seat pads for office chairs, kids' mattresses; really the whole range. We have always been pleased with their customer service, the quality of the products, and the overall experience with the company.

**If you want to learn the basics of the company, there are a lot of great posts out there and some of my favorites are by** u/lurkingsince2006 **- I don't usually link profiles in my posts, but this user knows PRPL inside and out and has made huge gains off of the stock and I wanted to recognize his work here.**

# Now, on to the post... I will look at recent and upcoming PRPL activity through the lens of various detractors/complaints...

**Complaint #1: I can get a mattress just like a Purple on wish.com** **for half price.**

**Answer: Fuck you, you can't be saved.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Complaint #2: PRPL is a dead meme, boomer.**

**Answer: This is a rapidly growing machine, retard.**

[There's been an awakening.... Have you felt it?](https://preview.redd.it/6spzbbo94v671.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f476b6039d14ba49d93484282704ea0f4557f7ef)

PRPL is not dead. **Mentions on reddit are up 75%** day over day recently and there are more and more posts hitting the front pages. This stock has once again reached it's recent low point of about $25 and bounced back quicker than a dropped infant on a grid of hyper-elastic polymer (if you know, you know). Yolo posts, even one for $1 million + that I saw, are rolling in as people see the story and realize the potential.

Now normally I wouldn't put photos of a company's facilities on here, but these pictures perfectly illustrate the kind of growth that PRPL is experiencing. I won't even show you their first factory as it's only about the size of 2 super markets, *which is small compared to their others....*

This is the second factory. Massive, but doesn't even come close to keeping up with demand:

https://preview.redd.it/smcpcmu96v671.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=91a634a6b3b00fea96693b4c3aa0a2b336e9eefd

Factory 3, the first for PRPL outside of Utah, makes the others look like toys:

https://preview.redd.it/c0mgm0dj6v671.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=47fee52c3035889595a12329c9e3620d276499af

Oh, and, see that huge lot next to their current project (slated to open this year) that's pretty much the exact same size as the factory they're finishing.....? Get the idea?  Scalable innovation.

&#x200B;

**Complaint #3: This company has garbage financial performance.**

**Answer: This company** ***used to have*** **garbage financial performance.**

Trust me when I say I am familiar with 3 things..... (1) The inherent volatility of growth stocks, (2) the unpredictable nature of retail, and (3) getting burned by volatile options plays on inherently unpredictable growth and retail stocks. Fuck.

Companies in this area take time to stabilize and that's exactly what we've seen PRPL do in the last year of reporting:

https://preview.redd.it/anv1tkpf7v671.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bdba34c5e48438fa89c027da38d7144e461e138

A decent sample size where we're no longer seeing 100% missing on EPS. We're instead seeing EPS consistently beating, revenues largely in line with estimates, and profitability quarter over quarter. Quality products only matter if you can sell them and make money on them. **PRPL is selling everything they can make as fast as they can make it, and they're making money doing it.**

&#x200B;

**Complaint #4: There's nothing new coming out of PRPL.**

**Answer: A special investor event recently announced for June 29th**

This section is very short, and most of the information has already been typed above. PRPL announced a special investor event/presentation on the 29th of June. Companies do not schedule events like this when they have bad news. They also don't rush to schedule them unless it's good news; this event came out only a few days ago.

**Here's where my thinking is....**

* PRPL drops to $25 support level (done)
* PRPL bounces off support like your whale aunt on a trampoline (.....done)
* PRPL gets boost from pickup in retail stock trading traffic (in progress)
* PRPL gets boost from 6/29 investor event (TBD)
* PRPL on its way back up to fair trade value (+29-73%):

https://preview.redd.it/p87owubs8v671.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=753728ec63f2647392934a696cf963f23edbf3d8

# This gig has paid before, and it could again. This might be the kick in the ass it needed. Either way, consensus says shares pay in the mid term. Personally, I like the stock for a short bump and a long gain.

^(This is not financial advice - do you own DD and buy a god damn Purple mattress while you're at it.)

See you on the moon.

Cheers

2021-06-23 16:20:02,wallstreetbets,"Question on this if you have a chance (possibly complaint #5).

I've been looking at them myself and agree with a number of the catalysts and growth prospects. My biggest concern is the tax receivable agreement with InnoHold, which to me just basically seems like a scheme from the initial owners to siphon money back to themselves rather than the common shareholders.  The long term liability looks to be around $166M whereas they netted $20M in income this year - isn't this going to significantly cut into their earnings growth prospects?"

Read most of your posts, great stuff. Mine is simple but I like it that way. I cut out 90% of the specifics and focus on the mains. I like the stock ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."
2021-06-23 10:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Stonks aside, 100% agree. Neck pain alleviated in just a couple of nights. I had NO idea."
2021-06-23 16:50:05,wallstreetbets,"Surely - first I'll say that I was aware of this previously, but I remember it being sort of ""written off"" in my mind a year (?) ago or so...  I believe PRPL addressed this in a call and it became apparent that the tax expense was ""non-cash"" and that free cash flow was a non-issue. I don't think free cash is an issue today either. As someone playing the stock and not being heavily ""invested"" or looking for direct cash back from the investment, I think it's OK for me.

Now to actually look at this objectively, I'll say a couple of things that I think about this...

1. Public shareholders don't fully realize the value of positive tax specifics of companies. Likewise, they don't discount the value of a company completely for payments like this. However, I don't think it's because they don't care; I think rather that they don't fully understand (me included to a point). 
2. The implications of this TRA are negative to shareholders, most of which are institutional. They are clearly betting on growth outpacing the obligations of this agreement. For small fish and especially those of us playing with fire (options), the implications are even less critical.  The stock will go up as the business grows, even if shareholders see less direct return. For my calls, that's all that matters.
3. Financials only moving up recently... Even with this ""looming"" over the stock....
   1. Adjusted EBITDA up 115% YOY Q1
   2. Revenue up 52.3& YOY Q1
   3. Gross Margin improved by 3.4%
   4. Operating expenses held constant
   5. Adjusted net income $0.17 per share, up from $0.08 per share
   6. Cash on hand remains over $100 million
   7. Cash on hand was down some YOY due mainly to $12+million on expansion project(s)

  
Largely spitballing here, but I guess my main point is that I don't see it as a huge deal. Even on the sheet it's a relatively small item in the grand scheme of things. Smaller if you're an options trader."

I remember going into a mattress store to try it out and laying on theirs and buying their stock and thinking, this company is going to buy me the best mattress I've ever owned"
2021-06-23 18:40:44,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the answer and for taking the time to spell it all out. 

Definitely agree that for a short to mid-term play that it probably wouldn't matter, and it's a good point about the growth outpacing... I guess my initial reservation was more so the nature of the agreement and whether the liability grows as those ""tax savings"" from the assets provided also grow. The filings go on and on about how it's an accounting estimate and hard to determine, etc. etc., but doesn't go into the company's assumptions or horizon for determining the long term value of the liability.

Either way, perhaps just a small cloud hanging over something that seems like it's in a pretty decent spot to shine bright."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$MX - Magnachip Semiconductor - Get it in before it takes off This will be a short post about why I think now is a good time to get in on $MX before takeoff.

**tl;dr; from a more detailed DD:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o21lmu/mx\_dd\_a\_buyout\_value\_play\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o21lmu/mx_dd_a_buyout_value_play_analysis/)

* Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation is an odd company that is incorporated in Delaware, is headquartered in Luxembourg, and operates almost entirely in South Korea designing and manufacturing analog, mixed signal, and digital semiconductors. Among its various product offerings, Magnachip most notably controls the second largest market share globally for OLED display driver integrated circuits, preceded only by Samsung. Recently, their stock has seen a lot of up and down movement due to a combination of multiple potential buyout offers, shareholder litigation, and federal regulatory interference that, given the following information, presents a clear buy opportunity at the current price point.
* 1st Buyout Offer - Wise Road - buyout offer proposing the acquisition of all outstanding shares at a price of **$29 per share** \-> This led to an overnight increase in share price from the low $20s range to \~$25
* 2nd Buyout Offer - Cornucopia - This second buyout offer came with a proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of $MX at **$35 per share** compared to Wise Road's $29 per share offer.
* On June 16th, the CFIUS imposed an ""Order Establishing Interim Mitigation Measures"", ordering Magnachip and Wise Road to completely halt all further progress/discussion on the merger until their review was approved. As a result, Magnachip further delayed its shareholder meeting intended for June 17th to a currently unspecified future date.

**Analysis**

https://preview.redd.it/2p9eq95kg0771.png?width=1712&format=png&auto=webp&s=425a870cf19d524ea2047907b3edd7de3e1d289a

As you can see from the chart the stock sky rocketed immediately (\~$23 - $26.5) after the last news regarding buyout went live. There was no time to jump in and still make a profit.

Now everyone is waiting to hear what will happen with the buyouts so the price is low. It seems that the stock hit resistance around $23.5 - $24. It's unlikely to go any lower than what it is now. Once we hear about the buyout the price will blow up immediately leaving no time to jump in then.

**My Opinion**

For risk averse people buying stock makes sense as it's hard to time when the stock will move significantly and it's very unlikely to go lower than 24$. Price target $29-$35 over the next few months.

For poor apes like me who like to yolo, the calls have low IV (\~40-50%)  and offer a lot of upside if you time it well.

**Positions**

5x July 16 '21 30c (price over the past few days was $10-$30)"

2021-06-23 16:12:11,wallstreetbets,"Its funny you say this because I went to China a few years back and it was really like a mash up of all the American decades put together. Lots of men and women were wearing what I would deem 1950's and 60's clothes. When it came to laws, you could drink in a car without a seatbelt on, most people smoked and you could smoke anywhere (including inside buildings and restaurants). There was no health and safety awareness or care; people could just have their baby on their knee while riding their scooter past a police officer. Some high bridges didnt have railings (sentiment was just; be careful or you could get hurt). Kids could buy beer from the store if they wanted to and the kids just kinda roamed the streets on their own.

It was kinda cool cause there was lots of freedom to do what you wanted without much oversight similar to past decades. As long as you didnt talk shit about the Gov., you could pretty much do whatever you wanted.

Wont go back now since the CCP has gone off the deep end."

It's a docu-movie that followed the NY Club-Kid scene - specifically Michael Alig and his rise and fall. The directors actually lived through that time in NYC and made a movie that is definitely worth watching.

Edit - after re-watching - I am totally wrong. It's been a while since I have seen Party Monster thought it was the money success fame glamour scene: found it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNyEvsh2TCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNyEvsh2TCw)

Even as the Soviet government was a decade out from collapse they too saw the writing on the wall and started embracing Russian cultural trends. With usual KGB oversight of course!

Punks also existed in the 80s in Siberia. Interesting country, but they certainly had Western exposure beyond what most people realize. Exchange students, Twin/Sister-City Expos, and such led to more Western paraphernalia and customs crossing the iron curtain than most people today realize."

But I think there has been enough positive news and we‚Äôre creeping up on earnings. I think it just climbs without the stop and hits the top of the channel at $26 within a week or two.

\*i might or might not change your life, or atleast your account balance.

today i will be writing about alibaba stock ""BABA"" and exlplain my thesis regarding the underlying.

# intro:

Alibaba Group Holding Limited operates various segments including : core commerce, cloud, digital media, entertainment, payment services...

business which Alibaba group own: Taobao, TMALL, Freshipo, Lazada, Ali-express, Alibaba, ele,me, 1688, youku, alibaba-cloud, alimama, cainiao network, dingtalk, ant group, ali-pay

Alibaba group does business in almost every thing you can imagine, therfore you can compare them to every big tech you know, they stand with the big dogs.(AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT) but they get less attention at the moment.  i think the sentiment towards alibaba is bound to change, very soon.

**Why BABA ?, why now ?**

baba showed negative performance relative to the other tech stocks at the moment (market sentiment due to politics - alot of impact on the stock) . but baba strength can be seen in a few areas: revenue growth, solid financial position with reasonable debt and very reasonable and cheap valuation. the profit margins are lower when comparing to peers right now but baba business have much to grow and much to be expected to fix that issue.

Baba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before, but i think the next earning this year will reveal growth in EPS.

Now, lets start of with the basics and take a look on baba financial and valuation.

&#x200B;

# valuation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/anm5scpa30771.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a6194d33f1165898de0cc04ce59c7e736bb9dbc

so looking at valuations:

Mkrt value:  573B

p/e: \~25x

Fp/e: \~21x

p/s: \~5.2x

p/b: \~3.9x -> very attractive at this rate !

eps(ttm): 8.48

eps(ntm): \~12

next e/r : Aug 19

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pkphleqb30771.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&s=102d445ee3ce2b7d931e42e4e62ea38ee0ae9d5e

At BABA current stock price of $211, the market is expecting revenue to grow at 48.8% for the next 1 years. Over this period, BABA is also expected to generate an average Economic Earnings Margin of 13.8%

Baba have increased theirlong term debt looking at their financials but due to increase in future revenue i believe it is nothing to be bothered by. debt is not an real issue to baba.

\*\*very important note is that comparing baba to other big techs valuations at the moment proves that baba is dirty cheap and can be a good short/long term play . even is market goes sideways i dont see baba going any lower than right now. 200 price is pretty strong ressitence and still a good price.

revenue growth: 47.96%

eps growth : 14.42%

i will be including a look into baba Assets and Liabilities, which i believe is showing us a healthy company which keep growing and expanding and inceasing their cashflow, revenue and shareholders equity.

## Liabilities:

## Assets:

**Profitability:**

Profitability in baba business is quite larger comparing to peers.

&#x200B;

# ANALyst reports:

most of the ANALysts recommend this stock. various price targets between 260\~350 price targets.

**and a few buying into: (including ark queen which i dont follow but nice to see)**

alot of big hedgies hold baba, you can check it out. (blackrock, goldman etc)

# Technicals:

52wk High: 319.32

52wk Low: 204.39

Avg volume (3M) : 15.8M -> breakout will increase volume obiously everybody watching the stock movement right now.

baba is down \~33% from the top at 319.32 (10/27/21).

I expect to see a bullish breakout in a couple days, can be happening anytime right now. good support at 209-210 level, every time we get there i can spot large money flowing into baba.

I believe that a price of 300$ before the year ends is possible and quite easy with a very little catalyst or sentiment change towards the company. right now from what im reviewing the sentiment towards baba is starting to chagne across the internet and financial market.

2021-06-23 11:03:57,wallstreetbets,"This was the first stock I took seriously. I‚Äôm amazed that it isn‚Äôt trading as high as it should be. Baba is the FAANG of China pretty much all wrapped into one. IMO the market discounts it because it‚Äôs China and their profits are based in RMB, not so much dollars. Alibaba has a big moat, dedicated workforce with their 9/9/6, government support, good profitability, etc. I sold out of baba to buy Tesla because sentiment wasn‚Äôt being helpful. Yet still I remain bullish on BABA because all bear cases are still weak af. Godspeed retard"

2021-06-23 09:16:00,wallstreetbets,"Well its not most of my equity, neither most of the trade is on OTM calls right now, but yeah i will increase the size of them. happy to be a part of wsb always."
2021-06-23 08:26:19,wallstreetbets,the DD I didn't even know I needed.
2021-06-23 10:52:40,wallstreetbets,"dont try, too many normies became aware of wsb and their only meal is meme stocks."
2021-06-23 08:40:12,wallstreetbets,every other stock you buy just skyrocket ? what was your reason for the buying at the time you bought ? you cant reflect old situation to new one. anyway you are welcomed to read the DD and decide for yourself.
2021-06-23 14:05:35,wallstreetbets,"don‚Äôt fret the negativity. Dumb money will always hate chinese stocks bc they buy into stupid FUD while the smart money is quietly loading the boats on dips. When the stock price is low, apes will scream scam and delisting and whatever idiotic theories that don‚Äôt make sense. Which to me is crazy considering the other conspiracy theories peddled here. Chinese stocks are just down bc they ended quantitative easing first and their bond market is dead in a gutter. But that just means they will go that much higher and recover faster when smart money decides it‚Äôs time to look for real value, or a catalyst makes the stock too attractive for HFs and the like to build positions quietly. You have to ask who is selling at this point? Impatient investors and dumb money."
2021-06-23 07:51:14,wallstreetbets,Thats crazy lol I feel sorry for baba investors
2021-06-23 07:55:20,wallstreetbets,"well i wasnt talking on last year price, i am buying this price at this time for the reasons i provided in the post. you do you."
2021-06-23 10:53:07,wallstreetbets,buy puts and lets meet again.
2021-06-23 08:59:59,wallstreetbets,you know jack ma isnt the ceo anymore right ?
2021-06-23 09:46:55,wallstreetbets,"truly ? idgf about jack ma, he isnt the ceo anymore. even if we wont ever see him again ali baba wont dismantle. its a big comapny which represents people who works there, salarys, revenues to shareholders.

the company will be fine and even better without this stupid man."
2021-06-23 08:03:20,wallstreetbets,where you see risk i see potential.
2021-06-23 10:11:10,wallstreetbets,lets compare in 2-3 months ? please buy them.
2021-06-23 13:01:46,wallstreetbets,"well, i tried."
2021-06-23 07:54:57,wallstreetbets,Most people lost money on this stock and therefore treat it like an ex girlfriend
2021-06-23 08:25:52,wallstreetbets,Hasn't that always been the case tho?
2021-06-23 08:38:45,wallstreetbets,If baba drops to 200(which is 13$ from now) im dropping another 10k on far otm options. gl in w/e trades you take man.
2021-06-23 09:22:14,wallstreetbets,I think investing in China stocks is risky. It‚Äôs less than 2% of my portfolio so in the end it won‚Äôt matter much.
2021-06-23 14:08:27,wallstreetbets,"agree with every word, so far ive added 4k, on yesterday and today dips. its funny they dont understand how much US s is dependant on china economics, baba wont get delisted never, they never meant to delist it. but nvm that, i got my thesis and im standing strong on it."
2021-06-23 07:54:06,wallstreetbets,"I heard that they are taking donations at this point                                          
 
1-800-FeedABABAInvestor"
2021-06-23 07:59:49,wallstreetbets,"I think you took that the wrong way, Im with you on this. Im still waiting for a little bit more confirmation on the price before grabbing some leaps, since this could easily hit the high 300s in the next 8-10 months Imo"
2021-06-23 09:53:25,wallstreetbets,"I didn't say he was, but when he disappeared for 3 months and the stock price went down until he resurfaced yet never fully recovered.  Alibaba is a big company as you've stated, and they have a lot of divisions, any of which could piss in the cornflakes of some party official.  Imagine you're sitting there balls-deep in some options and then all of a sudden that official makes an announcement that causes a flash crash in the SP.  Is that the kind of investment you're looking for?

Hell, within the last 24 hours they just zeroed out the oldest running newspaper in HK because they weren't sufficiently loyal.  I don't welcome that kind of risk and it shouldn't be ignored by any prudent investor.

If I absolutely had to take a position I'd do long puts, slap a limit sell on it, and wait for the eventual vertical red line day for it to trigger and cash me out."
2021-06-23 10:03:20,wallstreetbets,"Obviously it's not about Jack, it's about the Chinese government wanting to limit both Alibabas and Tencent foothold on their economy and curtail their influence.  First thing is Obviously letting competition grow and if they want the government will just subsidise a few competitors to ensure their monopoly is no more.

First sign was Alipay being suddenly told that they need to adhere to the same regulations as banks after almost a decade and a half. Naturally the question is how much can the government start imposing regulations and whether or not they've a plan to do so or if they just wanted to bring individuals back in line..."
2021-06-23 10:31:33,wallstreetbets,"The potential to sell your body on the street to make rent after the company you own stock in is nationalized. 

Why not JD instead? The are in a similar position to BABA, and the shape of their charts is nearly identical. Safer bet overall without issues with China looming."
2021-06-23 17:24:13,wallstreetbets,"Not saying there isn‚Äôt potential, but the potential doesn‚Äôt come from China nationalizing and delisting"
2021-06-23 13:32:23,wallstreetbets,"Nah. I'm good just watching yours expire worthless.

My focus is on better opportunities under the radar that will pop in the next couple of months that few others are talking about right now."
2021-06-23 07:56:40,wallstreetbets,"i can understand that, those people know nothin about the market, and thats fine, it wont prevent others from making money."
2021-06-23 17:52:42,wallstreetbets,This. Still stalking her though
2021-06-23 08:02:20,wallstreetbets,"just dont buy the ticket after the train has left the station, thats all. wishing you luck anyway."
2021-06-23 09:56:55,wallstreetbets,"buy your puts. lets meet again at around dec and compare between our trades.

baba took a hit cus ant not ipo and ""cut"" on valuation, nothin to do with ma. but you do you and ill do me. good luck ."
2021-06-23 10:44:30,wallstreetbets,"i dont agree about them being the same, every company has its own issues/ negative/ positive points, anyway if JD looks more promising to you then go ahead. i will remain honest, i didn't looked throughly into JD so thats also a reason for me not to choose them, but from the little i did - i choosed baba to continue. buts there plenty of plays in the market, lets all make money."
2021-06-23 09:55:45,wallstreetbets,"BABA is my gradschool wife that i'm sinking money into until she takes the reins, then I can retire and become a stay at home dad."
2021-06-23 08:07:48,wallstreetbets,Hahahah yeah I got 40 at 209-211 so I‚Äôm hanging long!
2021-06-23 16:59:12,wallstreetbets,This is WSB. If you were looking for people that know about the market I think you took the wrong turn lol
2021-06-23 10:20:24,wallstreetbets,"I said ""had to"".  Stocks are gambling and gambling is actually risk management and mitigation.  I'd rather not take a spin on Chinese companies until the governmental situation is stable and rational and I can nail down some of the unknown unknowns."

2021-06-23 11:31:44,wallstreetbets,"To all the WISH haters saying WISH sells cheap crap therefore is a crap comany:  Walmart sells junk, has been for decades, Target's crap isn't much better.  McDonald's literally sells edible poison that causes heart disease and diabetes. Tesla sold cars that actually exploded. What about Microsoft? Remember the Windows phone? There are tons of companies that manufacture and sell crap, yet are extremely popular and profitable.  WISH is not the products they sell, they are an e-commerce marketplace, that is their business, that is where their value is. WISH is gaining marketshare by the minute in the developing world.  Is McDonald's a successful company because they sell the best food? No.  Is KIA a successful company because they make the best cars? No. Get your heads out of your pretentious asses. /end rant"

‚Ä¢	60% SI is absolutely insane, was highest shorted stock a week ago at 41%, was identified as a squeeze candidate at 27% two weeks ago (had 2X the SI of AMC at the time)

‚Ä¢	 WKHS Cost to Borrow jumped more than 200% yesterday. ORTEX data shows the New estimated max to short has went from 11.96% to 25.24%! It‚Äôs getting way more expensive for them to short!

Was reported only 6000 shares to short though (400,000 yesterday)

‚Ä¢	New SEC ruling in effect today targets ending the insane levels of naked shorts, so shorts have almost no where to turn and can be margin called within 1 hour now

‚Ä¢	Owns patents for drones that launch and return to their EV delivery trucks, no one else has this tech let alone actual EV delivery trucks on the road like Workhorse

‚Ä¢	FAA drone approval this year

‚Ä¢	Over $600 million of EV truck orders

‚Ä¢	EV refrigeration prototypes

‚Ä¢	Strategic development agreement with manufacturer of current gas-powered USPS vehicles

‚Ä¢	Ramping up exponential EV truck production with Hitachi

‚Ä¢	Horsefly drone passed all 45 stringent tests that also involved humans, delivered organs

‚Ä¢	UPS now has confirmation of horsefly tech being successful and FAA compliant

‚Ä¢	IKEA continues to be spotted using workhorse trucks

‚Ä¢	Institutional ownership continues to increase

‚Ä¢	Debt free, $250 Million cash on hand

I'm 2100 shares in at $15.21 basis.

2021-06-23 19:39:55,wallstreetbets,"Opposite. WISH is a ticking time bomb for puts and shorts who are losing traction week after week. Look back two weeks. The Monday spike from two weeks ago was smaller than the spike from this week.

Puts are disadvantaged right now because a bunch of whales have built out a ramp of calls across the next several months, so every $1 tick up is adding a lot more market maker hedging for bulls than the handful of bears buying weekly puts can outweigh. WISH is waiting for some stupid bears to overplay their hand one week and get caught out on a bad short position, probably as soon as the company gets a couple of catalysts in play. In the mean time puts are going to keep sapping bear account balances faster than bulls'.

If you look at the call positions out a couple months, they are built into the 20s, which means bulls just need to keep up the pressure and it'll get easier with each passing strike point ITM."

Also, is the DD actually relevant? The *only* thing I care about in a DD is value portfolio in the present and value portfolio in the future.

Someone telling you that a company is going to be the best thing evarrrrr is not the same as measuring value of the company. Popularity IS a determining factor, as is the sentiment of the investor behind the company... but it isn't enough by itself.

If all you have is hype and high retail ownership, the distribution of people who actually profit is going to be terrifying. It's literally basic bell curves. 90% of people will lose their investment"

I bought the times into WISH‚Ä¶just below $8, ~$10 and final investment at $11.5. It‚Äôs going to happen and I look to maintain a long term e-commerce WISH"
2021-06-23 19:46:24,wallstreetbets,"Whatever. The only EV with any potential upside in the next few months is CCIV/LCID, and you're probably late for them as they're overpricing merger and the launch of their car delivery in July. You might be able to buy-write yourself into something that earns you 10% by October right now based on the low IV premiums. WISH is returning that in a week right now, and has a much higher potential upside over the same 3-4 month horizon.

However, you do you. Chase that short term feel good novelty."

Open CSPs on Friday for the following weeklies based on the max pain at-the-money strike. Build discount share positions. Open CCs against the shares on Monday against the strike with about 0.3 delta and exit them late on on Wednesday/first thing Thursday. When you exit the CC weeklies, you're fucking bears and collecting small amounts of profits to run the CSPs on Friday. You're also amassing shares that build the supports that keep fucking the bears further."
2021-06-23 10:34:09,wallstreetbets,"From my management experience previously, the more ads shows up in a lot of channels - since you mentioned you have seen the name shows up all the time, it's either it's a fly by night attorney firm that no one wants to have anything to do with or they still do not have enough people to form the class action hence the heavy ads to create more traffic to attract ignorant people that think whenever they invest in a stock, there is no way for the stock price to go down and lose money. Every stock investment is a guaranteed millionare stamps in investor portfolio."
2021-06-23 08:32:26,wallstreetbets,How are they undervalued if they have a class action lawsuit for lying about earnings? That means their shares were sold overvalued and they are being sued for it. I also don't see a large following of wsb as wish isn't even on the main tickers list till today. I am seeing alot of amc game cln bb and clv and recently whks. Why are you thinking all of wsb is in on wish?

If it crosses that next stop might be 35.  A cup with handle is setting up in my humble opinion with handle completing at 28.  Lets see if it zooms above 25.90 tomorrow and then 28.  Keeping my fingers crossed.
2021-06-23 16:23:31,wallstreetbets,Not sure about KBH. Numbers don't look bad. Slightly less revenues than expected but overall a solid report. The stock will be fine in a month or even next week.

1. This sub is for entertainment purposes only. While fun to jump on one or two of these meme plays, it's probably going to end badly, so do this sparingly.



2. See all these tickers flying? 95% of them will fail. Don't buy into the hype, and if you are a spineless bitch and can't help but FOMO, this is the wrong place.



3. Put in the time to learn how to trade properly. The goal is to make enough money to join in these really stupid bets. Real trading is boring, and WSB shit posting makes it bearable.



4. Bears are fucking stupid, but so are perma-bulls. Fuck you.



5. Either learn how options actually work, or make a massively large play and post it for me to laugh at and feel better about myself. 



6. If you're not already independently wealthy and/or a Nihilist, you're gonna have a bad time ignoring this advice.



7. When you don't know what to do and start feeling like you should panic sell, put your hands down your pants and get that 3-4 day unshowered gooch stank all over them. Take big deep sniffs. Feel the manliness wash over you."

*We won't prevent you from selling shares you get through the IPO Access program. However, if you sell IPO shares within 30 days of the IPO, it's considered ""flipping"" and you'll be restricted from participating in IPOs for 60 days.

Issuing companies and their underwriters often try to avoid IPO stock flipping. Flipping could lead us to offer fewer IPOs in the future.*"

2021-06-23 12:10:13,wallstreetbets,"$MAPS  
 Guys I just want to explain something to you... I work in the cannabis industry in Colorado and I think Weedmaps is absolutely the biggest and most important listing any dispensary can have. Not being on Weedmaps is like not having your product advertised at all... and they are integrating with the ordering and delivery systems used by most dispensary businesses as well... this company reaps $3-5 thousand bucks per month per location for each client and they will only begin to generate more revenue and higher profit margins as they are already set up with a working delivery application that integrated with these highly regulated systems. No other business will be able to take market share without HUGE investment and perfect execution that works within the highly regulated framework of legal cannabis... this is too difficult and that means WM has carved out a massive niche and cornered the market already for the next 3-5 years."

2021-06-23 15:47:55,wallstreetbets,"I know we're not supposed to be too serious here, but anybody reading, please listen.

Make sure you are being disciplined. Make sure you understand and think about what you're doing.

Don't ever trade mad or emotionally. I made a YOLO and despite YEARS of being very disciplined and ""knowing"" all the right things like ""don't risk what you aren't willing to lose"" and ""pigs get slaughtered"" and ""have defined risk for your trades"" I never ONCE thought about the downside risk or exit strategies for the downside.

I never once thought ""how much of this are you actually willing to lose?""

The worst part is the trade went very much in my favor...at first. It went up a bunch but when it just barely missed hitting my exit prices I got annoyed. I thought about selling and even felt very strongly that I should, but then the thought ""what if it keeps going up?"" came. I made the trade to begin with because I was upset and mad. I only defined my upside, but not my downside.

Then it dipped...and kept dipping...and kept dipping. And I could have sold for a profit at ANY point. But I didn't. For days. And then one day I was a bit in the red...but I was sure it would go back up, it had to...and I still didn't sell. And then on and on and on, never once really considering how bad it was getting and how I should just get out and cut my losses.

Be smart, don't be me. Look out for yourself and your bankroll. Even if you don't ""need"" the money it will haunt you when it's gone and the ghost never really goes away. So unless you want a monkey like that on your back for the rest of your life...be smart. Don't be me."

2021-06-23 11:03:21,wallstreetbets,"I initiated a position in VLDR. Why I like it: they are diversified in technology such as TaaS and has multiple partnerships with major corps like Google, Ford, etc. I‚Äôve enclosed a company timeline. The creator David Hall is a rock star who started Velodyne Acoustics and even cooler he competed and won several competitions in the first season of Robot Warriors (he built Drilzilla). After all of that you have a great company with sound fundamentals, strong leadership, and a pipeline of cutting edge products. The price is relatively low (11.60). I think they are doing a great job of finding and taking advantages of opportunities within the market. I‚Äôm sold. Good luck to you all.

2021-06-23 07:54:58,wallstreetbets,"I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined."

My biggest fear is alleviated by this one line in the article, ""A share sale in Hong Kong gives stateside-traded Chinese firms a foothold that acts as a hedge against the risk of being kicked off U.S. exchanges, while allowing them to broaden their investor base closer to home."" 

Even if delisted, XPEV owners will still own shares and will have a place for them to be traded. This was many investor's fear. 

Today should be an interesting day for the stock.üöÄ

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RNG from the USA, weekly update: Renewable Natural Gas set for disruptive growth $CLNE Hello,

here a good article from Forbes, dated 19-06-2021, [Renewable Natural Gas set for disruptive growth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/06/19/renewable-natural-gas-set-for-disruptive-growth/?sh=3d9c395d2ffe)

The incipit of the Forbes' article says everything

*"" Imagine if you will a renewable source of energy without constraints of time of day or weather. A renewable source of energy whose surface of potential is just now being scratched. Perhaps most importantly in today‚Äôs political environment, a source of renewable energy that does not rely on supply chains dominated by adversarial nations as the source of its feedstock, but America‚Äôs family farms instead. ""*

2021-06-23 09:50:06,wallstreetbets,">It's actually a carbon negative fuel because it removes so much methane and green house gases from the atmosphere. 

Yes but it's more that it prevents methane from going into the atmosphere rather than removing it.  You do release CO2 if you burn it, but CO2 has less of a warming effect than methane."

2021-06-23 15:29:55,wallstreetbets,"Alright gents, let me tell you about a little pharma company called Trillium Therapeutics $TRIL.  Like most pharma plays, this is a long term play on leaps or shares, so just downvote right now if you want fast money.  They've created the first CD47 targeted monoclonal antibody (two drug candidates) for the treatment of blood cancers.  WTF is a CD47 MAB?  I'll leave that up to the reader, but what you need to know is that there already exists a very similar drug called Darzalex that targets CD38.  Darzalex has $4B/yr in sales and if TRIL's drug makes it to market you can expect similar sales long term.  Essentially every patient that is on Darzalex will eventually run out of drugs to treat their disease and they'll then need TRIL's drug.  If TRIL's drug is highly effective like Darzalex, it will be moved up to front line treatment, meaning patients will get this drug earlier or even as the first treatment they receive upon diagnosis.  

These drugs are for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma (MM), for which there is no cure.  Like I said, a MM patient will eventually go through every drug available until all options are exhausted.  

The major risk obviously is that trials fail and the drug never makes it to market.  Other risks are if they do make it to market, but the side effects aren't mild, it will never be a front line treatment option and sales will be lower.  Lastly there are major advancements happening with the treatment of MM and CAR-T and BiTE trials, with some patients remaining in remission long enough to start thinking they may be cured, but even if not cured these patients might go years without any treatment needed at all.  If they work the kinks out of CAR-T or BiTE and large percentages of patients are effectively cured or in long term remission, Darzalex and TRIL's drugs will definitely suffer.

How to play this?  I'm not sure, I'm holding 500 shares, but I'm going to buy some leaps, just not sure how far out to buy.  I'll be holding the shares for years, but the leaps I'm going to sell when there's a big run and then buy back in after a pullback.  I'd expect some big runs as the trial data starts coming in, and as you can see this stock has already seen some previous hype with it shooting up to $21 back in Dec."

So what do we have here? The n¬∞5 on the smartphones market is also choosing AMD's technologies for its next smartphones! Just to remind you, this is a well known company in Asia, that keeps growing and has 8% of the market today. 

This is just another sign that AMD obtains more and more contracts on this new market (smartphones and potentially very small laptops).

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why Tilray ($TLRY), Canopy ($CGC), and every other Canadian LP are going to 0 Most of the Canadian weed co. bagholders invoke the following logic:

1. Access to the U.S. market via SAFE banking (or federal legalization) will dramatically increase the revenues of Canadian licensed producers (LPs)
2. SAFE banking will permit LPs to acquire competing incumbent multi-state operators (MSOs)

Here's why this will never happen:

1. A state-by-state regulatory model is likely to persist under a full federal legalization scenario. Consider alcohol: it has been federally legal for a century, yet hard liquor can only be purchased at government-run ABC stores in Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and several other states. Weed will follow a similar model, with access largely under the purview of the state legislature‚Äì‚Äìnot the federal. This means limited licenses. Nobody wants a dispensary on every corner. And states will want to protect their local industries for as long as they can.
2. LPs are unlikely to win any prominent MSOs on the M&A market once cannabis is legalized or banking is permitted. LP balance sheets have been run into the ground by management teams of grifters and morons. It will be impossible for them to compete with the line up of multinational alcohol, tobacco, and CPG conglomerates that will leverage balance sheets several orders of magnitude larger than those of LPs to win deals. The Canopy-Acreage transaction is as good as it will get (if that even happens)

&#x200B;

tl;dr get off robinhood and get on a real brokerage that will let you buy OTC-traded MSOs"

2021-06-23 13:38:45,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs like an additional 18% tax and cannabis imports for Canada, Canadians are going to consumer Canadian weed."
2021-06-23 13:36:34,wallstreetbets,"Competition is fierce. If legalization happens in USA and weed is saturated like it was in Canada. What makes you think MSOS would survive? 

At least Tilray has shown profitability before taxes. And has the major market share in Canada. They will continue to grow that percentage to 30% of the market in Canada. While also having competitive products to launch in USA that MSOS may not have.

Do you remember in middle or high school when the biology teacher spoke about natural selection in bacteria? You put antibiotics most bacteria die, (over supply of weed + most LPs go bankrupt) while those that survive become antibiotic resistant and won‚Äôt die? I.e Tilray survived in hard conditions with over 800 LP competition for net profitability. Imagine once doors in US open, and once legalization globally happen. They will be ready. As they are surviving in the harsher environment."

2021-06-23 14:11:43,wallstreetbets,"Your info is incorrect. The numbers aren‚Äôt there for you.

2021-06-23 16:14:18,wallstreetbets,"Look. Your high. And being aggressive. Your eyes and ears are closed. 

I never said Cura is not profitable. Yes it‚Äôs making money now. Can that continue once legalization happen and keep that up for the next year 2 years with all the new competition? It‚Äôs a wait and see.

You need better reading comprehension I‚Äôm done responding to you."
2021-06-23 18:15:27,wallstreetbets,as long as CURA is on an OTC no one with any real money is going to look at them seriously. They need to uplist. TLRY has access to way more capital. IF Novartis or AB Bev extend their loose partnerships with TLRY and throw down some money the game changes. TLRY starts finding ways to buy a major MSO and then its over.

Remember the above ? \^

Time to go against this now. Fed's latest FOMC was a total disaster, 100% miscommunication. Some in the markets even said it meant the FED was renouncing its brand new AIT framework (Average inflation targeting) which took 3 years of debate to put on. so no, clearly they aren't gonna give up on this after some random meeting and Powell + Williams made that clear last 2 days. time to go long $GLD again. 

FYi AIT is a new framework for which the final aim is to maximize employments so long as inflation permits. 

Normally this is always the dual mandate of the FED but this is a different interpretation of it which allows for a lot more job gains; the societal goal behind it is to minimise joblessness among women and minorities at the poorest levels. 

Real rates, the main driver of Gold along with the dollar have both dipped back since the FOMC meeting, only gold is lagging this turn of events. Get long before it is too late."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV detailed DD Hi everybody, I've decided to finally try and write up a more in depth DD for CLOV because I think a lot of people have a tough time understanding their business model, and understanding why they have a legitimate shot at helping to fix one of the biggest issues with healthcare in America. For some background, I'm an MD who did my undergraduate degree focused on healthcare systems and economics-essentially many of the same courses someone pursuing an MPH would take (I actually did about 2/3rds of the courses required for an MPH at my alma mater). So in addition to being a WSB degen I understand what Clover Health is trying to accomplish, and I'm going to try and explain it because I think unlike a video game retailer or a movie theater most people have no idea wtf CLOV does.

# What is Medicare Advantage and why was it created?

To understand Clover's business model we first need to understand what ***Medicare Advantage*** is, because that's Clover's primary business model (though they also have expanded into Direct Contracting Medicare which is somewhat similar). Medicare Advantage was created by the government to try and fix a lot of the broken incentives in our healthcare system that have lead to rampant inflation in the cost of healthcare in the US.

Have you ever wondered why healthcare costs per person [**have more than doubled in the last decade?**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HLTHSCPCHCSA)  Healthcare costs have been growing for a long time and [have worsened wealth inequality](https://www.ft.com/content/0d7ea0c1-f0b8-4c8a-a532-f18f147079bc) due to growing 5X since 1980, but this inflation has accelerated the last decade so we're going to focus on the primary cause of this for simplicity.

Right now, literally everyone in the existing healthcare system has had financial incentives to continue driving up costs, from consumers to hospitals to physicians to drug companies to insurance companies. Focusing on insurance though, the crazy thing is that **insurance companies only make more money if healthcare costs more money.**

Wait a minute you say, ""That makes no sense! Why would insurance companies make more money if they're paying out more money?"" That might have been the case in the past but over most of the last decade insurance companies have been restricted by the [80/20 rule](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/rate-review/), a frankly economically stupid regulation that was ironically pitched as a way to bring costs down in health insurance. You'll often see this referred to as a ""Medical Loss Ratio"" especially when talking about earnings for insurance companies. But basically the law was changed so that insurance companies could only keep 20% of whatever money they charged for an insurance policy and had to pay out at least 80%.

So what did health insurance companies do? With this new law it meant that every insurance company was **now aligned with** ***higher*** **payouts to hospitals, physicians and pharmacies** and [stopped trying all that hard lower healthcare costs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5145008/) because the higher their payouts were the more money they could charge on their insurance policies the next year. That's become the primary way for health insurers to grow their profits and revenues. Letting healthcare costs grow out of control is a big part of why [United Healthcare stock has rocketed up in a straight line up for the last decade-up more than 1300% since Obamacare passed in 2010.](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/UNH#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-)

Now, most people in the United States may have private healthcare through their work. But a very large chunk of healthcare costs are paid out by the government through Medicare because the oldest and sickest patients that use the most healthcare dollars are people over 65. The most expensive healthcare in America is the catastrophic kind-where patients have a stroke, have a heart attack, get cancer, and then they require repeated hospitalizations and extremely expensive treatments that run well into the six and seven figures. As healthcare costs have gone completely insane the amount of money the government has had to spend on Medicare has gone crazy as well. Medicare Advantage is their attempt at trying to align better healthcare that costs less with higher profits for insurance companies. Instead of hospitals and doctors billing the government directly for care provided to Medicare patients, the government just hands over a set amount of money for each patient that an insurer covers. So the more patients a health insurance companies has, the more money they get from the government for taking care of those patients. This basically brings back into the system the old incentive where spending less money on healthcare leads to better profits. Now you're going to think, doesn't that just mean they'll just deny paying for everything and make bank? No, because combined with this the government also looks at the quality of the outcomes and care that patients get, and the better the patients do the higher the pay you get per patient. This is the government's attempt to fix the completely broken incentives in the healthcare system.

# Why Clover Health?

So now you have some idea of what Medicare Advantage is. Why should you invest in Clover and not just buy shares of United Healthcare and Anthem since they've been printing money since before JPow bolted the turbo to the money printer? What it comes down to are two things.

**1)** **Clover Health is a ""pure"" play where focusing on improving healthcare by preventing health problems before they become catastrophic will always improve Clover's profitability.** Clover only covers patients with either Medicare Advantage, or Medicare Direct Contracting (to avoid this being 80 pages long, this is a type of  hybrid of traditional Medicare with incentives for quality and cost reduction). This means that they can aggressively focus on improving healthcare quality, preventing patients from needing to be hospitalized, preventing patients from having those heart attacks, strokes, cancer. If other insurance companies aggressively improved the health of their patients they would actually make less money over time because the majority of their profits come from patients on plans where they only make more money if you're less healthy and requiring more and more expensive healthcare. If United Healthcare or Anthem successfully got their patients to be healthier they'd actually make less and less money due to the 80/20 rule! So they literally cannot be aggressive in pursuing a focus on preventing those terrible healthcare problems because they'll actually annihilate their own profits if they succeed. Any company that's attempting to do both traditional health insurance and also Medicare Advantage will be fighting with itself, either they do really well with Medicare Advantage or they do really well with their traditional insurance business. They can't actually succeed in both because the path to profitability for each are completely different. With Clover, if they succeed it's literally a win for everyone. It's a win for shareholders with larger profits, it's a win for patients because they have better health, it's a win for physicians because their patients are healthier which actually means less of a workload and physicians actually getting paid to keep people healthy, it's a win for the entire United States because we can maybe stop setting all our money on fire and maybe do something other than spend a quarter of a our salaries on healthcare while having our healthcare system [ranked last place against similar nations](https://www.citizen.org/article/dead-last-u-s-health-care-system-continues-to-rank-behind-other-industrialized-countries/).

**2) Clover Assistant**. This is the killer app that Clover has been working on, it's their electronic health records system that attempts to keep track of all the moving pieces in healthcare to help physicians help their patients in a timely manner. For example, a lot of the time a patient gets hospitalized and they get well enough to go home, but they're supposed to follow up with their physician to make sure that they're continuing to improve, that they're not getting worse again. In traditional healthcare what happens is that the hospital physician sends the patient home and gives them a pile of papers and written somewhere in there is that they should go see their doctor within a week. The patient may or may not read this, and even if they do they'll call their doctor and the phone number will be busy and since they're not feeling well to begin with the patient gives up. 2 weeks later, the patient is feeling sicker than ever and ends up calling 911, ends up back in the emergency room, back in the hospital. [Medicare has attempted to punish this type of thing by financially penalizing hospitals for this type of situation known as a bounceback](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program) but it's still a rampant problem. With Clover Assistant however, the software is constantly looking at every patient's record and if it sees that a patient was hospitalized and discharged it proactively notifies their primary care physician that hey, you need to see and follow up with this patient to make sure they're continuing to get better. Then their physician might intervene with something like a $20 prescription for new antibiotics to help the patient continue to improve, instead of yet another $20,000 hospitalization. That's just one example of what it can already do today, but the Clover Assistant will eventually be able to use a large dataset of health records with AI to discover new ways to improve healthcare.

# Addressing short seller critiques

To be frank, the report from Hindenburg sounds like it was written by someone with absolutely no real knowledge of healthcare or the healthcare business. But since this report is what so many people like to harp on when trashing Clover Health as some sort of scam I'm going to address the points they bring up.

**#1 Claim: Clover is being investigated by the Department of Justice.**

Clover received what is known as a Civil Investigative Demand from the Department of Justice, which is a request for more information from Clover to make sure that there is no Medicare fraud occuring. This doesn't mean that there's any actual fraud, but it's standard when the government is your primary payer that you get hit with these CIDs to make sure that everything is on the up and up. There's no credible evidence that this has any actual material impact on Clover Health's performance. As an example, where was Hindenburg's short report when [Anthem dealt with a DOJ CID in 2018?](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/anthem-doj-medicare-advantage-risk-adjustment-chart-review-civil-investigative-demand) If we [take a look at Anthem's stock during this same time period](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/ANTM#eyJpbnRlcnZhbCI6IndlZWsiLCJwZXJpb2RpY2l0eSI6MSwiY2FuZGxlV2lkdGgiOjM4LjU0Mzg1OTY0OTEyMjgxLCJmbGlwcGVkIjpmYWxzZSwidm9sdW1lVW5kZXJsYXkiOnRydWUsImFkaiI6dHJ1ZSwiY3Jvc3NoYWlyIjp0cnVlLCJjaGFydFR5cGUiOiJsaW5lIiwiZXh0ZW5kZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJtYXJrZXRTZXNzaW9ucyI6e30sImFnZ3JlZ2F0aW9uVHlwZSI6Im9obGMiLCJjaGFydFNjYWxlIjoibGluZWFyIiwicGFuZWxzIjp7ImNoYXJ0Ijp7InBlcmNlbnQiOjEsImRpc3BsYXkiOiJBTlRNIiwiY2hhcnROYW1lIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJpbmRleCI6MCwieUF4aXMiOnsibmFtZSI6ImNoYXJ0IiwicG9zaXRpb24iOm51bGx9LCJ5YXhpc0xIUyI6W10sInlheGlzUkhTIjpbImNoYXJ0Iiwi4oCMdm9sIHVuZHLigIwiXX19LCJsaW5lV2lkdGgiOjIsInN0cmlwZWRCYWNrZ3JvdW5kIjp0cnVlLCJldmVudHMiOnRydWUsImNvbG9yIjoiIzAwODFmMiIsInN0cmlwZWRCYWNrZ3JvdWQiOnRydWUsImV2ZW50TWFwIjp7ImNvcnBvcmF0ZSI6eyJkaXZzIjp0cnVlLCJzcGxpdHMiOnRydWV9LCJzaWdEZXYiOnt9fSwiY3VzdG9tUmFuZ2UiOnsic3RhcnQiOjE1MjAyMjYwMDAwMDAsImVuZCI6MTU1NDA5MTIwMDAwMH0sInN5bWJvbHMiOlt7InN5bWJvbCI6IkFOVE0iLCJzeW1ib2xPYmplY3QiOnsic3ltYm9sIjoiQU5UTSIsInF1b3RlVHlwZSI6IkVRVUlUWSIsImV4Y2hhbmdlVGltZVpvbmUiOiJBbWVyaWNhL05ld19Zb3JrIn0sInBlcmlvZGljaXR5IjoxLCJpbnRlcnZhbCI6IndlZWsifV0sInN0dWRpZXMiOnsi4oCMdm9sIHVuZHLigIwiOnsidHlwZSI6InZvbCB1bmRyIiwiaW5wdXRzIjp7ImlkIjoi4oCMdm9sIHVuZHLigIwiLCJkaXNwbGF5Ijoi4oCMdm9sIHVuZHLigIwifSwib3V0cHV0cyI6eyJVcCBWb2x1bWUiOiIjMDBiMDYxIiwiRG93biBWb2x1bWUiOiIjZmYzMzNhIn0sInBhbmVsIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJwYXJhbWV0ZXJzIjp7IndpZHRoRmFjdG9yIjowLjQ1LCJjaGFydE5hbWUiOiJjaGFydCIsInBhbmVsTmFtZSI6ImNoYXJ0In19fSwicmFuZ2UiOnsiZHRMZWZ0IjoiMjAxOC0wMy0wMVQwNTowMDowMC4wMDBaIiwiZHRSaWdodCI6IjIwMTktMDQtMDJUMDM6NTk6MDAuMDAwWiIsInBlcmlvZGljaXR5Ijp7ImludGVydmFsIjoid2VlayIsInBlcmlvZCI6MX0sInBhZGRpbmciOjB9fQ--) we can see that there was literally no impact from this on their share price, and since 2018 their stock has grown over 70%! It's absurd to believe that this has any material impact even if you do somehow believe that Clover broke the law in pursuing their vision. They pitch it as an ""existential risk"", essentially insinuating that the government would stop working with Clover even though this is clearly not true as CMS has continued to approve Clover for new programs and frankly this has never happened to any legitimate health insurer. [Clover also recently added this heavy hitter to their board](https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/health_care/clover-health-taps-former-cms-official-for-board/article_51803ebc-e162-596b-a372-d7907d6abe7a.html) which will help them navigate the complex regulations around Medicare.

**#2 Claim: Clover had tons of patients inappropriately funneled to them through Seek Healthcare**, a Medicare plan comparison portal owned by Clover's head of sales.

This claim just has no factual basis, the vast majority of plans recommended by Seek were for non-Clover plans so all the evidence out there points to them having been neutral in matching patients to a plan that would benefit them.  Regardless, Clover has made it clear on Seek's website that Seek is an affiliate of theirs.

**#3 Claim: Clover's software tries to ""upcode""**

If you're not familiar with healthcare this will sound negative, but what Clover's software is doing is literally what every piece of healthcare software does. Medicare billing codes can be coded higher (meaning that your care and work is seen as more valuable to Medicare) based on how much data you've included about a patient in your documentation. Traditionally on a paper chart a doctor would have needed to write down the x-rays, labwork, etc. to bill the higher codes but with electronic health records systems you can code at a higher level without extreme effort because all the data is right there. That's a large part of their business plan, because they can show that yes we have the data and our physicians are able to review this to provide better and more detailed care. Hindenburg makes it sound like they're doing something nefarious when in fact, reviewing and providing this extra data is exactly what will provide better care. Complete absurd negative spin from Hindenburg on this claim and I frankly don't know of any healthcare record software that would purposely not include healthcare data so that physicians would only be able to have rudimentary data-free documentation. That'd be beyond moronic.

**#4 Claim: Doctor's whine about Clover's software.**

So coincidentally in a past life I actually worked to train physicians to use electronic health record systems. I'm sure that Hindenburg was able to interview several physicians who would have complained about Clover Assistant, but the part they're not telling you is that a [third of physicians are over the age of 60.](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/physician-retirement-why-its-hard-doctors-retire) There is no software in existence that isn't going to be whined about by physicians, it doesn't matter if it's Allscripts, Epic, whatever, the reality is that the older physicians will struggle to learn any new software they have to deal with. If you've ever tried to help your grandma learn how to use a computer you probably have a good idea of what I'm talking about so to use this as a critique is yet again incredibly stupid.

**#5 Claim: Clover health pays doctors money to use Clover Assistant and they pay primary care physicians good money.**

Hindenburg tries to spin this as a negative, that doctors are getting paid $200 per patient visit to have them adopt Clover Assistant. Well, in order to improve patient outcomes and thus eventually make more money by having healthier patients the entire business model revolves around having physicians adopt Clover Assistant. Clover also pays primary care physicians more money because investing more money into primary care to prevent health issues down the line is their business model. **Studies show that** [**every $1 extra spent on primary care is going to save $12 down the line**](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/delivering-value-healthcare-starts-increased-primary-care-investment). This is actually what sets Clover apart from the other health insurance companies, they're going out of their way to pay primary care physicians more, so they can spend more time with each patient, **so they can use the Clover assistant to deliver higher quality care that'll prevent more health problems down the line**. Hindenburg doesn't actually seem to be able to at all understand Clover's Medicare Advantage business model here, which makes me seriously question how they felt they were qualified to analyze Clover at all.

**#6 Claim: Clover's CEO made his previous hospitals a ton of money charging a lot of money.**

I could go into the nuances of how the CEO justified this type of billing as a negotiation tactic with existing insurance companies that had bullied these hospitals into bankruptcy in order to save hospitals that were going to be shut down. But forget that and realize what you have here is a short seller ***spinning the CEO of a healthcare company being incredibly good at making money in healthcare as a negative***. I honestly can't think of a stupider fucking thing for a short seller to say.  Garipalli knows and understands the business of healthcare better than anyone else, and now with Clover he's going to fix how fucked up it is while Clover makes bank.

# Short term price catalysts/Short Squeeze prospects

This is probably the part that most of you degenerates care about so we probably should go over it. I think Clover health is going to be an incredible long term hold. Chamath thinks it's one of the most obvious 10-baggers he's ever seen and frankly I agree, but let's break down the short term.

Short Interest: Over the last few weeks SI has been 40-50% of the float. I know some people have talked about some institutional shares being misclassified, and the SI being even higher but it's not clear to me that this is the case. Nonetheless, [Ortex is looking into this](https://twitter.com/trades_dutch/status/1406999851313807362) so we'll know for sure what the correct numbers are soon enough. It really doesn't matter that much though, this is extremely highly shorted. When VW underwent their infinity squeeze **the SI was only 12%**, what actually made it squeeze was that all of a sudden the short sellers couldn't cover their position-that matters much more than the exact number the SI% is. 40-50% is honestly a massive number that's more than enough for a huge short squeeze to occur.

**Why did the price just jump?**

Now here's the big thing that makes me think that CLOV is a prime short squeeze target right now. If you read BS financial blog posts a lot of people claim that it's because of WSB reading the SEC filings where the short squeeze is mentioned as a risk, but that's not the reason. Obviously WSB has obviously thought it's a possible squeeze target for a long time so to believe that an SEC filing triggered the price runup is stupid.

The reason is simply that 6/22 is the day that a ton of shares became unavailable for short sellers to borrow. A ton of call options for CLOV expired ITM on 6/18. How these work is that they get executed after market hours finish and then the people who sold the calls have to settle them in 2 business days. That's known as T+2 settlement, which is the settlement time for options contracts in the US. So any hedge fund that sold naked calls had another 2 business days to provide the shares. Purchases can be done through prime brokerages with T+1 settlement, meaning that the last day a hedge fund or market maker could have scrambled for shares to hand out on 6/22 was Monday 6/21. So they had a lot of incentive to drive the price down and force some liquidity on Monday, which is pretty much what you saw happen. But Tuesday all those shares went to people who executed their ITM call options.

Now if you think about it, why would someone execute an ITM call option instead of just selling it off? It's because those entities want to hold those shares for a longer time frame. So as these shares got assigned off to folks who wanted to just hold these shares with their diamond hands you saw that share borrow availability tank. By 4PM on 6/22 there were ZERO shares available to borrow at IBKR and the borrow fee had jumped to almost 9%.

Regardless, that major change of hands in shares has likely made this one of the weeks where it's going to be harder than every before for short sellers to be able to obtain shares to close out their short position. Even though CLOV has had a very high short squeeze score for a while now [(100/100 at S3)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404880301428547585?s=19). I think the folks holding shares this week may be more likely than ever before to be the type that refuse to sell to the shorts cheaply.

# Long term value

This is admittedly hard to pin down because while CLOV doesn't currently generate profits they're an incredibly fast growing company. If they manage to achieve what they're trying to achieve the sky is going to be the limit, because we're talking about profit margins that would put every other insurer to shame while continuing to grow at double digit percentages per year. Plus while their current core business is Medicare Advantage and Medicare they also have an entire other business in the possibility of licensing out Clover Assistant. The EHR business could become another multi-billion dollar business alone. Allscripts is worth $2.5 billion and Epic is worth more but it's privately held. It's going to be years of work before Clover grows to a massive size and scale but I think if it does happen then Chamath's 10-bagger estimate is going to look conservative.

# Positions or ban

I [doubled down on my YOLO before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nr6rpz/clov_yolo_part_2_the_double_down/) but with the drop to the $11's on Monday I've added another 25,000 shares and now hold 98888 shares of CLOV. Ironically, I started buying CLOV trying to find a stock that was heavily undervalued and was going to put $100K into it. Now my attempt at building a diversified value portfolio with $1 million has somehow turned into this insanity but hey, I guess I've spent too much time here."

Honestly its a bit of a shame all the retards with 3 month accounts have jumped on this for the squeeze potential when really the reason to hold this is long-term growth. I hope it never squeezes and can just get some decent organic growth over the next few years.

OP what kind of PTs are you thinking for EOY?

Also what are your bearish concerns regarding CLOV? I know you addressed the criticism by the shorts, but what do *you* think could hold CLOV back in the next 3-5 years?"

2021-06-23 12:58:25,wallstreetbets,"So luckily, EHR systems in the US use a [standardized communication language known as HL7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Level_Seven_International), though typically it's a fair amount of work to interface with each other because the way one hospital system stores a type of data may not be quite the way another healthcare system does it. Over time they've come up with a lot of tools to help more rapidly bridge healthcare databases with each other. Clover is already able to pull data from many hospital systems with various different EHR systems-the good thing is that a lot of this compatibility work has already been done over the last decade so it's not as hard as it would have been 10-15 years back. 

Mostly it's a matter of reaching out to healthcare systems where they're expanding and negotiating with them for access-generally most healthcare systems wouldn't mind having two way data access with a network of patients like Clover since everyone having access to everyone else's data helps save a lot of time/money for them. In the past I've seen some healthcare systems refuse to participate in data-sharing efforts, but over time most large healthcare systems have become pretty open about sharing data.

So Clover will be able to interface with EPIC, or Allscripts, or whatever other healthcare systems use, though each expansion/integration will likely require some manpower to build a ""bridge"" that correctly syncs up the data in case they've stored it differently."
2021-06-23 12:46:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm not going to count on the Medicare expansion passing, they're already trying to do too many things and with the senate the way it is I doubt this kind of thing would pass right now. If it does happen then that would be a massive positive. CLOV is growing their patient population very rapidly right now and I like a lot of the initiatives they've been pushing for, providing in home visits, proactively helping provide transportation for patients to go see their physicians, etc. so I think once all these pretty great new initiatives of theirs become more widely known their growth will be able to continue at an incredible pace. I think it's premature to try and figure out an exact number for how much of the population they could capture, they're still only in a few states so just geographic expansion over time will be a large part of helping them capture more of the pie."

2021-06-23 13:07:51,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the response. It seems plausible, but like you mentioned ‚Äúbuilding the bridge‚Äù is a more arduous process to execute than it is to talk about. Although I‚Äôm a clinician in title, I do a decent amount of multi institutional research (mostly retrospective and admittedly niche in cancer) and using things like CareEverywhere for EPIC or Allscripts data is just simply not possible due to the lack of confidence in the data put in (I.e garbage in, garbage out). 

If CLOV is able to bridge that gap it would be extremely helpful, but I do think it would take a long time. 

Of note, I think some health systems might be less inclined to give access to data with all the recent breaches. Mayo Clinic was the only center that truly impressed me with their infrastructure to fight against cyber attacks, but most others are weak in this arena."

Then you'd be spending days on end trying to figure out over the phone with these guys who broke what.

Like I said, it's still a fair amount of work to interface, but it's already way less painful than it used to be. The reason I used to train clinicians on using EHR was that I used to implement EHR systems before I became a physician myself.

But yes, making sure that the data is what you expect it to be is a big part of being able to leverage that data to improve healthcare with their AI. Clover is much more laser focused on this than other health insurers are though, so while it's still a fair amount of work they're much more likely to pull this off correctly than anybody else."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLOV Technical Analysis -Shift Bullish Hello everyone,

 Besides  Clove being one of the most talked companies out there I wanted to share my thoughts on the Technical side of things

A couple of days ago I posted about CLOV and why I was not in  CLOV instead I was in WISH (I am still long WISH fyi)

I was waiting for a  few things to happen, before I changed my mind to bullish

One, I needed to see consolidation or  a massive one day move to the upside which in my opinion it happened on 6/22/21

We had an increase of volume today 6/22/21 vs average , todays increase was 3x its average

We broke to the upside of the downwards  wedge (Downwards/ Descending wedge are usually bullish  patterns As seen on pic below.)

https://preview.redd.it/qfe8ytdugy671.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fb930e52f1599617ed5eb93c1d1405cd038bc62

EMA 9 on the one hour period crossed EMA 50 finally, Last time this happened was on 5/25 when Ema 9 crossed ema 50  to the upside.(see pic below)

We are seeing that the price on the one hour chart is holding above EMA 9 (bullish sign) even thou we dipped below that EMA9, we bounced back up from the descending wedge resistance line (now acted as support)

And to sweeten the deal last candle closed above EMA 100!

In conclusion all these patterns and  price action we saw today , I believe and is my strong opinion that we have a trend change even thou anything could happen I am leaning towards  Bullish trend change.

Keep in mind 13.93 strong resistance level I will be watching for that level specifically.

I am now long $CLOV  at price entry $12.00, Also Long $WISH Price entry $13.00

After climbing to historic heights this spring, lumber prices are headed back down‚Äîfast. Last week the cash price per thousand board feet of lumber fell $211 to $1,113, according to industry trade publication Random Lengths. That's down 27% from its $1,515 all-time high on May 28.

""We are in a free fall,"" Andy Goodman, CEO of Sherwood Lumber, told Fortune. In the lumber futures market, prices are down even more‚Äîdropping 47% since going above $1,700 on May 10.

Is it worth buying a lumber stock? or shorting it until the housing market pops? or just rob home depot, and sell wood for the low? what you guys think.

i need help i‚Äôm a bit slow idk to short or buy, what you guys advising."

Short-term earnings are expected to be higher. Long-term, might come down. However, if housing production ramps up, then maybe overall demand will increase and lumber companies still make money.

2021-06-23 06:57:59,wallstreetbets,"Lumber is in fact in free fall. Secondaries treaters and distribution are dumping inventory to further flood the market. Here‚Äôs the thing it appears that this massive run was spun from hoarding of inventory and warehouses filling up with ‚Äúshadow inventory‚Äù. The cash market is even more desolate than Barron‚Äôs is letting in through random lengths. One of my buddies I trade cash lumber with literally can not find a price that buyers will issue purchase orders. The price has dropped from such an extreme height that dead cats should be expected. Further more the Canadians are starting to spend significant money to increase production. Yesterday I had an independent treater offering non treated stock significantly below mill pricing. Think about what that means! Now for the interesting part: panels specifically plywood and OSB appears to be done going higher and there is a tremendous amount of offering coming out shipping from warehouses and not the mill. It appears the same type of hoarding is what led to the shock. I‚Äôm not sure this unanticipated inventory flooding the market is fully priced in yet. Originally we were looking for $800/m as our target levels but we are basically there and cash market is lifeless. We are starting to look at $600/m. There is some uncertainty in that this opinion is becoming more accepted on the commercial level, so we could be getting close to the contrarians stepping in and buying up some of this ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù footage. Be careful as the pipeline appears full and the pendulum that swung to irrational highs is swinging the other way and will most likely over shoot the downside in a Similar but opposite manner as the upside."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Whats $CNO? Its your rocket to the moon - legit DD + Yolo Washington state politicians created a new law called Washington cares [WA Cares Fund (previously called Washington trust act).](http://www.wacaresfund.wa.gov/)

People have to get private LTC insurance or pay 0.58% of their post-tax income every year to get paltry benefits (this translates to 0.8-0.9% pre-tax). The benefits are capped at 35K/person lifetime and $100/day total. You have to keep paying it forever until you leave Washington and you lose benefits if you don't retire in Washington or don't contribute for 10 years.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n1zzhmps1y671.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9dc9037f09171991da5be9f559e331ba1e45e0e

There is no cap on wages. All wages and remuneration, including stock-based compensation, bonuses, paid time off, and severance pay, are all subject to the tax.

Currently, as the law stands, if you can just get insurance this year before November 1, you get an exemption and are all set for avoiding the WA LTC tax forever .. so if a family spends $450 on LTC this year for two healthy adults, they will save a lot of money if their income is over $100K and (as it stands from a few quotes I got) get better insurance benefits from private companies. The law incentivizes people to buy LTC for this year and quit next year, although many won't (the check presently is only once).

There is a poll on team blind (a networking site for professionals) and it shows how unpopular this payroll tax is going to be.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4mywy14u1y671.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd7313052f886f7ed13a1223a1f9a0a1570728d8

Here's the best part, it seems that the Washington Care law has made no difference on CNO price yet. This should lead to a positive earnings surprise for Wallstreet.

I personally have been trying to get LTC insurance - get this - agents are so overwhelmed it took me two weeks of active trying to get a quote... I still have to get a blood test but whatever. It used to be that you would enter your info online and get a call in 5 minutes.. that's the market Wallstreet has been pricing at. 

&#x200B;

I am betting my farm on it. 50 CNO calls between $24 and $25 for September earnings."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$FIZZ is about ready to pop! TL;DR I‚Äôm not going to say the ‚ÄòS‚Äô word right off the bat, but I think you‚Äôll get where this is headed.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

Let‚Äôs start with the basics: National Beverage Corporation is the Ft. Lauderdale, FL based parent company of a number of carbonated soft drink brands that you‚Äôve probably heard of and have likely tried in your lifetime, most notably: La Croix, Shasta, and Faygo (for all you former Jugglaos).

&#x200B;

[ Tastes like someone drank fruit juice and burped into my seltzer water. ](https://preview.redd.it/i7frbmqjzx671.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d0a79f9e59637a3a43e3855589a7a0bee26f041)

What makes them a long term buy: They‚Äôre competitive among much bigger firms ($KO and $PEP) (think $AMD vs. $INTC). They‚Äôve been consistently increasing market share and profitability. They‚Äôre more vertically integrated than competitors: They own both the production and distribution facilities.

They‚Äôre actually profitable with a good long term track record (unlike a lot of other companies being hawked on here). They pay dividends (but not always regularly), and have decent P/E at 25.47 (which is better than KO and the industry average). While slightly less than average EPS at $1.83 is good, it‚Äôs better than KO, and they have had huge EPS growth at 42% in the last 12 months. FIZZ has a 16% profit margin while PEP is only 10%. Last but not least, they have almost no long term debt!

Technically FIZZ has been a steady gainer as well, with 82.7% 12-month price performance and 20% 6-month price performance. They had a 2:1 split at the end of February this year after paying out an enormous $6 per share! special dividend at the end of January.

Earnings is coming up 7 JUL. It‚Äôs expected to go down compared to last quarter, but a surprise beat might give the price a bump. Worth noting here that they‚Äôve beat earnings estimates on the last 5/6 periods.

Here‚Äôs a couple news articles recently published on FIZZ:

2021-06-23 01:33:26,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for sharing this. 

Your graphic with a fair value of $60.76 is a DCF model that uses a discount rate of 5.8%. I‚Äôm highlighting that as some may consider it pretty low.

Why is everyone expecting down results on June 29 earnings? Don‚Äôt people drink more of this stuff during the pandemic?

Why do you think it may be an upside surprise?

Genuinely curious. I may jump on this tomorrow"
2021-06-23 00:44:54,wallstreetbets,"Actually sounds more interesting than most rubbish posted here usually (the ‚Äúpopular ticker‚Äù stuff). I know fuck all about the company though and will have to look into it myself.

Thanks for the idea, mate."

2021-06-23 00:46:47,wallstreetbets,Their main soft drink is sugar free carbonated water that's an office and fancy restaurant staple. People are starting to go back to the office and out to eat more.
2021-06-23 01:50:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this is the drink you drink when you are avoiding sugar and making healthy choices instead.  It's sparkling water with a hint of flavor.

2021-06-23 07:43:14,wallstreetbets,They're probably the ones shorting $FIZZ
2021-06-23 08:22:10,wallstreetbets,"And that right there is assuming that, since making more money isn‚Äôt his primary objective, it‚Äôs the long term health of his company and taking care of his investors. You don‚Äôt do that when your stock price is extremely volatile. Right now the stock price is healthy for what the company actually is with plenty of room for growth down the road but if someone were to artificially inflate the stock price he could easily sell off millions of shares to bring the price back down to a more reasonable and stable level. It would only be good business to do so for the long term health of the company. Volatility discourages long term investment and the drastic spike and crash of a squeeze can ruin even a good company. While this guy, and many many others, may hate short sellers, owners of solid businesses aren‚Äôt too thrilled with our tactics either, it brings too much unpredictability. As I said, FIZZ could be a good long term investment but the current environment where everyone is pitching every company with a high short interest for a squeeze is ridiculous."
2021-06-23 01:58:48,wallstreetbets,"LOL, sure - that‚Äôs making healthy choices"
2021-06-23 05:07:52,wallstreetbets,They were growing in revenue before covid but dipped a bit in 2020. Not bad i suppose
2021-06-23 08:36:02,wallstreetbets,"If he hasn't sold any shares up to this point, why would he start now? When it spiked in January they just announced a split instead."

2021-06-23 11:41:27,wallstreetbets,"FIZZ is a dark horse in the drinks industry. Pepsi had it out for them, with that lawsuit suspiciously coinciding with the launch of their bubly sparkling water. Pretty messed up. 

It's a good company. Wall St just doesn't like it when a CEO owns 70% of the company. They want more of the pie."

I am north off the Land of the Free, so I can‚Äôt really make an educated suggestion because our (way more limited) options are different from yours. It seems like most here are using Robinhood and Fidelity. Granted, they are apes, so take that with a grain of salt. Here, I use Interactive Brokers, which has its limitations, main one being slow as fuck as far as live pricing goes (I use limit orders almost exclusively, so it doesn‚Äôt matter as much), but there is nothing better functionality and pricing (fees) wise here that I know of.

Anyone notice anything going on with Rotech? These DME companies made a ton of money during the pandemic... but they are Causing many issues for employees and they seem to be going downhill fast... I was wondering if there's been any notable investments or changes in investments surrounding em. Especially Rotech. They tend to be stable investments.. but something isnt adding up with this... I swear they are inches away from offering employees stake in the company (obviously a few bad signs).

These companies also won't pay their employees reasonably, they made so much off the pandemic, but they basically hold the employees feet to the fire, because if they don't work, people don't get oxygen equipment and could die. They have taken away raises for an unsustainable bonus structure.. and just keep short changing employees, retention is in the toilet, which is hard on employees and people who need this equipment to survive, and they  keep making decisions that make little sense,  which I can't list off. I know there are lawsuit's around them too.
 Any input or  ideas around the companies and extrapolating their plans would be appreciated."

2021-06-23 02:18:28,wallstreetbets,"""call (strike price) way cheaper than the current price of the stock"" = this is literally the definition of an option term, ITM (In The Money). When it's deep in the money (= call strike price way cheaper than the current price of the stock"", the call itself will be extremely valuable/expensive and in most cases, buying that call will be similar to (or worse than) just buying the underlying stock in terms of return % on investment. Just think about it. That's how option pricing works. When a call is OTM, there is less likelihood that the stock's price will cross the call's strike price, which is why OTM calls' prices are cheaper. So you pay cheaper price to buy those OTM calls. However in the case those OTM calls suddenly (keyword: suddenly) become ITM because of a volatile move in the underlying stock's price, the now ITM calls are very expensive like any other ITM calls, and your return % on investment will be very big because your initial cost to buy the calls when they were OTM were cheap."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Prediction Stocks movement for this week Good evening. I am putting some stock moves and making predictions with it. I will post this kind of thread every week. 

&#x200B;

NIO is forming a good bullish movement for the next week based on previous movement data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5fdnplr8ox671.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=35f62d6cfde341c0832c38e65c294afa81144486

JPM is looking for a long bullish mode, the FED is going to raise interest rate sooner than 2023 predicted because fear of inflation. also it hit $148 3 moths resistance point. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f10ya3izox671.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb0d9646d299e623cc6bf4b6b252e4bc7497a5b1

PLTR is losing it's gains for the last 2 weeks after may 13th Long bull run. PLTR is nothing but a high customer Saas company which companies include only high profile government and government agencies. Because of their very narrow targeted audience and client base there is very little room to grow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ptk4wsi9rx671.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b7436fe6df32da9ee0459702880ea43da331e1

JMIA: I would look into JMIA into great interest. This is one of the top ecommerce site in Africa region, Many big companies are investing heavily in africa. I have a prediction amazon will also try to take over the Africa market, and soon JMIA will get an offer to for getting bought either by amazon or Alibaba for africa market dominance. 

&#x200B;

RIDE:

If u wanna short any company ride will be your #1. The CEO said fake numbers, new CEO also saying fake numbers. Doesn't have a product ready. They only formed a company only to lure investors and milking them. Lawsuits are piling. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gv5los44sx671.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=6486d1ffedebda7b31e5d915c2e5258e45b3fa2e

MNMD: They are creating a new market. very new, but effective. Although it may take years to see a useable product. This is like the very early stage of NIO or TLRAY. FDA approval will boost to the moon. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vesl0kgnsx671.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=1056582b3e1f8cfa8d201aeaa5bbdd853e69de19

&#x200B;

AMC: Amc might get boost until it hits $100 but will fall off rapidly. AMC is not like GME where there is good business. HULU, NETFLIX are making AMC business nonexistent. I would be very caution as a long term investor. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/37jgy7a7tx671.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3e9c9cc6299d72182b5e799bbaec2c5a0c5a987

ZM: Zoom might be a winner in the pandemic but it will be fruitful for longterm short players. With Google meet's free software and people are coming back to the office, ZM's over value position will trubmle.  Their growth is already falling down

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bmullta4ux671.png?width=545&format=png&auto=webp&s=238ce34d4ceb94c5b5a3e7a8c1d3dbb24eb53516

DASH: Their financials are horrible. Their valuation is overhyped. high volatility stock. Even during pandemic they managed to lose money in two quarters. props for that.

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Stop banning photo memes Stop banning photo memes. They were banned recently and I think that we should reverse this ban. There is nothing inherently wrong with them and they can be at times funnier than video memes, because (1) they are more easily digested, and (2) they have to fit humor in a Photo state, making it a shorter experience and a quicker joke. 

Un-banning them allows for an opportunity for funny memes to be discovered and upvoted, while dogshit ones get downvoted or removed.

I am not saying that allowing every single one is a good thing. I am, however, saying that putting an outright ban on them is ridiculous and should not continue to happen. Wallstreetbets had - for the longest time - a large amount of photo memes and nothing bad happened. Acting like photo memes are evil helps no one and does not ""improve the quality of content and make sure that only the best memes surface"". 

#THE VAST MAJORITY OF MEMES IN WALLSTREETBETS ARE DOGSHIT. BANNING A SPECIFIC TYPE DOES NOT HELP SHIT!

Some of the funniest and most related-to-the-sub memes are photo based! By banning them, you eliminate the chance for them to be seen and rightfully appreciated!

Memetron posted a photo meme today and I liked it. I did. It was sorta funny and represented what it needed to without having to be either a long-ass discussion post (like this one), or an edited video.

Zjz, please unban photo memes. They deserve to exist in wallstreetbets.

**TL;DR: photo memes should not be banned and the reason they are currently banned is silly**"

Why should WSB lower it's meme standards because someone thinks they're more ""digestable""?  

We already remove a tsunami of low quality shit memes, we would be overrun if we lowered our standards at all.

That said. Good luck!!!"
2021-06-23 04:54:54,wallstreetbets,Now this is a true WSB retard. YOLOing on options with 180% IV on a meme stock.

2021-06-23 03:46:26,wallstreetbets,If you are ever going to yolo in options (and for a rebuildable amount like 18k) WISH at this stage is a great idea.  Difficult to see it not at least testing higher levels with recent price history.

The strike price may be only $14, but his breakevens would be $17.52 & $16.25 after you include the cost per share he paid. If he exercised his options before that price, it‚Äôll still be a loss. However, the hope is that the price goes up and he can sell the contract rather than exercise the option."

2021-06-23 08:41:00,wallstreetbets,You are correct. Buying at high IV is a great way to lose all your money on a stupid yolo. Selling at high IV means you are in tendie town on the moon. All the giant % gains you see in AMC options are people that got in way before the meme run started when IV was super low.

2021-06-23 00:10:30,wallstreetbets,This. IV can go up or down just like share price. IV will remain high or go even higher the more volatile a stock becomes (ie. if the rate $WISH goes up starts picking up to like 10-30%/day IV will go even higher than it is now and I will gain that boost in IV/premium profit as well). Double-edged sword as if stock goes down or the it no longer trends then IV crush will make the pain even worse.

**Trade Ideas for CRSR**

* **Beginners**

* Purchase shares and set limit order to sell at a favorable price target. See above for analyst and insider price targets.

* **Advanced**

* Purchase as many round lot shares as you deem if stock price is under $35 or average in if more conservative
* When the stock rallies, sell covered calls at a strike above your cost basis and wait for Eagle Tree to unload shares to take profits. If Eagle Tree does not unload shares and your calls are ITM at expiration, then enjoy your profits and buy back on the next dip
* When the stock sells off, sell naked puts or put credit spreads and take profits on rallies
* Track chart and check moving averages for entries and exits
* Rinse and repeat until CRSR establishes support in the 40-50 range. Once this occurs, re-evaluate position
* Consider taking profits on half or all your shares if you see a more favorable exit during larger rallies  

**My Current Position**

* 200 shares @ 28.49 average cost basis
* 5 Put Credit Spreads for 7/16/21 32.5/27.5 for $1.65 average premium

Sit back and prepare yourselves for the lowest effort DD out there

For those of you who don't know, the marble EFT is the way to pick stocks when you just want to sit back and scratch your nuts. It's a gravitational algorithm where marbles are given ticker names, and what ticker lands twice in the top ten is picked for day trading the next day. Five maps are played each evening and if there are no winners than the day is taken off. 

**As of April 5th the current overall is 10.75%**

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BIG: A company poised for future growth  Hello again fellow degenerates, I hope today was as exciting for you all as it was for us $BIG investors. Today was a step in the right direction for Big Lots (ticker: $BIG). It is exciting see this underappreciated, undervalued company getting some attention around here. 

&#x200B;

[  ‚ÄúAsk not what Big Lots can do for you, Ask what you can do for Big Lots‚Äù](https://preview.redd.it/7rffuwimmx671.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae0ab7f9d8e0af26c053ce06abbffb1dce8042dd)

  

In the morning, $BIG announced that it had expanded its clothing line to include companies such as Reebok, One World, Como Vintage and others. To some this might have come as a surprise because the prevailing sentiment around here is that $BIG is a store that is due for extinction. These people will continue to be surprised as $BIG is a company that is preparing itself for future growth.

In the previous post we discussed Operation North Star and the company‚Äôs objectives for the future. This strategic transformation has three primary goals:

1. Drive profitable long-term growth
2. Fund the journey
3. Create long-term shareholder value

Let us now that a look at what the company has done in 2020 to advance this transformation:

* Grew Broyhill brand offerings to account for over $400 million of net sales in 2020;
* Grew net store count by four stores, which is the second consecutive year of net store growth;
* Developed curbside pickup capabilities for buy online pick up in store (BOPIS) orders;
* Partnered with Instacart and PICKUP to provide same-day delivery;
* Achieved an 82% favorable associate engagement rate (which is above the benchmark they set);
* **Increased customer satisfaction score by 600 bps to approximately 81%;**
* **Expanded e-commerce distribution network by implementing ship-from-store capabilities in 47 stores.**

&#x200B;

[ ‚ÄúSee that right there Johnny, that‚Äôs where $BIG is headed‚Äù ](https://preview.redd.it/nz923ajvmx671.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb346e0735e35d65ca04e92c8f354697580e1438)

  

$BIG has also set some important goals out for 2021:

¬∑ **Update the user interface of their e-commerce platform for easier online shopping; and** 

¬∑ **Invest in e-commerce analytics tools for better insights into customers‚Äô online shopping habits.** 

* (The company is aware that their e-commerce platform needs to be updated and has set this as one of their major objectives for 2021)
* Expand distribution network by opening two small-format distribution centers to enable efficient processing of bulky items and full-pallet shipments.
* Continue to grow store count.

TLDR: To the surprise of many $BIG has thrived and will continue to do so in 2021. The company is sitting on more cash on hand than it has ever had in its history. It has extensive plans for future growth and is well on its way to the goals it set out in 2019 under Operation North Star. 

*I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise, Please do your own research.*"

2021-06-23 00:44:44,wallstreetbets,Congratulations on owning a brk. A share
2021-06-23 02:18:57,wallstreetbets,Rigthio‚Ä¶ I only go as far as what I see on the post header.
2021-06-23 05:29:53,wallstreetbets,"Ape does not know how to click article, i get it ü§£"
2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"KISS Keep It Simple Stupid I have tried to tell you all before and I will give it one more shot. $BCRX, its so simple an ape like me can figure it out.  Its a drug company that makes rare disease drugs.  Do you know what that means?  That means 1 patient is over 400k in revenue in the US.

I wont get into specifics because I am trying to keep your attention.  Lets just say the disease sucks and the only treatment available was self injections üíâand you could die if untreated.  Now its a simple daily pill regimin, Orladeyo.  Sound it out.  Its what your wife's boyfriend gets.  

Did I mention they poached the specialized sales team, from their chief competition?  With such a small patient base and such high cost these are 1 on 1 relationships with the prescribing doctors and patients.  You don't think docs will be happy to drop more expensive treatments üíâand start switching some patients to cheaper daily pills at 425k a year and at least try all new patients on it as a standard of care moving forward?

Also, another drug worth a magnitude more cleared ph1 recently.  It went so well that the FDA said ph2 is for    üåàüß∏and your goals are exactly what you did in ph1 for ph3. For this disease currently patients have to take 2 costly medications and still need regular transfusions.  Thats hours at the hospital out of their lives weekly for too patients on current treatment.  Lets just say there were not many transfusions needed at the end of ph1.  Almost all transfusions ü©∏throughout the study went to a single patient who was quite sick at start and began on a low dose.  They didn't need them so much at the end. Insurance companies and patients will be salivating to stop repeated costly trips to the hospital. 

Oh and as they say, its a pipeline in a molecule.  It has about a dozen other potential uses.  Once approved for one thing only proof on concept trials needed for everything else.  One of which includes renal disease.

Bought this last Aug in the 3s its now in the 16süé∞.  You should have listened then.  Earnings will be crushed after the expectations have already been doubled. They tripled street expectations on the first full quarter of sales on Orladeyo. Doing this during COVID shows the strength of their sales team.  This was while also giving free medication to many patients while setting up with insurance companies.  Already enough cash on hand without any sales to get to late 2023.  This means no offerings should be coming as its essentialy a derisked bio on the rise.  Mark this post aug 2023 100 plus.  I am not a financial advisor of course.  That being said I have never been so confident about a stock in my life. Should get exciting again just before q2 earnings call around Aug 5.  Don't be late to the party Cinderellaüëóüë†.

I know you all are still on the short thing. So heres what I know.  Its around 20-22% of the float.  Volume has been dropping because no one is selling this thing. There is already a bit of liquidity issue for them.

You do what you want of course but this üíéüôåü¶ß is gonna be holding his bannanas and selling puts to üåàüêª for the next two years.

TLDR: $BCRX = üöÄüïëüöÄüöÄüïêüïêüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"

2021-06-23 02:29:20,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs my largest position.
Holding 8,000 shares and Jan 23 leaps. Will keep adding up to Q2 earnings in Aug.

Orladeyo that just got approved will drive the SP to $40+ but all the other drugs in the pipeline has the potential to drive it much higher.

It‚Äôs a longer term play with huge upside."
2021-06-22 23:18:39,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the DD. My DD site sees this at over 21.50 by fall.

2021-06-23 11:58:27,wallstreetbets,Its going to be hard to time outside of earnings.  Shares or leaps would be my suggestion.

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Comparing Tesla to Ford Stock. Tesla is far overrated Alright, I'm not making this long, so sorry for leaving out a whole transcripts worth of evidence and such. I'll just point this out. 

Ford has done a lot in the past twelve months to show it is still in the game.  First; new CEO (hooray!). Most notably turning it's most sold truck in America (the world) into the first (beating Tesla to it) EV version. And might I add, it looks like it's got some great things going for it. Plus one for not looking aesthetically stupid looking like the Cybertruck. You get a nice new throwback vehicle (Bronco). An electric ""Mustang"" (except it doesn't have a v8 and isn't a manual, but whatever). AND a game-changer of an affordable truck starting at $20,000 MSRP, hopefully bringing back the 20K-30K vehicle wars.

If Elon wasn't a tweeting meme, I gather the 'stonk' would come crashing down, just like the window in the Cybertruck reveal. 

That is all.

P.S. Don't bring up the plant top-secret project being moved to Mexico for production. Yes, it saddens me it's not Made In America^(tm)"

2021-06-22 22:55:53,wallstreetbets,"Counterpoints - Ford can only build 50k Mach e per year because they didn‚Äôt secure a battery supply. F150 will be the same story. Lots of demand, no batteries to build them. 

Ford just broke ground on their first battery factory, slated to open in 2026, will be able to supply 1/15th of their fleet. Hopelessly behind on battery production, to the tune of decades. 

Tesla has 5 battery production factories under construction, several of them already producing. 

Tesla has essentially zero debt (all convertible) and $20b COH. Iron fortress balance sheet. Ford has net debt of nearly $100b (?).

Ford needs to take $200b in write downs from zombie assets.

Ford needs to thread a very thin needle to survive the next decade."
2021-06-23 04:33:02,wallstreetbets,"I doubt there are many rednecks on here, though some Im sure. One major thing being overlooked is; brand loyalty. 

I always hear ppl talking about how their family has driven fords since Christ walked the Earth etc. Or GM or Toyota whatever. They tend to stay loyal. Ive owned several ford trucks but I'm not necessarily one of those types. I do like the Ford Lightning because it looks like an actual truck and not a artistic render like the cyber truck, but GM Sierra's 1500s are probably the sexiest trucks I've ever seen as far as function and comfort. 

Truth be told, Im not personally loyal to anyone except for, whoever has a truck setup to where I can charge the truck from a solar array ontop of my travel trailer is gonna have my business. Be it a backfeed plug on the bumper next to the 7 pin connector or something. That's really the number one thing I'm looking for in an electric truck personally so i dont have to sit at a charge station for 30 minutes, I can charge as I drive/park/boondock"
2021-06-22 22:40:33,wallstreetbets,"Ford isn‚Äôt a vehicle manufacturer, they are a vehicle assembler.  Third parties manufacture the parts that go into their vehicles.  Tesla, yes may be overvalued, but are 5 years ahead of Ford in the EV world.  Don‚Äôt expect the Ford EV truck to come in anywhere near 40K. They use that price to gain pre-sales, but it will be much much higher 

Fords value comes 5 years down the road.  At that time Tesla is already dominant"

Tesla is about to be king of a crowded market (for whatever that's worth)  Every major car manufacturer is bringing an EV to the table along with multiple New start ups. While Tesla will hold their lead and  ride brand recognition, they are a luxury brand and will find themselves trailing low end EVs who can under cut them on price. once the market is flooded with cheap EVs."

2021-06-22 22:23:02,wallstreetbets,I'll never invest in Ford no matter how good it looks solely because Henry Ford was butt buddies with hitler
2021-06-22 23:17:01,wallstreetbets,"The F150 is Ford's moneymaker and a lot of that money comes from fleet sales. If Ford sees a decrease in fleets, they are in trouble. Ram has been gaining ground in this regard. Does Lordstown pose a threat...I think so because the pricing of the Ford Lightning escalates quickly once you move from base trim.

The new Mach-E is ugly and should never had the mustang moniker attached to it. My blue oval loving friends hate it. So you better hope the younger crowd buys into it. Same thing for the Maverick. Utter crap styling.  No payload. Bed is atrocious. Might as well buy a cute ute.

If you snagged Ford during the last year, good for you. If you bought it 5 years ago and are still holding.... You're just happy to see that you'll soon break even. Also, is Ford getting tagged to the tune of $1.3 billion for the chicken tax ordeal? Or was that a hit piece?"

2021-06-22 22:50:44,wallstreetbets,"I work in the car industry as a project manager. Started at a Tier 1 plastic supplier in Europe, then moved to America and worked for VW Group of America. Now back at a tier 1 metal supplier. But when I was at that VW there was talks / rumors about them buying Tesla or certain aspects of their supply chains (This was 3 years ago **not saying this is happening!**). Reasons of these rumors and talks where all when VWGOA announced their new President (who came from Tesla) of NAR G4 division - which focuses on EV and build the Cross.

To the point, the biggest challenge Tesla faces as a car manufacturer. Is that they don‚Äôt have any dealerships centers and more importantly services centers like every other OEM. And the biggest challenge any EV car faces is the charging time compared to pumping gas (for long distance traveling ex. California to NY). Until charging stations are implemented throughout America (like gas stations), or battery swap centers (possible future ev gas station) or a super charger technology becomes realistic (30 mins full charge time or less -ideally 10 mins). Currently Tesla has a 20-25 mins for 150 miles and 1 hour - 70 mins for full charge. Not to mention you have to find these chargers location. (Easier in bigger cities than other American city‚Äôs. Which is not ideal for a cross country roadtrip) Tesla is way overvalued for what they actually bring to the table. Plus, I won‚Äôt be surprised if they have different plugs. And not a universal plug for these stations any OEM can use. Pretty sure Audi‚Äôs hyrbrids like the Q8 have a different plug shape or Wattage (I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that would be the case)

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I think Tesla is cool but until any OEM beats to market that type of infrastructure or faster technology / better battery. Tesla gonna get left in the dust. Realistic any OEM who has dealerships within almost every county in America. (As a foundation of a infrastructure) At least, can implement charging stations or a battery swap centers, faster throughout America than Tesla can."

I will suck Elon‚Äôs dick because Tesla mobile service will come to my driveway while I jerk off upstairs to thoughts of self driving robotaxis.

The most misinformed part of your hot take is how long it takes to charge. If 1-3 hours or less is your idea of realistic, you have about as much of a clue about electric vehicles as I do about earning money in the stock market.

Again, awesome points from a unique perspective!"
2021-06-23 00:11:04,wallstreetbets,Your info is so horribly wrong. I supercharged at an old 150kw Tesla supercharger this weekend. Full charge at that slow charger was 35 minutes. On a newer 250kw supercharger it would have been under 30 minutes. If I only needed 150 miles of range I could have charged that in 5-7 min since the charge rate starts so high and then tapers off to 50-60kw as you approach full charge.

We need all the batteries we can build. 200k per year starting mid 2023, I imagine these are already spoken for to fulfill F150 orders and expand Mach E. So possibly by calendar year 2024 Ford will be 1/40th electric at 250k EV units per year. 

Which is great. But Tesla is planning to build about 2.5m EVs in 2024, which yields auto revenue around $135b annually, excluding energy (which is intended to outpace auto revenue).

I am very comfortable owning Tesla stock :)"
2021-06-23 08:45:09,wallstreetbets,"Tesla owns about 60% of the global automotive grade battery supply (as of 2020). 

Everyone else gets to outbid each other for the remaining scraps. 


(Which is why all the other EVs are ‚Äúproduction limited‚Äù halo cars at 20k or 50k units per year - and Tesla churns out 500k, growing 50% yoy)

Imagine outsourcing the powertrain of your car to the lowest generic bidder and thinking that is smart.  It‚Äôs the only differentiator and the legacies are just buying off the shelf."

2021-06-22 22:43:16,wallstreetbets,"Tesla doesn‚Äôt trade as a car company, it trades as an energy company.

Sure you can compare them, but you can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúFord is worth more because they are better at making cars.‚Äù  Tesla couldn‚Äôt care less, they have huge battery facilities in Puerto Rico and elsewhere.

2021-06-23 17:04:35,wallstreetbets,"You're missing the point. The point is expected growth rate. Tesla is not an established traditional energy company with limited growth.

2021-06-22 23:02:35,wallstreetbets,"Ford took so long? How do you figure? They took the most popular selling truck of all time and converted it to electric before any other of the big car makers.

Basically, just focusing on a single factor like AWD in comparing price is not quite right."

2021-06-23 09:25:23,wallstreetbets,"Well I know people my age don't have a great opinion of Ford cars, because we had shitty a Taurus that crapped out on us all the time when we were younger. They (and other automakers) fought Tesla tooth and tail for their direct sales, which was more or less delaying EVs getting to market. 

So Ford has a bit of good will to get back. 

Now is the time though, because Tesla is shitting the bed by removing features and canceling products via tweets etc.

I wouldn't bet against Tesla or even really say they are overvalued (they own a huge network of charging stations, are going after the delivery truck market, solar and home batteries etc.) , but money in F (especially LEAPS) is super solid. 

Fords BlueCruise or whatever they call the auto driving feature is *curated* on the supported roads rather than the more pure AI approach of Tesla. To be honest, I could see it performing better, especially with Tesla messing around with their car's sensing equipment."
2021-06-23 17:50:32,wallstreetbets,You nailed it.  Tesla is everyones darling they cant let go.  People need to take their gains while they can imo.  The ev competition is about to get fierce.  7k difference price because if tax credits burys the cybertruck immediately imo.  Thats a huge gap

2021-06-23 02:12:21,wallstreetbets,"Tell this to anyone who's ever dealt with the nightmare of having their Tesla serviced, lol. ""Rich Rebuilds"" on YouTube is probably one of the biggest Tesla fanboys and maybe has owned more of them than any other individual, but if you watch his videos you'll soon realize that everything he does to fix Teslas involves grey market parts and risks not being able to use the supercharger network. That's what Tesla is missing, letting you or a local shop buy a replacement part and service the vehicle when something goes wrong. This doesn't need to be a dealership, just a service center."
2021-06-23 00:11:29,wallstreetbets,"Look I like Tesla I said it. And I hope they do succeed! And Tesla is Forsure in my opinion leading the EV race with certain technologies and patients. But they still lack the infrastructures of OEMs. Example, is services centers when your Tesla breaks down or needs service where you gonna bring it. You can keep sitting on the couch jerking off and wait for some one to pick it up and bring it back in a week. Not to mention, every OEM is making their versions of EV. It‚Äôs only matter of time one OEM beats Tesla in the race and is also well rounded with a infrastructure setup. (Dealerships and service centers) 


And the topic of charge time is a hot topic. With the simple fact of if you could charge your Tesla as fast as I could fill my car with gas. Their would be more people driving EV and more charging stations. Currently, i doubt anyone who owns a Tesla would want to take a cross country road trip with it."

Just saying shit on the internet to make you feel better about your investments is going to cause you to lose money.  Tesla hasnt come close to proving it can compete in the automotive space.  Can you say the same for Ford?  The cybertruck is much more expensive than the f150 l.  f150 is the number one selling truck in america.  FORD is beating tesla to market in 2022 regardless of what you say about production.  Fords debt is actually making them money read this: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/general/2013/04/05/fords-huge-debt-problem.aspx

ppl care about brand recognition, first to market, price, and most of all coming through with deadlines.  you talk a lot about teslas production but the dude has shown repeatedly he cant keep up with even modest demand.  ford is great at producing and has been i. this business longer than weve been alive.  i suggest you buy ford to hedge against tesla failing"

2021-06-23 17:37:30,wallstreetbets,Your right the risk is low but the upside is huge if you consider ford to beat tesla in the market which they are already soing with the electric f150.  they can bet their batteries from korea they dont need factories right away
2021-06-22 23:22:05,wallstreetbets,"I have a hard time seeing Ford taking the same path as Tesla has with regards to vehicle manufacturing. Tesla is creating a manufacturing process that results in very few parts relative to legacy auto manufacturers. The only parts they could use would be motors and battery‚Äôs. To use either of those would be Ford waving the white flag.

A future autonomous driving software though, probably."

2021-06-23 09:36:49,wallstreetbets,"Per ford ceo production will be limited for a year or two. Their plant can only put out about 80,000 units in a year at max. They would have to modify one of the gas f150 plants or build a new one to break 100,000. As far as a mil in a year, based on the scaling and not knowing how it will sell. Looking min 5 years, closer to 10 plus to hit that number."
2021-06-23 09:20:28,wallstreetbets,"Ok let‚Äôs forget Tesla for a minute. China has been producing EVs for years and has a much faster adoption rate than anywhere else on the planet. Tell me again how Ford is ahead of the curve by releasing an EV in 2021? 

You are missing my point, the real point is the manufacturing lines, debt and dead assets that all legacy auto makers have on their books is going to drag down their bottom line unless they get bailed out."

2021-06-23 02:23:18,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately your charge times are wrong. 

While it is true you do have to locate the superchargers, it is what it is in an emerging market. When the horse and cart was replaced by the automobile I'm sure people had heaps of complaints about the automobile at the time too. Looking for the superchargers is not very hard in comparison to maintaining an automobile during their inception period. 

As for dealerships and service centers, you need to crunch the numbers and actually think to yourself what is the value of a relationship with a customer vs the overhead costs involved. If Tesla is able to create a good enough product, the cars will just sell themselves. I mean look at Porsche cars, their brand and sports car heritage is so powerful, their 911 GT cars are sold out as soon as they are released. They actually don't need dealerships to sell those. The Dealerships are only there to sell the more run of the mill models like base 911, Caymans, Boxster, Macan etc. If you can get a product good enough it doesn't matter."

Also, I was pointing out that you didn't mention that the loan was nearly paid off,  but instead just threw out that ford has this $6B loan and somehow that's just as terrible as the $50B+ bailout GM had. Pretty disingenuous if you ask me."

2021-06-22 22:06:03,wallstreetbets,Holy fucking balls
2021-06-22 22:12:00,wallstreetbets,Damn son. I thought I was in hard with PRPL but you‚Äôre in way deeper than me. Good luck to us both!
2021-06-22 22:26:37,wallstreetbets,I think you were part of the last years crew too? If i recall there was 3 of you psychos that made me tendies from prpl. Which is why i dove dick in first today again.

2021-06-22 23:33:05,wallstreetbets,"Realistically, what do you see this run ending at? I‚Äôm holding $25 calls for 7/16 I‚Äôm hoping print tendies."
2021-06-22 23:46:43,wallstreetbets,If we don't have this much to spread around what do you suggest? Jan 2023 30c?
2021-06-22 23:47:19,wallstreetbets,"Congrats!

Here's hoping you're right about there still being time, because I jumped in today with about 1% of the amount of research I usually do.  I even bought before I realized your level of autism (who you are)."
2021-06-23 01:03:35,wallstreetbets,PRPL was oversold and had no fundamental reason for going below $26 let alone $25/sh. Time for the Purple Push and get this baby back to it's home above $30/sh.
2021-06-23 01:20:15,wallstreetbets,Loving these $PRPL YOLOs
2021-06-22 22:13:00,wallstreetbets,Why do you like this stock?

2021-06-22 22:19:54,wallstreetbets,"Naw, works as a crutch."
2021-06-22 22:06:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm not fucking around. Prpl for the win."

2021-06-22 22:29:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeah there were the 2 big dogs u/Dhsmatt2 and u/lurkingsince2006 , I was a smaller player but ended up pocketing 300k even with the great nurpling."
2021-06-23 07:46:07,wallstreetbets,I think we have a good enough entry for it to pay off bigly. And we're hedging with time which I feel good about. Don't have the theta clock ticking in my head now
2021-06-22 22:15:44,wallstreetbets,"Its great value, growing company, solid product, and has pulled back farther than I ever thought it would. It's a great buy at these prices with good upside and very little risk of downside. I believe the bottom is in. So it's asymetric imo. And it's sentimental, was my first big win on wsb."
2021-06-22 22:16:17,wallstreetbets,BECAUSE ITS THE FUCKING TRUTH
2021-06-22 23:00:59,wallstreetbets,Been watching this bish since $25. She moves slow and steady off low volume. Algos take the wheel. JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL üôåüôåüôåüôå

2021-06-23 06:42:00,wallstreetbets,Just hypothetical: How are you hedging against news driven shit that happens to individual companies?
2021-06-22 22:37:55,wallstreetbets,Yup! I remember! My friends and I made some good money following. When I saw lurkings post today I texted my friends and said its time ride prpl again. 90% of the people here dont know that the prpl OGs come in hard.
2021-06-22 22:21:59,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre mostly doing stock and Long call options?

2021-06-23 07:37:53,wallstreetbets,"Time mostly. That's the reason for the leaps and the shares. Just wait it out. But otherwise nothing. Could sell some covered calls but it'll be a drop in the bucket. Once the price rises I'll prob convert of of these to spreads, but for now it's all on the line."
2021-06-22 22:25:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this time. I thought the pull back was done when it dipped under 30, had short dated option and has to close them to let the down trend take it's course, so I lost some money. Trying to be more sensible this time to protect against the unexpected and give more time to be right. Being early is the same as being wrong."
2021-06-22 22:46:25,wallstreetbets,I think I‚Äôll look into purple more. Thanks for the post

2021-06-23 01:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Unpopular opinion, but Krispy Kreme donuts are trash tier. Gimme hole in the wall joint with an asian lady that has some 8 year old kid working the register any day."
2021-06-22 22:15:11,wallstreetbets,Only offering 26.7 million shares. Might be quite a cockfight for them. Their donuts are delicious.

2021-06-22 22:16:06,wallstreetbets,"Best donut that ever existed, hands down. Idgaf about dunkin or your local trendy mom and pop shop with bacon on their donut (though that is sexy now and then). The original glazed Krispy Kreme donut, especially while freshly made and warm, is the best fucking donut in the world. 

I will absolutely be participating in this $DNUT IPO, but they haven‚Äôt listed a date for us!"

Everybody talked about how you can't fuck up this one, but since last week it just keep going sideways. I'm not selling anything, but I am curious on what's the community have to say about this. 

Is it still too early for $UWMC to start the mooning since it doesn't have the popularity it needs or is it just already too late for the investment? 

I'm Just here to collect your thoughts. Only the future will tell us..."

2021-06-22 21:57:42,wallstreetbets,Its a long term buy.   Not much of up and down movement....
2021-06-22 21:56:24,wallstreetbets,If you invest in uwmc it should be for the .40 cents per year dividend in my opinion
2021-06-23 01:15:52,wallstreetbets,UWMC has gone up almost every day since May.  Small pullback is fine.
2021-06-23 02:15:55,wallstreetbets,wait until friday. expect no dip out of double digit. steady gains from then to august. then dividends. uwm is a very good company nonetheless
2021-06-23 02:16:19,wallstreetbets,UWMC was red several days in a row. Hopefully UWMC will be green tomorrow

2021-06-22 21:52:19,wallstreetbets,realistically tho i just feel it doesnt have the traction it needs/deserves in terms of an investment its def solid
2021-06-23 04:44:25,wallstreetbets,"UWMC has seen nice movement up since it‚Äôs low, some consolidation was probably needed. I think the Russell inclusion helps to provide some much needed volume."
2021-06-22 21:52:01,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs cyclical.  It‚Äôs not going bust. It‚Äôs just a top tick on what were insane mortgage volumes
2021-06-22 23:16:32,wallstreetbets,"Mat(the CEO) says he looks forward to the interest rates rising because guess what? UWMC is built for taking market share when they do. Refis are a drop in the bucket for them, they make their money on new and existing home sales through mortgage brokers and they believe they can and will catapult to the #1 mortgage originator (not refinancer) in the country in the coming year or two. Inventories are my only concern with rising prices on existing homes and new home builds stalled by inflation. That said, Mat has balls, seems to be aware of how to navigate the coming market place as stimulus ends and rates rise, and he is determined to be #1 within the next 2-3 years, so I'm in. Also Lumber is coming back to earth so I would expect new builds to start ticking up again soon. Will it moon tomorrow? Probably not but it might on any given earnings day with a big surprise beat, and the share buyback and dividends are nice bonuses in the meantime. This is not investment advice, just some retard's opinion."
2021-06-22 22:33:00,wallstreetbets,Cross my fingers
2021-06-22 23:53:07,wallstreetbets,"I think this ticker doesn't work for this sub. People will invest in what they know and millennials and zoomers don't know shit about real estate. 


So because it's loosing popularity it's probably a good investment. As soon as PLTR stopped being mentioned in this sub it started to recover. Probably same thing will happen to UWMC when people here forget about it institutions will start to pick it up."
2021-06-23 10:20:36,wallstreetbets,"I am holding long on this one, currently under valued based against competition. The books are what really sell it though. great revenue ect ect WSB doesnt like it because its not a meme shit stock"
2021-06-23 07:59:35,wallstreetbets,"With an MSR business, they essentially have the ""right"" to collect fees since they ""service"" mortgages. That means they'll collect payments, potentially put them through the foreclosure process and cover the costs (potentially make a profit), etc. So they would earn some sort of basis point on the outstanding of the principal of the mortgage.  
  
So the rights end when a mortgage is refinanced (which is what we witnessed in the falling interest rate environment). In essence, the income stream are actually less when rates are low, and longer when rates are rising. If you look back during the housing bubble, in 2007, MSRs could've been valued at as much as 6X annual fees. However, when the bubble burst, they were about 2X as much.  
  
It's very perplexing how this isn't getting priced in. The company even mentioned they're forecasting growth / stability in the coming quarters.

For the short-term view, there's also the Russell Index Addition on Friday, and short increased significantly WoW (about a 15% increase as of yesterday's close). It's becoming hard to borrow at some places, and I wouldn't be surprised if the borrow rate skyrockets in the coming days.  
  
Full disclosure: I'm long shares and calls in UWMC."
2021-06-22 22:19:18,wallstreetbets,Their history is remarkably stable despite being a company that makes money from the housing market. Can't bring myself to invest in them if only because it wont return much in the timeframe I care about.

Their money 20Q4 was mostly due to record refi volume, not greater spread capture. Refi‚Äôs have slowed and home prices are though the roof, thus their volume should be and is slowing. The recent run was due solely to the buyback plan, not increased business prospects. Not a great stock right now, IMHO"

2021-06-22 22:40:07,wallstreetbets,"Most of their revenue is purchase, not refi."

I bet one day this stock will be worth $50+.  For now, I'm buying the dip and holding"
2021-06-23 07:29:15,wallstreetbets,Have you bothered to read their quarterly earnings statements? 76% of their income in Q1 was refis.
2021-06-23 07:09:00,wallstreetbets,His point is he feels the refi‚Äôs will go away and uwmc will be hurt by that. I‚Äôm saying they won‚Äôt be hurt like rocket and others. They will still be profitable even when refi goes away.

2021-06-22 22:29:25,wallstreetbets,"There is an opioid crisis and just from my limited, but positive experience with using Cannabis based pain reliever for my husband rather than an opioid, there is room to grow this market. It will be at the expense of opioids. Opioids are different from other pain medications. Opioids go directly to the brain and then bind to opioid receptors. Opioids alter the receptors so you don't perceive pain.  
  
Many people get a high from opioids the first time they take it. If they continue to take it, the brain will eventually crave that high. Other pain medications go to the pain and attack the pain. That's why opioids are so addicting--it is altering something within your mind. Simply put: opioids tell your brain there is no pain; other painkillers go to the pain. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to being prescribed opioids and for extended periods of time. Patients who have used opioids for over two weeks should have a schedule set up by their doctor to wean them off--that is how addicting the prescription opioids are. In 2019, the CDC reported over 13,000 deaths from prescription opioids.   
  
In states with medical cannabis, there is almost a 20% drop in opioid prescriptions. I could find no reported deaths from CBD oil. This is an industry that is evolving and has the potential to positively impact those afflicted with pain.  I saw it firsthand with my husband."

Only posting because I'm a recent convert after my husband was hit in a crosswalk and drug 20 feet under the car. Opioids were prescribed and he was a nut--talked all night to friends who were not there. Gave him the dog's CBD and it made his pain manageable and gave him relief to rest without hallucinations. It was amazing. AND no addiction. I am a former never weed person. And I can't even touch the stuff without surgical gloves because I work for an airline.

Here is the content of the DD put together by u/working_choice_7785 (moderators-- I hope it's okay to share here):

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""**UPDATE market close 6/18**

Despite the Dow dumping more than 500 points, LZB held firm at the support of $35-36 and in fact gained a tiny bit day to day. People are asking for my position screenshot so here you go. Best of luck to everyone who's already jumped in. Spread the good word about LZB as far wide as you can. Let's make next week LZB week on Wall Street.

Hello everyone,

I just made an options play yesterday on LZB (La-Z-Boy) that I think is very exciting so I'll share it here.

I bought:

$35 call options for October '21

Current stock price is $36 so these calls at essentially At The Money.

TL;DR/Reasons

* **Market cap = $1.66B = Same as GME and AMC in January 2021.**
* **Down nearly 15% over the last 2 days despite earnings beat on all metrics simply due to current global supply chain issues.**
* **Now trading 33% below fair value of $53.39 as per Nasdaq.com**
* **Last time stock traded near current $36 support level was after last major dump on February 1. Stock recovered to $41 (10%+) by February 8 and hit $45 (20%+) by March 12.**
* **As per June 15 earnings report, orders are currently backlogged at record levels for all products due to record demand.**
* **Trailing 12 months P/E ratio = 14.31 = Now cheaper than furniture industry average of 17.67 for this iconic brand!**

Long version/full DD

After the 10 bagger+ successes of GME & AMC I think Reddit is ready for a new 10 bagger. I have looked long and hard for that opportunity and I think it is LZB. Why? This stock has everything Reddit needs!

1. **LZB has extremely low market cap so it is easy to trade up the ticker -** LZB market cap is about the same as GME and AMC in January of this year before the mega pumps in price! Even without Reddit involvement this stock is pretty much guaranteed to go up from here as per [Entrepreneur.com](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/374743) but if Redditors start buying this up this is EASILY the next ten bagger due to the low market cap.
2. **It is trading well below fair value after being dumped over the past 2 days -** [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) published an article yesterday saying the stock was trading 21% below value when it was trading at $42. Now it is at $36, the long-term support, which makes it 33% below fair value! Why did it dump? In their earnings call, they issued a warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short-term due to raw material price increases right now. However, they also said these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. So basically, the dump is a super overreaction as their earnings report came out the same day J Powell did his press conference and caused the whole market to dump.
3. **The stock will recover soon because it does this -** Because this stock has low market cap any news causes a dump that soon recovers. Simply looking at the chart over the past 6 months will show other such instances including the last major dump to this support level on February 1 and the subsequent recovery by 10%+ in only 8 days and a 20%+ recovery in just over a month after that.

4. [**Forbes.com**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenshoulberg/2021/06/15/la-z-boy-q4-proves-home-is-where-the-money-is/) **notes that LZB is the poster child for the boom in home furnishings sales** \- Some quotes for those that don't want to click through to the Forbes story -

>If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer, all you have to do is ask La-Z-Boy.  
By one measurement that the company uses, ‚Äúwritten same-store sales‚Äù for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%.

Their CEO noted the following in the earnings call (also covered at Forbes) -

>For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability at Joybird.  
Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead.

5. **LZB beat on all important metrics including EPS and revenue as per their June 15 earnings report** 

6. **And yet this iconic king of furniture brands is currently cheaper than the furniture industry average thanks to this dump**

&#x200B;

If Reddit gets interested in this low cap stock I expect it to go to the moon. I recommend getting in like I did. Best of luck and don't forget to buy one of these with your tendies""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Lastly, I want to add that the analysts covering LZB have all maintained and or raised their price targets into the 50s. The lowest price target is 46 which would still be a nice gain from where we are now.  

LZB has strong potential in the short and long term in my opinion. I have been a long time holder of Restoration Hardware, which has printed nice (the housing boom will continue to contribute to a boom in furniture sales and for a fantastic earnings beat, the drop in price was an overreaction, I think it will bounce. As always do your own DD and see you all on the damn moon!

Glad to see the trade is working out great for you so far. Let's hope more people sign-on. There is so much more upside from here. We're still sitting slightly south of 200 EMA and this stock can trade at least 30-35% past that whenever it is on an upswing like in March and May."

2021-06-22 23:55:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry, but what?

Gamestop didn't buy anything back. They sold shares.

Meanwhile you had these airline companies taking no interest business loans to ""keep their company afloat"" and wanted to use it to buy their own shares back because they didn't really need the loan. 

There's your difference."

2021-06-23 05:00:15,wallstreetbets,"And even if it were true, the reason a buyback for GME would be interesting is because it could increase the price to trigger the margin call for the shortsellers. 

The buyback that normally happens is to increase shareprice artificially and that is why this is normally illegal outside the US.

2021-06-23 08:45:46,wallstreetbets,Buybacks are a way of distributing wealth to shareholders. Buybacks have been criticized recently because corps like the airlines spent all their cash reserves on stock buybacks instead of saving for a rainy day then asked for government bailouts. Buybacks are fine depending on the financial context.
2021-06-23 08:49:26,wallstreetbets,"Buyback, share offering, surely it‚Äôs all the same"
2021-06-23 08:59:26,wallstreetbets,GameStop never took bailout money as far as I understand it
2021-06-23 09:03:35,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of it is that Boeing got immense money from the American tax payer with unneeded bailouts bc they legally bribe politicians w dinations and then still laid people off all while doing buybacks. It's easy to hate Boeing.

GameStop legit needed any bailouts to stay afloat and keep their employees employed, like those bailouts were intended to do. So in GameStop's situation, now that they are flush with cash, it's not hurting anyone but shortsellers who have been killing american companies for sport.

Boeing, and many other giant american companies, are like the richest person in the country asking for donations so they can take a vacation. GameStop is like that person who needed to start a GoFundMe to pay for cancer treatment. Two completely different situations."

People who hate any and all corporations will say Boeing is exploitative for buying back their stock. As I recall they used low interest loans thanks to the FED to do it.

Meme stocks have been a rallying point against Wall Street hedge funds (even though some hedge funds definitely made money of the short squeeze), so those same people will not just turn a blind eye to it but support it.

No corporation deserves unconditional support, but to say that corporations, banks, and investment firms are the cause of financial crashes as opposed to the federal government doesn't seem right to me. Occupy Wallstreet should have been Occupy D.C."

GME is moving to the russell 1000, and likely the S&P 500 if things stay as they are (instead of improving like new leadership and over a billion in capital can do) so I want to get as many shares as possible, and the panic buy high, panic sell low crowd can stay here.   


WSB is for fun with a few hundo, but a post comparing a company using a pandemic bailout to line their own pockets is different from a company selling shares ATM. Yes, GameStop did a by back 2 years ago but who the fuck cares right now.

Has GME ever asked bailouts for the government? If a bad economy ever hit the company really hard. Do you think the executives were planning on asking money to the gov, because they are strategic?

2021-06-23 16:29:17,wallstreetbets,They are creating new shares and selling them. This dilutes the investment of all current shareholders. But it‚Äôs great for the company.

2021-06-23 04:32:48,wallstreetbets,"No. As per most common ways to write bylaws (and what the actual law allows) these shares go to the unallocated pool. The company may may issue as many as X shares, and often issues fewer than X. The issuer shares are what people own. Some portion of X are allocated to an option pool for everyone form regular employees to the CEO. The rest are unallocated. It is far easier to allocate unallocated shares than it is to get everyone to agree to make new shares (note the subtle difference here). 

Few buybacks (if any, but I don‚Äôt have extensive knowledge here) destroy shares. Because that (like making new ones) is harder than just allocating  them out of or putting them into the unallocated pool."

Almost every other company does it the other way around; sell when things are bad/prices low, and buy back when prices are high, as a *reward* for their shareholders for buying in when things weren't great.

But you have point on reselling digital videogames. But have any publishers or platform agreed to it yet? Because modern games have ties and limitations due to them being tied to accounts and such."

Amazon hosts over 300 million active customer accounts worldwide, including 200 million paid Prime members. It also owns Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's largest cloud infrastructure platform, and the third-largest digital advertising platform in the United States.

Wish went public last December at $24 per share, but its stock dropped below its IPO price on the first trading day and is now only worth about $13. Amazon's stock rallied about 30% over the past 12 months, and has stayed roughly flat since Wish's public debut.

Wish market capital 8.36B

Amazon market capital 1.77T 

$WISH is so fucking undervalued."

so probably a lot of those users are a consequence of aggressive promotional tactics like that.  thing is, their app kinda sucks.  the item descriptions and images are not useful, for more expensive technical items (i was looking at drones and power tools and such).  they just dont give you enough information to determine if you're actually getting what youre looking for.  and this might be forgivable, but they have a bot / fake reviewers problem (which could also be contributing to the high user count).  so basically every purchase is a little bit of a gamble.  things are so cheap on there that maybe people will be okay waiting a week for their thing, only to find out its a cheap knock off that doesnt work.  ""oh well, it was 30 bucks"" but personally, i prefer to know exactly what im getting, so ill be sticking to amazon for now."

2021-06-22 21:34:46,wallstreetbets,"It looks like WSBs has been heavily infiltrated by bots or hedges trying to prop up WISH and CLOV...

They have been operating at a loss for the last 2 years (understandable in 2021) but they were at almost 250M loss in the first quarter of 2020 (before the pandemic)... [https://ir.wish.com/node/7041/pdf](https://ir.wish.com/node/7041/pdf)

I would bet that they are trying to boost the price so they dilute the market and recover losses on operations.

2021-06-23 03:05:54,wallstreetbets,it's not not a pyramid scheme
2021-06-23 05:28:36,wallstreetbets,CNHI  CEO talking about his company and agricultural equipment  on Jim Cramer show commented that his company is getting some of their technology from Nikola.  They are planning on Hydrogen electric equipment and getting the tech from NKLA. I am sure there is more to come from this.

Now Nikola $NKLA has high short volume that not letting Nikola go back to $50s . 
I just keep buying every weeks 50-100 shares a week"
2021-06-22 23:38:44,wallstreetbets,"you sound blithely unaware of the many shortcomings and red flags of this company.  you also seem to think that there is some mystery boogey man bad guy who has just unfairly targeted NKLA bc they don't want to see hydrogen succeed.   you also seem to believe that hydrogen from water is just a simple fairy tale process that happens spontaneously.  it's nonsense.  the company was enjoying a meteoric ride and was valued at more than Ford without ever having delivered a vehicle!  so the public was more than ready to support NKLA's efforts.

things shifted a bit when all the lies, and there were many, were made public.  public opinion also dwindled when they made up a consumer truck on photoshop and then applied a bunch of outrageous stats to it and then GM walked away from the deal and the truck was never mentioned again.  of course, we all know about the semi truck rolling down a hill, but did you know trevor claimed in april of 2019 to have 3.5 megawatts of solar panels on the company's roof?  they had 0.  he's on video saying this.  he also said at NKLA World 2019 that the company was producing 1,000 kg hydrogen/day.  Do you know how much they were actually making?  0.   i won't bore you with the many other lies. but they're available if you care to do a little research....

but, forget all that.  say you don't mind investing in a company that has 0 revenue, lies to its investors repeatedly, and whose ex-chairman is being investigated by the SEC and DOJ.  for their business model to work they need 1) hydrogen at a competitive cost and 2) massive infrastructure of hydrogen refueling stations.  TLDR, they aren't close on either of these critical end points.  their business plan stipulated a hydrogen cost of $2.47/kg, but according to motortrends's article reviewing the Mirai in CA, they paid $16.70/kg for hydrogen in Jan of this year.  Sooooo, not close.  To point #2, NKLA said they were going to start production of their hydrogen refueling stations in 2018 with stations opening in 2019.  Care to guess how many stations they've built ... no, not built... how many have they even started to build??  0... in 2021.  ZERO.  Not only that, even if they did have them built, they'd have no hydrogen to put in them bc NKLA, at last check, still wasn't producing hydrogen!  Who is going to build these stations, and more importantly, who is going to pay for them????!

the bottom line is hydrogen as a fuel source for vehicles is an old concept.  it's been tried since the 60s.  it's just not an efficient fuel source for vehicles, at least until some genius devises a better method to harvest, store, and dispense hydrogen.  if that does happen, my guess is it won't be trevor's brother making the discovery.  oh yeah i forgot to mention, NKLA thought trevor's brother was a wise hire for their director of hydrogen production and infrastructure, despite having no education or experience commiserate with such an important position.  (oh what a shock, looks like his tenure ended there about the same time his bro got canned after this all became public knowledge.  So in almost 6 years at the position, the director of hydrogen production and infrastructure produced literally 0 hydrogen, and built literally 0 hydrogen refueling stations, yet kept his job that entire time and prob walked away with all his stock.)

but yeah, the people who don't believe in NKLA are just oil tycoons or part of the BEV reddit army.  yeah.  no justifiable concerns with NKLA itself to warrant the dissent.  sure."

2021-06-23 00:43:09,wallstreetbets,"BEVs are from 1884. They also had they fair share of failures throughout the last century. Plus, infrastructure based exclusively on BEVs is not the answer. There are plenty of good names validating Nikola's hydrogen business model, others trying to copy it, there are even plans to build an entire city powered by hydrogen in Japan. So hydrogen is here to stay. In terms of fueling stations, you can't build them years ahead of the trucks being on the road, short term there are plenty of better things to spend money on. Hydrogen cost will also drop substantially and the fueling is being standardised, meaning, there will be more fueling stations that you can use than just Nikola's.

You guys can deny it all you want, Nikola is happening and actual semi truck production is about to start, so hang on to your hats."
2021-06-22 20:47:07,wallstreetbets,Then why are you on WSB? LOL. All these picks are now garbage. GME was great when we started when Burry was calling out at $5 under his filings.

2021-06-22 20:10:31,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't matter a house built on lies will surely not stand, it's the same reason aptera is doomed even with a decent concept far to much baggage and skeletons in the closest too much illusion magic, and too much of this kind of stuff to garner good publicity to float the stock until they can pull the golden parachutes."
2021-06-22 20:10:58,wallstreetbets,He made a bunch of money off of Trevor Miltons scam so I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him
2021-06-23 13:23:28,wallstreetbets,"Why would the entire industry switch over to hydrogen?

Hydrogen fueling stations and hydrogen manufacturing stations are EXPENSIVE to build. Hydrogen is inherently dangerous to handle and transport.

 Electricity is plentiful, and existing gas stations can be retrofitted to charging stations for cheap.

Class 8 trucks can pull over and do a battery swap like a fork truck does.  No need to sit and recharge."

Look I get it everyone wants the troop of apes to whirlwind there stock but that's not what wsb is about"
2021-06-22 20:09:23,wallstreetbets,Think Hydrogen is to niche personally. And subsidies like this are not feasible long term. Or on a national level. EV is too easy. Power is everywhere. Just the basic costs/logistics of Hydrogen make it completely uncompetitive. If I remember correctly. Toyota even went so far as to build some Hydrogen stations in California back when they were first developing the Mirai. But cost and lack of use doomed the project.
2021-06-23 18:34:19,wallstreetbets,"It costs about 2 million to build a hydrogen fuel station. How is that cost effective?

It costs a fraction of that to add charging infrastructure to a gas station."

2021-06-22 20:18:59,wallstreetbets,"I think automakers would prefer fuel cells very much over lithium battery packs. They have to absorb the cost of batteries in the car. Compared to a much more familiar territory for manufacturers. Of building a car, and someone else provides the fuel. Jaguar and Land Rover are basically jokes in the car world. Toyota on the other hand. Is a massively funded, highly respected company. Who's played with Hydrogen for decades.  Its still just comes down to production/distribution  of Hydrogen thats the real problem. If someone came along with an answer to the logistics problem. Toyota would start cranking out Hydrogen cars in no time."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CRSR - A true potential multi-bagger? Hello everyone, below is my in depth analysis of $CRSR.

**My Personal Price Target:** \~$72

My analysis will consist of the following categorically: Fundamental Approach, Technical Approach, Comparable Metrics, and Competitive Advantages/Disadvantages

1.) Fundamental Approach (Valuation):

What is Corsair? Corsair is an American computer peripherals/hardware company which has emerged as a leader in gaming gear. They have products which range from computer components all the way to streaming equipment.

They have a product line which consists of the following:

**Gaming keyboards and mice**

**Headsets and audio products**

**Streaming Products**

**Performance Controllers**

**PSUs, Cooling Products, and Cases**

**Memory Products**

**Pre-built and Custom-Built Gaming PCs**

CAGR (2019-2023):

https://preview.redd.it/ggt0l9h97w671.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac1e860feed8abbfd1a1cfc81049a2c94002ea40

&#x200B;

**Bullish Case:** PC gaming/streaming will grow further into the next 5 years. Orders for gaming PC's and products within the sector will come in at relatively high growth rates at a continued rate. 2020 was a good year, but there is more to come.

**Bearish Case**: PC gaming will lose steam in the next few years. Gross margins become gradually worse for $CRSR due to further investment into R&D and marketing to increased competition in the market.

First and foremost, I wanted to include a DCF model which expresses my case on $CRSR stock. The DCF backs up the notion that it is *incredibly* undervalued and under-appreciated in the market.

&#x200B;

[Financial Assumptions](https://preview.redd.it/kxgv8d3c7w671.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=654b5379d3772cb910db7b499dcd0b4f93a33677)

&#x200B;

[Valuation\/Sensitivity Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/jn5alm0e7w671.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=0360aa955a029b659d628a67598a6cfdbe1ee17b)

SI:

[Indicates SI is at an all time high - why?](https://preview.redd.it/dlbn23zi7w671.png?width=2830&format=png&auto=webp&s=e73a96dd27d709aee6aaf0094f02c556eb887711)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[High SI ratio](https://preview.redd.it/rivf3m9l7w671.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=dac05b5da6381375463d1ae1b1b1a60cce677a2e)

&#x200B;

$CRSR price is susceptible to falling more in the near to short term due to the sheer number of individuals who have high level short positions. However, entry remains attractive around these levels due to very strong fundamentals.

2.) Technical Approach:

[Monthly Technical Indicators Signal \\""Buy\\""](https://preview.redd.it/73pq686o7w671.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b6018cb3ceeff5453d1631304d1c2f1ea03f020)

&#x200B;

[The Strong Support Line appears to be $29.58 in the last 6 months.](https://preview.redd.it/tx9gq92u7w671.png?width=2820&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f7c4afd771cf9a453551a81e8bbe70c0ebd7987)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3.) Comparable Metrics to Competitors:

[$CRSR appears to be undervalued heavily on a majority of metrics](https://preview.redd.it/qvccj36v7w671.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=93263b2f1190f5b42087b67e22532a2040587fcc)

&#x200B;

As side note- I believer Corsair has significantly better products than Turtle Beach. I believe the future growth for $CRSR outweighs Turtle Beach by a wide margin.

My belief is that eventually, $CRSR will take much of Logitechs market share, or at the bare minimum catch up to them. Corsair has quite comparable products to Logitech, and the margin between the two should not be as large as it is.

4.) Competitive Advantages/Disadvantages:

Advantages:

* New Product Lines enabling more growth
* Products not limited to the gaming industry, but used in office spaces pending reopening
* Leader for affordable, yet high quality streaming gear
* Recurring revenue business model
* Product domination in many important categories

https://preview.redd.it/4fe6uxmw7w671.png?width=2592&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ad8f6a027b3794626b9ded84aa1f2759d06731d

&#x200B;

Disadvantages:

* Profit margins need to be maintained and improved
* Facing high level short sellers in the short term
* Threat of new entrants/new competition long term
* Lack of TRUE economic MOATS on products

Overall, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages here. It seems that the long side of this trade is far more sensible than the contrary. We face short term pressure, but the long term guidance/ current under valuation outweighs the pressure.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As always, good luck to all and happy investing :)

2021-06-22 21:06:27,wallstreetbets,"You can say they have no MOAT but Elgato dominates the streaming field in almost monopolistic fashion.  I'm not just talking about twitch, youtube gaming is growing incredibly fast, vloggers in general use Elgato products... oh and also your favorite OnlyFans girl.  YOu think OF ain't growing? HAH!  Pricing this as a ""value"" stock with no growth at current PE and Forward PE is laughable.  Also they dominate RAZERs garbage low quality products that break before a year."
2021-06-22 20:51:46,wallstreetbets,I love seeing crsr DD makes me hard
2021-06-22 20:27:01,wallstreetbets,Their products are pretty solid. I'm in. Let's go
2021-06-22 21:43:35,wallstreetbets,"Ive been in it for a while now, i love CRSR as a share holder and as a customer, great business and currently trading at an amazing price, BUY now & HOLD for the long term"
2021-06-22 22:33:15,wallstreetbets,"I don't know how much of your argument that I agree with but we do have the same conclusion.  My thesis is a bit simpler and less dependent on a comparison to Logitech.  Their PE and forward PE is significantly lower than competitors; their revenue growth is huge; and market cap is literally multiples lower than it should be.

72 is conservative.  I'm looking for 80-100 within 12 months."

Then, DCAd to 33, love the stock‚Ä¶

Premium was dry but I figured I‚Äôd wheel ‚Ä¶ sold CCs‚Ä¶.

got stuck short calls when it had a nice jump last week after the last DDs and couldn‚Äôt unload my bags

I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm not alone, and still short calls so when it jumps from this DD we‚Äôll all still be sitting here holding"
2021-06-22 21:17:22,wallstreetbets,What are the near term catalysts that can make OTM calls profitable?
2021-06-22 21:30:29,wallstreetbets,Looks solid company!
2021-06-22 21:36:53,wallstreetbets,I'm all in.
2021-06-22 21:51:54,wallstreetbets,"$crsr definitely deserves to be at least in the triple digits.
It's crazy that it's only valued at $32"
2021-06-22 22:01:41,wallstreetbets,I'll add it to my IRA.  Too many stocks to add lately...
2021-06-22 22:03:46,wallstreetbets,$72 maybe 3 years from now
2021-06-22 22:34:22,wallstreetbets,I like the stock. Want to build to 1k shares.

2021-06-22 22:50:14,wallstreetbets,CRSR to the moon
2021-06-22 23:18:41,wallstreetbets,This is correct
2021-06-23 02:08:21,wallstreetbets,Corsair will literally beat Apple on market cap mark this comment.
2021-06-23 02:57:51,wallstreetbets,Really wish they had weekly options. Only really play crsr on the week of the monthly expiry
2021-06-22 23:11:19,wallstreetbets,"I love your DD and CRSR. I do think we have some institutions (EagleTree), which unfortunately hold a significant amount of the share float, who won‚Äôt hesitate to dump their shares as soon as this thing gets legs. Need them to exit their positions before this stock will go anywhere I feel like.

700 shares here. Holding for the long term."
2021-06-22 23:40:54,wallstreetbets,How low will it go before it starts rising?
2021-06-23 00:08:19,wallstreetbets,"A 2x PT? Wrong sub, sir."
2021-06-23 03:09:18,wallstreetbets,Those eagle tree fuckers can sell for as long as they want. I ain‚Äôt going fucking nowhere!
2021-06-23 04:03:17,wallstreetbets,Can anyone explain te me how these short positions are valid in good companies? Like who is short CRSR at any decent amount to keep it down? Please explain.
2021-06-23 13:20:58,wallstreetbets,"Corsair definitely hinting at DDR5 release news next week.

MILLIONS of new builds in coming years, packed with Corsair products."
2021-06-22 20:20:51,wallstreetbets,"Sigh, it's already well-known this stock is undervalued and we tried to bring attention to the masses two weeks ago, but insiders (fact) and Eagle Tree (probably) just keep dumping on retail."
2021-06-23 03:45:48,wallstreetbets,"Account 2 months old and first seen in WSB 3 weeks ago should be ringing alarm bells for you retards. Theres three huge flaws in the DD which OP failed to mention. 

1/ Eagletree who own around 60% of CRSR are obligated to liquidate their position to around 10% over the coming years. That means as soon as CRSR has any sort of spike or gain, you can bet these fuckers are just going to pass bags to you. 

2/ The ""Technical Analysis"" is literally a crayon line. That's it. OP clearly ate half the pack of crayolas before attempting to look at any chart. Before the huge pump and dump (which is definitely having a negative sentiment to this stock) CRSR got rejected at the 20, 50 and 100 EMA three times. Now I don't know about you, but to me, that's a huge red flag indicating more downside.

3/ CRSR gave forward guidance that the last two quarters of this year we're going to be worse than the first two as things re-open and people move back away from gaming to doing things like going out more. This could be a nothing burger, but still warrants a mention.

If you're thinking, CRSR was at 42 just a week ago, it'll go back, ask yourself why it even went to 42 with zero catalysts and has dumped ever since back to it's lows. 

If you're thinking, CRSR was at 42 just a week ago, it'll go back, ask yourself why it even went to 42 with zero catalysts and has dumped ever since back to its lows. 

Now more than ever, do your own DD and don't rely on bag holders trying to pass them to you."
2021-06-23 02:58:57,wallstreetbets,"Leave a few weeks in between pumps and dumps, please"
2021-06-23 03:05:28,wallstreetbets,Great DD OP! What are your thoughts on the selling pressure from the major shareholder?
2021-06-23 09:02:17,wallstreetbets,Aren't some of the institutional investors in corsair obliged to sell? Meaning there is constant selling pressure that makes it difficult for it to go up?
2021-06-22 21:38:38,wallstreetbets,Overvalued...
2021-06-22 23:18:01,wallstreetbets,"Corsair can suck my fat retard ape cock. I bought a bundle from them.. headset, keyboard, mouse - all 3 in 1 box for 100 USD. TWO of the three items inside the box did not work brand new. The reality is Corsair makes garbage products and makes sales through deceptive use of RBG"
2021-06-22 22:59:15,wallstreetbets,Eagletree gonna screw you. Read the filings.
2021-06-22 21:21:50,wallstreetbets,Really solid point. Thanks for the feedback.
2021-06-23 06:38:32,wallstreetbets,Well it's not like Corsairs keyboards or headphones are high quality either... they just slap RGB on all of their stuff hahaha
2021-06-23 10:23:58,wallstreetbets,Are there any numbers on elgato revenue?
2021-06-23 00:39:48,wallstreetbets,Good luck. I‚Äôm guessing there will be another spike in price in the next few days and that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm gonna cash out on my CRSR positions.
2021-06-22 20:36:27,wallstreetbets,"Love crsr, but eagletree is still dumping shares. It will moon when that ends, but calls are risky as fuck until that time"

2021-06-22 23:29:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm you but sold CSPS at 35 and 32.5.  
Both ITM now.

2021-06-22 21:33:50,wallstreetbets,"They are doing a live presentation on the morning of June 29th, sounds like it might be the DDR5?"
2021-06-22 23:03:09,wallstreetbets, 80% return annualized is still pretty good
2021-06-22 23:54:48,wallstreetbets,"I agree, holding 250 rn. However, et‚Äôs effect on the share price should dilute as they sell off and expand the size of the float though. I just get more bullish on this stock. Can‚Äôt help it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2021-06-22 20:30:29,wallstreetbets,Don't let the short term noise alter the long term picture
2021-06-23 08:04:05,wallstreetbets,"If I were pessimistic about $CRSR, these points may have been valid to bring up.

It more so seems that you are upset at something, maybe the world.. Not sure..

1.) Eagletree is by no stretch of the imagination ""obligated"" to sell their position in Corsair. If there is a sudden spike in the share price, sure, they may sell parts of their position- would you sell? However, with growth expectations like Corsair, you can bet your balls they will want to maintain a majority stake.

&#x200B;

2.) Technical analysis- I covered the main technical indicators that people use. Sure, I am not going to spend three hours analyzing every little candlestick, but would love to see your version of so called ""technical analysis"" üòÇ

&#x200B;

3.) I gave my input on the direction I see pc gaming going in the forward. Anybody is obligated to their own opinion."
2021-06-23 10:26:59,wallstreetbets,"1) Do you have any proof or source about ET being obligated to reduce ownership?

Guess no, because it's just wrong"
2021-06-23 11:36:43,wallstreetbets,The catalyst is DDR5. Corsair may be first to market and that‚Äôs going to inspire millions of new builds loaded with their products. They may announce it at the event next week.
2021-06-22 22:15:03,wallstreetbets,A lot of gaming tournaments are opening back up because we are through the pandemic. There looks to be a ton scheduled with a bunch of hype and support. This will help sales remain as high as they were in 2020 imo
2021-06-22 22:19:40,wallstreetbets,Care to link it? Did not copy a single thing on this post except for a product line description from the Corsair site. Lols.
2021-06-22 22:21:08,wallstreetbets,Care to elaborate?
2021-06-23 01:01:55,wallstreetbets,"this is true, and the stock price reflects it. Go buy a Corsair product and tell me i am wrong."
2021-06-23 06:47:14,wallstreetbets,">they just slap RGB on all their stuff

Isn‚Äôt that a sign of quality? What sort of quality craftsman doesn‚Äôt throw rgb into every crevice?"
2021-06-23 06:41:42,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs PROVOCATIVE it GETS THE PEOPLE GOING
2021-06-23 08:58:29,wallstreetbets,I have two corsair mechanical keyboards and I like them just as much as my custom wasd.  What are you on about?
2021-06-22 20:58:21,wallstreetbets,CRSR is turning my diamond balls blue.
2021-06-22 21:15:50,wallstreetbets,When will they finish dumping?
2021-06-22 22:05:53,wallstreetbets,They could be done for the year or for awhile at least. They barley have majority control in the company any more and I'm guess they are going to want to keep that. I personally don't see them selling off like they did on the last run up but it is a valid thing to mention.
2021-06-23 01:16:57,wallstreetbets,That's crazy.. crsr is basically my entire net worth üòÑüçÜ
2021-06-23 00:23:30,wallstreetbets,"bummer for the 32.5 with all these DDs!

i sold 35c 8/20, guess depends on how much you got for em but i dont think those'll get assigned. too pricey to buy back if bumps now"
2021-06-23 11:30:18,wallstreetbets,Hmm. Maybe. I'll hold off.
2021-06-23 08:27:51,wallstreetbets,"You can't just take the positives and call it DD. It's just confirmation bias. If I were doing a real DD I'd want to know the good and the bad so I can weigh up the risks appropriately.
I like CRSR, what I hate is retards trying to pump something because they're bag holding. It's just so funny to see nothing on CRSR for a few months, then a huge spike to 42 and back down to 31 then as if by magic loads of CRSR posts start popping up. 
What's your position? You've not made it obvious in the main post."

I don't think you are aware of what DD even is. You probably heard it on a reddit thread and use that as your main argument when in opposition of something.

There is both the objective good and bad on this post, you are seeing what you want to see. I have owned $CRSR since public inception with an AVG around 15 dollars a share and LEAPS. I am very profitable on this position. There is no bag holding or anything going on- it's me spreading the word on a position which I think can double, triple, or even quadruple in time."

We have no clue but it'll be interesting to see. I'm long on CRSR and have lots of optimism in them them going to $50 in the near term even if eagle tree completely divests.

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My Rite Aid YOLO Plan Heading into the Scheduled Earings Report Due Out Before the Market Open on Thursday, June 24, 2021 OK, so today (June 22, 2021) the minions of the billionaire hedge fund FUD machine were very busy trying to beat down the Rite Aid's share price will less than 48 hours left before the release of Q1 earnings.

* Deutsche Bank started the day of cutting its price target on Rite Aid from $27 to $18, but keeping a HOLD rating on the $RAD stock.
* This was followed by Zacks lowering its rating on RAD from HOLD to SELL, while maintainnig a price target of $22 per share. (Now why would you tell people to sell when the price target you are promoting is 10% higher than the current share price? IDK. That's some fucked up logic that defies reason.)

That type of BS attack from the short-seller playbook really pissed me off.

So here is my YOLO position and I am going to surf the wave right into earnings. Rite Aid's stock price may crash or it may soar, but I'm holding this position heading into earnings and will let the fates have their way with me:

* 10 call options July 16th - $12 strike
* 400 call options July 16th - $28 strke
* 20 call options Jan 21st 2022 - $12 strike
* 12 call options Jan 20th 2023 - $12 strke
* 10 call options Jan 20th 2023 - $15 strike

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PSLV now is the biggest buyer on earth &#x200B;

Since the start of the Silver movement  in late January 2021, the Sprott closed-end fund PSLV has now purchased +58 million oz of silver bullion, increasing from approximately the fund's holdings from 90 million oz (Jan 2021) to the recent total of over 148 million oz (see graph below).

This was made possible by a [new shelf offering issued on March 2nd, 2021](https://silverseek.com/article/sprott-physical-silver-trust-pslv-files-new-shelf-offering-3-billion) to purchase $3 billion worth of silver bullion. In addition, Sprott PSLV has a prior shelf offering also that they were completing. Combined, Sprott PSLV had enough firepower to acquire roughly 120+ million oz of silver at current market prices around $25 to $27 per oz.

Based on the 58 million oz already acquired year to date, Sprott PSLV should have sufficient firepower to purchase another 60+ million oz still, based on the currently active shelf offerings. Given ongoing demand trends, it is extremely likely that¬†Sprott will complete that shelf offering during 2021 and issue a new shelf offering, probably for another $3 billion in value, so that they can continue their rampage of buying the equivalent of 1/6th of the global annual new line silver mining supply.

That was not a typo. Let's cover how much they are buying one more time.

Sprott PSLV has been buying approximately 1 out of every 6 ozs of silver mined so far in 2021.

This unprecedented buying is causing massive supply imbalances in the silver market. Sprott PSLV has purchased so many 1,000 oz silver bars in North America, that they recently had to open a sub-custodian agreement in London (with Brink's) so that they can acquire 1,000 oz bars in London, store them temporarily there until those silver bullion bars can be transported to Sprott vaults in Canada.

But nah no challengers, camaros, mustangs etc.; if you‚Äôre going to put it on the line you deserve something a tad more ‚Äúclassy with the HP‚Äù. And I agree Lambo‚Äôs are WAAAAAY overrated and actually drive like crap!! And their interior.. üí©just looks and feels ‚Äúcheap‚Äù as in old as vinyl and painted vinyl for effect. Lol. Plus have you ever seen or heard of a Lamborghini or McLaren actually able to be a daily driver? That‚Äôs what happens with hand built cars! They require ridiculous maintenance. Like an old Harley. You have to tighten up everything after a ride. And don‚Äôt get me started on Ferrari‚Äôs. Absolutely a joke! Having to be ‚Äúapproved‚Äù (contractually!, yes it‚Äôs true!) to buy one or sell.  SMH

And 2% is very accurate for returns!! IDK why people think traders are doing 30% etc.; sure occasionally you‚Äôll get a nice chunk.  But for perspective today on 1 stock scalped 5x for a couple grand and yes costing in all $80k.. it really does take $ to make $!! The larger returns are typically on longs. I can tell you I have several that are well into 300-400% but again it‚Äôs been a decade on some longer on others yet a couple months on a few! 

No I‚Äôm not bragging just stating what every REAL trader here knows!! Yet, a very patient and well executed trader can easily make $500 daily with much less."

Not even comparing to peers you take current revenue, add cash on hand and you've got a value of 5bn, no multiples. So that's our theoretical downside, which we saw at around 8, also that was a strong rejection and it bounced hard proving our assumption. Our upside is huge because peers are valued much higher and with the current market sentiment, everyone is giving WISH a thumbs up. I say 200% because that's the ATH which should be more achievable now than ever before. THAT is the speculative part, though it's not hard to conclude that it's a very safe bet with very solid potential return."

Ok so we all know the many reasons AMD is going to go absolutely nuts once the $XLNX merger gets through regulatory approval. For those of you who are in the stock or considering a position I want to point out something I haven‚Äôt heard discussed.

After finally hiring a CEO Pat Gelsinger‚Äôs BIG announcement was that Intel would re-enter the fab business. At a glance it may seem like so what? Well the reason Pat is focusing investor and media attention on their fab business is he knows they have lost and will not regain competitive advantage over AMD anytime soon. He has to set the stage for investors to buy Intel for the future potential in Fab because he knows soon they will drop the stock like hot garbage as AMD takes away not some but the majority of the high end computing revenue.

I personally believe between Data Center, GPU, Notebook, Desktop, Consoles, Cell Phone, Automotive and 5G $AMD will be $300-$400 in the next few years. Buy leaps or shares and enjoy the ride.

Not financial advice."
2021-06-22 21:24:31,wallstreetbets,"Totally on point. There was another really good post on this sub yesterday or the day before that talked about how big money is betting on AMD to blow past $90 once the merger is approved. 7/16 call volumes were the highest they've ever been.

While Nvidia is arguably the leader in graphics cards, AMD is rolling out their own line which will be very competitive! AMD could be a major player during and  beyond the current graphics card shortage! Lisa Su has this company on the fast track to make the stock worth hundreds of dollars in the next few years. Just check out AMD's past 5 year chart! It's poised to take off and not look back!"

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CRSR Gaming isn't playing games - Real Value in a Meme Stock Hello, fellow apes. This sub has been bringing up one of my favorite stocks right now, **CRSR**, which although undervalued by almost any metric (the street target is sitting at about $47 - right at ATH and 50% upside) yet has been trading flat in the low 30s range. I want to talk about why it stayed so steady, why this makes it the PERFECT opportunity for entry (especially on leaps- low IV on the contracts, but short-term theta is a killer).

&#x200B;

**Background:** Since CRSR IPO'd in 2020, it has done nothing but surprise investors. Posting its first profitable year, increasing revenues, and paying off debt. Not to mention they threw a few acquisitions in there to further diversify the business. Originally investors were amazed, which caused over a 200% rally in share price.

**Why it's Flat:** Since then, the market has been too worried about the vaccines and reopening efforts hurting their sales. But as we have all probably realized over the past year and a half -  gaming, streaming, and building computers AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE. If anything there are more consumers interested than ever before. CRSR has also taken steps to expand its business and establish itself as one of the biggest sponsors in streaming. Think of Nike or Red Bull - but for Esports. By growing their sponsored gamer teams, they attract the next generation of gamers and consumers who want to have the same products as their favorite gamers - the same way you still buy Jordans.

**Factors for Moon:** The most obvious is the fundamental undervaluation for CRSR. While most stocks keep pushing higher, CRSR has not seen love for months, even after posting great earnings at the beginning of May. While AMD has begun to rally and NVDA hits new ATH, people fail to realize that as they grow so does CRSR. What happens when NVDA or AMD comes out with a new product people buy? They get some CRSR accessories and peripherals to go with their new devices. The market is failing to see the amazing opportunity right in front of it.

**Let us not forget the 22% short interest ratio, which is why the rally last week couldn't hold. The rally also had 20x the average daily volume, if the market begins to realize CRSRs potential soon that type of volume will be normal, and so will a price between $45-$58 (my own targets from DCF model built).**

Yet again, what do I know - I'm a retarded finance student (how did I even get to college) and I eat crayons. Therefore this is not financial advice.

**TLDR;** I believe CRSR is insanely undervalued and it's only a matter of time before it takes off.

&#x200B;

This is my first public DD, I enjoyed writing it, I hope you all enjoy it and let me know what your thoughts. Excited to discuss it down below!

[Position: 19 7\/16 40c at .54 each and 5 7\/16 35c at 1.18 each, I know I'm poor.](https://preview.redd.it/z0q3hoe1uv671.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed57fa4ddc620c9b1d78e4d07f34008fd73ccd3f)

&#x200B;

**EDIT: There's a lot of talk about Eagletree's ownership of CRSR and how that's holding it down but as far as I can tell this is all a rumor. If you look through their Investor Rights Agreement SEC Filing, all that is specified is they remain in control of certain things unless they own less than 3% of common stock, but there is no requirement for them to ever sell any stake. Everything they have a say in keeps CRSR in check and honestly betters the company, but that's about it. You can read more directly from the SEC filing here:**

2021-06-23 00:01:25,wallstreetbets,"CRSR is a take over candidate. A great buy out would come from another meme stock GME. GME's recent cash infusion and market cap could swallow up CRSR at 5 billion easy. They would increase revenues by 40 percent year over year. GME can sell the CRSR equipment physically in stores. 

Another company that can buyout CRSR is Dell Technologies. Dell bought out Alienware 2 decades ago to get into the gaming market. Dell has the cash and the market cap to make this happen and not even be 10 percent of market cap it would come in at 6-7 percent. 

With increasing revenues in a hot market in gaming, esports, etc. It just makes sense that these two companies should make an offer for the company. 2 billion in revenue with a 2.5 multiplier is a no-brainer for a takeout."

https://preview.redd.it/fuw1kmlgrv671.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cb1eb78676d3b3aab9bb604b70c47e7c3e144ba

# Intro

Since reaching a high of $74 in March, $DKNG ü¶ç has tumbled to a current share price of $50. I believe this represents an incredible opportunity to get in on a stock ticker with a proven track record of making huge gains. I missed DKNG's initial runup in 2020 because I was skeptical of each new ATH, but last week's Hindenburg report got me taking another look at the company and I love what I see. Now, one week later, I've finally finished my DD and am ready to present it to the class.

**Sit down for your weekly shit and get ready, this DD is a fucking deep dive.**

# TL;DR:

* Analyst 12 month target is $68.85.
* IV is 50 (1% percentile rank), so options are incredibly cheap.
* Revenue is through the roof and growing fast.
* Customer acquisition has been extremely successful.
* Short interest actually *fell* after the Hindenburg report.
* The market hasn't fully priced in some major legalizations that could be coming soon.
* Investors know DraftKings isn't going to stay at this valuation for long, so they consider it on sale.
* Cathie Wood BTFD and are you really going to second guess the bull queen?

# An Overview of DraftKings

Before I start, I'd like to point out that Investopedia has a page on how daily fantasy sites work that I highly recommend.

https://preview.redd.it/d87mp52cnv671.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f57feef548f8f946901c2e061d14ce467574fe

DraftKings started as a daily fantasy sports app. If sports betting is illegal in your state, you can't place a bet on whether the Packers will beat the over. But, through DraftKings, you *can* select players from the Packers for a temporary fantasy football team and then play that team in tournaments for money. This is because most states consider fantasy sports a game of skill and not gambling. But, basically, it's a loophole that allows a roundabout form of sports betting.

In 2018 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal sports wagering ban, and that same year DraftKings released DraftKings Sportsbook, which allows users to place sports bets through an app in states where online betting is legal. The company is looking to leverage first-mover advantage and name recognition to become the predominant betting company in the United States by capitalizing on the mobile market. DraftKings Sportsbook isn't only available through the app, though. They also already have retail locations in states like New York and Mississippi - where retail betting is legal but online isn't.

https://preview.redd.it/jtzsm9bfnv671.jpg?width=988&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00d619228b01dacd782b2c92c104a48e85b00872

The DraftKings U.I. is easy to use, and the fact that it's on your mobile phone creates a disconnect in the user from the actual cost of gambling. It's the same reason Robinhood was able to create a retail investing revolution - the human brain is not good at fully weighing the risks of gambling when it's just numbers on a screen as opposed to money in your hand. Same reason casinos use chips - it provides a mental separation between the gambler and his money. Except this mental separation is about ten times as large.

Warren Buffet famously said ""Never invest in a business you cannot understand."" In other words, invest in what you know. There's a reason he bought Dairy Queen after all. Personally, I have been using DraftKings for daily fantasy for a few years now, ever since a fantasy football league mate turned me onto it. Since then, almost every single one of my leaguemates uses DraftKings during the fall/winter. If online betting were legal in our state, I'm sure we'd all be using their sportsbook too. **Think about it, DraftKings (and FanDuel) have essentially created a gateway app to a gambling addiction via daily fantasy sports.**

# The Legalization Of Betting

This is huge. Since 1992 sports betting has been illegal in most of the U.S. But after the Supreme Court's ruling in May 2018:

* 13 states have legalized online betting.
* 7 others legalized betting at retail locations, but have yet to legalize online betting.
* 8 more states are expected to finalize legalization of some form of sports betting in 2021.

**That means over half the country has legalized betting in just three years.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lni8l92nnv671.jpg?width=963&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae473c90c52910946d0ba5a549bd61557eb34770

Still, the future of sports gambling will be heavily influenced by three states which have yet to legalize - Florida, Texas, and California. These three states alone represent over 27% of the entire U.S. population.

1. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a new compact with the Seminole Tribe that would bring statewide mobile wagering, although betting won't begin until at least mid October. It is anticipated that DraftKings will be able to at least secure a pari-mutuel contract with the Seminole.
2. Texas had a sports betting bill submitted this year, but it likely won't be considered until the 2022 legislative session. There are no legal casinos in Texas, so it's expected that Texan gambling would include an online component.
3. The L.A. Times reported last month that California voters will decide on November's 2022 ballot whether to allow sports betting. It's uncertain if the measure will tether betting to tribal casinos like some other states, or whether it will also allow online wagers.

# Revenue, Earnings, and Outlook

**DraftKings is experiencing rapid revenue growth, with one ARK analyst stating the firm believes sports betting revenues will be 18x by 2025.** Q1 2021 earnings were 312m, an incredible *252.69%* year-over-year increase. That revenue figure beat analyst projections by a thicc fucking 32%.

Below is a chart comparing DKNG with some other growth stocks that were hot in 2020. Keep in mind these operate in a variety of industries and sectors, so you shouldn't just make a 1:1 comparison. But it can help provide some context for DKNG's metrics.

&#x200B;

||Projected 2022 Revenue|Projected 2022 Earnings Per Share|P/E (12M FWD)|Cash Per Share|Total Debt to Equity|LFCF|Market Cap|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|DKNG|1.62B|(1.61)|(25.97)|7.03|57.18|82.89M|20.11B|
|ZM|4B|4.72|79.38|15.92|2.45|1.45B|109.89B|
|SNAP|5.77B|0.66|150.02|1.68|150.74|327.59M|94.31B|
|ABNB|6.96B|0.30|(321.45)|10.8|77.77|N/A|92.10B|
|SPOT|11.24B|(0.38)|(219.34)|15.6|57.09|512.38M|46.37B|
|ETSY|2.73B|4.45|42.87|13.11|198.02|587.08M|21.56B|
|FTCH|2.86B|(0.20)|(123.55)|3.51|N/A|2.78M|18.13B|
|PENN|5.87B|2.41|31.5|13.23|405.85|626.92M|11.9B|

&#x200B;

If EPS didn't immediately jump out at you then you're right at home on WallStreetBets. Despite incredible revenue growth, DKNG has had abysmal EPS showings. In Q1 2021, they reported a loss of $0.87 per share, which was *60%* worse than analyst estimates.

So how does this company that boasts massive revenue growth manage to lose so much money?Advertising and customer acquisition costs. *Eilers & Krejcik Gaming* estimated similar company FanDuel's spends about $68 per daily fantasy sports customer acquired. However, they also estimated that FanDuel made $100 *per season* off each acquired customer. So the upfront cost is big, but the profit margin is about 47% the first year *and then 100% each season after that*.

DraftKings is competing against FanDuel and Barstool Sportsbook to become the industry leader in the new world of online betting, so the customer acquisition cost of sportsbook gamblers is likely at least twice as much. But DKNG *has* to be aggressive to immediately establish themselves as the premier sportsbook among new gamblers, and being aggressive means spending money. So far - it's been very successful.

https://preview.redd.it/7kiby2sxnv671.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dce1d5cedfbe14e31f93d838c67c3317ec35889

**In Q1 2021, Monthly Unique Payers (MUPs) increased 114% year-over-year**, which was about a 60% larger growth rate than projected. This means the aggressive approach is working; and while it costs a lot to acquire a user, once you have them you have them for years. Unlike costs such as website upkeep, user acquisition can be scaled back eventually, which means DraftKings is expected to translate their massive revenue into monster earnings by decade's end. For now, it's a great sign that the company is locking people into a lifetime gambling addiction.

# Limiting Factors

**Hindeburg Report:**

https://preview.redd.it/1vogba03pv671.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4de5b03f7b048e0c956728876baa56cffb99a8bc

Let's finally get the big flaming blimp in the room out of the way. On 6/15/2021, Hindenburg Research published a reasearch note titled, ""DraftKings -  A $21 Billion SPAC Betting It Can Hide Its Black Market Operations."" Hindenburg's most notable allegation is that SBTech, a Bulgarian company that merged with DraftKings as part of it's SPAC process, generates roughly half their (SBTech's) revenue from markets where gambling is banned.

I can't believe this even requires addressing. SBTech's revenue accounts for a tiny portion of DraftKings' total operations. Who gives a fuck about this? Certainly not investors. Besides the fact that Hindenburg's allegations are poorly (read: not at all) sourced, DKNG has seen it's stock price soar because of U.S. legalization, not because of SBTech's operations.

Additionally, Hindenburg states that insider selling is a bearish sign. Fuck off. The stock rose over 300% in 2020, every corporation on the planet would have insiders who take profit after a run up like that. News flash - insiders selling for massive gains isn't a bad thing.

[If you want to read a more complete takedown of the Hidenburg allegations, I'd recomment this post.](https://nr.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o15i7b/an_investigation_hindenburg_research_dkng/)

**The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act**

https://preview.redd.it/xnat3yv6pv671.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfa62cc33a6afb4db682a819e01bed72bb687f04

In 1988, the United States passed a federal law to govern Native American casinos and such, marking the first federal gaming structure. Since the federal ban on sports betting was struck down in 2018, many states have been hesitant to upset their tribal lobbies by legalizing online betting. And some legislators (whether true or only claimed) believe that legalizing online betting would violate the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA).

Tribes have successfully lobbied in several states to limit sports betting to their established retail casinos. As somebody who lives in one of these states, I feel confident saying that this does not adequately service consumer demand. So it's almost a given that some states will expand their laws at some point to allow online betting. *How many* states is a big question.

A lot of analysts that I've seen write/speak about the coming widespread legalization of betting don't seem to fully understand the legal framework that could still limit DraftKings' expansion. The best case scenario may be for betting to be once again challenged in court - this time either going after the IGRA or filing an anti-trust lawsuit against the tribes.

I personally think DraftKings will have online betting available in the majority of states by the end of the decade, but it is *not* a given like many analysts believe. Just because betting is legalized doesn't mean DraftKings Sportsbook will be legal.

# Analysts and Investors Love DKNG

Use some common fucking sense - this generation loves to gamble. You're literally reading this on a subreddit devoted to betting. The big market investors know this and are getting in early for when every other male between the ages of 25 and 60 is spending 5% of their paycheck on March Madness and Football parlays.

https://preview.redd.it/31a9kj6spv671.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=8052b6bf69e9b73e89aa455b7bf52c709d6d6a6f

Here's a direct quote from an ARK Invest analyst:

>When we first started looking at the online sports betting space, the realization we came to is this is a supply and demand issue in that there is definitely a ton of consumer demand but the supply has been held up by regulation; and I would just add there that regulation is starting to favor more and more online sports betting. So when you look at it as just a supply and demand issue this is definitely still very much the early days.  
>  
>This \[past\] year was absolutely disastrous for sports. You had the cancellation of tournaments, you had shortened seasons. But what we actually saw was an enormous growth in online sports betting... \[The\] 18 billion \[dollars in total bets handled\] breaks down to around 1 billion in total revenue for 2020. **We expect that to almost 18x, in terms of - we're going to go from 1 billion in revenue in 2020 to almost 18 billion in revenue by 2025.**

Investors know that while customer acquisition cost is high, it's an upfront payment you make in order to acquire a lifetime customer in a high revenue industry. **If you think full legalization will bring a lot of new customers, wait until 2030 - when today's teenagers will have real jobs and start betting their paychecks on the bourgeoning e-sports scene.** I know that seems like a long time away, *but* the market won't wait until 2030 to start pricing that in.

https://preview.redd.it/f52ayiltqv671.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0cca98572260a87c6410769747bfe749f692bca

Speaking of which, what exactly is the market pricing in right now? Based on my projections, the current market cap is pricing in 7.5B in revenue, max. **So if investors reach a consensus that aggressive analysts like ARK are right and revenue will grow to 18B, a market cap of 50B would make more sense. That's $125 a share, or a 250% increase.**

So why has the price fallen 34% since March? The most likely answers are two factors:

1. Profit taking after the huge runup in 2020.
2. The giant miss on Q1 2021 earnings.

While the earnings miss likely scared away some investors who were hoping for a profitable business within the next few years, most are in it for the long haul. I know that if I was long on shares, I frankly wouldn't give a single shit about the earnings. I like to see the company being aggressive and spending money to dominate a giant growth industry from the go - especially when acquisition has been so incredibly successful. That should mean huge profits in the next decade.

This stock seems to have fantastic support around the level it's at now. Granted, it did kiss $40 in May, but it rebounded back to $55 within two weeks. It should be telling that Mama Cathie bought another 870k shares the same day as the Hindenburg dip, and ARKK alone has added about 10M shares in total since March. **Growth minded investors consider DKNG on sale right now.**

https://preview.redd.it/6kwsennzqv671.png?width=1729&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd58282aff34b87e387800692c1e1a0dd9827fc3

""Bu - but what about the short seller report? Aren't there a bunch of investors driving the price down after Hindenburg's research?"" Nope. Luckily for you, I paid $600 for an ORTEX subscription so I can give you the inside scoop on shorting.

**ORTEX estimates that short interest has actually fallen since the Hindenburg report.** Yes, you read that right. Short Interest before the report was estimated at 7.86%. Now it's estimated at 7.36%. That's almost a 10% decrease in shorting. Thanks, Hindenshit; you morons.

# Plays, Position and Price Targets

**There's three plays that make sense to me:**

1. Options are cheap, so you could choose something medium dated to capitalize on football season hype. 10/15 $60c are trading at $2.90 with a lot of open interest. Sell when the price hits $70 again and you should get at least a quad-bagger. Take note though, there's no guarantee football hype will be enough to drive the price above your break even point. If you felt really risky, 10/15 $80c are $0.85. If the price hits $70 before the theta decay hits too hard (like, next month), you could potentially make 10x.
2. My personal play is LEAPS. 1/20/2023 $60c are $11.55. You've got plenty of time to let the stock consolidate and rally again. This option leaves time for several big catalysts to pop the price - such as new legalizations, football season, March Madness, and revenue growth. A share price of $100 should net you a 500% return (maybe a lot more depending on how soon it happens).
3. Shares are a great option here. It mitigates you from most of the risk in this play. Set it and forget it. Come back in 2025 and find that your shares are worth three times as much.

**Position**:

275 1/20/2023 $60c

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$POSH The grossly undervalued resale company TLDR:

* High SI - 4.33 million shares are shorted worth $194m and 28% of the float
* Low float of 15.5 million shares
* Low, low volume - 10 day avg volume is 520k, days to cover is 8.32
* Share lock up expiration on July 12th could serve as a major catalyst for stock
* Strong fundamentals - Ask your wives and girlfriends if they use POSH
* Consumer behavior in millennials and Gen Z favors second hand items which will grow the resale market to $64 billion by 2024
* Depop was recently acquired by Etsy for $1.6 billion. Depop was valued at 23 price to sales vs POSH which is currently at 12 price to sales

\--------------------------------------

There are several short squeeze plays out there but its has been a lot of fun. Reddit has changed the game and has brought shorts to their knees through perseverance and true retardation. Now it is great that Reddit has moved stocks and that the actual company has been given a second chance at life due to the frenzy. But what is even better is buying a growing company that will be able to take advantage of the changing consumer behaviors of Gen Z. I.E. Posh Mark

Now I have been bullish on POSH for several months after I read some very good DD on WSB and then speaking with my younger family members who absolutely love the app.  Now I know that most of you  are male, millennials and virgins which are not exactly the key Poshmark demographic. But I can almost guarantee if you speak with the younger generation you will find there is a deep love for the app and that the average user spends more than 27 minutes a day on it.

&#x200B;

**Fundamentals**

There are several key macro factors that play into the Poshmark story.

First, more and more Gen Zs are entering the workforce and are rapidly gaining spending power and they are also influencing their parents buying behaviors with 85% of parents saying their children influence their purchases according to 2019 National Retail Federation survey. Furthermore, a study by Bain found that 60% of Gen Z's consumer behavior is influenced by reducing their environmental footprint and is a top reason they gravitate to resale companies. They are also driven by purchasing goods at discounted prices.

Second, they are the largest player in a growing market space. The second hand/ resale market is expected to grow to over $64 billion by 2024 just in the U.S. and is expected to grow at a 39% annual rate between now and then.  Poshmark currently operates in the US, Canada, and Australia. They have international expansion in mind meaning they have not even scratched the surface of the total addressable market.

Third, the shift towards social commerce. For you that don't use the app, it feels like a social media app that allows you to shop for goods. This keeps buyer and sellers addicted to the platform and is why the time spent on the app is over 27 minutes per day per user. The average per instagram user is 30 minutes. The social media feel of the app also provides current and future opportunities to provide a platform for influencers to market within that app, which is a large driver of consumption with Gen Z.

Fourth, POSH runs an asset light business model where they provide a platform to bring sellers and buyers together for a fee. Now this is important fro several reasons but the most important point is that their model is extremely scalable. POSH is a market place that does not hold inventory. This model requires little to no large capital expenditures when expanding into different countries or adding products on the platform like pet, home-goods, and baby products. This gives them a competitive advantage over competitors like Thread Up.

**Valuation**

Depop was recently acquired to by Etsy for $1.6 billion. In 2020 Depop had $70 million in sales from 30 million users in 150 countries. They were valued at 23 price to sales multiple

Vinted another reselling app was just valued at $4.5 billion with a 13 country and 45 million user base in the most recent funding round

POSH had 262 million in sales in 2020 and is currently valued at 12 price to sales ratio. They have operations in 3 countries with about 6.5 million active users. They also have about 15% market shares of the resale market with $1.1 billion of gross merchandise value.

What does this mean? It is evident that POSH has a more loyal valuable user base because they are able to monetize their users more effectively with each active user contributing $40 to the top line vs Depop which only earns $2.33 of revenue from each active buyer. POSH has only penetrated 3 countries leaving hundreds of million users yet to be reached.

Just comparing the price to sales of POSH and Depop, POSH should be trading at least 2x higher. There are other factors like future growth in the US and internationally

**The stock and technicals**

Now that stock IPO'd at over $100 and was quickly shorted into oblivion and bottomed five months later at $33. It has recovered since then but still has a short % over over 28%.

The float on POSH is about 15 million and the SI is about 4.33 million shares according to Ortex and has been growing ever since the IPO. The cost to borrow has been slowly creeping up to 3.66%. The utilization rate has been above 80% for the past week and hit 100% last week meaning there are very few shares left to short.

There were 3mm shares short when the stock bottomed last at $33 last month. The stock is currently trading at $45 so there are likely several shorts underwater.

The volume is super low on this stock with 520k shares on average traded over the past two weeks. This leaves the days to cover ratio at 8.3. This is also puts the shorts in a bad position where they are unable to close out their positions without sending the stock flying. To expand on this point any buying pressure or positive catalyst will send the stock flying as well.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2we61cuqgv671.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4d8e2b82981144f3852b3c64b6c0fae74dd709a

&#x200B;

**The catalyst**

Currently since the volume is so low they cant close their shorts without significant price movement to the upside. What they are banking on is a large chunk of newly available shares to close their positions after the share lockup expiration on July 12th. This could serve as the catalyst for the stock to jump higher if insiders do not sell. The stock will jump as the short sellers will have to purchase shares from the existing low float and volume to close.

Personally, I do not believe insiders will sell at these levels for two reasons.

One, the macro trends in consumer behavior are favorable to their business model. If POSH can maintain their current market share of around 15% and the market for resale goods hits $64 billion in three years POSH could easily hit over $1.5 billion in yearly sales by 2024. If you were to apply a price to sales of 6 which half of the current P/S  you would have a market cap of 9 billion and this does not even include sales from the established market of Canada and growing market of Australia or any other market they decide to move into. So why would I sell my shares today if it will be worth at least 3 times more in 3 years?

Second, their stock IPOd at $42 and jumped to over $100. The stock is only trading at $45. If i knew that someone was willing to pay over $100 six months prior why would I sell in the 40s. This is similar to what happend to Doordash which jumped 14% on their lock up expiration.

The POSH chart also looks very similar to LMND pre lock up. LMND ran from 60 to 181 after their lock up expiration

Overall, POSH is in a solid position to take advantage of changing consumer behaviors and will easily be a 3 bagger if not more in three years.

In the short term, the July 60c are trading around .45 This stock could easily rise to $65 or 70 if there is any sort of positive catalyst or reddit induced buying pressure. POSH announced a partnership with Snapchat that shot the stock up 50% in two weeks. If it were to go to $65 by July exp it would be a 10 bagger. The stock might jump that high if insiders do not sell their shares which I believe is the likely scenario or another positive announcement. 

Position 6000+ shares and some July 60c and Aug 70c

2021-06-23 14:07:43,wallstreetbets,"Who the fuck cares if it pops next week or a year from now?

Stop being so frail to gains. It doesn't matter when/why it goes up if you know it's undervalued anyway.

If you buy now , and it meme shots next week, then you sell, and buy on the comedown again, because you know the stock is a long-term winner anyway. 

What is the point of discouraging a sharp rise? Pride of not being a ""meme stock""?

We're all here to make money. Take your ego somewhere else.

This isn't just to you, but it's to every single person who keeps saying this on WSB and BB_Stock subreddit. It's getting annoying. Enjoy the gains."

If they had an issue they could have messaged me privately or down voted. 

What are you accomplishing by referring to 'Indian scammers' besides trying to add fuel to the fire and some might even say racism. What would race have to do with someone cussing? 
By the by I'm not Indian, nor a scammer. If others can view their opinions in peace why can I not? Again, I ask you who started this? Message that individual."

2021-06-22 21:56:20,wallstreetbets,"52-week high is $32.48 per share, set back in January of this year.

Following a positive earnings result for Q1 on Thursday, this stock is ready to retest that level."
2021-06-22 21:59:23,wallstreetbets,Just to show you how Scared and Desperate Shorts are. They have put out two Hit Piece Articles all within this last 24hrs of earnings. None with valid reasons for down grades or sells. One gives a $18 price target from DB and the other $22 with a sell rating from Zack's.
2021-06-22 22:02:16,wallstreetbets,"I know you are talking more about SI and TA, but I am curious of your thoughts on the fundamentals. I don‚Äôt like their incredible amount of debt, but I do like their insane revenue totals. Do you think RAD will be profitable either this year or next?"
2021-06-22 23:22:22,wallstreetbets,So‚Ä¶what do I do? Shares? Options?
2021-06-22 22:13:39,wallstreetbets,RAD's fundamentals are more than sound. RAD has  debt covenants that require them to pay down debt anytime they hold over $200 million in cash. RAD just paid back the last of their 2023 debt just this past May. So they have no debt due until 2025. Also do you realize that they only have 3.2 billion in actual debt and the other 3 billion is lease obligations. RAD makes 24 Billion dollars in revenue annually. Check that against  McDonald's or a few other large Corporations. So RAD can generate over $440 million a year in Free Cash Flow. Now that's without COVID-19 vaccine dollars. We are talking pre COVID. So I don't see why you would think that their debt isn't manageable.
2021-06-23 00:37:32,wallstreetbets,"Call Options 30 Days out is less risky, but if you buy RAD shares straight up you take away from the float. Shorts can't cover as it is. So they have to cover at some point. If RAD spikes. Because Shorts are trapped and the new SEC short rules. If we don't sell.  They can't cover."
2021-06-22 20:30:11,wallstreetbets,"Oh coarse I do. RAD is right at their 50 Day and 200 moving Day averages. But that's also deceiving. RAD was only pushed back under their 200 day ave by Short attacks. All within the last 5 Days and after breaking back over their 200 Day average. More importantly RAD has been under Short attacks since hitting $32 early this year. $32 was new 52 week high for them. That is nowhere close to their high 5 years ago at $180. The RSI is around 35 and RAD is still up on their 6th month and 1yr chart line. This is another stock with a GME style run potential, before their management issued more GME shares. Shorts are already trapped. The only thing Shorts can do now is short RAD More or Cover. For every $10 move up in price will cost Shorts  over $160 million. I'm telling you that they are desperate."

2021-06-22 20:41:22,wallstreetbets,"Anyone considering buying WISH really should go to the site and test shop for a while. Search on expensive things you know well; my test was PC components (CPUs, graphics cards, power supplies, etc). I found that nearly every such listing on there was being sold by an outright scammer (video cards in quantity at half retail by 0-feedback sellers ) or dropshipper (everything 2x the cost of Amazon / Newegg, meaning you buy from them at double retail, they drop-ship you a ""gift"" from another retailer).

The site is full of flim-flam artists. They've had years to solve these problems, and haven't. This is not how a business (which is currently not profitable) develops itself into a bright, profitable future with a rising stock price.

There are better short-term plays. This one will blow up in your face."

Knowing that out of the 5200 comments here, a solid five hundred of them is just about WISH with nothing tangible. We get it, it went up 22% in a week. There's always another stock that will do that next week. 

There's actually an *entire* site dedicated to positive reinforcement, it's called stocktwits.

Zoom out to a 20 year chart of the S&P 500. It's absolutely frightening where we are at and this is 100% a blow-off top we are experiencing. We will selloff to under 200 before rising to maybe the 250 range for SPY.

2021-06-23 01:53:32,wallstreetbets,"HOLD MUH BEER AUTIST, $PBR YOLO!!!!!

Yo, this one might move up pretty significantly over the next week or two.  

Price of gas is going up, inflation is kicking in a bit, all commodities and precious metals are going through the roof, and we're above some pretty big Wall Street trades that happened recently. 

On 6/2/2021 someone exchanged 15mil shares @ $11.11 (make a wish! someone @ Paris Hilton) in one shot.

On 6/8/2021 someone exchanged 14.9mil shares in one shot @ $11.71.

On 6/9/2021 someone exchanged 12mil shares in one shot @ $11.78.

Currently, we're above all those levels after about 3 weeks of sideways movement, and that could be a very bullish indicator. 

We also have a bullish cross over with the 4EMA and 8EMA on the daily chart.  

The only real resistance we have currently is the $12 level.  If it can break and close above $12 tomorrow 6/23/2021 or by the end of the week, I think we're in for a parabolic move up to at least $16.80 as that's the next major resistance level.  We'll catch some resistance @ $15 as it's a major level, but, there's nothing from stopping this thing from moving up beyond 15 besides computers selling at that level.  

So, WSB, HOLD MUH BEER! I'm going to YOLO on $PBR. 

If you're looking for a cheep options trade, the July 16th $13 calls or $12.50 calls will set you free. I'm currently in the $13 calls myself.  If you wanted to, you could go a little further out and get the Sept 17th $13 calls @ .49 cents if you wanted to play through earnings on 7/29/2021 and not have to worry so much about Theta decay.  But, hey, it's your money.  

In closing HOLD MUH BEER! YOLO ON $PBR!!!"

In 10 years when your whore of an Army slut wife is whining at you that she's out of Yuengling and she can't get her boyfriend to buy another case while you're paying $3 / minute on a sat phone to talk to her from 9000 miles away, and are about 20 minutes from having an explosive go off on your best friend's face, you'll look back fondly on the Drill Instructor fondling you because you were so cut and such a good boy following orders as the best moment of your life."

Go to church on Sunday, even if you're not religious. It will be one of your few allowed breaks.

Be extra careful about following protocol at the firing range. If the drills don't like you and you screw up by pointing your weapon in the wrong direction, they'll use it as an excuse to separate you.

Don't fall asleep on fire watch or any other kind of guard duty. But do fall asleep where it's allowed and you can get 5 minutes.

2021-06-22 23:31:40,wallstreetbets,"Few ways to play this:

1 -Suggest meeting at your place first for a drink while you wait to share an Uber for the date. Tell her that way neither of you have to drink and drive. If she is good with the Uber, then you know she plans on drinking with you. If she says she'll drive, then you know she wants to play it more reserved. In that case, meet her out and don't plan on her coming back. 

2 - if she's good sharing an Uber, have her come up for a drink while you call the car and wait. That gets her used to seeing your place. Showing her there are no surprises and thereby making her more comfortable.

3 - If the night goes well, she is already coming back with you via Uber to her car anyways. Wait till you are out of the Uber and follow her lead. If she beads for the car, wish her goodnight. If she lingers, then ask her up for another drink.

This all allows her to call the shots without you ever asking anything."

Lumber stocks have sold off in anticipation of lumber prices returning pre-COVID levels, but if said prices never return these stocks are absurdly cheap. Futures have been level in the $800-900 range over the last week. Mills are basically printing money at any price over $600.

UFS is OK, but my personal favourite is Resolute. Currently trading in the low 13s and offering a $1 special dividend at close on June 24. Forward P/E is anything from 1.5 to 3 depending on what prices do in the next few months.

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH Technical Analysis Hello guys, today I will take a look on wish from technical view.

I used to analyze a set of indicators and see wich of them are working well for the stock. Not allways the MACD (for example) will be a good indicator. ***Each stock has own personality***.

Besides that (another trick/custom) I used to make the simplest chart I can... When you have a lot of indicators, you cant conclude nothing

After a while of seeing wich are the best indicators for $WISH, I concluded the EMA 20 in hourly bars it's looking great

https://preview.redd.it/5a6gvoe48v671.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5db7ea74f73d68e4bc37d942fb233fecf84deb98

Is it clearly that the EMA20 (1hr) was a good buy/sell indicator

So, WISH broke his EMA 20 (1hr) on 6/8/2021 with extremely high volume and was bouncing there always. 

Looking closely, we are in a little short term triangle now. If we see a downbreak, EMA20 will be the support, and if we experience an upside break, we are going to fight with the USD 15 resistance (obviously, if I see a break below the EMA20 I will sell all my shares)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eavbj52z8v671.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8577a5620367eb48717d929e73478641745e401e

Is it clear I'm very long WISH (I had 7500 shares yesterday and I bought the dip today and I have now 11500). But I think is healthy to share with you which are the critical levels IMO.

Regarding that wish was the most mentioned ticket on WSB yesterday, and was the second most traded stock IN ALL THE MARKET (traded USD 3B dollars) I think we will break USD 15 easily. Once it happen, we can take a break at USD 16,8, with a dip to USD 15 and then upside to 20. Because usually, once a stock break a resistance, will be test the same value as a support.

2021-06-22 23:47:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but if you spend the money to get to production you will probably go bankrupt, so delaying might be a better option. Lol."
2021-06-22 23:55:50,wallstreetbets,"You just gave a pile of hogwash when you talk about the ATVM loan. The only smart thing is to assume the loan is a dead end and Lordstown, like Lucid and others (who also went through the due diligence  stage) will simply not get the loan. Better to buy lottery tickets then to assume that loan is coming through.

The reason you are waiting for that ATVM loan is because the collateral (the factory) is not worth much (the CFO who refused to suggest how much of a borrowing base it would provide on the last earnings call has since run away from this company). The ATVM is a mythical lifeline you are touting in the hope of pumping the price to make funding easier.

As to how there would not be demand... Well how about:

1. Well, first, can you actually produce the vehicle at the price points promised?
2. If RIDE goes bankrupt where can someone get service parts from? Don't forget Camping World is now out of the picture.
3. In-wheel motors, even if they work, will be less efficient so cost of running will be more than for a chassis mounted EV.
   1. To make in-wheel motors work, RIDE had to add weight to the vehicles, that impacts efficiency.
   2. In-wheel motors will have greater rotational inertia which increase energy usage.
   3. In-wheel motors add unsprung weight which probably results in greater energy losses on hitting bumps.
4. The extra weight of the vehicle and the unsprung mass might combine to impact tire life, increasing service costs.
5. 4 in-wheel motors versus one robust chassis mounted one (well, are we not talking about fleets that want to save money here?) that is well insulated from the outside environment and has proper cooling, seems to be more likely to require service."

2021-06-22 22:26:19,wallstreetbets,"Sec inquiry, and a separate legal counsel investigated and determined the wording of some press misrepresented order volume.  However, not all orders were fake.  

First Energy is still one of hundreds of companies fully committed.  When Burns left, they reconfirmed which orders were still valid and in. They have enough orders to max capacity through 2022.   20,000 trucks will be sold and delivered by May 2022."

2021-06-23 00:34:02,wallstreetbets,"The last 10% is as hard if not harder than the first 90%. For a company that has never produces EV's to get to production is a lot harder than you imagine.

Henrik Fisker, who made that statement, had one company that actually produced a high-end vehicle, but the company went bankrupt.

Tesla, had tremendous difficultly in producing the Model 3 and almost went bankrupt in the process.

Workhorse, is producing vehicles at a very low rate currently and each period as their production goes up, their cash burn goes up and they are rushing towards bankruptcy.

NIO, produced last quarter 20,000 vehicles and is losing money still. The last three years since they started production, they have lost over $2.5B on operations.

But somehow we are to believe that a company with all the ridiculous issues and lies, which is putting out an unrproven piece of tech (that required them to add weight, strengthen the frame, and do extra suspension work) is going to succeed. And that is after the going concern issue.

At some point one has to wonder how delusional the people pushing this are. Either that, or you are just shilling to pump the price."

2021-06-22 20:45:03,wallstreetbets,"Awww, are your feelings hurt ?"
2021-06-23 06:18:15,wallstreetbets,"Mostly agree there yet I made money on nio, tesla and workhorse. People make money all the time off stocks that don't have revenue yet. You make it sound like you are required to hold the stock until they become profitable. Have you heard of meme stocks? Half of them have trash fundamentals yet people make a killing off them. Again lmc is a gamble."
2021-06-22 21:01:56,wallstreetbets,"Not nearly as bad as your scrambled brains hurt, right after getting your shit pushed into them, by Jim Cramer."
2021-06-23 00:16:20,wallstreetbets,"For an accounting firm to issue a going concern it is a big deal as accounting firms, in reality, try to find enough of a reason to cover themselves and avoid making such a statement. Putting that on a statement if there was a chance to avoid it (and even if not) is an almost certain method to losing a client. Partners like money and would rather find ways to avoid the going concern. Or at least that is how the real world works, not the make-believe world of PCAOB requirements that you are supposed to live up to."
2021-06-22 20:09:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you'd think a CFO who agreed to a pushed forward earnings call, when they could have waited until after a big investors week and secured funding might get fired for that kind of dumb shit."
2021-06-22 20:13:06,wallstreetbets,"No, they don‚Äôt have the resources to operate past the next 12 months without securing additional funding and they don‚Äôt know if they can actually obtain said funding. That‚Äôs not conjecture. They literally said that in their 10-k/A.

They are not financially viable past the next 12 months."
2021-06-22 20:28:06,wallstreetbets,"""They don't know"" is a stretch. ""They can't guarantee with 100% certainty"" is a better, more accurate statement."
2021-06-22 20:47:41,wallstreetbets,I know you think there‚Äôs a lot of daylight between what I said and what you said but the company is still not financially viable.
2021-06-22 21:33:02,wallstreetbets,Having a factory that can make trucks that they can sell makes it financially viable.
2021-06-22 21:43:07,wallstreetbets,"The company does not have the resources needed to scale production. The company‚Äôs existing operation can not support itself without additional funding. Their current cash flow is negative. The company is not financially viable.

What don‚Äôt you understand?"
2021-06-23 06:21:22,wallstreetbets,"According to you then Tesla took 10 years to be ""financially viable"". Last I checked Musk was one of the richest in the world.  Your whole argument rests on negative free cash flow and ignores future sale and path to profitability"
2021-06-23 00:18:36,wallstreetbets,It is hopeless. These people are desperate for their calls to pay off.
2021-06-23 06:39:46,wallstreetbets,"No it doesn‚Äôt ignore anything. That‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt understand. The going concern analysis is based off projections and those projections indicate that they will run out of money. It already factors in potential sales!!! 

Right now, with the resources they have, they project that they can build and sell some cars but that it is not enough to scale production to the point where the company can self sustain. That‚Äôs the whole problem and that‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt get.

I used to do financial statement audits for a living. I know do financial reporting myself. Going concern is a big fucking deal. We didn‚Äôt just hand them out going concern opinions like they were candy. The auditors and the company would have spent hours pouring over financial projections before doing this. Those projections would have included any potential sales. The cash runs out before production can SCALE!

Edit: And in regards to Tesla, how many times have they received a going concern opinion from their auditors?"
2021-06-23 07:07:21,wallstreetbets,"So then you agree that with some capital injection they will have a solid path to profitability. They will suddenly become financially viable then, according to you... I'll be happy to come and chat with you once they've secured funding to see that you're now bullish on them."
2021-06-23 07:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes that‚Äôs exactly what the fuck I am saying. They are not financially viable without additional funding. Based on the eligibility requirements, an ATVM loan is not an option. You‚Äôre entire investment hinges on the company‚Äôs ability to secure additional financing. It could happen, but the clock is ticking. And don‚Äôt be surprised if any funding deal is unfavorable to the company or it‚Äôs current shareholders."
2021-06-23 08:24:07,wallstreetbets,"Why do you say ""an ATVM loan is not an option"" they are in the final stages of talks (due diligence) phase of the application, and they were hopeful (optimistic) during the conference call that they would be successful (albeit not guaranteed). Why wouldn't they be able to get a ""favorable loan"" like an asset backed loan for the assembly plant.. it's at LEAST worth $40 million because that's what LMC paid for it (and this is before they put a whole bunch of money into it) It's obviously worth more than that (some say it's worth up to $1 Billion... but that's an exaggeration imo). Interest rates are at an all time low.... getting a favorable loan to build green electric vehicles, create jobs, boost the economy... is without a doubt the most likely scenario."
2021-06-23 09:25:32,wallstreetbets,"Because they need to demonstrate financial viability to be eligible for the ATVM loan. And they can‚Äôt use ATVM loan to do so. They need to first secure funding from somewhere else and THEN they could prove financial viability for the ATVM loan.

There are numerous ways for them to secure funding. I don‚Äôt doubt that. What I doubt is whether they can get it done before time runs out. You look at this situation and view it as a no-brainer for someone to lend to them. If it was a no-brainer, they wouldn‚Äôt have gotten to this point to begin with. They would have secured lending before it ever even got this bad.

For all of Tesla‚Äôs problems in its early years, they never once reached going concern opinion status. Your confidence in Lordstown‚Äôs ability to secure funding stems from your investment in them. 

If this company manages to secure funding AND the ATVM loan, then I will take a deeper look. But right now, this company isn‚Äôt an investment. It‚Äôs a high risk gamble. Real money is at stake. That‚Äôs why DD posts like this one absolutely piss me the fuck off. They blur the that distinction.

Best of luck to you. I sincerely hope this works out in your favor. And if it doesn‚Äôt, I hope you are smart enough to realize you are wrong before it‚Äôs too late. Don‚Äôt let the hope of a big payoff or FOMO cloud your judgment and minimize the value of what you currently have. Smart money would, at a minimum, reduce their stake until conditions improve."
2021-06-23 11:04:44,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate your feedback, I agree there is a risk.. but if you take a step back and realize that this is the future, this is where the current administration will invest.. and the company has completed the largest hurdles (safety testing, validation, etc.). If LMC fails now, by running out of money.... inches before it gets to that ""financial viability"" finish line, I would be VERY surprised."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I refuse to $BLNK Open your eyes like you just saw the 2 for 4 at Wendys for the first time, and grab a rolling pin because we are gonna try to make some wrinkles on those smooth brains for a second. Using those tasty senses we've been developing, we're gonna look at $BLNK.

**TD;DR**

* Passes the SMELL test
* Undervalued
* 34% short interest
* Way off its highs
* Stock pile of cash
* Stocks only go up
* Blink and you will miss it

# What is BLNK

I've come across it a few times but its always just been one of those stocks that you see and mean to buy, but got distracted because you‚Äôre out of crayons to eat and forget about it. But now that it is off its highs and all EV related stocks seem down, its perfect timing. They don't just charge your Tesla, they charge all their competitors too. Blink Charging co. owns and operates/provides electric vehicle charging equipment and EV charging services all over the US. They just Contracted to Deploy Charging stations all across New Jersey. Now that all states are required to switch a large percentage of their old boomer fuel to EV, states are rushing to make charging more accessible for their citizens, and being able to charge all electric vehicles including teslas are huge (teslas use a different charger than other electric vehicles). Their recent earnings are dismaying because they have not had any big contracts recently, but they still make profit. Now that the contracts like New Jersey are starting to come in, more will follow, which would explain over a quarter Billion in $tendies stockpile they are sitting on. Im assuming they are getting ready to amp up production with it, or roll out something big üöÄüöÄüöÄ

# SMELL Test

Ive been seeing a lot of people using the SMELL test on here so I decided to give it a try and came up with $BLNK

**Short Interest**: SI of float is currently estimated at 34.51% by marketbeat. We aren't looking for a short squeeze, but simply extra source of buying pressure. If stock prices rise, shorts will want to close their positions soon since this stock already has an eye bulging amount of upside.

**Market cap**: 1.714 Billion according to yahoo finance

**Extremely memeable**: Don't BNLK or you'll miss it.

**Low Liquidity**: Average volume is only 3m shares according to yahoo. Institution ownership is 27.83% and most of that is brand new in 2021 with Goldman Sachs, Citi, Blackrock, JPMorgan, Schwab, all adding 40%+ to their positions just last month alone.

**Low Risk**: IV is 80% which is actually pretty low for this stock, whos high this year was 271%, even its average is 118%, so I think its taking off üöÄüöÄüöÄ üåï  to the moon soon and the IV with it.

# Expectations

Previously the stock exploded at the end of 2020, and only stopped when everything else EV did to breathe a bit. Now that things are heating back up, if we look at where it sat around 30 and then doubles, Im thinking it will skyrocket past its high of 60 to double again at 80 once it gets going and their new contracts roll through.

I am not a financial adviser, this is just my opinion, you are responsible for your own risk

This is my second DD, and my goal (as always) is to provide you with ALL the info I have so you can make your own EDUCATED decisions. THAT MEANS do not just take my word for any of this. I suggest you all ‚ÄúTrust but verify‚Äù.

Similar to my first DD (Energy Transfer, ET ‚Äì which has done quite well btw), I‚Äôm not going to mention short interest because you should invest in shit for better reasons (my personal opinion).

But briefly...there isn't much short interest. Which indicates to me that the market as a whole is bullish on this pick.

# ------Ternium ($TX)------

**Background**

As any quality DD begins, lets start by explaining basically who Ternium is. Ternium ($TX) is Latin America‚Äôs leading flat steel producer with an annual crude steel production capacity of 12.4 million tons.

TX operates in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, the southern United States and Central America through regional manufacturing facilities, service centers and its own distribution network. In addition, TX participates in the control group of Usiminas, a leading flat steel company in the Brazilian market.

Their customers range from small businesses to large global companies in the automotive, home appliances, heat, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), construction, capital goods, container, food and energy industries across the Americas. TX‚Äôs industrial system has various production technologies that provide a diversified cost structure, based on different types of raw material and energy sources, and a flexible production configuration. The industrial system includes proprietary iron ore mines and processing facilities, steelmaking facilities, finishing facilities, service centers and a broad distribution network to offer slabs, billets, hot-rolled products, cold-rolled products, galvanized and electro-galvanized sheets, pre-painted sheets, tinplate, welded pipes, rebars and wire rods as well as slit and cut-to-length products.

A large number of co-products result from the steel manufacturing process. These can be reutilized, thus helping to reduce CO2 emissions. In the latest years, TX has achieved a 100% material efficiency and the number of co-products resulting from the manufacturing processes has increased significantly.

Their steel then created utilizing both Electric Arc Furnaces and BOF Converters. Blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace uses iron ore as its base raw material that accounts over just 50% of BOF steel costs, and electric arc furnace uses scrap as its base that represents around 75% of EAF steel cost. The Basic Oxygen Steelmaking process differs from the EAF is that BOF is self-sufficient in energy.

TX‚Äôs EBITDA per ton in the first quarter of 2021 was $341.1, increasing $130.8 sequentially and $240.4 on a year-over-year basis. Ternium's realized steel prices increased significantly in the period under a strong global pricing environment, particularly in the North American steel market. On the other hand, the company's cost per ton also increased, mainly reflecting higher costs of raw materials, purchased slabs and energy.

**Outlook**

Ternium expects a sequentially higher EBITDA in the second quarter primarily due to an increase in realized steel prices, partially offset by higher cost per ton due to higher iron ore, scrap and slab costs flowing through the company‚Äôs inventories.

Following the pandemic-induced decrease in steel consumption during the first half of 2020, an increased demand for steel has outpaced the speed of the recovery in global steel production. This has driven a significant increase in steel benchmark prices around the globe over the last nine months. Iron ore benchmark prices are also reaching multi-year highs. The company currently expects these conditions will tend to normalize during the second half of 2021.

Ternium expects the commissioning of its new hot rolling mill in Mexico during June 2021, with ramp-up during the second half of 2021, will contribute to increase its market offering in this scenario, with an expanded product range and improved productivity levels in its industrial system.

Ternium anticipates sequentially higher realized steel prices in Mexico in the second quarter of 2021, as prices in the USMCA market continue to increase and quarterly contract prices reset.

Ternium also expects volumes in Mexico to increase in the second quarter, with strong demand from exports-driven industrial customers and steady activity in the commercial market.

**Catalyst ‚Äì Biden Infrastructure Plan**

At least 21 senators from both parties have backed a framework that seeks to spend roughly $1 trillion on transportation, broadband and water systems. This requires a fuck-load of steel.

The talks are still ongoing though, so we‚Äôll see if something gets done. However, it sounds like things are promising?

‚ÄúPresident Joe Biden‚Äôs administration on Tuesday (6/22/2021) continued to sound somewhat upbeat on achieving a bipartisan deal on infrastructure spending, as some of its top officials met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.‚Äù

\---------------

**Why I think the stock good:**

Very simple, the company has like no debt. They produce something that everyone needs. That thing is steel. Steel costs a lot of money, and will continue to into the foreseeable future.

The CME group bumped hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel futures to over $1000 out till Dec 2022 (previously July 2022).

2021-06-22 22:16:39,wallstreetbets,"One striking thing is the projected earnings in Simply Wall Street and Yahoo: they are largely underestimated considering the prices and TX history in the June presentation. Yet, SWS thinks the company is very undervalued.

The analyst forecasts in yahoo basically put the EPS barely above that of Q1. While the price of steel has been massively increasing (1450-ish on average in Q2, against 1100-ish in Q1); how is that possible? Their EBITDA per ton has been price per ton -700 the last quarters. Even if costs increase, I struggle to see how their EPS could only increase by 4% when prices are USD 350 higher.

Do you remember in March when we took this to $45 ? ? ? ? ?

Its following what appears to be the exact same set up as last time. Small spiratic gains, then shorted heavily. Then its rinse and repeat until the shorts start losing ground. The last time the bears were this out of ammo was the last GME and AMC skyrocketed end if February.

I'm getting deja vu.

This stock has hit its tipping point today in my opinion by breaking through the 19 dollar wall. It appears that the shorts covered then reapplied at 19 which we just broke through again. This was exactly what was happening from what I can tell last time she gamma squeezed.

Now with multiple stocks skyrocketing all in the same week, the hedge funds holding this down are extremely weak. RKT has been gaining volume the last week. RKT is a powder keg about to go off! The one major difference between this stock and the ""MEMES"" Is that ROCKET makes money, a shit ton of money.

Now I understand that we dont have the dividend news we had last time. I get that. But I think with the continuing pressure we still see another massive spike in RKTS future!

Summary of article:

There are 4 types of alternative commercial transportation energy options:

Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel

Natural Gas

Battery Electric

Hydrogen Fuel Cell

CNG and RNG provided cost savings of around $1 per gallon over diesel before the crude oil market plummeted at the end of 2014. This was when the price of oil was above $100 a barrel.  With fuel spikes this will come back where cng is more economically feasible.  CNG is positioned to be one of the most practical alternative fuels if all other factors align.

Battery Electric requires a lot of infrastructure and stations to recharge.  Limitations on the range of battery charge further exacerbate this challenge. Batteries are extremely heavy. Trucks have weight-restricted carrying capacity, so it is unappealing to forego a full truck for an electrified powertrain.¬† Additionally, battery technology is limited by time and range. Once it is fully charged ranges sit around 200 miles. Most long-haul shipments are 1,000 miles or more.¬†

Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles face an even steeper uphill battle than electric in terms of infrastructure. While hydrogen trucks will need fewer recharges due to their extended range, they still need specific hydrogen fueling stations. In 2019, there were only 40 public hydrogen fueling stations in the U.S.

It doesn‚Äôt matter that analysts love this stock or blah blah. There‚Äôs only one reason I‚Äôm playing this: 26% earnings before fees and 62% of revenue comes from repeat customers. Those numbers are insane. It has been also noted by analysts that almost all customers are 18-32, meaning they will continue to be loyal customers for years to come. Not to mention the vast influx of Nursing and Medical school applications because of COVID. 

There will always be healthcare workers and I can promise you that they are tired of wearing the same type of scrubs since 1972. There will be a huge shift in consumer trends in this market in the coming months and $FIGS will be leading the change. The healthcare clothing industry is worth $50B annually, $FIGS currently only control less than half a billion of it; for DD purposes I bought their scrubs and a set from their competitor to try on and there‚Äôs is lightyears ahead of the competition. 

Now here‚Äôs where it get‚Äôs interesting. This has only 17% institutional ownership. At the moment of me writing this $FIGS is only owned by 5 institutions with Viking Global and the Pennsylvania Public School Pension Plan (which is rumored to have already sold their position at the bottom lmfao) holding 98% of institutional shares. So what do you think happens when HF‚Äôs and institutions finally discover this stock? It will sky rocket. These analyst price targets of $40-50 a share are dead wrong. $FIGS to $200 a share by EOY.

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AMC Covered Options Trading  Hello, my dear option-trade-loving apes.

In light of the recent roller coaster events at $AMC, I think I have found a less retarded (most of you probably lose interest at this point) way of losing your bananas.

Covered options writing.

Option premiums at $AMC are still exaggerated as fuck and I think, provide an interesting opportunity to use some of your ~~gambling~~ investing money. With covered options writing, you get to collect the premium and limit your risk by owning the underlying asset ($AMC stock).

In my humble opinion there are multiple catalysts upcoming for the stock to drop (e.g. upcoming equity raise, reopening of the cinemas being less enthusiastic than the current expectations, etc.). Hence, I am choosing the short version of the trade. However, if you‚Äôre a real quality ape and are still shouting diamond hands in your sleep, a long version of the trade (write calls/buy stock) includes the same trade mechanics (just vice-versa). You can figure it out, trust me.

The trade itself is simple enough. You would write covered puts (short stock and sell OTM puts) expiring, for example, July 9th and short AMC stock at the current price of $55.69. Let's say you sell 100 shares of AMC and write 1 July 9th put option with a strike price of $40 for $4.1 (premium received).

From this point onwards there are 3 major scenarios:

* **If shares trade at $59.79 (share price + option premium), this is your break-even point.**
* **If $AMC trades below $59.79, your profit increases accordingly, up to the maximum profit level of $1979 at or below $40/share.**
* **If shares trade above $59.79, the option expires worthless, while your short position starts losing money. In this case, the downside is virtually unlimited, just as you like it.**

To make it really simple, what you need for this trade to work is $AMC share price to trade between the strike price of the option and the price at which you‚Äôve shorted (+ option premium). The closer it is to the strike price (in this case $40/share), the higher your upside and vice versa.

**Some more calculations at different potential price levels:** 

Price at $10:

* Short position: ($55.69-$10) \* 100 = $4569
* Put option: ($4.1-$30) \* 100 = -$2590
* Total profit: -$2590 + $4569 = $1979

Price at $35:

* Short position: ($55.69-$35) \* 100 = $2069
* Put option: ($4.1-$5) \* 100 = -$90
* Total profit: -$90 + $2069 = $1979

Price at $45:

* Short position: ($55.69-$45) \* 100 = $1069
* Put option: worthless, you keep your $4.1 premium received \* 100 = $410
* Total profit: $1069 + $410 = $1479

Price at $55:

* Short position: ($55.69-$55) \* 100 = $69
* Put option: worthless, you keep your $4.1 premium received \* 100 = $410
* Total profit: $69 + $410 = $479

Price at $59.79:

* Short position: ($55.69-$59.79) \* 100 = -$410
* Put option: worthless, you keep your $4.1 premium received \* 100 = $410
* Total profit: 0

Price at $70:

* Short position: ($55.69-$70) \* 100 = -$1431
* Put option: worthless, you keep your $4.1 premium received \* 100 = $410
* Total profit: -$1431 + $410 = -$1021

Price: $100

* Short position: ($55.69-$100) \* 100 = -$4431 
* Put option: worthless, you keep your $4.1 premium received \* 100 = $410

A brief overview: Housing demand is at 2005 levels, during a major housing shortage that will take a decade to sort out. Commodity prices don't matter -- buyers are paying. Evidence? Data says so, CEOs say so, and LEN just blew out earnings and went up 10%. **KBH earnings are coming up Wednesday and it tends to roll with LEN, so I'm rolling the dice with KBH on July/Aug calls, plus commons because gay pride.**

Annoyingly long TLDR below, then I get gay.

\-----------

The residential construction market is hot, despite high prices:

* Demand is insane. **We are essentially in 2005**: High housing market index. High housing starts. High orders.
* High commodity costs are a non-issue -- **prices get passed on to buyers.**
* KBH caters to the exact demographic with the highest demand: first-time buyers, west + central.
* Residential construction stocks are down from Mid-may due to The Great Inflation Scare, and haven't recovered yet.
* Real estate is generally thought of as an ""inflation proof"" investment.
* Whether or not there is inflation, people are going to buy houses at record pace for the foreseeable future.

All signs point to a great KBH earnings report (Wednesday after close):

* All of the above.
* LEN has the same earnings calendar. They reported last Wed (Jun 16). Result? Blowout. Popped up 10% in two sessions.
* LEN had no problem building homes, taking orders, and increasing margins despite high costs.
* KBH tracks LEN share price rather consistently -- and KBH hasn't moved yet. I see 10% upside, easy.
* I scraped a housing review site. Results are inconclusive, but if you squint they look bullish.
* Commodities may be entering a bear market, which may cause higher guidance (lower commodity prices == higher margin).

I Like The Stock:

* Massive cashflow, massive backlog of orders, massive orders getting added.
* In the right place at the right time: West and central regions.
* CEO made the news when he called neighbor Kathy Griffin a ""bald dyke"" and ""cunt"" after she made a noise complaint on his 3 grandchildren swimming in his pool. Bullish.

July/Aug calls:

* A bet on positive earnings Wednesday, following in LEN's footsteps.
* A bet on a \~10% catch-up to LEN, as they generally track one-another and LEN is up.
* Housing market is clearly bullish and I see no reason it will slow down.
* Many builders report in July, so Aug calls could bang.
* Risk/reward seems solid.

# I. Housing Supply Shortage, and Historic Demand Levels

The current housing situation, for builders, is better than any erection drawing they've ever seen:

* The supply of homes was already at a shortage -- about 5.5 million houses too few.
* People were already moving out of cities and into suburbs.
* Then COVID caused the move-to-suburbs trend to massively accelerate, leading to a surge in home demand.
* COVID dampened the ability to construct homes, causing even more supply deficit.
* **So we now have massive demand, and short supply.**
* The people moving tend to have a lot of money, and they're buying despite high costs.
* We are now at \~2005 levels: housing starts, orders, sentiment; all skyrocketing.
* It may take a full decade to build enough houses to satisfy the current demand.

## SUPPLY: The Great Housing Shortage

COVID caused construction to slow. Everybody had to quarantine and wear masks and shit. Unprecedented times. It was a really hard period that has changed us all forever and bla bla bla.

All that matters for us is: **home construction slowed, during a period where people increasingly wanted to move into houses, and after a period where there weren't enough houses already.**

On June 18th, The National Association of Realtors released a report titled ""Underbuilding Left America Short 5.5M to 6.8M Homes"", [it's here (but behind a paywall)](https://www.bankerandtradesman.com/nar-underbuilding-left-america-short-5-5m-to-6-8m-homes/). You may choose not to believe NAR, which could be described as a lobbying group, in which case you can [read this discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/realestateinvesting/comments/o1458f/why_does_the_media_treat_the_national_association/).

That NAR report is behind a paywall, but [the WSJ wrote a piece about it here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-housing-market-needs-5-5-million-more-units-says-new-report-11623835800), which I'll quote just to give you an idea of how severe the supply shortage is:

**Shortage existed Pre-COVID:**

>The report also says that from 2010 to 2020, new-home construction fell 6.8 million units short of what was needed to meet household-formation growth and replace units that were aging or destroyed by natural disasters.

**Housing prices are up, but demand is still bottlenecked by supply:**

>Limited supply has been a recent driver of rising housing prices for renters and home buyers, alongside robust demand.  
>  
>The supply shortage became especially acute in the past year. Builders slowed construction in some regions last spring and delayed land purchases because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, low mortgage-interest rates and an increase in remote work led to a surge in demand for single-family housing. And many homeowners delayed or canceled plans to list their homes for sale.  
>  
>Builders ramped up the pace in 2020 in response to robust demand. **Housing starts, a measure of home-building activity, rose last year to 1.38 million units, the highest rate since 2006. But shortages of labor, ready-to-build land and materials have limited the pace of construction growth, builders say.**

What do you reckon will happen to KBH if/when they announce better access to labor and materials? Have you noticed that lumber and copper have gone down significantly since May?

**Builders will need to build at an incredible rate:**

>To shrink the supply deficit, builders would need to exceed the long-term historical average pace of 1.5 million units a year, according to the NAR report. At 2.1 million units a year, near the level reached in 2005, it would take a decade to close a gap of 5.5 million units, the report says.

So there you have it: **not enough homes, and a surge in demand.** Builders have a lot of [back-filling](https://www.google.com/search?q=back+filling) to do, and believe me, they are happy to do it. **This construction boom is going to last.**

## DEMAND: The Great Migration

It's no secret that COVID jump-started a massive migration out of cities. Arguably, COVID just accelerated an already occuring trend of people leaving cities (most evident in SF and NYC). **What's important here is where people are moving, and who is moving. Keep in mind KBH targets first-time home buyers and is largely based in CA, WA, CO, and TX.**

## Where are people moving? (West + Central)

[This article from Bloomberg (April 26, 2021)](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-citylab-how-americans-moved/) provides some amazing infographics and far more information than I can fit into my smooth, [butt-glazed](https://www.google.com/search?q=butt+glazed) brain. But my takeaway is this:

&#x200B;

[People are moving out of cities, and into suburban counties.](https://preview.redd.it/hrm3gakywu671.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecc673a4c2d78979a91a7e4596d30d25617ca1e3)

This quote says it all:

>82% of urban centers saw more people moving out then in. 91% of suburban counties saw more people moving in than out.

Cities are seeing some serious [shrinkage](https://www.google.com/search?q=wood+shrinkage), while suburbs are [rising damp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_damp_(structural)).

[This article from CNBC (April 15, 2021)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/15/millennials-moving-out-of-big-cities-where-they-are-going-smartasset.html) highlights where millennials are moving to the most:

* Denver (CO)
* Seattle (WA)
* Phoenix (AZ)
* Austin (TX)
* Colorado City (CO)

Notice anything? **KBH operates in six states -- and all of them are on this list. KBH also caters to first-time buyers (millennials).**

## Who is moving?

[This Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-14/rich-americans-likelier-to-move-house-reversing-pre-covid-data) provides insight:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xsqnmxqzwu671.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cddf1958ef4c02c778ccc1c987074aa95f662c6

Some quotes:

>High-earning Americans are now likelier to move house than low earners in a reversal of the usual pattern, according to new research, as the pandemic offers remote-work opportunities to white-collar employees.  
>  
>The biggest jump in residential migration has come among workers earning more than $150,000, according to analysis by Apartmentlist.com based on Census Bureau surveys. About 16% of that group relocated in the past year, up from 11.5% in 2019.

They were already moving before. Now they're really moving.

Do not misconstrue this as ""the rich are the *only* people moving"" -- they're just moving at higher rates than previously. As costs go up, there is plenty of demand willing to pay.

That's great they are moving -- but does this equate to new house purchases? Keep reading.

## Sentiment (HMI): Up (esp. West + Central)

This is one of those index numbers that comes out each month, and when it does the market sometimes goes batshit crazy and pumps or dumps real estate related stocks. Values >50 are bullish, <50 are bearish. Lately it's been on the [wac track](https://www.google.com/search?q=wac+track) upwards.

>The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) is based on a monthly survey of NAHB members designed to take the pulse of the single-family housing market. The survey **asks respondents to rate market conditions for the sale of new homes at the present time and in the** ***next six months*** as well as the traffic of prospective buyers of new homes.

[Here are the latest numbers](https://www.nahb.org/-/media/NAHB/news-and-economics/docs/housing-economics/hmi/202106/t1-nahb-wellsfargo-national-and-regional-hmi-202106.xls), released Jun 15th. Historical data is found [here](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/housing-economics/indices/housing-market-index). But don't worry, I'll break it down for you retards.

**We're at all time highs.**

&#x200B;

[HMI numbers at all-time highs.](https://preview.redd.it/il6qwpv0xu671.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=794457786899453d0212feebde97ae3ccb888aab)

And how does this break out, regionally?

&#x200B;

[Recent HMI numbers by region \(KBH Q2 highlighted\)](https://preview.redd.it/qu8063b2xu671.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=6123485dad7d7c5743b2bf2cb434da681842e002)

Notice which regions have the highest numbers for Q2? I made it bluer than your balls just for you. That's right, you stud, South + West. Keep in mind, ""South"" basically means ""Texas"", which KBH would consider ""Central"". **So we have record high sentiments in West and Central during Q2. Can you remember in which regions KBH builds?**

So, yeah, **demand is at historic levels, particularly in the regions KBH caters to, despite prices being high.**

## Housing starts: Up (esp. West + Central)

Is this *real* demand, or just, people saying: ""Yeah, I want a house. The Wendy's parking lot just isn't doing it for me.""

It's real.

&#x200B;

[Housing starts in the last year. Up.](https://preview.redd.it/sedtyfe3xu671.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a17f07e5bc920baa6ecf8e63ea8c661e2706534)

This data is from census.gov. Big brother tracks building permit numbers categorized as: authorized, started, under construction, and completed. [Recent data here](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/index.html). [Historical data here](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/historical_data/index.html).

You can see the ""started"" numbers are going up and up, **despite the price of commodities rising since at least October.**

Let's zoom out, and once again take a look at *where* all this building is taking place:

&#x200B;

[Housing starts by region since 1990 alongside HPI.](https://preview.redd.it/r6puw6r9xu671.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=b12fd23f12b324e1a0762a2cf737705197a60a65)

I added the housing price index to this graph:

>The FHFA HPI serves as a timely, accurate indicator of house price trends at various geographic levels.

It doesn't adjust for inflation. In fact, some would argue it's a pretty good measurement of inflation. **Regardless, you can houses are being built at 2003 levels despite the high prices.**

And where are they being built? West and South (aka Texas, aka KBH's ""Central"")? West and Central, again.

So there you have it. Record demand, and skyrocketing building rates, without a fuck given about prices. **KBH must be salivating at the thought of all that oozing caulk.**

\-----------

# II. The Commodities Boogeyman (High prices don't matter)

Ok, so you have a picture of the crazy demand and crazy short supply of houses. Now let's address the boogeyman on everyone's mind: the spike in commodity prices.

Do not fear high commodity prices. **The spike in commodity prices is a direct result of the boom in residential construction (and surge in demand) -- prices are high because the market is willing to pay.**

**TLDR:**  Houses use a lot of lumber and copper. High lumber and copper prices are a *consequence* of the insane demand for houses, are passed on to the consumer, and do not impact margins. As commodity prices fall, builders stand to increase their margins. Bullish. As. Fuck.

## Lumber and Copper

The same shit that happened to home building happened to lumber and copper. Shut downs in production from COVID, but an increase in demand afterward -- largely driven by residential construction.

From [this source](https://www.copper.org/education/c-facts/home/), residential construction accounts for a full 1/3rd of the usage of copper.

Residential construction also accounts for some massive percentage of lumber usage. I can't be arsed to look it up, but just think of all the [rim joists](https://www.google.com/search?q=rim+joist), [batter boards](https://www.google.com/search?q=batter+board), etc, that go into a house. My point: **the surge in home building, where the demand is so high, means copper and lumber get bid up**.

**The costs get passed on to the buyers**, and the market will show you as much. Look: lumber and copper prices skyrocket, but KBH and LEN stocks barely flinch.

&#x200B;

[KBH and LEN don't care about commodity prices](https://preview.redd.it/cnalsz78xu671.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4eaa9bb6afea1196f74af2e4aa3b559c1af9593)

I will cover the price dip that occurred in May in section III.

So don't worry about high commodity costs -- the demand for them is high from housing, but the supply is taking time to catch up from COVID. **Despite commodity prices going higher, demand is still insane and houses are getting built.**

## Increasing deliveries, increasing home starts

You might still be unconvinced that high commodity prices don't matter to home purchasers. Even after I already fucking explained how high demand is, how high HMI numbers are, and that the rampant rush on building houses is what is actually causing the high commodity prices in the first place.

If you don't believe me, take that [sex bolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_bolt) out of your [stud pocket](https://www.google.com/search?q=stud+pocket) and look at the charts below.

&#x200B;

[Orders, deliveries, and house starts. Up and up.](https://preview.redd.it/ht704fcdxu671.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=e323ae8d31d3f06440c61e33f6ac0947c515fdaa)

(Note: Q1 for these companies is: Dec, Jan, and Feb)

Look at the light blue bars. Does it look like inflation and commodity prices are of any concern to the people ordering homes?

\-----------

# III. The Great Inflation Scare of May

Let me recap what happened in mid May: People emptied their [weep holes](https://www.google.com/search?q=weephole) due to inflation. Their [butt-welds](https://www.google.com/search?q=buttweld) simply burst from fears the world was ending.

LEN got [bush hammered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_hammer) from $51 down to $44, and now hovers at $43 as there's some rotation back to tech and the market circles in a landing pattern with no conviction of where to land.

**Yet.. conditions for builders have only improved since May**:

* KBH has stated costs could be passed on to buyers.
* LEN has proven costs could be passed on to buyers in Q2, and actually increased their margins in Q2.
* **Copper and Lumber costs have tumbled since May, which will further increase margin.**

Inflation or not, KBH is printing money hand over fist, will reveal this in Q2 earnings, and will continue to crush Q3 and Q4 aided by lower prices of commodities and continued strong demand and shortage in supply.

## Buyers will pay, CEOs say.

You don't have to trust fancy graphs and those squiggly whatsits... numbers. You can see what LEN and KBH execs have openly said about the effects of rising commodity prices. Well, *you* personally probably won't, but I did.

## KBH Q1 transcript (March 24)

>So no, I'm not overly concerned at this point. In fact, we've been confident enough and thought about the year favorably enough to lift the margin guidance as we go. So **we're actually even feeling a little bit better about our profitability than we were three months ago.**

Higher lumber costs... and yet higher profitability? How's that possible? Oh, right. People want to live in homes rather than in the Wendy's parking lot, and will pay for it.

## KBH CEO (May 6)

Taken from [here](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/05/business/lumber-prices-home-building-costs/index.html).

>**While lumber prices have gone up, we have been able to pass it on to the consumer with higher prices for homes.** \- KBH CEO Jerffrey Mezger

That pretty much says it all.

## LEN Q2 earnings transcript (Jun 17)

No need for conjecture -- let's see how this quarter *actually* panned out for LEN so far, which just reported earnings last week.

>Q4 of 2020 is when we saw the first significant increase in lumber costs, which impacted primarily our Q2 deliveries. The lumber increases, which occurred in Q1 and Q2, will mostly flow through our deliveries in the second half of the year. But as we noted and Diane will cover more detail, we believe that Lennar's pricing power will more than offset this and we expect to deliver stronger gross margins.

The true test will be Q3 and Q4, where the high prices of lumber will have had the largest impact.  But as for now, yeah, **their margins actually increased**. I think we will hear the same story with KBH on Wednesday.

Also from this transcript:

>Looking forward, we expect to see some limited relief on our lumber costs for our July starts as more expensive lumber works its way through the system. And if the current downward trend holds, we'll see a more significant benefit for August starts.

You catch that? Margins managed to increase during high lumber prices in Q2. So what will happen in Q3 and Q4 if lumber continues to decrease? (It peaked in May). Yeah. More margin, creating an [ultimate load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_load) of profit.

## Expect a recovery from Q2 and beyond

**The stock price has yet to recover from May. I'm betting it will.**

There is no reason these stocks should be cheaper than they were in May. There is every indication they are doing *better* than they were in May:

* Inflation or not, people are buying houses
* More orders
* More housing starts
* Higher HMI sentiment
* LEN proved costs don't matter, they increased their margins
* And, now: there's LOWER cost of material

\-----------

# IV: Canary in the Tendies Kitchen - Where LEN goes, KBH follows.

Both LEN and KBH share the same weird corporate calendar where their quarters are set back a month. So, Q1 is Dec/Jan/Feb, and Q2 is Mar/Apr/May.

LEN posted earnings last week. They crushed it and surged 10% in the two trading sessions afterward. So to the extent that market conditions are working in the favor of LEN, they are most likely working in favor of KBH as well.

Also from the LEN Q2 Earnings Call (Jun 17):

>The strongest market in the United States today is Austin. Notwithstanding outmigration from parts of California, the markets in California are strong. Driven by the state's severe housing shortage, there is more demand and supply, making housing the No. 1 agenda item for the governor.

Ok guys.. same quiz: Where does KBH do most of their business? Say it with me class: West and Central.

What else did LEN Q2 earnings reveal?

* LEN says demand is still strong.
* LEN says lumber costs not an issue -- they get passed on to the buyers.
* LEN delivered more houses than last quarter.
* LEN took more orders than last quarter.
* LEN increased margin their margin.

Basically, they are building as fast as possible and still continuing to grow their backlog. Looking good for KBH.

**Now, take a look at this chart showing the relationship between LEN and KBH.**

&#x200B;

[LEN up, will KBH follow?](https://preview.redd.it/cbltxfmgxu671.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=559a0ff34f6386101ce95f2850c92f8f6aa21c43)

Do you see what I see? **Where LEN leads, KBH follows. And LEN just gapped up.**

This isn't a sure-fire bet -- LEN could simply retrace downwards or the LEN/KBH spread can persist for awhile, or just fail to be a thing in the future. However, I'm a gambling man, and I'm betting on this.

## Housing Starts and Deliveries

Let's compare LEN's houses ordered and delivered (vs census.gov housing starts) to KBH.

&#x200B;

[They're both kicking ass.](https://preview.redd.it/runaqdfixu671.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cb342969f75cc842f6256404019754a85888cfb)

The key stat here is as housing starts increase, so do homes delivered. And housing starts have indeed increased. **Housing starts hit 4,814 in KBH-calendar Q2, which is a 3-month total not seen since... October 2006.**

Now maybe you want to think of yourself as some sort of clever Steve Carrell character, and that we're in a housing bubble. Or maybe you think you're that retarded glass-eye drummer dude. You do you, and sit there and whine about how the market is going to crash. I'll be that rich asshole asian guy at the restaurant whose net worth exceeds yours... because I'm betting big on KBH.

For real though, there aren't really any signs there is a bubble. This is purely demand outstripping supply.

If that many housing starts were issued, then builders were at it full force. I see no reason why KBH would be excluded from the frenzy. I think their deliveries will be up, and their orders up, further increasing their insane backlog. I also think their margins will increase, just like LEN's. They have pricing power.

**I'll take the bet that KBH blows out earnings just like LEN.**

\-----------

# V: Scraping a Reviews Website

On the topic of trying to predict deliveries -- I found [a website that allows homebuyers to write reviews](https://www.newhomesource.com/builder/kb-home/reviews/5). Perhaps there's a correlation between how many reviews are written, and how many houses KBH ends up delivering?

**So I set up a scraper and pulled all the reviews.** The dates, locations, scores, everything, for three major builders: LEN, PHM, and KBH.

## Average review scores by quarter

KBH is absolutely killing it:

|Quarter|KBH - Avg Score|LEN - Avg Score|PHM - Avg Score|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2021Q2|4.61|4.19|4.00|
|2021Q1|4.61|3.84|4.18|
|2020Q4|4.59|4.00|4.15|
|2020Q3|4.51|3.71|3.85|
|2020Q2|4.50|3.68|3.98|
|2020Q1|4.56|3.45|3.84|

## Correlation between review count and homes delivered?

Next, I tallied the number of reviews per quarter. Yes, I was careful to match the review date to the proper quarter, given LEN and KBH's weird quarterly schedule (eg: Q1 = Dec, Jan, Feb). I also took each review day and subtracted 7 days from it, to better estimate the day the house was actually delivered, since there is likely a delay between completion and writing a review.

I plotted this against the actual number of homes delivered, as reported on quarterly earnings. The theory here: **Perhaps there's a correlation between the number of reviews written, and how many houses get delivered?** That would allow us to predict this quarter's numbers.

&#x200B;

[If you squint, maybe there's a correlation](https://preview.redd.it/y0ex0lzjxu671.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=2be1d6126ed161679e35c37d99aa17dbf60d6e20)

It doesn't look like there is any strong correlation.

However, if you omit Q1 data, it looks pretty good:

* Anytime review count decreases, homes built decreases.
* Anytime review count increases, homes built increases.
* Review count, if anything, *underestimates* the amount of homes built.

**There's a spike in Q2 reviews, so I'd like to believe that will put the number of homes built at or above 3,500. But, honestly, I wouldn't bet on it just from this data.**

\-----------

# VI: The Company

If you read the entire post up to here, you're a fucking dumbass. You could have just read the TLDRs. Needless to say, it's pretty obvious that residential construction is going insane right now. I'd be happy to own pretty much any residential construction stocks over the junk you guys have been shilling lately. Green beans? Wrestling? Seriously? Who the fuck are you people.

This is a short term play -- I'll be in and out by August, maybe September -- but whatever... let's go over some basic shit about this company. I'll use this section to be a wise ass since I've been holding back for most of this DD and I've written you all a novel at this point.

**Seriously, though, you should read** [**their Q1 investor presentation**](https://s27.q4cdn.com/984711554/files/doc_presentations/2021/FINAL-Q1-2021-KBH-IR-Presentation-revised-4-13-2021.pdf)**. It is very compelling.** Yeah, I know, I'm lazy. Cut me some slack.

Here are some highlights:

## The right place at the right time

KBH is home residential construction company that builds using the ""build-to-order"" model. The come up with house models, then let you select how balls deep you want to go with the upgrades. I won't go into the details of BTO (it's in the presentation), but suffice it to say they are really good at efficiently nailing your mom's drywalls.

&#x200B;

[From the presentation deck. Go read it.](https://preview.redd.it/99op5a1mxu671.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fde082909e67eee6c8b285eb235af665ecba755)

A key aspect of this company is where they do business. Yes, again, WEST AND CENTRAL. **66% of their deliveries and 72% of their revenues are from CA, WA, TX, and CO.** They're right in the middle of where the highest demand is, and as such, I believe this gives them an advantage in capturing higher average costs and margins than their competitors.

Another advantage is their early earnings schedule, which is a full month before basically the rest of the industry (except LEN). I believe the market is slow to adjust prices on the whole industry until they see the bigger guys (DHI, PHM, NVR, TOL) report first. Luckily, LEN reported before KHR and the results were exceptional. That's enough for me.

Residential construction is currently going through a *generational* boom right now, and though a rising tide lifts all ships... I'm putting my chips on KBH for now.

## Billions in the backlog

Look at this beautiful backlog grow, and look at the quarterly orders grow.

&#x200B;

[Backlog and orders up and to the right. In the billions.](https://preview.redd.it/cydnqjnnxu671.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=ead36155d9fccd21e31dcadb7bbcd951756afd76)

## ESG Crap - EnergyStar

This plays to their soy boy customer base (millennial first time buyers). They won the ""EnergyStar 2021 Partner of the Year"". Yeah, there are actually like thirty companies that win this every year, but nonetheless the stats are kind of neat:

>Apr 13, 2001: KB Home (NYSE: KBH) today announced that it has been named an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year ‚Äì Sustained Excellence Award Winner for an unprecedented 11th consecutive year by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). KB Home has built over 150,000 ENERGY STAR certified homes, more than any other homebuilder in the nation. These high-performance, energy-saving homes are estimated to have cumulatively reduced utility bills for their homeowners by $800 million and CO2 emissions by 5.6 billion pounds, the equivalent of removing nearly 557,000 cars from the road for one year.

It's kind of suspicious that they measure CO2 emissions in pounds, because it's a gas so I have no idea how they managed to put it all on a scale. But, anyway, apparently all of the high-tech environmentally friendly crap they put in their houses cuts monthly expenses from $343 to $130 per month, meaning their houses basically pay for themselves in 195 years or so.

## ESG Crap - School Supplies

I found this touching photo in their investment deck. It's truly heartwarming that they send school supplies to poor schools -- it's probably the least they can do as they migrate high-tax-paying individuals out of cities and leave *those* schools desperately needing funding.

&#x200B;

[Look, we give money to poor students after we lure their school's tax dollars away](https://preview.redd.it/1igqxc1pxu671.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=08c4c2c936e4e4befb6308d5e07807be40de0875)

## The [King Stud](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=king%20stud) (CEO)

Here's a fun story. Back in Sep 2017 KBH CEO Jeffrey Mezger was recorded [verbally destroying Kathy Griffin and her boyfriend Randy ""No Dick"" Bick](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kathy-griffin-jeffrey-mezger-kb-home_us_59c145aee4b0186c22061a67) after they called police multiple times to report a noise complaint against him. The noise? Mezger's three grandchildren playing in the pool.

In the audio you can hear Mezger declare war, tell Mr. Bick he's stuck with a ""bald dyke cunt"" (apparently Griffin shaved her head?), and other fun shit.

Apparently Ms. Griffin and Mr. Bick had called police between 7 to 10 times in the past, and in each case the complaints were dismissed with no further action required. One of the times they called a noise complaint due to music being played during a ceremony where Mezger's niece, who has stage-4 cancer, was renewing her vows.

Due to the Griffin incident, KBH ended up cutting Mezger's salary by 25%. He never apologized, though he ""regrets losing his temper and the language he used."" He also added ""Why the fuck would you record it and submit it to Huffington Post you insignificant attention whore?""

Here's the [WSJ's coverage of the ordeal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kb-home-cuts-ceos-bonus-over-kathy-griffin-tape-1505993665).  The top comment:

>He deserves an award not a punishment

Don't fuck with Mezger.

# VII. The Bet

Welcome to my DD. You probably just skipped down to here, so let me summarize things for you.

## TLDR (again)

Housing demand is at 2005 levels, during a major housing shortage that will take a decade to sort out. Commodity prices don't matter -- buyers are paying, and in fact that's what's costs so high. Evidence? HMI index at all time highs. Housing starts at 2005 levels. Orders way up. And CEOs are saying costs are getting passed on without an issue.

The kicker: LEN and KBH report a full month before all the other builders. LEN reported last week, and they blew out earnings and went up 10% (and their margins *went up* despite commodity prices increasing). The market didn't give KBH a similar boost, and their earnings are coming up Wednesday -- which I can only assume will kick ass. I've also noticed that KBH tends to highly correlate with LEN and catches up to rather quickly.

The second kicker: Builders peaked in share prices in May, but got dumped down due to The Great Inflation Scare in mid-May. The thing is, homes are considered inflation proof. And literally every sign has pointed to better conditions now than in mid-May. Higher sentiment, more starts, and LEN crushed it Q2 (Mar, Apr, May). There is no end in sight to the demand. These stocks are due for a repricing.

**Like LEN, I think KBH built a lot of houses this quarter, took record numbers of orders, and increased margins despite high commodity prices -- I think the market might get all excited after their earnings Wednesday (after close).** If not then, then in mid/late July when all other builders report.

## Catalysts

* Wednesday, 10am: [June new home sales report comes out](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf). Will it continue to smash? Yes. Will the market react? I don't know.
* KBH Q2 Earnings (Wed after market close): There is every indication home building was insane this quarter. Highest 3-month building starts since 2005. All time high buyer sentiment. And LEN crushed it.
* Time elapses: LEN and KBH have been tethered together for awhile, and LEN just leaped up 10%. I think KBH will follow. (Section IV)

Throughout July and August, various residential construction companies report earnings. A continued stream of positive earnings could be what the nervous market is waiting for before diving back in, as they seem rather hesitant since mid-May:

* July 22nd: DHI Q2 earnings.
* July 22nd (est): PHM Q2 earnings.
* July 22nd (est): MTH Q2 earnings.
* July 23rd (est): NVR Q2 earnings.
* July 26th (est): MDC Q2 earnings.
* July 28th (est): BZH Q2 earnings.
* Aug 15 (est): TOL Q2 earnings.

Longer term, there could be more COVID; there are concerns about the delta variant. While another surge of corona could cause some panic in the market, it would serve to bolster demand further (if that's even possible). KBH crushed it during COVID, so I expect they'd crush COVID-2.0.

## Bets

This is not financial advice and I'm gay and retarded. I'm into all sorts of crazy shit. [Single hung](https://www.google.com/search?q=single+hung+window), yeah... [double hung](https://www.google.com/search?q=single+hung+window), better. [Tongue and groove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue_and_groove), [male couplings](https://www.google.com/search?q=male+couplings), [spider nuts](https://www.google.com/search?q=spider+nuts), I love it all. So you should really question my judgement and do your own research.

Once again, I advise caution. Do not YOLO. Check prices/IVs and wait for good entries. If you can't snatch July calls at a decent price, wait for things to calm down and go for August. Or, just celebrate pride month with some commons.

## July Calls

There are no FDs, but July calls are fine. They give some leeway for the market to understand commodity prices don't matter, inflation doesn't matter, and that people are ordering and building houses at an astounding rate and will continue to do so.

In my opinion, the IVs are reasonable in the mid 40s. If the stock hits $50, which I see as entirely possible, it's multi-bagger.

## August Calls

Suitable if you do not have faith KBH will catch up to LEN short term, or if you do not have faith the earnings will play favorably.

This allows you an extra month to capture the wave of builder earnings coming in July, which could provide the sufficient confirmation of ""they are building a lot despite commodities and inflation"" that the market needs to send these stocks up.

There's also some rotation of growth-to-value potential here.

## Shares

The backlog is massive and growing faster and faster. COVID-2.0 or not, inflation or not, people are buying homes and KBH stands to run alongside this current housing bull run. I think shares are a pretty safe play at least until $50.

## My positions

* Jul 16 calls $44-48
* Aug 20 Calls $50
* Lots of commons (gay pride month)"

2021-06-22 23:07:31,wallstreetbets,"So what I'm worried about and sorry if you addressed this and I missed it. The bubble in housing was not really in the building of homes, it was in the financing being made available for homes. People did want the houses, they just couldn't afford them, and for the various reasons we all know well now, the banks and mortgage brokers didn't care and lent anyway.

I would be concerned that companies like KBH are building up houses for people who are taking out excessive amounts of debt to buy something way overpriced, and in an era of an unexpected jump in inflation, will not be able or willing to pay. And then when the biggest asset they own has lost value, they are going to be cash strapped later on. Maybe KBH doesn't care as long as they get paid. But then, the question, is KBH sure they are getting paid? I guess what I wanna know is, how do you know people will keep getting financing as prices keep going up? 

I will concede that the demand might stay around for a while as at least partial remote work becomes permanent at far more places than before. I will also concede that what I said doesn't matter for a short term play. But I don't really do short term plays."

They just build and sell them then offer insurance products or title services. Basically after somebody buys a home KBH has washed their hands of all liability. Demand is still outpacing supply, and it is going to continue for at least another year as millennials who got fk‚Äôd in the last financial crisis are more determined than ever to buy a home."

I see posts there saying that the stock will go up 10% tomorrow because of us.  We'll see about that.  The other thing is that the stock is a bit volatile, but the current price looks like a good entry point.  I like your correlation between LEN and KBH.  I know that KB is building huge numbers of homes and I can see it because my brother bought one in 2016 and when I was visiting him a few weeks ago I noticed that they started building a massive number of new homes recently in his area.  I'll take a chance and buy some stock before earnings.  Thank you for your effort, OP."

2021-06-23 02:44:44,wallstreetbets,"> For real though, there aren't really any signs there is a bubble.

Yo, Jamie Dimon himself said that there is a bubble in housing prices.

Ask yourself, there has been a global real estate boom. Every single country on the planet is seeing massive real estate price increases. Then, ask yourself what links every country together in 2020? If you said central banks printing currency like it is going out of style, you would be correct. 

The supply/demand curve explanation here is the same facile one that every real estate agent all over the country is hyping. The fact is that the median household income cannot afford the median home price, so what we are seeing are people: a) getting over-extended to buy their own house at ridiculously low interest rates, or b) getting over-leveraged to buy investment properties.

Ultimately, I don't think MBS will go bust this time around because the Fed itself owns like $2T of it (about 20% of the market) directly. However, if the corporate debt bubble pops and everyone who thought their cushy desk job was so safe when waiters lost their livelihoods will find out very quickly who is expendable if C-suite bonuses are on the chopping block due to bunk earnings. 

Essentially, this is a cheap debt fueled bonanza which has completely gone beyond idiotic. How in the hell can you explain real estate going up 20% during a year when 20M people lost their jobs for at least some period of time?"
2021-06-23 10:15:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes thanks for the correction, was looking at the graph not the table."

2021-06-23 14:34:22,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you're wrong but it wouldn't be the play for me. Cash is cheap because the fed is printing free money, and supply can't meet demand. That to me doesn't rule out overpricing if financing is too lax. KBH doesn't care what happens after home is built, but the way I see things is that it takes months to build a house, and in that time the buyer could change their mind or lose financing if unofficial inflation checks people's true net cash flow. If you don't think this is serious risk, by all means. I do though."
2021-06-23 14:37:27,wallstreetbets,If that's the case then it sounds more like it really is a bubble.

I was aware of the fundamentals and the macroeconomic factors for housing therefore, and so when i saw the steep drop in homebuilding stocks, i researched the most undervalued ones based on fundamentals.

I also looked at the commodity prices for homebuilding, to see if that was the cause, but there was only good news there. 

So i decided to dive in on a stock that was trading cheaply compared to its peers, while having better PEG."

2021-06-23 12:04:28,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. New home sales for 2021 were above those of 2020... so despite COVID being ""over"", more new homes are selling (about 12% more).

All the macro stats, and LEN's earnings, point to good earnings for all the builders.

If the market thinks we're at the peak, though, could get ugly (even though I think this is kind of priced in -- see May price action). I think it will largely come down to positive guidance on the call to reassure the market this isn't a bubble, commodity prices don't matter, and they're seeing historic records of demand."
2021-06-23 10:43:52,wallstreetbets,Amen.
2021-06-23 14:53:21,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm a mortgage loan originator. Financing is not too lax. This isn‚Äôt the early 2000s where they were just giving homes to anybody. You have to have proof of income for the past two years to even qualify for a mortgage, and there are front-end and back-end ratios now that limit how much debt somebody can take on based on your total debt and proposed housing cost. Inflation just boosts the cost of commodities and homes. These cost are all transferred to the buyers. This stock might not go down again for years because of this."
2021-06-23 14:59:45,wallstreetbets,"No, it sounds more like average people are going to be at the heel of corporations and billionaires forever as long as we liberally spend driving down the value of their cash savings and driving up the value of assets. Rich people don‚Äôt hold cash during times of inflation they hold assets. That‚Äôs why they stay rich. These stimulus checks, pp loans, infrastructure bills, and all other budget deficit spending make regular people poorer while making the rich richer is the point."
2021-06-22 22:28:32,wallstreetbets,The interest rates are at basically nothing. Moving them up even a full % is not going to prevent people from buying homes in the slightest bit and that‚Äôs at least a year possibly two away. This trade has a long way to go. Furthermore people borrowing now are subject to way more scrutiny then 15 years ago which caused that meltdown. We are just going to have to disagree.

We know the short interest is there, in fact the shorts  have been cocky enough to publicly announce it in their lame attempts to manipulate the price lower, and their vague allegations of ""black market connections"" are silly af, and besides who wouldn't want to bet on the mobs favorite bookie?

The only thing this Molotov cocktail needs to set the shorts on fire is a spark and today at 3:30 Canada is expected to pass a final vote on single game sports betting.

This is more than solid as a long term hold as well, Sports betting is the next frontier, has already been legalized in 21 states and rule on the federal level is only a matter of time, and no company is in better position than $DNKG who has the lead in both branding and exposure to take over.

Calls are still cheap, and shares are at a discount, and now is the time to get in.

2021-06-22 22:14:41,wallstreetbets,"The Ishbia family owns 94% of the company.

One bear case is that they decide to cash out some (like the $30m Mat dumped over to his alma mater the moment lockup expired).

Another bear case would be future dilution via employee stock incentives (this is not a tech company and shouldn't be paying as if they are in this realm). They aren't yet, but the Ishbia family has already made it a point to spend investor money even before they receive it (in the form of stock options provided to every one of their staff as part of the SPAC merger).

Additional bear thesis regarding interest rates have been discussed.

Simply put, I don't trust management to return capital appropriately to shareholders long term. Short term, should be a fine buy.

Outside of the above two concerns, Mat just gives me way too much of a douchey financial services sales pitch feel.

I really hope Mat proves me wrong and y'all make lots of tendies.

2021-06-23 02:17:31,wallstreetbets,UWMC is very undervalued
2021-06-23 12:41:39,wallstreetbets,77% of their revenue is refinance. If interest rates rise rapidly then that revenue dries up quickly.
2021-06-22 20:33:31,wallstreetbets,"Uwmc benefits potentially more than Rocket in a high interest rate environment. But that doesn't mean it's an overall benefit. Mortgage origination volumes are at all time highs. Like 3x the normal amount. In high interest rate environments the increase in revenue of servicing rights, etc., for Uwmc will not be enough to offset the decrease in origination volume. 

Talking origination volume for Uwmc drops by roughly half, or more, from $180 billion to  $90 billion or so. That's the bear case. Which is bound to happen eventually. There can only be so many refinancings/house purchases. And originations are already starting to drop off.

Uwmc is still a solid company. At a minimum their dividend is very sustainable."

2021-06-23 02:52:32,wallstreetbets,A dividend is a way to shift part of a tax burden out of a company and onto its shareholders. Dividends also tend to make shareholders somewhat loyal to the company.
2021-06-23 01:00:22,wallstreetbets,"RKT' has no MOrtgage Servicing Right (MSR). Therefore RKT's business model relies heavily on refinancing mortgages. Which means, once interests rise, won't make anymore sense for people to refinance. By then, UWMC with MSR will basically rule the mortgage market. 

Not sure about others, but that's why I switched from RKT to UWMC"

2021-06-23 10:15:39,wallstreetbets,"sure, for KO."
2021-06-22 22:12:38,wallstreetbets,"Umm. Not really. MSRs are a small IO strip from the note that is not passed onto the note owner but retained by the servicer to cover the costs of servicing the loan. IOs have a negative duration as they are valued off the remaining principal of the note, which is less likely to be prepaid as rates rise. The longer the principal of the note is outstanding, the more interest is paid to the IO holder. Anyway, UWMCs balance of these did spike up last quarter, but usually (according to their CFO) they sell their servicing (and the MSR with it) on average after 6 months. Also most orignators/servicers hedge this risk. 

UWMCs position as to why they're insulated more than competitors to rising rates is that more of their business is purchase loans, which depend less on the economic necessity involved in refinancing. (most people don't refi into a higher rate).

I'm long UWMC because I believe they're the industry leader in digitizing the origination process, and they've leveraged that to lock in 3rd party brokers. Plus their CEO is an animal. The 4-5% dividend and massive (relative to public float) stock buyback doesn't hurt either."
2021-06-22 20:32:41,wallstreetbets,"This explanation adds to a bullish case for sure, so here‚Äôs some wild speculation, perhaps shorts or bears on UWMC took the Fed not raising rates as a bad sign for the company?"
2021-06-23 01:53:39,wallstreetbets,"Q1, loan servicing income was $124m:

https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Holdings-Corporation-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx



Annualized, $600m. At 6x = $3.6B. At 2x = $1.2B. Let‚Äôs say 4x? So $2.4B. 

That is also assuming flat for the year. Probably not as has grown a lot so far. Probably another x%. Let‚Äôs say 10% to be conservative. Can just apply that to the valuation for simplicity. So $2.6B. 


This is just the MSR portion of business. 


Not sure the rest. Any ideas?"
2021-06-23 01:44:52,wallstreetbets,Very interesting. Thanks for sharing
2021-06-23 11:08:46,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, that's not the way wall street modeling works. It's all discounted cash flows and projecting the future revenue of the company. Which makes sense. You're not gonna give a stock a valuation expecting record revenues indefinitely, especially when you know those revenues are coming from very unique times and things are expected to be significantly different only 1 to 2 years out. 

Also, while a drop off in house purchase volume is likely, at a minimum due to people being able to bid less on a house due to higher interest rates, it remains to be seen how much that will be. You're right there will also be a certain amount of new builds, people moving, etc. We are still in record times though and you can expect at least some decrease in that amount. 

Refinancings, however, will almost certainly drop off. Refinancings are pretty self explanatory, people only refinance at lower rates. With record lower rates now, when rates are raised later, first, there will be less people to refinance because so many of them have already done so and, second, there will be less of an incentive to refinance because the higher interest rate may not beat the prior one. 2020 refinancings were over half of the total mortgage origination volume, meaning refinancings are a majority of the volume in these record times.

Long story short, you basically have to assume Uwmc's origination volume will drop by at least half 1 to 2 years out. Their quarterly origination volume already decreased from the records 2020 quarters to Q1 2021. A significant decrease in origination volume is a given. It will happen eventually even if rates were to stay the same, if only because refinancings would eventually exhaust themselves.

Not saying Uwmc's a bad company. You just asked about the bear case. That's a main factor, we're in record origination times which will not be sustained a couple years out. 

Plus there's also the possibility they don't meet their expansion numbers for the mortgage broker wholesale channel/that channel actually shrinks due to rocket taking market share. Which is a definite possibility the way rocket targets retail. That's a whole nother post though. 

All that said, the bear case for me for Uwmc is still about $7. If only because the dividend, which is very sustainable, should support the price."
2021-06-23 12:36:08,wallstreetbets,"no offense, but, pretty sure you haven't thought deep enough about buying a house. 1% on a 500k mortgage matters a lot"
2021-06-22 21:03:04,wallstreetbets,"Ya just sounds overall solid. Makes money in all environments. Has best in class offerings like some posting mortg brokers said.

2021-06-22 21:48:01,wallstreetbets,"Also, Matt Ishba: [https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2021/06/10/uwm-says-itll-beat-rocket-mortgage-americas-largest-mortgage-lender-2024/7644819002/](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2021/06/10/uwm-says-itll-beat-rocket-mortgage-americas-largest-mortgage-lender-2024/7644819002/)

""We‚Äôre not like all the other mortgage companies,"" Ishbia told The Detroit News. ""We rely a lot less on refinances, and we're less cyclical. We're more scalable on technology."" To surpass the competition and do what no wholesale lender has done before, more homeowners have to do business with brokers, Ishbia and experts said. And the refinance market, where Rocket is particularly strong, has to shrink. ""If volumes do continue to increase, it favors Rocket more than UWMC, but if we get higher rates, that does favor the broker market on the origination side,"" said Kevin Heal, senior analyst for Argus Research Co. ""It's an ambitious goal. There's potential, yes, but you're relying on the broker market maintaining their independence."""

2021-06-23 01:46:40,wallstreetbets,Someone else was saying that increased rates will stabilize prices and that might mean that volume stays about the same for company like UWMC since they don‚Äôt rely on refinancing like RKT does.
2021-06-22 20:41:47,wallstreetbets,"Yes please, my fave flavor is sarcasm"
2021-06-23 09:05:35,wallstreetbets,"The crazy thing to think about too is the refinance business is slowing regardless. Anyone eligible/interested in refinancing has had 12+ months of historically low rates to do so, meaning the refi game is 'tapped out' to a certain extent and naturally slowing.

Increased rates + the looming end of forbearance forgiveness should in theory bring more supply to the housing market and help stabilize home prices as whole, which in turn will help buyers out a bit.

Watching people lose bids on properties when they offer $50k-$75k over asking is not sustainable but I don't see a housing market crash unless the entire economy goes first. Assuming that doesn't happen buyers will regain some leverage which should continue the volume for home buying."
2021-06-23 00:06:42,wallstreetbets,"#1 by volume. I personally know people who worked for them who hated it. They underpay their employees and take advantage of their customers. UWM does not need to be #1 in the market to succeed, they already have the recipe for success.

As far as the broker channel being smaller goes, that is because after the housing market collapsed last go around, these big banks/investment firms lobbied the shit out of the government to put the blame on brokers. Wall street and big banks got bailed out and brokers had the finger pointed at them for falsifying the housing market, as if they were the ones who came up with sub prime mortgages, and no doc ""stated"" loans.

This is basically the equivalent of hiring a car salesman to a used car lot that sells lemons, and then blaming the salesman for the cars breaking down.

The broker channel is coming back and with a vengeance this time. Companies like rocket utilize the broker channel to originate for them and then try to cut the broker out of future deals. That is not a recipe for long term success. It is a recipe to piss off your breadwinners. They pay inexperienced employees a fractional amount to work in call centers, and overcharge the borrowers.

UWM recognizes the resurgence of the broker industry and has committed to not only partnering with the broker outlet, but to actively promote it and help brokers sustain long term success. This is how you build a winning culture with committed and loyal business partners.

2) AMD is kicking Intel's butt. INTEL already lost it's the position in the global chip market, with AMD releasing new processors catered to only Gaming it's only a matter of time, AMD will dominate the chip market. 

3)

Technical standpoint AMD fall off from the $99 mark to 72 in 6 month's low on inflation. But AMD is one of those companies where it's Equity to dept ratio is high meaning, they have more business than they have debt. 

4) AMD is slowly building momentum in the smartphone processor market. Their processors are already 30-50% faster than the market's existing processors.

5) AMD's rival Nvidia is having hard time on the GPU market due to constant innovation and RND.

2021-06-22 22:42:57,wallstreetbets,"I'm still a little worried the stock may not hold the momentum after the EU approval, so I'm wondering if this should be a ""buy the rumor sell the news"" situation."
2021-06-22 23:47:11,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt blame you. I read some dd on all of that. It‚Äôs plausible. Give it 3weeks and I‚Äôm sure one of them will be confirmed
2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PRPL DD - Upon a Shitted Sheet I Sit [https://preview.redd.it/5p12zfokhu671.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=344a5ad70abe8f15c22032b5946e0bedde1c9f76](https://preview.redd.it/5p12zfokhu671.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=344a5ad70abe8f15c22032b5946e0bedde1c9f76)

$PRPL will hit Omicron Persei 8 within a few parsecs, and here's the goddamn reasons why:

Much like myself whom has failed to meet any goals in life, $PRPL has failed to meet their EPS estimate for 2 quarters in a row now. So why buy?

* They've been rolling out new products since their last earnings. Marked as ‚Äúthe greatest fucking pillow‚Äù (yahoo finance, mostly) ever made, Purple has released their line of summer pillows, touching on a very open market of ‚Äúcool pillows‚Äù which help maintain airflow and stay cool
* My dick is larger than your wife's boyfriend's wife's. Don't be mad, retard brain = strong arms and big dick.
* [https://preview.redd.it/22gs1hcohu671.jpg?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e0210e924f73ef4ad6dad14151924018beb0dc4](https://preview.redd.it/22gs1hcohu671.jpg?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e0210e924f73ef4ad6dad14151924018beb0dc4)
* A new manufacturing plant in Georgia is starting to ramp up production. They won‚Äôt be throwing peaches or the most deranged strippers you‚Äôve ever seen into their product line, but this will help them move more products daily
* They have a cool product line! Proprietary manufacturing aside, these sheets and pillows feel and are amazing.
* My Pillow guy canceled, RIP.

So lets talk more about numbers, those things that look like letters but only spell a few words like BOOBIES and only when you turn the calculator upside down.

* In 2020 we watched net revenue increase from $428.4 million to $648.5 million (51.4% increase).
* Operating income (profit after deducting operating expenses you idiot) increased from $16.2 million to $71.2 million (a 339.3% increase, remember that new manufacturing site I mentioned before?)
* So far this year the stock has seen a 19.7% decrease in it‚Äôs price, important for later, read below.

This stock hit a low last week in the mid to high $20 range. We can partially blame this on the possibly gay director (Pano Anthos) of the company selling off 7,735 shares as well as more insider selling of 15,534 shares. So why is this important? $PRPL has now entered oversold territory. Evidenced by a current RSI (really sweet information) rating of 28.7. We can assume here that investors will be expecting this recent sell off to be exhausting itself and seeing the current price as a great entry point.

[https://preview.redd.it/x8f6tbnrhu671.gif?format=mp4&s=ad2028fb559b4b0827f6a3c29d69cdd4d51c6459](https://preview.redd.it/x8f6tbnrhu671.gif?format=mp4&s=ad2028fb559b4b0827f6a3c29d69cdd4d51c6459)

Since you're all a special kind of disabled lately, let's talk about it: Short interest. Short interest on this stock is currently at 3,430,000 shares. Now (and this is important) short interest has decreased 14.3% over the past month. This stock is fire and there‚Äôs no reason (as evidenced in the drop) to be shorting it at this time, which is why the shorts are closing positions. PRPL is about to go thermonuclear and possibly global to boot.

With retail reopening, increased production and new product lines we‚Äôre going to see a great year for earnings. If you're drooling and it's not into a PRPL pillowcase you're a dirty poor.

2021-06-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLUG, WKHS, RUN, VWDRY These are some of the companies I like best. 

They have all been doing well, and I expect they all have huge potential as we slowly transition to a greener future.

Plug power is a hydrogen fuel cell company with great potential for clean energy. They have also been doing well financially with the stock price going from $5 to $60 in the time I‚Äôve had shares. Currently at $30ish.

Workhorse is an electric vehicle company. I think they are well placed to take a section of the future of the market.

Sunrun is a solar power producer. 

Vestas wind systems is a huge wind power company. Based in Copenhagen, VWDRY is their American arm.

Hope some of you all choose to invest in these green companies. Do good for the planet and make some money while you‚Äôre at it!"

2021-06-22 21:32:29,wallstreetbets,I don't think they made that statement in an effort to drive up the value of their company. I think they are just trying to cover their ass from any potential lawsuits. They are acknowledging the volatility of their stock and warning investors.

2021-06-23 18:24:10,wallstreetbets,Bought at $23 before the dip to $18 and I‚Äôm still holding
2021-06-23 11:37:40,wallstreetbets,It was my favorite stock to swing for awhile. VZIO is a sleeper. Literally the most boring ticker ever for no reason.
2021-06-22 22:26:37,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-23 18:22:53,wallstreetbets,Announce what. The MODs reached out to me and verified the post.
2021-06-23 11:39:00,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs just how the market is  I guess only the known brands get volume everything else is a sleeper, any other you have seen like that?"
2021-06-23 08:16:10,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, not literally. I keep forgetting that I'm a mod now and saying that has more weight now than when I used to say it."
2021-06-23 12:32:14,wallstreetbets,"NTLA is a solid swing if you get it in the low 70s or high 60s usually goes up to mid/high 80s within a week but I‚Äôve traded her since she was my $11 baby. ME ipo is in a good range but needs more volume. Maxar is solid but just jumped to 40, but that‚Äôs one to hold on to. Regardless of how ppl feel about vizio they‚Äôre still a household name, the stock is still affordable I don‚Äôt really see the problem. Support and resistance has changed for a lot of tickers so I‚Äôm holding on to PLTR.

Edit: just my opinion not financial advice. I know literally nothing and just say things."

2021-06-22 21:43:50,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm extremely bearish on BB long term. I don‚Äôt think it will crash right now so am not holding puts but BB will never figure it out. 

There‚Äôs something wrong with their management or culture, guys. They have only managed to grow in size 1 of the past 10 years. This is during the greatest run for technology companies of ALL TIME! Think about that for a second. They shrunk while virtually every other tech company on the planet was growing rapidly. Look at these revenue figures:

2021	893

2020	1,040

2019	904

2018	932

2017	1,309

2016	2,160

2015	3,335

2014	6,813

2013	11,073

2012	18,423

2011	19,907


BB is a tech company that cannot compete with other tech companies. They don‚Äôt have the organizational competence. They will get bullied out of every business they‚Äôre in by more competent competition. They will get knocked off of every position. 

BB is a dead horse and always will be."

2021-06-22 21:32:16,wallstreetbets,The pricing of royalties per share is highly competitive and makes it extremely difficult for another company to step in. The numbers will continue to grow with the extreme competitive pricing. Plus they will be continuing to dump unprofitable assets that  are currently driving revenue down.

I know everyone is gung-ho about the patent sale, but that news got priced in back in December when it was first announced. Unless Facebook gives them a mountain of gold and a pony for each employee, that won't affect the stock price an awful lot.

I was a BB bagholder from January till June - I doubled my money when I sold at $19.50 on that beautiful morning :) so I'm not some random shill. I get that there are lots of articles about BB winning different industry awards, etc, but those things don't bring in sales - at least not right away.

Do your own DD. Listen to the previous earnings calls. (Or read the transcripts but that's, like, not authentic, man. :P ) As someone who spent many hours researching BB, I think the Thursday earnings will fall within the expected range, perhaps lower. They will not propel you to the moon.

BB will be a $30 stonk eventually, but not next week or next month. I'll buy in on the dip - I've been swing-trading it for the last few weeks, and closed all my positions ahead of the earnings.

Good luck."

I know my country and just wanted to criticize in OP‚Äôs DD regarding 2 of the ‚Äòrisks‚Äô. The Government is very stable and a working democracy. With Covid the country‚Äôs GDP plummeted because the main income for the country is tourism followed by mining and fishing. Being an african 2nd world country, there is a lot of corruption which in this case is a good thing. If you have the support of the Government, your businessplan is untouchable. The people running the company really know what they‚Äôre doing running unique social engineering supports (the latest being the N$15 mil covid vaccination support). The activists and environmentalists will never stop this company from succeeding if the government sees green. Im super bullish and ill be happy if Namibia benefits from a great discovery.

So far they've only made moves that are ridiculously good for the future like the hiring of Amazon execs and Ryan Cohen. The stock moons like a nuclear rocket any time there's good news. I don't know if buying at $300+ is a great move because of the history of dipping hard but it's as close to guaranteed money around $200 as it gets.

2021-06-22 22:40:04,wallstreetbets,"Unless you're highly anticipating the value of said stock to increase exponentially, and healthily surpass that of the strike price, I'd say swing trading contracts is the better play, rather than holding them and then executing them. But, I also barely know what I'm doing. Swinging options can make good money but can lose good money. They can basically be scratch off tickets for those of us who don't exactly understand the fundamentals behind all of it, like me! So before you go down that road, either make sure you're okay with watching that money disappear, or be very confident and understand how options work."
2021-06-22 21:39:11,wallstreetbets,Example I bought rkt 23c for $10ea it jumped to like $34 that's 11x100 so I sold each contract for $1100. If I wanted to make that with shares my initial cost to buy 100 shares would of been like $2000
2021-06-23 04:05:26,wallstreetbets,I remember the first time having the option of sleeping on the couch or sleeping on the side of the bed wifes bf accidently spilled a glass of water . Life was better b4 those options.

2021-06-23 12:29:34,wallstreetbets,"well, I guess I would say that the options charts show thousands of PUT and CALL options ITM at any given time for those 2 stocks which clearly aren't expiring worthless.  I've made money on PUT options for AMC. 

Options sometimes pay off and sometimes do not.  But if you think CLOV is going to stay at $13+ or go higher after the hype dies down, well.. good luck to you."
2021-06-23 13:31:29,wallstreetbets,So sounds like a good long investment with the potential of a squeeze. I can see that
2021-06-22 20:37:40,wallstreetbets,But that would also mean we‚Äôre both rich bc WISH made you relapse so that would maybe make you a happy beard that wouldn‚Äôt make me fearful üòÉ
2021-06-22 23:47:21,wallstreetbets,I agree there. Wish is carving out an interesting niche in e-commerce. The gamification/casino-esque nature of their site could turn into something big.

2021-06-23 12:34:19,wallstreetbets,"just to clarify - you can buy and sell PUT or CALL options as long as you have the money for it and the buy level in your brokerage account.  

If you *write* an option then you either need to have the 100 shares (CALL options) or the cash to back up the purchase of the shares (PUT options).  Most brokerages (I think) won't even allow you to do this otherwise. 

I've never written a PUT option. I wrote a CALL option once but it never got assigned despite being ITM for some time."
2021-06-22 20:16:41,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-23 13:22:21,wallstreetbets,"That's why I sell calls. Hype dies down, call and put value die down."
2021-06-23 13:46:42,wallstreetbets,This is why I‚Äôm in calls and shares. The calls are for pure profit which I don‚Äôt have the funds to fulfill these when the hit expiration date. I also have shares from $11.05 that I‚Äôm going to hold until people realize this is going to be as big as Etsy. Just hoping it‚Äôs sooner rather than later so my calls go up and I can finally afford my lambo.

Most other brokerages charge an options fee for each option contract. Robinhood technically doesn‚Äôt. Instead they build in their fee into the options price. So whatever you see on the Robinhood app is the price you pay."
2021-06-22 21:00:42,wallstreetbets,"Holy moly, you are very confused or very mistaken. To be fair, so is the person you're replying to."

2021-06-22 21:47:42,wallstreetbets,"So what if the call meets or exceeds the strike price before the expiration date?

And if you keep holding hoping for it to move further up and it then ends up dropping below the strike price at expiration?

If you don‚Äôt mind me asking. Sorry, maybe a dumb question"
2021-06-22 21:40:06,wallstreetbets,Ah!!! That why I have no idea what that is. I don‚Äôt have Robinhood level 2. I barely know what I am doing. LOL

2021-06-22 21:02:19,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-22 21:04:06,wallstreetbets,Please tell me what I'm confused about.  I've sold lots of puts. My post is the way I understand it.
2021-06-22 21:57:33,wallstreetbets,"For calls, you want the stock price to exceed the option strike price as much as possible, that will naturally provide the most profit. If it only meets the strike price, that's actually kinda bad and you still lose your premium. In the example you spent $170 for literally nothing.

The math works like this. In the example I used, the strike price ($422) PLUS the premium price $1.70 ($170 divided by 100) is called the break even price. So technically ANYTHING $423.70 or less is a waste. BUT if it finished at $424.70 (one dollar above break even) the option would be worth about $270.

This is also based on time. If it ran above the strike the day you purchase the option, that would provide the greatest benefit, because you have so much time left in the option. But if you hold it, and hold it, and hold it, and then it goes below the break even price (or even worse the strike price) then the option expires worthless. So you would lose the premium paid (in the example $170).

There are three ways to close an option.

1: Sell it to someone else (hopefully for a profit, or if it hits your stop loss/risk tolerance)

2: Exercise the option (Buy 100 shares at the strike price, this is dependent on whether or not you want the shares, and if you have enough capital to cover the cost of 100 shares)

3: Option expires worthless and you lose your premium (stock price closes at the end of the option date below the strike price).


Something like 90% of options expire worthless. Options are high risk, high reward"
2021-06-22 21:06:08,wallstreetbets,"Having 100 shares would put you at a double negative should the underlying price decrease. You're thinking of selling calls against your shares. You don't sell puts against shares. You could short the underlying shares and then sell a put, much the same as a covered call, but inverse. I think The commenter above was confused about selling the contract, and thinking he meant sell to open."
2021-06-22 21:26:23,wallstreetbets,"The person above you was talking about selling his contract he bought and was holding, not selling to open."
2021-06-22 22:03:16,wallstreetbets,"Right on, I‚Äôve just been getting my feet wet trying to learn as much as I can. But this helped a lot, thank you for your reply."

2021-06-23 03:34:03,wallstreetbets,the rest are synthetic
2021-06-23 07:34:06,wallstreetbets,"Theory is this.  Hedge Funds that are short on GME have been borrowing stock from ETFs at low interest rates since there are none available on the market.  They use these to suppress the reported price.  There is also off-market activity driving the price down as well with these shares.  The problem is, people on a global level buy the dip, they buy the tip, they buy the rip and everything in between.  And Hold.

A new problem arises.  These borrowed shares cannot be returned, so a Fail-to-Deliver situation becomes massive.  To fix this, sentiment is, market makers are marrying ""shares"" with deep ITM calls/puts.  These go back the ETFs that they were borrowed from and close down or lighten the FTD issue.

So by doing so, shares are being created out of thin air, and have been since January.  Gobble gobble.  The available float to retail was around 27 million.  Apes (that were able to) vote, voted with shares owned as of 4/5 or 4/15, we suspect the amount of votes was many times the available actual amount of shares.  So forget gamma squeeze, we're dealing with fail-to-deliver squeezes which drives the FLOOR up.  If you zoom out on the GME chart you'll see the floor raise from 150-160, to 180-190, to 210-220... In between those floors are large spikes where shorts need to try to cover positions and cook their books.  Ape holds on spikes and dips.

Apes have been buying since April vote count.  And holding.

Also, the CEO did not sell shares until he had the vote count in-hand.  So from my perspective, Ryan Cohen sold 5 million real shares into a market that is completely overwhelmed with synthetic shares.

Each share I own may need to be bought 5-10x over to settle everything.  So basically GME is safer than gold.  This, IMO, differentiates it from movie stocks and other short-interest plays.  Supply and Demand.  I have cash-backed, non-loanable Class A shares.  I sit and wait.  It is the opposite of typical WSB YOLO quick cash.

This is attrition.  Imagine seeing the price dropping from 350 to 190 in 15 minutes.  And holding.  Then buying more.  Those that went through that are the ones holding currently, and there isn't much scaring these people off of the stock.  There are no paper hands left.  I do expect a lot of incoming FOMO again.  It's a black hole."

2021-06-23 04:55:17,wallstreetbets,"No *long-term* debt.

They still have some liabilities, but only what you'd expect"

Yup.. uh huh.. Right there with ya fellow ape. Actually COMPLEATING a puzzle? nah... I'm still collecting pieces!"
2021-06-23 06:02:04,wallstreetbets,"Essentially because of corporate personhood. Toys R Us borrowed money from the triumvirate of hedge funds/venture capital firms to buy out their shareholders, and then paid those hedge funds interest on that debt, eating into their profit margin at a time when they should've been innovating in order to maintain their sector leading advantage.

Instead, they shut down their website to push traffic to Amazon as just another seller on there. Not the best move in hindsight."

2021-06-22 23:25:04,wallstreetbets,"No, he sold like $10 million in calls the first time. Yes he reinvested most of if but has enough to take care of his family for life and would be fine even if GME crashed to like $80. You're trying to compare a millionaire to most people here who probably own like 10 shares max."
2021-06-22 23:01:33,wallstreetbets,"Because that was a great option for him. You think if he only had shares that he wouldn't have sold some to lock in profits that secured his family's finances for the rest of their lives? DFV's thesis was never about the short squeeze to begin with, he just saw an undervalued company. Obviously after selling $10 million in calls he can afford to hold his shares but anyone who's not as well off as him and especially those that are YOLOing their life savings into this are straight up dumb as shit if they're not locking in gains or increasing their shares on easy plays.

Edit: Want to add in the common saying on WSB, ""Pigs get slaughtered."" Jan was basically the time when everyone thought the squeeze was 100% guaranteed and look at what happened. Corporations and brokers pulled the shadiest shit and left tons of people as bagholders. Now the squeeze is still possible but not as likely as it was in Jan and people still haven't learned that nothing in life is guaranteed."
2021-06-22 23:21:50,wallstreetbets,"The reality of life is that every stock has people who hold and people who play the game. You can either be someone who gets taken advantage of by others or you can worry about your own financial wellbeing. Everyone else out there profiting on every single stock including GME doesn't give a fuck about your finances or if you lose it all. You and your family are the only ones that'll suffer if you end up losing your savings. It's a nice thought to think ""yeah, everyone in this is gonna hold and I can't lose because I'm holding for them!"" but that's not reality. Whether you hold through every dip or not isn't gonna make a fuck a bit of difference in the grand scheme of things in a game played by billion dollar corporations and super computers. Reddit only makes up a fraction of those who hold GME anyways. If you held through every crash so far since the beginning you would already know this. You do you though. Pigs get slaughtered."
2021-06-23 06:23:14,wallstreetbets,You think bb is going to drop tomorrow? What if they report good earnings? Not really seeing any crazy rises in price so it not like we are seeing a bunch of people buying to sell before the earnings release to take advantage of the hype

a) invest in a cinema franchise that has a 1:5 ratio of asset to liability and all other similar companies have gone bankrupt

b) invest in a retailer that's pivoting into a tech company in the largest entertainment market sector with the intention of competing with Amazon

I'm fucking fed up of AMC, there's just so much risk to assume by purchasing that stock. The fact that anybody bought it just straight up demonstrates complete obliviousness to GME."

If you have a jar of water with some cracks in the bottom... the water flows out. And if an institution decides to shoot a bullet at the jar? It's not a question of if, but when.

The company has STILL failed to demonstrate substantial value portfolio projections for the long term. Business as normal is NOT a valid strategy for AMC by this point.

When this actually squeezes it'll be easy to tell because we'll have halts and jumps of like $50-100 every 5 minutes again.

It's extremely stupid for people who make money on stocks to not sell some at some point and turn it into actual money that can feed your family. You realize that it's just numbers on a screen until you sell right? You know what the common theme among those who end up losing everything in the stock market is? They get greedy and think that their stocks will only go up permanently. I never said you had to sell all your GME, all I said was to learn to take profits and protect yourself. If you're not doing the bare minimum most basic fucking concept of being in the stock market, then yeah, you are dumb as shit."

2021-06-23 00:15:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I feel bad writing it but if you look at the front page right now the problem with the sub is not that there are too few submissions.  It's that most of them are complete shit and I don't have the patience to read through all of it to find where people actually know what they're talking about.  Too many posts written by people who don't know anything.  I'm not trying to group you in there, but the point is it's too much effort to sort the good from the bad.

I noticed you're in ASO, so am I.  And I've done a tremendous amount of my own due diligence on it, and I've even written it up, without posting it, because the sub doesn't need more ASO DD.  Frankly it needs less.

Sometimes less is more.  Quality over quantity.

Just my opinion, anyway."

2021-06-23 08:57:33,wallstreetbets,"Haha yeah it's hard to come across an actual good discussion on this sub anymore.

And yes Biden specified he wanted a 100% electric federal fleet, but hasn't specified the time frame because of course, this level of production is quite the feat. 

In the case of Oshkosh, I do believe they are also a company with good balance sheets that you can make money from, however I still wouldn't be certain that the USPS contract goes in their favour. 

One could argue that with the infrastructure already in place, it would make production easier, but in Workhorse's defence, without the experience and knowledge in constructing EV's, Oshkosh of course are going to run into a lot of errors in the production of the fleet if they do not partner up with anyone with said experience.

You can look at it both ways, the level of infrastructure that is required for that level of production takes a while to acquire, as well as the knowledge, research and development which take a while to acquire, which up until this point Workhorse has been doing with their products. WKHS can also easily establish that level of infrastructure over the next few years given the right amount of budget (aka the USPS contract).

Not to be a typical conspiracist, but I do also believe something shady has been going on in the background regarding Oshkosh and the USPS board hence why they are under investigation.

If you do have any of the sources that counter-argue any of my points please by all means show me so that I can make a more informed investment decision :)

And in terms of short-term catalyst for a squeeze, wsb history has shown me that fundamental catalysts aren't always a requirement for a squeeze, it's just a bet and that's what we're here for. But since my DD, the utilisation still remains around 100% and cost to borrow has doubled, also the new SEC rule is in place today.

Apologies, I would've written a more comprehensive argument but my day job is suffering because I frequent reddit too much!"
2021-06-23 10:00:49,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree that at the end of the day, this is a bet and I'll add that because most of the suit on both sides is just speculation the result just comes down to opinion.

Here is a video showing two years ago that USPS trucks were already wanting a redesign. I know there are sources going back about 5-10 years, but those have all been overshadowed by the new development and this is the only one I remembered well enough to be searchable by name:
https://youtu.be/6oDVsf29tyk

This article has nothing to do with my points but it's a really funny satire piece:
https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a35617691/the-new-usps-trucks-so-much-for-looking-cool-while-you-deliver-the-mail/

Here is the USPS themselves describing the contract without mention any part electric:
https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2021/0223-multi-billion-dollar-modernization-of-postal-delivery-vehicle-fleet.htm

Here is the original contract announcement and it does not specify or even imply electric vehicles:
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2020/19-002-R20.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiRzsuQ8a3xAhVIrZ4KHfK0DigQFjAAegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw1WI1ktW9sg9h0kCjFS54Yt

Biden's announcement came out in January and while I believe in his plan, being that presidents be er actually achieve what they set out for he might just look at 20% of federal vehicles not being electric:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/01/28/biden-federal-fleet-electric/%3foutputType=amp

Here is Oshkosh saying that a few billion more would lead to a mostly electric fleet:
https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300281/usps-new-mail-truck-ev-electric-workhorse-biden-dejoy

The rest of what I said was opinionated and I would also like to add that we are doubting Oshkosh on its ability to follow through, but I think Workhorse deserve the same, if not more, scrutiny. What if workhorse never makes good on their promise and doubles or triples the deadline or also asks for billions more? This problem is inherent to the fact that Workhorse doesn't have the contract so we can't know what stipulations they might have because of course they would never start presenting a case against themselves while trying to win back a contract."

I have to think refiners are the.winners here as oil price arbitrage opens up while demand keeps refined product prices elevated.  If this dents Brent prices, it might hit the international oil and gas names that are moving on the $100/bbl hype.  Adding Iranian production back into the mix puts a lid on that scenario. 

What is the likelihood that Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait pump like mad to depress prices and keep the Iranians in check and block their ability to get north of $70/bbl for their production.  Not likely the local players are going to sit idle while their major foe rebuilds its economy."

At a glance, it looks like TRCH is a worthless company which is looking to fuck over the shorts who (rightly) predict they'll be out of business soon, so they're doing some convoluted deal with a dividend of non-tradeable preferred shares (?) which is confusing and hard to evaluate and anyone with experience realizes well enough to stay away.

The best place to have it is in leveraged real estate, and after that, in other equities. So putting money into the market right now is not a horrible idea. 

When the FOMC begins raising interest rates, there will likely be some frothiness to the market, but it isn't going to turn belly-up just because of that. That's not to say that the markets might not turn upside down at some point, but it'll be for some other reason. Something that we aren't foreseeing at this point."

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7toe74/a_serious_wsj_warning_today/

People did have *valid concerns* regarding a possible ""impending crash."" People were worried about P/Es, they were worried about all-time-highs, they were worried about the presidential election, they were worried about the stimulus, they were worried about have far down the market would go during the Covid crash, etc.

If the market crashes tomorrow, I'll just buy more. You might be right that a drop will come in 1-2 years. It remains to be seen if the market stays down."

2021-06-23 17:24:45,stocks,Yes I understand how shorts work. What I am saying is the amount of people still pumping money in thinking there is some massive upside. After the '08 crash if you had cash on hand you could make a profit on literally any stock as the market recovered.
2021-06-23 17:44:00,stocks,Yes blue chip stocks exist for a reason with a decent dividend. Funnel money into them. Not arguing against that but all this craze on general stocks is terrifying.

2021-06-23 17:36:06,stocks,Ahh i misunderstood. What do you define as a correction? And why is it obvious? Cause id argue last week was a correction for most of the market. But im assuming you think its going to be significantly larger? And correct me if im wrong but if you pull your money out and inflation happens that stack of cash you pulled out will be worth less then after the correction anyway.

2021-06-23 17:51:10,stocks,"Okay but if you pulled all of your money out and are holding it as cash for fear of a market downturn over the next couple of years then you aren‚Äôt even an investor at that point. You‚Äôll just be losing money anyways because of inflation eating away at the value of your cash. You‚Äôre letting fear and paranoia drive your actions. You should take your inflation concerns and weigh them in with fundamental analysis of overall markets to get ahead of the masses. If you were right, wonderful for you! If not, have risk management and learn from it. Having cash during a time of inflation is like slowly burning your money away dollar by dollar."
2021-06-23 17:47:05,stocks,and what happens to your buying power in an inflationary environment genius?
2021-06-23 19:42:14,stocks,"Oh good.  So the US Treasury is the only entity that can print money.  Most people hear the Fed is printing money and think of German or Venezuelan hyperinflation where treasuries printed money into oblivion; that is not what the Fed is doing now or after GFC.  

Inflation fluctuates; the Fed thinks CPI will oscillate to the higher end of its range by 2023, at which point it will start raising rates and flattening the yield curve.  Routine.

I‚Äôve worked in HNW asset management since 2004; right now is full bull mode.  We are on the cusp of early stage recovery moving into mid-stage expansion; it‚Äôs actually kind of routine. That being said there is one 1x 10-20% correction per year on average, so expect that.

I also don‚Äôt know where your getting the insolvency thing, saving are through the roof.  

So long story short that is why people ~~are~~aren‚Äôt cashing out right now."
2021-06-23 17:42:34,stocks,"Correction meaning that 10-20% across the board for 2-3 months, not a week swing. Look at today how the DOW went. Not just one industry. Of course there will always be some winners. The market overall is in for a correction, its historically proven and now there are things we have never before seen happening. 

&#x200B;

Those things happen to be collapsing mass funds which judgement says...... won't bode well for stability."
2021-06-23 17:59:54,stocks,I'd argue against this completely having liquid assets to move freely across different investment vehicles does not mean you are not an investor.
2021-06-23 17:51:55,stocks,"Well if the current thesis holds true and people are in stocks and they all get corrected and lose 10-30% value and you hold cash..... You inflation is 10% You may net neutral? So evens out? Or it goes further in the market and information doesn't hit as hard and now you have buying power. 

So as you questioned I guess I'd say, Cash is king because the market can wipe your buying power out faster than inflation can."

2021-06-23 17:41:34,stocks,"The biggest mistake new traders make is not planning their exits. There should be a trigger for exiting to take profit and a trigger for exiting at a loss. Don't let the profits ride (don't get greedy), don't let a losing trade keep losing more money with the hope it'll turn profitable.

If you set up your trades correctly, you'll know exactly how much you'll make if you're right and how much you'll lose if you're wrong. There should really be no question here.

It's amazing how many people I see posting here and other investing/trading subs asking if they should take their profit yet or if they should take their loss. That's something you need to think about *before you enter the trade*.

This also helps take all emotion out of the equation if you are disciplined enough to stick with your plan."

Then again pennystocks is kinda uhh, so much extra risk, mining companies can have their permits declined, which renders the entire company absolutely useleless, medical stocks with actual products can still go down more than 90%, not to talk about all medical stocks who doesn't get their crap approved or can't distribute it into medical field, or company can decide to do so much stock offering/dillution that they raise few hundred mils from retail investors while earning few mils a year.

I view it as an ""invest and forget it"" stock given it's low volatility and high divided, but in that case VOO or VTI would be the better option.

Look at it this way, the deal was announced and the stock has basically traded flat. That tells you there‚Äôs a lot of wait and see going on here from larger institutional investors, aka, the smart money. They‚Äôre holding, so why shouldn‚Äôt you?

They‚Äôre holding because, for the time being, there is a very solid dividend that isn‚Äôt changing prior to the the deal closing. How many high dividends do you know that are basically guaranteed not to be slashed before mid 2022 at the earliest, with a stable stock price? 

Then there‚Äôs the upside. T is shedding debt, slimming down, and focusing on their core business. This is exactly what the street and large investors have wanted. Plus, they still get 71% of the high growth streaming business, which is considerably more valuable than just HBO Max alone. 

The new company could command a high valuation given that it will be a big theee streaming competitor‚Äîif you like Netflix and Disney, Warner-Discovery will be right up there. 

I bought into T believing that the company was more valuable than its stock price based on the sum of its parts. Now that value is being unlocked. 

We‚Äôll see what the new stock ends up trading at, but I‚Äôm putting my money on T and NewCo being valued more than T was alone. It seems the market agrees it‚Äôs a reasonable possibility."

i think the warnermedia spinoff has a real chance to be a successful company, as there's a lot of valuable  IP's in there.

it  sucks that the dividend is getting slashed, but my plan is to simply hold what i've got, enjoy the  next year or so worth of dividends, and then see what happens post  spinoff.

i'm reasonably confident things will be successful for both att and the warner spinoff (my understanding is that T holders basically see their shares split into T and the new  company, so current holders will have both), but uncertain enough i'm not necessarily adding to my position.

only way i'd sell off is if it has an insane run between now and then and starts trading for $40-$50/share (which won't happen)"

What I am saying is: If you're going to be profitable within 24 months everyone wants a piece of the pie, but if you're going to be wildly profitable in 2025 it is hard for institutions to invest *now*, which is most of the money.

Sportradar will be IPOing soon, and depending on the valuation I would much rather have Sportradar.

> Not only are they partnered with the NFL but $GENI won the exclusive distribution rights for NFL official data in April. They beat out their only main competitor, Sportradar.

They won by paying a princely sum for it, ~3x the $40m Sportradar was paying and they're paying for half of that in equity. I get that growth is coming but that literally represents 90% of their PY Sales revenue.

Agree there's no bear case in the OPs statement, but I personally can't see any reason to want SR either. GENI's basically got all the major sports partnerships (US and abroad) and they've been on an spending spree to position themselves well for the next few years. They've more than funded themselves for that spending with share dilution recently, including 8m shares from mgmt (which is insane unless you already know you're gonna make more than you would have without that dilution).

I can't see the same for SR who seems to be losing their battles left, right and center. They lost the NFL contract and tried to go SPAC at 10b lol."
2021-06-23 18:37:14,stocks,"I am welcome to bear cases, I apologize I didn‚Äôt include them in my dd.

While sportradar does plan on a traditional ipo, geni is the only option at the moment so what I said isn‚Äôt false although it doesn‚Äôt look like for long. If sport radar can get a decent valuation I will buy some of that as well as they represent a duopoly in the market. If the valuation is the same as when they planned on spac route (10 bn) I will not touch it. So we will see if the spac valuation experiment taught them anything.

They did pay alot of money for the NFL contract but I do not see this as negative either. A lot of companies have loss leaders and if this is what this turns out to be than that‚Äôs ok. NFL is great exposure and with their model they should be able to fully entrench themselves into that ecosystem. On top of that this is included in that deal:

**Another element of the partnership with Genius Sports gives the company the right to distribute live audiovisual game feeds to sportsbooks in international markets, while it will also represent the NFL‚Äôs legalised sports betting advertising inventory across the league‚Äôs owned and operated digital platforms domestically and internationally.**

Geni gets 5% of all revenue from sports books using their data so will be able to make money internationally off this deal. I will admit I don‚Äôt know how much of an appetite there is for NFL outside of North America though."

And while there are some shady companies (Luckin Coffee) those always fisl eventually much like Enron did in the US. People notice the flaws and gossip starts spreading well ahead of the crash. If you buy solid ones like Baba you can ser first hand the buisness is there.



China is world leading in Nuclear and in solar. They're also good at importing American waste hence they get a bad rep, most of their ""pollution"" and waste is from other countries. And yes they do use coal and similar but at away quickly unlike US which needs oil/gas to keep unskilled workers happy in Texas and similar states. Without oil/gas there will be a lot of ""macho men"" suddenly unemployed and unhirable due to lack of relevant skills/education.




Investing in China is a risk. A risk that is offset by major premiums for any investor. I'd never go all in, but having 5-10% in good Chinese stocks has treated me very well. If it goes to 0 tomorrow I've still profited."

They have got an enormous cash position and they still have some products in the pipeline that *could* make money in the future.
Their current valuation is extremely low, but more professional analysts give the company a price target of it at 85 euros for the end of the year.

The expert: What happens in the banks is a mystery - usually foreshadows a crash

 The US banks' overnight deposits with the Fed have exploded and are currently even larger than the central bank's support purchases.  Exactly why the banks do not dare to sit on the money overnight is shrouded in obscurity, says investment bank Carlsquare's Anders Elgemyr to DI TV.
 - This is a typical reaction that usually happens in the crashes, he says.
 Elgemyr emphasizes that the Fed and perhaps also the Riksbank know what is going on - but the markets have no idea.
 Even if the concern continues, it is a buying situation because the Fed will go in and save the markets, he tells DI.

Often these stocks don‚Äôt have analyst coverage, so there‚Äôs a pretty tried and true pattern. Invest in a company with solid fundamentals, the stock eventually appreciates, then comes analyst coverage, and then it appreciates more as it gets noticed. Depending on your plan, you can either exit then or continue to hold. 

A couple small cap stocks which I have large positions in: 
- $UAN. A nitrogen based fertilizer company. Looking for at least a double from here as fertilizer prices are expected to remain extremely high due to low supply, high crop prices, and China potentially limiting exports on urea. There‚Äôs some great research on it both on Reddit and Seeking Alpha. (1000 share position)

- $QRHC. A nano cap waste management company who has successfully completed a turnaround and is now back in growth mode. There is a good write up on r/securityanalysis. (5000 share position)

- $NWARF (Actually I own the ticker on my local exchange in Norway). Norwegian Air, their balance sheet is now significantly improved and they are ready for travelgeddon. (10000 shares).

I have positions in other medium cap stocks including $CF (300 shares) $AYX (300 shares) and $STMP (100 shares) but these are not as small/overlooked as the others."

2021-06-23 11:11:35,stocks,"Disney is a long-term stick to hold‚Ä¶not one likely to make you rich or anything, but one to beat the market perhaps.  They have plans with their parks but it takes many years to realize those plans, so anything on that front is slow-growing.  The parks did reopen but you have to see what happened since they closed.  They list a lot of revenue from the parks closing, while doing very well with their film and licensing acquisitions.  So Disney plus sort of made up for a lot of that to keep the stock from really going down a lot during the pandemic.  

The acquisitions they have made have been very smart, in my opinion, and what that will translate to is the parks regaining their income flow as a base for which the films and licensing are the X factor.  They have recently done a very successful crossover with Sea of Thieves.  It is not the kind of thing to likely yield them a ton of cash, but it is the kind of success to likely make them reconsider their front as a gaming outlet in collaboration or by themselves.  

In short, I think Disney long-term is a good stock that will likely go up and has the capacity to beat the market‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just not a gangbusters stock that is going to make you a ton of wealth.  But it also comes with a lot less risk than other ventures.  The mouse has shown resilience for a lot of years.  Good purchase in my opinion."

But then I did  a google search and found two sites where the wording is strange and is probably the reason for OP's question.  For example from this [Yahoo finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-announces-4-1-stock-121421565.html):

>The split is conditional on approval from shareholders at the company‚Äôs Annual Meeting to be held on June 3. Upon approval of the split, each shareholder of Nvidia *as of June 21*, will receive a stock dividend of 3 additional common shares for every share held. The shares are to be distributed after the close of trading on July 19, and trading on the newly split shares will begin on July 20.

This [Motley Fool article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/08/shareholders-approve-nvidia-stock-split-heres-what/) has near identical wording.

That does actually read as if only those who owned shares on June 21 will have their shares split.  But I can't imagine that is right because people still can buy shares between 6/22 and 7/19.  And what, their shares are not going to get split?  That makes no sense.  

I think you are correct that anybody who owns shares on 7/19 will have 4x as many shares on 7/20 at 1/4 the price.  But yeah, the wording confusing.  Seems like the 6/21 date is irrelevant to me so kind of confused about what they were even trying to say there."

2021-06-23 16:33:02,stocks,"Thanks!  Your post inspired me to look up stock split ""record date"".  Found this explanation [here](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/stock-split/):

>Record date: This is an important date when it comes to accounting, but it isn't terribly important for investors to know. The record date is when existing shareholders need to own the stock in order to be eligible to receive new shares created by a stock split. However, if you buy or sell shares between the record date and the effective date, the right to the new shares transfers.   


So I guess it's kind of like they take a snapshot of all outstanding shares on 6/21 and those kind of get labeled ""split eligible""?  And I suppose the only time this might come into play would be the rare case where the company maybe issued some new shares between record date and actual split date and those wouldn't be eligible?  Anyway, cool.  Probably spent way to much energy trying to figure out what that date meant, but good to know!"
2021-06-23 14:49:28,stocks,This makes no sense to me. Let's say I had no NVDA shares as of 6/21. Then today I go out and buy 10 shares and hold them till 7/20. You're telling me I am not going to have 40 shares at the new price? How many shares will I have?
2021-06-23 14:37:51,stocks,"You said it yourself, you are thinking price goes up based on psychology not on what it actually does. Factually speaking a stock split is a nothing burger other than psychology.

Technically the right way to value a company is by how much money actually makes/can make. I have no doubt in my mind that NVDA is a fantastic company. That in no way means that it is worth the current value. 

The best way to really value a company is by imagining that you can never sell it. The only way you make money is if the company will generate enough earnings to send it to you via a dividend one day. As of right now NVDA would have to move mountains to one day dividend out enough cash to justify it's price. It could literally double for 3 years straight and then grow at 25% every year after and then you'd get your money back after 10 years. That would be insane growth and mean it basically wins the entire dedicated GPU market forever. 

If it grows at a more consistent 25% forever it will take 14 years.

Consider these figures are not even discounted at any interest rate. Everyone is investing as if rates will be <3% forever. They very well may be but is that a good way to base the success of your investment?

So yes, I think it is overpriced."

2021-06-23 14:47:45,stocks,"I would add one last thing. Lay people invest based on psychology mostly because they don't understand how to do a valuation. 
Analysts do a few different methods of valuation. Discount cash flows, dividend growth, price to sales, etc. At the end of the day there is no ""right"" way because yeah P/E means nothing if you know a company has a top notch product. You'll value it on growth/total addressable market/market share etc. However, analysts tend to give rosy pictures. A lot of it has worked because low rates mean debt to grow is cheap and high valuations mena the company can raise a ton of money from shareholders to fuel growth. 

With higher rates, debt payments slow down growth, lower valuation multiples, and that all tends to slow growth even if you have an amazing product. Uber/wework/Lyft/Tesla and and many others prob would have gone bankrupt if rates were at like 10% for the last decade."

I admit the language does read the way you have interpreted it but that just can't be the case.  The only way the value of my 10 shares would stay the same is if the split applied to them.  Because no matter what on the morning of 7/20 the value of each share is going to be 1/4 of what it was at closing the night before.  There aren't going to be 2 different share prices for NVDA, one pre-split and one post-split.  So either the split applies to me (and I now have 40 shares) or I just took a 75% loss.  I don't know what the 6/21 date means but it can't mean that."
2021-06-23 00:00:00,stocks,"$FIZZ looking tasty Let‚Äôs start with the basics: National Beverage Corporation is the Ft. Lauderdale, FL based parent company of a number of carbonated soft drink brands that you‚Äôve probably heard of and have likely tried in your lifetime, most notably: La Croix, Shasta, and Faygo.

What makes them a long term buy: They‚Äôre competitive among much bigger firms ($KO and $PEP) (think $AMD vs. $INTC). They‚Äôve been consistently increasing market share and profitability. They‚Äôre more vertically integrated than competitors: They own both the production and distribution facilities.

They‚Äôre actually profitable with a good long term track record (unlike a lot of other companies being hawked on here). They pay dividends (but not always regularly), and have decent P/E at 25.47 (which is better than KO and the industry average). While slightly less than average EPS at $1.83 is good, it‚Äôs better than KO, and they have had huge EPS growth at 42% in the last 12 months. FIZZ has a 16% profit margin while PEP is only 10%. Last but not least, they have almost no long term debt!

Technically FIZZ has been a steady gainer as well, with 82.7% 12-month price performance and 20% 6-month price performance. They had a 2:1 split at the end of February this year after paying out an enormous $6 per share! special dividend at the end of January.

Earnings is coming up (edit) 7 JUL. It‚Äôs expected to go down compared to last quarter, but a surprise beat might give the price a bump. Worth noting here that they‚Äôve beat earnings estimates on the last 5/6 periods.

Here‚Äôs a couple news articles recently published on FIZZ:

Also, LaCroix is under increasing pressure from white label and store brands, basically selling the exact same product. I've personally observed Kroger/Safeway fizzy products coming off the shelves faster than LaCroix products over the past 2 years.

They've essentially raised prices by selling in packs of 8, not 12. This puts them at price-parity with Pellegrino, Topo Chico and Perrier products, which actually sell real spring-fed mineral water, not carbonated municipal water.

Also, I'm bearish on Faygo, because old Insane Clown Posse fans are slowly dying of meth addiction and diabetes."

In terms of valuation they really arent cheaper than anyone else either. Check the fPE. 

* FIZZ 23.9
* KO 24.7
* PEP 23.7
* KDP 21.5

Generally speaking, DKP and PEP are likely to have the best growth moving forward. PEP for their diversification to snacks and KDP due to coffee strength. KO is probably going to show big gains this year due COVID previously hurting their restaurant rev/earnings. They also restructured a lot by divesting bottling in order to improve margins. Not sure how that will play out but their earnings dont seem to have been hurt.

ITUB is the largest private bank of Latin America. 

It also bought 49.9% of XP Investments which is the leading brokerage here and it's growing above 100% yearly, they say it's going to be the new Schwab.

When it comes to solidity, everyone knows that USA banks are involved in all kinds of fuckery, I would never let a penny into an USA account after I take profit of my investments. 

ITUB has over 300% of collateral needed for banks as per 2021. 

The financial system structure of Brazil, I can tell you my friend is the number 1 in the world and this happened because we suffered from hyper inflation a few decades ago and all the fears that you guys are afraid now. 

We suffered from scammers as well, that's why all the banks developed strong security systems. When I take a look at how ""secure"" are the USA banks it just makes me laugh, you guys adopted the 2nd factor not too long ago. 

Does that means we won't suffer from this anymore? Absolutely not, everything depends on what our government does, but it's unlikely. We don't have a FED printing money like it's nothing. About our Central Bank, by law it was declared independent to avoid political interference. 

When it comes about investing in Brazil, take note we are talking about 1 dollar for 5 real (our currency is called real). Everything is cheap to invest here aka lower valuations and that's what Buffet always take care. 

How deep do I know about financial market? Well, I'm a financial advisor here and I also set international investments for my clients. That's how I know how things work in USA, Europe and Asia.  


Now for the article, it's talking about Nubank. It's a financial start up that emerged to cheapen financial costs for their costumers, the thing is: They never profited since they born. But the startup environment is way different from a traditional company. Usually they burn cash to acquire market share and that's what Nubank is doing, they already have 35 million clients as per 2021/may. 

Buffet and other investors bet is that when it comes the time, Nubank can become profitable and then the valuation will explode even more. My only concern is: with 35 million people used to not pay any kind of account or credit card tax, how Nubank will begin to demand this? 

Regardless, most of Nubank clients are students and low income workers and don't get me wrong, but that's not exactly the clients you want to make a huge profit. But, there are rumors that they are planning an IPO and probably that's when Buffet will take the most advantage by selling his investment with an inflated valuation direct to the market.

Upstart‚Äôs AI model leverages over 1,000 variables and advanced machine learning algorithms to enable more accurate risk-based pricing and greater automation. With Upstart, bank and credit union partners can approve up to 3x the number of borrowers at the same loss rates as traditional FICO score-based models1 with near-zero default rates2. In addition, Upstart offers an all-digital lending experience to borrowers allowing them to apply from any device at any time with over 70%3 of funded loans being fully automated with no human interaction.

As a result of integration with NXTsoft‚Äôs APIs, financial institutions will now be able to more quickly integrate Upstart‚Äôs AI platform into their existing services. NXTsoft‚Äôs OmniConnect has established API connectivity to 99% of all U.S-based core systems and can provide API connectivity between these core systems and any ancillary fintech solution. NXTsoft has been in the API marketspace for over 25 years and has numerous partners and over 1,000 financial institutions that currently utilize its OmniConnect secure API solution to transmit data real-time between core systems and ancillary applications.

‚ÄúWe want to help our bank and credit union partners quickly and successfully deploy Upstart to lend to more creditworthy borrowers through a modern, all-digital experience,‚Äù said Michael Lock, senior vice president of lending partnerships for Upstart. ‚ÄúNXTsoft offers Upstart-powered banks and credit unions a proven approach to integrate our AI lending platform into their existing core systems and workflow to accelerate time to value and be in market with a new offering for their customers.‚Äù

Upstart was created to help solve the massive inefficiencies in the credit market. For thirty years, the industry has relied on credit scores and a handful of variables to make lending decisions, resulting in very inaccurate assessments of a borrower‚Äôs true credit worth. As a result, only 48%4 of consumers in the U.S. have access to prime credit even though 80% of them have never defaulted on a loan. This disparity is a direct result of the limited information available to financial institutions to make better credit assessments.

‚ÄúUpstart‚Äôs mission is to enable effortless credit based on true risk, and NXTsoft‚Äôs mission is to enable effortless connectivity between Fintech and financial institutions,‚Äù said David Brasfield, CEO of NXTsoft. ‚ÄúNXTsoft is excited to partner with Upstart to streamline and scale their ability to onboard new partners to their smarter, AI-based credit decisioning that facilitates a modern, all-digital lending experience.‚Äù"

2021-06-23 09:57:15,stocks,"The market has been rising for a generation.  However the high valuations are not because all those companies are going to grow exponentially, it's because during the last 2 market crashes (2008 and 2020) the FED has flooded the market with fake dollars. And our government has increased its spending or handing out of those fake dollars.   All the while interest rates have been rock bottom.   Yes the market is growing because there's no better place to grow our money.   A side thought I had,  with so much 401k and retirement money during that same time span,  it artificially inflates the market.   Basically it comes down to more dollars chasing the same limited resource (in this case stocks).

The FED knows they are in trouble.   Maybe Powell hopes to retire before the FED has to act or some international crisis will spook the markets,  so he doesn't have to take the blame for crashing the market. 
It's a ticking time bomb."

2021-06-23 09:18:57,stocks,"Putting in money at ATH is not risky in general. It depends how high it is and how much future earnings will be worth. Also on your time horizon.

If you only hold for a year, then it is really risky. If you hold for 50 years you will notice a drop but still make good money.

It is unlikely that the market as a whole will perform well over the next decade, a decline is likely or that inflation negates a majority of profits. Waiting for a crash could make sense if you know at which prices you will buy and even more if you have an alternative that will give you inflation protection.

In the end it also comes down to how long you would have to wait and how much of a drop it will be. If your time horizon is long enough, and the drop far enough (or your average buys during that time) it could make sense if a crash will happen in the next few years. If it doesn't, you will miss out on potentially massive gains."
2021-06-23 10:37:27,stocks,"You never know what PE level is supposed to be the right one, it constantly changes and is pretty much just an average.

Best case? Just do your research, get a great company, look into debt and profits, check what analysts think for the future (less as straight up fact but more as to what they write as a further understanding what you might have missed and then look into it how much of the claims are true), compare it to other companies in the same sector and then determine if you want to get in.

There is enough reason to believe that the market will go down in the next 2-4 years somewhere, but no one can actually tell. And with the amount of new money that covid moves into the markets for several reasons (tons of new investors, extra payment etc) it makes sense that things get overpriced. And if that money isn't lost (e.g. all quit at once) it will stay like that."

today i will be writing about alibaba stock ""BABA"" and exlplain my thesis regarding the underlying.

# intro:

Alibaba Group Holding Limited operates various segments including : core commerce, cloud, digital media, entertainment, payment services...

business which Alibaba group own: Taobao, TMALL, Freshipo, Lazada, Ali-express, Alibaba, ele,me, 1688, youku, alibaba-cloud, alimama, cainiao network, dingtalk, ant group, ali-pay

Alibaba group does business in almost every thing you can imagine, therfore you can compare them to every big tech you know, they stand with the big dogs.(AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT) but they get less attention at the moment.  i think the sentiment towards alibaba is bound to change, very soon.

**Why BABA ?, why now ?**

baba showed negative performance relative to the other tech stocks at the moment (market sentiment due to politics - alot of impact on the stock) . but baba strength can be seen in a few areas: revenue growth, solid financial position with reasonable debt and very reasonable and cheap valuation. the profit margins are lower when comparing to peers right now but baba business have much to grow and much to be expected to fix that issue.

Baba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before, but i think the next earning this year will reveal growth in EPS.

Now, lets start of with the basics and take a look on baba financial and valuation.

&#x200B;

# valuation:

[https://postimg.cc/5XqrBJKp](https://postimg.cc/5XqrBJKp)

so looking at valuations:

Mkrt value:  573B

p/e: \~25x

Fp/e: \~21x

p/s: \~5.2x

p/b: \~3.9x -> very attractive at this rate !

eps(ttm): 8.48

eps(ntm): \~12

next e/r : Aug 19

[https://postimg.cc/2b5gjtwG](https://postimg.cc/2b5gjtwG)

At BABA current stock price of $211, the market is expecting revenue to grow at 48.8% for the next 1 years. Over this period, BABA is also expected to generate an average Economic Earnings Margin of 13.8%

Baba have increased theirlong term debt looking at their financials but due to increase in future revenue i believe it is nothing to be bothered by. debt is not an real issue to baba.

\*\*very important note is that comparing baba to other big techs valuations at the moment proves that baba is dirty cheap and can be a good short/long term play . even is market goes sideways i dont see baba going any lower than right now. 200 price is pretty strong ressitence and still a good price.

revenue growth: 47.96%

eps growth : 14.42%

i will be including a look into baba Assets and Liabilities, which i believe is showing us a healthy company which keep growing and expanding and inceasing their cashflow, revenue and shareholders equity.

## Liabilities:

## Assets:

**Profitability:**

Profitability in baba business is quite larger comparing to peers.

# analyst reports:

most of the ANALysts recommend this stock. various price targets between 260\~350 price targets.

**and a few buying into: (including ark queen which i dont follow but nice to see)**

alot of big hedgies hold baba, you can check it out. (blackrock, goldman etc)

# Technicals:

52wk High: 319.32

52wk Low: 204.39

Avg volume (3M) : 15.8M -> breakout will increase volume obiously everybody watching the stock movement right now.

baba is down \~33% from the top at 319.32 (10/27/21).

I expect to see a bullish breakout in a couple days, can be happening anytime right now. good support at 209-210 level, every time we get there i can spot large money flowing into baba.

I believe that a price of 300$ before the year ends is possible and quite easy with a very little catalyst or sentiment change towards the company. right now from what im reviewing the sentiment towards baba is starting to chagne across the internet and financial market.

2021-06-23 09:06:50,stocks,"I‚Äôve run so many financial models on this company since last year throughout all the ups and downs and even now with a really conservative growth rate the FV I got is $270. I feel like this company is just too cheap to pass up. 

The only factor I‚Äôd see this company going downhill is if China decides to kill their largest company - which I doubt would happen, but who knows? I probably will continue to add into this position."
2021-06-23 08:38:54,stocks,"I think BABA looks a good price right now, but I think everyone factors in a certain risk % and applies it to the price and BABA has the China effect to take into account. 

Jimmy from ""Learn to invest"" seems to think the fair value is about $260, and he applies a 20% risk factor which brings his buy price to about $215.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx4Ypj5wOGU

It's a good video and a great channel where he does basic DD to get fair value of companies. Recommend watching it if you are going to invest in BABA just to get some over-view."
2021-06-23 09:30:22,stocks,Don‚Äôt know how you can have a DD on BABA without at least mentioning the geopolitical risk. China literally disappeared Jack Ma.
2021-06-23 11:24:51,stocks,"Chinese communist party is too unpredictable and does really stupid things to their marketplace. They are strangling their golden goose Hong Kong. As for Alibaba, is Jack Ma still alive? Figuratively, no, literally probably yes. But who knows. All the Chinese government cares about is staying firmly in total power - capitalist markets be damned. Since Xi assumed power, the Chinese marketplace has become severely more regulated. Alibaba looks like a good value, but I'd wait until the Chinese government does something tangible to show they still value capitalist markets. Wait and see is the best approach to BABA."
2021-06-23 12:45:08,stocks,"BABA is a good value play right now, but I like the growth story of PDD more at this time......"

2021-06-23 15:10:08,stocks,You forgot to mention the CCP.  They are a large risk to any Chinese company. BABA had so much potential and still does but is risky.
2021-06-23 16:13:07,stocks,"Ill buy as soon as China makes it legal...

\>> IT IS ILLEGAL FOR FOREIGNERS TO OWN CHINESE STOCK <<

The ADR's, like BABA, are not real stocks. You do not own any Alibaba stock when you buy them. They are literally a contract with a 3rd party in the Cayman islands outside of US and Chinese authority.

I would love to buy Alibaba or Tencent but I wont until China makes it legal. I strongly suggest avoiding Chinese ADR's for that reason. There are plenty of other countries who allow foreign ownership. Give them your money instead."

Ant financial from what ive read seem predatory with the their loans and china has been trying to cut down on consumer debt.  China charging baba a % of their revenue seemed like it validated the accuracy of their financials.  

More concern with trade wars and delisting.  

I have a position cost basis $240.   Will buy more if it goes below 200 i guess."
2021-06-23 11:56:35,stocks,"Remember that the CCP does not want anything bigger than itself. That is always a looming threat to any ""giant"" in China."
2021-06-23 16:51:45,stocks,"Watched it as well. The main takeaway I got from his video was that even after making his own changes to their 5 year outlook and adding a 20% risk premium (regulation & Chinese company), BABA was still trading below his own fair value which is why he was buyer at the $210 level.

Basically it‚Äôs so discounted around these levels that it‚Äôs hard to ignore the value and ROI it could return from a risk/reward perspective"
2021-06-23 08:42:17,stocks,"well i wrote some of my reasons in this DD and my thesis is strong regarding baba, imo. in the video you just sent he just used DCF to value to company, which is fair but not a must, but i hope it will give other people a good idea about baba stock :)"
2021-06-23 12:06:56,stocks,"Agree, this is not entirely a bear case, but case in point for a good DD to point out this key factor that drives why BABA is where they are today"
2021-06-23 12:37:03,stocks,"Geopolitical risk is already reflected in the discounted stock price.

AAPL and TSLA have similar geopolitical risk. If China wanted to choose the nuclear option, they could shut off the entire electronics supply chain to those outside of China, starting with rare earth metals. (China produces around 65% of the world's silicon)

Face it, despite the constant saber rattling by the US against China, the US economy is hopelessly dependent on China for its electronics supply chain. You can't undo 30 years of outsourcing in a couple years.

The US currently is completely devoid of manufacturing know-how."

2021-06-23 16:11:14,stocks,Tilray is a terrible company hahahaha. The best thing you can do is cut losses with them and move on. You heard about opportunity cost right?
2021-06-23 08:52:17,stocks,"I don't see how listening for 8 minutes to get another perspective is going to do you any harm but sure. 

It was more for other people reading the thread so they have another source to support your DD, so they can decide if they want to invest or not. Reddit is currently infested with pump DDs which have nothing but positive cases and no bear case, trying to get everyone to buy some junk so they can sell their bags or profit off people. Not saying yours is, but there's a lot of it around right now. 

I do have a position in BABA at $211 and do intend to buy more though, I think you're right that it has room to grow again, but slightly less optimistic on price estimates."

2021-06-23 16:41:12,stocks,"I know right?

Which makes it even more scary how BABA's stock fell from $300 on October has hasn't recovered since. Even though Jack Ma isn't as involved in BABA as a company anymore.

If Bill Gates or Larry Page was arrested in the U.S., I would expect Microsoft or Google shares to take a dip, but I wouldnt expect them to keep falling 20% and stay there for about eight months. The company should be more than its ex-CEOs/Founders."

2021-06-23 14:09:39,stocks,DD doesn‚Äôt mean you just state one side of the coin. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm pointing out here. You say it‚Äôs undervalued. There‚Äôs a reason for that and you ignore it here.
2021-06-23 10:35:03,stocks,"I like how you handle the negativity sir. I‚Äôve been looking to get into BABA for a few weeks now, just gotta find money to put in"
2021-06-23 08:54:51,stocks,"i thought you wrote something else actually, edited my comment and watched it lol. you can read my comment now again."
2021-06-23 12:44:51,stocks,A bit different from 'kidnapping' one of the execs.
2021-06-23 12:58:55,stocks,"Which is why Apple is starting to shift to India.

But let‚Äôs get real- China won‚Äôt be able to disappear Musk or shut down any future IPOs Cook has planned.

The CCP‚Äôs interference should make every investor terrified to invest in Chinese stocks."
2021-06-23 14:21:56,stocks,"are you serious ? its not that im ignoring it, its not that im not aware of the elephant in the room. i am aware, i know the price stock at this moment represnts everything. from the US china relations to the ant not ipo and cut in value to jack ma and everything after.

if you would have read the actually DD you could understand my point, those old ""reasons"" that im aware of are not relvant anymore IMO, the company makes alot of money, they stand off with every over tech giant in the US. the valuation is very very cheap and therfore i anticipate with regarding to MANY reasons that the stock is due to bullish breakout, including the technical reasons with the fundamentals with change of sentiment towards baba and china.

but its ok, i only shared my information to open some eyes and let people be aware of great opportunity to make money."
2021-06-23 10:41:58,stocks,"if i wasnt certain about my thesis i wouldnt have posted this ""DD"". this post wont make me money. its not a meme low float high short kinda stock. my only intention was to spread the knowledge regarding a good trade. but blind people cannot be helped, and thats fine ."
2021-06-23 13:26:16,stocks,"The US would be a better place if it clamped down on fraud, corruption and grift like the Chinese government does.

China executes more people for fraud and corruption than any other country.

In the US, you have criminals like Bernie Madoff and Jeff Skilling operating scams for more than a decade, and hedge funds inside trading stocks like it's afternoon tea."
2021-06-23 13:10:53,stocks,"Shifting assembly to India won't do shit when your entire supply chain is disrupted.

You can't do anything if you can't even get silicon or batteries.

The US is just as likely to shit the fan as China is. That's why if you're smart you hedge your bets and invest in both. And then when the US finally gets its act together and decides that working together is the best approach going forward, as it has been over the past 20 years, you're in a win-win situation.

The past 20 years has been hugely deflationary for consumers, which is good because prices on technologies remains low, and the deflationary environment allows for a lower benchmark interest rate without fear of inflation. This in part, has occurred because of our cooperation with China.

Bringing back or on-shoring key technologies will be an expensive as hell endeavor, so if we decide to continue this ""cold war' with China and go at it ourselves, expect massive inflation to occur, and a whole class of people without the right skills in manufacturing or hardware supply chain to remain unemployed and unable to afford the rising cost of goods."
2021-06-23 10:45:29,stocks,Well thanks for taking the time out of your day üëçüèº
2021-06-23 16:14:03,stocks,"Sir don‚Äôt call us blind. Financially speaking, yes they must be in a great position but this is China we‚Äôre talking about. That‚Äôs where the risk comes in for me personally. I don‚Äôt think the risk is worth investing in this company. The CCP obviously had a problem with Jack Ma‚Äôs success and being so outspoken. The fact that he disappeared isn‚Äôt concerning to you?! I hope you make money as in everyone on this sub but calling people blind for not seeing your side of this is a bit immature."
2021-06-23 13:59:20,stocks,Wow. What the fuck.
2021-06-23 16:25:48,stocks,"got any reason for people hanging to those old reasons which upon they state their ""bear"" cases ? idc about jack ma, the ccp will be fine. what do you think china will do ? ban all relations with the us ? the us need china and china need the us. things gonna sort out either way. both countries will only thrive financialy when working together. and they know it."
2021-06-23 14:04:39,stocks,Found Jeff Skilling's alt
2021-06-23 15:07:54,stocks,That is what I said.
2021-06-23 16:31:07,stocks,"I agree with you on that statement, I think the bigger concern is that BABA‚Äôs growth now has a limit and they‚Äôre ability to keep up with competition or have a market cap like an AMZN is now being thrown out the window due to the CCP and how they control their businesses. In the USA we don‚Äôt seem to have that issue yet. The monopolies continue to grow in size and power. I‚Äôm not disregarding your DD, just think that the CCP is a big reason the bears exist for this particular stock."
2021-06-23 14:15:23,stocks,[removed]
2021-06-23 16:34:33,stocks,"yeah i understand your points. but i strongly believe that baba will keep growing bigger, they are much larger business than people understand. they are alot more than a monopol and thats why the ccp keep an eye on them. yet imo baba will stay on course, and the stock will shoot higher as the sentiment towards baba and china become better."
2021-06-23 16:41:41,stocks,I hope you are right and make a bunch of money off of your research! I put them on my watchlist and appreciate your DD and info posted. I always like to learn about new stocks and get exposure to info like this üëçüèΩI can‚Äôt speak for all bears but hopefully my input was somewhat helpful to why this stock is potentially undervalued.
2021-06-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Array (ARRY) settlement? Owned ARRY back in 2016-17, sold it, forgot about it. Got a letter in the mail the other day saying some settlement had been agreed upon and I was entitled to some small sum of money based on my having owned it during that time. 

If it was the usual ambulance chasing I wouldn't think twice about it, but apparently this is a real settlement already agreed upon and all one as to do is sign up and get a check. Surprising all around because I was buying a lot of overhyped biotechs during that time and this one was one of the few on which I actually made money lol. But apparently something went ""arry"" and lawyers were called in.

Anyways, just wondering if anyone else received this notice, if it's worth it to pursue, etc."

Get it? *Busting* out.

No mainstream apparel brand is as on-point right now with Gen Z/Alpha vibes as American Eagle/Aerie.

Website/e-commerce site review:

The Gap/Old Navy e-commerce sites are incomprehensible and a mess. GAP looks like its using mid 00's style model pictures. Old Navy looks like a dollar store.

A&F doesn't let you browse their website with a VPN which a fail already. Secondly, they use the old style modeling pics that looks late 00s, early 10s. They're really leaning into the super-curvy model types, which is great for virtue signaling and ESG/social style investing, but from a subconscious marketing perspective, really gets away from what is ""aspirational"". Beware of this. I worked for a hedge fund in the mid 2010's that made a fortune shorting Michael Kors and Coach, because these brands too, lost their ""aspirational vibes"".

Victoria's Secret has pivoted away from SUPER SEXY into EVERYDAY COMFORT, but most of their marketing still pushes the bedroom rather than the beach vibe of Aerie.

I'm still on board with the thesis that **Aerie will overtake Victoria's Secret in market share in the women's underwear market in 5-7 years, assuming a growth rate between 12-80% per year, year over year decay, and increase in Victoria growth rate of 0-10%**"

They will subsequently outperform as credit spreads tighten when the economy bottoms out and recovery starts. Investment grade corporate bond returns, on the other hand, are more sensitive to interest rates than credit, so as interest rates fall during a recession, they will outperform vs equity, but will underperform vs government bonds which have the highest interest rate sensitivity. So to answer your question, investment grade corporate bonds are an OK recession hedge, high yield corporate bonds are not a recession hedge, and government bonds are the best recession hedge (especially long duration government bonds)."

2021-06-23 11:11:40,stocks,"So I'm definitely biased because I love Peloton as a user, and just became a (albeit tiny) investor. I think there is a ton of potential- their corporate wellness program can help them reach big companies that will buy pelotons for their gyms (at discounted rates and memberships for user), I agree with the other poster who said gyms themselves may start buying Pelotons. I know hotels and Air BnBs have already started doing this as travelers want to be able to have access to their Peloton stuff while away. Peloton has also gamified working out with badges, challenges, etc. as ways to keep people motivated. Not to mention- they have a HUGE variety of classes, and so much growth potential to other venues (boxing, rowing, and a mirror type thing have been rumored), as well as expansion into more countries. Obviously there have been missteps- but the potential is there. There are also rumors about expanding into their own wearables, as it's a pain right now to get Fitbit/Apple watches/ or other heartrate monitors to sync to their devices. They recently upgraded their heart rate monitoring aspect (Strive Score) and I think this COULD also allude to a branch out into wearables (although that's prob more of a conspiracy theory at this point, lol).

Personally, I think that the at-home gym is going to pick up, not slow down, post-COVID as people have realized and appreciate the convenience and affordability of it. This is totally all just my opinion, but as a Peloton user I can 100% see the potential.

This is also an OTC Pink, which generally is ""riskier"" than some OTC's from the brokerage perspective.  You'll usually get a warning that ""appropriate shares quantities may not be available"" with OTC Pink.  If you're placing an AON order, it can get even more complicated.

Some platforms basically won't let you trade anything on the OTC Pink market unless you're pre-approved or have ""X"" in your account fully settled.  Really depends on the platform."

Though I'd advise that you ask yourself whether the money you're thinking about investing is an amount that you mind losing if the stock suddenly dips. If it is, I'd not bet on GS. 

If you're looking to turn a quick profit, probably not a good idea to bet on GS (or almost any stock). 

If you're making the decision to buy based on hivemindspeak and not from information about the company you've read on your own, probably not a good idea.

If you, a novice, have a couple hundred, better to invest in something that is more stable, like an ETF for example. There's plenty of information here to get you started. It's not as thrilling as some of the stocks you may have heard about, but having stability supports your portfolio's balance so that if you do invest in something that's a fad, it won't hurt you as much if it dips.

Even on the bike there are many different instructors with different personalities and classes are also different. You can do 15min HIIT or 90min Power zone.   I pick my rides based on my mood.  They also do artist features so you can do a Lizzo ride or Beatles ride, for example. I would actually get more bored at the gym. 

And in terms of community/social aspect - there are very vibrant and active communities on Instagram and Facebook. I actually have Facebook friends now whom I met on some of those pages. And we plan rides together and share which strength classes we liked. I have never connected this much to anyone at the gym before. 

It really is a lifestyle change and I find it beneficial from any aspect: financial, variety, community, and most importantly - saving time.

What are some ideas or is this even a good idea? Noob obviously.
2021-06-23 06:07:15,stocks,Buy dividend paying stocks
2021-06-23 08:29:03,stocks,"There's a few types of dividend investing, I'll focus on 2 that might be good for you:

Dividend growth investing:

This strategy ignores higher yield for a higher rate of growth. Companies that have double digit dividend growth plus a strong company/moat like LMT are ideal on these cases. This is a long term strategy where your initial investment grows its output. For investors with a longer time horizon it's a good idea.

Income investing:

This strategy chases a higher yield in exchange for less growth. Covered call ETFs and high yield stocks are normally the target here, though the same aim of getting into a strong company or smartly managed fund applies here. This is a shorter term strategy that lets you live off your dividends now, so it's better for those with a shorter time horizon.

I personally just have some of each, though I'm more focused on growth than income."
2021-06-23 05:22:50,stocks,"I‚Äôd suggest just sticking a large chunk in S&P 500 index funds. Offers steady growth and a small yield paid quarterly

2021-06-23 01:41:25,stocks,"I know this is going to be an anticlimactic answer, but if I did really well in a meme stock ($CLOV), I would go to something that I would consider boring, such as BRK.B to keep my financial future rolling! Pass those puppies to loved ones upon my death in the form of a trust, and revel in the legacy I have built for myself. Best wishes!

Edit: If you're young, this is what I would *personally* do. This is my own stance and would suggest you do whatever best meets your goals and needs."

Both broad based index funds focusing on value companies. I‚Äôm partial to DGRO as it‚Äôs focusing on companies that are growing their dividend but VONV will get you a higher current yield even if the growth isn‚Äôt as good."
2021-06-23 07:27:01,stocks,Pick a few strong companies that pay dividends.  Simple as that really. Considering the enevitable inflation and increase in interest rates. Banks and insurers could be a smart place to park your winnings.
2021-06-23 11:54:32,stocks,"Obviously, buy dividend paying stocks. But they're not all created equal. IMHO:

- your safest bet is a dividend fund or ETF like SCHD or HDV. these are higher-paying dividend stocks, from larger established blue-chip companies. you can get a 3-4% dividend. these stocks won't shoot up like meme stocks, but they will have modest capital appreciation over time. SCHD: https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/insights/resource/schd-fact-sheet or HDV: https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/hdv-ishares-core-high-dividend-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf

- next safest bet is single stocks from these types of American companies. look up ""dividend aristocrats"", companies that have never lowered or missed a dividend for decades or even centuries. the sweet spot seems to be stocks with high *yield* but low *payout ratio*. this means the dividend is larger relative to share price, but they pay out a lower percentage of profits, because they still devote a lot of money to expansion or research/development. aristocrats: https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/dividend-stocks-aristocrats high yield/low dividend, see page 13: http://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/high-dividends-research-by-tweedy-browne.pdf

- US REITs are also pretty safe (but not foolproof, as the Covid lockdown proved). these are real estate investment trusts, rental properties of some type or another that pay out a lot of their income to investors. VQN pays about 2%. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VNQ

- next safest best is dividend stocks/ETFs from larger foreign blue chip companies in developed markets. IDV is an example for an ETF. Japan, Western Europe and UK commonwealth nations are relatively stable and will often pay a bit more than US stocks. Rio Tinto mining pays 4-5% https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIO and Legal & General, a large old UK insurance company, pays 5-6% dividend. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LGGNY?p=LGGNY&.tsrc=fin-srch

- next best is something like DIV, which is very high yield US stocks in the 5% range. these are from smaller companies, or distressed companies that have raised their dividend to attract investors. this pays higher dividend than SCHD, but the companies are often lower quality and the share price is more likely to flatline for years. https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/div/

- last option is emerging markets dividends. this is the highest dividends but also highest risk, due to currency fluctuations and political risks. look at something like SDIV or DYYE. for an example, Sperbank from Russia pays a very high dividend, presently 5/6% but historically up to 8-10%. the risk is it's a Russian state-owned enterprise. ditto for China or Turkey.

2021-06-23 00:47:23,stocks,"Container shipping. Liners and ship lease companies. 

Liners for short term capitalization on shipping rate increases. I am long $ZIM. They should earn over $20 a share, $2 special dividend coming soon, (I think Aug but would have to check) then they plan on return 30-50% of 2021 earning back to holders at beginning of 2022.

Ship lease companies, $ATCO, $DAC, $NMM.

ATCO, they specialize in longterm leases with numerous of the largest size. In order to see large returns they need the lease rate to stay high because of their long contracts plus size of company. They are considered like a blue chip of their industry.

$DAC they are printing cash, ok dividend could be better but last earnings call they said don't expect much of a hike. They are paying down debt, and saving for???? Not sure, they made waves when they said building war chest. But they are signing 3 and 4 year contracts, based on current contracts they could finish out contract scrap ships, close shop and you would have enough value for mid 70's in cash. 

$NMM - Hybrid containership leasor, drybulk. If they keep signing containership lease agreements like they have been, 3-4 year making tons of cash, you will be getting the drybulk portion for free. Which drybulk rates are right near 10 year highs. Big risk factor here is the Corp governance. The ceo owns a bunch of sister companies and has made some great moves but some that make you scratch your head. Current 1 being, she is issuing new units (partnership, so do your DD) at about half last reported NAV.

I am long all above stocks. Do your DD, and it takes time to figure out different sectors in Shipping. Not all are tankers!!!"
2021-06-22 23:59:21,stocks,"Streaming. SVOD/AVOD services are still a minority in the TV market and has massive room to grow. Most ad budgets are still overwhelmingly assigned to traditional TV as well. All of it is projected to flip-flop over the next decade and we will reach a point where nearly everything will be streamed. 

The trend towards remote and stay-at-home work is here to stay and streaming demand will remain elevated along with 5g, satellite and broadband expanding the potential market.

Stocks like Roku, TTD, DIS, VIAC all stand to benefit immensely. I see Roku with the most potential as they begin to monetize their subscribers and expand internationally. VIAC is incredibly undervalued with their biggest risk - debt - being inflated/QE'ed away. I see them as a longer term play with a lot of value coming 2022 and beyond. In the worst case, they become an attractive acquisition target."

2021-06-23 09:27:49,stocks,"Oil and gas:

RDS.A: theyre still priced as an oil and gas stock but I think they're the most likely to shift successfully into renewables. BP is a somewhat distant second in this category

CVX: i think Chevron is the best positioned major to continue to pump out dividends. Well run. 

I don't believe in any of the refiners. Most of the best refineries are owned by majors, and the ones that aren't are gonna have huge drag on them by the other portfolio refineries of the refining company.

Midstream: Kinder Morgan is still the go to here. 

For the long term, I'm not bullish on any of the smaller players. Too much risk: management risk, commodity price risk, no economies of scale, political risk. With the way governments and companies are shifting towards EVs, when oil demand peaks and starts to decline, smaller E&Ps will be the ones who die quickly."

For Technology, I think it is sort of a fools errand to identify a name that matters. Instead, I buy BFOCX to get most of the best companies in the field. Anytime there is a tech name I hear about and I get interested in, I discover it is already in BFOCX and go back to not caring. I am bullish on the industry itself and advise diversifying to the point where no name matters more than any other.

For Entertainment, Disney. Granted, I am in at $90/share, but still, would not be surprised to see Disney hit 5x its current valuation within a few years and end up with a ten-bagger.

Infrastructure, CLF. I really like it when a stock is in the Warren Buffet ""Yes"" pile. This is not too hard. Steel is needed. Steel is in short supply. This company is positioned to provide it advantageously.

The degree leverage is much lower and their assets are far less risky, plus they have passed all of the FEDs stress tests, and now with rates at rock bottom across the globe to me it seems like a great time to buy banks both ,  US and global my favorite are Citi and HSBC because they both have a large global presence particularly in Asia and I also like Goldman and Morgan Stanley on the investment banking side because those two definitelyhave the most stellar risk management in the business, in 08 both firms managed to remain the two last US independentinvestment banks and more recently made it out of the Archegos debacle with minor to no losses. As for private equity they have preformed great this past decade, however as rates rise the private equity firms main LBO strategy will suffer and they will have to change their strategy and hedge intrest rate risk, in this sector Blackstone is clearly the best bet mainly because they invested the most in the cheap period from 2009 to 2014 and this sets them up for the best future returns but they also are still lead by the founder and have the best reputation on the street, however KKR and Apollo as well as Carlyle are also great firms which undoubtedly will do well."

2021-06-23 03:45:09,stocks,"NOK has been selling off slightly in the past few weeks and is IMHO trading at a discount considering they are targeting an unique market with their latest Ligado partnership news bringing 5G networks into the L-band. The 1.6GHz spectrum licence Ligado has have been speculative for a while but now that they have permission from FCC and 3GPP they are in a great spot to roll out ultra-reliable 5G solutions in the low mid-range freq.

Other 5G network providers did not go for the lower frequency licences because they didn't think it would be allowed yet, probably, with a lot of companies making a statement against Ligado's proposed use of the L-band and it's implications for GPS interference, but it's only a matter of time when they'll want to offer private networks with L-band capabilities because the propagation characteristics between the more widely used C-band and L-band are quite huge. The networks will be useful to support the C-band in both long-distance settings and urban settings with building penetration needs.

Honestly, with the money being thrown at Ligado to make the L-band 5G happen, I think Nokia will benefit from this partnership a lot."

I'm also bullish on online fast fashion companies Shein and ASOS. Mainly because I see them as takeover or partnership targets by Amazon or Alibaba.

The two companies have completely undercut the pricing of fast fashion competitors H&M, F21, Mango and to a certain extent Zara. And when your market is disposable fashion, price really really matters. They've done this through superior online execution and JIT C2M manufacturing that's even faster than Zara, the previous gold-standard bearer in speed."

Very bullish on Capcom even though the stock isn't doing too well right now. They're pretty much the only publisher bringing their A game this year.

1) Some of their executives get paid an *insane* amount. Granted they typically are an R&D focused company, but their head of R&D's pay package was just short of $135 millon for 2020 alone! CEO received something similar if not a bit more.

2) By far far far their best seller is Eylea, and its patent protection is running out soon, and you best believe there are other companies waiting in the wings. Regeneron got a bit fortunate in the last year or so that a similar product newly launched by Novartis hit a speed bump a few months after launch.

2021-06-23 04:40:02,stocks,"Counter point: most of the civilized world doesn't trust the nuclear power industry because they're as dishonest as Big Tobacco.  The large pile of accidents has made people realize nuclear can't honestly be called ""safe"" and the fact they've still haven't solve the toxic waste problem, so they're lying when they say ""clean"" too.  There's moratoriums on new nuclear sites and they're accelerating the decommission of old ones.

Most significantly is that while nuclear has does nothing for the last 20 years (except destroy a quadrant of Japan and leak poison into the world's oceans) renewable energy has made incredible advancements.  Sun and wind and water and thermal energy are finally viable, and getting better every day. People have realized that nuclear (with its legacy of broken promises and lies) is no longer the only alternative.  It's now the least desirable of the non-carbon sources.

Reddit is heavily laced with nuclear industry astroturfers, so you can expect them to post the same tired and misleading talking points here.  They're boosted by kids who just took junior high school physics and think they just discovered the atom, so then eagerly repeat and embellish as much fishing line as the astroturfers give them.

2021-06-23 08:46:21,stocks,"The global weed industry projection is <$50b. Do the math on how much these weed companies should be worth. Check their graphs, besides pumping and dumping, weed stocks kill portfolios. I think weed will be a very hard investment because, contrary to what people believe, weed is going to be less valuable and MORE competitive when it's legalized fully in the US. That means less money for companies. 

If you wanna ride it out for the next pump and dump, that's not a bad thesis. But to say weed is a $100b industry is flat out wrong. At one point aphria and tilray (Canadian companies) were valued as much if not more than the entire current weed industry. Their valuations are still a bit ahead.

I expect the big winners in the weed space to be constellation brands and altria, since they are large cap stocks that own positions in canopy and cronos respectively. They have the cash and ability to buy out these smaller companies and compete on a large scale. Tilray is okay, but they have no american exposure, I believe. And the entire Canadian marijuana industry is valued at $4b. I believe the numbers I cited are relavent for 2019, so maybe a bit outdated, but relatively accurate."

And since you raised credit quality they have the lowest default rate and highest average credit score of any major origination company.  They's a stealth fintech, containing within their structure an equivalent of Docusign, an equivalent of Lemonade, and others.  Their tech clever a offloads the work to non-salaries outsides, leaving their own staff to focus on closings and getting all the details perfect for a closure time about twice as quick as industry.

I looked into data for accuracy of diagnosis and much of it shows that numbers vary between platforms but I didn't come across numbers specifically for teledoc that were recent. More generally here's a study from an ER that implemented Telehealth: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30209006/

Essentially found no significant difference  in terms of accuracy between in-person vs Telehealth using cancelation of orders for diagnostic tests as the primary outcome. But this is just one study in one hospital. Certain diseases are much harder to diagnose via Telehealth but the industry is still in its infancy. Short term the opportunity in chronic care management is what excites me. Longer term new innovations will likely need to occur for it to become mainstream"
2021-06-23 09:52:55,stocks,Great points! The executive compensation was concerning to me as well. And in regards to Eyelea there are many pharma companies I have come across with the same risk. I mentioned one in $ABBV with their expiring Humira patent. Essentially I view $REGN as underpriced for the short term (1 - 3 years) but would not plan to hold past that barring changes in product sales. I'm more short term bullish due to their REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. The FDA recently approved a lower dose and I see significant opportunity in emerging markets.

But a similar company was just bought buy liner at a nice premium, so that means the box shortage might last for awhile. I will definitely keep an eye on TRTN because I like the company.  But with all of these shipping names, I move in and out more then I do for long buy and hold names. They are sticks you have to keep an eye on because economics for them change fast."

Also on finviz it shows negative revenue.  I didn't know a company could have negative revenue.  Earnings yes.  What's up with that?

https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=ind_softwareinfrastructure&o=-ps

I own LMND, PATH, STEM, and used to own CRWD and NET. These command high valuations not so much because of hype but because they have actually been growing like mad, both revenues and into new and yet to even emerge sectors. And sure, hype, too. I sold CRWD and NET in April/May thinking they'd be the first to collapse in the event of a market meltdown, but they're tech leaders that are leading the way back in growth stocks.

Still, are they ""fairly valued""? I don't know. I own a lot of value growth stocks, too, that I really like by PE and conventional measures: ONEW, THO, CCS, INMD, PUBM, PERI. Check out the IBD 50. Also just plain old value stocks like JOAN.

i will just say that with growth stocks, quality of leadership is critical. one major reason i got into net and crwd is due to the caliber of the respective founders. insanely talented, ambitious, and visionary leadership.

I do question their valuation right now but by the same token, I've seen a few estimates of them hitting $295 by end of the year.  There is a lot of enthusiasm around CRWD and cybersecurity is a hot space with everything that's happening in US right now.

Also want to mention that all my stocks are for long term so not selling anything for at least five years and possibly longer. Which one would you pick and why? Thank you.
2021-06-22 20:21:23,stocks,"Between the two, I would pick Starbucks. I think coffee and the coffeehouse experience has more of a shelf life than fast food. Over time I think it will take more work for McDonald‚Äôs to maintain its market share and grow in new markets. And the costs of doing so will be significant. Starbucks I think has an easier and more globally appealing roll out model"
2021-06-23 02:52:04,stocks,"I personally don‚Äôt like either one but I‚Äôd go McD‚Äôs if only because they have a buttload of cash + global brand recognition. It seems like you‚Äôre looking for a safe long term pick based off your post. Personally, I‚Äôd pick KO. The Coca Cola Company owns over 200 different brands, and their products are sold in over 200 countries/territories and has a 3% dividend. There‚Äôs not a lot of growth since it‚Äôs a mature company, and due to the pandemic (restaurants being shut down) there‚Äôs been a decline in sales which has affected its financial statements in a negative way, but I don‚Äôt see the demand for their products to ever going away. There‚Äôs also MCO, Moody‚Äôs Corporation which is a credit rating company. Admittedly, idk much about it, but it has 40% market share in that area and Warren Buffet seems to believe in it enough to have held it for 20 years. Not only that, but it‚Äôs up over 200% in the last five years, and it grew 18% during the pandemic. This isn‚Äôt at all financial advice, just my opinions; definitely do your due diligence and good luck investing!"
2021-06-22 21:08:46,stocks,Personally I prefer McDonald‚Äôs. 26% profit margin vs Starbucks 4%. Plus I like their food and brand more.
2021-06-22 23:32:30,stocks,I like Starbucks. I also own Starbucks so I am being a shameless shill.
2021-06-22 20:31:00,stocks,"If we're picking between the two, MCD is ultra defensive, with truckloads of cash, and an unparalleled ability to increase dividend. Buy today, and it may seem like the dividend at 3% is mediocre, but they've shown the ability to and dedication to consistently increase it. SBUX isn't a bad company, but if you're heavy in growth, you should want a super stable option, and there's very few options in any sector more stable than MCD."
2021-06-22 20:48:02,stocks,"I think this depends on your long term outlook for the economy and your current portfolio.  If you need more defensive diversity then MCD.  MCD is more recession proof.  People will buy cheap fast food during all times.  Maybe more so during down turns.  Expensive coffee, not so much."

2021-06-22 23:01:05,stocks,"Mcd over Starbucks. MCD has McCafe, so they will have a share of the coffee market with the diversification of other products."
2021-06-23 09:35:39,stocks,"Starbucks has been having some serious supply issues (many employees have made videos on tik tok about how they are running out of basically everything, even cups, and are having to go to grocery stores to pick up supplies for their location). I see it dipping more in the near future and have even considered getting some puts. If you do choose Starbucks I‚Äôd just hold off for a better entry."
2021-06-23 03:20:36,stocks,"Have you considered adding a reit, like O?
Since both SBUX & MCD are involved with real estate too."
2021-06-23 05:44:03,stocks,doesn't Starbucks have a lot of cash on hand from their gift cards? Starbucks probably but don't know anything really.
2021-06-22 20:23:52,stocks,"HUIZ. 1/30th the price of LMND on a P/S basis, with quadruple the growth, and none of the underwriting risk. I wrote a DD on SeekingAlpha about it"
2021-06-22 20:38:41,stocks,Why are you picking stocks? It doesn't seem you truly understand what you're doing. I would suggest a vanguard total market etf like VT or VTI
2021-06-22 20:39:03,stocks,Thanks for the opinion.
2021-06-23 00:59:46,stocks,"i notice that the fast food companies just copy each other on what's hot i dont think fast food is going anywhere as thats like saying were going to stop smoking or drinking. mcdonalds can add or change its menu.  i wish they would bring the salads back

i mean look at pizza and how saturated that is yet its still awesome, every month i see a new pizza company. todds pizza, alexs pizza, blaze pizza.. mod pizza,"
2021-06-23 05:35:30,stocks,"Great, thank you."
2021-06-22 20:38:11,stocks,So you would pick McDonald‚Äôs for sure?
2021-06-23 17:49:34,stocks,"For now, i can do only one. Once i reach my target of this one, then ill start saving for the other position.  Both are on my list. Wasnt sure which one to start first. 
Decision was made and cash invested in McDonald‚Äôs today. Thanks everyone for the feedback.Starbucks to follow next in the future."

Find a better thread to advertise it lol"
2021-06-22 20:40:02,stocks,Hm... not very bullish on chinese stocks... yet. But i appreciate the suggestion.
2021-06-22 20:41:21,stocks,"Where are you getting this idea that i dont understand what i am doing?
Glad to hear you are an expert. Hope you are a billionaire by now."
2021-06-22 20:42:13,stocks,"Personally, yes, but with the caveat that I personally come into this discussion with the premise that if I'm going hard on growth, I need to balance my risk profile. Starbucks could very well have a higher return, but the point is risk adjusted return. SBUX could also return negative yields, or less positive. MCD will never ""moon,"" but it will steady churn out returns, especially over a 20 year outlook.

Tl;dr, yes I would for sure pick MCD, but I would not be surprised if SBUX outperformed."
2021-06-23 04:29:19,stocks,"200% Rev growth & a P/s of 1 is speculation?

Ok"
2021-06-22 20:50:46,stocks,Yet?  The goal is to be bullish... first

2021-06-22 20:51:52,stocks,"Lol... we all do our own research and sometimes we get stuck on what to choose. 
I like both stocks so at this point just want to hear what other people think of either. I only want to invest in one."
2021-06-23 00:00:00,stocks,"MSFT for long term Microsoft hit a $2 trillion market cap. I know the idea of a company being worth $2.5 or $3 trillion is kind of insane, but Microsoft continues to return major increases in revenue/profits annually; plus they control so much in the cloud space.

Is there really a reason to believe that Microsoft would be a bad buy at this point?

(Note: I already have MSFT shares, just curious if it is worth sticking with a buying pattern)"
2021-06-22 20:15:36,stocks,Im super long in MSFT. Theres litterally no chance I will sell in the next 20 years. Buy it and hold it
2021-06-22 20:28:42,stocks,"I‚Äôve said this many times and I‚Äôll say it again: I really like Microsoft.  They are heavily betting on cloud with Azure. They‚Äôve had huge growth through it and have managed to take market share from AWS. Xbox is about to be more than just consoles, it‚Äôll be more about the gamepass and other services. The Office 365 and Windows are super popular products for businesses and everybody uses them. Probably one of the strongest moats in the world. LinkedIn is also a very interesting one since it is a platform with so many possibilities. 

Financials are great. Everything is going up smoothly revenue and net income wise. Margins are also nice. The balance sheet is true grit with the well controlled debt and huge pile of cash. And Satya Nadella isn‚Äôt afraid to use it. He‚Äôs a great CEO and will lead the company beyond that 2 trillion dollar market cap. They‚Äôve had their differences with the US government in the past, so I think Microsoft won‚Äôt face as much preassure from Capitol Hill as the other big tech companies."
2021-06-22 20:54:45,stocks,All I know is I've been told to never sell MSFT or AAPL.  20% of my portfolio and have been solid.
2021-06-22 21:23:52,stocks,"From 2001 to 2010 investors didn't think it was a 'good buy'. Hind sight - they we're wrong. 

As long as the market is strong MSFT stock price will be strong. When the market struggles MSFT will linger. The Covid crash of 2020 proved that. They have a AAA credit rating and revenues growing at supersonic speeds and a boatload of cash. As long as you don't panic sell during a weak market MSFT is a great place to invest."
2021-06-22 21:42:06,stocks,"Try not to think about the market cap number in isolation. In the past a billion, 10 billion and 100 billion dollar company was crazy. Now all are common place. Think more about earnings, earnings growth and PE multiples. In my lifetime a company will likely be worth 100 trillion"
2021-06-23 02:31:13,stocks,Been DCAing MSFT for the last four months!
2021-06-22 20:14:20,stocks,it should be part of the FAANG stocks imo.  Easy buy
2021-06-23 04:23:22,stocks,I like what they are doing with gamepass.
2021-06-22 22:50:25,stocks,"As long as Nadella is at the helm, I'm extremely bullish"
2021-06-22 22:24:09,stocks,"If cash is trash , then MSFT is KING üëë !"
2021-06-22 20:43:49,stocks,"Is MSFT a great company? Absolutely

Is their stock a good buy today at it's valuation? That depends on your assumptions

Is google good at $100/share? How about $1M per share?

Valuation is important"
2021-06-23 07:40:56,stocks,"In 100 years, a market cap of 2 trillion will be considered mediocre for a company."
2021-06-22 21:17:24,stocks,I love how interested this sub becomes in a company after their stock price goes up.
2021-06-23 05:39:46,stocks,"Asking here again but there is a triple leveraged MSFT on London stock exchange. Some have claimed it can be purchased on USA exchanges but I haven‚Äôt been able to find the ticker.

If anyone knows please post here"
2021-06-23 02:19:54,stocks,Plus what‚Äôs their P/E like 11 well below other tech stocks
2021-06-23 03:58:15,stocks,Just curious why not AAPL?
2021-06-23 17:21:09,stocks,Grandmas stock üò¥üò¥. Apple and Microsoft so dam boring. These stocks are for lazy people
2021-06-22 20:58:50,stocks,Maybe look for the next Microsoft?
2021-06-23 09:41:43,stocks,"What I don‚Äôt like about Microsoft is they are losing their grip over the server operating system space and that‚Äôs going to bleed over into workstation operating systems. Linux distorts are becoming more and more widely used. I feel like legacy software is the only thing keeping companies on Windows. 

They also don‚Äôt have the leverage in cloud space that they once had in desktop operating systems. Amazon is far more popular among IT professionals."
2021-06-23 10:49:37,stocks,"Great buy and future prospects, but it's trading at a lofty valuation is the only reason I don't pile on."
2021-06-22 20:18:20,stocks,Feel like MSFT might as well be my savings account at this point lol
2021-06-23 14:19:02,stocks,If the ceo changes reevaluate. They can break the company. Dont just assume 10 years from now it will be the same.
2021-06-22 21:11:49,stocks,Yup. MSFT and APPL are never sells.
2021-06-23 12:25:58,stocks,Well it wasn't really a good buy during that time. There was a period from around 2002-2012 where they were pretty much stuck at $27. They really started to take off when they got into cloud.
2021-06-23 06:51:37,stocks,"100 trillion is not realistic lol that's 5x the U.S. GDP, the money has to come from somewhere. 

But Apple will definitely hit 10 trillion in the next few decades."
2021-06-22 20:58:28,stocks,It is FANMAG.  It's always been part in my book.
2021-06-23 07:27:32,stocks,"Been seeing, and sorry this may cause some to gag üòÑ, MAGA (microsoft, apple, google, amazon)"
2021-06-22 21:28:32,stocks,If you believe the general sentiment that $300 is a target in the next year then I'd argue so. That'd put it on par with Apple's current valuation
2021-06-22 20:59:19,stocks,Will MSFT be cheaper in 5 years? No!
2021-06-22 21:25:26,stocks,I mean it has reached a historic high. My question is whether you keep going with it. I'm specifically framing it around the upward price
2021-06-22 23:11:02,stocks,"Towards the end of last year, there were posts complaining about how MSFT and AMZN had been stagnant for months and were no longer buys (compared to what was trendier at the time), and now it's the other way around it seems."
2021-06-23 09:31:47,stocks,I also own Apple. Moreso posing the question around MSFT due to the growth. Apple became kind of hit and miss as a recommendation once they got so big. Does not seem like Microsoft is in that situation
2021-06-23 07:29:46,stocks,OP didn‚Äôt say not Apple
2021-06-23 09:49:39,stocks,"Both are solid companies, but imo I honestly don't like the way Apple is cannibalizing their balance sheet overtime for stuff like share buybacks. When the assets to liabilities ratio shrinks on a balance sheet that's usually a bad sign. It's still a strong balance sheet for now, but it's not as strong as it once was.

MSFT on the other hand still has a solid balance sheet, and is one of only 2 companies with a higher credit rating than the US government."
2021-06-22 23:00:09,stocks,"Provided Microsoft, Google, Amazon or Apple doesn't buy them first."
2021-06-23 17:20:06,stocks,"Same here. I bought some for less than $30 a share about 10 years ago. Looking at the current prices, it‚Äôs tough to get myself to buy more."
2021-06-22 20:19:16,stocks,Agree. MSFT and FBGRX i just pile cash into it. See you in 30 years
2021-06-23 09:24:04,stocks,"Yeah, it's like practically impossible to find a safer company than MSFT. They're one of only two companies in the world with a higher credit rating than the US government. They have enough cash on their balance sheets today to pay out something like 10 years worth of dividends.

If you had to a pick company who's not yet a dividend aristocrat who looks like they could one day become a dividend king then Microsoft would be at the top of that list, which speaks volumes for how safe of a long term investment they are even if you don't care for the dividends."
2021-06-23 11:30:57,stocks,It literally is mine. Lol
2021-06-23 06:50:15,stocks,Apple
2021-06-22 20:56:59,stocks,Better than a savings account.  What savings account gives a 10 to 50% return yoy??
2021-06-22 21:15:55,stocks,Not yet anyways.
2021-06-23 12:32:41,stocks,"Correct once Ballmer resigned it was off to the races. But you always have to look at total return and with the dividend that comes out to a lot. And if you reinvested them which I and many others did, well lets just say it was a GREAT buy. Again hindsight and at the time no one knew MSFT would reinvent themselves and revenue go off the charts! Never discount total return."
2021-06-23 09:14:30,stocks,"5x ‚Äòcurrent‚Äô GDP. 30 years ago US GDP was 2 trillion (apples current market cap now), 10 times smaller than current GDP. I said in my lifetime. Hopefully I have another 50-60 years to go. So we‚Äôll see"
2021-06-23 09:27:44,stocks,"MSFT & AAPL are international companies though, they aren't 100% dependent on just the US for their money.

But yeah, it does seem highly unlikely that either will ever be 5x the US GDP of that day."
2021-06-23 01:28:27,stocks,N is NVDA
2021-06-23 00:34:33,stocks,"True, I am long MSFT but just think some people forget the basics of investing"
2021-06-22 22:32:20,stocks,Wrong. You mean that would be on par with Apples ‚Äúmarket cap‚Äù not ‚Äúvaluation‚Äù. Big difference between the two. Apple is actually trading at a lower valuation than Microsoft rn.
2021-06-23 00:35:10,stocks,It's not the only investment opportunity.
2021-06-23 09:21:56,stocks,What about in 1 year
2021-06-22 23:46:41,stocks,Fspgx is a pretty similar fidelity etf with a much lower expense ratio.
2021-06-22 20:57:43,stocks,The world is ending in 5 years.
2021-06-23 00:04:33,stocks,What savings accounts has a std dev of 0.75??
2021-06-23 09:28:21,stocks,"I mean seeing Apple hit 100 trillion is my dream, I‚Äôd 50x my investment. So I hope you‚Äôre right lol"
2021-06-23 01:54:34,stocks,There are many fundamental reasons for that. Apple is expected to have lower phone sales and it hasn‚Äôt grown quite as consistently as Microsoft has for the past few years. Also Microsoft‚Äôs moat is larger imo.
2021-06-22 22:53:09,stocks,Good point. I was off on that. I was reading his comment as market cap which is obviously what I was referencing
2021-06-23 01:37:26,stocks,You're right but it's solid.

2021-06-23 00:11:21,stocks,Well put your money in savings then for 0.05%.
2021-06-23 07:38:46,stocks,"I never once said the reason why Apple has a lower valuation than Microsoft. All I said is that market cap is different from valuation and Apple has a lower valuation than Microsoft. Was never trying to argue why in the first place but go off. Also your points on Apple are completely wrong. ‚ÄúHasnt grown as consistently as Microsoft in the past few years.‚Äù Apple is currently up 460% in the last 5 years and Microsoft has grown 420% in the last 5 years so you are completely wrong on that point. Also you do realize that Apple has other products besides the Iphone right? They sell phones, computers, tablets, watches, headphones, and other subscription services. The iphone currently makes up the bulk of their revenue but they are growing their other products in the double digits every quarter. Plus they are working on medical devices and AR technology which has been confirmed."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Canadian Single-sports Betting Approved by the Senate Source: [https://www.thescore.com/nhl/news/2182004](https://www.thescore.com/nhl/news/2182004)

Single-game sports betting is set to become legal in Canada after Bill C-218, the Safe and Regulated Sports Betting Act, was [officially passed](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&billId=10866122) in the Senate of Canada on Tuesday.

The private member's bill - sponsored by Conservative MP Kevin Waugh (Saskatoon-Grasswood) - passed without amendment, by a vote of 57 to 20 (five abstentions). Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government will decide on a date when the legalization of single-game sports betting will take effect.

The bill signals a major shift in Canada: single-game sports betting has been legal in the country but only via parlay wagers. Canadians will now have the ability to bet on single-game matches across sports (excluding horse racing), with the government set to collect taxes on estimated billions of dollars currently being wagered illegally.

Waugh issued a [statement](https://kevinwaugh.ca/mp-waugh-statement-on-passage-of-single-sports-betting-bill-in-the-senate/) Tuesday evening celebrating the passage of the bill, calling it ""a victory for Canadian sport, sport fans, and businesses."" He added:

>Following this legislation becoming law, provincial governments will be responsible for implementing regulations and wagering operators in their jurisdictions. I call on provincial governments to act as quickly as possible to get the necessary regulations and licenses in place so that all Canadians can begin to place their wagers."

$CO   - Great uptrend and we are falling into value. I obviously wouldn't catch a falling knife, but this is a perfect spot to see some possible life and support form.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

$EA   - A really nice ascending triangle here as we hope to pressure the $148 resistance once again. Maybe only 6% with no breakout, but very little risk buying in here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

$GIII - Newer channel up forming as we have consistent higher lows here. Once again we have an amazing value and we hope to see it keep this pattern going strong.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

$PAG  - Falling knife right into value, we have to hope it holds. Very obvious resistance trendline, if you're nervous wait to break that to keep it moving.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

$TCS  - One last horizontal triangle forming we are seeing some nice consolidation. Wait for a trend break to really go long if you please, but you won't get a much better deal than here."

Used as a sort of LinkedIn for 80% of US doctors, so it seems like the healthcare community has greater trust in it than other Telehealth providers. Honestly looks like a great future potential buyout target by Teladoc. Would love to hear some more opinions though. That is why I am bringing this to the virtual water-cooler that is reddit.

What their revenue and earnings will look like post-pandemic will be of great interest to determine whether I continue to HODL or just cash out, but my personal thought is that, for all the shit the pandemic wrought, it ushered in the legitimacy of telehealth and that's not going away ever."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, June 22, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 22, 2021**

The stock market rose again today, driven by a continued rally in tech stocks and tempered inflationary fears. The Nasdaq (QQQ) reached a fresh record high for the second time this week and the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover following its worst week since October 2020. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.54% higher and is two points away from its record high. With earnings for Q2 fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data ‚Äì an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

Today, in a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, ‚ÄúWe will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.‚Äù He went on to further say recent price increases ‚Äúdon‚Äôt speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates‚Äù but come from factors ‚Äúdirectly affected by the reopening‚Äù. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a ‚Äúbroad set of labor market statistics‚Äù before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said ‚ÄúWe will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures‚Ä¶. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared‚Äù. 

As expected, response by lawmakers to Powell‚Äôs testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. 

On Thursday, the Fed is set to release the results of its ‚Äústress test‚Äù on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.

Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the boar

The company has been around for over 20 years and never made a profit. They also have no major products unless you consider the fuel cells they sell for forklifts which they barely sell. The company has been caught faking their financials and have been sued by multiple investment firms because of it. They are also currently trading at a ridiculous valuation that no way affects their earnings or projected earnings. They dilute shares massively as well. They are basically a Nikola 2.0. Not saying this company cant stage a huge comeback and become the largest supplier of hydrogen fuel cells in the world and make billions but the chances of that happening are slim to none.

Comapre to hydroeen where green is possible but rare since most plants use natural gas in its production, which is a byproduct of gossile fuel extraction. Also a *major problem* with hydrogen is that it is *extremely volatile*, a simple car crash could kill more people then most modern car bombs.



In Sweden we had hydrogen busses on trial. One was in an accident and emergency drives had to *evacuate a full city block* due to the risk of destruction if the hydrogen was ignited.

>Microsoft Corp. took its place in the history books as just the second U.S. public company to reach a $2 trillion market value, buoyed by bets its dominance in cloud computing and enterprise software will expand further in a post-coronavirus world.
>
>Its shares rose as much as 1.1% to $265.64 on Tuesday in New York, enough for the software company to join Apple Inc. as one of only two companies trading at such a lofty value. Saudi Aramco eclipsed that threshold briefly in December 2019, but currently has a market value of about $1.9 trillion.

5G, yup, good example. Being in the IT/tech sector, I have been watching them sneak up in damn near every area. BI/big data and security are two examples of areas where people don‚Äôt realize that MSFT has been undermining the competition silently.

I dumped loads of stock in companies that offer a solution here/there (Fortinet is a great example), and rolled it over to Microsoft. Some of these companies offer good services, and maybe even do a bit better than Microsoft in that particular area. But it‚Äôs laughable to choose a set of numerous, disparate vendors in an effort to get a solution that is all of 10% better but doesn‚Äôt integrate. Seriously, you‚Äôre crazy if you go that route.

One of these days, the world is going to wake up and realize that they‚Äôre paying vendors to solve miscellaneous problems, and yet they could have been paying Microsoft even less to make everything more efficient and secure."

Game pass is a few good titles and lots of crap games, much like Netflix had cheap nature documentaries and shit to say ""thousand sof titles available"" (98% is crap you'll never want but...big number is good).



Same applies here, the *second* game pass proves even remotely profitable well see competition. We saw it happen to Netflix with competitors streaming, we saw it happen on PC with competing storefronts (Gog etc). MS without third party publishers/games simply isn't enough...



Sony on the other hand is surely late to the whole ""digital party"". That said they got *stellar first party games/studios"" and create new AAA IPs with success. Further more their consoles are selling like hotcakes, Ps4 was a stellar success depaite all and Ps5 is so far outselling it.

Then if earnings grow another 20% the following year, it's a $600+ stock in 2 years.

Ontop of this people also buy square on the hopes of them becoming a big major financial player but also ignore fb tryna get into the space also using their moat and marketplace to their advantage. 

The list goes on yet people still ignore fb potential, i mean if theirs anyone who can potentially rival amazon in e-commerce it‚Äôd probably be fb with an existing user base and cash flow to burn. This isn‚Äôt even mentioning everything else they work on too.

There's just too much to work with for an ongoing project like that, so random sampling is needed and will have some level of error. In the short run, this means there is a little uncertainty.

2021-06-23 10:16:29,stocks,"Your response question while fair, misses the point.  Reality itself and an understanding of how inflation rate is calculated and presented by the US Government both define how the numbers presented are a complete fallacy.  I suggest you go look at how the reported inflation rate is calculated, what is included in those metrics and most especially everything that is left out (purposefully, to present a lower than real number).  Then go look at the real world prices of the durable goods, real-property and other metrics over the last 10, 20,30 years.  You will realize the ""inflation rate"" is all smoke and mirrors very quickly.  You need to think about how the macro-economic cogs work in our country and how the populace is not supposed to understand how inflation is artificially driven to cover debt,  how debt drives the economy and how the cyclical nature of it all keeps us moving forward.  If the real numbers were presented to your average person, it would scare the daylights out of them when they realized that their dollars are meaningless and becoming more worthless every day and that the debt that hangs over their head is really what keeps them alive as it is a funding mechanism artificially driven out by making the debt itself less valuable."

This is absolutely TERRIBLE for Peloton. Effectively, they will be bricking treadmills if you don't subscribe. Some places, like Australia, have consumer laws regarding this.

I don't think it is unreasonable to say that treadmill no longer working is a major problem which would have prevented the consumer from purchasing had they known prior to the purchase.

And no, they're not gonna be able to argue that the treadmill is not broken because it works with a subscription.

Considering you can't even buy the tread at this time, it is clear that they are putting safety first here.  I'm sure that they are not looking to have people return the tread simply over $39/month.

I have a computer program that I use for my work that requires a dongle.  The company said that they needed the dongles back after I have had it for 10 years because they are switching to an online subscription.  So now if I want to use the program, I am forced to pay for an updated version every year or I have nothing.  I kept the dongle and said no to the subscription."

2021-06-23 07:44:07,stocks,Cricut tried doing this with their devices a few months ago and quickly backtracked on it. They tried making anyone that wants to use their required software pay a subscription or else their machines wouldn't be able to cut anything.
2021-06-23 08:03:34,stocks,"How the HELL did they think this was a good idea?? A making a $4,000 treadmill unusable without a subscription AFTER you purchase it.

This is what a consumer hellscape looks like."
2021-06-23 08:10:57,stocks,"You all are acting like this wasn't their plan. The sale of a peloton is a one time thing, once enough people have them, they won't buy a new one for several years. But, if your peloton only works if you pay a $40 subscription every month, then boom, continuous revenue. It's just the same sales model as adobe photoshop or microsoft 365."

2021-06-23 09:04:37,stocks,Why would they do this when owners have an option to return the treadmill until November of next year?
2021-06-23 09:05:06,stocks,"> Under the current conditions of the voluntary recall, Tread+ owners can return their treadmill for a full refund."
2021-06-23 09:06:47,stocks,"You see, as an app user now I have no reason to get a machine. I can just prop my phone or iPad in front of whatever tread or bike and follow along. The experience isn‚Äôt that much different."

Who would buy a treadmill that you HAD to subscribe to JUST TO USE??? 

Not many."

2021-06-23 09:47:18,stocks,I don't own a Peloton but I'm sick of everything requiring a subscription service. Soon you'll need a subscription service to drive on public roads.
2021-06-23 09:55:43,stocks,so everyone that already has one is forced to subscribe otherwise they can't even use it? LOL. Saps.

2021-06-23 11:17:06,stocks,John deer first and now Ford and peloton are following in their footsteps. Making everything proprietary and useless. 2021 F-150‚Äôs have a auto shutoff feature that bricks the truck if below 20% oil life and more than 1 qt of oil lost during electronic measurement. Can only unbrick with Ford programming device. John deer was the first company to instill this practice with industrial grade farming equipment. Now peloton bricking their treadmills unless users come to them to resubscribe‚Ä¶  can‚Äôt wait for this new generation of companies
2021-06-23 11:22:34,stocks,That is outrageous.
2021-06-23 11:25:36,stocks,"Goddammit, I'm a big fan of the stock but they keep handling things very stupidly."

2021-06-23 13:26:43,stocks,Sounds like what BMW was thinking of doing with their heated seats. Personally I wouldn‚Äôt buy any product that requires a subscription to use but the average Peloton customer is middle class so maybe they won‚Äôt care
2021-06-23 13:31:32,stocks,Peloton is great. Long term hold
2021-06-23 13:43:33,stocks,Peloton trying to coerce/nudge people into monthly subscription.  I guess they figured they won't be selling more of the equipment's now that society is opening up!
2021-06-23 14:20:11,stocks,"This thread is a good indicator to buy shares in Peleton.  For me Pele is a buy under $100.  Don't own the stock, but I regret not buying calls when it briefly dipped 80s - seemed so obvious.

My biggest concern is that I'm waiting for Apple to pull out their own bike and make billions off that."
2021-06-23 01:26:46,stocks,"Most ""investors"" aren't seeing the big picture and are confusing noise from actual news.  
  
When the tread killed that kid, I channel checked with sales people at Peloton, and the exact words ""we have had more interest in the tread now that its no longer for sale than ever""  
  
Logic that the masses employ is exactly that, average run of the mill logic. Money is made betting on a contrarian and often misperceived ""truth"". People buy into the FUD headline news without realizing the knock on effects or the second and third order effects. The smart money is making bets on significant trends such as connected fitness and the managements moves into corporate wellness programs and commercial fitness equipment market to maintain momentum as reopening goes into full swing. Also, people forget that Peloton isnt a global brand yet, its only US, UK, Australia and Mexico at the moment. The TAM is fucken massive and ripe for expansion.  
  
TAM isnt gym goers, literally the product was developed for people who are anti gym but want to get fit and feel connected in a community (err I mean cult). Read Peter Thiels 0 to 1 book and PTON hits all 4 points of what is a company/product you look for.  
  
I am a massive buyer and see a $180-200 PT based on 40% revenue growth rates over the next decade. Thats only about $80B in market cap for an aspirational brand and market leader in the space. Growing pains is normal, we can teach and coach around that, but the aspirational brand and vibe? Can't teach that."
2021-06-23 03:24:42,stocks,This is great for peloton.  More revenue.
2021-06-23 05:30:50,stocks,Quite honestly the way our society is trending towards allowing corporations and material items to completely own us I‚Äôd be shocked if the Peloton owners didn‚Äôt just go along with it and pay for the subscription. They‚Äôre being bricked Ofcourse but anyone buying a Peloton at that price point is doing it for the social value aspects and the allure of the program. These device and app makers can have near total control once they get their hooks in you. Maybe in countries outside the US this won‚Äôt go over so well but I imagine they‚Äôll do just fine here in America.
2021-06-23 10:25:11,stocks,Peloton isn‚Äôt an equipment company so this makes sense. Surprised it wasn‚Äôt in place from the start.

2021-06-23 09:20:36,stocks,"I‚Äôm in shock! This is awful news. The amount of negative events/news tied to this treadmill is astounding. First the insufficient safety concerns and now this?

The company would be better off just removing this machine from their line up or giving excess to gyms for free just to get rid of it. If they wanted data that badly or a subscription based business model, they could *maybe* partner with gyms so a percentage of memberships is provided to Peloton for providing the machines, along with the data profiles for those gym members. 

Regardless, I think it‚Äôs safe to say Peloton is on its way out unless they can fix the damage they‚Äôve done."
2021-06-23 11:24:02,stocks,"Why is everyone acting surprised? This was their whole business model:  
Idiots pay big money for expensive exercise machine.  
Idiots pay expensive subscription fee necessary to use expensive exercise machine.  
Issue IPO and get more fool's money.  
Profit.  


It combined the worst aspects of the health & fitness field with the technology field.  
Stop subscribing? Enjoy your $3000 paper weight.  


Here's an alternative:  
Go on Craigslist - look for a ""old fashioned"" (read: Non-IOT enabled) tread mill. Buy it for cheap. Attach a tablet to the front of it. Read books or watch Netflix while running.  
Congratulations. you have made your own Peloton.  
Oh, you want it to track your progress? Buy an Apple watch or some other wearable, connect it to your phone or the attached tablet.   
Oh, you want somebody to talk to you while running?  
Go on the internet and pay someone to yell encouragement via Zoom/Skype, any communications system. (I feel this could become a Fiverr gig - ""I will yell at you to lose weight"")  
All of the above suggestions probably come in below the $3000 cost for the Peloton equipment."

2021-06-22 21:07:17,stocks,"Peloton may have pretty bone headed management, but injuries from exercise equipment are really common and the machines also have a safety key that can be removed to prevent children from using them.

There were 22,500 (treated) treadmill-related injuries in the US in 2019, mostly adults, about 2000 children (meaning they had to go to a doctor). Injuries related to exercise equipment should not be so shocking if you see the statistics. About 3 deaths average a year on treadmills. That is just treadmills. Peloton has not cornered the market on treadmill safety issues, just media reaction to them."

2021-06-23 09:59:32,stocks,"Isn't the bike essentially bricked as well if you don't have a subscription? I personally use a third party bike (was MUCH cheaper) and use the Peloton app to workout on it. I had thought their bike screens won't work either unless you use their service.

Another thing about their model that makes no sense to me, is how they make users who buy their equipment pay $40 / month for the app, while people like me who use third party bikes or treadmills only pay $13 / month."
2021-06-23 06:19:10,stocks,"They pulled the ‚Äújust run‚Äù free feature because their treadmill killed a child on video and now they need to get everyone to agree to not hold them liable.

2021-06-23 08:56:17,stocks,"While this is true and should be noted, it shouldn't go without saying that their messaging of this change was absolute shit. All you have to say is:

""We are working on an update to our Tread + machines that will allow all of our users to enable Tread Lock with or without a membership. Until those updates can be made and rolled out to our user base, we are giving all Tread + machines free access to our membership platform which includes Tread Lock. We value our members and their friends and families safety over everything we do at Peloton. 

Be assured, your machine will continue to work as it always has until we can properly test and roll out these important updates. Until then, enjoy all the benefits of our membership as a way for us to say thank you for bearing with us as we work tirelessly to fix this issue that should never have happened.""

Is that so hard? The way the email they sent out reads makes it look like they are bricking the treadmill so I don't blame people for being pissed off."

This is actually a very good thing."
2021-06-23 12:38:14,stocks,"Can't believe I had to scroll so far to find someone pointing out the truth. If I had to guess, the reason for this weird temporary fix is because they'll have to rewrite a lot of code because their software architecture wasn't built to support the permanent fix  for free Peloton users.

2021-06-23 01:23:15,stocks,"Most ""investors"" aren't seeing the big picture and are confusing noise from actual news.

When the tread killed that kid, I channel checked with sales people at Peloton, and the exact words ""we have had more interest in the tread now that its no longer for sale than ever""

Logic that the masses employ is exactly that, average run of the mill logic. Money is made betting on a contrarian and often misperceived ""truth"". People buy into the FUD headline news without realizing the knock on effects or the second and third order effects. The smart money is making bets on significant trends such as connected fitness and the managements moves into corporate wellness programs and commercial fitness equipment market to maintain momentum as reopening goes into full swing. Also, people forget that Peloton isnt a global brand yet, its only US, UK, Australia and Mexico at the moment. The TAM is fucken massive and ripe for expansion.

TAM isnt gym goers, literally the product was developed for people who are anti gym but want to get fit and feel connected in a community (err I mean cult). Read Peter Thiels 0 to 1 book and PTON hits all 4 points of what is a company/product you look for.

I am a massive buyer and see a $180-200 PT based on 40% revenue growth rates over the next decade. Thats only about $80B in market cap for an aspirational brand and market leader in the space. Growing pains is normal, we can teach and coach around that, but the aspirational brand and vibe? Can't teach that."
2021-06-22 22:59:40,stocks,I'd say it's bad for the brand reputation. I would compare it too the Xbox One's push for always online. It really damaged Xbox's imagine and help Sony take back control of the console gaming space. Even if they walked it back it demonstrates to anyone thinking of buying it that they are willing to make you have to pay extra to use the basic functionality of a regular treadmill.

2021-06-23 08:51:22,stocks,"respectfully, yes you are missing something. it's easy to bash a company like this is you aren't able to look outside of the scope of your own personal preference. A LOT of people enjoy working out from home for various reasons. Intimidation, fear, convenience, germaphobe, the list goes on. Check out a few of the exercise equipment manufacturers, a lot are still largely sold out of equipment. That tells me people are still building home gyms. Of course, many will return to the gym. Many will not, also. I think the at-home fitness industry, specifically tech-connected fitness, will disrupt the gym industry to a degree. 

People don't understand why you would need a subscription service for your exercise, but are forgetting how many people are only extrinsically motivated to workout, they completely rely on those virtual classes/trainers. I personally wouldn't use the service as i'm a gym rat, but i completely understand it and believe this industry has a good future going forward. 

No position in PTON"

2021-06-22 21:56:29,stocks,"Yeah, no way it will maintain the structural integrity necessary to hold clothes if you don't keep the subscription updated."

2021-06-22 20:43:21,stocks,That‚Äôs exactly what the person who created this fake news wants you to do.  Someone wants to see the stock drop.
2021-06-23 01:00:40,stocks,At least you‚Äôre honest about not having a clue about it. They shouldn‚Äôt mind because they get 3 months free while this is sorted. Then the feature will be reinstated after it‚Äôs safe to do so.

You can't be serious.

This is the equivalent of buying a million dollar house and then fitting it with a 200 dollar electric Whirlpool range from Home Depot, even though that Whirlpool range does the same thing as a 8,000 dollar Viking or Wolf range.

People who buy this thing don't care about paying a subscription fee. Most likely their work subsidizes it for them anyways as part of a fitness/wellness subsidy.

The same people don't care about paying a $550 fee every year to have a metallic credit card either.

2021-06-23 07:05:12,stocks,What about tractors?
2021-06-23 08:55:05,stocks,"The software stops doing its sexy planning and management, but the tractor can still be driven."
2021-06-22 22:23:00,stocks,"That‚Äôs fine upfront though, known prior to purchase of said tractor.

Even shops like mine who work on them pay a subscription fee."
2021-06-23 00:41:33,stocks,This is not the same..
2021-06-23 08:19:11,stocks,"I have yet to meet someone who has read every word and line of it. You're right. As consumers, we do have to agree to terms to turn it on and use it, but that's the point - we can still use the phone. Apple isn't charging us a monthly subscription fee to send texts, check emails, and watch YouTube videos. 

I don't have a Peloton anything, so I could be mistaken in how I'm wording this, but it seems like if you have a Peloton treadmill, you can't just hop on and run if free run is taken away. You can turn it on and I imagine that's about it."
2021-06-23 08:23:17,stocks,"Apple doesn't have cellphone plans. It would be different if third parties were allowed on the Peloton platform. Maybe they are, I don't know."
2021-06-23 09:52:18,stocks,Apple is not selling you data service. They‚Äôre selling you the device. Your example is like saying you have to buy a ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù for a car in the form of purchasing fuel.
2021-06-23 08:29:36,stocks,"The point here is that they are changing it after the sale has already been made. So no, not like a cell phone plan. What you are referring to is more like leasing and a pretty standard business practice."
2021-06-23 08:42:39,stocks,Good thing I drive a Toyota!
2021-06-22 21:33:13,stocks,"Odd, last I checked I could buy an iPhone and use all apps, camera and whatnot without a sim. In fact I can use all included features except call/text which require a separate service, it's not like the *iPhone itself stops working* so please, try a better analogy"

2021-06-23 08:23:49,stocks,I'm a Caterpillar guy
2021-06-23 08:25:32,stocks,"You're right. After a while, they do stop supporting older phones forcing upgrades. But you could still use your phone for very basic purposes like only texting and only calling - granted those aren't the only reasons we have smartphones. You get the idea, though."
2021-06-22 21:32:04,stocks,"What license fee do I have to pay before I read books or watch dvds? None.


I own my vehicles, the manufacturer probably doesn't even make this model any more lol. My doctor? Free of charge, god bless my home country"
2021-06-23 07:42:48,stocks,"Not sure, it seems to be to customers who kicked off a fuss

I work in a research lab and we use their equipment everyday and before they announced they were backtracking for previous customers, they already got an email from our legal team and told us we were ‚Äúunlimited free forever‚Äù"
2021-06-23 07:45:44,stocks,They did a few days after the announcement

2021-06-22 21:14:23,stocks,"As a peloton (bike) owner and previous investor, I‚Äôm so amazed by how terrible their leadership and moves have been recently. They built an incredible product- their motivation system and quality/ variety of classes is amazing. They have a cult following. 

I still love the product but feel they are going to run their future into the ground. I withdrew my investment along time ago. I hope the product as a user stays the same."
2021-06-23 06:32:03,stocks,Totally have a Lulu vibe.  My urge to short peloton is part emotion and part real strategy.  Garbage leadership
2021-06-23 07:08:25,stocks,Best comment.
2021-06-23 08:09:18,stocks,"Maybe. They could turn it around, and even if they don't bad management sometimes takes multiple years to ruin a company (even 2023 puts may not be long enough to realize a good profit).   

Plus Peloton would be a great buyout target for a FAANG company (in particular Apple). If that happens you lose."
2021-06-23 11:59:30,stocks,Revenue will increase.
2021-06-22 23:00:54,stocks,"3 deaths a year and one of them is a Peloton is really bad optics for a niche, expensive new product."
2021-06-22 21:48:19,stocks,It doesn‚Äôt matter one bit how often the injuries actually happen. What matters is how often injuries are being publicized.
2021-06-23 11:04:08,stocks,That‚Äôs just OnlyFans
2021-06-23 08:36:51,stocks,"I agree with you. IoT is a great concept for convenience.

But it also opened a door for: 
- Advertisements,
- software updates that can disable features( like in this case),
- Data collection from companies 

Hopefully they don‚Äôt try to pull that with Precor.

[NEW YORK, April 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON), the leading interactive fitness platform, today announced that it has officially closed the acquisition of Precor, one of the largest global commercial fitness equipment providers with a significant U.S. manufacturing presence.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peloton-completes-precor-acquisition-301261010.html)"
2021-06-23 01:10:13,stocks,"Because it's not *pure design* enough... or, not high enough priority for them to do it to Apple standards.

Same reason some of the default apps are kinda shitty."
2021-06-23 01:46:15,stocks,"Because both brands have the same consumer base and Apple would rather acquire Peloton than risk competing with them. I‚Äôm very confident Peloton will be a part of the Apple Fitness+ platform by the end of 2022, much like Beats became Apple Music in 2016."
2021-06-23 09:52:14,stocks,"Because Apple doesn't want to make exercise equipment. 

Apple could succeed in almost any industry by just making a quality product that works with their devices. Their standard for entering a new industry is not simply whether or not they could succeed, it's whether or not it would be worth their time effort."
2021-06-23 01:10:42,stocks,"Seems like they should wait for stock to crash, first."
2021-06-22 21:27:41,stocks,"Apple created and branded exercise machines are different from 3rd parties that sync to Apple products.

The Apple brand is strong enough that Apple could  provide the exact same functionality as those 3rd parties and a bunch of people would buy it at the prices Peloton charges."
2021-06-23 11:30:40,stocks,"You are correct. I own the bike and it‚Äôs useless for anything unless you have the subscription. You can turn it on and pedal but that‚Äôs about it. No speed, cadence, watts or classes. 

I wasn‚Äôt aware of the large price difference for non-Peloton users. That‚Äôs nuts."
2021-06-23 11:58:31,stocks,"Probably due to sunk cost. People who bought the peloton are locked in. People on third party equipment can easily use their equipment with or without peloton, so more likely to balk at a high price"
2021-06-23 07:34:55,stocks,"Something tells me they have arbitration clauses in the existing user agreements that protect from liability. Since they did a recall and created a passcode feature, I don‚Äôt understand how this is any different than injuries resulting from a regular treadmill. They‚Äôve changed their minds on removing the feature, so I guess the entire story turns in to free publicity. 

Either way, running outside sounds safer‚Ä¶and cheaper."
2021-06-23 07:37:26,stocks,"Horrifying. 

I don‚Äôt understand how that didn‚Äôt come up in QA."
2021-06-23 15:46:15,stocks,"It's hard to do when the rest of the email is cut off. Bad PR? Yes. Bad journalism? Also yes. Intentional hit-job? Probably.

Edit: Intentional hit-job? Definitely. The ""update"" at the end of the piece contradicts the whole storyline of the article, but still implies that Peloton intends to fuck over its customers."

Nothing I'd pay for but apparently plenty of people do."

2021-06-23 02:33:39,stocks,"The things is this was frontpage on another sub and someone there already explained this. 

It appears no one here is capable of a quick search to fact-check such claims. What a shame!"
2021-06-23 00:53:50,stocks,Yeah and people are downvoting you for pointing it out lol. People on this sub want so badly to be right.
2021-06-22 23:25:01,stocks,Sounds like an unsustainable business model. Bearish on outside
2021-06-22 22:59:57,stocks,The view is better too.
2021-06-22 21:53:21,stocks,"Exactly, fitness trends change so much and so many people cannot keep consistent workout regimens that it's just too unstable to invest in one for a really long term"
2021-06-22 21:45:38,stocks,"equivalent bikes are 500-700 ish on amazon

seriously insane how expensive peloton is."
2021-06-22 21:24:29,stocks,Oh fully agree. I already paused my subscription for two months.
2021-06-22 23:36:45,stocks,$40 covers the entire household (unlimited memberships) vs the $14 app-based is for a single user.

2021-06-23 13:35:15,stocks,"lol. No joke. back in the 80s when bottle water first came around, we thought people were stupid to buy it. Now its everywhere."
2021-06-22 23:23:19,stocks,"For sure.  ~$20 a month for access to any club in the country + unlimited relax/tanning access.  

And back when I used to travel a lot I never visited a club that wasn't well maintained.  

I should've picked up more shares back when it bottomed out last year during Covid."
2021-06-23 09:37:52,stocks,"Yeah

When I was in the US I used one of these as my temp gym.

Some loser told me to stop deadlifting lol."
2021-06-23 09:30:08,stocks,Planet fitness doesn‚Äôt have free weights. They have dumbbells up to like 50 lbs I think

2021-06-23 00:58:00,stocks,But they didn‚Äôt make anyone pay. They are giving free months while it‚Äôs taken care of.
2021-06-23 00:48:48,stocks,Peloton is giving them 3 months of free subscription while they work on this.  So they are not making anyone pay any money.
2021-06-23 00:06:48,stocks,Because they have investors and the litigation cost will be much lower than the long term benefit.
2021-06-23 03:22:26,stocks,Was it your baby that got killed?
2021-06-23 03:29:30,stocks,Yeah that was impressive after a -30% skid
2021-06-23 13:55:40,stocks,"You can also get from here to there in a Toyota rather than a Mercedes.

You can carry stuff around in a generic handbag rather than a Chanel.

You can tell time with a Timex rather than a Rolex.

You can get credit using a Capital One credit card, rather than a 550/year silver or dark blue metallic credit card.

The demand is still there and people want to buy this thing. Why are you questioning people's behavior? There's a reason people want a Peloton.

It's a luxury good.

If you need to question ""why?"", sorry mate, you're not the target demographic."
2021-06-23 09:54:37,stocks,"This is true. But most people with a tread also have a bike, and they‚Äôre already in the Peloton ecosystem.

Additionally, the Tread is so much better than an ordinary treadmill. The running experience is totally different.

So even though this seems on paper to be a bad idea, I don‚Äôt think the impact is going to be bad at all. I don‚Äôt expect it to be reflected in the stock price."
2021-06-22 23:10:27,stocks,"Markets dumb, it‚Äôll tank when people are scared off from buying more."

2021-06-23 04:57:29,stocks,seems like bullshit to me
2021-06-23 14:03:03,stocks,! Wow
2021-06-23 15:48:58,stocks,Feels like apple is leaving money on the table.  They are kings in consumer tech hardware and eeverything can be tied into their ecosystem and wearables and brand.  Bundle the subscription into a package with music/tv.
2021-06-23 00:59:47,stocks,"Im scared my printer is going to do this. The ink cartridges you get through the subscription stop working if you cancel, even if they have ink in them."
2021-06-23 02:07:19,stocks,At some point people need to stop buying stuff they don't control fully.  The ~~cake~~ cloud is a lie.
2021-06-22 22:41:47,stocks,"Yep, I thought it was free because the free trial starts automatically. Then after you set it all up and it's running for a month, then they hit you with the paid subscription. 

It's priced cheap enough to where it's not worth uninstalling the hardware. It's infuriating but incredibly smart."
2021-06-22 22:21:35,stocks,"What the fuck, ring was the one I wanted for home security...nope now"
2021-06-23 08:58:51,stocks,I have a ring security system. It works just like simplisafe. No subscription required. I imagine the camera's aren't designed for local data storage.
2021-06-23 02:02:08,stocks,"Part of what I like about ubiquiti cameras is that everything is done locally and features aren't locked out because you didn't pay for the premium subscription, it is more complicated to set up and requires on premises storage, but far cheaper in the long run"
2021-06-23 04:59:05,stocks,What do you mean by custom boundaries?
2021-06-23 06:00:21,stocks,"Whoa ‚Ä¶ even though [it looks like you're talking about multiple Ring units](https://www.safehome.org/doorbell-cameras/ring/) they're a lot more expensive than I expected.

I'd almost expect thieves to be stealing the Rings at that point!  (yes, yes, if they need to be on a network they could be remotely bricked after theft, but still)"
2021-06-23 06:57:44,stocks,"That's a bit different because all security systems include ""monitoring"" fees. I'm not sure if you actually get anything from Ring other than the ability to use the equipment though.  Someone could probably push it in court if there's literally no service being offered for the subscriptiong, just not here in the US.   They could also just say it is for access to Ring's ""servers.""  Basically you're paying them to spy on you."
2021-06-23 09:05:45,stocks,"This is false. Ring owner here. The only features you have to pay for is advanced detection of people, and the ability to see and save non live views. Those features cost $3 a month per camera or $10 a month for all cameras."
2021-06-23 09:20:33,stocks,"There has to balance how Silo ing thier customers in to their ecosystem

2021-06-23 00:44:20,stocks,"After hearing about this I won't ever buy their product unless they stop this overt attempt at a money grab. Even then, I'd probably go with any of the emerging competitors who don't have this awful track record."

2021-06-23 02:23:41,stocks,"No it's not. 

Peloton customer service stated 'Just Run' is no longer available without a membership and 3 months of All-Access membership has been waived for all owners.  

This was supposed to be for safety. Apparently after some initial backlash a spokesperson said that the safety lock feature was only available for those with a membership and it is working on updating this so 'Just run' can be used again. All in the name of safety of course (BULLSHIT). 

Peloton just tried to force people that bought a $2.5k+ machine to subscribe to a $40/month membership and realized that it won't go over very smoothly so they are back peddling."

2021-06-23 05:29:52,stocks,I agree and quite honestly the way our society is trending towards allowing corporations and material items to completely own us I‚Äôd be shocked if the Peloton owners didn‚Äôt just go along with it and pay for the subscription. They‚Äôre being bricked Ofcourse but anyone buying a Peloton at that price point is doing it for the social value aspects and the allure of the program. These device and app makers can have near total control once they get their hooks in you. Maybe in countries outside the US this won‚Äôt go over so we‚Äôll but I imagine they‚Äôll do just fine here in America.
2021-06-23 06:48:47,stocks,"Came here to say this. There are plenty of quality treadmills that don‚Äôt cost over $2000. You‚Äôre paying to be part of the Peloton program, not just run."
2021-06-23 06:08:33,stocks,"I can never understand why someone would pay thousands of dollars for a glorified mouse wheel, when perfectly fine models normally cost a few hundreds. 

It's a fad, and the stock will implode when it goes out of fashion.

With this announcement it may even go faster. So what if it's a bit up in after/pre market. Let's see how it plays out."
2021-06-23 08:12:53,stocks,"This can easily mean they produce less units for more subscriptions. That's a net win. Peloton's business isn't selling treadmills, it's selling subscriptions to content. Subscriptions cost Peloton nothing to ""make""."

This is another thing I didn't touch on.  Advertisements invading *every* quiet moment of life, because IOT (and apps) specifically enables it.

I never thought to appreciate the minute of quiet while pumping gas until I started getting barked at by the pump to CONSUME PRODUCT.  It's already sneaking into Smart TVs, and if you have the McDonalds App installed on your phone?  It randomly does the fucking mcdonalds jingle throughout the day, even when it's just in your pocket.  (no I didn't install it, a friend did and the jingle kept going off.

The Peloton bike is decently made and has a huge swing out 22‚Äù screen. The Schwinn ic4/Bowflex 6 are good bikes that you can use an iPhone/iPad with and work with almost any app - Zwift , peloton, RGT, Rouvy, FulGaz, etc. Few cheaper bikes work with all the apps right. The $39 peloton subscription with the bike vs $13 without is weird, though I would add the $39 subscription is per household not person like the $13 one.

I've been administering apple devices with ASM/DEP/JAMF since before any of that even existed.. all the way back to 10.4 and the original iPhone.. Your belief in whether I'm correct is not needed or required.

If you want to go back to a prior version of iOS, just find the ISPW file that you want and DFU mode it. There are a few ""difficult"" iOS versions, I'll give you that, but most are not.

Apps? The only restriction is if its a 32 bit app that the developer didn't move to 64 bit. Apps aren't just wiped from your device if they are removed from the app store though. I had an unsupported app on my iphone 5 for a while, the developer of the app just shifted to a new app name/title, but the old one was always still there, it just eventually grew less and less useful as it aged out and it became unsupported. Your own apps? You must have missed the boat when Cydia was all the rage in the jailbreak scene. 

If you want older OSX versions just find an ISO or put it into internet recovery mode and you can download the original version that came on the device when new.

If you want to go past what is allowed (like big sur on an unsupported model) there's a whole subreddit for it, or you can look up folks like DOSDude."

This much is easily proven by comparative research (I did mine a few months ago while trying to find a budget-friendly alternative for my wife when her iPhone broke). Why do people believe it's a better product, then? Because of brand marketing. People see Apple brand, and automatically think ""better product,"" without actually comparing.
You're correct that it's not a status symbol like it used to be (iPhone = look at me, I made it, I have an iPhone), but it is a symbol that people pay extra to carry. Apple brand isn't elite any more, but it's still brand marketing at it's core, and it's the brand the people buy. The status is a different status, but it's a status still."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Dollar Cost Averaging vs. Lump Sum Investing | Analysis **TLDR:** If you sell your house and have an extra $20k in your bank account you want to invest and let's assume you decide you can't predict the stock market and want to just enter the market.... Don't DCA. Just dump it in the stock market that day and that approach will have been better than DCA 68% of the time. 

&#x200B;

**The Analysis:**

I've seen a lot of people talk about the benefits of [dollar cost averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) (DCA). I was one of them. So I put it to the test. Using the SP500 at-open data (Thank you [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/)), I compared the results of dollar cost averaging vs. lump sum investing.

For every single market day from 2007 to 2019, I compared the performance of a lump sum investment vs. DCA every week for 12 months and looked at the 2-year return from the initial investment date to calculate ROI. I then aggregated the results and came up with a few heuristics to help summarize the findings.

I'm also pretty skeptical of the current market conditions. We're at an All-Time-High (ATH) and I assumed in ATH markets, deferring some of your investments through DCA might yield better results since corrections are more likely in the short-term.

What I found was:

* Lump sum investing yielded better results 68% of the time, and on average returned 4.1% more on your investment than DCA
* Investing in non-ATH markets yielded better results (shocking... /s).
* Surprisingly (still checking the script and data to validate), you had a higher rate of losing 10%+ of your investment through DCA than Lump Sum indicating Lump Sum would be safer which I am still validating because I just don't buy it. I don't think there's anything wrong with the script but triple and quadruple checking to be sure.

&#x200B;

**Next Steps:**

* Validate the output of the script again to triple check results
* Apply statistical significance measures to the analysis to validate the pvalues are in an appropriate range.
* Run the analysis on a bundle of individual stocks where volatility is higher than a broad index to see if that changes anything.
* Run the analysis for periods in the 70s, 80s, 90s to see how things change

&#x200B;

|ATH Flag|All Years|ATH|Not ATH|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Total Inputs|2652|2029|623|
|Lump Win Pct|68.4%|68.4%|68.5%|
|Lump Return Over DCA Pct|4.1%|4.0%|4.3%|
|||||
|Lump Avg. ROI|19.9%|18.1%|25.6%|
|DCA Avg. ROI|15.2%|13.6%|20.4%|

**Methodology:**

The analysis was done using Python in VSCode. Some specifics about the analysis for those interested in the methodology.

* Every market day, I compared investing 100% of the funds vs. investing an equal proportion of those funds every week over 52 weeks.
* I then looked at the market price 2 years into the future for that market to calculate ROI
* If, in 2 years, that day ended up on a weekend I looked for the next Monday
* To determine if market was at an ATH for each investment date, I looked at the max price over the last 60 days and compared that to the max price of the previous 3 years. If the max price of in the last 60 days was >= 95% of the ATH of the previous 3 years, I would flag that day as ""Yes - ATH"". Otherwise it would fall back into the ""No - ATH"" bucket."
2021-06-22 20:50:52,stocks,Crazy to see this the night before my insane house sale funds cleared. I‚Äôm DCAing through an institution or w/e but still.
2021-06-22 21:14:05,stocks,Personal opinion: DCA=Chasing losses.
2021-06-22 22:39:52,stocks,"DCA should work well. Just don‚Äôt take a whole year doing it since values of companies (supposedly) rise over time. I recently dumped $33k lump on clove at $28. Fuckin regretted that lol. Had I dca‚Äôd for 4 weeks my cost average would‚Äôve been in the $12-$15 range. DCA works, just don‚Äôt take too long. Not financial advise of course."
2021-06-22 22:53:22,stocks,"Well logically speaking, of course if you invest early, you get better results. The overall trend of the market is up. When I first learn of dollar cost averaging, I interpreted as more the other way.  Invest your money regularly instead of saving it for one big lump in the future waiting for a dip in the market.  And I think this scenario is much more common than the scenario you are describing.

Most of us aren't going to randomly get a large lump of money. We're going to get a little extra left over after every paycheck that we can invest. The conclusion isn't really DCA vs lump sum. It's whatever can get you in the market sooner.

I'd be curious what your model says if you flip it to account for saving money for a lump sum as opposed to just being lucky enough to get all your money up front. So lets say you got $1k extra each month. Would it be better to invest $1k each month, or would it be better to save it for one big lump sum investment?"
2021-06-22 22:57:45,stocks,Did you consider trade commissions for DCA? It will also impact DCA yield.
2021-06-23 00:43:34,stocks,"Thanks for the analysis.  I'm \*hopefully\* coming into a large lump sum for a sale I'm going to close.  I was literally thinking about this a couple of hours ago - ""If I put it into the market would I DCA over a period of time or just drop it all into SP500"".

I guess this answers my thoughts.  Now just gotta hope I can close the deal!"
2021-06-23 01:53:31,stocks,There is always trade off between risk and reward. You maybe get higher returns 68% of the time but you should take into account that the risk is higher. It is very interesting to know what is the loss ratio when you land on 38% of times where lump sum is a losing strategy
2021-06-23 04:38:25,stocks,I don't like last decade for such calculations. Will the next be the same?
2021-06-23 05:01:10,stocks,"It‚Äôs actually not that surprising that lump sum is low risk since it‚Äôs the higher ROI strategy. Lump summing probably has higher variance, but because it‚Äôs higher ROI there‚Äôs a lower chance of it going wrong. 

I‚Äôm personally in the lump sum camp even though it is less comfortable than DCA.

Doing something like only playing only pocket aces in poker would be a really low variance strategy, but you would go through a lot more downswings than a proper strategy because only play aces is a lower EV (basically ROI) strategy."
2021-06-23 07:50:48,stocks,This test is super flawed. Do 1997-2014.
2021-06-23 09:08:00,stocks,"DCA is being used incorrectly if you're doing it as a vessel for long term investment. It's meant to be a hedge for volatility. Applying DCA on a traditionally non volatile underlying such as SPY is the wrong way to use it. DCA tends to make more sense when applied to trading stocks, not investing on index funds.

Additionally I think people misuse DCA to refer to regular contributions to a portfolio. DCA is a single discrete investment deployed across regular defined time intervals with cash already on hand. You're not DCA'ing if you're putting money in each paycheck."
2021-06-22 23:54:20,stocks,They're *told* DCA is safer. But it's a fail on half of the money whether the price goes up or down.
2021-06-22 21:31:32,stocks,"All this result is showing is that the market on average goes up. If the market on average goes up, then on average it's going to be better to put money in as soon as possible.

You can fiddle with the DCA period however you want, but with enough samples, as long as the market trends up, it's going to be inferior to investing as quickly as possible."
2021-06-23 05:27:08,stocks,His data showed DCA is more likely to result in a 10% or greater loss though. Low volatility doesn‚Äôt mean less risk  if the other strategies ROI is so much higher it negates the risk.
2021-06-22 22:56:14,stocks,Damn. That‚Äôs rough. Had it gone the other way though you would be kicking yourself for not going all in !
2021-06-22 23:02:38,stocks,Most platforms these days have free trades so I just assumed no cost to transact. But you‚Äôre right. They would eat away at your return big time.
2021-06-23 05:12:41,stocks,"No it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúpure gamble‚Äù. The data and fundamental math is clear. 

The stock market has a daily ROI and that number over the course of our lives should be positive, if it‚Äôs not we are all fucked. Every day therefore has a positive expected profit for every dollar you have in the market. The more money you have in the market for more time, the greater your expected profit. The math is pretty simple and the same principles are exactly why professional poker players consistently win. Simply because something has an element of chance doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt a most profitable decision to be made.

If the s&p is going to go up 100% over the next 10 years, then we can calculate your expected return for each and every day in the market and how profitable having money is in the market for any given day. 

Change the numbers around anyway you want, as long as the s&p will yield a lifetime positive return, lump summing will be more profitable on average. Now you can lump sum and still lose out to DCAing, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that lump summing wasn‚Äôt the more profitable choice at the time. 

Now you might say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs ridiculous, how can you say lump sum is better if DCA might yield a better return.‚Äù  The key is you have to look at the expected profit. If you have two lotto tickets, one with a 50% chance to win $100 and one with 1% chance to win $101, you should buy the 50% chance ticket.  The results as to which ticket was actually a winner are irrelevant.the first ticket had an expected profit of $50, and the other one of just over $1."
2021-06-22 23:06:47,stocks,"DCA is more safe if you are withdrawing from it for income. Or at least, leaving near term expenses in cash."
2021-06-22 23:59:23,stocks,Thanks OP! This is some great work you've done. Would really love to take a look at your code once you post it.
2021-06-23 03:35:34,stocks,"That's not necessarily true because the market trends up but on a day to day basis, there's a lot of fluctuation. I could see a point where DCA over a week or two period would beat a lump sum on 1 day, but I don't know how often that would happen to make it worth doing."
2021-06-23 02:50:42,stocks,"68% of the time doesn't mean anything without the magnitude of the losses.

For example would you take this gamble

99% chance to win $1000, 1% chance to lose $100,000,000. Just because one scenario performs better in 99/100 cases doesnt make it a good game.

Moving on from this would you take a 1 time gamble 51% chance to double your money, 49% chance to lose all your money. Mathematically you should... But most people won't, because the money you have is more value to you, than potential gains. 

Hence a small chance to lose 50% of their investment may be large enough risk to outweigh a 68% chance of 4% return for many people."

2021-06-23 08:30:06,stocks,"If you lump sum tomorrow and the market crashed 40% next week, you are in a really bad spot because you have no capital to take advantage of the crash. All your capital is tied up and you have to wait out the recovery on the sidelines, hoping it gets back to ATH. 

If you are DCA that pile of cash, whatever you have in the market already will be down, but you can then dump the remaining cash in nearer the bottom and make huge gains on the way back up. 

Considering a the insane bull run and a lot of stocks up 100% over the last year, it seems sensible that now would be the time where DCA is a good strategy. You can miss some gains, but you won't be locking in huge losses like a lump sum might."

No but having a look at the historical trend of the S&P500, there's ALWAYS big pullback after huge bull runs. This current run has been one of the steepest of all time. 

https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data

And what is driving this growth? Mostly speculation and money printers in a lot of cases. We aren't thriving, we are just coming out of a pandemic which has done huge damage to the global economy, yet we are steaming ahead into all time highs. Seems a bit manic to me. 

It wouldn't be surprising if we saw a big pullback within the next year or two would it? That seems as good a reason as any not to dump your life savings in one go. 

Momentum investing will work until it doesn't. We might be approaching that tipping point. Who knows."

There are many reason why equities may be positively and negatively affected by inflation.

Inflation just means stuff cost more, it doesn't mean you'll make more money to afford it, or that your investments will rise all the same. Look back at the 70s, the primary reason people hated the inflation is because their wage growth didn't come closet to matching it, they just got poorer as costs increased."

2021-06-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Wash sale: does the number of shares I buy back affect the loss I can claim? Hi fellow investors,

I have looked up wash sale rules in different sources but I am still confused by the scenario below.

In my regular account, I

1. bought 1000 shares stock at $2 per share. Total cost $2000
2. sold all 1000 shares at $1 per share for a loss of $1000
3. bought back 400 shares the next day at $1 (wash sale)

If I keep this position unchanged to the next year, how much loss can I claim?

Someone people say I will not be able to claim any loss since the entire cost basis is added to the 400 shares, which equal to buying 400 shares with $2000. This is what I thought was true.

Today I heard that since I only bought 400 shares, I will still be able to claim the loss for the other 600 shares, meaning I will carry 400/600=40% of total loss ($400 in this case) to the next year, and be able to claim 60% of the loss ($600) this year. I was not able to confirm this from anywhere else.

I lost a lot of money this year and would like to carry some of the loss over to the next year, I thought I could buy 1 share each of those stocks that I took losses, then realize them in the next year.

Apparently, if what I heard today was true, then I would not be able to use minimal funds to carry over losses easily.

What about buying options? Say, in step 3, I bought 10 contract of options which equals to 1000 shares and keep them to the next year (ignore theta decay, etc.). Can I carry over 100% of the loss to the next year?

Thank you!"

I think the market (ESPECIALLY the bond market) thinks we‚Äôre heading back to 1-2% inflation soon with rate hikes coming sooner then the fed is letting on, and that is setting things up for a big ol sell off in growth stocks down the road and a pretty unpleasant correction in the near future. 

I don‚Äôt know what the catalyst will be, but there will be some data point in the next month or so that‚Äôs going to be used to snap the bond market back into reality, and I think a lot of really high fliers (DOCU, PYPL, NVDA, MSFT) are going to correct kinda violently. These are all top-tier companies, and I plan on buying all of them at some point, but the macro economic situation is just too upside down for me at the moment.

I‚Äôm just some Reddit dipshit, but you can kind of sense the bewilderment of many smart financial folks on Twitter and TV about the bond market and explosion of growth stocks, while companies that will benefit enormously from higher inflation and massive consumer spending seem to be kind of spinning their wheels or losing value. 

The bond market reaction to Jpow today with the yield retreating again, cemented my view that we‚Äôre heading for‚Ä¶.something.

I‚Äôm not a bear by any means, I think the economy is going to be roaring for the foreseeable future and that tech is an integral part of it, but the timing here makes me very nervous."

Don‚Äôt have kids, don‚Äôt know why. As for Nordstrom they closed during COVID. Before then I saw no indication they were doing badly.

2021-06-22 23:51:12,stocks,"""cash merger event""

That's not normal. It sounds like this wasn't an ordinary dividend and had something to do with an acquisition.

The usual dividend schedues ex-div 2 days before pay-date, to line up with settlement. But there are occasionally weird ones where the ex-div date is some other day, sometimes even weeks after the pay-date, meaning you can get paid the div on the pay-date, and then sell the shares before the ex-div date, and have to pay the div forward to the person you sell the shares to, who may have to do the same if they sell the shares again before the ex-div date.

It looks like RH and others didn't actually read the dividend notice before keying in the ex-div date.

RH owes you the dividend since you sold thinking you'd already earned it, based on their error."

Either way, I figured something was going on because the STAY ticker no longer shows up on ML or robinhood, or it has incomplete info if it does.

2021-06-23 08:07:03,stocks,"2 days now.

The ex-div naturally exists because of settlement. When you sell shares you have two days to deliver the shares. If there is only a pay date and you sell on one of the two days before the pay date you will still have the shares on the pay date, so you will be the one the payment is transmitted to. But you don't own it legally because of the sale, so you (your broker) will have to forward the dividend along with the shares. It's a big hassle that the issuer avoids by saying the shares traded on those days do not have a right to the payment.

But then they can muck it up with the ""record date"" being set before the ex-div date, so brokers are still forwarding payments.

The change in price isn't done by fiat. The market itself decides how to arbitrage the given the fact that the dividend no longer comes to the buyer.

And shares of some securities don't set the ex-div to match settlement. It is up to the issuer, and it can be any time, even weeks before or after the pay date, so in the meantime the people who received the cash are responsible for forwarding it with the shares they sell. It's very rare though, usually only for special dividends that are a large fraction of the company assets. The need to forward cash slows some dividend scalpers."

2021-06-22 20:52:44,stocks,"I about 99% certain that any antitrust against Amazon will fail in the USA. Amazons prime service is tied to value provided by its many businesses. What government cant do is destroy a business in their attempt to split it up and in this case, spinning things off would severely hurt Amazon thus, even if politicians pass something, it will die in the courts. 

What they might be able to do is spin off Cloud since its not really tied to prime or their retail outlet. In this case, it wouldnt hurt investors at all because they will just get shares in the spin off. The funny part is that it might be worth more on its own anyway so there is a chance you will be richer after the spin off...

2021-06-22 21:39:13,stocks,"No problem. A lot of people preach what I just said but very few practice it. Last March I had a pretty decent amount of money on the sidelines. I‚Äôm now up about 49% since the top in February because I kept buying through the crash. I wasn‚Äôt worried about how far it would go down. I just knew that at some point it had to go back up, and that I was getting a much better deal than that I bought at the top. (Speaking of which, I did buy at the top, because I‚Äôm always buying, on a consistent basis.)

I‚Äôm not an index investor like a lot of people here. Regardless of your strategy, trying to time the market is the worst possible thing you can do. The only thing worse than buying at the top is not buying as the market keeps going higher. You can recover from buying at the top easily by continuing to buy at for cheaper prices. You can never recover from leaving money on the sidelines for a long period of time as the market continues a bull run.  

What you also need to be prepared for is protracted bear markets. Most people under 40 years old haven‚Äôt really experienced that yet. It will happen at some point, and that‚Äôs when the wannabe investors will be weeded out from the strong. The key is to not listen to the echo chamber of blinkered voices hollering about the end of the world. They‚Äôre wrong, and have always been wrong, just like the investors during the dotcom bubble we‚Äôre wrong about the new economy in which bear markets were a thing of the past. That‚Äôs the beauty of index investing for those who don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt pick stocks: literally all you have to do is keep buying, and pray that when a crash comes you have even more buying power for whatever reason. If it makes you feel better you could keep 5-10% in dry powder (cash or cash equivalents like treasuries) in case of a correction/crash. But know that the data shows you are likely to lose out because of it, unless you‚Äôre participating in more advanced strategies like cash secured puts. 

Bottom line, come up with a plan and stick to it. That plan may change a bit along the way, but in general it shouldn‚Äôt change drastically. It‚Äôs simple in the end: just keep buying. 

Edit: I should explain why I had a lot of money on the sidelines, Since it goes against what I just said. I had just left a previous job and rolled over my 401(k) to open a Roth IRA. I also haven‚Äôt contributed to my IRA that year. So I was able to dump in my entire 401(k), as well as buying $12,000 worth of stocks in both my Roth IRA and traditional IRA, I backdating the purchase in my Roth IRA to the previous year (which you can do up to a certain date), therefore getting the tax deduction from the traditional IRA and being able to dump money into both. 

So basically I got pretty damn lucky. But what wasn‚Äôt lucky was the unemotional, calculated decision to keep mechanically buying as the market crashed at record pace. Not for one moment did I flinch as the Pirma bears came out calling for the Great depression part two. No one is more wrong, more often than a bear."

2021-06-22 23:34:31,stocks,"Visa.  Benefit from inflation as they take percentage of transaction value.  Benefit from population growth as more people means more transactions, means more fees.  Also, more people means more stores and points of sale--- more fees.  They have little debt default exposure as they are not issuing credit to customers like with American Express, Discover, Synchrony, and big bank credit cards.  

Mastercard would be close behind, but Visa has much better debt-to-equity metrics and has nearly enough cash on hand to pay off the long term debt.  If Square and Paypal and others begin to take over networks, Visa can use their cashflow to buy back stock like mad (akin to Autozone) or buy out firms to repurpose and reposition the company for a new direction."

* Market cap has 10x'd in three months. Fear of chasing gains has me wary of entry at this point.
* The share buyback doesn't appear to be the only trigger (gestures at revenue growth). 
* Unusual to see a profitable company trading at such a small market cap. 

Certainly a good place to focus my energy in coming days, mainly to better understand what's driving the revenue growth and scalability, as well as what to expect in coming months.

>We are modifying the calculation of the statutory two-business day period as described below for these transactions:

>For a transaction pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of issuer equity securities that satisfies the affirmative defense conditions of Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c) where the reporting person does not select the date of execution, the date on which the executing broker, dealer or plan administrator notifies the reporting person of execution of the transaction is deemed the date of execution, so long as the notification date is not later than the third business day following the trade date.

Not sure what the date of execution is in this case, but theoretically it could have been Friday even though the trades were made on Thursday.
