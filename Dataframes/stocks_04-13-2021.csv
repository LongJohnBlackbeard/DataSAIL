2021-04-13 18:57:34,stocks,"$10 to $52 in four months.

down to $34 as of now.

doubling?  that's for amateurs."
2021-04-13 19:12:57,stocks,"A commodity the world is so short on that China is willing to risk annihilation by all its neighbors at once. It's why we're having a chips / components shortage.

For some reason people just think rare earth minerals are ""just magnets"" but even if all they were were just magnets how the hell would we generate electricity and electronics motors of any kind without magnets? And rare earth minerals are magnets plus everything along the bottom row of the periodic chart."
2021-04-13 19:09:23,stocks,"No that's the point, the very ability to manipulate electrons relies on rare earth minerals. How do you even generate power without them? How do you create electromotive force? How do you get pixels to draw energy? I can literally kill someone with a magnet and a coil of wire without even touching them. The ability to convert mass into energy relies on pumping the magnetic field of a coil of conductive metal. And then on the other side it powers a fan by leveraging the 60hz timing like a pendulum and tapping the 60hz push and pull to generate an electro motive force that spins the fan. If it instead is directed into a high impedence material it warms up and creates an oven.

That's all large scale use of rare earth minerals, the same exact thing is happening inside your phone from the accelerometers to the screen.

The accelerometer works just like the fan and the oven works just like the pixels on your screen.

The chip and components shortage is due to the lack of materials. An electronic device isn't based on combustion. It's based on manipulation of electrons."
2021-04-13 19:15:44,stocks,"ok, but im saying the stock doubled in less than a year....it means people are paying attention?!?!? Should the stock have 100x in your opinion?"
2021-04-13 19:36:53,stocks,All AC motors work without any rare earths...magnetism is created by copper electromagnets...
2021-04-13 19:50:29,stocks,"Okay show me a motor in production without fixed magnets? If you could adapt it to a speaker and you'd be a billionaire. Speaker drivers are just axial motors. The need for a magnet is a huge issue. Why hasn't that been solved? Kef just patented a dual core driver system that only needs one fixed magnet. Tell them. I'm sure they'd love to know how to render electro motive force without a fixed magnet.

What you're talking about is the thing that fluxes against the fixed magnet.

A speaker driver is the simplest motor, if you could make a subwoofer without magnets you'd revolutionize audio but also be able to apply it end the need for rare earth minerals.

And then we wouldn't have this chip and components shortage.

Turn a motor. Notice how it has this wobbly resistance? That's the arrangements of magnets in inverted sequence. An electric motor is the same thing as a power generator in reverse.

In fact you can blow up an Amp by pumping the driver in and out manually which generates electricity backward into the Amp.

I guess I'm starting to understand why people don't understand the significance of rare of minerals if there are people who think that somehow we can start the flow of electrons by shear will alone or something...

Even batteries only store power and they do a piss poor job at it."
2021-04-13 19:53:56,stocks,"MOST motors do not use fixed magnets. Examples of motors w/o permanent magnets - any AC powered motor. The one in your air conditioner, blender, can opener, fan, heater motor, garage door opener etc etc"

2021-04-13 18:29:06,stocks,"it's for perspective, usually for those that glibly suggest, ""stonks only go up"" (and in that way, no price is too high for stocks). And it's not **at all** hard to imagine that there are people who got roped along in the 1999-2000 dotcom frenzy, lost a massive chunk of their investments in the ensuing bubble burst (say, 80+%), got extremely upset, and then promptly swore off stocks forever."
2021-04-13 19:45:39,stocks,"It is easy to say ‚Äúaverage down‚Äù when your investment has been losing value for the last 5,7,10 years. It is psychologically very difficult. 

Additionally, not only retirees ran out of money. Unemployment rate amount IT and CS professionals was over 40% right after tech bust. Some other professions were also struggling. And it took a while to recover. And then we got hit by the housing crash. People were way underwater on their mortgages. You are telling me they would be dumping money into a losing stock when their mortgage is upside down and they may have lost a job or haven‚Äôt gotten a raise in years or had to take a pay cut?  

It is all very easy in theory."
2021-04-13 17:49:17,stocks,"If you threw in all of your money at the very top and didn't touch it, it would have taken 14 years to break even. Thats all people are saying with statements like that"

2021-04-13 19:13:04,stocks,"This mean that his initial investment would take 14 years to come back to what it was worth before. Averaging down on your position should be seen a a new investment. If you had put down 100k in QQQ at the top, it would be worth 190k right now. Meanwhile if you would have put down 100k in QQQ in 2002 it would be worth something like 1.2 million today. 

The goal isn't to see your total as green or red on your broker. That said it is very hard to time the market."
2021-04-13 18:27:32,stocks,Part of the problem is that people lose their jobs during the very times when stocks are cheapest. It doesn't matter if the stock market is on sale if you don't have any income
2021-04-13 19:11:55,stocks,"> I was wondering even if someone invested at all time high in  QQQ in 2000, wouldn't they have averaged down in 14 years and therefore recovering as the market recovered?


The lots you purchased in 2000 will be a loss for 14 years. 


The concept of ‚Äúaveraging down‚Äù is just lowering your average cost basis. It doesn‚Äôt make your losses disappear. 


> If what I'm saying makes sense then why do we keep reading such statements?


Because most people are like ‚Äústonks only go up!‚Äù And people say that to convey the idea stocks don‚Äôt always go up and they can in fact go down and can take a while to break even."
2021-04-13 17:49:23,stocks,Well if tomorrow was the top for the next 14 years how would you feel? If you already are close to retirement it‚Äôs pretty much over for you
2021-04-13 18:09:20,stocks,"If all you do is throw some money at a stock ONLY ONCE it is the same as timing the market, regardless of the time you keep it in there.

2021-04-13 17:56:51,stocks,"it means you shouldn't invest a large sum of money lump sum, esp. in something risky like stocks, and not just normal stocks, unprofitable internet stocks"
2021-04-13 18:48:26,stocks,If you had invested into SPY at the top in 2000 it‚Äôd have only just gone green in 2016. That is insane. If you can handle 16 years of red that is some feat.
2021-04-13 19:19:59,stocks,Thay may be true for some people but it doesn't justify statements such as the one stated in the title of the post. There's absolutely no reason you woud only invest at the peak of one of the biggest bubbles in history and never again. Sure you may have been jobless during the dot com crash but if it took u 16 years to find another one then thats on you..
2021-04-13 17:51:01,stocks,"If you start investing tomorrow there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre close to retirement, unless you have a crazy job"
2021-04-13 19:48:16,stocks,"They would have been averaging up their whole life though. 

So if they invested without prior expectation of the DotCom Bubble then they would still have got the retirement that they planned for. 

They just wouldn‚Äôt have got a massively better retirement than they planned for. 

Right?"
2021-04-13 19:05:23,stocks,"The thing is, if you get caught at the top, you shouldn't forget about it, you need to double down and set an amount you want to invest each month. This substantially lowers your average cost basis, and you'd probably break even within 6 years rather than 16"
2021-04-13 19:58:40,stocks,"The average investor only gets a 2.5% annualized return and part of the reason why is because people buy the most stocks at the end of bull runs because that's when everyone has extra cash laying around, and vice versa when the market crashes"
2021-04-13 17:53:31,stocks,I mean that‚Äôs not the point. The statement make complete sense OP is lost with his DCAing argument it doesn‚Äôt makes sense with his initial statement
2021-04-13 19:14:39,stocks,"Man, imagine if you're retired and you have no other money to average down with."
2021-04-13 19:58:38,stocks,this is why you never retire.
2021-04-13 19:20:25,stocks,"Well that would suck, but if you're getting into investing that late in life, it probably isn't worth it anyways. The best time to invest is when you're young. The cumulative rate adds up, even if you don't add to it"
2021-04-13 18:00:34,stocks,"The problem with ETF options is that there are only a select few that are worth buying. In most cases, open interest is low and you will pay a big premium just because liquidity is bad."
2021-04-13 18:00:43,stocks,"You‚Äôre kind of asking the wrong question. Premium you pay prices in the expected volatility of the security so naturally you pay less in absolute dollars but risk adjusted cost is likely the same. 
The question you need to ask is how much leverage is safe for you? 

There is no such thing as a safe be. the stock maybe in the money by the time it expires but the nature of option is you start the game already down a certain percentage points, so you have to crawl out of the hole first. 
If you‚Äôre looking for long term exposure with options then you also need to roll your options forward which means paying additional premium as the options expires."
2021-04-13 17:50:44,stocks,"I'd say so, yes you'd get the advantage of diversification in an ETF vs individual stocks, but that's going to be priced into the options, they people selling the options aren't dumb or looking to lose $"

You reinvest $25 and whatever happens with that happens. 

So you own 50 shares at $.50 which is worth $25.  For that $25 to be worth $75, which would be your break even point, you would need that stock price to increase by a factor of 75/25=3.  It will need to increase to $1.50.

Commissions/share = $0.1/share

$1/share + $0.1/share= Avg cost of $1.10/share

2021-04-13 18:01:47,stocks,I have Charles schwab their ratings are pretty much useless. It‚Äôs worth factoring in like 1% of your analysis but I would look at Morningstar more. It‚Äôs best to do your own analysis and just compare. Amazon is a great company you‚Äôll be fine there with a long ter mentality. Also c doesn‚Äôt mean declining just average return projections.
2021-04-13 17:48:58,stocks,Depends if you believe they will retain the 60% growth they got from covid. Shwab doesn‚Äôt. Personally I don‚Äôt either.

Not at all a sign of a well-functioning company.  

So... Buy a week or so after the ipo when it drops, then sell when it peaks, because at least for now I see issues?

2021-04-13 19:15:35,stocks,"Despite all their faults, it's THE place to go for crypto newbies and a lot of veterans (well vets use Coinbase Pro since it has less fees, and if you're used to trading stock at all then CB Pro is easy to understand). Yes, there's several exchanges that are a lot better, however the best ones lie outside the US and are never going to have a stock (due to the US's regulations on certain coins/decentralization). The ones that possibly could have stocks are much further away from being in a position to do so, so CB is pretty much the only play if you want to be involved in crypto without actually buying any crypto.

All in all I think it's more the ""facebook"" of crypto than the ""myspace"" in terms of longevity. The thing is, nothing has been normal in the crypto world, and I don't expect this to be any different. Many people think it'll tank immediately but I don't think so. The problem is that all the people who don't know anything about crypto will trade CB based on how well the crypto market is doing, which is dumb because CB still makes money even in bear markets.

The biggest thing is that this crypto bull run is much different than it was in 2017/18, because corporations are heavily invested. Last time the bull run was 3 months, we've already hit 4 now. I don't see the huge businesses like Grayscale and Tesla letting the crypto market die anytime soon, and as long as they're buying so are average Joe's, which means CB will be looking good for a while in my opinion.

That being said, I'm going to be watching it like a hawk tomorrow. I hope to get in at the $250-300 level, but if it debuts to the public at the ~$600 it's currently going for in private trades, I don't know."

2021-04-13 18:32:39,stocks,"Time. However long it takes for that to go through, assuming it does, is how long it takes for the shares to reach their full $56 value.

2021-04-13 16:46:50,stocks,"Well VISA is widely used outside of the US, that's why VISA is bigger. Here in Europe I can often pay with Visa but rarely with Mastercard. Sure you can speculate Mastercard will have a breakthrough outside of the US, but to be honest new competition like Apple Pay and Google Pay will probably succeed here.

And regarding Coca Cola I give you some numbers:

-1,63	-5,01	-5,31	-15,36	-9,49	17,59	-11,39

That are the revenue changes each year for Coca Cola from 2014 to 2020.  (calculated the company has now 13B$ less revenue last year than in the year 2014)

What I want to say is for international companies you have to look international. A quick look on Wikipedia what the company does outside the US is often very helpful.

And look at the financial results if you want to hold the stocks long term. A steady decline of revenue over several years can be a bad sign or how much debt the company has. (especially if you want companies that will be around for a long time like you say)

If this is too much for you. Then just buy a world index ETF and you don't have to care about all this stuff."

The rest is speculation derived from these things.

If your analysis includes speculation but it‚Äôs based on evidence you‚Äôre going to do fine. *Everyone* makes their choices based partially on speculation, some more than others. Once you learn the numbers and formulas you‚Äôll do even better.

stocks are priced on their future valuation, not current. for example: amzn's market cap is 6x their revenue (or some number close to that). this implies that amzn will continue to grow at an incredible rate (which they obviously will) but if news breaks out that amzn is unable to grow in the future, their share price will take a massive hit because their future has been damaged"

Anyone who thinks it is going back up *significantly* hasn't looked at the damn graph beyond three months (or more importantly the fundamentals, like debt). But I do agree: ""Fundamentally nothing has changed about the company"" which is the whole problem for the last Xnth years, and why it has and will continue to move sideways.

Yes you did explain the P/E for ADP is better by comparison, but is what they offer also better (more variety of goods, higher volume per good, and/or... Etc. )? Is Hydrogen the main (future demand increasing) factor that, in your dd, sets ADP apart from it's competitors?

Not critisizing. Just interested in finding some points to start my own dd, because I am intruiged! But the share price is steep for a limited budget, so I need to consider buying twice over.

Oh, and good DD! Thx for it."
2021-04-13 16:18:23,stocks,"That's understandable, I don't expect people to buy it, but I have, because I have a lot of reasons to believe they're severly undervalued, by all definitions of the word. Hydrogen is a growing market, and it will continue to grow. Their production of gas cabinets is probably the most interesting for me though. I wish I could get production numbers on it, but apparently they're used in most advanced technologies, solar, etc. They are also acquiring 5 hydrogen plants in the US. To add to that, insiders have bought 116,000 shares, while having only sold 22,000 shares in the past 12 months, despite its 30% rise, suggests that they hold the same belief I do."
2021-04-13 17:35:26,stocks,"Good questions, and yes $APD is Air Products and Chemicals. I would always recommend doing your own DD on any stock. However, I'll try answer your questions as best I can.

I'm more bullish on APD, mainly down to their profit margin. But what sets them apart from the likes of Linde, is that the majority of what they sell right now will benefit over the next few years from a move to clean energy. If I could find out what their production numbers are, I could probably put a decently accurate pricetag on them, but I can't find any info on this. Another reason why I prefer them, over Linde is that I think APD has far more room to grow. When you buy Linde, your investment is split between gas production, engineering and supply chain services. This seems to be killing their net income, and leaves them with less to split between each sector.

Hydrogen is the main focus, but each of the products they produce has an expectancy to grow in demand over the next few years. Like I said, it's hard to set a pricepoint when they there's no production numbers publicly available, but their production of gas cabinets, and the other mentioned products are all very bullish as well."
2021-04-13 16:32:16,stocks,"The DD is good and you keep making it better. It‚Äôs more a question of ‚Äúhave professional analysts and Wall Street investors already figured this out and does the price reflect that?‚Äù Usually with these types of DDs focused on growth people just say ‚Äúthis is the future because of X, Y, and Z.‚Äù You‚Äôve done a really nice job explaining why it‚Äôs actually undervalued as is, not just ‚Äúit will grow.‚Äù I‚Äôll be buying more and watching with interest."
2021-04-13 16:43:42,stocks,"Ya, I've done quite a bit of research into this one, I plan on holding it for the next couple of decades.

2021-04-13 16:51:01,stocks,"Politicians are pretty stupid, so China invading Taiwan just to show that it can challenge the world order wouldn't be surprising. I wouldn't expect it within the next 4-8 years. China does not seek to drag the US in and needs to build a more domestic economy first before it can go after Taiwan. At that point though, it wouldn't be worth going after Taiwan, but they want to resolve the One China issue and believe they can absorb economic damage. It is a really nonsensical issue. Taiwan doesn't seek to invade China or threaten it, so I don't sympathize with the Chinese point.

In a 30 year span, I wouldn't be surprised if Taiwan declares independence, possibly China forces this hand, leading to a Sino-Taiwanese war. War is inevitable, it is an unresolved issue. War early enough could force China to become domestic by urgency and heightened nationalism along with wartime regulation (little to no regulation).

I wouldn't be surprised if all Chinese stocks all get de-listed with furvor in US because China performed drastic action. China's drastic actions would spur US into far more drastic action than ever regardless of UN or IMF or whatever cooperatives that tempers the American response nowadays.

It is a risk for the next 20-30 years and I plan to stay away from Chinese stocks as much as possible. I look at ETFs and see their exposure to the Chinese market and stay away if it is beyond what I would want to risk being exposed to. Again, I wouldn't be surprised if Americans dump Chinese stocks by virtue of support and distaste."

2021-04-13 13:54:53,stocks,"It's a solid idea.  Just figure out the big thematic ideas that are playing out in the macro-economy and invest accordingly.   If you're interested, check out Ray Dalio's All Weather Portfolio idea.  It's for maximum diversification of different asset classes and currency classes that act as non-correlated assets in order to hedge against uncertainty."

2021-04-13 13:52:19,stocks,If you have a day job and doing this on the side ETFS are safer. But if your a degenerate and wanna do day trading buying selling throughout the day when the market is open then individual stocks is where the money is.
2021-04-13 14:07:42,stocks,"Others have covered the basics: lower risk, lower reward with ETFs. But you can also do both.  If you want more exposure to gaming you can get ESPO, like you mentioned, but if you're particularly bullish on Blizzard, you can get some shares of them on top of the ETF."
2021-04-13 14:49:49,stocks,"It doesn‚Äôt hurt to get a little of both but I‚Äôd just be wary of all the new ETFs coming out. The people managing them do take a small fee which is built into the price, these fees vary in size so you‚Äôll have to research each one before making big decisions imo.

Personally I like to take any big gains from individual stocks and put them into some ETFs- usually the big ones, which I originally planned on treating like a bank that I could withdraw from to put back into individual stocks later. I haven‚Äôt done the latter part yet because I would like to have a healthier amount in my ETFs first."

2021-04-13 14:07:16,stocks,This is pretty much my strategy. I like buying into a genre rather then one stock.
2021-04-13 16:22:06,stocks,"Before you invest in an etf, research what stocks comprise it and what percentage of each stock makes up the whole. Some ETFs are overweight on just a few names, which doesn‚Äôt end up helping you avoid the risk of negative news hitting a particular company."

I put my stuff into individual companies i believe will do well because the returns will be so much better. 

All around you are small and mid cap companies about to breakthrough. 

The old vanguard is changing.

2021-04-13 13:58:33,stocks,"Thanks for the advice. So the gist of it is, I'm assuming, index funds are always safer due to the broad reach, but you'd miss out on hitting big on things like the recent TSLA gain. Would you say there's a potential for winning big in some emerging ETFs (like cannabis for example) or would that still most likely be underwhelming compared to hitting big on individual company stocks because of it being a composite ETF?"

2021-04-13 16:47:32,stocks,I don't agree that liking ETFs means you don't belong here. Buying ETFs means researching the companies within those ETFS. You can find a million clean energy ETFs. You still can have fun researching and discussing your findings here.

Cenovus is bringing in around 20 million profit per day at current oil prices.

I truly believe Cenovus will be bringing in more PROFIT than Suncor in the near future because of its refining capabilities.

No. Because now you‚Äôre changing what you‚Äôre saying when the other guy and I called you out on your ignorance. 


> Commercial or residential companies and people pay rent to stay in properties held by $O monthly. 


See but even wrong here. O uses long term net lease agreements, we‚Äôre talking about 10-20 year contracts. 


Now you‚Äôre changing your argument again. You weren‚Äôt talking about residential companies. You said ‚Äúhousing market.‚Äù 


And tell me how that even makes sense. You‚Äôre comparing KO to AAPL. Just because they both sell products doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre the same company or even in the same business. A commercial property company doesn‚Äôt deal with housing, the same way when you buy a house you don‚Äôt go buy a storefront or a strip mall. 


> And $O pays dividends to shareholders based on the amount of income flowing through those positions. 


KO, WFC, and AAPL all pay dividends. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre the same thing or even related. 


> Paint whatever picture you want of me but that alone makes me want to hold my position instead of liquidating the whole thing like some of you think I should.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"A Random Walk Down Wall Street Question A Question 4 /Stocks https://imgur.com/a/5M1brZc

So, if you read the pages I've uploaded, I have a quick question about the advice given in said book.

So, Rule 1. A rational investor should be willing to pay a higher price for a share the larger the rate of dividends and earnings.

Corollary to Rule 1. A rational investor should be willing to pay a higher price for a share the longer an extraordinary growth rate is expected to last.

So taking these two rules into account. He also concluded that High P/E ratios are associated with high expected growth rates. Then we look at the graph and he says ""Suppose you were considering the purchase of a stock with an anticipated 5% growth rate and you knew that, on average, stonks with a 5% growth rate sold, like Merck (in graph), at 13 times earnings. If the stonk you were considering sold at a price-earnings multiple of 20, you might reject the idea of buying the stock in favor of one more reasonably priced in terms of current market norms.""

I don't understand how he came to that conclusion. Wouldn't the 5% stock with a price-earnings multiple of 20 mean it has a high expected growth rate and be a good stock to buy? I just... I got confused when I read this. If someone can explain it to me in a simpler format I'd greatly appreciate it."
2021-04-13 11:53:41,stocks,"I believe it is meant like this: You have some imaginary stock, where you know growth and P/E. With the diagram as a reference you can then determine that the stock is overpriced, because it should either have the P/E of Merck or the growth rate of McDonald's."
2021-04-13 11:41:53,stocks,"The way he worded it is weird and in this post at least it‚Äôs hard to map Rule 1 and its corollary to his conclusion. Basically, this is a math equation and the variable you‚Äôre looking for was already in the equation.

It had a 5% anticipated growth rate. You *already* know the growth rate. It is 5%. Its P/E ratio is already factored in, it‚Äôs just a higher P/E than stocks with similar growth rates. P/E isn‚Äôt the only factor for determining growth rate. 

So this stock has a 5% anticipated growth rate with a higher than average P/E ratio for that rate. Looping back to rule 1, the P/E ratio indicates that the earnings are low for the price. 

That‚Äôs how I interpreted this at least. Does that make sense? The growth rate in the example was already set at 5%."

Hey guys. I'm fairly new to stocks, but I've been learning more and more (with real money and of course only the amount I'm willing to lose).

Recently I've seen many predictions or people pointing out to a possible correction of the market approaching pretty soon.

Once again, I'm new, so I may say a lot of bullshit.

Let's get to the point. I was wondering what kind of commodities (apart from gold and the regulars) usually get high prices at such moments? I was really looking into some soybean etf and other kind of agricultural commodities and I was wondering how these usually perform. Also wondering for other commodities or sectors.

- 1 million shares of Meridian Energy were sold, bringing the total shares held to 60 million
- 400,000 shares of Xinyl Solar were bought
- 800,000 shares of Contact Energy were sold
- 612,000 shares of NEOEN shares were bought
- 16,000,000 shares of Enlight Renewable Energy Ltd were bought
- 1,408,000 shares of Renewable Energy Inc were bought

2021-04-13 11:57:55,stocks,What‚Äôs with ICLN‚Äôs obsession with PLUG?
2021-04-13 11:31:45,stocks,"Thank you for posting this detailed list of ICLN holdings.

Saving this for later."
2021-04-13 14:04:07,stocks,Back to $30 any time soon?
2021-04-13 16:28:51,stocks,"I commented last time, but are we thinking April 16th is the big day for rebalancing? When it drastically increases its holdings?"
2021-04-13 16:44:12,stocks,Xinyl solar is a good stock.
2021-04-13 16:48:01,stocks,"Noticed no TSLA in that mix.  If it did, it would have been up considering the run that TSLA has gone through.  

As such, I'd probably (if I want TSLA exposure) QCLN"
2021-04-13 12:34:04,stocks,"ICLN just tracks the S&P Global Clean Energy index. 

S&P publishes their methodology in creation of the index

https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-thematic-indices.pdf

The explanation starts on page 9"
2021-04-13 16:29:08,stocks,"It's more than 50% down since the highs of jan/feb. Why sell at such a loss? Unless PLUG is going down the drain, I think they are doing the right thing!"
2021-04-13 12:03:42,stocks,"If I had to guess, I'd say they know something we don't. Although there's no doubt that they will be profitable in the next 5 years, the question is why are they buying now? I've seen some rumours going around that the restatement doesn't affect revenue numbers, and with Blackrock having bought 300,000 shares only a week or so ago as well, it makes me more confident that these rumours very well might be correct. I hold 100 shares of PLUG, but I've been selling ITM covered calls and rolling down as they get close to the money, and it's hedged my losses pretty well, but the next few weeks will be very shaky for PLUG"
2021-04-13 11:36:34,stocks,"No problem. I like to keep a track of how it changes for myself anyways, I said I might as well post it here so that others can share their thoughts, or speculate on why changes were made"
2021-04-13 14:16:45,stocks,"Depends on what time you'd consider soon. I think we will break 30 again this year, its just a matter of when I think. Once PLUG clears up its accounting issues, if it turns out there was no big changes from original numbers, it may spark another bull run for clean energy. If not, it'll most likely be slow gains to 30 by EOY. Clean energy isn't going anywhere anytime soon, its definitely a good long term bet."
2021-04-13 16:32:55,stocks,"I'm pretty sure there was an article, but that was the date it mentioned. What I would say is check IShares page for ICLN, they show the holdings. If its dated April 16th and you see a lot more than 30 holdings, its probably been rebalanced, but I'll probably make another post about it if I remember"
2021-04-13 16:46:06,stocks,"It has been doing pretty well. I stay away from it because it's chinese listed, but it was on a pretty bullish run last time I checked"
2021-04-13 13:32:59,stocks,"ICLN is an index fund not an active ETF like the ARK funds. All indices are based on empirical data which means if there's a holding in an index fund, it's not because the fund manager is bullish on the company - it's because it fit the criteria to be included."
2021-04-13 11:37:37,stocks,I'm not a big fan of ETF's but I do own ICLN and am curious to see what exactly they all hold. Thank you for your work.
2021-04-13 16:37:02,stocks,"Thanks! Yeah, i'll check it out as well."
2021-04-13 13:45:09,stocks,"Straight from the Prospectus:

""As investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for thegeneral management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investmentprogram for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund‚Äôs assets. In managingthe Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management
affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund‚Äôsinvestment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategistsand other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplinesand leverages BFA‚Äôs extensive resources.Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered
into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of theFund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred withrespect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution ofportfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses,litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the
Trustees who are not ‚Äúinterested persons‚Äù of the Trust). As of March 31, 2020, for its investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA was paid a
management fee from the Fund corresponding to the Fund‚Äôs allocable portion of anaggregate management fee calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assetsof the following iShares funds: ..., iShares Global Clean Energy ETF,...""

Interpret this as you will, but it seems to me that it is, at the very least, similar to an actively managed fund."
2021-04-13 16:40:44,stocks,It doesn't show rebalancing but [ETFdb](https://etfdb.com/etf/ICLN/) is usually pretty up to date on holdings.
2021-04-13 13:46:28,stocks,"Here's another copy and paste from the ICLN prospectus:

2021-04-13 14:09:48,stocks,"Ah ok, I looked into it more, didn't realise there was an index it followed. There was an article claiming that they would be adding more stocks to reduce volatility though, will this not be happening, or is there a similar S&P index that uses more stocks?"
2021-04-13 17:49:58,stocks,"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/articles/sp-global-clean-energy-index-expands

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"IBM Q1 earnings report... Will the 4/19 report include a measure of IBM-RedHat results seperate from the Kyndryl spinoff? Or will  the report just reflect and be evaluated on the whole of IBM now, including Kyndryl which will spin off in Q4. We need to start evaluating IBM-RedHat on the basis of what it really is. A company without Kyndryl."
2021-04-13 11:22:54,stocks,Afaik it'll include Kyndryl until it's officially spun off.
2021-04-13 14:27:02,stocks,Them and Cisco are getting a complete transition. I think if they want to become the guy again they‚Äôve got a ton ahead of them.
2021-04-13 11:33:54,stocks,OK thanks. But hopefully there will be metrics to evaluate IBMRH w/o the Kyndryl influence. So we can get a clear picture of the leaner IBMRH. And even Kyndryl. Their performance will have interest assuming it goes public. We'll see.
2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"(Temporary) Comeback of Big Tech? The big tech companies seem to be up and running again. Amazon and Apple, for example, have risen again by more than 12% in the past two weeks. Do you think the inflation worries will be forgotten so quickly or is there something else behind it?"
2021-04-13 10:26:48,stocks,"the idea that tech was going anywhere was a joke.

tech is a cornerstone of literally every industry and grows exponentially."
2021-04-13 10:23:13,stocks,"The inflation fear was overblown, now people are starting to realize it and getting back in."
2021-04-13 10:58:54,stocks,"Now just waiting on the smaller, speculative tech to take off (looking at you DM!)"
2021-04-13 10:42:25,stocks,Big tech remain undervalued. Insane not to buy
2021-04-13 11:24:35,stocks,"Nasdaq almost doubles over less than a year. Then drop by a measly 6%. The media: ""Tech is crashing!"" I dont know what they expect, for tech to hit a new high every day? Every other industry sector needs tech. Bio needs tech, logistics needs tech, entertainment needs tech... its the digital age."
2021-04-13 13:34:15,stocks,"We are approaching earnings reports. Buying the rumor. We will see what happens with the news, given the market volatility I‚Äôll probably sell my position (I only have Apple) and rotate elsewhere, like Boeing especially if it keeps dipping."
2021-04-13 10:42:48,stocks,"Tech - particularly big tech - is never a bad investment. Short term things are random - but over the next decade - we‚Äôll see big growth from AAPL, Amazon, MSFT, etc. as tech continues to become a necessity of life."
2021-04-13 13:07:35,stocks,Just recently thinking about converting a big chunk (around  15%) of my Roth into VGT (as of now its just 100% VTI). Dips come and go but it is so integral how we live our lives now for techs to crash and burn and stay down.
2021-04-13 11:00:23,stocks,The fear was overblown or do you mean that there won't be significant inflation in the near future?
2021-04-13 17:22:59,stocks,would be nice
2021-04-13 15:42:41,stocks,Many media sources have been and are still saying to buy megacap tech.
2021-04-13 11:35:11,stocks,"I'm so sick of hearing this. It's a ridiculous argument.

Tech has always been the future, it was also the future in 2000. Look what happened then, stocks just don't go up to infinity."
2021-04-13 14:09:43,stocks,"I‚Äôve said something similar on other threads, and people have told me I was stupid and an idiot to invest in tech; and that the tech sector and XLY, XLC, XLK, is going to stagnate. 

I think I‚Äôve found some intelligent people here at last. Being serious here."
2021-04-13 11:36:39,stocks,Powell repeated 17 times the last two weeks what inflation will look like for the near future and then every time he is about to speak again wall street has a stroke and questions what he‚Äôs gonna say. Not sure how many more times he has to say it but don‚Äôt worry about inflation for now ide say.
2021-04-13 12:08:31,stocks,"The PE ratio of the Nasdaq before the 2000 crash was about 175. Today its what, 28? And way below the S&P500's 40-something. Tech is destined to grow, the question is, is it grossly overvalued? To each his opinion on that, I think 28 is reasonable given the pace of technological progress."
2021-04-13 15:17:46,stocks,I think there‚Äôs a lot of people here who use investing as another word for gambling.
2021-04-13 14:47:05,stocks,"Dude, dont summon him... look what happen monday."
2021-04-13 16:08:50,stocks,He's about to speak tomorrow right?
2021-04-13 13:53:55,stocks,"I actually think the Nasdaq's P/E is 40. If it's 28 it's only that in the Nasdaq-100.

And if earnings play out as anticipated, I don't care about the P/E ratio for SPX because that will be going down. 

Also, the story here with what happened in mid-February to early March is a lot more complex than you're making it out to be. The benchmarks merely had a correction but high growth fun names got taken out back and shot repeatedly. It was one heck of a beating and I think it was so bad that if volume going down hasn't just been retail getting back to work, either that much of a beating scared out retail, blew some of them out, or both.

You only need to be reading the daily threads to realize how problematic that period was, even if you weren't really touched much."
2021-04-13 14:06:55,stocks,"There's no way it's 28, as the poster below stated. It's about 40, which is getting close to double the norm. S&p is in a similar boat.

It's getting forthy, no denying it. Sure we're not at 2000 levels froth, but keep going like we have and it'll get there."
2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"So who's gonna invest in Coinbase tomorrow? I am curious to know who's gonna invest in Coinbase when it DPO's tomorrow? Or at least in the near future. There is a a lot of buzz around this DPO and you can argue it is the biggest DPO of this year(ROBOLOX was pretty big too).

Coinbase is a direct public offering, which means shares trading on an exchange with no previously issued shares and everyone has access to the shares at the same time. This makes it more volatile than an IPO.

Anyways, who's gonna buy Coinbase tomorrow?"
2021-04-13 14:37:25,stocks,"I just whitelisted coinbase and $coin against our crypto rules.

If you had your comments autoremoved, just repost your comment again."
2021-04-13 10:27:46,stocks,"I'll buy long, but I make several questionable decisions."
2021-04-13 13:21:10,stocks,I might. I routinely get burned doing things like that. Why stop now?
2021-04-13 14:01:41,stocks,"Riding the pump, selling at the first sight of a plummet, and then drinking myself into a coma once i lose several thousands in a minute."
2021-04-13 10:12:32,stocks,I‚Äôm waiting 2 weeks
2021-04-13 10:54:36,stocks,"I think I'll wait till the eventual 30% pullback, thank you."
2021-04-13 11:21:17,stocks,"I'm not buying, but I do use their platform and it works well. I feel like any amount of money that I would he willing to buy their stock with would be better spent on the ""product"" that they offer."
2021-04-13 10:18:09,stocks,Honestly not investing in newly added companies currently. Whenever they are added they just get super inflated prices atm
2021-04-13 11:13:28,stocks,It's very tempting but I will be patient and wait a few weeks.
2021-04-13 18:35:06,stocks,Coin base is gonna be the biggest thing the stock market has seen in days
2021-04-13 17:10:04,stocks,"People need to stop banning people mentioning crypto. That is ... kindly put, slow?"
2021-04-13 10:11:11,stocks,"> ROBOLOX was pretty big too, although that was an IPO

RBLX was a DPO as well."
2021-04-13 13:17:57,stocks,Buying at open. Selling at close. Waiting until realistic price discovery. Holding forever
2021-04-13 14:02:53,stocks,"Short term: buy at open price, hope for a quick swing trade in profit. 

Long term: wait 1-5 weeks for a pullback and invest into it."
2021-04-13 11:01:41,stocks,"$35 Share price at a $10b valuation? Sure.

$350 share price at a $100b valuation? Insane.

E: Guys, I'm not trying to set a value on this company, just expressing that I feel they are way overpriced. Seriously, chill the fuck out, I'm a mortician not a financial advisor."
2021-04-13 13:11:07,stocks,"EDIT: Had to re-write this because the bot doesn't like certain currencies being mentioned.


No brainer buy for me. I don't think people fully realize Coinbase makes money when a user buys *and* sells.


Those special coins (avoiding a word) can be rallying or crashing and the middleman is still making a profit. There will be so much movement in that market for the next couple of years, Coinbase are in a good position to make money."
2021-04-13 11:39:15,stocks,"DPOs are super volatile because retail investors freak out and dump at the first sign of it going down. Vonage was a super trendy VOIP provider who IPO‚Äôd, but offered like 30% of its shares to its customers (so they could partake in the rise!). It‚Äôs gone down in history as one of those debacle you only read about."
2021-04-13 11:28:21,stocks,What‚Äôs the ticker?

2021-04-13 12:11:42,stocks,I bought into roblox on the ipo its up $20 a share almost. Ill probally buy a few shares of coin first thing tomorrow and join the pump and dump then buy back when it finds stabillity
2021-04-13 10:35:17,stocks,"Coinbase will dump after retail jumps in. Not financial advice. 

Edit: Not a financial suggestion of any kind"
2021-04-13 12:44:57,stocks,"The real winners are the early stage investors who will be dumping their positions on the open market tomorrow or in the near term to retail investors. There is a reason why rapper Nas will be worth $100 million from his initial investment in Coinbase. Understand that his $100 million comes from someone, and that's going to be you if you fomo in. 

Real money is made from getting in pre-IPO/DPO by accredited investors. That‚Äôs the sad reality of it."

2021-04-13 17:37:59,stocks,Not one regular investor will be able to get in before it rockets just like every other listing.

2021-04-13 13:02:20,stocks,Yep I'm buying a lot of shares tomorrow. Probably selling too after my massive profit
2021-04-13 12:05:46,stocks,No. Going to wait for the hype to die first. Then jump in for long term.
2021-04-13 15:15:38,stocks,only 400-600 a share.....
2021-04-13 10:55:07,stocks,"Wasn‚Äôt roblox a dpo too and started trading like way higher than what it was supposed to trade for?

2021-04-13 12:28:34,stocks,I am. I'm really excited.
2021-04-13 13:39:11,stocks,Personally with tech I wait for first dip. The major players at finance will make fomo buyers with btc money pay a premium.

2021-04-13 10:21:49,stocks,I think ill swing trade the IPO but that's it. Their Q1 earnings are no where near sustainable.
2021-04-13 11:42:15,stocks,"Coinbase earnings are directly tied to the ongoing bullrun; specifically the last few months. It's why they smashed their earnings. Their earnings are going to tank when the bear market winter comes.

Edit: I should disclose that I make my statement as a person who heavily believes in C-currency and its applications with ~40-50% of my investments allocated to that asset."
2021-04-13 13:47:12,stocks,I'm going to be in the sidelines. The price is gonna be insane watching it at open
2021-04-13 13:58:55,stocks,I bet its gonna shoot up and a few weeks later it'll go down.  I'll wait until after the frenzy

2021-04-13 10:32:26,stocks,"I really like the company but like most any IPO/direct listing it seems unbelievably hyped and well above its fair market value. Maybe at a $50 billion valuation, but not $100+"
2021-04-13 10:42:46,stocks,"All I've seen from Coinbase is an insane amount of complaints and issues with their platform. I used it for about a week and the fees were insane. They may be a good option in the short term, but I don't see a company with that poor service ending up going very far. 

I'm a thumbs down for Coinbase."
2021-04-13 10:38:10,stocks,Do we have a price yet?
2021-04-13 12:26:13,stocks,I only know how to do things ape style so I will be buying and holding Coinbase like you‚Äôve never seen before

2021-04-13 12:55:44,stocks,IPO = it's probably overpriced.
2021-04-13 10:25:59,stocks,yup
2021-04-13 11:02:35,stocks,"Only if I can get some shares at open, I know they are gonna fly for the first couple days.

2021-04-13 12:15:23,stocks,Not me. It‚Äôs supposed to be valued at like higher than 100 billion
2021-04-13 13:02:40,stocks,I'll trade it. Invest off an Ipo? Fuck that
2021-04-13 13:12:46,stocks,Have they said what the DPO will be priced at?
2021-04-13 15:26:12,stocks,"Excellent business model and great product but not investable for me at the moment. 

1. valuation is gonna be >$100b. that puts them near the value of $SBUX, $LOW, a bunch of regional banks. At this price, I just don‚Äôt see as much upside as if the market cap were <$50b, for example 

2. Since this is a direct listing, there is no lock period. Insiders can sell just about right away

&#x200B;

Definitely putting on my watchlist, but not too eager to pull the trigger, even though I really do love IPOs."
2021-04-13 14:17:41,stocks,Motley Fool says there are two reasons why it‚Äôs a risky buy.  Here are my two reasons why I‚Äôm buying üñïüñï
2021-04-13 12:57:53,stocks,If Tesla didn‚Äôt literally hold 98% of my money I would definitely go long. They definitely need some competition.
2021-04-13 14:05:46,stocks,"Wait for the drop, then buy."
2021-04-13 14:12:07,stocks,what exchange will it be trading on?
2021-04-13 16:54:34,stocks,"I've been a customer of theirs for the past 5 years or so, I've used their codes to invite my friends and family, and generally have no complaints. Well, except for their outrageous fees. And their terrible customer support. And the fact that they don't support as many coins as others exchanges. 

I also think their share price ($300+ last I saw) is seriously overvalued. I've already started using other exchanges, mostly due to CB's fees and lackluster offerings. And I can foresee something happening like when Robinhood came out with zero commission fees and a lot of the other brokers followed suit. If that happens, then CB's market share drops or they drop their fees and then their shares drop in value. 

Not to mention the fact that if you compare CB with traditional stock brokers or exchanges, they're small potatoes. I don't understand how that $100B valuation was calculated.

I also find it funny and a little ironic that, being one of the larger and more popular/well known exchanges around, they opted for an IPO rather than create a token and do an ICO. I know that those two things aren't the same, but I think it speaks volumes to CB's dedication to crypto. 

I won't be buying at IPO. I probably won't be buying for a long while, if ever. I think that CB has a lot of growing up to do, and I can see it making the same missteps that Robinhood has been making; an inherently ""tech"" company operating in a space that is highly regulated, not interested in new tricks, and needs to work 100% of the time.

And finally, I would much rather use my investment budget to buy what CB is selling, rather than CB itself."
2021-04-13 19:58:40,stocks,"Buy Voyager  digital and BIGG Digital instead of coin. The others are exchanges also and make Lotta money off trades.

Voyager was well under $0.80 back in October  now its $25.

BIGG Digital the same and now 3.75. 

Both have alot more room to run.

Voyager will soon have access to US market. Same thing will happen to BIGG Digital but on a slower time scale."
2021-04-13 11:58:39,stocks,"Folks, I cannot stress staying away enough.   
  
$100 Billion + market cap for something that may not be around in 5 years. Bigger than Barclays, Goldman, Credit Suisse? Irrational."
2021-04-13 12:32:06,stocks,Any idea what time COIN will go public? Will it be first thing in the morning or randomly in the middle of the day?
2021-04-13 13:30:15,stocks,"Feels overhyped/overpriced. It's hard to lift a market cap that big even with a narrower float. Would want to wait for it to settle down before even considering.

Longer term, their position isn't defensible - they were willing to be early and take regulatory risks the brokerages couldn't and are effectively a monopoly for US retail investors, but the brokerages are all getting into this now and will fragment the industry very, very quickly. Remember that they charge 1%+ commissions, which is astronomical. They will get forced down on commissions, and their enormous commissions are how they make the revenue they do. Would not be surprised if their margin goes down 90% or more once competition really hits.

I think they are IPOing now because if they wait, they will not get the same price - because of brokerage competition.  In other words, cynical move to exit onto retail.

Doesn't mean it won't be a good trading op especially with options ahead of possible catalysts and after big moves, but very skeptical as a longer term investment."
2021-04-13 13:49:49,stocks,"They‚Äôre valuing themselves at 2-3x the NYSE and Nasdaq

2021-04-13 13:54:35,stocks,starting price $490 - good luck!
2021-04-13 14:16:09,stocks,"I still don't get why do retail people continue to burn their hard earned money into trash IPO these days. They always go down. Why not just wait it out? 

IPO is not a good will for general public to make money. The big money is made by people who already have stock pre-IPO. Dump right after stock shoots up. It's essentially how these people who have equity and insider people make money. They don't make money from the product but from the IPO itself!

Like another commenter pointed out, the money from growth is already taken out by VCs and private buyers. The people in retail will take on the risk of ""potential growth."

2021-04-13 13:17:47,stocks,The reason I think I will buy in is because of the Direct listing they are gonna start at a not crazy pricing. Everybody will be fighting for shares at pre-ipo pricing rather than institutions getting the low price and driving up before retail can get in... however if it drops at 400 a share idk if it'll be worth it in the long run. Maybe just buy low sell high and wait for it to all fizzle out
2021-04-13 13:19:03,stocks,Youd be dumb too. So many bay area tech companies are overvalued when they ipo and the price will tank and correct in the next few weeks

While they are making it very easy for ordinary people to invest in cryptocurrency, if it takes off in the long run, decentralized exchanges such as uniswap will take over from coinbase.

2021-04-13 16:40:56,stocks,"Not really sure about this, not yet. I'm a long investor for the most part, and for going long here if they're aiming to become the exchange my mom can use, that makes sense but I'm not sure they're there yet. And for advanced users and early adopters (which is where they are now), there are far better options out there. And for betting on crypto and the ecosystem, I'd rather buy crypto itself and either hold or invest.

In the end it depends on the price, and coming from high profile releases such as ABNB and RBLX, I'd rather sit this one out for a bit and wait for the price to stabilize before making a choice. I'll be watching it though."
2021-04-13 16:43:47,stocks,Anyone interested is definitely going to want to at least do a fomo management buy. 5% of your portfolio at whatever price it is when you see it. Then go hard if it falls back 90% or wherever you think it‚Äôll pull back to.
2021-04-13 16:43:53,stocks,It's going to be a wild ride tomorrow.  Nothing the majority of us don't already know.  DCF across the next few volatile months and you will feel good with your position moving forward.

They don't allow you to sell the crypto if you are in Australia. But they still let you buy it...imagine how hard that is...

You can buy...but no sell.

2021-04-13 17:17:52,stocks,How come on TDAmeritrade it's under COIN and its Coinbase Global Inc and the price is $0.0025. Will someone please help me and explain it?

2021-04-13 17:28:55,stocks,$250 a share. Just buy bitcoin for ETH
2021-04-13 17:30:13,stocks,either way its going to get a big boost so if u put in $8 will theoretically make a profit
2021-04-13 17:30:29,stocks,can you link me some more info?
2021-04-13 17:34:05,stocks,Why put any money in Coinbase. The value is in the products.
2021-04-13 17:34:55,stocks,"I'm going in. I have a feeling this is going to be like facebooks ipo. If they were smart...

IPO > add Doge to platform > ride to moon"
2021-04-13 17:35:30,stocks,Throwing 1k at it see what happens
2021-04-13 17:39:03,stocks,"No.

The margins they make are insane. Flat fee of about .05%. Varies depending on a few factors. 

And just like with the brokerages racing each other to the bottom in commissions, same thing will happen with crypto exchanges. 

Coin base may well justify a 100b valuation -now-, but in a year? 3-5 years? Nope! 

Just a matter of how vast it‚Äôs value evaporates."
2021-04-13 17:40:16,stocks,Probably gonna sell it within the day but yeah
2021-04-13 17:41:42,stocks,"I think the better thing to buy would be BTC itself. It‚Äôs way overvalued with little MOAT left as every other platform has started trading Crypto. Also if someone stands up and says, I am not charging for crypto transactions, COIN immediately looses hell lot of revenue and customer base. So I am not buying ... not me."
2021-04-13 17:41:55,stocks,I own zero Bitcoin and am not a fan or Crypto. But the temptation to daytrade coinbase tomorrow is to strong so I'll see if I can't ride the pump.
2021-04-13 17:44:45,stocks,No thank you.
2021-04-13 17:44:56,stocks,Whats the share price at start?
2021-04-13 17:46:56,stocks,I honestly wish I knew how to do that!
2021-04-13 17:47:08,stocks,Thinking coinbase is shorted 1000% might be a short squeeze coming
2021-04-13 17:48:57,stocks,Set aside $650 to get in on it. Crypo of all sorts appears to be going nuts too. I have no explanation why but I like the green.
2021-04-13 17:49:35,stocks,i'll buy some.  maybe $1k worth?
2021-04-13 17:49:57,stocks,"The Trading Fraternity Criteria

If it trades 50% of the float in the first 10 minutes (and holds value/moves up), look at scaling in roughly half at that point, and once it turns the whole float either put your other half in or evaluate your next move. Those points and rough timing work as a great way to just see the supply and demand of the market. I would only purchase as a long term play personally, I feel like long term they will hold a lot of value and are in a unique position to IPO right before this earnings season and with crypto popping off. None of this is a recommendation though, follow your heart"

2021-04-13 18:34:52,stocks,"Doubt anyone (here) is going to get it at the $250 price point. It's bound to rocket from there initially, so probably worth it to pass for now and wait for a pull back.

If you want to go long on $COIN it's probably best to dollar cost average in. Split the sum you want to invest into multiple parts and buy in over time. First batch at DPO and rest on red days."
2021-04-13 18:39:30,stocks,What will the opening price be since it‚Äôs a DPO?
2021-04-13 18:40:09,stocks,F it I will. I dont think IPO price will be the ATH. Im sure there will be a pullback and I will just buy more wheh that happens.

2021-04-13 19:16:09,stocks,I thought about it but may just put a few bucks into BTC and wait for the mad rush to die down. The stock will probably shoot up and then maybe fall. I am thinking about picking it up on the bounce.

 I have calls in PayPal and Square and am doing well in both.

I struggled over whether or not to sell today. I ddn't because I think by the end of the month they both will test new highs.

However, how will the C base direct listing affect these two companies if at all? Wil PayPal and Square be dumped for a more direct c@#$%\^ play?

I'm asking this because a lot of MM's have to reorg, take profits and then redirect those gains into something else... ie sell PYPL and SQ and move those funds into COIN.

Thoughts?"

2021-04-13 19:43:08,stocks,I am rushing to buy IPO ASAP  usually stocks double or triple after they IPO and we can sell that to retail buying high.
2021-04-13 12:08:13,stocks,I‚Äôll wait for the valuation to settle into a channel then I will assess. I think their Q1 numbers will be the best numbers they put up this year. So I think some capitulation will happen once Q2 comes out.
2021-04-13 12:14:21,stocks,"Appears the price is going to be overvalued. If that is the case going to go against it. Open up a PUT position.

I can time the stock market, I can't time crypto to save my life. I sat there and stared at my BTC and ETH and left a small position completely to put it back into overvalued, frothy, but insanely easy US equities. I would have made plenty if I kept it in there, but that includes believe the same hype that I hear from crypto investors every day, which mostly none of it has come true other than their constant predictions the price would increase.

I talk investors in alternatives all day for my job, and people that move serious money into crypto.

* Every week, it's a new hyped altcoin. No one is ever dying to get into the same one. Only the major few coins really matter in investing.

* Every week, ETH will be taken seriously in the innovation it brings. No one really cares and it just tracks BTC. 

* Most people in the most recent rally are just taking their crypto and immediately staking it out for others to trade or use, they aren't actually using it for anything themselves. 

* A lot of invested interest in a complete cycle seemed to feed the beast of just investing into more crypto. It has certainly done well this year, can't deny that, I still haven't seen anything that will make me convinced it should stay other than shutting up my doubts and drinking more Koolaid."

2021-04-13 18:01:04,stocks,"Coinbase, the American cryptocurrency trading giant, has set a reference price for its direct listing at¬†$250 per share. According to the company‚Äôs most recent SEC filing, it has a fully-diluted share count of 261.3 million, giving the company a valuation of $65.3 billion. Using a simple share count of 196,760,122 provided in its most recent S-1/A filing, Coinbase would be worth a slimmer $49.2 billion.
Regardless of which share count is used to calculate the company‚Äôs valuation, it‚Äôs new worth is miles above its final private price set in 2018 when the company¬†was worth $8 billion.
Immediate chatter following the company‚Äôs direct listing reference price was that the price could be low. While Coinbase will not suffer usual venture capital censure if its shares quickly appreciate as it is not selling stock in its flotation, it would still be slightly humorous if its set reference price was merely a reference to an overly conservative estimate of its worth.
Its private backers are in for a bonanza either way. Around four years ago in 2017 Coinbase was worth just $1.6 billion, according to Crunchbase data. For investors in that round, let alone its earlier fundraises, the valuation implied by a $250 per-share price represents a multiple of around 40x from the price that they paid.
The Coinbase direct listing was turbocharged recently when the company provided a¬†first-look at its Q1 2021 performance. As TechCrunch reported at the time, the company‚Äôs recent growth was impressive, with revenue scaling from $585.1 million in Q4 2020, to $1.8 billion in the first three months of this year. The new numbers set an already-hot company‚Äôs public debut on fire.
Place your bets now concerning where Coinbase might open, and how high its value may rise. It‚Äôs going to be quite the show."

The fees are easy money everyone wants in on. Maybe it's the cynic in me but I think if anything, fees will start going up or stay about where they are.

I just ask myself the question ‚Äúwhy now?‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs still not really functional as a currency, in terms of wide acceptance as a medium of exchange. The only thing left in reality is a store of value. I think it‚Äôs being used as a kind of ‚Äútail hedging‚Äù black swan type financial tool. 

I think it‚Äôs well established that the economy is cyclical. A downturn is long overdue, postponed by quantitive easing on a massive scale by the fed and most of that money has evaporated into the Cayman accounts of the 1% amd into the stock market. But all that‚Äôs it‚Äôs done is kick the can down the road and by doing so, turned the can into a wrecking ball. 

I don‚Äôt know where you live but when I look around my city here in Northern Europe, all I see are shops, bars and restaurants closing down left right and center, because they‚Äôve been completely closed due to COVID since October - empty deserted CBD‚Äôs - that‚Äôs never been seen before. The global economy should be in massive trouble, but the markets don‚Äôt seem to think so. Not quite yet anyway. I think that institutional investors are squeezing the very last drops of blood out of the market at the moment before the bloodbath ensues. 

Not financial advice. Crazy theories are my own. Remind me in 12 months.

Edit. Just an aside. It fell in Jan 2021 from a high of 32k to 26k. In terms of said currency, that‚Äôs almost regular volatility.

He has bought over top people from Amazon, Google and chewy add reggie from Nintendo to the mix and you have an amazing team leading this effort.

Increase profitability by closing down locations and pivot to e commerce. All extremely possible with the team Cohen has built. Read articles about roblox and they tell you it could be a millionaire maker, but roblox is just one game, apparently a gaming company with an amazing team leading it doesn't have the same potential as just one game. Both of them have comparable profitability at the moment and only one of them has been part of a media frenzy covering the entire globe. A market cap of $50 billion puts the share price around $550."

I do however agree with your sentiment, it‚Äôs about percentage."
2021-04-13 15:51:37,stocks,I agree. That's why I changed the valuation concurrently. I don't see your issue.
2021-04-13 14:52:47,stocks,"It is, and I know it comes up a lot here, but valuation came right after. I chose to just ignore the bit about share price."
2021-04-13 14:00:28,stocks,"I literally wrote about the valuation. In both examples 31.9 and the 300 dollar one there is a set amount of shares (1M). The valuation you buy in at greatly changes based on the share.......
You just need to share price times 1M in these two scenarios.
What I'm saying is that if the same company get the same money and growth stated, I calculate it's worth roughly 31.9 dollars per share. If nothing changes but the share price, not earnings, not shares outstanding, that means I would be just paying more than what I think it's worth.
Because the share price increasing won't affect much of the fundamentals, there's no reason to change anything but the share price in the valuation.
Share price is the market price, just a simple share price x shares outstanding does the job. And yes I had 1M shares in both 31.9 and 300 dollars.
It's just easier to write than $31,900,000 and $300,000,000.

So if the company is worth $99 per share with 1M shares, that's $99,000,000 market cap, it's simple math to get the return and annual return from $31.9 per share at 1M shares or from $300 per share at 1M shares, to $99 per share at 1M shares.
It take $31.9, thats why it matters.
I know if two identical companies having different amount of shares can have different prices and have the same valuation. I just assume people who read know that and I skip it all together and write the price, altho I wrote both the share price and the shares outstanding in my comment.
And the guy who you replied to stated the valuation too... $35 - $10B, $350 - $100B... that kinda means it's the same amount of shares outstanding."
2021-04-13 14:44:24,stocks,I'm pretty sure that's what it actually opened at. Some people even got in lower than that at around $63.
2021-04-13 15:22:29,stocks,How do you set alerts before it opens? COIN isn‚Äôt showing up on TOS for me

2021-04-13 16:18:10,stocks,"In the context of investing in Coinbase: if institutions can use another on ramp, coinbase would lose revenue/grow slower, and hence an investment would be worth less. Why use coinbase if you can buy crypto through your bank? (Especially for later arrivals to the scene: they already have a bank account, they might not have a coinbase account)."
2021-04-13 13:42:58,stocks,Not holding shares dumbass. The fact there are hundreds of millions of synthetic shares created. Do you understand what that means?? Do you understand the only reasons that a company can have more shares than actually exist??? If you do then you understand they haven‚Äôt covered their shorts. Naked shorting is the only way to create that many synthetic shares.
2021-04-13 13:44:39,stocks,I would love to hear it if you have any facts to state how that can be possible without short interest being well over 100%
2021-04-13 12:41:45,stocks,Eh my average is around 150 a share. Holding 1000 shares of GME. I personally think it‚Äôs a great value play at this point anyways. Cohen will transform this company regardless of a squeeze. But the fact there are hundreds of millions of synthetic shares just shows shorts have not covered. The only way that is possible is through naked shorting and hiding positions in dark pools. Buy/sell ratio of 5/1 everyday yet price is still manipulated down. Shorts haven‚Äôt covered. Retail might own the float 5x over. If GME doesn‚Äôt go bankrupt... which it won‚Äôt. All shorts will ha e to cover eventually...  aka moon is inevitable as long as no one is selling. And guess what?? People are only buying more. If you think there won‚Äôt be a moon give me your reasons. I appreciate any counter DD you can give as to how they can possibly get out of this.
2021-04-13 17:41:48,stocks,What if we made a modcoin to bribe you?

2021-04-13 18:25:08,stocks,But you will have to make way. Crypto is gonna become equally important whether you like it or not.
2021-04-13 16:38:22,stocks,"Roblox is a digital services company with potentially uncapped growth ahead that probably will be relevant on the same business model in 20 years. Gamestop is a physical goods company with residual liabilities in failing stores. They are tilting the physical goods to ecommerce. But everyone agrees the physical goods as a market are declining, and may eventaully become a tiny legacy business like vinyl records or something - perhaps 1/10th or less of the current market size by 2030 or 2035. Even if they pivot ecommerce very successfully, they will need to new business models to survive past that in a meaningful way in the 2030 and on range, unless they decide to just dividend out the money and downsize gracefully, which they may.

Appropriate multiple comes from that growth. For Roblox to have a 100x multiple on future earnings is not crazy if you think they'll consider fast growth. Small increases in expected growth push that multiple up. But that cuts both ways. For GME, even a 6 or 7x multiple on solid earnings a year or two from now is overly generous unless you see clearly a path for profits and growth beyond the declining market.

Put another way, if GME wins say 35% of total physical games sold on ecommerce, and drives strong margin on it, what's the total cash flows they make before the market is over? That's a super home run, and that;s probably 10 or 15 billion dollars, maybe 20. Discounting back to now maybe that's like 10 billion dollars today, less if you include risk. Roblox on the other hand, as a platform with a big creator community, could possibly make a hundred billion dollars by 2035, and the engine to do it is in plain sight, not speculation.

Another example... institutional investors are accumulating roblox at these prices. The only institutions trading GME are doing so on a trade-ahead-of-retail thesis. There are none in it now for a future valuation theory as far as we know. The only people that seem   
 to believe there's high value here are retail GME longs. Not even Ryan Cohen continued to accumulate shares past $20, and he has the right to go to 20% of the outstanding if he wants. It also seems that all or nearly all of the value investors involved, including some who believed in eCommerce transformation, have since dumped their shares. I hear a lot of people talk about the size of the global gaming market - then not mention that most of that is digital platform purchases, and the share increases every year. GME has no strategy to access that, and no clear approach to do so."
2021-04-13 12:54:43,stocks,"From how I see it, if you want to make money on Starlink, buy TSLA puts instead of buying Starlink shares. Starlink is priced into TSLA along with most of the other things in the Elonosphere."

2021-04-13 13:35:05,stocks,lol by the time they even start thinking about putting anything more then dreams into orbit Starlink will have several years of actual service under its belt. Maybe in 10+ years anything will come close to SpaceX / Starlink.

2021-04-13 19:36:32,stocks,"IMO the whole ""not your keys, not your coins"" thing is out of date. In the past when the exchanges (especially bigger ones like Coinbase) were still fairly high risk, it was a reasonable sentiment. But at this point it's the same thing as saying 'it's not your money if it's in the bank.' It's literally the exact same logic. Technically it's correct but realistically it's just a silly thing to say. I get why it's ""safest"" in a cold wallet that you own (even though statistically that's not true AFAIK), but the risk of losing your money on a large exchange these days is pretty damn low.

That being said, I agree that buying it on Robinhood and the like it stupid. If you can't take it out and do what you want with it, it's not ""yours."""

Once this stabilizes again we will know how much was caused by the supply shocks vs true inflation.  Based on the current saving rate and loan payoff data there likely isn‚Äôt any inflation right now.  There needs to be a significant increase in the money supply to consumers.  So far all they have successful done is make the asset bubble bigger.  Most of the money creation has gone to purchase assets.  Go look at the increase in margin in the stock market.  Then realize that number doesn‚Äôt include the shadow banking system.

Applies to Europe and Canada

&#x200B;

* KeyBanc has turned its attention to the videogame sector via some insights in its consumer survey and first look data.
* And  the bank is seeing a further shift into digital downloads vs. physical,  with the figure cresting 50% for the first time in KeyBanc's survey.
* It's also noting a bit of an engagement decrease, though a high percentage of identified gamers are still present in the survey.
* And among sector names, KeyBanc continues to favor Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:**ATVI**),  expecting its franchise strategy will continue to play out through more  of the company's premium franchises. It has a $120 price target,  implying 25% upside in the shares.
* Among other names it's highlighting, KeyBanc thinks Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:**EA**)  makes for an interesting value play, given its well-known sports  franchise and recent acquisitions (including deals to acquire  Codemasters and Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:**GLUU**)). It has a $165 price target, implying 17% upside.
* And Zynga (NASDAQ:**ZNGA**)  is expanding its margins and looking at longer-term growth  opportunities that will also be margin accretive, KeyBanc notes. It also  highlights a busy pipeline, with three near games coming this year. A  $13.50 price target there, implying 26% upside.
* Turning to the concept of subscriptions, KeyBanc takes up the idea of a potential response from PlayStation maker Sony (NYSE:**SONY**)¬†to the strong success of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:**MSFT**) Xbox Game Pass - the offering that recently reached 18M subscribers.
* David Jaffe, Sony veteran and creator of the game *God of War,* says  Sony is readying its answer. ‚Äú*What I can tell you is I know they are  doing some stuff because I know people at Sony who have told me that  they are doing some stuff.* *There will be a response to Game Pass.*‚Äù
* Ultimately, KeyBanc says, subscriptions are a viable way for AAA publishers to monetize their catalogs.
* ""*As  frontline sales trail off for a new release and prices are cut, there's  likely a point where a presence on something like Xbox's Game Pass  makes a lot of sense,*"" the firm's Tyler Parker and Ashley Owens write.
* ""*With  that comes exposure to millions of gamers who may try the game via the  subscription and end up spending within the game via microtransactions.*""  (That may have been a key motivation behind Take-Two Interactive  Software (NASDAQ:**TTWO**) adding Grand Theft Auto V to Game Pass in January.)
* ""*We  don't know the economics of a game being on a subscription, but the  user acquisition, follow-on microtransactions, and potential  follow-through to catalog purchase when/if the game leaves the  subscription likely amplify the opportunity,*"" they say.
* They  don't envision a ""*Netflix of games*"" threatening the frontline $60-$70  releases, though, noting engagement with videogames is very different  from large-screen entertainment, as well as the cost of developing large  games (AAA games easily creep over $100M in development costs).
* So the long tail of a game's catalog monetization is increasingly likely to involve subscriptions, but the *Call of Dutys* and the *GTAs* of the world are unlikely to debut on GamePass, they write.
* Morgan Stanley recently took up the question of whether Microsoft's pursuit of social platform Discord, combined with Game Pass, could help build the ""Netflix of gaming."""
2021-04-13 07:48:45,stocks,"Interesting article. Thank you for posting. 

MSFT is the clear front runner here and if they get Discord they could really shake up the gaming subscriber market. But they are just half of the gaming market; with SONY being the other half. 

SONY really needs to make some significant moves in this space if they want to keep up. The PlayStation obviously holds its own as an entertainment system but they need to keep expanding their PlayStation Network to keep relevant. 

TTWO is a goldmine with the GTA series, and it is still bringing in huge revenue for them. The next installment in the series (GTA VI) will surely bring in about the same as the previous installment ($6B). Just give some more love to your other titles here would ya?

EA needs to reel-in, consolidate or cancel their chaotic and often lackluster EA Play service. If they want to grow, stay relevant and not loose more subscribers. What they did get right and rightfully got a big boost in players for is partnering with XBOX Gamepass. Traditionally EA would just buy other studios with great new releases and bring them under their EA umbrella. This has historically not been popular with the players, as the studios ultimately loose control over the nuances which made them successful in the first place. 

ATVI has a hardcore fan base and many very successful gaming franchises to their name. The aforementioned fan base here are very loyal and not afraid to spend money on the older titles. But what the company really needs to do going forward is remove or restructure their destructive and at times incompetent upper management. Rehashing the slowly fading older titles just seems like a cheap way to make money fast. Ultimately a bad management decision going forward. When what they really should be doing instead is double down on the future and develop the next big RPG game. The talent within the company is immense but needs to be appreciated, listened to and given their own chance to shine. 

Ultimately MSFT and SONY will drive the digital gaming space forwards from here. The major game developing studios need to remove their own individual subscription services from their own rosters. Instead they should partner up and quickly join forces with XBOX‚Äôs GamePass and the PlayStation Network services. This way they can focus on developing more quality titles and in turn moving the sector as a whole forward. The in game monetization will always be there for studio revenue anyway."

In addition to the $65 million in compensatory damages, the award includes $50 million in punitive damages for Walmart‚Äôs willful and malicious conduct.

The news wasn't ""priced in"" before anyone heard about it. The people buying this stock priced in like $500m settlement as a result of the $2bn lawsuit. Actual news came out way lower and stock dropped.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"(KGC) Kinross Gold AGM upcoming - Discussion on voting rights Disclosure: I hold 50 KGC stocks and plan on buying about 50 more.

Hi fellow investors,

This post is intended to try and get some attention from other investors holding KGC and try to pool our resources in assessing the upcoming matters for votes at the AGM planned for the 10th of May 2021. Voting deadline is also the 10th of May 2021.

For those who received the voting ballot the main points are:

1. Election of directors (For/Withhold)
2. Appointment of auditor (For/Withhold)
3. Confirmation of shareholder rights plan (For/Against)
4. Executive compensation (For/Against)

&#x200B;

My main concern is regarding the duration of their current auditor KPMG. Looking back at the annual reports so far it looks like they've been the auditors since the first available one from 2005. I've worked in the audit industry for about 5 years (different industry and continent though so not trying to push my employer, couldn't care less who audits them as long as they have the resources) and from my experience and reading a lot about issues from auditors staying on too long this could lead to some conflict of interest and lack of oversight. From an operational perspective, this often manifests in the form, that since KPMG has been auditing them for 16 years they might not pay as much attention to things that have been already signed-off on in previous years (since they don't want to raise doubt about their previous opinions).

IMO KGCs performance has been good and I'm very satisfied with their management, quality of reporting and financial performance but having 15 years without auditor rotation is a classic red-flag and having a different firm every (at least) 7-10 years is important for providing assurance that there is nothing being missed by the auditor that has been building up over years. This would help me rest easy knowing that two different sets of audit firms come to the same decision on the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements

I think if others agree we can try and bring some attention to this topic and vote in accord.

Looking forward to others thoughts on this!

2021-04-13 11:20:47,stocks,"The process I imagined here would go as follows:

If enough people agree with me on this issue I would draft an open letter to management, the advisors and other investors to circulate. However it would be relevant to identify how many other shareholders agree with this sentiment and how many voting rights they hold. In the end we'll have to convince the large investors of this however I think the demand is fairly sound.

The next largest shareholders according to IB are:

Van Eck Associates (6.14%), BlackRock (5.21%), Renaissance (3.55%), Vanguard (2.92%), Ruffer LLP (2.25%), Boston Partners (1.55%), Fidelity Investment (1.39%, Norges Bank (1.29%), Bank of Nova Scotia (1.24%), RBC Global Asset Management (1.07%)

And the liaison with their proxy advisor is Kingsdale Advisors."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

**Bear Case:**

* [CPI data is out](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) and, as expected, inflation is rising. March saw the fastest rise in inflation since 2012, with all inflation data exceeding all analyst forecasts.
* [J. Powell is talking tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWPt3rUEjVA) on an absolutely awful topic: ""*The Federal Reserve's New Framework and Outcome-Based Forward Guidance.""*

**Bull Case:**

* Everyone knew the CPI data was going to be bad. Based on early futures data, it looks like, if anything, the market's pleasantly surprised it wasn't worse.
* Futures are up enough to put the NASDAQ at a new high for the month when we open.
* The overall narrative of the market is bullish right now, so any short-term hurdles shouldn't affect the long-term bull run

It doesn't look like today's throwing anything at us that we can't handle.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,028** and a **low of 13,850**.

In 2020 it had a revenue of $5b in total, a 284,42% increase in revenue year-over-year. Net-revenue for the year was up 714%. If this was the 80s or 90s before the internet, and an investor looked up the newspaper and found this stock with these great financial reports, they'd invest in it without hesitation considering the great financials, but today in 2021 it's a shit stock that has lost more than 50% of its value compared to its ath and it keeps going lower. Matthew Mchanaegh was right, nobody knows if a stock will go up or down. A company can have everything going for it, and still go down, while another company can have everything going wrong for it, and that company goes up in value.

Trying to plan my post-assignment strategy. I'm considering:

1) Waiting until it falls below $210 again

2) Waiting until it falls below $211

3) Buying after the first significant red day (likely soon after this last week's climb)

4) Buying immediately after I lose my shares

I'm leaning towards 1 or 2. My hypothesis is that this past week is an unsustainable rate of increase. It's up \~15 points since 3/25. That pace would be > 100% annualized return, when it averages 7 to 10%. So, I think the odds of falling back to \~$210 are likely high. However, if this climbs another 15 points by May, I'll be crying myself to sleep.

2021-04-13 13:33:39,stocks,What do you mean? There are already a handful of other crypto platforms.
2021-04-13 14:15:22,stocks,I think part of it is that there's no central exchange like nasdaq or nyse that creates an efficient market or facilitates transactions. When coinbase started I believe they just held like a big inventory of btc and varied the price themselves to try to balance supply and demand. For a new company to start doing that would cost a lot of money and the assets would be very volatile.
2021-04-13 14:27:41,stocks,I say Amazon or Apple. Still havent reach ATH. FB and Google is already up there.

Here is the only thing that will actually do anything to move markets now COVID news wise. If the bad news holds instead of getting digested, everything except tech could be down over a percent, and tech won‚Äôt do great either."
2021-04-13 09:06:58,stocks,"I've run tests on this. It all comes down to how you define ""red day"" and a ""green day"".

If the premarket is green, there's about a 75% chance that the day will be ""green"" -- meaning that we will close higher than we did the day before.

But that does *not* mean that the market will go up after open.

The correlation coefficient between the premarket change and the market change after open is r=0.01, which just means that there's about as little correlation between the premarket and what happens after the market open as there possibly can be."

If you drop the participation by tech you could see a November 10th esque day in the end, but it participating like it did led to cyclicals being dumped right at the open being absorbed after a half hour."

2021-04-13 08:47:30,stocks,Can you link it so I can have a read?
2021-04-13 08:56:05,stocks,Not the inflation data the market had priced in. Should see tech Advance today.
2021-04-13 10:12:47,stocks,Is it NTDOY?
2021-04-13 09:52:54,stocks,It‚Äôs undervalued. Long play. It‚Äôs a good buy right now.
2021-04-13 11:55:34,stocks,Just bought more. Long hold for me
2021-04-13 10:18:08,stocks,">	The selloff in re-opening stocks like DAL is a great buying opportunity. They‚Äôre not going to be impacted by JNJ‚Äôs vaccine IMO.

Agreed. It‚Äôs pretty insane how hard the jnj clotting issue is impacting the market considering the small portion of vaccinations jnj represents. Aren‚Äôt they a single digit percentage of all us covid vaccines?

Think most of these companies will either end the day green today, or recover tomorrow."
2021-04-13 10:52:37,stocks,I have been looking at United for a while now. Still so much down compared to pre-COVId.
2021-04-13 09:51:39,stocks,"It‚Äôs all rotational. I think oil will see a rotation later this year, although I don‚Äôt have a technical reason for it other than the idea that demand will increase dramatically when people start returning to work and going places more around the world."
2021-04-13 10:06:18,stocks,My $ETSY strategy is to hold my shares and watch them gain value for years and years. Why would you exit a company with so developed an ecommerce niche? Etsy is everything you want right now in a tech company. Why would it lose momentum?
2021-04-13 09:44:24,stocks,Get out. Lock in that $200 profit.
2021-04-13 09:48:38,stocks,Contemplating my entry strategy. I am waiting for that drop to jump in.

2021-04-13 11:00:35,stocks,Inflation narative was priced in to much. Tech is adjusting to new expectations
2021-04-13 11:05:39,stocks,"I think most people will blow the FDA pause in the JNJ vaccine way out of proportion, probably it's effect on the business as well. Might be a decent time to buy if it continues to dip and then get a bit of ROI when the FDA announces that a very small subset of the population has increased risk for a very rare, bad side effect."
2021-04-13 12:03:02,stocks,Aren‚Äôt they pretty solidly tied to Bitcoin?
2021-04-13 12:21:24,stocks,"Small short squeeze forming for MSTR, can be a good momentum play assuming BTC continues into coin IPO"

2021-04-13 13:10:04,stocks,The way they trying to monetize space is space tourism for the rich? In my unprofessional opinion it's the least profitable business model. I would steer clear

2021-04-13 16:08:29,stocks,"DIS has a little bit further to fall before it starts going back up.

But it will go back up. It's not like it's a business idea that just isn't going to catch on."

2021-04-13 17:24:29,stocks,Lol imagine not being long on DIS
2021-04-13 18:28:21,stocks,Never bet against the mouse! Confident it will go up again; Disney is a strong long term play
2021-04-13 16:11:33,stocks,Its priced way above its historic p/s and p/e ratios currently.  I think itll take another earnings or two with continued growth to make much of a move.
2021-04-13 16:10:31,stocks,"It's a long term play. I'm holding on to it, and considering buying calls after the Earnings report in May."
2021-04-13 08:13:28,stocks,my casinos are down 4% in a day....so lame. When do they open to full capacity?
2021-04-13 08:13:04,stocks,Two weeks into Q2 and it‚Äôs not a major earnings week relax. hold or buy in where you‚Äôre losing the most unless you don‚Äôt believe your original DD
2021-04-13 09:11:18,stocks,Probably because its up alot recently and its over hyped.
2021-04-13 09:20:17,stocks,"Yeah, Do you think it's a good buy now, or the number 2 cryptocurrency Ethereum?"
2021-04-13 10:55:09,stocks,"Fr I bought ARKK, ARKF, ARKG all at the top and I'm just waiting to break even on those. They're the only red in my portfolio and they're bringing the whole thing down to red."

2021-04-13 18:45:39,stocks,Unless you need the funds why take a loss especially with PLTR.
2021-04-13 19:39:48,stocks,What did your DD tell you about PLTR?  How anyone buys that stock is beyond me.
2021-04-13 15:37:54,stocks,yea there are more buyers than sellers
2021-04-13 15:56:46,stocks,Did u ask this stupid question when we were fully red for 6 weeks üëø
2021-04-13 11:01:31,stocks,"If you're playing a meme stock, you have to play the pump and dump.

Consistently, every time a stock becomes popular on WSB, it gets the exact same kind of trajectory you're seeing with Gamestop. The stock will skyrocket up an absolutely absurd rate and, within days, will crash back down.

The only smart play is to get out while it's high."
2021-04-13 11:02:00,stocks,"Do you mean u bought one share?

If so, just sell it and learn your lesson. Invest in VOO or QQQ and just leave it for 1 year."
2021-04-13 11:00:27,stocks,What‚Äôs your average? GME gave many windows to up to $180 average folks.
2021-04-13 12:22:29,stocks,"It's still a play. People are still shorting it. 

Reading all these dumb WSB comments makes me want to exit, I mean who wants to be on the dumb side of a trade? 

They will probably recall their shares at the deadline (4/20) and the shorts have not covered.  The writeups claim that they are concealing their short interest through borrowed shares and shorting ETF funds that contain GME.

This was always a multi week play. Reevaluate your risk tolerance and exposure. The hedge funds could easily win the battle and see gamespot go bankrupt."
2021-04-13 14:41:16,stocks,"Bruh what, a lot of things are up the last couple weeks. If you are holding shares just zoom out a few months and u should be fine, no need for all that."
2021-04-13 14:40:39,stocks,Going all in on $ROPE is never a good investment in the long run.
2021-04-13 12:12:44,stocks,"Be careful -- that strategy is a bit more complicated than you think. You have to predict the bottom.

If you had bought Boeing shares the day the 737 Max accident happened, you would have seen your shares drop another 78% before they hit the bottom. Today, you would still be down 41%.

If you have bought Kraft-Heinz when they cratered, you'd be up 28% today -- but the market would be up 98% over the same two-year period."
2021-04-13 12:02:42,stocks,The vaccine barely even affects their profits. People are overreacting like crazy.
2021-04-13 14:46:37,stocks,"I still think it's likely, post demo week as bagholders unload their shares and move out.

my original prediction was a slight run up to demo day (5-10% to around 25-26 max), followed by a dip after. looks like I'm right on track."
2021-04-13 07:36:34,stocks,.25% down on S&P futures is red af already? Or are you in stuff like PLUG?
2021-04-13 07:23:40,stocks,"Lots of UK stocks are showing green right now, just in case you want to dive into LSE. 

The ones I've seen are:

- Deliveroo (+ 3.63% - but still super volatile)

- IAG (though I just saw it dropped 1%, but already starting to rebound)

- Babcock International (+ 33.47% at time of typing)

Tbh, it feels like it's a good time to buy into the LSE as a lot of the UK economy is rounding."
2021-04-13 11:12:15,stocks,Best bet is to legally have your parents gift you the money and report that. There‚Äôs no gift tax as you have a $13 million limit before gift tax comes into effect. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor.
2021-04-13 17:06:44,stocks,Two of the four major indices were red you goof

2021-04-13 19:25:19,stocks,Money flowing from small caps to FAANG & passive investor bubble. Way too much bullishness even if inflation is rising higher than expected.
2021-04-13 06:43:58,stocks,I think most retail brokers start premarket at 7 EST

So in short....I would hold until mid-late July"
2021-04-13 11:04:28,stocks,I just posted above the opposite question. I am seriously considering moving more of my non-retirement investment portfolio into AMZN.
2021-04-13 13:17:24,stocks,Tech still holding to its gains. Big tech looks strong once again.

2021-04-13 13:09:18,stocks,"I know even Apple could crash, but it's so hard to picture that happening in any kind of near future. I honestly don't know what it would take to knock them down.

2021-04-13 13:47:07,stocks,Noice. Finally might break even on NET lol

2021-04-13 17:31:46,stocks,I timed it perfectly at 490 somehow. But I only got one lol.
2021-04-13 18:12:09,stocks,Same. Seems like it‚Äôll be a flat response.
2021-04-13 09:10:33,stocks,I can see it.
2021-04-13 15:33:18,stocks,Your take on CPI helped inform my prediction today. Thanks!
2021-04-13 07:36:09,stocks,Bought into AMC at ~$5 and sold at ~$13. Definitely made the right decision to get out when I did.

2021-04-13 08:40:25,stocks,"People were once again expecting runaway inflation numbers and the vaccin pause will reaffirm that we are not out of the woods yet, 

both give another pause to the rate hike story. Should see the 10 year staying tame or even fall down for now. And tech go up.

I could be completely wrong ofc but thats my analysis."
2021-04-13 08:42:42,stocks,"Definitely bullish. People were preparing for the same CPI as PPI. It‚Äôs a little worse than expected, but barely. The result is incorrect pricing and a Green Day for tech."
2021-04-13 13:37:49,stocks,"I guess what I meant was, why is Coinbase such a huge deal when it has so many competitors?"
2021-04-13 14:31:15,stocks,"There was a big dip in apple a few weeks ago and I bought 6 shares, but by now, the stock has already increased by a lot, so it sorta makes me uncomfortable to average up, you know what I mean?

That's a good point. A session is green if it closes above the previous session's close, not necessarily above its own open. A lot of trading apps don't use hollow candlesticks which can cause confusion"

2021-04-13 13:26:22,stocks,"And what does that have to do with us? Real question, if that sounded sarcastic. 

I like Rocket Lab, its a real space company with real functioning rockets with real customers and revenue run by a smart ass dude. They are going to move more into the mid range launches (right now its small rockets) which might be a good space to occupy without bumping directly into SpaceX. It's a better buy than SPCE which is still in test mode, no end in sight, no customers and even then, no real model for profitability."
2021-04-13 11:57:33,stocks,What makes you say that?
2021-04-13 15:46:51,stocks,Do you think share price will go up after earnings? I only ask because I've watched a lot of companies beat earnings and their share price illogically drops after.

2021-04-13 17:53:03,stocks,I like the company but I‚Äôll wait for a pull back on the stock. These ipo‚Äôs have typically not done well short term.
2021-04-13 18:10:17,stocks,"This time is different, etc."
2021-04-13 19:37:18,stocks,That still doesn‚Äôt justify that valuation. Plus the risks are substantial.
2021-04-13 10:44:29,stocks,it's down on the blood clotting news. US called for a stop in its vaccine use
2021-04-13 15:11:47,stocks,voo's up 50% in the last year. theres no way this is organic growth that can last

Which is basically when someone ""attacks"" a website by spamming the server with requests for information faster than they can be filled, and then the people actually trying to use the website can't get the information requests fulfilled. If you were a little guy with a website then literally anyone with a little technical knowledge could take your website offline that way if you didn't have a company like cloudflare to filter that stuff out. But a lot of other stuff to basically make sure the legitimate information requests are getting to the right server and being responded to fast. 

They don't really host your website the way AWS or Azure does, but basically if you use Cloudflare they can keep a small website online, as long as you keep your backend stuff sorted out.

I'd be happy with that, even after sleeping on the greater gains.

There is a lot of pro-NVDA on boards & social media today. It may be good information - maybe $2,500 really is right down the road a piece. Or maybe it's newbies like (possibly) me generating the noise, newbies who got in at $595 with their fingers crossed."

The fact is, there‚Äôs no right answer. If you want to be in this space, you have to learn to make your own valuations and risk assessments and also be okay with losing *when you do,* because that‚Äôs also inevitable. It just depends on how you mitigate that loss and capitalize your gains. 

So, do you think GME is valued correctly? A different way to frame this is, do you think the general investing community, including institutional *and* retail investors, believe it‚Äôs valued correctly? 

You can do fundamental analysis of a company and come to some valuation of the company, and look to see if the stock price reflects that. But that‚Äôs only half the picture. The market is self-fulfilling and delirious almost all the time, so you have to juxtapose that valuation and stock price against what most other people believe, to properly analyze the position.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Did Israel do the study of the Pfizer (PFE) COVID-19 vaccine property? Israel apparently [believes](https://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B21005575-02D4-D4B5-4572-D37D894954E8%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1) that people who received both doses of Pfizer's vaccine are eight times more likely to get infected by the B.1.351 variant.

If the group without the vaccine were not given a placebo at the same time and location as the group that were vaccinated the second time, two explanations could be overlooked:


1. The group without the real vaccine are more careful not to get infected, therefore less likely to get infected.

2. The group that received the real vaccine may have caught the B.1.351 infection at the time and location that second vaccine dose was administered, explains why all eight of them caught the same B.1.351 variant."
2021-04-13 05:25:23,stocks,It's a small study and not (yet) peer reviewed. The market didn't care about the news so I say wait and see if their are further developments.
2021-04-13 06:42:24,stocks,"Israel does not believe that. The study simply showed, again, that the B.1.351 variant is more transmissible, which we knew. The 8 people who tested positive for it were not fully vaccinated. No one in the study who was fully vaccinated (2 shots plus 2 weeks) tested positive for the variant."
2021-04-13 11:19:25,stocks,Saw this study - upon first glance thought it was garbage. They measured getting infected after 1 getting 1 dose. That‚Äôs not an indication of the effectiveness. Makes you wonder what else here is off.
2021-04-13 14:44:49,stocks,"From the study preprint:  ""Our study design was not intended to deduce vaccine effectiveness against either variant, since we observe VOCs conditioned on infection, and do not measure absolute infection rates in the vaccinated or control population. Thus, we can only cautiously speculate on vaccine effectiveness against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains from these dates.""

This was a retrospective analysis of medical records from a single health system in Israel that specifically selected breakthrough (got covid after vaccination) cases and found among breakthrough cases, the B.1.351 variant had more cases in among the vaccinated than the control group. 

The issue is that B.1.351 is a rare strain in Israel, the entire study had 9 cases... 8 in the vaccinated group and 1 in the control group. 

Conclusions drawn from this sampling are spurious at best and not generalizable to overall vaccine effectiveness."
2021-04-13 11:18:46,stocks,"Probably not if I had to make an educated guess. There is a payment dispute between Pfizer and Israel. Israel pulled a classic Israel and wanted the vaccine for free...or the US to pay for them as usual.

I called Fidelity, and they said that even though Fidelity file this information with the IRA, I am still responsible to file this form when doing my taxes.  I'm just just freaken confused.  If Fidelity already file this form with the IRA, then why the hell do I need to file this form?

Sounds like there could be a huge leadership position for Renault and PLUG purely based on market position and production capacity. I find this particularly interesting because F1 is well known to act as R&D for car manufactures and have significant impacts on the future development of commercial vehicle technology.

* If they choose to adopt EV cars, the sport will lose a fair portion of its charm because of the lack of sound and the racing will become worse because of the added weight. They may also run into legal trouble with Formula E.

* If they choose to adopt hydrogen cars, they will both lose road relevancy AND part of its charm, and the sport will probably fade out of existence.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"BABA DD: It was never about a grudge Most of the BABA DD and articles for that matter are shallow and simplistic. Here is the paraphrased narrative you hear over and over again:

>Jack Ma gave a speech where he bashed the centralized banking system in China. The CCP was pissed. So they stopped the ANT Ipo and opened an investigation into Alibaba, and created a draft of anti-monopoly regulations through [SAMR](https://en.nim.ac.cn/node/647). BABA's stock price plummeted. For a time, Ma disappeared and was feared dead. The communists in charge of the PRC don't tolerate free speech like Jack Ma's and they're teaching him - and others - a lesson. While he came-out alive, this has still all been a flex by the PRC on one guy.

This is reductive, simplistic, and a mildly [sinophobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Chinese_sentiment).  I know; this is an investment sub, why tf are we talking about social justice shit? We're not. We're talking about blinders that can make you make bad investment decisions. If you look back a few months from now and realize part of your assumption about Chinese stocks is that the PRC is fundamentally irrational and anti-competitive because they love commie-ism so much and aren't as intelligent as their American counterparts...maybe its time to reflect on that shit and/or stick to stocks where your cable news geopolitics don't cloud your judgement.  

But I digress.

The series of anti-monopoly actions taken by SAMR since November have nothing to do with Jack Ma's speech. In fact, the cause and effect are backwards on that one - Ma heard a leak about the SAMR regulations that were coming and got all heated about it and gave that speech anyway. The regs caused the speech, the speech didn't cause the regs. Ma probably should've called-in sick and got drunk in his penthouse instead, mighta saved him some money but he's clearly a sassy lil fucker.

Alibaba has $1.3 trillion in assets and less than half of that in debt. They have 1 billion subscribers but lots of room to grow with a newly-formed world's biggest trade block in the pacific. They've been under 20 p/e for the last few months but rival amazon in size, scope, and product diversification. 

Did you think that the CCP was bad enough at judgement to blow it up because a little dude with a funny shaped head said some words they didn't like? I mean, don't you *have* to assume the CCP is pretty stupid to think that was going to happen? 

Economically, competitively, geopolitically - Alibaba's existence and *strength* is good for the PRC under almost any condition. Unless it fucks-up a trade deal, lets the US run roughshod over them in years of trade litigation, or is an actual debt time bomb. All of those things were at risk in November which is the true cause of the crackdown.

The 3 primary catalysts for the SAMR regs, ANT delay, and BABA investigation were:

1. Completion of the [RCEP](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/juoce8/rcep/). (Link is to a post from 4 months ago when it passed)
2. Winning trade-war litigation v. the US via WTO [dispute settlement](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_e.htm). (Remember most of this began days after Biden had won the election: thus, PRC knew that de-escalating the trade war and needing to defend trade law more meticulously would be a reality in a new administration).
3. ANT was printing loans and flipping them before they had time to count the money. It was a credit liquidity WMD and it needed to be corrected.

Quick DD on each catalyst that I should probably cite more but I'm not going to because I'm drunk and want to play video games soon:

# Completion of RCEP:  

Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is the largest trading block in the world, basically the includes the whole western pacific/SE asia region. China was making it a point to get this done before Biden got into office and could begin using soft power to repair alliances/partnerships throughout the pacific. Mango fucked-up a lot of US relations throughout the region and China didn't fuck around filling-in the void. RCEP also has conditional inclusion requirements for Australia and India, basically an offer neither can refuse but would naturally make them less dependent on the US for foreign investment. For the PRC, that's a smart fucking play and a shitburger for biden to eat. (See, this is how actual Machiavellian realpolitik shit allows one to make causal connections outside of ""Jack Ma said bad words CCP don't like, duh."") 

One of the many complexities of negotiating trade agreements is making sure all signatory countries' regulations on markets are fairly similar.

[I predicted months](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmhx7d/forget_the_jack_ma_grudge_thing/) ago that BABA would gladly drop the ""pick 1 of 2"" rule as a part of the anti-monopoly stuff, get slapped on the wrist and that'd be about it. ANT would have to be a real bank too (that's below). I'm not fucking nostradamous, the rule just wouldn't make sense under RCEP.

1 of 2 makes a merchant pick **ONE** platform exclusively for distribution. The RCEP makes e-commerce, auto sales, everything equivalent in every members state. You can sell a blender with Indonesian and Chinese parts in Thailand without having to pay a differential tax/tariff/etc.

So with 1-of-2 *and* RCEP in place, Alibaba as a company would force companies in Indonesia NOT to use Sea Limited products? Why the fuck would that make sense? And what country in their right fucking mind would sign a trade agreement like that? Of course they had to drop that shit, it was an anti-competitive incubator law for Baba and other tech behemoths to grow. It worked, they're ready. Don't need the incubator any more. A couple weeks after the SAMR started huffing and puffing, the RCEP was done.

# TRADE WAR DE-ESCALATION:

The previous administration levied a lot of tariffs to initiate a trade war with China. They did tariffs back (called countervailing duties). This is why countries don't do trade wars that much, its a [shitty](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/08/07/more-pain-than-gain-how-the-us-china-trade-war-hurt-america/) outcome for everyone every time.

So basically Biden has to clean-up a big fucking no-win food fight that's been going on for years. Not biden himself, [this guy](https://ustr.gov/about-us/biographies-key-officials/juan-millan-austr) and a platoon of trade lawyer nerds. The problem is that the US used some fucking stupid excuses for levying tariffs, specifically the national security defense of steel/aluminum (spoiler alert: there aren't many ways the US could lose a war but running out of steel is NOT one of them), which are going to be hard to excuse in arbitration. And the trade rep from the PRC isn't going to give a fuk that there's a new US president: the US did what the US did. China can use the justification of ""national security"" for shielding itself from amazon/google etc. while sheltering the development of its tech behemoths through RCEP.

Arbitration through the WTO makes *theatrical self-regulation lucrative* for a country but destroying giant companies isn't. Every big free trade agreement is preceded by participants ""cleaning up their act"" (and not). It pays to bark at one's tech giants but not to bite. So the PRC needed to create the impression of due diligence, if not *over* diligence, to create legal fodder for their attorneys to de-escalate the trade war advantageously.

Plus there is a lot of synergy between RCEP and trade war de-escalation.

An important component for any attack on PRC trade policies for USTR will be that the RCEP is anti-competitive because it is exclusive. Those criticisms are hard to make when its a done deal. If the US wanted in, they should've have pushed for that before the deal's completion. China knew that mango couldn't see the chess game so there was no harm or hindrance to closing the deal ASAP after the US election was conclusive.

# ANT time bomb

Should cite. Won't cite. But ANT was writing loans like it was nothing and then flipping them by the millions to whatever venders for whatever price. ANT had no liability and was writing billions in loans. So there was actual credit market concern if the IPO wasn't held-up. SAMR is going to make them be a legit bank that needs backing for what they're writing.

Dropping the 1 of 2 thing and the slap-on-the-wrist fine is the 2nd to last thing.

Last thing will be SAMR giving an explicit green light (and maybe a date) to the Ant IPO. I'd say that will happen soon but I've been thinking that for months.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

China was never going to blow-up baba or ANT. They need to do a pose to complete RCEP and 'win' the trade war de-escalation with the US.

2021-04-13 09:36:54,stocks,"I agree that the trade war with China is mostly stupid.  Blaming the loss of jobs in middle America on trade deals is one of the most mentally dishonest political tricks that politicians play on the public.  Those jobs were going away whether it was China, Mexico, Canada or even just some good old American made robots that were going to destroy them.  A tariff on China ain‚Äôt bringing those jobs back despite what the media tells you.  

When your job is high paying, easily automated, and easily reproduced by low skilled labor somewhere else...sorry people it‚Äôs probably not going to last long.  A job is not an eternal commitment to your personal welfare.  People don‚Äôt like to hear this.

But to blame media coverage on ‚Äúsinophobia‚Äù is to completely misrepresent what‚Äôs going on.  Americans don‚Äôt fear the Chinese like they did the Soviets or the Germans in days of yore.  In fact I think Americans are actually pretty positively predisposed to the Chinese people.  The idea that Americans secretly hate or fear them is a concept that is being made up on reddit before our very eyes.

Other than that fact I mostly agree that the media narrative around this is oversimplified for consumption by western media.  Just not out of sinophobia."

2021-04-13 01:31:53,stocks,Buffett‚Äôs homie Charlie Munger went as far as to make BABA 19% of his stock portfolio during all of this. The dinosaurs out there still got some moves
2021-04-13 03:23:18,stocks,"I think a good question to ask over the last 6 months is this:

If BABA is priced at $250, is that too much? Why? Aside from market uncertainty related to this grudge thing. The price jumped by like $20 when Jack Ma was spotted golfing/alive. There's no bear case except the CCP regulatory boogeyman. If that passes, what's Chinese Amazon worth now that it can sell ALL of its products in about 11 new countries because of rcep?"
2021-04-13 10:42:30,stocks,"Thank you! Yeah, part I forgot to emphasize is despite the regulations that go with it, RCEP is crazy bullish for BABA."

2021-04-13 09:45:22,stocks,"That why Asian folks are being attacked and murdered at record rates?

Sino ""phobic"" is perhaps the wrong word as much of what I've described has little to do with fear tropes. But anti-asian bias is a real thing and def makes news networks more prone to accept shallow answers like ""Jack Ma made them mad so they've forgotten geopolitics and are swinging wilding at all internet businesses with regulation"". You have to assume incompetence/stupidity to be contented with dots being connected like that.
Also, not to open another can of worms, but ""Americans don't fear the Chinese like the soviet"" is a hasty generalization made with zero evidence. Many of the public examples including hate crimes and mass murders would seemingly dispute the fact that sinophobia just isn't a thing.

IN hindsight, not sure my level of snark was appropriate given your edit. All the same, I think its worth noting that there were legitimately people on these subs saying the PRC was going Nationalize BABA. And its weird to me that someone that ignorant would continue to be adamant and potentially lose money because of it."

I dunno man. Why this moral stance on China for their fucked up genocide but we can ignore the US actively still bombing the middle east? Children die, innocent civilians die.

Imagine if China bombed a country in the middle east tomorrow? Everyone would freak out and say its WW3 blablabla.

Your argument about whether its worse than the times of Japanese internment (for example) is inconsequential and ironically not supported by data; there's documental sinophobic racism that is causing more violence today that is statistically abnormal. If shit was worse in the times of Korematsu, that doesn't make current anti-asian violence acceptable or good by comparison. 

With multiple news outlets saying shit like ""china flu"" every day and both political parties being willing to china bash when its useful to garner votes, its not hard to start connecting dots.

Geopolitics, trade, and economics are complicated and nuanced. News agencies focused on entertainment don't have time for that shit so they often pitch the simpler to digest narrative; the Chinese love communism SOOO MUUCH, they are going to blow-up a giant company because they're irrational.

> It was a trade dispute that could have derailed Volkswagen Group's best laid plans to unseat Tesla as the world‚Äôs dominant electric-vehicle manufacturer, and it went down to the wire. But the two rival Korean electric-battery makers struck a last-minute deal, putting the German carmaker back on track to ramp up production in the U.S.

If left unresolved, a U.S.-government imposed import ban levied against SKI could have posed a ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù disruption to the German automaker‚Äôs U.S. electric-vehicle operations. Production at Ford Motor would also have been affected.

Tesla got it right for me. Whenever I see a Tesla I have that instant ‚Äûwow-effect‚Äú. It makes me wanna buy one so bad. That is something Tesla has in common with Apple. Dont get me wrong. VW builds good cars. Its just that they are not ‚ÄûThe peoples car‚Äú of our generation.

Now I am left with about 20%, I have bought some good stocks which are currently on the low and looking to recoup my losses in a few months. Now I see a good stock that I know has a good upside, it went up 200% yesterday and I didn't even buy knowing that I am invested in other potential reverse merger plays that I am bullish about.

I personally like to only pick things that Wallstreet dislikes temporarily. Ex. Exxon at $33 in October, Ulta after the big crash in 2019, etc.

These are great companies that had huge drops. Unless there is fraud, a depression, or the end of civilization, these giant money printing companies arent suddenly worth a fraction of their value. These sudden drops in stock price are always something to check out.

Capitalize on emotions. When you are logical when others are emotional, you come out ahead when emotion subsides. BABA is my latest play, and Im hoping it pans out as well, though China is always a risky move.

Basically, I recommend doing the opposite of FOMO. Dont pick GME, BB or other turd companies that are barely staying afloat though. Pick great companies at the top of their industry that have sudden drops for no good reason."

If you're trying to recoup your money, I would just invest in more proven companies like AAPL, MSFT, etc. and ride it out a bit.

Then 'Crappy Car Company' and their friends shit on this new competitor and spread false news etc. (not based on reality), so the stock market investors loses confidence in the stock and 'Awesome Autos' stock crash to say 20 bucks.

Learn to stop listening to what they tell you, and start paying attention to the data yourself, it's the only way you will be able to see things objectively.

2021-04-13 08:29:17,stocks,"Like all news, there is a lot of bullshit clickbait out there. There is also some legitimate and interesting financial news, though to be honest it usually isn't free.

But people tend to have this fundamental misconception about financial news that it should be able to predict the future or fully ""explain"" markets. Same with those analyst reports that the investment banks crank out. No one can do that and it's not even what news outlets are trying to do. All the news can do is report on facts (which may or may not be current by the time you read them) that, if you wish, you can take into account in formulating your own explanations and predictions. Anyone who expects more than that of financial news is the fool.

Headlines of the form ""Stocks go [up/down] as [something else happens]"" are, at best, intended as a quick-and-dirty round-up of what is going on right now that market participants are likely to care about. (At worst, they are shameless clickbait.) Reputed news outlets will report these kinds of headlines, but they will not usually report on a causal link between them - that is left as an exercise to the reader. For example, the FT reports ""Equities rally pauses ahead of US earnings season"". That is simply stating a fact (equities rally pauses) and some context (US earnings season looming). It's not trying to predict anything or make any fundamental statement as to what drives asset prices. And of course it's entirely possible that in the two hours between the headline being published and you reading it, equities have collapsed or gone to the moon.

And of course there's a ton of other financial news that doesn't take that format at all; stories about planned IPOs, acquisitions, litigation, tax changes, regulation changes, etc. Which is less attention-grabbing but probably a lot more interesting and useful.

So basically:

- Read actual financial news, and not clickbait.
- Remember that (real) journalists are in the business of reporting facts, not predictions or financial models."

Before 24 hour cable news cycle started in the 80‚Äôs, we had 3 channels (maaaaybe 4) and  ‚ÄúThe News‚Äù was 1/2 hour of local coverage and 1 hour of national that‚Äôs it.  No 24 hours of news on dozens of channels, no social media links to horseshit, no blog anything, no algorithms meditating every second of every day on what makes you tick and how to most efficiently force feed you bullshit through all of your smart(ass) devices.  In other words, there was less air time for bullshit because with so much less content, it was possible for the media to fact check.  That all changed in the late 90‚Äôs when the domestic internet showed up to the party and unceremoniously stuck its dick in the mashed potatoes.  Traditional media had to swap quality for quantity almost overnight in order to compete.  Smart phones come out a few years later and suddenly we‚Äôre ALL in truck stop bathroom crushing up crazy pills on the shitpot tank. 

If the increased quantity of media horseshit was facilitated by the advancement of technology, we should look to the same source for a solution.

2021-04-13 05:37:41,stocks,"There are news and then there are news. CNBC, Yahoo Finance care about eyeballs because of ad-revenue so they go with simple, digestible stories that are not anything in dept but grab your attention. That's fine and everyone knows it and maybe if you didn't know it then you feel like you are taking crazy pills but there's nothing crazy about it. There are real news if you are looking for it but they are either paid platforms or something that you will have to spend more than 5 minutes reading. And these are not things you typically find on Reddit either.

Now on TA I'm sorry but I have to be honest. Cocky Reddit investors who think they know better than anyone else always say TA is such a joke, its stupid, its horoscope, blah, blah. You don't understand TA and you don't know how to use it. That's fine, I'm the same but that doesn't mean that TA is stupid just because you cannot understand it. I don't know to to play violin but that doesn't make violins stupid. Listen, I've seen interviews with many many very accomplished people in the financial industry. They are super smart people and way smarter than me or anyone on this thread probably. Not one of them said that TA is stupid and many of them actually use it. So then you have to think, are Redditors who started investing since March smarter than Stanley Druckenmiller and people like him. I know where I place my bet."
2021-04-13 05:42:14,stocks,I mean I watch halftime report on CNBC but never make trades based on what they're saying. It's just funny to see Josh Brown clown people every now and then. FT is pretty great but you gotta be prepared to pay.

The best analysis that's published is simply someone's opinion on what is essentially a super- organism; sometimes you can predict it with accuracy, and sometimes not.

Personally, I attribute this to the democratization of the investment world through brokerage apps. More people than ever before are taking an interest, and taking part in, with the stock market. Practical effects of this, is that the effects of the stock market tend to be exaggerated, difficult to predict."

2021-04-13 11:34:01,stocks,"There is hyperbole journalism in every segment, and your example seems in line with that for financials.

But good financial news is tradeable.   in that category is press releases, announcements, and straight up ""this just happened"" news items (when you know what to look for)

Big wall street firms have analysts covering stocks and sectors to dice and slice news details and tell the traders what is impactful.  I dont mean the public ""Goldman is positive on AMZN""... I mean internal analysts who just churn the the news, earnings releases, everything... and share to internal users.

""Powell says..."" is diced into: ""Ok traders here is what stocks we see are impacted by that""

Trump's tweets made the internal news teams crazy and important.  in 160 chars he could put out some decision or statement that would get reviewed as ""these companies will be impacted by his plans""

And all the core news services can be bought by trading firms.  Pumped into the trading floor and algo servers faster than any news outlet can push out to the public.

Bloomberg, Dow Jones, twitter.. all of them..

Before the news is even seen by the public, the algo has already parsed the headline and made basic decisions, an internal analyst has reviewed and pushed actionable impacts to traders, and traders are making their moves with click trading or algo param changes.

Minutes later the public sees it.   But millions have already been made or saved"

But the fact remains that its up to the trader to act on those assumptions from the Financial News they read BACKED by their own research of the stocks/strategies they plan to act on. Just because you saw some financial news doesn't mean the outcome affects you and should always be taken in with marginal uncertainty.

overall, the longer I monitor markets, the more I read about MM¬¥s and what power they wield, I tend to believe they do not react at all. they act and the markets react. 

what I mean: 

if 1000 retail investors decide to buy a stock, it rarely moves. if two market makers with several billion decide to buy into anything, it not only moves the stock by itself, it also offers signals to the whole rest of the market. 

and to have this much power you do not need to be a market maker. simply look at how people gobble up trade info about ARK, BRK, or every tweet by Mr. Musk.

2021-04-13 09:55:50,stocks,"I'm not an analyst but really maybe you ought to think about this more if you really want to know because obviously you haven't.

In  any case, I think you are quite irritated because your expectations are  completely unrealistic. No one can consistently and accurately predict  price movements. However, do you seriously not see how childish you look  when your reaction is, oh you can't see the future so you voice is  meaningless even if you spend weeks on making your notes. I mean that's  why I didn't even want to reply seriously, this is such fucking basic  thinking that you just can't take it seriously. 

On  second thought, maybe you are irritated because you take analysts'  recommendations literally? Maybe when you see sell recommendation you  literally sell? I can see why you would be angry if you did that.  Listen, the bottom line is that there are many very smart analysts who  know their field very well. And they really are much smarter than you or  me. I read their notes because they often times talk about some deep  industry insights that I, as a layman, don't know about and they  sometimes bring industry or equity specific things to my attention that  I'm totally unaware of and that I'm very happy to learn. Does it mean  that I always act on their recommendation? Absolutely no. Does it mean  that they always get it right? Of course no, nobody can. Does it mean  that because they can't always get it right they are stupid morons? No  and if that was your view you should really do some deep thinking. But  the notion that every financial analyst is a hack or a fucking moron and  they are not ever worth listening to, I mean if you honestly think that  then you are \[can't say\]. Sorry to say that but it's just how it is.

This  is such a stupid argument I cant get over it. Like, what are you doing  here shitposting on Reddit if you are much smarter than any analyst.  Just win this game or get employed by GS and collect that easy money. Or  what about Warren Buffet. He was so hyped up about buying Kraft Heinz  and how he predicted it will do so great because of brand loyalty and it  turned into pile of shit. Is he also a moron not worth listening to? I  mean he predicted that wrong. Also, you get notes from people who know  industry, who have access to resources that we don't have access to and  who have to do this as a day job. So you get a note and you go like no, not gonna pay any attention, you are a hack and I'm too smart for it. I  can't get over people are actually thinking like that. How the fuck do  you guys make any money investing with this mindset???"

It boils down to this: No one *needs* to predict price movements perfectly, *every time*, to make money.

In fact, you don't even have to be right **half the time** if the confidence in the prediction is good enough.

It's called asymetric bets. Look it up. You only need 3 or 4 Ten baggers in your life to be set. A one Peter Lynch said that. You know what else he said? ""You dont need to know every part of the market to be successful, just pick the niche that you know, and leverage your insider knowledge."" Analysts dont even do that! 

Your Buffett&Kraft example is perfect: he put his money where his mouth is, and always has, and he has been rewarded for it. Not in that case, but in Life. Because what he says actually has merit, most of the time, and he also believes in it, and is willing to put money on it!

#If someone doesn't even believe enough in their own prediction to act on it themselves, it is worth exactly as much as they are investing: ZERO!


What am I doing shitposting on reddit? I make money doing what I'm doing. And if I invest in a stock, then it's because I did the research and made the decision. Not because an analyst with clearly a different agenda than to make me money is saying it.


So what does that say about your rant? Your are using so many fallacies to make the point that it isnt even worth listing them. strawman and goalpost  are just the tip of the iceberg.

This is what I got banned for:

The volume of trading since the original short positions were squeezed has been probably 100x what would be needed for them to have gotten out.

Any agency, whos business model is to analyze SI, tells you it's ~20%. I trust them more than I trust some idiot on the internet and what the original short squeeze was based on was their data.

The borrow rate is basically free https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME  No one is letting you borrow at those rates if there is share shortage issues. For reference, It was above 80% in January. The hedgies are not bleeding

You might get some gamma squeezes because the option chain is pretty borked but maybe not, really depends if the MMs have sorted their shit out on this.

My own common sense tells me that if these tools were accurate, at lot of people would be a lot richer than they are right now.

What if you set up a paper trade where you bought stock only based on one of these tools? Buy the stock when Tradingview's needle says buy, diligently sell when it says sell. Do the same for all the other sites.

Something tells me the answer is ""you'd lose a ton of money, those indicators are only meant to aide your decision, not rely 100% on them!"" and that's probably right.

At the same time, I already consider them worthless so it'd be fun to do a little experiment.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Virgin Galactic. üçí Today the stock reached a recent low, the mid 20s, by recent I mean within a 2 month time lapse. This is a volatile stock that weeks ago reached a high of 60 when the company promised a test flight, now it promises to try again later this month.

The bear case is that history will repeat itself and another cancellation to a test flight will take place. It‚Äôs not just that this company isn‚Äôt ready, it‚Äôs that it breaks promises, from its CEOs mouth, to the lack of commitment from Chamath, to the minimal posts placed by its social accounts. VG has built a reputation of lying, hiding, and postponing. As it continues to burn through cash, it‚Äôs competitors inch ever closer to offering a similar experience, making us wonder if VG will ever take off or if it will become an example, a premature predecessor to an new industry sector. Should the company not be ready for flight in the near future, many feel as if it will not be worth holding in the short term, and numerical suggestions leaves you wondering if the revenue will be sufficient to pay off losses unless a significant price drop in services occurs. In that case, the gains this stock can generate don‚Äôt hold up to the patience and expectations held by current investors, not since the 1950s has anyone been content with a yearly under-double-digit stock gain... but I digress..

Enter the bull case...VG hasn‚Äôt had an accident in ages, despite it‚Äôs elongated pause and minor glitches the company stays committed to ensuring high safety. Confidence is shown in its operations by the rollout of a new plane model, building towards a new fleet of vehicles. Hiring continues and building of its experience offering grows. For retail investors, a pattern of increase in price before its test flight is written on your forehead as well as the blackboard, you have T-minus 19 days for it to reach another high point in case of swing trade. Then, enter Cathie Wood, (you‚Äôve probably never heard of her, let‚Äôs just say she‚Äôs kinda smart), she buys the stock at the recent lows....spoiler alert, this is a sign that the stock is undervalued, got it bucko? Besides the possible swing trade to take advantage of there is the chance that the test flight succeeds and VG begins to see the ‚Äúfinish line‚Äù and we enter a fucking NEW ERA, Branson breaks into tears(again) and the roaring twenties literally begin with SPCE.

So, I didn‚Äôt come here to give suggestions for shopping, it‚Äôs just a stock I have taken attention to, your choices are yours.

*NOTE: In an era with pent up demand for travel of any kind, VG isn‚Äôt rushing what can‚Äôt be rushed. Boeing is having planes grounded for different reasons every month, SpaceX is making it rain metal in boca chica, Blue Origin might as well not exist, ... VG continues without explosions, without major recalls, yet gets criticism without comparison.

*NOTE: the unofficial slogan for this company is ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt nobody else doing it with planes‚Äù, appointed by it‚Äôs retail investors and enthusiasts. 

NOTE: Virgin Orbit stock is set to premiere in roughly a year.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Maxeon Technologies - 10 Years Hi all! I'm here today to talk about Maxeon Solar Technologies, and to gather some other opinions on it.

A few months ago I heard about Maxeon. I read up on it and liked what I saw enough to invest a small amount. At one point the stock had appreciated in value by 180% - however, due to the fact that I had already decided to hold onto it for at least the next few years, I didn't sell. It's now almost back at the price I first purchased it. I'm not hugely bothered, as I do think in the coming years it has a good chance of bouncing back. If I see a stock rise that high in such a short time, maybe next time I'll sell some.

Anyway, what's everyone's thoughts about it becoming a possible big player in the solar industry? I'm aware its financials aren't currently the best, but I'm still hopeful. I'm the only person I know who's into investing/stocks, so I don't have anyone to discuss this with.

As with many people who've invested in speculative tech, I've recently taken quite a hit to my portfolio, down 32% from my absolute peak in mid February. That's still up 33% since last November, so whilst I'm a little sad, the big picture really isn't that bad for me. If anyone has any stocks they're particularly bullish on, let me know - I'm going to completely re-organize my short term/swing trade portfolio into longer term holds now that the explosive growth phase seems to be faltering.

Thanks for reading!"
2021-04-12 22:39:38,stocks,"I‚Äôm in a similar boat - down 50% from all time highs but up more than 100% from October (plenty of time left for the that to change though). 

I really like Maxeon. They make some of the best panels, and have worldwide distribution. Their revenues are strong as well. They reported Q4 from 2020 late, and while they did very well on earnings per share (beating estimates by quite a bit, 0.11 vs -1.1), and beat on revenue, their guidance for Q1 was poor because of coronavirus lockdowns in Europe. Their stock has slid 30% or so this week, which to me seems an overreaction given the sunnier EPS. That said, perhaps it is overvalued in the first place and is regressing to the mean faster than the rest of the industry. 

I don‚Äôt think this will bounce back fast, though I think the haircut is much more than is warranted by the data. I would recommend carefully buying in small bits. Green energy as a whole is still in free fall, and I don‚Äôt know what the bottom is or how far we are from it."
2021-04-13 00:09:33,stocks,"Maxeon seems to have one of the best growth outlooks of the solar panel stocks I've looked into as well!

&#x200B;

$NTR  - Consistent higher lows and a great looking channel up is forming. If we can capture one more full move it could be amazing.

&#x200B;

$OEC  - Channel is muddier than usual but it is there still. It often tests this trend to bounce off of, so this may be a quick mover for us.

&#x200B;

$OPTT - Bouncing exactly where we want it to. Has high reward but higher than usual risk, make sure you have defined parameters before entering. 

&#x200B;

$SBSW - I think we may get a bit better of a deal here if we continue to pull back as a market -- but this value is obvious and so is the low risk you can enter for.

&#x200B;

$TSE  - I would wait now, I want to BREAK and HOLD above the resistance, once we do we can use it as as a support, but until then it is too much risk here.

&#x200B;

$UCTT - There is a lot of institutional and analyst support for this one. Beautiful trend up, we just have to hope the move up is as strong as the previous one's.

I don't think I have the patience needed or the temperament for red days(weeks). I want to focus on the only thing that seems to be working consistently - ETFs. 

Looking for some feedback about some potential buy's based on what I already have:

|Bought|Focus|Potential |Focus|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SCHX|DOW/Large Cap|VXUS|International|
|QQQ|Nasdaq|VTV|Value|
|SCHD|DIV|VB|Small Cap|
|VYM|High Yield DIV|VO|Mid Cap|
|VWO|Emerging Markets|||
|VEA|Developed Markets|||

I'm missing tech/bio/clean energy, but am open to any good leads. 

I decided to go with SCHX over SPY due to the general yield being a bit higher along with a lower ER. Though I know SCHX isn't strictly an S&P 500 ETF so I wonder if I should have something that specifically targets the S&P even if it leads to redundancy among the top holdings - something I already have to an extent with QQQ and SCHX. 

I'd like to have about 1-2K in each ETF to start in an attempt to completely balance things, but I feel like that isn't the best call and curious what yall think about that approach. 

Any feedback, recommendations or suggestions are much appreciated, thanks!"

2021-04-12 20:13:38,stocks,scared money dont make money
2021-04-12 22:02:21,stocks,Market will pull back the moment you go in
2021-04-13 00:02:26,stocks,"You could be waiting weeks or months (or more) for the ""pullback."" A lot of folks wait for a pullback while the stock or ETF they're wanting to buy goes up 25%, then they buy when it drops 5-10% from there and think they've done well, even though they're worse off than if they'd just invested from the get go.

If it's going to be too psychologically painful, start DCAing into it - put $X in every 2 weeks regardless of what the price is doing.

If the market keeps going up, you'll look back and wish you'd just put it in all at once. If it goes down during that time, you'll get more shares at lower prices.

Also, studies and analysis have shown that putting a lump sum in usually works out better in the long run than DCAing into a position.

If it was me, I'd just put it into VOO (or some mix of ETFs you're comfortable with) and let it roll. If you're planning to hold for an extended period of time, even if there was a 10% correction the day after you invested, it's not going to make that much of a difference in the long run."

or whatever doesn‚Äôt make much sense unless you think a big sustained crash is on the horizon or something. Index funds aren‚Äôt due for a correction or overbought just bc of ATH talk.

Is there a mechanism for determining how well stocks you actually own performed against a benchmark?

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Question on DD and how to pursue smarter investments Question on DD and how to pursue investments that aren‚Äôt a gamble.

When you go to look at an investment into an equity do you usually pick and choose random stocks on a list then proceed to do DD on that equity and if so how do you conduct that DD to be sure it‚Äôs an investment you would be willing to pursue (what steps do you usually take for DD)

I am asking for this information because lately I have felt like I‚Äôm in a casino and I don‚Äôt enjoy it.

I encured my first loss as well this week and don‚Äôt want to feel so out of control on an investment again."
2021-04-12 21:30:29,stocks,"hedge funder here. 

The type of DD you need depends on what kind of return you are trying to extract from the market. Like if you want to be an active investor, what edge do you have over a professional at say Vanguard Value Fund or XYZ Co Growth Fund? For most people, there is no edge, so you should focus on investing in who you think are the best managers (and rotate through that).

&#x200B;

However, say you 1) want to build an edge or 2) just enjoy being in the market, then you should really focus on understanding what drives returns. Broadly speaking, for equity investments, the value of a security is equal to the sum of all future cash flows discounted back to present value. This means a stock price is based upon 1) forecasts of future cash flows and 2) forecasts of future discount rates. 

If you want to ""invest"" (e.g. time horizon on a single stock is 1-5+ years) then really focus on finding companies that you think have higher-than-average growth potential, and then invest in a portfolio of them. 

&#x200B;

Your due diligence for such an investment strategy will focus on 1) ensuring that your portfolio co's actually do have a TAM that is meaningful/viable products/competent management team/etc., 2) that you are buying them at a fair value (e.g. stock price is trading below the present value of your estimated future cash flows), and 3) that you are monitoring them for major updates to ensure they are not diverging from your thesis over time.

This is very general but it's a good starting point. Hope it helps."
2021-04-12 20:10:17,stocks,"I go through other people's holdings, fund holdings, word of mouth for start points. Then I research the company and stock at a macro level to see if they have a good business and product/idea and if their market cap makes sense within their sector. Then I look at financials looking for weakness they have to have good and increasing FCF, revenue, and profit margin, good P/E, debt/equity, price/book, etc. If they're still in the running, then I do a valuation using DFC, WACC, and whatever I have time for or can find. I then do calculations/look for projections of their future earnings and compare this to the current value. These are all compared to the rest of the companies in that sector to see where they are. If they pass and I feel they are fairly valued and owning the shares would be profitable, then I do a TA and look for an entry. If there's no clear entry, I just buy and accumulate. If it appears that a pivot may be coming, then I pick a target and enter that way or using CSPs.

It‚Äôs also more fun to do DD on stuff you care about. But it‚Äôs also easier to get swept up in trading emotionally that way which isn‚Äôt good. 

My other method is ‚Äúlook at what Yahoo is recommending today‚Äù then ‚Äúlook at what WSB is hyping up‚Äù and then buying what WSB says because their DDs look more thorough. This has absolutely not been profitable (yet) but it has been fun."

These are serious products that are actually in use right now. Having that said it's nothing really world changing. I might as well invest in some industrial manufacturing company. I was also invested in Versarien but forgot why I have bought them in the first place. I think I sold them eventually as after many years of research they only produce graphene enhanced face masks and jackets... Haydale is also poorly regarded company with not much good tech.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 12, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 12, 2021**

Stocks traded mostly even on Monday, with the market taking a breather after the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recorded several fresh highs last week. Looking ahead, market participants will focus on the upcoming Quarter 1 earnings report slated to be released in the next weeks. Big banks are kicking off the earnings season starting Wednesday premarket. 

As earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.

Year-to-date, the cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening sectors have broadly outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher last year. The first quarter of 2021 was defined by the rotation out of high-flying tech stocks and into companies poised to directly benefit from the reopening of the economy. However, now that Quarter 2 started, we are seeing the rotation back into growth and tech stocks, with mega-cap companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) driving the market to record levels. In our view, while we expect tech stocks to continue performing well, it is highly unlikely they replicate the outsized performance from 2020 and continue to look for opportunities in companies that were most affected by COVID and that are poised to benefit from the reopening of the economy. Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note ‚ÄúThe initial reopening of the economy will trigger a huge rebound in margins across sectors which have been hit hardest by the COVID crisis. The unprecedented surge in households' cash balances over the past year ‚Äì mostly due to the enforced drop in spending on services, augmented by stimulus payments ‚Äì represents a potential wave of demand, while supply is constrained by business failures.‚Äù

* Microsoft (MSFT) announced Monday morning that it agreed to purchase artificial intelligence speech recognition company Nuance Communications (NUAN) in an all-cash transaction valued at $19.7 billion, including Nuance's debt.

These are a few hypothetical scenarios that illustrate the risks and the underperformance over time, and why the leveraged ETFs are ""not designed to be held long term.""

Let's say there's a crash and QQQ drops 30%. For QQQ to recover to its original price, it needs to gain about 43%. Let's say, for simplicity, even though this is incredibly unlikely, QQQ drops 30% in one day and gains 43% the next day. Now TQQQ drops 90% the first day and gains 129% the second day. The 129% gain sounds great, but it's on such a small number after the 90% loss that after the two days, QQQ is sitting at 100% of its original value, and TQQQ is sitting at a measly 22.9% of its original value üòû No good!

Every time there's a direction reversal in the index, the 3x leveraged index loses a little performance. Because the gains are always on a smaller number than the losses. Not so drastic as in the crash scenario. But you end up underperforming over time on average.

Actually, in a string of consecutive gaining days, the leveraged index does better than 3x. Say QQQ gains 5% two days in a row (using big numbers again to magnify effects). Then it's up 10.25% after two days. TQQQ gained 15% on each of those two days, and is up 32.25%. That's actually a little more than 3 times 10.25%! But on average, in the real world markets, the underperformance from changing direction tends to dwarf the overperformance from consecutive green days.

TLDR: 3x leveraged index ETFs might do really well, but they also carry more risk, and tend to give less than 3x profit over time."
2021-04-13 02:24:31,stocks,"I have read all these kinds of threads enough, it's all 'been there, done that'. 

The simple fact of the matter is there are 2 scenarios where TQQQ will be fucked - a real crash that took years to recover, and the market trading sideways for a long time. All other scenarios, TQQQ will be better than normal QQQ if you got the balls to hold through and have dry powder to add at the bottom of the correction. 

The market seems extremely unstable right now but honestly I'm willing to take that risk. It's not a set-and-forget investment like VOO/VTI, in the end it's just simply more risk, more return. You can absolutely hold this long term but you need to watch for those 2 scenarios that TQQQ will die."
2021-04-13 05:30:42,stocks,I have a friend that heavily trades TQQQ and is very active with it selling the highs and then rebuying the lows. He tried to explain it and briefly tried to teach me to read the charts but I couldn‚Äôt get it. He does quite well with this. I saw his numbers for myself. Very impressive.

2021-04-12 22:01:12,stocks,"A sustained bear market will obliterate your holdings, as will a crash. (theoretically) Like, if TQQQ had existed before the dot com bubble, that crash would probably would have resulted in TQQQ losing well over 99% over 2 years, and still wouldn't have recovered from that after 20 years.

But this is less true for the 2008/2020 crashes, thanks to government intervention that resulted in stock values recovering pretty quickly.

So the question is two independent parts: do you trust the government to intervene in larger market crashes like they did in 2008/2020? Or do you see repeat of the dot com bubble deflation?"
2021-04-13 01:05:25,stocks,"the scary part is large single day drop.  if it is 10 percent drop every day for a few day, it isn't so bad.

A portfolio 100% in TQQQ before the dot com crash would still be no where close to recovering today.  That graph would illustrate how TQQQ would have performed had it been around."
2021-04-13 08:37:34,stocks,"What you say about patience would be true if the 3x-ETF was leveraging the long-termn movements of QQQ. But it's only designed to do it for daily movements. After that, the losses are locked in before the next day. It's not true that with patience you are guaranteed to come ahead with TQQQ, even if we agree that it's true for QQQ. There are other factors too (greater expenses).

Also, you talk about planning to time the market to get ahead. Not the best idea. Data shows that you are likely to miss the after-dip recovery trying to do so."
2021-04-13 12:37:35,stocks,"Only if you let that money sit there. If you set an amount of money to invest each week, that average will lower down very quick.

I bought one share to see how it'd move, and I'm $30 up already. It's not much, but if you get to the point where you have 100 shares, you can also sell covered calls, which have decent premiums thanks to its volatility"

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"TQQQ/QQQ ETF Scenarios, trying to make a strategy. But need help I was thinking about what I should do about investing into ETF's and I am kind of going insane with all the numbers and math and all that. I want to invest in QQQ, but I found out about its leveraged brother TQQQ. So now I am comparing the two, and to me, TQQQ is so much better but also so much riskier since its 3 times leveraged. I do know about that decaying thing that is happening to TQQQ but I still think its worth it. I did some scenarios of what if I bought at this time to see what happens and maybe you guys can help choose what I should do.  I did this scenario between 22 December of 2017 to April 18 2019 because I wanted to include a bear market and recovery.   

&#x200B;

Here are some examples: (Note BP means ""Buying Power"")  

&#x200B;

Just buying solely QQQ ETFs

$1000 buying power 

Buy on 22 DEC 2017 priced at $157.37. 6 stocks. Sell it on 18 Apr 2019.   6x$187.39 = $1124.34+55.78(BP)=1180.12   $180.12 Profit

&#x200B;

Just buying solely TQQQ ETFs

$1000 buying power

Buy on 22 DEC 2017 priced at $23.89. 41 stocks. Sell it on 18 Apr 2019. 41x$31.98 = $1311.18+20.51(BP)=$1331.69   $331.69 Profit 

&#x200B;

Now the reason why I chose these dates is to include the bear market of 2018. Lets say I stay with QQQ until the bear market hits. No one is perfect when it comes to a bear market, so lets say I sell it half way of a bear market on OCT 26 2018 at $166.66. and then decide to buy TQQQ on the same day for $24.88. expecting a large return rate when it bounces back.   

Buy QQQ on 22 DEC 2017 priced at $157.37. 6 stocks. Sell it on Oct 26 2018 at $166.66x6= $999.96+55.79(BP)=1055.74. Now buy TQQQ on Oct 26 2018 at $24.88. 1055.74/24.88= 42 stocks. Sell it on 18 Apr 2019 42x$31.98=$1343.16+10.78(BP)= $1353.94   So $353.94 Profit

&#x200B;

This is what is going through my head, I could :

A) Just buy TQQQ and ride it out through a bear market because its hard to judge when a bear market ends

B) Just buy QQQ because its safer and I don't need to worry about bear markets that much

C) Buy QQQ and sell when its a bear market to buy TQQQ. This option has risk because no one knows when a bear market will end... Could sell/buy too early. 

&#x200B;

So what should I do? My brain is all over the place doing all this research. I wanted a ETF because it follows the markets and its safer than an individual stock and now I am making it complicated for myself because I want max returns 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Just for fun, you can ignore this if you want:

Now lets say I have magical powers and I know where the very bottom of the bear market is. I stay with QQQ until the bear market hits the very bottom and buy TQQQ. 

QQQ very bottom $147.57 21 DEC 2018

TQQQ very bottom $16.41 21 DEC 2018

$1000 buying power 

Buy QQQ on 22 DEC 2017 priced at $157.37. 6 stocks. Sell it on Dec 21 2018 at $147.57. 147.57x6= $884.42+55.78(BP)= $940.20

Buy TQQQ at $16.41 on DEC 21 2018. $940.20/16.41= 57 stocks. Sell on Apr 18 2019 57x31.98= $1822.86+4.83(BP)=$1827.69    $827.69 profit"

If you are young, and have no significant financial responsibilities then you may as well invest everything, and hold 3-6 months worth of cash as an emergency fund (enough cash where if you lost your job you could continue living your life for another 3-6 months). 

If you need more immediate money for a house, car, etc. you can keep more cash on the side probably. But in general I would invest aggressively and keep the minimal necessary cash you needed

&#x200B;

What generally happens is that a lot of companies are created just to rape the retail investors and never recover. Sometimes it is just that the management is shit and profits early on off the investors but then doesn't try any more cause ""I GOT MINE"".

When the markets crash then these kinds of stock take a huge hit and they will never recover from them because there is zero fundamentals to make them recover. Each crash kicks the price time. 

Every once in a while the stock WILL profit though if it is being used to defraud investors again.

&#x200B;

Ultimately you are going to have to figure it out. If you won't ever make profit off it then you could be using that money in something else. If you did your DD first you might not be in this position.

You could sell 4 and keep one and if something special happens the stock might go to 200 and then you will recoup at least something and maybe you can make money off the money you got and break even.

Then what you get you could donate to some impoverished community to make the world a better place because most likely if I didn't tell you this shit you would have lost it all anyways. \[Of course you want to donate it directly cause a lot of charities are scams.

Wrong reason to hold. Do you still have faith? Then keep holding. You aren't owed money because you bought at a certain price. You'll lose again with that attitude. 

If the reason you bought still stands, then nothing needs to change. But if you're trying to squeeze blood from a stone after things change sometimes it is better to move on."
2021-04-12 23:54:40,stocks,"I think you're relating to the stocks a little unhealthily. It's not a person and it certainly doesn't owe you anything. Breaking this naive self-centered worldview early helps give you more certainty when the day comes that you lose far more than $100. There's no shame in losing if you don't have your ego in it, but once your ego is wrapped up in it you tend to lose really big. Try to make it about observing society doing its thing. Will the particular stock grow over time with the market? Probably, if they have a stable business - and if they don't, then why did you invest in them anyway? Right, so, just hold it and learn to accept it being there, otherwise, if for some reason you feel you need the money or have some strong sense of what you'd rather invest it in, then sell it and use the tax deduction from the loss at the end of the year when you do taxes."

There are lessons everywhere and figuring out why you lost so bad is something you shouldn't move on from until you understand what you did and/or the market did. Otherwise, you will develop a money losing habit which will turn you away from investment. 

On flip side, there's nothing wrong with liquidating a loser if you have a 'sure thing.' Then it makes sense to take a loss as an opportunity cost but that is incredibly rare."

If the stock is falling and you are bearish on it, sell a covered call at or around the current price!

Yes you could bag hold and hope for it to rebound if you think that‚Äôs what will happen, but if you don‚Äôt see it going up anytime soon and you don‚Äôt want to be stuck holding a losing stock, sell a covered call!"

2021-04-13 02:00:42,stocks,Not a good mindset. You should put your money to work in the best investments you can find at any given time regardless of past performance. There is potentially a huge opportunity cost to holding your stock if you no longer think the fundamentals are good.

If i keep my 150 usd in that stock for 1-5 more years waiting for it to grow back to initial investment of 300 usd. 
I will lose the chance to put that money in another stock that will grow based on your Research.
Here is the example
GLSI stock lost me 150 usd and now i m waiting for it to grow.
I see ACST stock at .50 cents and decide its a great price to jump in due to my research.
Option A
Put my spare 100 usd into the company
Option B
Put my spare 100 usd and pull out on GLSI which amounts to 150 usd. Making total of 250 usd investment.
If your research is good and the stock hits double its value, you make back your money in less than a month insteadibg of waiting for that particular stock.

The main point is pull out if you find a diamond stock to invest in.

If losing money on the stock upsets you you need to go back to the drawing board and figure out which of these holds true to you."
2021-04-13 14:57:06,stocks,I bought 3500 NTEK - Nanotech Entertainment at $2 a share back in September 2013. There was about 30 million daily volume by October 2013 I doubled my money. I was expecting it to get to its IPO of $8. Then it started to go down. And trying to not have paper hands I thought I would just hold. Fast forward multiple splits (reverse) - cut my loses and kept a little just in case it ever came back. I currently own about 500 shares at 0.0086 per share or about $4 total. If I sell it I can‚Äôt even cover the transaction fee. Lol. But YOLO - üíéüôåüèº?!! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2021-04-13 16:55:47,stocks,"Its a well known phycological principle and should be discarded.

Every day you own the stock, you should ask yourself if you would buy the stock if you had the cash instead of the stock.  If the answer is yes, keep it, if the answer is no, then sell it."
2021-04-13 17:03:47,stocks,That‚Äôs your problem is that you‚Äôre emotional about it. GLSI and the stock market in general don‚Äôt care who you are and don‚Äôt owe you anything. Before you get into a stock make an exit (stop loss) and take profit plan based on support and resistance. Position size to the amount of risk you are willing to accept. If previous support is .50 under your entry and you are only willing to risk $50 on the trade then buy a 100 ish shares. If the stock price breaks through your stop loss area then cut your loss and move on.  If the stock is really volatile then use a smaller position size to account for the larger gaps between support and resistance.  Best tip - don‚Äôt get emotional about a stock - that is the number one way to make sure you are a consistent loser in the market !

You might want to face the fact you are bad at this and just put it all in an index fund

2021-04-13 19:58:17,stocks,Same here on a couple -- funny how that works.  You loose 90% and the rest seems like chump change.  Brokerages used to charge to sell so better just to keep at that point.  Worst case you sell to offset gains.  Then one day you wonder why your brokerage account is to high and come to find it it was because that looser blossomed.  Sweet!

2021-04-12 22:19:53,stocks,Ride that bitch for life I do.
2021-04-13 07:07:13,stocks,"Yup.  I bought a company at 13.5 because I believed in them and thought it was undervalued.  Went down to 10, bought more.  Then 8, bought more.  Then 6, bought more until I ran out of my side investment money (not betting the house on it).

They went as low at 5 before riding back up to 11ish and now I'm up a decent amount.  I still believe in them and still think they're undervalued, so I'm still holding.

If I had been trading with emotions, I could see myself either selling because of fomo opportunity cost, or not buying more when it went down which would've limited or erased my gains so far."
2021-04-13 10:19:15,stocks,"I stick to a 20% stop loss but stop losses can be very bad unless the price keeps dropping past my sell point.  I've done backtests on probably close to 100k trades (2008-2018 time frame, 4000 stock tickers) in my strategy and unless the price keeps dropping, a stop loss usually incurs a net loss because the stock eventually recovers some of the loss.  So, my only working process now is 20% stop loss, make a watch or alarm to keep an eye if the stock starts recovering and try to time reentry."

So I looked into it some more to get reacquainted, found some counter cases as well.  
And everything together made me ask myself whether I really knew what I was doing with that company, so I left it behind. I didn't lose much only like 20 bucks or so.

2021-04-12 22:28:59,stocks,You‚Äôve got to be one stupid investor to bash any ARK etf. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry your investment is up 2x-5x with our funds.‚Äù SMH ü•±üôÑ ARK bets heavy on Tesla and some other big future plays that are in a dip. If you bought any ARK at conception you‚Äôre over the moon. GTFO of here with that noise.

2021-04-13 05:46:08,stocks,"That's why investing companies you actually believe in or use their products/services is one of the best ways to play the market especially in the beggining, vs trying to hit it big with a random stock that looks good at first. When the stock goes lower you have actual basis to help determine if you think it will recover, such as knowing they have quality products, good customer service, good marketing etc, vs losing faith in a bet and possibly selling too soon."
2021-04-13 06:03:08,stocks,"I only have about 2grand in right now and basically bricked half of it in losing stocks (discovery and Airbnb)

I‚Äôve tempted to throw more money into the system to keep swing trading (to learn, and it‚Äôs fun!)

But I‚Äôm forcing myself to just wait it out. Since I‚Äôm still less than a month in‚ÄîI promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt put more money into until after 3 months. 

I‚Äôm just sad that I bricked half my portfolio so soon!! Originally it was just 200 bucks locked up, but I kept trying to buy the dip to average it out, but the stocks kept falling =p

Good lessons to learn for sure!"

2021-04-13 14:58:37,stocks,The implication is that frequency of trading and human emotions often make people make poorer investment decisions. It might just be that that most of those accounts were VTI and simple broad index funds but I would also argue that if someone can beat VOO consistently in their account for 15+ years is extremely skilled and quite rare/lucky.

2021-04-13 07:26:31,stocks,"Do not take advice from WSB, lol. Averaging down only helps if the stock is about to shoot back up. Lots just stay down, and then so does your portfolio. Also, traditional trading for decent ROI is usually boring, and you hold for years (long on a stock). Most things will go up over time, even if it's incremental (unless it tanks and goes under). 


Day trading is where you try to make profits on small swings by timing it perfectly within the day (thus the name). Options trading is something you should probably avoid for now!"

2021-04-13 03:31:27,stocks,"TBF the thing with buying the dip is that they don't have to reach those same highs technically for you to still make profit/ break even.

You just have to believe they'll go up at least slightly."
2021-04-12 23:07:59,stocks,"Not unreasonable either way üëçüèº just interesting to think about financial biases. Everyone is always warning about panic selling, but emotionally people are much more apt to over-hold."

But you learn to be more confident in your descions, so that even if goes back up, you know that when you sold, you made the right choice For You at the time. Also, keeping a few shares instead of selling all of them, can help ease that feeling of what if takes off and I miss it, as well as being able to get a better feel for what a stock is doing with much less risk and emotion."

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Any interest in $VOF, and Vietnamese stocks in general? So I'm a small time investor, really just doing this as a hobby but was interested to hear views on Vietnam stocks as a broad topic. I was initially looking for interesting Hong Kong stocks since I have family roots there, but nothing really appealed and the political situation there isn't great. Have never been keen on China stocks since losing a little bit on NIO. Then I started looking at Taiwan and stumbled across $VOF, which so afar has been the only Vietnam-based ticker I've found and that I can invest in on eToro .

&#x200B;

It seems to me Vietnam is in a great place right now. Large population, politically stable, with lots of scope for development. I get the feeling the country as a whole is on the cusp of something good in terms of devleopment and prosperity. There's just something about the place that has a certain appeal right now. 

&#x200B;

Any thoughts and any other tickers you could recommend watching?"
2021-04-12 20:07:31,stocks,"I've invested in VOF since 2019. I run very diversified portfolio and VOF is about a percent or two of it but still very happy with returns so far. Not many people know but Vietnam is Frontier Market (which is a step below EM) so you will not get exposure to Vietnam via Emerging Markets ETF. So if you want Vietname exposure this is good fund to hold. Overall I really like Vietnam. Even before recent tensions with China many mega manufacturers been relocating to Vietnam because China is getting too expensive but with China-US tensions moving to Vietnam will happen even faster. Also, Vietnam has young and well educated population. People are eager to work and diligent and as I said labour is cheaper than in China. They have dealt with COVID superbly and was one of the first nations to be COVID free. Equities in Vietnam are still quite cheap too. I think Vietnam right now is like China 20 years ago. There are so many good things to say about Vietnam but I won't make this too long. I only have small position in this fund but it has been performing well and I'm quite excited about it."

First of all. I'm a rookie and I'm still learning the ropes.
I'm not asking if I did a good trade or what I should do next. I'm not even asking for advice.
I''m just trying to figure out the math on something that I cannot find online because I don't know what I should be looking for.

So here it goes:

I bought 118$ worth of SVRA @2.36$ couple weeks ago
The price started to decline.
Now SVRA is @1.78$
(Actually -25% on my investment right now)

This should've been a day/week trade but as I'm a rookie I'm still learning but now I'm holding the bag. 

I recently sold another stock with profit. 
So I now have 600$ to spend. 

What would happen if I spend 600$ or part of this money on SVRA at the price it is now?
Will this lower my average% loss on the previous trade, leveling out? Making it easier to break-even or even gain profit? 
How do I go and calculate this for myself so I don't need to bother you guys for advice?
I've tried using Position calculators but that doesn't tell me what I need to know. 

Can anyone explain how I can calculate this 'averaging' for next time if I'd want to do something like this?

I can provide additional details if that would be necessary.

Thank you

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Buying and selling a single stock, to learn? I‚Äôve been in the stock market for about 6 months now. Life has been crazy busy for me lately and I wasn‚Äôt making good returns anyways so I withdrew everything except for $50. I figured I could let it sit until I felt like playing with it again. I‚Äôve done quite a bit or research into swing trading and that‚Äôs definitely what I‚Äôd like to do. So my question is 

Is it a good idea to trade a stock of a company over and over again week to week? I figured doing this could allow me to dive deeper into some more fundamental aspects of stocks and maybe technicals I had missed. I‚Äôd be able to easily track news since I‚Äôd only need to follow the market as a whole and my specific stock.

The other way I thought of doing this was to just trade a single stock each week. Which is what I‚Äôm leaning towards most. Buy on monday/early week dip, sell when I get a good return or by the end of the week. The idea being to have cash at the end of each week. It would serve as a nice reset each week. It would be easy to look into the week and see why the trade went well or poorly. In the weekend I‚Äôd also be looking for the next stock.

Im curious how I should go about this, If I even should. I‚Äôd be playing with $50. Idc if I lose it all. The goal would be to learn as much as possible while cutting out anything unnecessary to making a single good trade. I don‚Äôt have time to screen stocks every day. I want something simple and effective. I‚Äôm not looking at this is me investing in the sense of a portfolio. The sole purpose is to learn. 

I figured I‚Äôd probably be safe going for large or medium cap stocks since they roll with the market more, but at the same time I‚Äôd like enough volatility to actually catch profit. I figure 5% is a reasonable thing to ask. 

Any information on this is appreciated."

The largest one event was the sale for a huge gain of a large development parcel next   to Auckland New Zealand's airport. This parcel was originally purchased as agricultural land and over the years was up-zoned to industrial.  Most notably, the land was not generating any cash flow (and arguably  was  costing some annual cash costs).  Concurrently with Reading's complete payoff of a very costly construction loan on Reading's 44  Union Square  development in NY City (valuable corner of 17th and Union  square), receipt of this land sales proceeds was a direct transfer of  value to  equity shareholders.

Chances of anything negative happening to the US market on that scale may seem slim, but people don't understand how much of a world power Japan used to be. Their economy seemed unstoppable, it can happen to any country if the right circumstances collide.

Some info about me: I'm in my early 20's from Europe and recently got a new job where I can pick my own pension plan.

My dilemma is whether I should stick with the company pension plan or decide my allocation myself?

Going with their high risk 100% stocks plan the yearly fee ends up being around 1.3-1.4% incl admin costs.

I was thinking of just going 100% global index fund. Yearly fee would be around .8-.9% incl admin costs.

I have my own savings in funds from my own money. I really don't mind the pension and think this system will collapse before I retire, so I'm not counting on it.

But I would like to make the best possible outcome by picking the right plan. Is it a bad idea to go 100% international index? I just want to let them set and not think about them.

To be specific,  

#### [The Esports Technologies platform will be a full suite of services and products that can be used to provide best in class esports betting experiences to customers and industry partners](https://esportstechnologies.com/technology/)

\^ you can find more about their main platform coming out on their website, as well as their prospectus, although I will say, there is not much info on two of their platforms (Esports games, & esports betting & trading exchange)

$EBET also has another platform known as Gogawi ([https://www.gogawi.us/](https://www.gogawi.us/)). The platform currently operates in the Asia/Pacific region. I don't have much on it, nor do I know anybody who uses it. I do know, however, that online gambling is rapidly growing, and alongside it, esports. 

*On their prospectus, EBET states that it supports other sports, not just esports.*

All the financials I am pulling up are going to be from the prospectus as well as Webull:

**Market Cap is $57 - 63 mill**

**Common Stock: 2,000,000**

**Outstanding Shares: 10,000,000**

**PPS =  $4.5 - $5.00** 

 **In the last 12 months, EBET had revenue of $169,444 and -$3.30 million in losses. Earnings per share was -$0.26.** 

[***Here is the Prospectus***](https://bulletin.webull.com/20210330/253772/91641cfde5c99605d22da3d636fa919d/88888)

&#x200B;

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Volatility and returns Hey guys i have some questions

QQQ‚Äòs top holdings make up more than 50% and there are 100 Stocks in the etf

Meanwhile in the lyxor robotics and ai etf the top 10 make up about 10% and there are about 150 stocks in there

Why is the robotics and ai etf more volatile and has less returns in the last weeks?

Due to its diversification?

And shouldnt it be less volatile due to its diversification?

Im severely confused

EDIT: What Etf is the go to?"
2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"There's a reason why people tell you to only invest money you don't need in the foreseeable future. I've seen at least 2 post today on reddit of people claiming that they are gonna pull their money out of the stock market due to consistent losses. Most of their holding are stocks that were once popular on reddit and more than likely they bought at the very top of the hype but that's not here nor there. The fact is that if you invest money that you don't need any time soon you can just ride the wave of losses.

I'm personally living paycheck to paycheck and could definitely use the money I have invested but I keep trying to see that money as LOST already. Maybe not the greatest thing but I'm definitely not dependent on it and don't plan on using it anytime soon. There's a certain Game ticker that has lost me a ton of money these last 2 weeks and I haven't bat an eye because I'm not counting on that money. 

I know a lot of us have been and continue to be broke and when we hear people on reddit discussing a damn near certain winner you want to jump in and make some money. But the truth is most of the time it's either a Pump and Dump and more often than not these people are just wrong. 

So my advice to  you is if you can't afford to invest money and not touch it for at least a year whether it goes up or down then just don't invest that money. You'll most likely pull out too soon and just lose money."

You are destined to lose money until you learn the hard lessons.

Lesson #1: It takes a long time to build up a portfolio that turns into a true money machine. Decades long.

Lesson #2: Your money will grow very slowly until you reach this point. You will get discouraged. You will chase winners. You will buy at the wrong time. You will sell at the wrong time. As a result of your bad decisions your portfolio will take even longer to turn into a money machine.

Lesson #3: Invest everything into VTSAX. Keep investing month after month in a tax advantaged IRA. Don‚Äôt worry about whether it‚Äôs up or down. It will be boring as hell. Do this and 40 years from now you will be a multimillionaire."

2021-04-12 21:31:27,stocks,"I know some people are experiencing losses for the first time right now and I know what that feels like. Even if you‚Äôre still net green, it can be frustrating to see unrealized gains fade to black (or worse), and the temptation to salvage whatever you have can be great if you‚Äôre not sure where or when the bottom is. But as long as you realize whatever money you put into the market inherently carries risk and you‚Äôre willing to take that risk because you have a (hopefully well-informed) belief in what you hold, you shouldn‚Äôt panic.
  
I think too many people take the meming a bit too literally. I see people tossing around ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù, ‚Äúpaper hands‚Äù and ‚Äúbag-holding‚Äù like that makes them experts. The thing is, even professional investors are just doing the best they can. Yeah, it‚Äôs fun to make quick gains, and swing trades can be alluring for that reason, but I think too many people come to expect the reward without properly realizing the risk. And sometimes you can set yourself up for disappointment that way.
  
I love that more people are getting involved with investing. This should be something more people get exposure to and hopefully utilize for their own benefit. But it‚Äôs important that new investors learn and recognize that this isn‚Äôt just a game."

I think it‚Äôs good to consider it money lost, like it usually would be if you were spending it elsewhere. Find what you like and go long, but either diversify or prepare to be wrong. And when you are, learn and do better the next time. 

Tune out the noise. If trading is of interest, take more time to learn how to utilize it. Ultimately decide what‚Äôs best for yourself as no one else will truly understand what‚Äôs in your best interest. But gains are gains, if you have to earn small to not lose it all, it‚Äôs certainly a lot sexier than going down with a pretty stock.

Also, investing is not about making money. It's about making the marketplace more efficient. Every time we make a deal we are exchanging information not money. So before making any serious investment it's one's due diligence to have had a stock within one's radar before making an impulsive jump on the bandwagon.

To expand on the exchanging information, some exchanges are misinformed, so sometimes the outcome is not what is aimed for. Hell sometimes people have luck, but the information on the screen is backed by billions of data points.

A metaphor I like to use is that investing is no different then the persistent hunter strategy.

2021-04-13 10:08:45,stocks,"I have been at this game for decades. People ask me for advice all the time. I suggest that people make small ""Jesse Livermore Test Trades"" to test their theory against operational evidence. Was your conviction confirmed? Should you add now or cut your losses immediately and sell. Rinse and repeat.

Life and investing are learning processes. After every trade ask oneself ""What did I learn that will benefit me?"" STOP. Write that info down and reread if before your next trade. Every dollar is a soldier you earned with the time of your life. Don't send them to die because you have a hunch. Fight hard for your life, and justify with wisdom, any losses you have.

No one is going to get rich for you, and if they do you will lose it because you are not teaching yourself to learn. 

It is almost impossible to learn from other's mistakes. Witness your reaction to this post. 

Good hunting!"
2021-04-13 10:14:33,stocks,By using only play money it doesn't hurt as bad. This morning I saw the big red dip and bought it! Averaging down on two favorites! wahoo!

2021-04-13 10:40:28,stocks,"The biggest long term problem is those who‚Äôve lost and pull their money never come back.  They say ‚Äúit‚Äôs rigged‚Äù  ‚Äútoo risky‚Äù etc.  well if you‚Äôve only owned GME, AMC, TSLA etc sure but if you‚Äôve owned quality shares like Coke, Microsoft, and 100 others you‚Äôve made money and are perfectly happy, SO I ask, is the market rigged OR did you just make bad choices and blaming ‚Äúthe market‚Äù???"
2021-04-13 10:59:39,stocks,"Research has consistently shown that holding quality stocks for the long-term is a better strategy than day trading trendy stocks. No one knows in any one day, week, or even year what the market is going to do, but long-term trends can be predictable and are usually positive if you‚Äôre well-diversified in quality companies. Invest your money in reputable companies that can stand the test of time, mutual funds, or index funds and then forget about it for 5+ years. It‚Äôs okay to rebalance once or twice a year, but if you‚Äôre a retail investor doing anything else you might as well just go to a casino cause you‚Äôre just gambling"
2021-04-13 11:11:17,stocks,"I assume all my stocks are going into my ‚Äúbuy a house‚Äù fund in 5 years.  If that doesn‚Äôt happen, they‚Äôre retirement.  That‚Äôs is, that‚Äôs all. The money is gone as far as day to day goes."
2021-04-13 13:16:35,stocks,"Exactly. Some traders made a huge amount of money buying GME early, then watched much of the gain go down the drain. Some on this forum have poured their life savings into GME and a few other stocks. At least one sold his house and put the money into GME. This is just pure madness fueled by uncontrolled greed and inexperience. It's gambling. Might as well sell your house and go to Las Vegas and put it all down on red or black. The stock market isn't a one way trip. We have been in a roaring bull market but now things are slowing down."
2021-04-13 17:24:58,stocks,The average person wants to get rich quickly or see the whole getting rich perspective in stocks like everyone else. There are cases of people making millions from Tesla or Game stock or what may have you. It's like the lottery.

2021-04-12 20:56:59,stocks,Its almost like gambling in a casino. You go to the casino knowing that $500 you brought will most likely be gone before you go home. Sometimes you get lucky and make it back or more. But most of the time you lose it all
2021-04-12 23:43:26,stocks,"Yeah, you‚Äôre right. I pretty much got lucky on the GME hype before it plunged because of RH. Since Feb til a few weeks ago, my stocks were around -24% at its lowest. I was very much hit hard especially on my MSFT, ARKK, TSLA, and some of my APPL since I bought more of them around February before the market correction when I sold my GME. I didn‚Äôt panic because while I‚Äôm not as experienced when it comes to investing, I have a pretty good mindset when it comes to gambling money.

When I go to casino, I decide how much money I‚Äôm willing to spend/lose  and that once you decided on that amount, you should treat it as ‚Äúnot your money‚Äù anymore. That‚Äôs why I never went bankrupt üòÇ"

I can‚Äôt believe someone thought a bunch of redditors with little to no experience were going to get the best of the most competitive and sophisticated and well-funded professional investors on the planet.

The game is not ‚Äúrigged‚Äù against you or for them BTW. Imagine a bunch of redditors decided they could learn to play baseball in a week and beat the All Star team. Imagine hedge fund managers take a weekend coding class and declare they are going to find the next 0day in iOS. You‚Äôd laugh at them. But that‚Äôs what happened here. It‚Äôs a fucking joke."

2021-04-13 01:22:27,stocks,"Yeah I agree about going long. I got M1 finance and love the pie system. 75% of my portfolio is indexes and funds, some paying out dividends, then 25% my picks, which are mostly blue chip stocks or stocks I like. It‚Äôs a lot easier to set and forget."
2021-04-13 02:18:18,stocks,100% thats why i laugh at most of the people on reddit who cry about wishing they bought certain stocks or coins years ago

2021-04-13 11:40:52,stocks,"Small correction:

> Reddit pump and dump ~~misinformation~~ information.

There is at least on study claiming  that investing information found on Reddit is actually better then from many other sources."
2021-04-12 23:04:52,stocks,"SPY is a long-term money printer. Any casual investor, not trader, should just dump their entire portfolio into that or an S&P-based fund and look at it maybe once a month. It's one of the few financial things in life where the odds are actually in your favor."
2021-04-13 02:05:31,stocks,"Some backstory about the recent rotation this last month for anyone who is curious:  

Retail traders by and large stopped putting into the market about a month ago.  Turns out in a lot of places in the country you can go out and start spending money again on things.  However, institutional traders and investors are still putting into the market at the same rate, so if you own stock professionals are trading or you're investing you've been in the green, but if you're a young retail trader you probably bought what all the other retail traders bought and because retail traders are not putting into the market any more, it's a blood bath for these people."
2021-04-13 02:15:42,stocks,"Yep.  It's almost like the game is rigged.  If you are a high income earner short term capital gains tax is killer.  For me short term capital gains tax is 47%!  If I yoloed at GME and doubled my initial investment, almost half of those profits would go to the government.

The richer you are the more you're incentivized towards long term capital gains.  But here is the catch:  People who invest their P&L from long term capital gains make wwaaayy more than people who trade for short term capital gains.  The government is forcing me to make more money against my own emotions.

And then it continues further.  If you're a very high earner, much higher than me, odds are you're a workaholic so you don't have time to stock pick, so instead you just throw your money at VOO r/fire style or diversify internationally /r/boggleheads style.  It's low effort low work and you just don't have the time to think about anything else.  These strategies make more than stock picking.  Again the game is setup where if you're wealthy it forces you into the optimal strategy and screws over those who are not.  It's almost like the game is rigged.

edit: Nice username btw /u/Diffie-Hellman."
2021-04-13 12:18:34,stocks,What was the position?
2021-04-12 21:08:47,stocks,"Who is this Warren Buffet everyone keeps talking about? Sounds like some kind of expert restaurateur. Is he related to that Warren Buffett guy, the famous investor up in Omaha?"
2021-04-12 22:11:05,stocks,To be fair he is wealthy and can weather shit markets. Even if you throw money you can lose onto the market you also need to have a stop loss. Holding when your stock is -60% means you're not getting your money back. Few exceptions apply but in general you do need to cut your losses.

2021-04-13 01:56:25,stocks,"I heard the advice to always keep 15-20% cash on hand in your portfolio and it has made a huge difference for me. This way I can buy the dips without having to sell another stock I like (which is probably about to rebound too!) OR dip into my low ass checking account.

Another side effect has been less and less of an impulse to buy a hot new stock on a whim straight out of my checking account (these apps allowing you to trade before they get the money transferred are both perfect and terrible for people wanting to get started trading lol)."
2021-04-13 01:53:07,stocks,Dips last 3-8 weeks.  For most people that is enough time to wait for a paycheck to come in.
2021-04-13 04:14:38,stocks,"I keep about 5-10% of my portfolio liquid at any given time.

Idea is to keep adding 70-80% of my savings every month/ quarter and forget about it. About 20-30% is ""actively managed"" but even that is in stocks I know won't be making any big moves for months.
I've become a lot calmer, less stressed about my savings, and I don't worry as much about what the market does on a daily basis, which is a tremendous relief.
Apart from QQQ I also want to add some bond ETFs so if anyone has good suggestion for even safer investments let me know!

I appreciate your rebalancing strategy too! I feel there has been too much micro-level dd coursing around as of late, though.

But what about a DD or primer that attacks that stock and its brethren‚Äîmarginally profitable EV tech‚Äîfrom a high-altitude view, inclusive of headwinds, tailwinds, the lowdown on investing in Chinese firms (in this specific case, at least), American governance, international governance, the impact of interest rates on the market, etc.

What I‚Äôm talking about is just value investing a decent personal finance. Consider everything that takes away from your returns ‚Äî taxes, fees, expense ratios in ETFs, premiums, etc. ‚Äî and try to limit those to optimize returns. It applies to investing over trading. I get a little envious of lucky bastards that manage to make a lot of quick money, but I‚Äôm a bit more risk adverse. I‚Äôll make it slower but keep the greatest portion of capital gains that I can manage. It‚Äôs more or less frugal. 

The game is rigged, because I have money in excess of my bills, established emergency savings, etc. to throw into the market and seek a return. It‚Äôs more income that I make passively.

Eg, in a Roth IRA you can take out what you contribute at any time without penalties.  This makes a perfect emergency fund for most.

2021-04-12 22:59:48,stocks,"The problem with trading versus long term investing is the effect of compounding. Sure you can compound trades by taking profits and increasing trade sizes from those profits, but A: that carries a lot of risk, and B: it doesn't allow for the large scale compounding that comes with successful companies over time. There are additional tax implications to consider as well, as long term investing (at least 1 year+ held according to the IRS of course), is the most tax efficient way to invest outside of something like a Roth IRA.

This is a -very- cherry picked example, but take Coca-Cola. Warren Buffett has that famous quote of if you had bought a single share of Coca Cola at its IPO in 1919 at $40 a share you'd now have 220,000 shares valued at $11,700,000 when factoring in dividend reinvestment and splits. Now that is a super cherry picked example, but it does show the -potential- effect of compounding for really great companies. 

You could also argue cool cherry picked example, but that is only provided you live to 101, and that's true. Over a large enough portfolio and provided ample time though, even modest compounding can yield good results. 

That all being said I'm not saying you're wrong, you may be right, I may be crazy. But I don't think it's the worst idea to have at least a portion of your portfolio in long term holds and letting them be."

If you predict the market was going to be flat or tank because of covid (a perfectly reasonable supposition) and you threw money into market sectors you thought were going to be more resistant to losses, and you made sub-par returns as a result...  then that's fine.  You weren't right, but there was thought behind it, and you can analyze it after the fact.  If you dismiss it with, ""I made 30%,"" then it feels like an opportunity to learn has been missed.

2021-04-13 13:36:24,stocks,"edit:  I missed a key part, so I'm reposting.

- When you have a Roth 401k you can withdrawal contributions at any time according to tax code.  However, 401ks are ran by your company and in theory they can put artificial rules on it restricting this behavior, so reading the fine print helps.

- Rolling a Roth 401k to a Roth IRA follows the 5 year rule.  Your Roth IRA account has to be at least 5 years old from the first contribution.  So, open a Roth IRA, put $1 into it (or preferably $6k into it), then in 5 years after your Roth IRA has aged any money you roll from a Roth 401k to a Roth IRA can be taken out immediately.  (Keeping in mind that any contributions put into a Roth IRA directly can be taken out at any time, just rolling has the 5 year rule.)

- This 5 year rule is similar to laddering.  Eg, you can roll a normal 401k into a Roth IRA or an IRA into a Roth IRA and you have to wait 5 years before you can withdrawal the contributions.

- Roth 401ks are rare because if you're offered one you probably are making enough you shouldn't be putting into one and instead should be putting into a 401k.  That and most companies give a matching contribution on a 401k but not a Roth 401k, which is free money being thrown away.  ymmv ofc.

What you and so many fail to understand is the car is analogous to the iphone. The FSD and energy solutions are the value add and ecosystem that'll capture ridiculous value. 

Here's something to get you thinking. Go look at the largest corporations in the world. See how many are in energy. Look at what Tesla is doing with commercial energy applications. You're looking at their number one source of revenue within a decade from now. 

And yes 20%+ AVERAGE returns over the next 5 years. So that neither of us have to think, click the remind me link so we can look back at this in 5 years. Sound good?"

2021-04-12 22:28:27,stocks,Yeah. It's like letting the worry over the potential collapse of society stop you from actually continuing to function normally within that society financially/socially/legally/etc just because someone thinks it's all going to be mad max in the future.

I am currently hurting on HOL which will hopefully be merging with Astra in my SPAC portfolio it is currently somewhat fulfilling the same role as rocketlabs. It's extremely beat up almost back to 10$ I recommend if you are interested in space stocks looking into HOL - Astra, it's still a startup but it looks very promising and has an allstar management team."

Rocket Lab has already conducted 16 successful rocket launches, putting 97 payloads in orbit. Next to SpaceX, it's arguably the most successful privately owned space launch company. Astra has only launched 1 rocket and it fell short of orbital velocity, falling out of orbit. Astra does have 50 future contracts tho, so i would keep them on your watchlist"

It is profitable, owns a lot of varied consumer products, has a solid dividend, and should do okay with reopening and inflation. 

It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me that one of my low risk safety value companies has such a bad rating. Have I missed something? Still planning to hold it for 5-10 years."

2021-04-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Over $130K in Cash - Scared to Jump In I've been watching the market for about 10 months so far. I've learned quiet a bit, but I'm still a beginner of course. I have over $130K in cash and was very scared to invest until a few months ago when I put $15K in ETFs. My portfolio is doing okay. However, I'm afraid to invest more. I'm in it for the long term 5+ years.. How do I get over this fear? Any somewhat safe ETFs or stocks you recommend? Thank you!"
2021-04-12 22:24:34,stocks,"how to get over the fear? stop allowing your money to control you,it's only money..what are you scared of? you don't have to put all of that in..you should put at least 20% of it in the market..worse case scenario your life isn't much different within 130k cash and 104k cash. people like you are funny..I was like you in my late 20s..then i bought a bunch of real estate and now in my mid 30s..everything has gone up like crazy as well as stocks..so either keep allowing your money to control you or you control it.

this is why people with high paying jobs never really gain wealth..keep loving those digital numbers in the bank lolz"
2021-04-12 20:04:42,stocks,"Just keep in mind, you don't lose anything until you sell if you are down. And the stock market is designed to go up. Expand your outlook to well beyond 5 years. Nobody knows short term, we could begin a 5 year bear market tomorrow. But if you got in tomorrow, where would your initial investment be 10 years from now if you never sold and only added? Market goes up, market goes down, but overall it goes up. Most people love the ups but can't stomach the downs. Change your mindset. Short term volatility is a long term opportunity."
2021-04-12 20:35:19,stocks,"Start.   
Small. 

Smaller than that $15k, even. Leave that 15k in there, but maybe play with a grand or two in other things, until you get a true hang of the market in other areas. 

for a person like you, until you truly know what you're doing, 1% per position, TOPS. 

PLEASEEEEEEE Don't pull the typical newbie over-confidence routine and vaporize all $130k by going too heavy. 

I vaporized 20k over the past month, of $30k . 

If I hadn't done that, I would be day trading options right now, scalping, and making a metric fuck-ton of money...because NOW I have a true hang of it. 

But instead, because I went too hard one time, I'm in the market with $10k, and scalping options only 3x per week on my PDT limits, and making a lot less than I could be."
2021-04-12 20:57:25,stocks,"Put this down on paper:

* how much $130K will earn in a bank account at 1% interest
* how much $130K will earn invested in relatively safe ETFs - use 3% yield to compare

Notice that even before you figure out the numbers, you'd make 3 times as much if you invest? 

You may want to hold back some random amount - $20K - and keep that in a bank account, and invest the rest. And you may want to work with a financial advisor who is a fiduciary, meaning they work for you and keep your best interests in mind. 

Good luck. Go for it!"

But 5k in vgac, ghvi, ipoe, these are spacs that are very well funded, the merger deals announced and closed, all you have to do is wait for the mergers to finish and you're in da money. 10k in SMH etf, that's microchips, you know those things that they can't make enough of to put in nvidias and self driving cars? SMH stocks manufacture those, gonna get some good returns when looking over several years."
2021-04-13 05:00:57,stocks,"Well obviously I can't tell you what to do, and I could be wrong. I have about the same amount of money in reserve, and I will never invest more than 10%-12% of my total cash reserves. I set aside in my mind about 5% for ""dips"" or other buying opportunities. It isn't fear per se, I have no problem on red days or buying on red days. Of course if I could go back in time I would put about 10% into market indexes and about 5% into stocks I like, but I'm slowly building my way to that at the moment anyway. Everybody is different, that's just me, but I just can't see myself committing my entire bankroll."
2021-04-13 05:41:37,stocks,"Not sure if you'll see this, but I would suggest this:

1. Make sure you have a few months salary uninvested (savings account with interest) to cover any unforseeable costs

2. Invest mainly in index funds

3. If you want to get into individual stocks, make sure to read up about the market and try to only have around 10-20% of your investments in individual stocks. Lower in the beginning as you are learning."
2021-04-13 06:11:32,stocks,"Start with ETFs they are usually the most stable.  Also don't just put it all in at once. Maybe put in 10k at a time 6k into a roth ira and 4k into a brokerage account.  Vanguard or fidelity are both pretty good options I think fidelity has free ETFs now but do your research. 

Also look at stable businesses like AT&T, ticker symbol T, and maybe 3M ticker MMM (creative right?)."

Don‚Äôt invest it all at once. Start with just $5,000 or $10,000 the first month and wait. 

Get your list of what you want, by 5 shares or so as you see little dips and slowly average in. You might have some swings up and down but it helps to avoid buying completely at the top potentially.

That‚Äôs the beauty of zero commission fees now."

2021-04-13 14:11:26,stocks,"I had the same and lost most of it on one bad play. Watch tons of videos.  Start with TD ameritrade or fidelity videos.  Do some paper trading.  You seem like you don‚Äôt want the risk. Look at dividend stocks for starts.  Apple, Att, Deere, even Johnson and Johnson. 
Could invest in.  Microsoft, FB, Google, Netflix, Amazon.  Nvidia is another solid one.  Also buy stocks in companies you like.  As far as funds, check out ark and vanguard.  

Before you do any of that though learn about RSI and MACD charts at a minimum.  Learn what panic selling means and avoid it at all costs!!!!   

Also learn how to place orders ie stop loss, trail stop, etc.  learn as much as you can before buying a single stock.  You can learn a lot in about 40-80 hrs.  Also use a notebook/journal. Stocks go up and down and history repeats itself.  The journal helps you remember the history.  Trust me.

NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise makes it possible for 3D production teams ‚Äî which are often large, diverse in skills and geographically dispersed ‚Äî to work seamlessly together on complex projects. Rather than requiring in-person meetings or exchanging and iterating on massive files, designers, artists and reviewers can work simultaneously in a virtual world from anywhere, on any device.

NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise has been in early evaluations with some of the world‚Äôs most sophisticated design teams at companies like BMW Group, Foster + Partners and WPP. It follows the launch three months ago of an open beta for individuals, which has been downloaded by nearly 17,000 users.

Fallout 3, NV and 4 were all very well received and there‚Äôs tons of potential in that franchise (I‚Äôm biased here because it‚Äôs by far my favourite Zenimax/Bethesda franchise). 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on Doom/Wolfenstein/Dishonoured which have all been wildly successful in their own right.

2021-04-13 00:21:13,stocks,"I personally won‚Äôt go near ARK funds for a number of reasons. The main ones being: 

-	Unproven winner - ya, the returns are undeniable. Lately, and then they weren‚Äôt. But look at the entire life of the ARK funds and ask yourself ‚Äúif she‚Äôs so great how come she hasn‚Äôt been so great until fairly recently and has she proven that she‚Äôs great vs just being lucky and marketing that lucky break or two very well?‚Äù The answer - she‚Äôs a great marketer with one idea repackaged a million times over, and that run it‚Äôs course. The major gains are behind you at this point in the funds‚Äô lifecycles. 

-	Inflows not investments - the source of most of the upside for all ARK funds is new client inflows, not investments, not returns, not reinvestments by the fund itself, they come from inflows. That‚Äôs it. Which means that the tipping point where outflows or stagnation in new client interest becomes critically dangerous to the solvency of the funds is very very low. Marketing and attracting new business to the fund aren‚Äôt just good smart business practice in this case, they ARE the business in this case. To a Ponzi scheme level of dependency. 

-	Tesla - Cathie Wood had one idea, and she went way too overweight on it with everything ever since. Just buy Tesla if you want to buy into a bubble while avoiding the (very expensive fee-loaded) middleman scam on top. 

Etc etc etc 

TL/DR
-	It‚Äôs a Ponzi scheme - Literally. Not figuratively. Not as hyperbole. Literally."

2021-04-13 10:45:15,stocks,Goals right there. Good job.
2021-04-13 00:27:02,stocks,"Nope, but this advice isn't unique to Mr. Ramsey.   With a bit of disagreement over whether one should take the 401k match before or after starting to retire debt it's pretty much the same among most personal finance advisors.   See r/personalfinance, and the resources over there in the sidebar.   

One other note is that I find the desire to start investing before you have an emergency fund, or alternatively with your emergency fund troubling.   It's not uncommon for the stock market to tank at the same time as the job market dries up.   One really wants to ensure they have the resources they need to survive even if they lose their job and the market tanks at the same time.   This emergency fund is an insurance policy and any loss of earnings can be looked at as the premium on the policy.

As a counterpoint, my struggle recently has been to bring myself to reduce the size of my emergency fund now that I'm at a stage in my life where I don't need as much savings as I did when I was younger and had fewer assets.   Now the house is paid off, and I have a significant amount in the Taxable brokerage account, there are very few things that could come up that I couldn't just handle.   I don't need the size of emergency fund I once had since to survive all I need is to be able to pay for the electric bill, and buy some ramen noodles (if I really had to)."

2021-04-12 22:41:28,stocks,"It‚Äôs so regime-specific though. Other regimes didn‚Äôt have low rates and low taxes. Indices sector compositions were radically different, with different gross, operating, and net margins. Earnings are just going to look different. It‚Äôs really tough to compare 80s bull market to today‚Äôs bull (as fun as it is to try). I think if you‚Äôre betting against growth (not growth factor), you really shouldn‚Äôt be investing at all.

Ned Davis Research published an interesting paper called ‚ÄúUsing excess CAPE yield to improve portfolio returns‚Äù‚Äîunfortunately it looks like behind a paywall‚Äîwhere they showed forward equity market return estimates using various valuation methodologies (correlation to forward 10-year return shown in parentheses):
	1.	Fed Model (28%)
	2.	P/E ratio (56%)
	3.	CAPE ratio (61%)
	4.	Excess CAPE Yield over Treasuries (72%)
	5.	Excess CAPE Yield over Aaa Corporates (73%)
¬†
Based on this model, the return forecast is 16% for the IT sector and 3.6% for the Energy sector.
¬†
NDR conducted in-sample and out-of-sample backtests of a sector selection strategy that invested in the three GICS sectors with the highest forecasted 10-year returns. These backtests outperformed the S&P 500 by 300bps and 350bps since 1993 and 2012, respectively.
¬†
The current three sectors with the highest 10-year return forecasts are IT, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary (all growth sectors).
¬†
It's interesting that even after the massive outperformance we've seen from growth/tech, according to this model, that area of the market is still the most attractive from a valuation standpoint. Their intrinsic value has most likely gotten more realized at a quicker pace, but I still think there‚Äôs plenty of runway for good ideas."

If you're buying hundreds of different kinds of stock in different volumes, you don't have a 50\50 chance of beating the market.

An index fund like the s&p gives you 500 companies, you'll get all the gains those companies make, which is around 7% per year after accounting for inflation. 

A managed fund has to not only beat that 7%, they have to do it by enough of a margin to cover the costs you incur by investing with them, which can be up to 2%. 

Very, very few mutual funds manage to do this. Hedge funds are the only funds that routinely outperform the market, by little more than 1% on average."

2021-04-12 22:25:53,stocks,"Not literal cash... like a cash position in an account...

What exactly do you mean by ‚Äúbanks‚Äù? Investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Bros shutdown in 2008 because they couldn‚Äôt cover their positions (a number of things contributed to it, but in the end they basically ran out of cash). But those aren‚Äôt banks like Bank of America or wherever you do your normal banking at. Dodd-Frank ensures that investment banking operations are completely separated from retail banking, and FDIC further insures your deposits in traditional banking accounts up to a certain limit. 

(SIPC can offer some protection to investors though in the event your broker-dealer goes bankrupt)

Inflation is just the rise in prices of a broad basket of goods and services, and it typically increases when there is a lot of cash circulating in the economy. So what happens to inflation in the event of the economy collapsing kinda depends on why it collapsed. 

Normally, the fed doesn‚Äôt really care about the stock market, but rather their dual mandate of price stability and maximizing employment. They are able to affect outcomes in those areas typically through the open market operations (think buying and selling US treasuries) which can either take huge amounts of cash out of circulation or put huge amount of cash into circulation. They can also affect interest rates by setting reserve requirements or setting the discount rate (but this could make things messy if changed frequently) and also set economic expectations through the communications they frequently put out.

Edit: BUT a lot of what they do ends up being reflected in the markets of tradeable securities (obviously very directly in the bond markets, less so in commodities markets, and more indirectly in the stock market). If they‚Äôre pumping cash into the economy and interest rates are low, then that should lead banks to increase their lending, which should increase the economic output of those companies (gotta have money to make money!) and would therefore raise investors sentiment in a specific company‚Äôs future profitability (reflected by share price moving up). There is definitely a huge concern with inflation the longer this continues but they‚Äôve done a good job of keeping inflation on their target rate. 

There is some major criticism in the way they measure inflation. Many say that CPI doesn‚Äôt reflect the true inflation rate. But I‚Äôd counter that maximizing employment is more important to economic well-being than inflation unless inflation truly gets out of hand."
2021-04-13 16:20:32,stocks,"Oh, I didn't think about fees.

I was thinking 50/50 because the stock market is essentially a zero-sum equation (isn't it?), for every looser there's a winner, therefore you've got a 50/50 chance of picking a winning fund.

But I don't know jack about investing, so there's a 50/50 üòâ chance I'm wrong."

You‚Äôre falling into the fed trap of believing annual inflation of 2.5% is good and the ‚Äúmost economists‚Äù angle is a stretch.

But if it has growth ahead then you should keep the stock if the fundamentals hasn't changed.

My view is that in the long term it will be worth more and now is the best time to DCA the stock While people still dont understand the business and are saying stuff like it is going to 0 or going to 15-17. Reminds me of TSLA a couple years ago."

This is my belief and I invested in this company with conviction. The ups definitely make me happy. The downs will definitely get sigh out of me, but I remember why I invested in it in the first place, and then I carry on with my day."

If you're expecting a steady decline, I'd say buy a put at a strike closer to the money. If you're expecting a steep drop right after earnings but sideways movement til then, I'd buy the option closer to earnings date. As it is, if it trades sideways, you're burning a lot of time value so if the steep drop doesn't come you'll be out of luck.

2021-04-13 11:06:46,stocks,"If anyone is curious:

Good morning,
 
Thanks for reaching out to Robinhood regarding the upcoming COIN IPO. We understand orders around IPOs can be a little complex and I would be happy to clarify.
 
Robinhood typically allows our customers to place limit orders to purchase shares of IPO's on their opening day around 8:00 AM EST.  
 
Keep in mind that these orders cannot be executed and will remain pending until the stock officially begins trading on our platform and your limit price is met. You may be able to see the company listed on Robinhood prior to the IPO date and be able to add it to you lists, you will not be able to place an order until the actual IPO date.
 
We do our best to accurately process these types of events in a timely manner and will work to get COIN trading as soon as we're able to.  
 
Please be aware that orders placed on the day of an IPO may not always fill due to increased trading volatility. Stocks on the day of their IPOs are often more volatile than mature stocks. Prices may change quickly and your order may not be filled even if your order's limit price is at or above the displayed price.
 
If you need to change your limit price, you'll need to first cancel your order then reset your price. To cancel a pending limit order: 
View your pending orders by tapping on ""History"" in your account menu. 
Tap the order you wish to cancel to view more information. 
Tap the red ""Cancel Order"" button. 
Let me know if you have any questions--I‚Äôm happy to help.
 
Sincerely,
Mark"

Which computer parts did they sell out of? The fact that you‚Äôre not mentioning it was the RTX 30XX series cards in a year where semiconductors are in a deep drought and it‚Äôs a highly sought after product is making your entire point suspect. The local bodega would have people around the block if they had those in stock, that has nothing to do with GameStop.

I'm not sure but it seems that the problem was in their files, however, I'd recommend you to use [https://www.import2.com/csv](https://www.import2.com/csv) tutorials if you have the same issues with this particular screener. Not sure, but the main issue described by users was that the value in the csv files here may mix, as well as the commas disappear. Takes some time to fix I guess.

Tradingview is also a great stock screener, and you have here all the features you need. I'm currently using it and must say that it doesn't have any issues with exporting csv. Have been following markets with it for quite a long time and analyzed a lot of data. So, I think you can try both these apps and then decide which is better for you."

2021-04-13 03:12:41,stocks,"‚ÄúDuring March 1‚ÄìDecember 31, 2020, state-issued mask mandates applied in 2,313 (73.6%) of the 3,142 U.S. counties. Mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease (p = 0.02) in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 1‚Äì20 days after implementation and decreases of 1.1, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.8 percentage points 21‚Äì40, 41‚Äì60, 61‚Äì80, and 81‚Äì100 days, respectively, after implementation (p<0.01 for all) (Table 1) (Figure). Mask mandates were associated with a 0.7 percentage point decrease (p = 0.03) in daily COVID-19 death growth rates 1‚Äì20 days after implementation and decreases of 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.9 percentage points 21‚Äì40, 41‚Äì60, 61‚Äì80, and 81‚Äì100 days, respectively, after implementation (p<0.01 for all). Daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period.‚Äù


If you go back and look, the daily growth percentage was between 6-12% during early part, dropped to 3-6% during the summer months as expected, and 10+% when it got cold again during that reference period. So I think your analysis is flawed right away if you‚Äôre using 3% as your baseline. 

Let‚Äôs not worry about who‚Äôs wrong here. Let‚Äôs keep it simple. We ruined the lives of millions of Americans, sent the suicide rate to the moon in 2020 (more than .5%...), destroyed the education of our children, and crashed our economy over a virus that presents only mild symptoms in 99.6% of confirmed cases to POSSIBLY prevent <1.6% (at VERY best over a 20 day period in warm weather or .5% on average) of growth of that virus??? The margin of error conveniently omitted from this report (typically 3%) would allow the possibility that we caused all of this destruction for a 0% success rate against a virus that has a 3% death rate overall IF you include seniors over 70 and those with comorbidities who should certainly take precautions. We should be talking about a decrease of  50-75-95% to say that wearing masks had a significant impact. Destroy families for 1-2% possibility of a decreased chance of getting a virus? I believe the saying goes ‚Äúthe juice ain‚Äôt worth the squeeze‚Äù. Check out the Amish in Lancaster PA who just kept going to church. They were not killed off and COVID is in the history books for them. 

That‚Äôs just the math. We‚Äôre not even touching on motivation to keep everyone scared in this conversation. However I do wonder if Mr. Bezoz donates to governors of lock down states like Michigan or free states like Florida. Hmmm.... different rabbit hole. Sorry."

If you do your DD properly and are convinced in your decision enough to risk money on a expectation that what your betting on it will increase in value then the benefit you could get with this type of investment could be a positive event...  Absolutely you can be wrong and things can change along the way...  You are taking a risk and that risk is AMPLIFIED with these securities...    Every investment has a risk...  These simply bring you to the end game sooner whatever that may be...   If your in the market your there for a reason...   You can choose to invest in QQQ for a one to one movement based on the underlying index, OR, you can invest 3X LESS capital on TQQQ which is expected to provide 3X the movement of the underlying index...  If you loose your have less to loose...   If you gain you could gain 3X your expected return percentage from what you have expected of with QQQ...    Make a decision and go with it, or not...

If it‚Äôs only 1 week worth of work, then sure throw it into call options for 2023 and say ‚ÄúF it‚Äù. But if you are conservative, want a steady return in a stock you‚Äôre bullish on and this $3,000 is a few months of savings, I would go with shares.

Honestly, either way is great. I‚Äôve seen both work out for people as long as the market has been bullish and the stock they purchased went on a big winning streak.

So with call options, you do have more risk and more reward. But a lot more ahas to go in your favor than not. With shares, worst case worst, you hold longer. So much less risk with some reward as well.

At the end of the day it‚Äôs up to you. As a long term investor that‚Äôs been in the markets for about 10 years. I would go 50/50.

2021-04-12 20:38:31,stocks,"These cars have less parts than any other auto vehicle specifically for the purposes to keep the number of moving parts down which in return reduces costs and replacement work, which translates into cost savings. 

My last luxury car, Jag XJ I had for 13 years, this page would be filled with numbers for what I spent on maintenance and general upkeep. Several friends with other high end vehicles, same story, we compare costs of repair bills with each other. 

Sure there are a few major components that may have some high replacement costs, but doesn't it cost 5k+ to replace a motor? Or 4k for a tranny? Or thousands if the rear differential goes out? Not saying they are guaranteed to go out, but likewise the same could be said with the electric motors in my car. 

Simply put, these cars are not actually as complex as people make it seem, I think it's because there is not really a big aftermarket following where people are doing crazy stuff other than like Rich Rebuilds on YT.

I may very have been lucky, i've been on the Tesla forums long enough to see that there has been some tough things to deal with as an owner. What's interesting though, is that I also saw the same thing in the Jaguar, Jeep, and Corvette forums that i've been on for years, you know, owners complaining about this or that.

So while obviously I couldn't know the costs of every single vehicle for maintenance and repairs, in closing, I can say that I have been more impressed with the Tesla and the service department, and org as a whole, more so than any other brand I've ever given money to."
2021-04-13 18:06:05,stocks,"Coinbase just released (Apr 13, 2021) an updated fully diluted shares outstanding: 261.3 million.

2021-04-13 18:06:53,stocks,"Says 196M on here :

Coinbase, the American cryptocurrency trading giant, has set a reference price for its direct listing at¬†$250 per share. According to the company‚Äôs most recent SEC filing, it has a fully-diluted share count of 261.3 million, giving the company a valuation of $65.3 billion. Using a simple share count of 196,760,122 provided in its most recent S-1/A filing, Coinbase would be worth a slimmer $49.2 billion.
Regardless of which share count is used to calculate the company‚Äôs valuation, it‚Äôs new worth is miles above its final private price set in 2018 when the company¬†was worth $8 billion.
Immediate chatter following the company‚Äôs direct listing reference price was that the price could be low. While Coinbase will not suffer usual venture capital censure if its shares quickly appreciate as it is not selling stock in its flotation, it would still be slightly humorous if its set reference price was merely a reference to an overly conservative estimate of its worth.
Its private backers are in for a bonanza either way. Around four years ago in 2017 Coinbase was worth just $1.6 billion, according to Crunchbase data. For investors in that round, let alone its earlier fundraises, the valuation implied by a $250 per-share price represents a multiple of around 40x from the price that they paid.
The Coinbase direct listing was turbocharged recently when the company provided a¬†first-look at its Q1 2021 performance. As TechCrunch reported at the time, the company‚Äôs recent growth was impressive, with revenue scaling from $585.1 million in Q4 2020, to $1.8 billion in the first three months of this year. The new numbers set an already-hot company‚Äôs public debut on fire.
Place your bets now concerning where Coinbase might open, and how high its value may rise. It‚Äôs going to be quite the show."
2021-04-13 18:09:27,stocks,"Price alone is not enough information. You should also multiply that by the number of shares outstanding to get a market cap for the company.

On Apr 13, 2021, Coinbase released their shares outstanding: 261.3M. Using the above price range, gives Coinbase market cap of $91.4B to $104B.

The delivery angle is definitely a longshot, but it's potentially more interesting for them since they're not handling the actual delivery and can pass along costs. They also have a better/more distributed footprint close to residences (IIRC >50% of U.S. population w/in 1mi) and disproportionately sell junk food and other vices (e.g. beer) that people will pay a premium to have delivered.

In the less impactful, but still interesting category they've also made it easy to schedule deliveries to parks and other landmarks. I'm not really counting on delivery being a money maker though."

If you buy other companies' funds Schwab has a fee ($45 I think) plus a minimum investment amount. It's a $1 min. if you buy one of Schwab's funds. If you decide to go with ETFs, you can trade any ETF with no fee. But, Schwab's ETFs have a lower cost per share, and since you can't buy partial ETF shares, you'll be able to buy similar funds but need less cash to do so. So, VTI is over $200/share, whereas SCHB is around $100.

2021-04-13 03:42:24,stocks,"Odd, in benchmarks, Nuance Speech Recognition is much better than Fluency whichi had a more primative engine. However, Speech Reco is organic in some sense, so many variables may affect it's accuracy including your specific auto correction options, how you speech, prosody, pronounciation, etc. Also, I believe Dragon requires training, unless you use the cloud based version which can have human transcription correction as well."
2021-04-13 04:13:06,stocks,"Microsoft Speech Recognition is built for general dictation and their language models tested against very specific data sets.  I wouldn't say Micorsoft Speech is miles and miles better - both perform closely in a real world scenario, but Nuance speech reco is still available on-premise and private cloud versus Microsoft which is entirely cloud based. So for government and other high security applications, many still prefer to use Nuance since it's self-contained. Not only that, Nuance speech can be tuned for a particular customer through custom ontologies which I don't think Microsoft supports.

But utlimately I think the two companies are synergetic - Nuance will provide the technology, experience, marketshare,  Microsoft the money, R&D resources, and cloud hosting capabilities."
2021-04-13 03:57:47,stocks,"The ultimate goal is to have passive speech recongition and understanding in a EHR scenario - i.e. as the physician talks to a paitent, the system will understand the context and automatically log the data to the record - an intelligent auto-fill .

As for standard dictation, it's a learned art - once you know how to do it, it's much faster and why lawyers and medical professionals prefer it. Most people probably need a couple hundred hours of practice before they can be truly proficient (it's like learning to type right).

But for Nuance and Microsoft, there is also the Enterprise space - Nuance is heavily used in contact centers to automate IVRs and other self-service applications. There have been many new competitors in the space including Amazon and Google as well as traditional contact center platforms, so Nuance needed Microsoft's heft to push forward on the Enterprise space.

The two companies will probably mesh well together - Nuance provides a lot of technologies, experience, people, and marketshare that Microsoft does not have. Microsoft will provide the funds and resources to take the technology to the next-generation."

2021-04-12 21:16:10,stocks,The margin is your money. The margin loan is their money.
2021-04-13 11:29:49,stocks,"I'm sorry to drag it out but if you can elaborate once more - Investopedia states margin ""is borrowing money from a broker"".  That sounds like a loan to me that has to be paid back?  I understand margin accounts usually have 2:1 buying power, and when you start going beyond your 1:1 cash then you are technically starting to use their money in your buying power?"
2021-04-13 15:10:29,stocks,"I'm not sure which investopedia page you're looking at.

It's very common to mistake margin debt for margin in casual discussion.

Margin is the part you own outright. Margin debt is the part you borrow. You borrow ""on margin"" meaning against the marginable equity in your account. In documents brokers will be even more clear and call it ""margin equity"" just so people don't claim they thought it was the other way around.

Example: You add $10000 margin to your new account, all in cash (it could be marginable stock, meaning stock of high enough quality that it can be used as collateral). You buy $20000 stock. You now have $10000 in margin debt, $10000 in margin, and $20000 in assets (you can't add assets and margin together, or you'll double-count; your margin is your assets less your debt). You can also say you have 50% margin because your margin is half your assets. That's usually the most you can buy because if you took on more debt the percentage would fall below the initial margin requirement.

If the stock drops by 10%, you now have $18000 in assets, but you still have $10000 in margin debt, leaving $8000 in margin, or 44.4%.

But say the stock had dropped 40%. The debt doesn't drop, so of the $12000 assets that are left, $10000 are debt and only $2000 or 16.6% are margin, and you are below the typical maintenance margin requirement of 30%. You will get a margin call and be given a short time to add margin to bring your account back up to the maintenance requirement (or better), and if you can't or won't, then your broker sells your assets and uses the proceeds to pay down your debt, then leaves the balance in the account. If the proceeds won't cover the debt, then the balance will be negative. The 30% requirement usually leaves enough that that doesn't happen, but not always."
