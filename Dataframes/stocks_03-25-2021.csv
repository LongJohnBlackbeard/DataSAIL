03/25/2021,stocks,I think you're spot on.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Dividend stock is only superior choice when the company is a growth company and (theoretically) increases in value. 

It is otherwise typically a vehicle to keep your money where it is and live off of interest (Provided its in blue chip dividend yielders and they don't drop the dividend)

I'm currently experimenting myself and buying prospective dividend stocks that are likely to continue growth and some expected to hold where they are for the foreseeable future. I have a lot of financial sector dividends, which are expected to hover around the same price for years and years. If they do and I can hold them for 20+ years, they would earn in interest what I initially spent on all of them in the first place. Keep in mind that's a huge if."
03/25/2021,stocks,Would you still buy this company at the current price if they had no dividend ?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Question is if the company is in debt to pay dividends. IMHO it would be more healthy for the company to pay less or no dividends and prioritize its situation. Otherwise, if the company goes south and the stock price plummets, that's the value of the shares gone."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hmmm... this one is not really a growth company, I'm afraid."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, but perhaps on a more long scheme. Like, buy and forget.

I mean, at some point the price *should* match their financials, but for some reason I just see the price dropping month after month due to negative sentiment. So I'm resorting to dividend in case this situation continues and I want to exit sooner to pursue some other opportunity."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You want the dividend to be a sure thing where you're never second guessing it or wondering when the dividend will drop. For that, you will need to invest in your version of blue chip stocks (Unless you have a lot of faith in the American ones or prefer them, etc) That's just an opinion, not financial advice.

Honestly, if you're doing prospective, you're probably better off doing the non-dividend stuff like Tesla or cryptocurrencies (or anything that doesn't pay a dividend). Dividend stocks aren't really built for short-term activities since you need to hold them for months to get the dividend. Also why you should be weary of cheap stocks that have ultra high dividends."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Dividend plus a out of the money covered call on it might help protect further downside if you are willing to hold it for a long while. 

You can always DCA in too."
03/25/2021,stocks,$IQ is a good play too ... probably go up 15% really short term
03/25/2021,stocks,"Solid balance sheet and FWD PE. 90% institutional ownership to boot. May open a position this week. Currently long AOSL, MU and COHU."
03/25/2021,stocks,About the amount it takes to buy a refrigerator
03/25/2021,stocks,"a few hours. I am an individual investor, and I invest in companies I believe in. If I haven't heard of a company, and dont know what it does, I don't invest in it. It is why I missed out on tesla, every EV company, palantir, nio and all the other new tech stocks, but also why I made a fortune on apple when I was 14 and a few other very good long term investments, and I haven't lost my shirt"
03/25/2021,stocks,500-1000 hours is way too excessive. By the time you’re done you might have missed the boat on a good price
03/25/2021,stocks,"500-1000 hours...... If spending so much time on DD before making a investment, I'd expect zero down days.

Be depressing to do all that DD and fail to stay green."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It depends on the level of your conviction, margin of safety, and a ton of other factors like how complex the business is.

If it is a small company with an easy to understand business model that has a trend nobody else is seeing and it is trading at 20% of what you think it would be worth based on your high level assumptions, you might just jump in quickly with a smaller bet. Then as time passes you might add or reduce as you get more information and they report new quarters.

If the company is more complex or you are going to put a lot of your portfolio in it, then it is prudent to spend more time on the research. If you follow a stock for 10 years, then 500 hours on the stock is more like 1 hour per week. But your mileage may very."
03/25/2021,stocks,"500-1k hours?! No. 

Even at net $4/hour that would be $4000 of time invested. That much research isn't really useful in the skill-building sense, and I like my do-nothing time more than that. Also, am I actually adding $4k of gains by doing that? Surely it will lead to either a yes or a no - and a no means doing another 1k hours on a different company. 

So: nowhere near. There's people whose job it is to do that. They're called analysts, and they actually get directly paid for it. For a stock I like and want to take up a proper position in, I will read the news and opinion pieces on a stock, look at its price history and maybe P/E history, look at analysts opinions and forecasts and the sort of stats/info you get on Yahoo finance (including recent earnings and forecast next one). That doesn't take long. Not more than an hour at a good reading speed. Will keep an eye on the news feed for stocks in my portfolio, but not read every item - mainly skim the headlines. Keep in mind these are solid companies though, not diversifying into weed, and I probably thought about buying that stock in the first place after reading general market news.

For a YOLO sort of play, I am normally pretty low conviction, only a small bet on it, etc. Not much research, not much conviction in it's stability/upwards motion, not much money. But that's gambles. If you're trying to make serious money off that sort of play a lot more DD would be justified, but individual solid stocks are volatile enough for me in our current market."
03/25/2021,stocks,"10 to 15 mins? Maybe an additional 10 minutes reading various write ups and articles on the company. 

ETFs and index funds? 2 mins. Essentially what's the expense ratio and if it's an ETF, the holdings 



All this excessive time spent on underwater 4D upside down Deep blue chess analysis on individual stocks or index/ETFs by retail simpletons is not going to give an edge or reveal new information. Just ride the bull market. I have a low 7 figure portfolio with ~70% in individual stocks. Doing just fine riding the bull market since 2005."
03/25/2021,stocks,I just throw all my money into texas instruments. Great dividends and great growth.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It is up to your broker and type of your account.    
There is no one rule, my broker has 5% of the stock price calculated on a yearly bases, paid monthly.    
They do not allow to go short on stocks in risk category D (GME is now in D category).  
This is different from someone who has proffesional account with massive portofolio value,     
You need to check with your broker, as the price is different between different brokers and account types.    
If you are wondering how much is MC paying, it is probably bussines secret, and it can't be found out."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Your broker pass through the cost from the lender to you. 
If you want to short 1 share of apple stock from let’s say RH...well RH essentially calls up a prime broker like JPM. JPM can lend you that share they charge a borrow fee. JPM charges RH 3MonthFedOpen+80bps. Today that rate is at 0.10, so RH pays 0.90%. Naturally RH charges you 1.20% for their effort. You pay 1.20/360 =0.003% for 1 day.  This rate tend to reset monthly. Next month the rate may jump to 0.20 then next month now you pay 1.3% annualized. 

It all depends on what you’re trying to borrow. AAPL as a blue chip is likely most liquid so A prime broker charges the lowest. Even if you go to a stock on the russell2000 the borrow rate jumps from FedOpen+80 to FedOpen+120. 
Now if you are trying to short something that everyone wants to short or they just don’t issue so many shares (hard to borrow list) then the cost of borrow is even higher. 

The true details on how it’s calculated is not public. It’s the contract between your broker and the various prime brokers. Each broker may have different rates. I would imagine if you are with Merril (they are their own PB) borrow rate would be cheaper."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thank you, for reference who is your broker? The percentage of stock price formula is certainly not uniform, since at least through fidelity and interactive brokers, the percentage is variable.  Business secret is exactly what I'm thinking, but am I wrong to think that lack of transparency on this rate indicates either incompetence or corruption?"
03/25/2021,stocks,well it depends on how many stocks there are in the inventory available to be borrowed. And they use whatever formula to determine the borrow cost. Supply and demand. It is not a static number. So it can change daily (or can change throughout the day too iirc)
03/25/2021,stocks,There is no consistent stock that has 6.5 percent div yield or high and high growth. If you find one let me know
03/25/2021,stocks,"I like REITs. But I’m not that smart

[REIT](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/10/real-estate-investment-trust-reit.asp)"
03/25/2021,stocks,Iron Mountain (IRM) has a decent dividend and the price stays pretty stable.
03/25/2021,stocks,theres no such thing as a high growth and high dividend stock.  companies pay dividends as their growth levels off as a way to continue rewarding stockholders
03/25/2021,stocks,Use your broker’s stock screening tool then.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I like T, dividend yield is at 6.94. Great cash flow, really turning the business around with selling parts of DirectTV. They are investing heavily into 5g and also their streaming service HBO Max. Overall I like the stock."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I also tend to like REITs for this, I’ve used STWD Starwood in the past to great return"
03/25/2021,stocks,Oil. VST EXXON BP
03/25/2021,stocks,Search any where you can for blue chip stocks.Any major large company.You have to stay in them long.
03/25/2021,stocks,"look up joseph carlson on youtube. He has been doing a weekly documentation of his dividend growth portfolio for the last 2 years (or so) .. It is quite informative and there is alot of videos breaking down his decisions on why he invests in certain companies

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbta0n8i6Rljh0obO7HzG9A](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbta0n8i6Rljh0obO7HzG9A)"
03/25/2021,stocks,BGS
03/25/2021,stocks,"REITs can have good yields, but their dividends can never be qualified dividends, that means you will always pay taxes on them as if they are straight income"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yea there is, because of covid.

Su is what you're looking for op"
03/25/2021,stocks,Good dividends but zero growth
03/25/2021,stocks,Do banks or utilities have the same thing?
03/25/2021,stocks,No not generally. REITs have a special legal structure that allows pass-through income (no taxation at the company level). Normal C-corps have that and then we get taxed on the dividend as shareholders.
03/25/2021,stocks,"the one good thing right now is REITs currently get the 20% pass through deduction, so even though they are taxed as ordinary, that does help  


keep in mind that biden is likely going to eliminate that  


also note, 100% of my roth IRA is in REITs"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah I’m the same way. 100% Roth in REITs. Don’t want to deal with the eventual phase-out honestly. The QBI deduction is nice, though, for people who want to hold them in taxable. Good point."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I love REITs, just currently my income means it makes absolutely no sense to invest in them in my portfolio anymore.

&#x200B;

If you make over 40k (which makes all your qualified dividends taxed at 15%) but under 160k which is where the tax bracket jumps from 24 to 32 %, it still isnt a bad idea.. if you are taxed at 24% but get the 20% pass through, you are only taxed at 19.2% which is not bad at all (if you are in the 22% bracket you are taxed at 17.6% including the 20% pass through) ...

&#x200B;

Be wary though ! As I said before, if/when the QBI (20% business deduction) is eliminated, REITs and real estate in general are going to be hit hard imo. It will be significantly less attractive for investors."
03/25/2021,stocks,"When the stock price reaches your cost basis price, would that be a good time to sell? That way you're not stuck holding bags?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"The US is one of only countries where stock prices have always gone up in the long term. Look at major indices of other countries. It is possible to buy at a high and not recover for 20 years. Is our market always going to be better than theirs? Maybe, but it's not guaranteed."
03/25/2021,stocks,"If the lesson you learned is just hold on to stocks no matter what new information or circumstances come to light, then im sorry you haven't learned any valuable lesson. If you plan on holding those incredible stocks for decades then you shouldn't have a problem waiting for a better buy in like during these inevitable red days, instead of buying it when its bloated to shit during a massive bull rally."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Every situation is unique. Sometimes it’s better to cut your losses. Sometimes they’re not actually losses, given the right opportunity."
03/25/2021,stocks,Why would I take the advice from someone who’s down over 30%? Just saying.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You bought at that price, do you like the stock or not.  Investing has become this momentum based game.  

Buy stocks you feel are going to be transformative, hold these stocks through their bumps, buy more when they dip too much.   Own a bit of diversity so when one jumps and the other dips, you can  sell the jump on one and buy the dip of the other.

Wait, be patient, don't catch a falling knife, but don't sell the knife right as hits the floor.  Good luck."
03/25/2021,stocks,Only if you don't believe in the company
03/25/2021,stocks,Or not recover at all. Look at Japan.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I never said to just hold positions blindly. I'm just saying to not get disheartened when things go south for a month or two if you have genuine, well-informed faith that the stock will ACTUALLY be an incredible hold for years to come. But of course, you shouldn't just buy shit because it's popular.

And yeah, that's another important lesson: Don't buy high, and wait to buy low. Stocks don't always go up, so you shouldn't worry that much about missing the boat. And if you do miss the boat, there will always be other plays."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Learn by example. Sometimes what to do, sometimes what ***not*** to do."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Because from the lessons I've learned, I'm confident that I'll be up over 20% a year from now. 

Also, my background should be of little concern to you if what I'm telling you is still accurate. I didn't just pull this out of my ass, and this is similar advice that many others have told me who are MUCH more successful than me on the market. If you have a problem with my advice, I'd like you to tell me exactly what you disagree with."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Right but from what ive seen, so many people here just blindly buy stocks without taking into consideration market conditions or if theres already been a run. Think about when you bought the stocks, what level was the SPX at, was there a market sell off happening, was it a green day? Did the stock just have a nice positive run? Who do you think is happier right now, the people who waited to buy apple at 116 a couple weeks ago or someone who bought it at 123 a couple days ago? ""But how could anyone know that apple would drop that low""? Everything drops in a sell off when volatility is high. Hopefully you internalize your last point, and keep making smart buys and dont get attached to any stock no matter what."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes. And ideally, it's better to set the example than BE the example (i.e., don't be who I've been LOL), but either way, it's the lesson that counts."
03/25/2021,stocks,Up over 20%? The current evidence suggests that is unlikely.
03/25/2021,stocks,"We'll see if my buys are smart several months from now haha. I'm definitely on the look out to make sure that my bullish sentiments currently on my positions will continue to be valid here on out. 

Going off of what you said, I've also learned that, just because you like something now, it doesn't mean that you should buy immediately. For instance, the market has been trading sideways for the past few weeks. If one saw this and waited, then maybe they would've been able to buy the dip in the past few days. Too many people here act as if buying the dip means buying it all at once, when maybe that wasn't even the dip or the price will continue dipping."
03/25/2021,stocks,"And what do you have to prove? If you're so sure that I'll continue to be a bad investor, then check in with me in a year and we'll see. It always feels great to prove condescending people wrong."
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m just making simple judgements based on the data presented. That’s all.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Alright. Well, only time will tell.

Maybe 20% is being too confident. My only goal is to break even a year from now."
03/25/2021,stocks,Not the kind of BBW I’m after tho
03/25/2021,stocks,Have you ever been to a build a Bear shop? It's a breading ground for snotty kids before a pandemic. Hard pass.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Problem are these liberal moms who think everything is dirty,  so they don't do this stuff anymore."
03/25/2021,stocks,Those are crazy numbers during a pandemic
03/25/2021,stocks,"I did a quick lookback of past financials.

[https://docoh.com/company/1113809/BBW/financials](https://docoh.com/company/1113809/BBW/financials)

And then merely compared the stock prices then to current. 

Past financials, while shrinking, look strong. So what's the target price, $10?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Line had to be a mile long at two malls I’ve gone to. Fricken insane
03/25/2021,stocks,I think that makes it even better lol
03/25/2021,stocks,I loved it as a kid. Online aspect could be huge too. Expensive and always busy. Malls reopening its one thing kids actually want to do at the mall. Other than go into the gamestop lol at least thatd how i still am
03/25/2021,stocks,Then you got the dirty mums who think everything is liberal
03/25/2021,stocks,I upvoted you because I agree
03/25/2021,stocks,90 million4th q revenue at 122 million valuation tho
03/25/2021,stocks,Right? Some companies trade 5-10x their revenue this is trading at 50 percent of that. Im new to investing but this looks like a steal
03/25/2021,stocks,I think 15 for me maybe 20 if I hold till 2021 q4 eqrnings like march next year maybe leaps at 15 strike price or 12.5 strike for some extra exposure I domt have a position as i just opened up an ira and am closing out other positions to fund this venture as soon as possible lol
03/25/2021,stocks,yup malls reopening soon i believe this one is undervalued and that low float could be the icing on the cake
03/25/2021,stocks,"I am 35, and hate millennials"
03/25/2021,stocks,I wonder if it’s just because it’s so niche?  Or maybe they missed expected earnings in the past. That kind of thing can effect a companies stock price for years.  Once burned......
03/25/2021,stocks,$15? It wasn't that high 5 years ago. What makes you think all these investors are going to show up?
03/25/2021,stocks,Those were christmas numbers too might look into some january calls or wait till they write march 2022 ones for the next q4 earnings
03/25/2021,stocks,Think it touched 14.94 ish if im reading the 5 year chart right. I think online could be huge. I have no idea if they have plans to do this. I also know theres a lot of hype driving the stock market right now and a dramatic uptick in volume plus low float and low outstanding shares could drive the price up pretty quickly. Only 11 million float with 15 million outstanding. A few days with 10 million plus volume you would definetley see a new floor as 15 a share only puts this company at a 300 million or so market cap with again 250 million in revenue
03/25/2021,stocks,"It sure could. But I'm out. Nothing lends me to believe investors will get the price to go up to $15. Going online takes away from the actual experience of Build a Bear, which is why kids want to go. It's for the experience as much as it that plush doll.

Good luck!"
03/25/2021,stocks,Agreed maybe paying a hundred dollars for a stuffed animal online isnt the ideal way to go lol its like a claw machine who cares about the stuffed animal its the 50 dollars worth of quarters you use trying to win that counts lmao

03/25/2021,stocks,Nasdaq.com dividend history will show u the most accurate info
03/25/2021,stocks,"How about just caculating it yourself?

It's literally just:

dividend divided by (current) price

Also one seems to be the quarterly yield and the other the yearly yield."
03/25/2021,stocks,"That’s because they haven’t had a consistent dividend. It’s been all over the place. So one place might calculate yield based on the last 6 months and another might look at the last 3 years.
If they stick to their most recent dividend forever, the yield would be around 9%... but that seems very unlikely. It’s more likely it drops back down to around $1 a year, which is around 3% yield. 

As another user said, your best bet is looking at the raw dividend yourself on Nasdaq or elsewhere."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Everywhere i look for ample says the div yield is between 9.44 and 9.8
I don't see 2.6% anywhere. $2.60 but not percent.

The div yield will be listed on your brokerage page."
03/25/2021,stocks,"you can always calculate the dividend yield yourself. companies don't pay dividends as a percentage, they pay out a flat amount.

just looked at AMLP, and their dividend structure is well... [a giant mess](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/amlp/dividend-history) so i'll use [T as an example](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/t/dividend-history).

they pay $2.08 per year as a dividend. it doesn't matter if the share price is $25 (8.3% yield) or $35 (5.9% yield), that's what the stock is going to pay out. you want to just look into how a given company/etf calculates their dividends"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Dividend pays .25 a quarter the stock price is 13.00

.25 x 4 = 1.00 
1.00÷13= .076 
Dividend rate is 7.6% 

You can also do this with your average price so you know what your actual dividend rate is

Same thing on that 13 stock but you paid 9 dollars for it months ago.

1.00÷9.00= .1111 your actual dividend yield is 11.11%"
03/25/2021,stocks,"It is hard to find accurate information right now for the dividend yield because in 2020 the entire market tanked by more than 30% and also completely rebounded in the same year (note, i said market not economy), and on top of that there were a ton of companies who suspended and/or cut the dividends... You are going to have to look for yourself and make sure the numbers are accurate and up to date"
03/25/2021,stocks,If it’s 9.78% then it’s the highest I’ve heard of and I want in.

2. no they won't."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Doesn't really matter if its part of the index or not, you're just using some index as a benchmark. Could be S&P 500, the dow, some total market index. Just pick one (or multiple) and be consistent."
03/25/2021,stocks,"A company doesn’t need to be part of an index to calculate alpha. I assume you’re using CAPM, you have a few routes. You can use the broader market (S&P500) or you can use a sector index as your metric."

03/25/2021,stocks,Ok cheers. I used NASDAQ Composite price as my benchmark for Activision Blizzard. Is that suitable?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Sure, but makes more sense if you are analyzing Japanese companies exclusively. If you want to compare how Nintendo's returns compare to some US company for example, you'll want to use a common baseline. I think a common US index like the S&P500 would be fine. Because the baseline doesn't really matter as long as its consistently used for every stock, it will just change the absolute values of the relative performances. But you could also use something like the MSCI world index or something."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah just make sure you use the correlation to the NASDAQ as your calculation for Beta. You don’t want to compare apples to oranges.
03/25/2021,stocks,"So even a company like Nintendo that is registered in Japan can be compared with a US company?

For me I am doing an event study so I need to find the abnormal returns after calculating the returns from Nintendo and Tokyo exchange. Does this sound about right?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Can you elaborate on that? To clarify, I got Activision price over a few days and also got NASDAQ’s price over the same few days, and I compared the returns. Is that correct?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Well if you’re taking the beta of Activision from yahoo finance, that beta is against the S&P500. So if you are comparing the risk adjusted return of Activision against the NASDAQ, you can’t use the beta with respects to the S&P500, you need the beta with respects to the NASDAQ."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes you can do that. I guess my question is, how sophisticated do you want to get? Seeing that your working on your finance degree I assumed you were learning CAPM, if not that’s cool. 

The thing with finance is that there is no “set” way of achieving an outcome. There are models and ratios that are strictly defined. But to the layman, if Stock A had better gains than Stock B over a period of time, it’s not wrong to say “stock a performed better than stock b”"

03/25/2021,stocks,"I suppose a smaller freight company that has it's only few ships meant to go through there now might suffer hard, because of running costs while not moving to earn money and maybe because of late delivery, then late pick-up of the next freight, etc. Depends on their contracts etc. though, and on how much of a blow it is to them - seems like a bet that requires quite a lot of detailed sector knowledge.

Same for supply chain - loads of customers have things in there, and it'll hurt just-in-time supplies the most (maybe the ones with perishable goods as well, depending on insurance?). There is a long route available, but that doesn't help much if you need something next week instead of next month.  Again, seems like you'd need to know the typical supply route and tolerance to delays though, so a bit complicated for a play like this.

 I've seen estimates that an extra day of shipping delay in a container ship costs 0.6-2.3% of the value of the goods on a ship. But the trick is which goods are creating that loss over delays of what length (can they stomach a few days delay with 0 loss? probably yes for carpets or paper... Maybe not high-end electronics though), and which ones are meant to be going through there but can't.

03/25/2021,stocks,"You purchased a long call with a strike price of $67 for a debit of $188 = 1.88x100 and an expiration of April 1st. The maximum risk here is the debit you provided, $188, and the maximum return is theoretically infinite. The ~$600 max profit was being calculated for a given range, likely at expiration. The breakeven for your option at expiration is 67+1.88 = $68.88. Therefore, at expiration on April 1st if DKNG is at exactly $68.88 then you will make $0 (minus any transaction fees you incurred). If it closes under $67 then you will lose the entire premium you debited ($188) and if it closes above the breakeven then you would profit whatever the difference is between that closing price and your breakeven. (e.g. It closes at $71 on April 1st and you make 71-68.88 = 2.12x100 = $212). 

If you do nothing at all, your broker, or the Option Clearing Corporation (OCC) on your behalf, will automatically exercise an option that is ITM by at least $0.01 (e.g. DKNG at $67.01 or greater) and you will receive a credit in your account for the profit. All of this only considers the intrinsic value of the option at expiration.

You can also sell the option prior to expiration and it may have some additional value (extrinsic value) in addition to any intrinsic value it has. For example, if DKNG hits $70 tomorrow, and assuming constant implied volatility, then the value of your option might rise to $370, which is greater than just the 70-68.88=$112 you would earn if this took place on April 1st at expiration. However, this extrinsic value decays over time as you approach your expiration date due to theta decay until only intrinsic value is left at expiration.

For what it's worth, it wasn't a terrible long call to buy and I think you stand a good chance of making some kind of profit here, although who knows especially in this market lately. I suggest setting a profit goal, at which point you should sell-to-close your option. E.g. If it hits 50% profit at any point between now and April 1st you sell the option and lock in your gain. Also, I would suggest reading some more stuff online before spending more money on options. This type of out-of-the-money (OTM) call purchase with a weekly expiration is highly unlikely to succeed if repeated over time."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ironically, it’s just gambling. So in my opinion it’s as simple as betting what you’re willing to lose as far as risk management goes."
03/25/2021,stocks,Join r/options for more detailed options info
03/25/2021,stocks,"1 call contract = you have the *right, but not the obligation* to buy 100 shares of a stock at the designated strike price x 100 until the designated date.

So, since you own an April 1st call at a strike price of $67, you have until April 1st the *right, but not the obligation* to buy 100 shares of DKNG for $67 each, so a total of $6700. This is regardless of the market price for DKNG. So, DKNG can hit $100 per share, and you'd still have the right to buy it for $67 per share.

This is how, in theory, you make money as a call buyer - the stock rises above your ""break even"" on the market, at which time you can buy the stock for the lower strike price you set, and then sell it on the market for profit.

Now, most options buyers won't be actually exercising their option. Instead, they'll be selling the option contract itself for a profit, once the underlying stock rises above the break even. This works just like a stock - your contract will rise in value as DKNG rises in price, and at some stage, you'll be able to sell it for more than you bought it for, at which stage you can decide to Sell to Close the contract and realize your gain.

But be careful - you only have until April 1st to sell or exercise the contract, after which it expires useless. Each day that passes where DKNG doesn't rise above $67, your option's value decreases. So most people will sell at a loss if they don't see any chance for DKNG to rise above $67 by April 1st. 

That then is the bet you're taking on - if DKNG rises about 2 dollars above $67, or around $69, by April 1st, you WIN and can sell the contract for a profit. If it doesn't, you LOSE and either the contract becomes useless on April 1st or you sell it at a loss before then."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Naked calls should have infinite profit potential and max risk of premium paid. Your breakeven price is $68.88 by the close on April 1st.

Did you mean profit target of $600? I'm not sure what level of option experience you have, but the underlying price will vary with DTE in regards to your $600 profit target. On 4/1 you would need the stock to be around $74.88. 

If the stock shoots up by $3 tomorrow you might be able to attain a $600 profit sooner. You would need an options calculator and input the other variables, interest & volatility, to get a better idea of what your options are worth."
03/25/2021,stocks,Thank you for the detailed explanation.  No I wouldn’t have made this trade if I knew what I was doing but it’s hard for me to understand unless I have skin in the game.  I’m glad you said it wasn’t a total dipshit play but not terrible either.  How far out would suggest I make for future long calls?
03/25/2021,stocks,I realize it’s all a gamble and I would never bet more than I’m willing to lose.  People are always commenting about how you can lose your ass buying options.  So basically I sell before the expiration date of next week whether it’s up or down?
03/25/2021,stocks,Yes the Td risk profile gave me a max loss and max earned but when I made the trade it had a max profit of infinite.  My knowledge of options are limited and experience is none.  So my question is what are my options by the end of next week?  Do I sell the option at current market price and will I be off the hook?  I see you can exercise the option for $6700 which I’m not willing to risk?  Also I can see that I can create a rolling order for $87 but don’t really understand what that means.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I don’t know all that much about options other than that it’s very easy to lose everything you put in them. 

Honestly don’t know enough about the expiration date and what happens when it hits it to help. But good luck, hopefully someone more knowledgeable comments."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ok. You are trading options, so haha, you have a few options. You never have to exercise. Any time before 4/1 at 3p you can trade the premium. The more heavily traded the tighter the B/A spread will be. At any given time, you can get a very good idea of the value of your option. DKNG usually has a tight spread, maybe only $.15 wide so you can hit bids to get out and you're not giving up much. 

So take exercising off the table. That leaves sell out at any given time before 4/1 or roll your option at either a debit (you pay) or credit (you get paid) to an expiration date beyond 4/1. 

I'll give you one example, and you can take the parameters and hopefully make some choices afterwards. 

Since you are an option noob, I would suggest ignore rolling, and that leaves you just one option, close your position at a given time (or let it expire worthless and lose your $188, but we're not Debbie-downers here and we'll assume you rock this and make some fn money). 

DKNG closed today (3/25) down $1.13 @ $65.50. Your 4/1 67c closed down $.50 around 2.05 and the closing delta is .43, meaning for every $1 DKNG goes up, your option will go up $.43 give or take some variables. 

Tomorrow being Friday, some weird shit can happen, so let's say DKNG is up $2.50 at $68, and your option is up about $1 trading around $3. If you decided to put a limit day order in to sell at $4 you would probably need DKNG to trade a shade under $70 to get filled.

I would recommend putting a limit order day order (NOT GTC) in to sell your option at $4. Maybe you get filled, probably not, but you will see how the market reacts, where your order sits in relation to the market, and hopefully, by next Thursday you can figure out what price you want to exit.

Make sense?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"at the minimum, go watch inthemoney's options playlist on YT. It is long but you will at least get familiar with the terms. R/options has a wiki you can go through. I personally would not trade options till you undestand what the terms mean and what the greeks do. If you want to experiment, you can paper trade options on thinkorswim."
03/25/2021,stocks,Thank you for the explanation.  If i was experienced with a full understanding of options I probably wouldn’t have made this trade.  I’m going to use your advice about putting in a limit order
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hope it works out for you. Remember, you are putting day orders, so they will cancel at the end of each trading day. So if your $4 offer does not get filled, it will cancel. 

Monday, the underlying will have settled above or below today's settlement, and the option market makers will have calculated what their fair value is for your call. You will need to put a new order in each day until 4/1. Hopefully after just a few days of watching how the stock moves, and how your call changes in price, you'll see how all the variables interact with the value of your call and you make some money.

Last bit of advice, you invested $188. Do not plan on becoming a millionaire. If you sell your call for $400 you doubled your money in, at most, 6 days. That is an amazing ROI. 

Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered. 

Good luck.💰"

03/25/2021,stocks,"The trust is already in the hands of professionals. Morgan Stanley. I've looked at the investment summary, and while I admit I don't understand a lot of it, when I look at the stocks they invested the money in, there's a lot companies I've never heard.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Confirmed, dumped 120k in January. Not having a fun time."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You think TSLA will triple in price every 3 year? That means the price will be x59,000 higher than it is now... so 37million per share.

OP - Think before you believe this kind of stuff."
03/25/2021,stocks,Looking for my money to grow consistently and steadily. I haven't seen a lot of growth with what the trust is currently invested in so I'm just looking to take a portion(about 150k) of the trust and try putting that in some better stocks.

03/25/2021,stocks,"That's called a range from a base case to a bullish one. 8x over a 10 year period is definitely very bullish, but I don't think it's impossible. That's 800% growth in 10 years, not 800% every single year for 10 years"
03/25/2021,stocks,That would definitely work. Wait for a dip and jump in.

03/25/2021,stocks,"What this guy said.

I don't know why you'd have multiple S&P 500 funds. Seems like the definition of redundant."
03/25/2021,stocks,Definitely not worth it if its short term gains. Otherwise its just a matter of if you want to pay taxes now or later. You'd also have to hold for another year before you can sell for long term gains. They are the same thing and the only difference is expense ratios and having your finances more organized if you combine them. (assuming US)
03/25/2021,stocks,Their positions are covered by equity. If their short positions grow relative to their long positions shrinking at some point their margin can be called and they have to liquidate enough to straighten out the numbers.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Until their equity is overshadowed by their debt. That's what normally triggers a margin call. The new DTCC rules should help, if they enforce it. However, I think that's unlikely. IMO, the more plausible scenario is they cover a little at a time and drive it back down, repeatedly, to get the best price. 

The million dollar question is how many synthetic shares and FTDs are in play? In the case of GME and AMC, Melvin Capital underestimated retail traders, and doubled down on the naked shorting. If either, or both, squeeze, they're destroyed. So who is left with the remaining balance, after they fold? Citadel, and any other MMs that participated and backed Melvin. 

I think most people are looking at this whole thing the wrong way. It's not retail traders vs. hedge funds. There is no loyalty amongst thieves. What we're seeing is war among the upper ranks of institutional investors. They're betting huge against each other. Look at the institutional holdings of each stock and how they've changed over the last couple quarters, especially Fidelity, BlackRock, and Vanguard. All three participated heavily in the initial momentum of WSB, and currently hold huge positions in both. 

Robinhood, Webull, and TDA all stopped buy orders (to varying degrees), but not sell orders. Fidelity did not. Why? First, Fidelity is so enormous that it's its own MM. This is a large reason they didn't halt, because they didn't want to wreck the market they've created. Second, Fidelity was holding a large stake for themselves, not to mention other institutional/accredited investors. Third, the other three ""brokerages"" never really possess your shares. They make money by scalping the orders, acting as dropshippers for investments. They're middle-man organizations that do the paperwork for larger and/or parent MMs/broker-dealers, skimming small profits off each order. This is why you usually make a little less or lose a little more trading with these ""brokerages."" Additionally, they sell your data to institutional investors that are willing to pay for an advantage. Free trades aren't free.

I don't comment much in this sub, but I watch a lot. There have been a ton of posts lately where people are losing faith in the market and beginning to panic. This war of elite investment houses is what's causing the red fallout in the broader market. A lot of people like to laugh off WSB (the same people scoffed at Amazon, Tesla and Bitcoin, also), I did too, but this is moving the entire market, not just meme stocks. Thankfully, I had the foresight about a month ago, to sell all my holdings and go all in on AMC. I saw it as a defensive hedge, and I should have done it sooner. Sometimes it costs less to go with the flow, rather than erode your principal trying to fight the tide. 

If the squeeze potential is real, these HFs will have to sell their profitable positions and find new short-term shorts. They've been doing that for a month and a half. This is what caused the market volatility, not WSB kids buying and holding. If it squeezes, to the anticipated levels, me and my entire family can retire. If not, there's no reason AMC can't return to the $20-$30 range. I'll take that double or triple over some of the ridiculous losses people have been taking in other stocks, lately."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Borrowing assets to sell makes the world go round.

If you borrow money for the purposes of spending it, you have shorted that asset in some sense.  You have short sold cash (in a very small, almost totally insignificant way).  You carry that balance as long as you want to keep paying interest on it or until your lender calls it back in.

You buy a house?  Well, you're short cash and long real estate."
03/25/2021,stocks,Same way you're allowed to carry credit card balance.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You can be short forever. Unlike a loan there are no repayment terms unless you run out of margin. 

The reason it's like this is because the loaner has 100% rights on the stock. They can ""demand"" repayment at any time, they receive all dividends and interest on the loaned stock, and can sell those shares at any time. Virtually all of of the risk is carried by the person borrowing the stock."
03/25/2021,stocks,">If not, they pay interest, but just like with a credit card, they'll garnish wages if you don't pay up at somepoint.

Not quite. Wages cannot be garnished for not repaying a margin loan."
03/25/2021,stocks,Because the whole system is rigged AF.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Understatement of the year, already."
03/25/2021,stocks,Cheaper to pay interest than to cover. Too bad we can’t pay interest to extend the life of call options.
03/25/2021,stocks,"People are obsessed with this narrative now. Market manipulation has existed for as long as the market has - just forget about, focus on your strategy and make money. You are not competing directly with hedge funds in the market - there is room for everyone."
03/25/2021,stocks,One guess as to which stock this post refers. Why isn't it $1M a share yet?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Shorting stock is like being on the other side of a callable bond; the bond can be for 50 years and if not called you don't have to do anything so long as you pay the fee. HTB fees are high, so high in fact, that calling the shares back if you're not going to actually sell them seems foolish."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ah... so one of two things need to happen:

The value of their equity drops thus being forced to liquidate to cover their positions.

or...

The price of whatever their shorting gets so high that the equity on hand now starts to become a problem as far as covering their short positions.

Now...

Citadel has a boat load of AUM.  Meaning, if a GME squeeze were to happen, their 35 billion AUM needs to be threatened to some extent.

Is there a way to find out the total amount of shares shorted for GME including ETF's that have GME in it that are shorted?  Not to mention naked short positions?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ah, so would this be why GME has a negative beta?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Similar, except everybody knows you have to pay those off before you start investing."
03/25/2021,stocks,Then just buy shares? Its interest free and doesn’t expires
03/25/2021,stocks,You definitely are competing directly against the hedge funds.  That's why payment for order flow exists.

03/25/2021,stocks,">Is there a way to find out the total amount of shares shorted for GME including ETF's that have GME in it that are shorted? Not to mention naked short positions?



If you work for Citadel's leadership, IT or Finance, then probably yes (or DTCC probably works too). Otherwise, it's all fun with numbers to get an estimate"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Probably, but what we will never know is what their relationship is with their creditors. Their credit rating. And don’t forget also that before they call the margin they will consider their likelihood of getting paid. If they call an unmeetable margin they lose. And also the hedges can raise more capital. Call in favors or whatever. It’s a big ol boys (and girls) club because they all benefit from keeping each other afloat."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Banking on Citadel losing enough money to be margin called is ... irrational. The issue with the Wall Streets Bets campaign is that they're expecting hedge funds to crumble before their onslaught but in reality hedge funds will last a lot longer than their ape wallets. I mean, whatever margin interest rates hedge funds have, you can be sure they can free up capital else where to not get margin called for a LONG time, so they can certainly out last the Wall Streets Bets crowd. Even more so when you consider that the total number of shares of Game Stop's float multiplied by the short borrowing cost is a few hundred million dollars at most, so even if hedge funds are losing money from margin interest, it's at most a couple million dollars a year.

All the while, the main ""wealth transfer"" that is happening is from retail investors who got in late to those who got in early, and to hedge funds who decided to make a game of it. It's a pump and dump scheme disguised as a digital Occupy Wall Streets."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Those are the publicly visible options.  People have access to capital through other means (favors, preferential credit terms, etc.).  There's a lot of misleading information out there by stocktavists who are claiming that if you throw enough money at this eventually they will fold."
03/25/2021,stocks,">including ETF's

Those have no effect on the underlying stocks."
03/25/2021,stocks,"How dare you imply a ""loan"" at 18-24% interest should be the top priority! 😄"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Who tf are you, Dave Ramsey?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Can you explain that a bit more?  I don't understand how the current system is worse for retail investors than paying $5/trade like you did prior to 2 years ago. How does payment for order flow affect your ability to buy/sell stocks within your overall investing plan?
03/25/2021,stocks,Lol okay

03/25/2021,stocks,!RemindMe one month
03/25/2021,stocks,Unless GME calls back their 69 million shares for recount 🚀
03/25/2021,stocks,"What if they're banking on GME going up from the price it was initially shorted at, due to new leadership and new direction? As in the hedge funds can never get out at a profit, so ultimately at some point in time will have to buy out?

Genuinely curious of your thoughts and not being a dick, wouldn't they have to cover some time?"

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment\_for\_order\_flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_for_order_flow)

It's like being able to cut in line. It doesn't cost them anything actually, it IS a bribe because they make more money doing it.

They end up getting more power to take more money and to be able to manipulate the markets making the markets not fair. By getting more money they can bribe more people to get more money, bribes that ultimately make them more money so it doesn't actually cost them. They can then fund corrupt politicians and destroy good businesses and ultimately fuck over society."

I think short-term, tech is simply higher risk higher reward. So you may miss out on superior returns, but if you need the funds, I’d go with less volatility. 

Although given it’s 6 months away, rather than a shorter term need, I think there’s an argument to be made for tech."
03/25/2021,stocks,No
03/25/2021,stocks,"Tech in 10 years? Very bullish.
Tech in 6 months? Yeah, probably toast.
I'm in a similar position as you. Sold most positions at even less than 25% profit but profit nonetheless, because I might want to use the money this year. I spent about $250 on cheap puts for Sept/Oct from now, in case of a market crash (figured low risk, possibly high reward)."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, you are completely wrong :P 

I hope you didn't the same mistake that a lot of misinformed and lazy people have done and bought that security. RLLCF is worth literally 1pence a share. Not more, not less. 

You see, if people actually did their DD (not attacking you, just ranting at people laziness in general) they would read through Rolls Royce investor information ( as easy as a few clicks on their website) and they would know that RR paid dividends in 3 different ways. Ca$h, RR stock or RLLCF shares. The RLLCF were redeemable for exactly 1pence whenever the company announced that they would be accepting redemptions. 

Right now, RR is not paying dividends and logically are not accepting redemptions. The only way to make money with RLLCF shares is to sell them to some poor bastard who doesn't know better. 

I hope I haven't come across super rude :D the thing is that these shares spiked hard a few weeks ago because some smartasses thought that they had struck gold and a lot of uninformed people followed suit based on hype... and that herd mentality, especially misinformed and dumb just rubs me the wrong way. Now a lot of sheep are stuck with shares worth 1pence smh..."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Makes sense on why you'd hold them. But making them tradeable they have to have some value. Reading https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominalvalue.asp seems as if they could trade higher based on their dividend payout (75% of libor - which is currently excruciatingly low) making them worthless because they're not paying currently and it's non cumulative. 
Looks as if they just started trading on OTC in 2018 in the US (at least that's all the back data I can find for now) so need some more digging. 

Again, I do appreciate the help."
03/25/2021,stocks,Check and see if you have to pay an extra fee for RLLCF. A lot of brokers charge a fee for foreign stocks. The ADR circumvents that and you don’t have to pay any taxes aside from our own.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Okay. The 0.1p is the ""nominal value"" (par value) which is used for dividend (yes, c share holders get dividends) and it ""has little to no bearing on the stock's market price"" https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominalvalue.asp
Much reading to do for me. Again thanks. You at least pointed me in the right direction."

I'm still a bit confused. It actually says it's 0.1p and they issued 4.6p per regular share on the last payout (so 46 c shares, I assume). I think I'm getting that part...

but why would it trade if it were a set price? And if it's  0.1p that would be .0014 in USD but it was trading (before the hype blow up) at 4x that at  ~.0043."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Well, I guess that a lot of people like me who are invested in RR.L ( I am from EU btw ) it makes more sense to redeem when the pound is strong and hold it when is weak. 

This was a nice talk. I don't get to discuss this often :)"

03/25/2021,stocks,I disagree. I think you can be informative without being rude. I didn't take this as rude but I guess it's a matter of perspective.
03/25/2021,stocks,You are right. I tried my best... but I am only human xD
03/25/2021,stocks,"Maybe I remember it wrong, but I was fairly certain that it was 1pence. If you got from a good source that it's actually 0.1p I stand corrected :)

The reason why it trades higher is because people don't know this and don't bother to even ask. Rather they throw money to anything that looks cheap. 

Now, to go a little in depth. These shares may at sometimes be worth a little bit over/under their redemption value. That is because one can use them to hedge against currency fluctuations, one can store gains there for a long time without being taxed, son on and so forth... And take those profits at a more advantageous times. For instance, maybe you don't want to redeem that money this year because you haven't harvested enough losses and you will be crushed by taxes if you realise more gains. Maybe you wait a little bit longer for the new taxable year. Of course, this means that your money is stuck there, but in some cases the opportunity cost is worth it. Experienced people know how you use this and other techniques to their advantage, the average investor should only worry about redeeming these shares at the appropriate time and to not buy them for more than what they are worth. Because in times like now, these aren't redeemable. Those who had their money trapped here have to wait until the company decides that they are in a position to reinstate dividends and accept redemptions. Looking how things are going it will takes years for that to happen...or their only option is to sell them to someone else. These shares should be worth less than their redemption value for this reason alone, because they aren't even redeemable, the uncertainty of if and when dividend comes back and because of that do not offer the hedge that they used to offer. Moreover, people with money stuck there should be selling them at discount in order to get some of their money back... 

Somehow, the opposite happened. Its unreal... does not make sense... at all... either that or I am crazy and a lot dumber that what I think I am, because I cannot think of a reason for these shares to be worth more now that they are useless than before when you could redeem them. 

The way I see it, a lot of people made a really bad mistake and bought these without even knowing what they were buying. I bet they still have no idea what these shares are, otherwise they would all rush to sell them and crash the price...

These are my 2 cents... and I want to apologise to you for my first comment. I hope you find this information and my opinion helpful in some way :)

Edit: forgot a point"
03/25/2021,stocks,0.1p was directly from RR investor page.. fyi but easy to confuse. You can say .01 usd and 1¢ they mean the same so easy to mix up.
03/25/2021,stocks,Thank you. I read it a long time ago. I will remember the right value the next time

03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the advice, will look into it!"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Id just buy shares on something like carnival but that’s just me and my personal risk tolerance on a play like that. 

Looking at their cash on hand I think they’re definitely going to make it through the pandemic and I think they will recover but whether or not they recover quickly is completely dependent upon how the cruise industry does when everything re opens which is a lot more up in the air."
03/25/2021,stocks,They are staying afloat by issuing more stock. It might be too diluted to get back to pre-covid value.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not the craziest idea. Obviously don’t overdo it in terms of dollars, as all options are very risky, but especially cruise stock options. 

I do think it’s a lock that the cruise industry sees a strong rebound. People will always want happiness and vacations.

What is not a guarantee is what Carnival’s financial health will be by the time that rebound plays out. Even when everyone books, they can’t just take that money and pay off debt, they have to reserve it for refunds and to pay operating costs for future cruises. They missed basically an entire year of up front cash for advance bookings, which will take a while to catch up from.

As another user said they are already issuing stock. It may be a while before they climb out of this hole and they may have to issue way more stock to help stabilize themselves. 

Basically what I’m saying is make sure you do the research here. This is very risky."
03/25/2021,stocks,I work in an industry that builds their ships. Havent been working for three months since everything is pushed back. The factory looks like a scene from resident evil atm. I would stay the fuck away from any positive assumptions regarding the company.

03/25/2021,stocks,Did you say ‘earnings’..!?
03/25/2021,stocks,"For what it's worth: I know way too many family and friends who are dying to go cruising and keep pushing back their reservations. I'm not a fan of cruises, but the demand seems to be there so it wouldn't surprise me for CCL to hit crazy numbers in 2023."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Good point. It really depends how much people have kept saved up over this year, and in the coming year. I feel like those who can afford a cruise probably have the money to buy themselves a holiday after the pandemic is past."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Good point. I'll need to look more into that, see if I can create some sort of reasonable estimate"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ya, I'm not really sure whether I want to invest there yet. I'm debating with it, but I feel like I'll have plenty of opportunities to sell off the option in the future, but if they take a huge hit after earnings for no genuinely good reason other than their earnings being poor, I may buy them options and see where it brings me"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Appreciate the feedback. Definitely good to hear the opinions of someone with experience there. I'll take your advice and stay away. My sentiment towards them was bearish, but I thought I'd see the sentiment on them to see if there is a good bullish case"
03/25/2021,stocks,It's just a long term option that allows you to get the benefit of holding 100 shares while only risking the premium payed.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Sorry for your loss. The first thing to figure out is your tolerance for risk, or your risk capacity. Can you stomach the volatility that comes with equities? If you can, and to ease your anxiety over the market being bubbly, pick a plan to DCA over a set number of periods into a broad market index fund like VTI/VTSAX and if you’re into international diversification, VXUS/VTIAX. 

Most important thing is to have a written plan. The next is to remove emotion from the equation no matter how hard it may be. Betting on markets to go up in the long term is a much safer bet than betting on yolo stonks. Good luck."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Super sorry for your loss man. I'd say take it slowww until you learn enough to make purchases and trade comfortably. Learn the rules. Use a reliable broker (ie: not RH).Call your broker with ANY questions you may have (that's what they are there for!). Read, read, read. I skimmed Reddit like crazy. Google.

My first investments were into Apple and Tesla last July roughly. Go for companies you know of and appreciate their products, management, innovation, etc. I am so thrilled I got into investing and I probably spend too much time and effort into it, but hey - at least I have another hobby!

I'd say figure out what you're comfortable investing and start working towards that number SLOWLY, while continuously saving hard from your work money to compensate.

Best of luck and please reach out to myself, or anyone willing to talk if you need. You got this!!!!"
03/25/2021,stocks,Property is the best investment
03/25/2021,stocks,"Sorry for your loss. 

That's a lot of money to deal with and I'm sure you won't want to have to deal with any anxiety of the ups and downs stocks take. 

You could try pick some stocks, but I would say place it in something like QQQ. I wouldn't throw it all in at once though, I would say buy $1-3k at a time, and try aim to buy the red days to average down rather than average up. 

I don't really know which broker is best as I live abroad, but with the QQQ, you don't have to worry about your money, it will always go up if you leave it in for long enough."

03/25/2021,stocks,If you want to be safe and get a good return I’d recommend SPY or VTI
03/25/2021,stocks,"So sorry to hear about your loss. Very smart and caring of your mother to have a good insurance policy in place. Looking after you even after she’s gone. That’s a good mother.

You’re job now I think is to be a good son/daughter and do good by your mother. I think first you need to fulfill any high interest rate debt(s) your mother may have had. These can haunt you if not taken care of. 

Then from there I would really ask yourself what you’re investing for. Is it for a nice home? To do right with your mother’s policy? These are all rhetorical questions you’ll have to figure out yourself. Once you know that, develop a plan to meet whatever long-term financial goals you may have. 

I know $500 is very minimal compared to what you have available, but I wouldn’t put anything in GME, or any volatile stock, unless you’re willing to lose it. No one can predict these things. Don’t let Internet people fool you into losing a good nest egg your mother left you.

Regardless, I think you should be investing for the long-term here. We’re talking years and not a get rich quick scheme because that just won’t work. Over time though, you will amass a nice balance if you’re diversified, ride the waves of the market, and hold.

I think your best options are Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are individual shares you can buy that are already extremely diversified across a given sector of the market and managed by firms who charge very tiny fees for you to own them. There’s some that mimic the Dow, the S&P 500, Nasdaq, etc. The returns of safe ETFs that mimic the market are very low risk and offer a decent return (10%+ per year). These are your best bet in my opinion. Your portfolio should be made up of mostly (75%) safe, broader market based ETFs. I would invest 20% in riskier ETFs that have historically been positive, but on a bigger return basis, so maybe 25%+ a year. The remaining 5% or less I would treat yourself to whatever you see fit. 

Losing a loved one can be rough and you deserve a nice vacation, new TV, etc. to help you take care of yourself mentally and physically. Maybe use this time to figure out the best investment strategy for yourself and heal in a way.

I wish you all the best! I know you will do great by your mother and yourself. Best of luck!

I am not suggesting for all $20k, but have you considered a charitable donation? There are many charities/agencies that provide support and education for mental illness, depression, suicide awareness, etc. You might be able to find some closure by supporting one of those organizations. 

Just like savings and investing, this is another topic that is pretty personal. Just a suggestion. 

If you want to look into good charities, [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org) is a pretty useful website."

Anyway, if you don't already have a Roth IRA account, start up one now.  You can contribute up to a certain limit every year (right now it's $7,000 but it will keep going up with inflation).  You can use any kind of mutual fund for your IRA but you might want to consider an index fund with Vanguard.

The key is to catch them before the run up though, NEVER chase after something is already up 200%. Also, don't be greedy with gains. If something is up 20-50% in a day, seriously consider cashing out because it's better to lock in at least some profit than watch it all disintegrate in a few hours/days."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Really sorry about your Mom.  That's very rough to say the least.  I'm glad you are feeling better about anxiety.  You sound on the conservative side financially.  And you the last thing you want to do is cause more worry.  Here's some options from most conservative to more risky: savings account, CDs, government bonds, SP500 or other index funds, diversified dividend funds, technology /growth funds - all the way to individual stocks.  

Your only race is to keep ahead of inflation - which isn't really difficult.  So an option would be to split it three / four ways and go from safest to moderate/low risk.  Maybe keep a little for more aggressive stock trading.  

Also, as someone who has had anxiety and PTSD from trauma - take care of yourself.  Never make any big decisions when you go thru a low point - they are usually not good decisions.   Keep talking to people and exercise does wonders.  Take care !"

If you're young, I wouldn't worry too much. Markets are historically growing at exponential rates. As long as you can leave the money to grow for 5+ years you can set up or do manual contributions biweekly/monthly to one or more ETFs of your choice.

You don't even need to research/study much as long as you stay invested and invest regularly. Just choose some ETFs or Index funds that cover a few sectors you like and buy $500-$1000 every 2 weeks. That'll be $13,000-$26,000 invested in the first year and if you can supplement with your own salary you'll be fine."

Sounds like you have some good ideas. You don't have to invest it all right away. Feel it out. Buying real estate is one of the safest investments you will ever make. Personally I really like the stocks LB and SLGG. Holding LB for roughly 6 months or until their stock splits between their two companies. SLGG I'll hold until it's over 1 billion market cap maybe more, could take years. That's what I've done at least along with se other dumb stuff but just look into the companies before you buy. If you believe in the company set a price you will sell at and make sure you sell when you get there. Then find a new company and start over."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I would keep it pretty simple. Put 60k in an index fund tracking the S&P 500 via Fidelity(FSKAX for example) and don't touch it until you plan to retire. Preferably max out your IRA for this year, then the rest in an investment account. Maxing out your IRA is tax advantageous as your gains will not be taxed. Picking individual stocks cause more risk and is more volatile, which I believe could be a source of further anxiety for you. Putting the money in an index fund will secure on average a compounding 8% return per year, assuming you re-invest the dividends. I'd stay away from bonds if you are a young adult. Then, the 20k you can use as your cushion and savings for a house. Some money for a couple of meetings with a therapist wouldn't hurt. After reading how you found out about your loss, I'd definitely recommend professional help even if you don't feel like you need it. 

Ps: what the hell is wrong with the guy claiming that you're bragging? He has lost touch of reality."

You can put it in BlockFi and get 8.6% Interest. If you depot 20k or more I think it is you get $250 worth of bitcoin as well. It is owned by Gemini exchange which is owned by the winklevoss twins that started Facebook with zuckerberg.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Sorry for your loss. I would put whatever percentage you are putting in securities into an etf like VTI (good buy right now at 202) It bounces around a little but not terrible. If you want to pick your own, just do a little until you feel comfortable with the companies you select. It’s a wild market and some are more predictable. I have noticed in these volatile times that the dividend stocks tend to stay solid because people start to park money there. The stock market is a bit emotionally taxing at times. Don’t worry yourself. Be conservative. GME is a rush but equally disappointing. Interest rates suck so that feels a bit chicken. I am definitely not a financial advisor. I have been where you are..good luck!!"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I appreciate this. That money already got me through a job loss (almost paid it back completely)

I bought a cheap mud toy to play with (cherokee 1750$)

I have a decent career, a degree and an ass load of federal student loans already so I'm leery of going back to school."
03/25/2021,stocks,This is great advice
03/25/2021,stocks,A house is a good investment as well.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Congrats, this is the best advice I’ve ever seen on this subreddit"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, mom did a good job preparing me."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I'm climbing the learning curve as we speak."
03/25/2021,stocks,I second this.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah it was just getting over that first hump. I'd research a little, and then the anxiety would set in because I was procrastinating. And then I'd just push it all away."
03/25/2021,stocks,This is cool advice. I actually bank with chase.
03/25/2021,stocks,Thanks for the in depth advice. I'm going to google some of your terms.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I'm giving it hell, just like she'd want."
03/25/2021,stocks,"This is good advice, but I'm not completely sure I want to wait till retirement to touch the money."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thank you, I appreciate that. I hope you're doing well too."
03/25/2021,stocks,That's what my gut was saying but I didn't have the investing vocabulary to form it into words.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thank you, I'll look it up and see what it costs."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah we were surprised too. But apparently after a certain amount of coverage time, some do pay out. I'm sure she had researched it."
03/25/2021,stocks,I had a relative call his ins company to make sure they would payout if he committed suicide beforehand. I wish they would have called 911. But they did payout to his wife & son afterwards.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I was once licensed for life insurance in all 50 states. Most states have laws in place where if a policy has been in place for at least a year, an insurance company cannot contest a payout for suicide (among some other things). It’s not necessarily to secure payout for suicide, but instead it’s to keep insurance companies from denying a payout to someone who forgot to disclose something that may have seemed unrelated at the time from losing out on an insurance payout should they die during the insurance period. (ie, could be hypertension, but could also be something like depression)."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I will, I appreciate your time and wisdom."
03/25/2021,stocks,There's a bit of a housing bubble at the moment in my area (Florida)
03/25/2021,stocks,"It’s basically impossible to buy a house unless you are paying all cash in many places of the country right now. There’s 0 supply. Might be smart long-term to buy, but good luck finding a seller."
03/25/2021,stocks,What crap
03/25/2021,stocks,"Solid advice, and TY for understanding both the gift and the burden."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thank you, I'll try to be smart."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I had thought about it, but I'm hesitant on spending the money on a advisor."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'll check it out
03/25/2021,stocks,VTI or VOO?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Damn. This is a great write up. Thank you. I'm very interested in EFTs. I'm going to learn more about them. 

I definitely treated myself. When I was laid off work for Covid, I didn't have to worry about money. That was a huge gift. I paid it all back though. I can't stomach using that money irresponsibly."
03/25/2021,stocks,Whats a good app for this?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah I was thinking the same. If you're right, I'm probably going to be happy I went with the 40% bonds with the first 10k."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm ideologically against apple. But I'll check them out.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I agree. I haven't figured out how to get into index funds on fidelity yet.

And don't worry about the gamestop thing I'm not a crazy. I make an OK living and I only have like 430$ in it. I basically just wanted to be able to say I was part of the party."
03/25/2021,stocks,Get out of here you ape. Lol
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I appreciate your words and thoughts. 

I'm not much for donations. All my mom really ever cared about was that I was happy, healthy, successful and prepared for life as possible. As long as that money is working for me and making my life better, I'm sure she would be happy, and in turn, I find solace in that."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I really really need to google EFT. you're like the fourth person to throw that term around.

I'm not investing any considerable amount into GME. Less than half a week's take home salary. I just wanted to play around and say I attended the party."
03/25/2021,stocks,Jesus Christ lol
03/25/2021,stocks,He got an insurance payout from his mother's suicide. Read the room mate...
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I appreciate it."
03/25/2021,stocks,My gut is telling me the market is going to start trending down. But I'm an eternal pessimist. Why do you think it's a good time to invest?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thank you. I'm doing better, and the better I do, the more I know she's happy with me."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ok, I'll go learn about that too."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thank you. This advice and two or three other directions, (index, paying student loans, ect) are my main take aways from this thread."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah I was looking into that last night but I didn't really comprehend much. I have a 401k account from a previous employer I could roll into it. its like 5k vested / 4k unvested. But it's doing pretty good right now and I don't think I should touch it.

Plus Idk about taxes and Idk what will happen to the unvested balance which, if I'm not mistaken, is still making me interest.

Edit- also, I only have a small amount in GME, like half a week's net wages. Nothing crazy."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, you're probably right. My situation is alot more complex than I've let on with my initial post."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I'm making my first steps towards making lemonade out of lemons. I feel alot better now that I'm actually making moves."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I'm working again, making good money, I'm in a location I want to be, and I'm taking medication that seems to really help with my anxiety. Thank you."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Probably Solid advice, but real estate is such a sellers market right now I'm my area it's actually insane."
03/25/2021,stocks,This sounds like the get rich quick schemes so many others are warning me about.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I appreciate it. it's been a tough road but I'm getting better."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I was a couple months ago, but quickly realized the housing market is about where it was in 2006. Sky high with very little on the market."
03/25/2021,stocks,This is a great piece of wisdom. Thanks.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah. That was just step one. My main savings has like .1% interest vs the .55 of my credit union. 

You're totally right though. I could have gained a huge amount if I had acted immediately. You may, or may not have experienced severe anxiety... but it can be debilitating/paralyzing. to the point that I was scared to even move that money to a higher interest savings account for over 8 months."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, her goal in life was to prepare me to be on my own. I've found notes and journal entries from the 90s expressing a desire to end her life, only resisting because of me.

One reads those things and reflects back on her coaching and words, and I realized she had been prepping me for her departure.

Your kids are lucky to have you, and benefit from your wisdom and I'm sure you're there to share their good times and bad. Thanks for being a good mom."

03/25/2021,stocks,Haha and now I get pulled to the dark side LOL
03/25/2021,stocks,IDK if it makes any difference to your advice but my base gross take home now is 75-80k and there's a possibility I could top out in 4 years at 100-110k.
03/25/2021,stocks,I didn't know I could talk to someone at fidelity for free. I'll look into that.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thank you, I appreciate your words and time."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'll look those up thanks
03/25/2021,stocks,My cursury research calls pltr a meme stock but NiO I think will come back. I have no idea what I'm talking about though.
03/25/2021,stocks,Thank you. Yeah I'm pretty self aware of my mentality. I try to take big steps back about decisions when I'm going through some shit. Doesn't always work but I'm ahead of the curve by just admitting it.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, this is something I'll have to research too. I'm going to sell GME at some point. Hopefully in the money. At that point I'll need to learn about short term gains."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah. This is what I'm leaning towards. I'm probably going to spread my money out over a wide variety of ETFs and index funds. 

I'm kicking myself now a little over the 10k 60/40 fidelity robo advisor I did. but at least the money is doing something."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the hug, I appreciate it."
03/25/2021,stocks,I every time someone used an acronym I have to look it up LOL
03/25/2021,stocks,20k as a down payment.
03/25/2021,stocks,It would be a 10% down payment.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I was worried about that too, but the cause of death was on the death certificate and the policy covered it. :Shrug:"
03/25/2021,stocks,"That's tough, I'm sorry she left you that early. And thanks I'll look those stocks up."
03/25/2021,stocks,"This is probably the easiest set and forget strategy. The more I learn, the more I think I really need to speak to a fiduciary though.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah man, I found my mom dead in the back yard with her brains scattered everywhere and I'm bragging about the financial gain from it on the web.

You're an asshat."

03/25/2021,stocks,Not sure what that is
03/25/2021,stocks,Well that’s great. Prob just increase the amount you pay each month at those loans or consolidate /lower the rate. Cuz if they’re like mind they’re like 5% interest
03/25/2021,stocks,If that’s the case I’d say pay off your debt my man. No feeling better then that of being debt free
03/25/2021,stocks,"Considering you picked up an XJ for $1750, I'd say you can count that as a investment with how prices are going"
03/25/2021,stocks, go by that 1750 jeep and spin the mud flaps off
03/25/2021,stocks,Only make minimum payments on student loans . Zero interest right now and may be forgiven.
03/25/2021,stocks,All in good time. Even if you learn something simple and seemingly basic that you didn’t understand previously...that is a really good thing
03/25/2021,stocks,"No problem. VTI and VXUS are the ETF versions of the total stock market and total international stock market (excluding US) mutual funds from Vanguard. Best places to decide an allocation between the two markets (US, global excluding US) and park them in the very low expense Vanguard funds. You can set and forget, don’t have to worry about constantly monitoring positions."
03/25/2021,stocks,Totally understandable but then it depends on when you will need it. I don’t believe in investing anything that you will need in 3-5 years. But that’s me. I am sure many will disagree.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Interesting. Again, sorry for your loss."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Buy FXAIX. Fidelity S&P 500 index fund. 

If you’re afraid of losing the gift but want to grow it that’s your play. Id invest little by little over time to avg costs in this market. 

At the end of the day even if the S&P 500 crashes it will absolutely come back sooner or later. If it doesn’t that 80k is the least of your worries."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I use fidelity. Index funds are just like any individual stock when it comes to purchasing them — just type it into the search bar, hit your order type, how many, confirm it’s what you want and the cost matches up, hit enter. Easy as pie. 

If you want very safe long term returns, stuff that tracks the entire market and international markets is what you’re looking for: VOO, SPY, VTI, VT. You could also do some aggressive midterm returns with ARKs. 

Sorry about your loss though, and I hope you’re doing alright."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Etf's are basicslly a basket filled with stocks of different companies. The baskets can be small / big / yellow / red. You name it, and it probably is there.

Like you have gaming etfs (filled with game related companies) / bio etfs / green sector etfs. Etc. It diversifies risk cause its not a single company in there. If 1 fails the others will prevent a big fall."
03/25/2021,stocks,"So basically what an ETF is by definition Exchange Traded Fund. So an expert picks a group of stocks and invests in them and you can buy shares in the stock. They can be more stable because the risk is spread over many different stocks. Look up Cathie Wood ARK funds, she has several different offerings based on different segments of the economy. Historically she has made great investments, her portfolio is down this year but I'm a believer. There are many different ETFs with different risk levels. You're on the right track, thinking about investing at your age."
03/25/2021,stocks,"One book I would recommend reading is ""the little book of common sense investing"" by John C Bogle.

Read the thread and use common sense before cussing me out. Try not to add stress by causing an argument. You wanna talk you can also DM me.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Honestly, I'm not the one to ask lol 

My history has been trash and I base my buys on feelings and minimal Due Diligence as the WSB say. There has been moments where I'd almost add 50%-100% value but some world even just kills it.

I've just noticed if everything is red then eventually most will go green. I've been through 2 ""what the hell why is everything crashing"" and have been able to pull back up.  First was Covid crash and second was this recent January.  Third has been GME just being a turd.

As tempting as it looks, I wouldn't put most of your eggs in any basket. I say that but I'm literally 100% in GME. I'm not part of the whole cult culture though."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah last year I had 60k saved up (for a down payment) and since it was such a crazy year I ended up making 80k off of the 40k I had invested. I definitely haven’t had anxiety and kind of need some will power if you wanna be a trader but you wanna be an investor. You need to separate your money from long term investments and savings that you might need to liquidate quick(if you wanna buy a house) for your long term investments that are kinda risky(okay if you’re younger than 50) would be TECL, TLRY, TESLA, MFST, ARKK, ARKG.

Just pay off the loans before you lose it in stocks my man.

If Biden actually does this (he wont BTW) it will be 10k MAX. (again its not happening) and if it does it will be for people making under 40k a year or something, with some crazy stings attached like you paying interest on it for over 10 years first.

You realize every democrat president has said this right? including Obama?

Be responsible and stop trying to wait around for handouts that are not coming, your mom would be proud."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Biden's president, not Sanders. I know he said he'd forgive 10k of student loans but it's not going to happen. Senate republicans will filibuster any such proposal, and Biden will focus on getting passed more urgent laws like voter reform / gun control / police reform etc.

Yes, there is technically a chance - but very unlikely. , If you're paying interest, at least pay off all but 10k to minimise the interest adding up, then, if there if forgiveness, you can get the final 10k forgiven free.

&#x200B;

Also, please don't invest in Gamestop. You say you're afraid of losing your mums gift and then gamble with it? GME is gambling and always has been. Best stay away from wall street bets too, its become a Gamestop cult that encourages people to gamble."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The loan forgiveness, if it actually happens, will not be complete forgiveness. Or even 50k. Biden said that’s just not feasible. If that’s what you’re worried about, pay it down to 10k then wait it out. 10k is the amount Biden said he could realistically make happen.

03/25/2021,stocks,"You're totally right. This is precisely why I made this post. To gain insight and to also check myself.

When the zero percent interest ends what I'm probably going to do is pay down 20k and then pay it down to 10k over the next year."
03/25/2021,stocks,Loans paid on an income based plan will be forgiven at 20 yrs after graduating or 25 if they are for grad school regardless of amount. That’s already how student loans work and requires no additional laws to pass.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Man, your user name takes me back. My mom gave me the first WOT book when I was 11 and it was an adventure that spanned decades of my life.

This is really good advice about the loans. After the 0% interest ends, I'll really start knuckling down on it.

But from what I understand, if my return on investments are more than my 5.5% interest on my loans, Id be doing good right? I do owe 38k.

As for GME I appreciate the warning. But don't worry. It's less than half a week's net wages and I'm not going to hold."

just FYI since last March the stock market it up a tremendous amount right now.

As you said you are not going to buy a house in a bubble, be cautious of the market as well for this same reason.

Especially if you are considering buying stocks often mentioned on Reddit."

Same (except...I kinda binge read 14 behemoth books in 4 months), absolutely love the books and looking forward to the [tv show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCQFyRGFfTU)

>if my return on investments are more than my 5.5% interest on my loans, Id be doing good right

Well...yes. But i prefer to think of it like this...if you could invest 38k of your savings in a 5.5% interest paying savings account, would you? Or, would you take out a loan at 5.5% right now to invest or put in a savings paying 0.55%? It's difficult to tell what the stock market will do in the short term, its always advisable to get rid of loans. 

> It's less than half a week's net wages

Thank god. I've seen the wsb crowd goad gullible new investors with the 'get rich quick' mantra. I'm glad its nothing too big, and that you know the risks. Nothing wrong with having some play money, you didn't mention how much you'd bought so I got really worried for a bit."

03/25/2021,stocks,"its not a bad play as long as you plan on having it in there a good while.

Being your age (i assume younger) you probably don't need bonds TBH. Its OK to put it an EFT or something instead if that's what you want.

I put in 40k of my own money back in March when everything crashed and was trading VERY low in comparison with the last 10 years.  I wouldn't have dumped that much money at these levels personally though.

But no one can predict the future, including me. so I cant say say for certain. just be aware of the recent large gains in a lot of stocks recently, and take what you will from that.

03/25/2021,stocks,"You’re posing the wrong question.   Need to ask: What happens if rates go up?

If the rates go up too much the housing market crashes due to the amount a person can get a loan for goes down.  Company start defaulting on debt more since it’s harder to rollover their current debt.  Then it spills into the stock market since share prices will drop and you will have margin calls go out. 

Now you have to ask what does it mean when something defaults on a debt.  Well that active money destruction since that money is taken out of the system.  This process is called debt deflation and it’s what happens when a debt bubble bursts.

The reason prices are going up on some goods is due to supply chains shocks caused by Covid and the weather.  Demand is still way down from where it should be."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The Fed wishes they could control rates, but they are not omnipotent.  An $80 trillion market is hard to control if people want to sell."
03/25/2021,stocks,"In a survey of all of the members of the Fed committee, 4 did say they believed rates would be raised sooner than Powell stated. Powell promised not to touch rates until 2023, however today he said the vaccination effort has sped up the economic recovery, leading to the possibility that the fed would ease their crisis combat policy earlier than expected. He maintains that long term inflation will not be an issue and that their target is 2% inflation. 

Personally, I think the fed has to make some changes to current policy as I do not think the current level of inflation is sustainable and will cause long term inflation to rise. I think we are printing way too much money and by end of 2021 we must begin raising rates. Intrest rates being raised as a preventive measure will do much less damage than interested rates being raised as a defensive measure if inflation is already to high."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think the market agrees with you. Overall it feels like Powell is trying to pacify us rather than give us the whole picture. I get it, he's trying to keep things as stable as possible but I think you're right. The writing is on the wall and rates will rise sooner than he says. It would definitely explain the continued shift away from tech and growth in spite of the 10 year yield rate falling slightly."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Problem now is that no matter what they do, we are fucked. Can’t kick the can forever,  but if rates are hiked this year, the market will crater. Could be the worst crash in 50 years considering existing volatility. It would end any chance Biden admin has of re election. So doubtful at least through 2022"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Also have to remeber that as much as we all rely on Powell and he may very well be the most powerful man in the world because his every breath affects the stock market, his ultimate job is to regulate the economy not the stock market. And, it may not seem like it, but the two are not the same.

The stock market is forward looking - what is going to happen? who is going to make money? what should we expect?

The economy is backward looking - how did X affect Y? Why is X happening in the world? What did the last X days/weeks/months look like?

Powell is in a reactionary position. He doesn't raise rates till inflation has already begun to rise, and by that point, the stock market has been expecting it and pricing it in for months - thus the saying ""buy on the rumor, sell on the news""

Unfortunatley, Powell is looking at economic data right now and saying while we may get there, we are not there yet so for the economy it is best to not touch things until we actually are at full opening/employment/rising inflation. This means the stock market is already beginning to price this in (that's why many reopening stocks are back at pre-covid levels, that's why inflation fears are right now harming the market).

03/25/2021,stocks,"Liquidity. I can’t remember which, but I’m pretty sure one of them has a larger float than the other, and I think it’s the non voting shares"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Voting power only matters if you can accumulate enough to actually make management changes. Most of the time it doesn’t matter so there’s only a small difference in price for different shares. Some classes also have different payout rights that can offset voting rights.

I’d imagine if someone was trying to gain a controlling stake you’d start to see a premium for higher voting rights, but it’s pretty irrelevant otherwise.

Edit: The case with the A share premium for Berkshire is totally different, FYI. They have greater claim to earnings and assets than the B, besides better voting rights. You’d have to look at the disclosures, but those shares are completely different as regards economic power. There is probably near zero voting premium on them. Why? Buffett has enough to control, so only his shares would have a voting control premium on them. If he were to arrange a sale of them all, all at once, you’d see that (they’d fetch a massive amount above where Berkshire is now).

You can see the same stuff when there is a takeover bid. The share price increasing is coming from someone paying up to get control all at once."

03/25/2021,stocks,"If there is a larger float it means there are more shares that can be traded, therefore the price will be more likely to move. Go with the larger float. The tighter bid ask spread on the larger float will help you fill orders at the price you desire. Vs playing the gaps"

good luck, the book is good"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Answered something like this before.  Here's that post.

___

In general I stick only with sectors and industries that I am familiar with.  That way, I know pretty quickly what to look for in terms what their product or service is, and if it's of any quality.

Then I'll look at their ""fundamentals.""  Their revenue, assets, profit, and debt.  I like to see a history of these numbers for the past 5 years, if the company has been around at least that long.  There are more fundamentals, but those are the four I look for.  As you read more and more of these about more and more companies, you'll learn more and more about which details there matter.

Try to find moves the company has made to get better position.  Sourcing deals, partnerships, spinoffs, mergers, anything.  Seeing jumps or drops in stock price history can hint about what time frame in which those events occurred.

Then I take a gander at the competition.

After that, I look at leadership.  You need to know about the people calling the shots, because they determine whether the company is successful, stagnant, or failing.  They determine the vision, direction, and path to their goals.  A company with a great product, lots of profit, tons of assets, and little debt doesn't mean shit to me if their *new* CEO is SuckBob FuckPants.  Bad leaders can tank good companies.

Conversely, good leadership can save failing companies. 

So find out who's calling the shots, who the CEO is, CTO or whatever, head of research, anyone.  Their career history, the track records of previous companies they've worked for (did they save something or tank it, or just meh?), where they went to school, etc.  It doesn't have to be FBI-class dossiers, but you should be able to name names and say ""They did such and such at X company before, and now they're at Y and building/doing an even better version!""

Fight your own confirmation bias.  Look for potential obstacles for that company, and give them real consideration.  This is why I stick to things that I know - I'll already be familiar with industry trends and common obstacles.  By doing this, I can skip writing many pages about obstacles.

The reason to do any DD is to inform yourself, but it helps me to pretend like I'm writing for a group of serious investors.  Once you've read, summarized, sorted and collated all of the relevant info and have a nice 5-pager, you can take a day off, then read the whole thing over again with a clear head.

And have fun.  I'm weird, but DD is hella fun for me.  I have no idea why."

03/25/2021,stocks,"You might want to look in ETF's.  Generally very very safe.  Maybe not 10% gains but generally close and sometimes more.

A lot of 1-year charts are biased because of COVID last year, but looking at VOO they are up 90% in the last 5 years. 

VTI is up 95% in the last 5 years. 

VBK is up 125% in the last 5 years.

And since it's an ETF the risk is spread out over many companies and sometimes over many different types of industries, so if a few companies do bad you can still have gains."
03/25/2021,stocks,"> But, let's say I have around USD$30,000 more to invest and that stock(s) needs to go up at least 10% a year from now

There is no investment anywhere that meets that criteria. If the value of your investment can't drop below $30k, don't put it in any stock.

You aren't going to see 10% returns without some risk, and the risk is that you lose money instead of gaining money.

Anyone who tells you they have a way to earn 10% in a year guaranteed is scamming you and you'll lose everything."

03/25/2021,stocks,There fees are locked into the etf’s so it doesn’t matter which broker you have; they’ll be the same. It’s probably best to diversify across managers and brokers anyway.

Theoretically, the guys that got locked out of GME on Robinhood could have effectively closed their trades by doing an offset on another brokerage."

They own vast swaths of land that can be pretty much instantly converted from tobacco fields into marijuana fields.

Walmart could grow year upon year, but a P/E that high doesn't need regular growth, they need break-out growth. Keep in mind retailer's margins aren't tech company margins, even most of Amazon's profit comes from AWS.   

Is Walmart a good buy? I have absolutely no idea, but you're definitely betting on something big at the current price and there absolutely could be a correction (in particular as they're priced like growth rather than value)."

03/25/2021,stocks,I’m in on wmt. Their online business will be big time.
03/25/2021,stocks,"mainly because of the dip we see right now with WMT.

Instead of comparing the 5 year data, compare the time when WMT had dips:

Nov 2015: Walmart dropped 30% from ATH. To date, WMT had 126% increase, VTI 94%.

May 2018: Walmart dropped 20% from ATH. To date, WMT had 59% increase, VTI 44%.

You can't time the market, but at least you can buy dips."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I agree on both of your bear cases. However, I don't think those two factors are big enough to actually lower the value of the stock when compared to the market."

03/25/2021,stocks,You are totally right.
03/25/2021,stocks,TGT is solid
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah but thats with the added risk of execution on walmarts part (versus full market performance), hoping the revenue doesnt dip more than expected (faster openings, people dining out). Suggestion being, that WMT all time high could be factors including lockdown boosting WMTs sales, which could take a downturn now. Performance in lockdown for WMT shouldve been higher with the advantage it had but it was less than half of it. If it cant win in conditions suited for it, what confidence can you have in revenues expected to decline? the market also isnt rational.. next time they see a big dip in revenues, WMT could dip again (even with expectation priced in). For individual stocks to grow more than the market, there have to be big catalysts, not just price action. 

Why wont you bet on amazon or apple versus walmart? theyre on the exact same dip with revenues not expected to slow down as much and have beat the market in any time frame?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I just think the valuation of amazon and apple are very high right now especially with the potential seasonal rotation. I think MSFT is a better buy than those two. 

I agree mostly with your first paragraph. I also own VOO to track the market as owning a single stock like you say carry a risk."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Apple PE is 32 versus WMT 28 - apple with growth revenues and WMT with declines. How do you think Apple is overpriced and WMT isnt? if WMT maintains the same PE, if its revenues/earnings dip, so will its share price. Only way the share price increases with dip in revenues and earnings is its PE increasing - what makes you think it will?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"With Apple, I am not comparing PE. I am factoring in seasonal rotation.
Also, we can't compare PE of a tech company vs a food retail. 

The reason why I think MSFT is a better buy than Apple is because of it's diversification of the business. I get that PE for Apple is slightly lower than MSFT, but again, factoring in the seasonal rotation, I think diversification in the business is good.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think anyone will go wrong with picking Apple or Amazon over WMT. In fact, in the long run, they may very well get better returns. At this point in time tho, I like the dip I see with WMT."
03/25/2021,stocks,"When you say seasonal rotation, do you mean 4-6 months at best? are we talking short term holds for all this or more than a year?"
03/25/2021,stocks,should have said sector rotation.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Here's the little I know about this. In IPO (initial public offering) the initial amount of stocks and initial price are decided. There is some negotiation. Big investors committed to participate the IPO have their say about the price. I don't think there is one optimal target price for single share. Those responsible just try to engineer the share price and amount offered so that the company gets the amount of capital it wants, the existing ownership is diluted acceptably but the IPO price will still remain attractive. Having said this, I don't think anybody wants to make the initial price $1 or less. No one willingly creates a penny stock - it is a result of stock price falling.

The stock price after IPO is a different thing. There are studies suggesting there is an optimal share price for market cap. I've heard examples between $5 - $8. Example: company trades at $20 when the stock is split in two. The new stock price settles somewhere higher than $10, causing the split to increase market cap. According to theory anyway. 

There are differences between countries. In US markets there are a lot of very high stock prices. In Finland stock markets companies usually start planning a stock split once the price is getting close to 100€."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, but I feel like some stocks do start trading at very low dollar amounts and have very high shares outstanding numbers, and all they would need to do is reduce the shares outstanding to IPO at a lower price. 

Not all stocks become penny stocks because they lost value. Some just start out that way."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Wait at least till March 30. Personally I think they will not only tell earnings but we will also learn about future possibilities. I hope, but do not expect the stock to skyrocket next week. Market is too red at the moment. Time to leave your screen at home and take a nice walk or ride a whale or something.

\*not recreational of financial advice. Just love BB and whales"
03/25/2021,stocks,"You can't say BB is a failing stock because it has always been a speculative play. It has always been a growth tech stock chance. The hype is speculation that it's software products have a home and a market in our inevitable EV and smart home futures. But, it is pure speculation. its major product and contracts won't be showing up in the balance sheet for a couple years.

If you understand what you are getting into, no, it is not a failing stock.

If you though this was a GME meme stock to the moon... well, sorry you got suckered. I guess in that lens it is failing.

As I noted below, i'm selling one week calls that net me $32 - $40 at 10.50 strikes. So far so good, keeping me treading water while we see what the future holds. If BB stays relatively sideways or even down but maintains it's bullish outlook (which most analysts are rating it) I look to be scraping in \~$120 a month with calls. If it shoots up, it might hurt but I will be slightly in the green none-the-less. However it the stock tanks too much further, I might have to set my strike under cost, or do longer calls. We will see.

Anyways, a whole lot of words for me to say I am not worrried, it is a long term speculative hold stock and I am making the most of my position by pulling in a little passive money on it."
03/25/2021,stocks,I am not invested in it; however my tech friends love their patent portfolio and is their value.
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s a growth tech stock that should be a long hold if you’re in it. Currently big money is pivoting out of that sector. Either ride the whales or have more conviction about what you buy.

Bear Case: Niche retailer who took a large impairment charge in 2020 which took them to a sizable loss. Will face ever increasing competition from online mega giants, and they have a material debt overhang.

Bull case: Even the absolute worst retailers are trading at a 30%+ revenue multiple premium from JOAN’s current levels. Even at my absolute most bearish valuations, where they’d still be the cheapest retailer I can find in the market, there’s 8-10% easy upside. When you consider they’ve generally turned a profit, had been consistently growing revenue YOY, and it’s being reported will be offering a $.40 dividend this looks like it may be another CARR situation where there’s 100% upside just to normalize valuation.

2021-03-25 19:53:18,stocks,"Where to put money - for a long term investor Sorry I don't have the answers to the question in the title...this is mostly thinking out loud & hoping to spur productive conversation.

Like many of you, I have been somewhat baffled to see my portfolio getting crushed, while the indices continue to trade near all time highs (obviously Nasdaq a bit lower than S&P500 and Dow).  Sure, my portfolio is tech-heavy, but I've got ~40% of my portfolio in non-tech.

So the question is: if these stocks are all getting smashed, where is all the money flowing to? I checked out the YTD returns of the S&P500 components, which can be found here: https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance

Just from skimming through that list, I noticed a few themes: oil stocks, bank stocks, a few industrial stocks sprinkled throughout, and some reopening stocks (i.e. retailers, airlines).

So that answered some questions for me.  My portfolio has no oil, bank, or industrial exposure.  I've previously been bearish on oil and banks and I don't feel like I innately know enough about industrials to invest intelligently in those stocks.  I'm thinking a lot of fellow amateur investors are at least somewhat in the same boat, so this market rotation seems to be driven by professional money managers into territory that the rest of us aren't super comfortable with. (Over simplification - I know. Just trying to piece together a story that makes sense at a high level).

So this obviously leads to the question - where do I put my money?  I'm lucky enough to have some excess cash, so I have the option to double down on my big tech names at these lower levels.  I've already averaged down multiple times, so the tech allocation in my portfolio continues to grow, so I hesitate to repeatedly throw money in as the techs keep getting pounded.

One of my fear with this is that 10 year bond rates are sitting around 1.6%.  I feel like we'll have a very slow, creeping climb to around 2.75% or so.  So are tech stocks going to continue to get beaten up every day we see a 0.1% increase in bond rates?  I don't think thats sustainable, so at some point when bond rates rise and growth stocks don't get pulled down, that could potentially be a sign of a bottom and that may be time to dump money into high quality growth stocks as they start to climb back up.

The other option is to join the crowd and invest in oil, banks, or industrials.  I feel like I've missed the run-up in oil stocks and that seems like it'll be a diminishing industry over the long haul (though not over short or mid term). So maybe throw some money at industrial or bank stocks to hopefully create some offset in tech-heavy portfolios?

What do you guys think?  If you're a long-term investor, where are you going to put your money at this point?"

But why do they keep faltering?  I've taken some big hits and I kept wondering why my investments kept dying...until I zoomed out. Apple has retraced every single ATH gap up that I can remember since 2007ish. Apple has had plenty of gap ups, but the concerning ones are gap ups that take the stock to an ATH. On July 31st 2020, apple gapped up to new ATHs.

Back in July of 2020, [Apple announced a 4:1 stock split.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lcarrel/2020/07/31/apple-announces-4-for-1-stock-split-to-bring-in-new-investors/?sh=62ba0f2b5401) This was around the same time that TSLA did the same thing. There was a ton of market euphoria and guess what happened when apple announced its split? 95 > 108. Nearly a 15% gain in a matter of days. And the stock kept going up from there.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/EjY0kYu1/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EjY0kYu1/)

If I had to throw some chips on Red it would a retrace to $100ish before earnings and then a steady climb to $150 following that.

03/25/2021,stocks,"you are investing in options, as Peter Lynch said, you can be right on the stock, but wrong on the timing. so your options may expire worthless.  If you went long the stock, and just held, i think you would have been fine. you are looking for quick gains, which does not always happen."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Buy apple when it’s up, buy apple when it’s down, buy apple when it’s moving sideways. You’ll always get a big return no matter when you buy it eventually"
03/25/2021,stocks,"What's with so many people putting ""this is not investment advice"" on posts??"
03/25/2021,stocks,Don’t forget Apple has doubled in price over the last 52 weeks. It’s 52 week low was $59
03/25/2021,stocks,"Apple has gone down with other tech, but I’m very optimistic that it will eventually rebound since their fundamentals are on point. 120$ is a good level to add or get in. It’s my biggest holding and I like it that way."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm never worried about apple. Never. I own a lot of Apple and it's one of my biggest stocks. They make so much bloody money and have tons of cash.

So their PE is high. Who cares. They make a ton. If you like the stock, nothing to worry about. Their dividends are garbage. But they are thee moat in the world right now"
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's because in the short term they are quite pricey, they doubled in 2020 while earnings did not amd are trading at double their historical p/e, so yea short term apple is priced high, long term I wouldn't worry but short term it can go down quite a bit"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I got aapl for 102

Never should have sold. But I did"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I don't like two things about [apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl8fFOrKolk): Apple has USD 300 billion in cash and I don't know what to do with it. Second, a share buyback program is also an oath of disclosure. i don't see any groundbreaking inventions and i consider the apple car to be a marketing gag that should become concrete in 4 years at the earliest. what do you all mean?"
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s dropping because it is overvalued and is reverting back to its long time valuation metrics.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Apple “seems” like a solid company. I stopped reading lol. 

It’s Apple dude..."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It went up 350% in two years. Did the business become 350% more valuable in two years? Probably not. Yeah apple is a solid business, one of the best in the world, but it’s overpriced, just like all the rest of the greatest businesses in the world. The price is probably just coming down to something more reasonable."

03/25/2021,stocks,"The difference between this statement and ""I do not consent..."" is that there are more eyes on these types of posts. It hurts nothing and it's added in context of my own personal research. There are a lot of people who jumped onto the investing bandwagon after GME and everyone is looking for advice. The statement might be weak, but sometimes it needs to be said - because there are some extremely young people out there who think that anything they read on the internet is professional advice.

That doubled in 52 weeks isn't a fair comparison since COVID-19 pandemic was a black-swan event. You'd want to look at pre-COVID. Which of course still says a similar story - the stock has grown significantly even since pre-COVID levels.

That’s irrelevant. His point is performance over the last year is 100%, having a period to cool off is totally normal/healthy"
03/25/2021,stocks," that is dead capital. if a company doesn't know what to do with its money then i see that as a real problem. apparently you have no ideas. a share buyback is really the last thing you do  then occurs. where are the innovations that go beyond? I think an apple car is nonsense. fully autonomous driving is still a long way off. you need help and a market that is already saturated. At least that is my opinion. you need something new, be it in the area of ​​health. Perhaps one should orientate oneself towards developing an early warning system for heart attack via the heart rate monitor, for example, subject areas in which a lot of money can be made. promote preventive health or the topic of ""augmented reality"". but not an apple  car"

03/25/2021,stocks,Where are the innovations? Mate have you been blind? Did you take a look at their ARM chips. Those chips are absolutely insane for what value they can bring to laptops/phones. I have always preferred other stock over Apple but that innovation alone made get a position. In regards to cash they are likely prepping their next big move and we are currently in a economic crisis so it is probably wise to keep a huge amount of reserves.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Apple is extremely innovative and constantly takes products and makes them sell like hot cakes to their cult-like fanbase. They will lead the at-home consumerism for electronic wearables and phones.  I wouldn't be surprised if more things started coming from them, such as augmented reality glasses in the future. (they have currently the largest AR platform.)  Did you think the overpriced ear phones were nonsense? Who would buy those things were my initial thought. Well....

2018 AirPods estimated sales: $3.3 BILLION

2019 AirPods estimated sales: $7.3 BILLION

What ground breaking technology have they ever created that wasn't originally designed already and they just made it ""better"" from their consumers point of view, which eventually ended up selling like hot cakes? 

SP500 / VTI / BERK all hold Apple as their #1 holding - should be enough to tell you they are a solid company"

I'm undecided on the car. It's either the worst idea for Apple to do or the best idea. I can't help but think that for quite a while now, everyone who thinks Apple has just released the dumbest thing in the world that nobody is going to buy (iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch...) ends up proven completely wrong by the consumer, so if Apple thinks they can make a car, maybe I should just shut up and let them make the car..."

They are not the #1 seller of smart phones anymore however, and they don't really report how many they have sold either. I believe they know they need to branch out of just smart phones.

Bear Case: Niche retailer who took a large impairment charge in 2020 which took them to a sizable loss. Will face ever increasing competition from online mega giants, and they have a material debt overhang.

Bull case: Even the absolute worst retailers are trading at a 30%+ revenue multiple premium from JOAN’s current levels. Even at my absolute most bearish valuations, where they’d still be the cheapest retailer I can find in the market, there’s 8-10% easy upside. When you consider they’ve generally turned a profit, had been consistently growing revenue YOY, and it’s being reported will be offering a $.40 dividend this looks like it may be another CARR situation where there’s 100% upside just to normalize valuation.

2021-03-25 19:14:46,stocks,Buying undervalued stocks in this dip Alright boys I’m taking the plunge and buying the dip. I got a wad of cash burning a hole in my pocket and I need some picks from you guys. What are some good quality stocks that are still undervalued?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Use this (it may turn out that ""the dip"" is not enough of a dip):  


So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."
03/25/2021,stocks,"before you buy on the dip, you should make sure that it was not over valued to begin with.  The advice to buy on the dip is a good idea, as long as the businesses you are buying are cheap"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Nike! Fell 7% after earnings and another 5% after Chinese media backlash. Earnings miss was due to supply chain issues and they expect to increase next quarter sales due to pent up demand.

The drop today was an over sell off and when it's happened recently it's recovered to 145 within a few days so I'm expecting to see it go up 10/15% within next week or two."
03/25/2021,stocks,For undervalued I definitely suggest you Hitif and Siemens AG (long hold with dividends)
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you want aggressive/volatile, Amyris is my #1 pick on manufacturing advantages and great consumer brand potential. If you want safer, I really like Disney on streaming growth and park reopening happening simultaneously. Microsoft  is always a safe bet for as long as their CEO is someone other than Ballmer. 

I like Pinterest long term but it’s right in the center of the stock market/reopening drama and I’m not sure this is a good time to buy."

03/25/2021,stocks,"You may want to sit on your hands some more. There's no indication this downturn is about to turn around anytime soon. Best bet right now is we trade sideways (in tech that is). Not advise, just offering another perspective."
03/25/2021,stocks,"We are at the bottom of a long growth cycle.  Buy Cyclicals, Industrials and Financials.  Some tech, but wait because the drop on tech is not over.

03/25/2021,stocks,"I would say split it in two buys, one this week and wait to see if there is anymore dipping on your stocks and buy more. If they start heading up, then make a choice and buy more or wait foe another buying opportunity. Do some tech analysis and use candlesticks at 4hr to look for double bottoms or tweezers which indicate a potential reversal formation. My two cents. I suck at stocks."

03/25/2021,stocks,"SPAC mania got an absolute ass pounding. 

Some of the better managed spacs are near NAV now. I had issue with these earlier as why would I pay 30% over NAV when there’s no fundamental development since the first day of the fund being created? But now seeing things like the theil Capital SPACs sitting at like 7% and 3% above NAV for BTWN and BTNB respectively. 

Opportunity cost is a factor to consider. Because for all you know that money sits there for a year and the price never changes. But if you’re worried about things going lower, something with a NAV close to its current value, seems like a safer bet, and with leadership worth a premium that currently isn’t baked in, i think it’s finally a good time to take a bite on a few of those SPACs."

03/25/2021,stocks,Than why are you asking for undervalued companies to buy?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Personally? I think the theil Capital ones are solid picks right now. BTNB safest play in terms of protecting capital, but you’ll be waiting longer for an acquisition. BTWN is slightly more, so a bit more risk, but shorter wait time for acquisition, so less opportunity cost. 

PSTH isnt bad either..it’s the most hyped, but it also has a $20 NAV and sits at $24.24. If this one finds an interesting target, it will gain the most traction from the market- but in the short term if yields pop more or markets generally keep heading lower, you’d lose more here compared to the BTWN and BTNB, since it has more speculation baked in, and we’ve seen speculation getting hit the hardest lately 

I also own a little VSPR. on the merits of Brent Saunders being a legend in the space, has backgrounds in leading, executing mergers, has history on the compliance side, overall a pretty impressive resume. They already have an acquisition, Hydrafacial, so don’t expect a hype run on speculation for this one. However, hydrafacial has some pretty impressive growth, good margins, a logical business model, and really promising consumer reviews. It’s a covid recovery play as I expect it will run following earnings reports showcasing demand after this is all over. I think this pandemic interrupted their popularity just as it was hitting critical mass. Hydrafacial was Brent’s first choice after selling allergen (the Botox company) as he believes this is the next big fad in professional skincare treatments. So that’s one I have a smaller stake in, that I plan to just set and forget for a while. 

I’m sure there’s other decent plays right now in the SPAC market, this is just what I’ve settled on in the research I was able to do, but take a look around, you might find even better options than these."

2021-03-25 19:09:49,stocks,"Opinions About Teladoc (TDOC) Almost at Pre-Pandemic Levels and Why It's Dipping So Hard? Wondering what's everyone's opinion about this stock and anyone knowing why it's been dipping so drastically lately? As well as the bullish and bearish case for it? They seem to have a lot going for them and I think they're the perfect cross between the health and tech industry. They're also bringing in a lot of revenue, but for whatever reason their expenses are absurdly high as well. The most enticing is probably its current price which is almost at pre-pandemic levels. On another note, also wondering given it's massive drop lately, if simply buying the ARK ETF with it inside is safer run in the short-term."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I know that Amazon's latest telehealth venture was a cause for a slight drop. But, I was expecting it to go up right away. As someone who works in healthcare, I was expecting this one to go up and up, and then stabilize once COVID starts to go down. In fact, I am holding it at a huge loss too."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’ve been riding tdoc for a few years now and have plans to be a long term holder. Cathie mentioned how tdoc and others disrupt their industries so eventually any company that see’s success will have competition. 

AMZN is a little scary but they have struggled and failed in past ventures outside of their core business. I would like to eventually see a distribution partnership. 

What I am trying to grasp however was the tdoc report last quarter."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Buy the dip imo.  But I think it’s also possible/likely that as the pandemic ends, larger investors are liquidating pandemic stocks.  Also, there are private competitors that could impact it, like Ro (the company that lets people get viagra subscriptions online easily, and other drugs).  You can easily get a doctor visit/prescription with that and their valuation is soaring."
03/25/2021,stocks,The etf will definitely be less volatile due to diversification. However short term I can't predict. I'm personally going to keep buying the dips because I know telehealth is going to take over the vast majority of paitent check ups and small appointments in the long term
03/25/2021,stocks,"One bearish argument for teledoc is that the pandemic forced many health care providers and institutions to start doing telehealth or threw gasoline on their existing efforts.  Now that the pandemic is winding down, these providers still plan to utilize telehealth going forward.  The pandemic created more competition."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I like TDOC for the future, and I have owned it previously. I rode it up last time from 180-290.

Saying that, just because the price is down doesn’t mean the stock isn’t still expensive. They are currently trading around 25x sales. Margins are good though as you point out, so are expenses. I am not sure what’s up with the expense surge in 2020 but I assume it’s related to the Livongo merger. 

Otherwise I think they’re down today in sympathy with Amwell, in addition to the overall market. On a more macro level, there is also uncertainty over the future of WFH stocks following reopenings. Plus there is the not insignificant threat from Amazon entering the space.

Overall I’m bullish on TDOC but still looking for a better entry."

Not trying to be bearish and hate on them - but I really don't want to go to the doctor via a computer screen.  I want healthcare to actually be affordable and actually go to the doctor and get examined.

I don't know.  This movement just seems super weird unless there are other benefits I am just not aware of that are needed in medicine?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Short term there isn't much catalysts for it. Competition and things going back to normal are serving as bears. I am still hesitant on buying this dip. May go down further. To me TDOC is a long term play.
03/25/2021,stocks,I have been treated much better via teledoc including follow up care than any urgent (not) care or in store clinic that I have gone to at a much lower cost.
03/25/2021,stocks,Like the stock but I know shares outstanding are not the same as prepandemic. It’s hard to calculate with Livongo being bought in shares and equating in their shares and market cap. Then I also don’t remember if they did any equity raises. So you really can’t just line up the price of the shares at the dates. Livongo is the reason it has some sort of moat. Using data and eventual AI will be crucial.

03/25/2021,stocks,"It's a crowded space, and investors might not be convinced that TeleDoc has sufficient market share to justify its (expensive) stock price.  For example, my wife is a physician, and she doesn't know anybody who uses TeleDoc...the doctors all use Zoom for their tele-health visits.  I think there may be a presumption by laymen outsiders, that the snappy name and ARK status somehow elevate TeleDoc to an elite position in the tele-medicine arena, but that belief may not align with reality on the ground."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I've personally did a few telehealth meetings this last year with my kids.  Super easy to get a quick opinion on small things that you can setup in minutes and get a prescription if needed.  For example, my kid got a weird rash and the doc was able to identify it and got us a prescription and he was good as new.   Super easy.  

I've done both teledoc and another one that I can't remember but they were both basically the same.  Just sharing my experience but telehealth is definitely the future.  It just depends on which one will win the stock battle."
03/25/2021,stocks,">	but I really don’t want to go to the doctor via a computer screen. I want healthcare to actually be affordable

The only way that’s happening is either bringing costs down via telemedicine services which have fewer overhead costs for routine visits that don’t require being present, or still trying to drill into people’s coconuts that proper healthcare should be a right and isn’t going to turn their gated neighborhood into a Venezuelan slum. 

>and actually go to the doctor and get examined.


Okay, there’s nothing stopping you from doing that."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm bullish and have used Teladoc in real life and it's always still great to hear the bearish argument from the opposing side. I see where you're coming from, I actually also prefer to see the doctor in real life too, but there are actually many benefits to going to the doctor by a computer screen, imo most that find it weird have simply never tried it. 

For instance, a lot of older people that stay home, sometimes don't have the physical health and ability to travel or walk over to the doctor, this was especially true during covid, when everyone was essentially pressured and pretty much forced to stay at home. Even once lifted, people will still go through other health complications that make it easier. It's also convenient as a timesaver for people on a busy schedule, especially if they were only hoping to visit the doctor for a brief check up anyway. For instance, I regularly have to visit my psychiatrist, but when my schedules packed, it's much easier for me to open up Teladoc and chat with him for a couple mins, then go back to working on stuff, than to have to take off, travel to the office, just for a brief 15-20 minute conversation."

2021-03-25 19:01:09,stocks,"Time to update my investing strategy Before I begin, let me just say that for the most part, I've had my head in the sand regarding recent market movements.  This is not a reaction to any correct that might be currently happening, but rather to a sudden (but very welcome) change in my personal financial status.

Up until recently, I've been unemployed, but with a couple thousand USD put aside in a roth IRA and invested in a moderately concentrated spread of tech stocks, growth-focused ETFs, and some REITs.  I don't regret my past decisions, but since I've recently secured a well-paying job and I'm living with very low expenses, I'd like to start putting aside a few hundred dollars a month to grow my investments.

Since I'm going to be dealing with much larger quantities of money very soon, I'd like to lower my overall risk a bit and diversify my portfolio so that it's no longer 60% tech stocks.  Ideally, I'd like for some large portion of my wealth to be a very passive core set of investments, while a smaller part is set aside for more active management in case I find particular opportunities I believe in (with a share of these profits reinvested into the safer core instead of reinvesting them into risky trades).

Would it be wrong to just pick a low-expense ETF like VTI and use it for the vast majority of my investments?  It seems like an easy way to get diverse exposure to the stock market, but I might be better off adding in exposure to other asset classes as well.  

Thanks in advance for any advice you might be able to share in response to my ramblings."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Using VTI as a substantial backbone frees you up to focus on your job, which is a big plus in my opinion. I do something similar with a large proportion in broad market funds so I don’t have to monitor those. Being bullish on markets in the long term is a way easier bet to make than to pick small cap value or different sectors."
03/25/2021,stocks,"So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think having a majority in an ETF is very smart. It is easy, passive, and diversifies your portfolio, in addition to having great gains. I also like the idea of having a smaller portion that you actively manage as well. Overall, this seems like a very smart idea."
03/25/2021,stocks,"No, it’s not wrong. You can’t go wrong investing heavy in the market because it’s there, forever.

If you’re not going to be actively buying dips and selling highs then I think you plan is good. Thumbs up on the Reits also."
03/25/2021,stocks,". I've always had 90% of my stock money split between EFTs. Split between small cap, growth , large cap.  (I tried internal stocks but they always performed worse for me). Rebalance every few years - Maybe more to large cap as you get older."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thank you for your feedback! 

My biggest concern is that such an ETF would only diversify my exposure to the stock market, missing out on other assets such as precious metals and bonds.  I don't know how big of an impact this would have on my overall risk, though."
03/25/2021,stocks,Thought I was smarter than the market. 9.5/10 you're most likely not
03/25/2021,stocks,"I like to think I'm pretty smart, but only because I'm smart enough to know I'm a big dummy.

I'll probably have \~15% of my total investments set aside for individual stock picks.

2021-03-25 18:57:29,stocks,"Came up with a long term plan but I have no idea how much % should I invest in everything. What would you do and what do you think? Hi! I'm 20 and from Eastern Europe which means a lot of US index funds aren't available to me. I'm looking to build a diversified but low risk portfolio, I'm not looking for day trading and I just want to buy and hold for 20+ yrs After doing my research, I came up with a plan of how to invest, and I think I'll follow the 80%-20% rule or 70-30% but I would really like your opinion on this and if you think my portfolio is balanced enough or too repetitive etc. Tell me what would you take out/keep and how much would you allocate because I keep hearing different things😫

1.VWCE FTSE All World - this is the one I'm gonna start with because now I have limited funds and slowly keep building my portfolio. But seems the safest to start investing in with the small amount I have.

2. AGGH iShares Bond core global aggregate UCITS (I still can't decide between both because my currency isn't € or $, but I think I'll go € as it's more used in EU)

3. WSML iShares MSCI World Small Cap 

4.DPYE iShares Developed Markers Property Yelid UCITS ETF.  Here idk if I should go DPYE or IDWP?
 Is it worth it more to reinvest it or keep it as distributing? Anyway it's a long time until I'll invest in this and I'll do it just because I want a more diversified portfolio and not to put everything in one basket in case something happens. Also I would like to get into real estate but still have to do more research to see if it's worth it.

What do you think about this plan long term?What would you take or what would you add? From my research, it seems solid. Now idk how much should I put into them. I was thinking 62% VWCE 20%AGGH  8% WSML 10% DPYE. 

But when just starting, until I get WSML and DPYE , I'll buy 70% VWCE and 30% AGGH. What's your opinion on this?"

2021-03-25 18:42:00,stocks,"$FNKO – Their Future of Margin and Revenue Expansion **TLDR** (posting at the top since this is a long post and I am occasionally a nice guy): FNKO sees the future of the collectibles market and is preparing for it. The company will see much better margins and likely a higher multiple as they become more tech-driven, which should make the stock go up to reflect their pivot. I believe the margin of safety is solid while the potential upside is very high, thus giving this an excellent risk/reward profile.

If you have ventured into your local GME store or visited their website then you are likely aware of or even potentially a fan of Funko’s products. FNKO obtains licenses from well-known franchises including movies, sports teams, comics and more in order to make their very recognizable and unique collectibles as well as apparel, games, and accessories.

Before talking about the future, let us look at the present. Their last quarter was fantastic, here are some of what I consider are the key things to be aware of:

* Net sales increased 6% to $226.5 million
* Gross margin increased to 37.2%
* Cash flow from operations increased 69% to $46.9 million
* Net sales of non-figure products grew 30% compared to 2019, primarily driven by strength within its Loungefly branded products which increased 51% in the quarter
* Funko's direct-to-consumer sales nearly doubled compared to prior year driven by continued strong demand on its e-commerce sites
* 68% of sales were attributable to evergreen content

**Here is my interpretation of the points above:** Sales are up and direct-to-consumer is a growing share of their sales as well as ‘evergreen’ content which essentially represents their products that are not tied to fleeting events. Additionally, they are growing revenues in product areas outside of the collectible figurines that they are known best for. The business as it exists today is healthy, which gives us a positive outlook for the future as it is as well as a good margin of safety for the stock price because of this since it appears to have a trajectory towards continued success and stockholder returns.

**But we are here for the big wins, now aren’t we? Let me pose a few questions:**

*If you wanted to take a healthy company with a loyal fanbase and have it earn more money without straying from what makes the company successful in the first place, what would you do?*

I would say that you would try to delight your customer base with new options to choose from to keep them happy and boost revenues while also doing what you can to not let those new options turn inventory management into a nightmare.

*If you had a company that made its money from physical products, what would you do?*

The way to make more money from physical products is to increase margins by cutting manufacturing and/or selling costs or by increasing prices.

*Who are FNKO’s primary customer types and what are some key characteristics of those customers?*

FNKO has a mix of customer types from people who like specific products that relate to a specific license to collectors who build complete collections of products to either keep or sell for a higher price. For either type of customer, I’d say FNKO is quite able to encourage multiple purchases over time (seriously, I haven’t seen an owner of a FNKO product only own one FNKO product) but the collectors are who I want to focus on for this post. Collectors want to build and complete collections, so if they are passionate about doing so with FNKO products, it would behoove FNKO to provide new ways of doing so in a way that makes it easier to verify and trade those collections if desired.

*Bro, what the fuck. Are you ever going to get to the fucking point?*

Now that I have shared the key things that I think is important to the environment FNKO is in today, I can now share what I believe will make FNKO rapidly grow their earnings: **NFTs**

*The fuck is a NFT?*

I think of NFTs as digital collectibles with built-in verification systems. These verification systems are essentially digital receipts that use blockchain technology to make forgeries more difficult and reduces the time it takes to check the legitimacy of a collectible when exchanges are desired. These are built into the collectibles themselves. For collectors, this is big. NFTs are still not very mainstream but amongst the collector community, I think these will be the future and will become extremely relevant. I personally do not collect things myself but it doesn’t take more than a couple brain cells to realize that collectors would want it to be as easy as possible to know that what they are buying is legit and as easy as possible to show people that what they are selling is legit. NFTs enable this to be done much more easily and quickly, leading to less fraud and a less painful experience for those who are into building/trading collections.

*How would NFTs help FNKO?*

As briefly discussed above I would say that if you want to improve upon an already-successful business, you would want to keep your customers happy while expanding margins and opening new revenue possibilities.

If FNKO begins to tie NFTs to limited-run physical items or sells limited numbers of the NFTs themselves, they could create a win-win for both themselves and the segment of their customer base that likes to collect, while also pulling in new customers who see a well-known company with well-known licenses creating content to collect and trade. With NFTs, FNKO can delight customers with new ways to collect while also streamlining the experience and solving some of the issues that make collecting difficult (verifying goods and trading them).

For FNKO, items tied to NFTs can be sold for more money which increases their margins since digital goods do not cost as much to build and scale (that is why tech companies trade at high P/S and P/E multiples). Because items are digital, it becomes easier for FNKO to react to trends in what customers want and can create limited release items and sell the NFTs right away and build/ship the physical items at a later date. Hell, they could also become a middleman between collectors and hold the physical items on behalf of whoever owns the NFTs and deliver at the request of the NFT owner (while picking up storage fees along the way for saving the NFT owners the trouble of holding/shipping the physical product while they wait to trade the NFT to a buyer. I do not know exactly how FNKO will implement NFTs into their business but you can see that some massive potential for fantastic customer/business win-win scenarios exists.

**Conclusion:** Because FNKO has a healthy business today, I believe that it has an excellent risk/reward profile because even if they totally botched the NFT rollout their existing business will be fine. I think NFTs provide a very enticing opportunity for the business to keep current customers happy, bring in new collector-customers, and increase margins while increasing revenues which would logically make the stock price go up due to both better earnings per share and a more tech-related multiple on those earnings.

*Is FNKO even planning on using NFTs?*

You’re damn right they are: [https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html)

*Are there other NFT-related stocks?*

Yes, but most of them are just penny-stock garbage and none of them to date have a combination of track record plus logical business sense anywhere close to FNKO.

**Disclosures:** I am not a financial advisor, I’m just an everyday idiot like everyone else here. The only difference is that I drink so much coffee that I occasionally become a functioning human. I am long shares, 4/16 20c and 25c as well as some 11/19 20c. I personally consider $50 my minimum target (both because I firmly believe it plus it is a lucky number for me since I had the same minimum PT for GME back when it was below $20). I have no idea what the ceiling is, but I just know that NFTs have way too much synergy with the existing business for me to ignore. I like this stock, my opinions are my own and I should probably be ignored because I ran out of coffee halfway through writing this.

Good luck to all, please have some semblance of logic with your plays if you decide to pick up some FNKO positions."
03/25/2021,stocks,I almost pulled the trigger when they were in the $10 range and I was just starting out.  Kicking my own ass for that one.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I could see this getting to $30, but I also have 100 Beanie Babies that say otherwise."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I have 300 shares of FNKO, someone posted about it just before the holidays and their DD was pretty convincing. Luckily, he was right, the holidays caused a surge.  


I don't think this is the same deal as Beanie Babies or Troll Dolls. They've tapped into a completely different market, first with gamers, then with a wider general audience, licensing recognizable characters from popular franchises. Beanie Babies doesn't have a video game or marvel movie demographic. And at this point, they've been around long enough to have a captured fanbase of their own that will remain loyal as long as there are new IPs to license.  


I'm not saying this will see an exponential explosion any time soon, but I think there's steady, long term growth potential."
03/25/2021,stocks,Amazing! They can bring it on the pops on the digital market just like street fighter Collector cards
03/25/2021,stocks,"The fad will die, and unless they start making playable toys from their license, as I don't see a big future for their current collectable model. And I'm sure there are plenty of kids wanting to open the parents collection to play with. And I would bet that plenty of people are going to soon say, dang I would like to see that wall of my house, instead of a wall of boxed items. And for the most part things produced as ""collectables"" are overproduced and will have no resale value, save for those truly limited numbered items. 

An idea for them to create unique items would be a build your own online, either with their extensive catalog of parts, or print at home.

To be honest I thought writing something similar the time the another posted DD on this company in Feb, and the stock has gone up like $7+ since then. 

As for their foray into NFT's, that seems everyone and the local liquor store is getting into... So that future is a different story on company value."
03/25/2021,stocks,Great post. I'm holding till $50. NFTs are a massive game changer. Get in early. People are just starting to realize how big this is.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You guys are braindead if you think people aren’t buying these... just went to the store in Hollywood and the line was all the way around the block. Sought after figures are constantly being sold out and I always see people in the mall buying them. They just have so many figures that it’s to the point were obviously some are more popular then others , so those go on sale. if they play their cards right, I can see them becoming more successful then ever."

03/25/2021,stocks,"My biggest concern with FNKO is their licenses, pulling a signal license would really hurt; Disney pulling their licenses would probably cause a death spiral.  I think they do have upside, but in the longer term their risk/reward is terrible."
03/25/2021,stocks,No one is buying these. They are constantly on clearance. Companies are giving them away to resale shops.

03/25/2021,stocks,"I think NFTs are a fad- imo FNKO has already run, if you're asking whether you should enter now you missed it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Great points, but FNKO has already run up big time so everything you've mentioned seems to be priced in already. The downside risk outweighs the upside at this time imo."
03/25/2021,stocks,"For every one they sell, I feel like there are 10 others that are next to them that nobody wants. I wonder what the cost is of making all the ones that don’t sell, and eventually go on clearance. Like there are probably 10 people in the world out there buying some obscure shows side characters funko figure. I also think that some of the figures are pretty generic and don’t even stand out as a specific character. Just my two thoughts on the product."
03/25/2021,stocks,"While I own 12 Funko’s and think they are great, come in a massive variety across all spectrums of tv/games/movies/sports. That said, it’s a collectors item, and I don’t see how it can be a growth stock. If it was $10 a share I could see investing, but at double that currently I’d have to be wary. It’s jumping because of the NFT craze which I don’t fully trust"

03/25/2021,stocks,They make playable card games.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Funko also has to buy licenses for all their pops.  Their own products do not do good, like Lego does. Will the price of a license brand be too much in the future?"

03/25/2021,stocks,"What incentive could Disney have to pull out the license? Their brand is not being damaged with ugly products, and they are strenghting the top-of-mind of their IP (movies, series, and all the push pf Disney+) with tangible figures. And is free money for them."
03/25/2021,stocks,The earnings report would speak otherwise
03/25/2021,stocks,"Idk how much thought you put in to this comment, but clearance is a way to clear their inventory. These guys have MASSIVE inventory for amount of different toys they carry so it’s not very surprising."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah if you feel like you are chasing then I definitely support your decision to let it play out from the sidelines. FOMO is how you lose money, so it is never a bad thing to stay out of a play if you don't feel a high level of conviction."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It might be to an extent. I have looked around and it seems that it isn't getting as much attention as other NFT plays, so I personally thing it will run based off of lack of attention and future growth opportunities but I definitely understand if you think otherwise.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Margins were 37%, so I guess whatever they are doing is working"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Funko figures are divided in ""Evergreen"" figures (Harry Potter figures, generic DC/Marvel figure, old TV/movies figures) and ""Current TV/movie/videogame"" figures. 

Evergreen growth is driven by organic growth in demand (new markets, new retail clients, new consumers) and ""Current"" is driven by current and future new IP offer. Sales in Q4 2020 were higher than Q4 2019, being 70% Evergreen products which speaks of the resilience of their Evergreen products. Before 2020, they were growing almost like 30% each year since 2017. 

The growth stock case could be justified with the company riding the wave of major Investments in IPs of streaming companies (Disney+, HBO, Paramount+, Netflix, Amazon Prime) + the rebount of movies and videogames pushed by the pandemic + new generation of consoles with new games + anime becoming mainstream."
03/25/2021,stocks,Ouuuuch
03/25/2021,stocks,"Go look at their investors presentation from the last call.

The primary difference between Beanie Babies and Funko is the shear number of licenses they have and their ability to secure new licenses every year. 

They have a ton of licenses and every time a new major film or TV show comes out, they have new figures to release with them. Look at all of the stuff Marvel and Disney have coming out this year. For each of those films and Disney + offerings they'll have toys. The same goes for sports and for music. The continue to release new stuff each year. Beanie Babies primarily had their animal plush items with a sprinkle of licenses here and there."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I never paid attention to Funko until Christmas time this year. All the 20’s adults in my group either received a Funko collectible toy/game, or gifted one to one of our kids. The toys ran the gamut of game of thrones, marvel, dc, the office, and Star Wars. Since then, I have started noticing them on people’s desks when I go places, they are everywhere. Will these be a thing in 15 years? Who knows, but I think they will be a thing for at least the next 5. NFT, while not a new concept, finally broke into the mainstream this year with tokens selling for upwards of 69 million dollars each! Regardless if it is a fad or not, NFTs are rather simple to create, and certification/tracking is built in as a feature. There will be some creative uses to cash in on the new craze, and I think $FNKO is in a good place to make it happen. 

Full disclosure, I am long 100 shares $FNKO."
03/25/2021,stocks,I definitely understand the worry there. I initially has the same thoughts but I feel that their licenses with popular brands will help prevent that. I don't see Marvel or sports losing their popularity any time soon
03/25/2021,stocks,"Oh great, can I borrow a half hour? I'll pay you back 45 minutes on Tuesday."
03/25/2021,stocks,The licensing deal benefits the most the Intelectual Property owner throught royalties of products sold. There is no incentive to price the license so high that Funko (or other companies) couldn't acquire them.
03/25/2021,stocks,Oooooo that’s a good point... who knows?? Only time will tell 🤷‍♂️
03/25/2021,stocks,"Agree with the future prospects of the company, but the potential dilution of 36% for current stockholders is a risk that needs to be considered. Acon Investments have 20m in 1:1 convertible shares vs 35m current shares outstanding. Acon is a Private Equity firm who acquire Funko in 2015 and just 2 years after that, they launched the IPO. They are betting their exit strategy in converting those shares (typical exit of a PE firm could be 5+ years). They exercised 10m before at ~$20 and the stock tanked after that. 

At mid-$20 stock price the probability for the price to go 36% down could be the same or more than the probability to go 36% up. 

Not disagreeing with the overall thesis, just saying that the opportunity at ~$14 had better margin of safety than current prices."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I don't have a crystal ball, but all you'd need is a competitor willing to offer more.  The point is not that I think it will happen, the point is that the majority of their business is being held up by forces out of their control, which equates to risk."
03/25/2021,stocks,"No one is buying them. Collectors have stopped as well, because they have no value. Even junk stores and resale can’t get rid of them."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes I have learned not to chase waterfalls. 

Nice username lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Very true, and in my head that's the difference between these and Beanie Babies - they don't have to stand on their own brand for resale."
03/25/2021,stocks,Puts on this guy's time
03/25/2021,stocks,"Excellent DD, I need to look into this and how it would effect the market cap at which prices. Good work"
03/25/2021,stocks,"With knowledge of how the licensing deal business works and the incentives of the companies, it is possible to have a decent conviction of how the forces will playout. 

Exclusive licensing deals are not uncommon, but they make sense in products without a huge differenciator (Like apparel, merch like cups, pens, cellphone covers, notebooks, action figures, etc) and with intelectual property who doesn't have the negotiation upperhand (Intelectual properties that are still in earlier stages of recognition). 

Funko main differenciator is the unique look of their vynil bogglehead figures (Note that in collectibles, companies compete either with realism of their figures (Bandai) or an unique propietary look (Nendoroids), being the second one a high risk/high reward in terms of acceptance by consumers). 

So it will only make sense that, in order for them to lose licenses, a new competitor shows in the same bogglehead category who has a huge amount of capital for: 1) Acquire exclusive licensing deals (which are more expensive due to opportunity cost) and 2) Develop a huge distribution network already (vs distribution network and fanbase of a company with 15 years of operation under current business model). 

Funko could have the same licensing moat that Lego have with a differenciate product and distribution network. 

The dynamics for a catastrophic scenario aren't there."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I appreciate you sharing your personal experience, but their finances tell a different story: (copied from above)

* Net sales increased 6% to $226.5 million
* Gross margin increased to 37.2%
* Cash flow from operations increased 69% to $46.9 million
* Net sales of non-figure products grew 30% compared to 2019, primarily driven by strength within its Loungefly branded products which increased 51% in the quarter

This is a solid company. 

I am not into gaming and I don't invest in things I don't particularly like, but saying that 'no one is buying them' just because you are seeing their toys on clearance is just wrong. It says right here that their net sales increased 6%. That is a definite proof right there. 

Their business is in creating new toys that are cool RIGHT now. So I am not surprised at all that they want to put 'out of fashion' toys on clearance to put out new cooler toys on shelves."

2021-03-25 18:23:55,stocks,"Valuation indicators? How & why to use the them? P/E, Forward P/E, PEG, P/S, P/B. 

How do you guys use them? 

Do you look at all of them? 

What makes you look at one over the other? 

Generally I've seen that the lower the better. But what ranges would you consider them to be ideal value, fair value, & over priced?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"You can't have hard numbers, like over X is overpriced. Because it depends on the industry, the stage of development, and your investment timeframe. And if a company seems over or under priced, there is usually a reason the market is over or under pricing them. For example, if there is bad press about a company, but you think the market is overreacting, and the company has strong fundamentals vs its competitors, then it could be underpriced. But if its just a dying, poorly run company, in a dying industry, then it could seem undervalued when its not."
03/25/2021,stocks,"the thing is no one knows the answer. In general, yes they say lower is better, but a lot factors play a role. For example:

\- If a company isn't doing so well (fundamentally speaking), then the valuation multiples will reflect that (a value trap). On the other hand, there might companies which have low multiples, and you determine that the market is wrong on that (value).

Then you have cyclical factors that play a role, for example when the economy is expected to perform better than current market conditions, an investor would be willing to pay more to buy the stock (multiples expansion). When the economy is expected to do worse than current market conditions, an investor investor would be willing to pay less (multiples contraction)

\- For a startup company that isn't profitable, the P/E multiple doesn't make sense (P/S or P/EBITDA might be more suitable), whereas for a mature company, P/E or P/B makes more sense.

\- Industries also tend to have homogeneous factors which impact multiples e.g. tech (high) vs utilities (low).

As you can see there's a lot of detail that can go into multiples, there's no hard number which can tell you whether Stock A is overvalued or undervalued. You have to consider a lot of factors to determine whether the multiple is too high or too low"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I never look at forward numbers, for starters."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I use PE and PB as part of my normal analysis. They are really only useful in comparing similar companies or companies in the same industry.

Pricing depends on industry and the company and industry. A PE of 30 might be normal for a tech stock while 15 is normal for a grocery store. It all just depends."
03/25/2021,stocks,"1. You need to compare P/E to others in their industry.

2. A low P/E isn't necessarily good, could mean that people don't think the company will grow much.

3. A high P/E isn't necessarily bad-- a lot of companies have seen earnings collapse due to COVID, price has remained elevated in anticipation that earnings will return to where they were. 

Generally, with tech stocks, I think a TTM P/E of 25 or less looks like a good deal."
03/25/2021,stocks,Those multiples make sense to compare companies within the same industry and with a comparable capital structure (higher debt ratio usually leads to a lower PE).
03/25/2021,stocks,"I don't think there is ever a clear bright line as to anything with a fundamental, but they are key things to consider. 

Generally, I keep it simple and compare PE and EPS to sector averages. If the P/E is too far out over a sector average it can be a red flag. If it is too far below, also a red flag. But even still both scenarios can represent opportunities. a high P/E could really simply be a rapidly growing stock and that is a company you need to be in with. something to keep in mind is prices are live, earnings are not. an inflated P/E may suddenly be not so inflated when earnings are updated...

And a low P/E could mean the company is actually crappy... OR the stock is way undervalued and there is growth opportunity. 

Fundamentals are screening tools to help you look closer, but they aren't enough alone. there are no strict guidelines, only general rules of thumbs."
03/25/2021,stocks,"As others have said, it really depends on the company/industry. For example for a company in a mature industry where little/no future exponential growth is expected (like oil, industrials, real estate etc), a 100 PE would be insanely overvalued.
On the other hand, for a rapidly growing tech company 100 P/E might well be decent value - a few years back Amazon had a P/E of 1000 and it has done exceedingly well since then. Similar story with Tesla.

So with tech companies, it’s much less about current earnings and much more about their future potential. More traditional businesses are easier to value in that their value is mainly driven by their current cashflows/profits, so PE can be a useful metric here to see if it’s over or undervalued relative to competitors.

Having said that, PE and other such metrics are only one single measure - you can’t look at it in isolation. As it’s not just about level of revenue/profits - but quality of profits too. Eg if they have decent profits but a lot of it came from one off sales or tax credits, that’s not so good. Also if they are making decent profits but they’ve been steadily declining over the years as they lose market share - also not good.

So at best these ratios will really be a starting point/one metric to use in combination with others. In deciding to invest in a company you have to look at the holistic/big picture"
03/25/2021,stocks,May I ask why?
03/25/2021,stocks,"The short answer is because Benjamin Graham told me not to. The longer answer is that projecting earnings, especially beyond the present quarter, seems to have a VERY low accuracy and precision rate. I'd be interested in seeing the results of some sort of study or metastudy on that.

I look at live P/E, which is based on ttm earnings, and I also calculate a P/E based on the 3-yr average of earnings. I calculate PEG based on that 3-yr P/E and the avg yearly growth rate for the last 10 years.

P/B I calculate yearly based on the latest 10-k (or foreign equivalent). Anything less than 1 is very good. Anything less than 2 is reasonable.

It's much safer to use a 5- or 10-year trend to try to ""predict"" future growth and earnings, and thus get a price target for a stock, than the company's self-reported projections. Granted, both have risk and inaccuracies. 

I don't pay attention to P/S, but not for any particular reason."
2021-03-25 18:22:21,stocks,"Fidelity or Vanguard? (Read below) So, I've got a complicated situation going on with my address. I would be able to open a Vanguard account right now (I have the application filled out and waiting), but Fidelity will not verify my identity and want me to mail something; I did mail it, and they said they need MORE address information.

I have about $50 to get started, $100 if I stretch, and realistically I'm more than happy to throw money in and let it grow. Ideally I'd love to get something in Tesla or Microsoft that should grow fairly consistently for a long while.

But, as I understand, Vanguard doesn't have fractional shares, while Fidelity does. So there's my dilemma.

Should I get vanguard, and find some small stocks to grow my money until I can sell them and buy bigger stocks? Or should I try and call fidelity and suffer through that? I'm just not sure if it would be worth it, since I don't really intend to be a super active trader.

Best points that no other brokerake match:

• you get interest in your money while they sit waiting for you to invest (even at near 0% interest rates we have right now you still get ~0.5% per year)

• the company is non proffit, the customers own Vanguard, it is NOT privately owned or publicly traded, you have money in - you are part owner"

I unfortunately don't think the ""average"" american is in that great of a financial position. Sure, we look at the rise of forum membership, but realistically that's a poor metric to use. I mean even if wsb for example has 8mil (haven't checked recently), how many actually post and respond? 

The narrative of young people putting their stimulus payments into stocks/stonks is based on terribly biased surveys (e.g. ""of 300 retail investors 75% will use the stimulus to buy stock""...great, but retail investors have already been using their paychecks for that as well).

But now, it’s trumps fault... boy this country has short memories.

We followed the communist China model of shutdowns, and still got sick. But that is trumps fault. 

How can it be his fault when the states were the ones shutting off their economies, not the feds?

Started investing seriously back in August, I had been killing it up 96% coming into March. Since then? Utter destruction. I'm now only up 11% since August. Part of that is because I got killed on GME a couple weeks ago after getting greedy and turning a 10k gain on it into a 5k loss. I know, I'm dumb for that. BUT other than that, I really do believe in my portfolio it just sucks to see it all down.

Holdings include: PYPL, SQ, SCHD, AAPL, PLTR, TRMB, ZBRA, DKNG, DIS, NVDA, CRM, and some others

I really believe in all of this long term and I hope/think it'll work out but fuck this hurts right now

EDIT: and Yes I know I should be divserified I owned some reopening plays like airlines, cruiselines but they have pretty much all returned to pre-covid levels and I think its time to move on I did make some money on those.

EDIT 2: For the people who are saying ""why are you made your still up 11%?"" Yes you're right I am up and I'm happy I'm still at a net positive but the market is out performing me which means I did a bad job managing my portfolio and would have been better off throwing it all in the S&P. And I know I did a bad job I got greedy and was chasing more gains instead of taking profit. I learned that lesson.

03/25/2021,stocks,"The whole “diversification” concept isn’t necessarily true for everyone. Diversification really only serves a few purposes. It can serve as wealth protection (hence a lot of wealthier people diversify, it would be foolish to put your 100m net worth into 1-10 stocks. They’ll tend to spread it further than just the stock market, eg. real estate and other fix income assets and even private investments). Diversification is also good for people who don’t want to research into the stock market, but want to also participate in market returns. 

When you invest in individual stocks, you shouldn’t really be looking for average returns because if you are, you can just diversify/ buy and index. 

The most extreme example I can give to illustrate this is this: take the s&p500, and say this year only 1 company out of the 500 companies will be positive. So in order to outperform the market here, you would need to have invested most of your money into that 1 company, otherwise you will be underperforming. For people who can’t be bothered, or don’t think they’re smart enough, they can just buy all 500 and have the average return. 

With regards to your holdings, if you did your DD and are in it for the long term (holding for years to come) just don’t open your portfolio. If you have extra money laying around, this is the perfect opportunity to DCA down or buy at discounts."

03/25/2021,stocks,"You have to realize that 2020 was a nonsensical year for returns. You could close your eyes and put money into almost anything after March and you’d make a shit load of money. It is not normal and I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but your gains weren’t due to you making smart or educated seasoned investor moves. You rode the wave of ridiculousness like everyone else and now in more of a bear market you can’t rely on blind picks anymore."

03/25/2021,stocks,Oh heavens buy more SCHD.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yea I really tightened up my portfolio with all the red into speculative plays on the watchlist only for now
03/25/2021,stocks,You're not even in the negative and you're complaining???
03/25/2021,stocks,"Welcome to the stock market.  Dollar cost average buying helps with this as you buy at all price points and as a buyer, low prices are your friend.  And though I haven't done dollar cost averaging over the past 12 months, I have invested a lot.  I buy many times (3-8 in general) as a stock drops.  I never yolo picking a single day to buy all I am going to buy.  Long term investing helps with this because you can survive the extreme lows and maybe reinvesting dividends will help with overall returns over many years.  The stock market on average made about 10% a year since the 1920's.  Expecting anymore than this is unrealistic.  When you were up 96%, that is extraordinary and maybe you should've sold at that point.  But the thing is we don't know if that's a bottom or a top.  You held and in hindsight found it was likely a top.  I'd say buy more, or hold, or take the 11%.  There aren't likely other choices."

That is kinda the point of how markets work.

Why did you expect to beat the market? What do you bring to the table in terms of allocating capital to companies?

There’s no reason to expect you’ll beat the S&P 500 based on intuition and hunches. What was your strategy? Why did you pick the stocks you picked?"

03/25/2021,stocks,had a stop loss get triggered on a day GME dropped from +40% to -15% in an instant and trading got halted and I couldn't cancel the order.
03/25/2021,stocks,That’s what I’ve been saying this whole time and I don’t understand why the narrative is “tech is overvalued and due for a correction.” VOO has a PE of 38 and NASDAQ with a PE of 40. I understand there’s some overlap between the holdings but comparatively it doesn’t seem like tech is overvalued.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Where are you getting these numbers?

VTV, Vanguard Value index, is trading at 20.5x earnings and 2.5x book value

VUG, Vanguard Growth index, is trading at 41.3x earnings and 9.4x book value

Much of the earnings growth of big tech companies can be attributed to temporary investments due to Covid. As the economy reopens, do you really expect tech to continue to outperform  other industries?

For growth, I can buy Tesla at over 1000x earnings, RBLX at 50x revenue, or for value or I can buy Intel at 12x earnings. 

I agree that some tech companies like Microsoft aren't overvalued, and some cyclicals are overvalued, but in aggregate I think value is looking better right now. Just going with dividend payer ETFs like VYM acts as a proxy for value while filtering out most of the unprofitable junk that just happens to have inflated book values."
03/25/2021,stocks,"2 months ago value stocks would have made sense but honestly many are worse than tech now. I am not even going to get started at how well doing travel is right now in contrast with their balance sheet.

This is not the time to buy banks which have just dipped mildly from ATHs. But AMZN with a record quarter and at somewhat ATL P/E ratio? I am praying hard for it to go below 2.95k atm and it’s one of my highest holdings rn. Innovation stocks that have tanked around 30% and still otw to being big players a decade from now?

GME was my only gamble and that was with money I was okay with fooling around with. I was managing my portfolio thanks though. Owned TSLA since pre split 100 days, sold it at post spot 700 pretty solid I’d say. Owned re opening plays since october, etc. Im a college kid who had 20K saved to invest. If i double it cool if i blow it all good lesson so I don’t do that when I actually have money and need to support a family. I was posting j simply bc this sucks and this isn’t fun maybe you have fun when the market goes down I don’t tho. I never said “oh no i need to panic sell everything wtf reddit why am i not a billionaire yet” i said “damn rip oh well i believe in them long term”.

03/25/2021,stocks,"with the volatility of GME that's basically the first rule of riding it, you don't set a stop loss. If you look into it further you'll see that the GME volatility is contributing to the down market across most of the blue chips too."

03/25/2021,stocks,This is why we tell everyone to get rid of those.

03/25/2021,stocks,Exactly.
03/25/2021,stocks,That is a rarity not the norm.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not only meme stocks, market rebounded very quickly after March 2020, or some stocks like Amazon were boosted by it. Even by just investing in normal stocks novice investor may have skewed perspective about normal returns."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You're right, people do think that, however I am annoyed with myself bc I got greedy and now them market is outerpforming me, so yes, I am up BUT I am failing to beat the market therefor I did a bad job."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You are thinking incorrectly. Your portfolio is aggressive and if you are less than 40 years old, you are taking on more risk as you should. 

The market is rotating away from your positions and you are taking some losses and pain. It’s temporary. 

You need to get mentally tougher. I trade stocks and options and I don’t worry about anything. I trade small and I trade a lot. 

Over the last few months I rotated and took profits and have more cash but I moved into AAPL KHC GM MPC MRO SPCE GPS (my son wanted that trade so I made the same trade) BAC (pick a bank) MP (rare earth material) STPK (I sell puts and take some premium) SPG (good dividend). 

Looking at AMD QCOM ALB (lithium miner) & MRNA (virus vaccine maker). 

I became more diversified because I am old but that doesn’t mean that YOU should. 

You can beat yourself up for a day and learn the lesson the market is teaching you, but only for a day. And then it is back to work. 

Again I trade stocks and options. The beauty of options is that they expire which forces you to make another decision. 

I normally buy 100 shares of a stock so I can sell a Covered Call. Or in the case of AAPL I sold a cash secured put at a strike price of 117.5 for a premium of $2.82 so I am offering to buy AAPL at $117.50 which is less than it is. I want to buy it at a discount. My Breakeven is 117.5 - 2.82 so less than $115. 

I’m up $62 on that option trade right now so I can close that trade right now and I’m done. I’m looking for $150 on that trade. 

Options involve probabilities. So you have to trade a lot. And I do. And I trade small. I’m only aiming for a single. Numerous singles. Small ball. Endless small ball. 

Drive your own ship and you only get to beat yourself up for a day. Good luck trading."
03/25/2021,stocks,This is a really ignorant comment.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You should be doing the opposite during a big correction. Sell your large cap, more stable stocks/indexes and put your cash into the solid growth companies that fell the most."
03/25/2021,stocks,"honestly, i think the key is balance. high-risk investments obviously require a high financial and psychological tolerance for said risk. but if you have about 10-30% of your portfolio in those bets and the other parts in more conservative assets, you dont have to deal with the volatility as much and you can still play the (more interesting) riskier bets :)"
03/25/2021,stocks,Nice! Always sell at a loss and by new better stock on it's peak. Repetat and some day you will have no money left. And will live happily ever after.

Well, yeah. But what I'm saying is you can't go close 100% tech then complain that ""it hurts"" when you lose all your gains. Look at tech indicies over time tech has bigger swings up and down than any other sector. 

Also PLTR is probably the most overhyped stock on this site. A consulting company with a homegrown analytics tool being heralded as the  next trillion dollar company, funniest stuff I've seen on stock subreddits in years.  I'm selling secured puts on it to get into it for cheap,  only because I want to try to cash in on a hype wave on this stock if that ever happens.

But CRM, AAPL are great. SQ and PYPL look pretty nice too. NVDA is a great company but they're probably overpriced too."

03/25/2021,stocks,"My point is that Covid pushed forward future investments into the present, creating an artificial and temporary boost to earnings growth that is unlikely to continue at the same rates.

For example, the push to work from home may have pushed investments in laptops, firewalls, video conferencing software, cloud software, etc, while other non-tech investment was deferred. It's quite unlikely this unprecedented level of growth will continue.

Nasdaq is very heavily weighted towards tech stocks. If you want to discuss tech vs value, compare tech vs value."

If you're picking stocks, looking at your returns vs passive indexing makes sense."
03/25/2021,stocks,only do this if you think that they are worth their current prices. The only reason I haven't backed the truck up on a lot of these techs is because I still think they are overvalued and don't intend to rotate from my value into growth yet

03/25/2021,stocks,"So you invest in a company because of its past performance??? Past performance is already priced in. Do you the company will repeat the performance? Beat the performance? Miss the performance? That is the entire point of earnings estimates, analyst price targets, etc. 

The economy is backwards looking. The stock market is forward looking. 

Why do you think re-opening plays like airlines are back at pre-covid levels? I can promise you it is not because they are making the same amount of money - its because people have prepared for and expect the vaccines to lead to mass reaping in the near future and for the companies to return to be profitable down the line. 

Why do you think inflation fears are hurting the market? Because people know unexpected inflation means lower EXPECTED FUTURE EARNINGs. 

The stock market is speculative and you make your speculations using estimates, trends, exceptions, and some luck."

As for PLTR, I agree there was way too much hype thats why I didn't buy in at 40 I bought in at 22 because it is not worth 40 per share right now but I do think they have lots of potential as a growing company thats moving into the commercial sector and has government contracts.

2021-03-25 17:38:45,stocks,Did I just accidentally short a stock because I sold a leap expiring in a few months? I have 2000 shares on SENS and when I thought about it since my investment had already doubled I considered selling covered leaps especially after the hard drop on the price. I however noticed that whenever SENS goes down I seem to make money some how and I just need to understand if I accidentally shorted it because I want to cover. I don’t want to short a company I love.
03/25/2021,stocks,If you sold a call then yes you will make money as the price declines because that call option is worth less than when you initially sold it to the market. No you didn’t short the stock. Unless you actually sell short you don’t short the stock.
03/25/2021,stocks,r/options & r/thetagang
03/25/2021,stocks,"Edited: 
In general my understanding of what it means “to be short” is to be in a position that becomes more favorable if the asset in question decreases in value.  

In this case you didn’t short the stock, you “went short” on the call option of the stock, which isn’t the same. Short selling a stock means selling shares you borrowed but don’t own, “being short” in options means you sold an option, as opposed to someone who owns an option, they are “long.”

If the stock price never exceeds the strike price plus the premium you sold the option for you profit. So in that sense, your position in your calls is benefited if the stock doesn’t do very well, but becomes less profitable the more the stock goes up.

TLDR: As far as I understand, no, you didn’t short the stock, but you will profit if the stock doesn’t go up much, or goes down."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I won’t tell you what to do either way. It depends on your personal profit interests and trading strategies. Speaking from experience though, profit is profit and worry is something to minimize. Most covered option sells are for hedging potential losses. 

Biggest thing is do you, no one gets it right all the time."
03/25/2021,stocks,So I should cover because I know 100% that it will be above 3.5 by then should I just buy the call option my self?
03/25/2021,stocks,No it’s fine I bought the call to close the position I’m really glad I did that because my mom uses their equipment and she’s never had any problems with it.

Not saying go out and blindly buy stocks without research that were mentioned in SA.   Most times it took at least 2 weeks of research and thinking for me to end up buying one of their recommendations.  For every buy there was at least 10 I turned down.  


To use SA well, you need to know what kind of investor you are.  If you are conservative might want to read Brad Thomas.  Much more liberal Rida Morwa.  You want Canadian try Trapping Value.  I am an investor that wants a minimum dividend of 4% or more with stock price appreciation and a very steady business that is not easily disrupted by retail customers.  


From SA learned more about REIT's like IIPR, IRM, DEA, & PSTL.  Also learned a good deal about BDC's like GAIN, GLAD, MAIN, PNNT, NLY, ETC., .  Already knew a lot about REIT's & BDC's before SA just got a better understanding.

2021-03-25 17:20:50,stocks,"Help me understand this Wash sale rule in taxes? I have a question about wash sale rule, if I buy on 3/10 25 shares of a XYZ stock @ $100 then on 3/13 price drop then I buy more @$80 then value  keeps dropping and on 3/15 I buy 50 shares @$60 so far I own 100 share@$75 average down then again the The stock price keeps falling then decide to sale all my 100 shares on 3/20 at $ 50. Now I have a loss of $2500. Why I can't claim this as a loss if I didn't keep any share? I know I bought share 30 days before but I didn't keep any or bought anymore after 30 days. My Robinhood taxes form added all this as a wash sale loss.

I know the point of prevent Wash-sale rules is to prohibit investors from selling a security at a loss, buying the same security again, and then realizing those tax losses through a reduction in capital gains taxes. I didn't sell to claim losses and buy again  I did it o avoid of losing more money and I never when back in."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Something isn't adding up.

I am familiar with the wash sale rule. The wash sale rule affects your cost basis when you buy a security you recently sold if you had originally sold at a loss. It doesn't affect whether or not you can claim a loss once the security is sold, it affects how your gain/loss is calculated.

If you buy at $100 and sell at $50, you've recorded a $50 loss. If you buy back in at $45 a week later, the $50 is added to your cost basis and the loss can't be claimed because it's accounted for in your cost basis. Instead of a $45 cost basis, you have a $95 cost basis. If you sell at $50 again, your new result is a loss of $45 and this can be claimed for tax purposes. If you buy back in though the whole process repeats."
03/25/2021,stocks,Are you sure you did not buy it again within a month?  In any case if you end to take the loss just sell it and don't buy it back.  Either that or you need to contact the broker for a mistake on your Consolidated 1099
03/25/2021,stocks,"You lose in a fight, the guy who beat you up falls to the ground... so you then fight that guy and win.

That’s a wash fight. Your loss doesn’t count as a loss anymore because you won the fight overall. Even if you barely won and you’re still fucked up more than you won. 

Your loss is washed out by your greed of revenge.


But if you get beat up, but end up winning by a lot... who cares at that point. Your win out weighs your losses. 

You have 30 days to wait after a loss before you can re enter a fight and win again to not be hit with a washed fight.

Hopefully that is translated enough to help. I might be off a bit"
03/25/2021,stocks,"It was my understanding that is a tax loss. I thought Wash Sale doesn't kick in unless you close your position and reopen it within 30 days so: Buy XYZ @ 100, sell XYZ @ 75 within 30 days and buy back at 70 you'll still be down 30 bucks per share. Maybe I'm wrong though"
03/25/2021,stocks,Did you buy XYZ stock or options again at any point that year?
03/25/2021,stocks,">Now I have a loss of $2500. Why I can't claim this as a loss if I didn't keep any share?

That's not a wash sale, what you did. You sold at a regular loss of $2500, so you should be able to claim that loss on 2020's taxes. 

Seek out a tax advisor. They should be able to clear the air around your situation."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Exactly!! that's what I'm arguing about but even a TD ameritrade tax expert says it's a wash sale. Let me tell you exactly what happened with me.  Last year  I bought 600 shares of UBER within a week ( beetween 8/15-8/20 )trying to average down but then I realized it was going to keep dropping then on 9/7 I sold them all for a loss of $ 2000. I never went back in uber and still Robinhood added all the $2000 as a  wash loss. In another occasion I bought  2 calls of $ FSLY ON 8/5 then the stock keep falling then I bought 2 more calls on 8/7 then on 8/10 I realized the loss is to much and sold it all 4 calls at the same time for a loss of $3500 . I never bought any other stock or security of FSLY  again.
I don't understand why ? if I never buy again after I sold."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm sure I didn't rebuy any same securities and I reached out to 2 of my brokers and  they don't specifically said what I did wrong they just said you can't buy any same securities before or after 30 days I guess the wash sale occurs in beetween even if you didn't keep any share.
03/25/2021,stocks,"No, that sounds right. Its not a wash sale unless you try to by the same or an identical security."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I thought that too but no, if you buy shares during a period of 30 days and sell all at loss you can't claim this losses. Make no sense. So the way they see is if I sold the fist 50 shares at loss it will be a wash sale because I bought 50 more a couple days later and the last 50 that I bought is a wash sale because I bought 50 before, even if I sold them all in one shot."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I know you can't buy any again stocks including options after 30 days to avoid wash sale, so I didn't. In one case I bought it after 60 days and other case never went back in that stock. That's why I don't understand why the IRS don't let me claim as a loss, I didn't keep any security that I purchased 30 days because I sold out everything and I never buy again not even after 30 days."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I agree with you but I guess we are wrong I haven't confirm this with a tax advisor yet but what my broker said I can claim a loss only if I bought them all at the same day or more that 30 days prior   but if I buy them in different days within a month and sell for a loss this lost will wash sale each other, then I can't claim as a lost even if I didn't keep any. 

Lesson to be learn."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The only possible explanation would be the exception for ""substantially identical"" securities. I'm not a tax expert but if you bought what someone with more knowledge than myself would consider ""substantially identical"" to the securities you sold then the cost basis for those securities should be increased proportional to the loss you recorded on the original securities. Under no circumstance should losses be permanently washed out. Talk to a tax professional other than TD Ameritrade or file a complaint is all I can advise you to do at this point.

I guess it's worth mentioning the following scenario:

You buy 1 XYZ stock at $100 cost basis on 3/1/2021

You buy 1 XYZ stock at $80 cost basis on 3/5/2021 (Blended cost basis is now $90)

You sell 1 XYZ stock at $50 cost basis on 3/9/2021

It's not entirely clear to me if the full $40 loss would be added to the cost basis or if only $20 of the loss would be added to bring you back to the full $100 cost basis, but the loss may be added to the cost basis of the remaining 1 share as part of the wash sale rule."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I really think it's only if you buy back the same 50 shares after selling. If you simply buy and sell at a loss, you get to claim the loss. if you buy back, you don't."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You right I  need to talk to expert, I did talk to a Td ameritrade tax expert but I wasn't convinced and they don't explain to me exactly what I did wrong here just that the purchase I did fall in the 30 days ""wash sale rule"". What I came in conclusion is that the last 50 shares that I bought will wash sale  the lost of the 25 @$80 then the sale of this share will wash sale the first 25@$100, then this 50 shares will wash sale the lost of the the last  50@$50. 

I thought this rule is only made to prevent you to claim a loss then later repurchase same stock."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm confused too I called Td ameritrade to help on this and their tax expert says it's right, I can't claim as a loss even if I didn't buy after selling. Only if let's say I bought 100 shares the last time I will be able to claim 50 as a loss, the other 50 will be wash sale because I bought 50 similar  couple days before."

Now with inflation fears and the rising 10 year yields instilling fear in the market, the market took a bit of dip (still near all time highs tho) and the Nasdaq wenth thru a correction (down 10%). This dip scared away a lot of new retail investors who think ""stocks only go up"", which then caused the market to go down more, scaring more ppl into selling... etc. Couple that with the insanely overbought SPACs, tech stocks, and even COVID plays that are back to their pre-dip highs (airlines, hotels, cruisliners) and I think what were witnessing is a return to a healthier market although its gonna be painful to get there."

03/25/2021,stocks,"My idea: Stimmy gave $$$ to both companies and the middle/lower class. When average people have money, they pay off their debts and put $$ into the CPI which inflates and acts as a brake on stock market prices. Explains why banks are doing better than most sectors in the last week. However, once the stimmy is out and the net value of companies in the stock market is closer to their actual net value, then we will see market prices inflate like what happened in April 20-May 20 of 2020. My prediction is that we will see a reversal of the bearish divergence by April 2nd and signs of a unholy yeeting by the  16th. 
Edit: the reason I think it’s a divergence and not a downtrend is that the Fed announced they won’t be raising rates anytime soon and raising rates is what usually causes the market to downtrend."

>It seems like everyone is selling.

Well yeah because they have bought in the past and are already making good profits. Especially since most stocks are still close to all-time high prices, far away from what the current financial statements prove, and have already capitalized much future growth predictions. Even hodl-forever-Buffet himself has sold some Apple.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Someone replied to me to ask why May is a red month, but I can’t find the comment so I’ll just leave this comment here for shits and giggles. 

It’s based on the last 70 years of statistical data. Historically May has had zero returns over the past 70 years so we tend to see a bearish market. April, November, and December are statistically very bullish times while August and September are bearish on average for stocks. This is where the “Sell in May and go away” saying comes from. October through April is where the bulk of stock market returns come from historically. 

Month: Number of times with positive returns;  number of times with negative returns = Average return. 

January: 42 up years; 28 down years; average return = +0.98%
February: 40 up years; 30 down years; average return = 0.00%
March: 44 up years; 26 down years; average return = +1.06%
April: 49 up years; 21 down years; average return = +1.36%
May: 41 up years; 29 down years; average return = +0.09%
June: 36 up years; 34 down years; average return = +0.03%
July: 40 up years; 30 down years; average return = +0.93%
August: 38 up years; 32 down years; average return = -0.26%
September: 32 up years; 38 down years; average return = -0.57%
October: 43 up years; 27 down years; average return = +0.68%
November: 47 up years; 23 down years; average return = +1.42%
December: 52 up years; 18 down years; average return = +1.37%

We can’t predict the rise and fall of a stock, but we can time the market based on these statistics but as I was just reminded, you have to remember to factor in unprecedented news that may see the fiscal year become an outlier to the norms - i.e. a global pandemic sees the market behave in a very unusual way to the norm. Apes buying GME because they “like the stock” is not the norm. So we aren’t in normal circumstances and therefore May might not see it’s usual dip trend in stocks across the market."

look at how things have been the last couple weeks, then remember that without the stimulus checks things would probably be even worse. (biden talking about raising taxes also doesn't help)

at the end of the day, people just need to remember that they hold the same number of shares that they did before, and as long as they were investing in good companies that they intend to keep for the long haul, they're still going to come out on top. look at the prices of all these companies before/after the 2008 crash."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Getting rid of what you don't believe in.

Holding and waiting out till this volatility shitshow stops. 
As soon as cash is available, buying any dip at a price level below 10% the portfolio cost avg.

Stonks will ONLY go up (long term), the rest of the ongoing FUD is just opportunities for rich players to get richer.

This is the way (for me :)


BTW premarket is shit.
Unless you have insider info about something due to be announced its NOT worth wasting your gray matter (or sleep) over that crap"
03/25/2021,stocks,"lol

not sure why anyone ever thought most stimulus money goes into the market..not one family/friend put money in the market..most people will just buy shit with free money rather than invest/gamble"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Do you feel super confident in the market right now? It doesn’t sound like it. If you don’t, neither does anyone else. This is how momentum works. 

News that comes out of nowhere can have explosive effects on the market in the assumed direction. Heavily anticipated news, like the relief bill, get more and more priced in the longer they’re anticipated and the more the news is baked in, the more it becomes a sell the news event. This is market psychology 101. You’re not the only one who saw the stimmys coming.

With that being said...I do believe the stimmys increase the overall money in the market, but a lot of those folks see an unstable market in growth stocks and are waiting for the dip or a confirmed bull market, so the effects may be delayed and everyone isn’t buying $1200 worth of stocks overnight. This will assist us with momentum when we bull through 400 on SPY."
03/25/2021,stocks,Top economist were predicting a recession between 2018-2020 because the market might be overvalued. Maybe it's time for the market to contract. Capitalist markets have a cycles of boom and bust.
03/25/2021,stocks,Am I the only one on a buying spree right now?
03/25/2021,stocks,It looks like the stimulus checks hit everyone’s bank account at 11am ET
03/25/2021,stocks,They are boosting the market. Have you not seen GME and AMC today?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Welcome to the world of a bunch of people that talk out of their ass and have no clue what they are talking about. Lol

Investing is a long game. If your in it for a quick buck then you're going to learn alot of lessons, like this one, the hard way."
03/25/2021,stocks,"There's no such thing as timing the market. Nobody can do it, nobody ever will. They'll make predictions and get some of them right but so does a chicken that picks between up or down randomly for a year."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I doubt most people dropped it in stocks, a lot of people used it to support their vices', weather it be gambling, drugs, booze, or prostitutes.."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Because at best it's a cautiously optimistic take, and at worst are just plain stupid. To be fair, none of us can predict market trends, and I doubt the folks shilling that know how to evaluate what's really going to happen outside of one or two factors, when in reality the equities market is so complex and linked to so many micro and macro variables. Besides, everyone in America knew the stimmy checks were coming, and whatever impact it would've had on performance would've been priced long before the stimulus checks were confirmed."
03/25/2021,stocks,The market will go up as soon as people don't expect it anymore..
03/25/2021,stocks,Never JUST listen to what people are saying! It seems to always be wrong short term somehow
03/25/2021,stocks,"Buy growth stocks you feel confident in, and stop checking your fucking portfolio. Just let it sit"
03/25/2021,stocks,Not with the uncertainty of the present administrations ability to right the ship!!!
03/25/2021,stocks,Stop timing and start investing.
03/25/2021,stocks,Well that is because the stimulus checks were already priced into much of the market after the democrat sweep. You want to trade off of new news not action
03/25/2021,stocks,Buy the rumor sell the news
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think many new investors possibly invested when it was the $600 stimulus if they were caught up and didn’t have excess bills as $600 doesn’t go so far.   Plus people saw returns and forward movement on stocks.

At the current times all those gains have mostly disappeared leaving new investors searching for other investment opportunities.  Also $1400 means potentially paying down or off a loan, getting a month ahead on mortgage or rent, buying something nice for yourself, putting a down payment on a new car or holding it for a nice vacation as many people are sick of being pent up and indoors.

I, myself put my 600 in stock and this stimulus only put around 200 in as I don’t have as much faith as I once did in stocks as after doing some research you see how over valued a lot of stock is.  Also I haven’t learned the best way to collect gains so I missed out on a lot of potential profit along the way.

Now I am playing a bit safer and once I get far enough ahead I take the money out of volitile stocks and put it into ETF’s.  As I hardly know as much as I think I do."
03/25/2021,stocks,I didn’t invest. I needed new tires
03/25/2021,stocks,"There is the FED and stimulus check and interest rates, well those together going like rock papers scissors. The longer the play thus more is lost. But there a winner somewhere."
03/25/2021,stocks,Give it a week probably 2 IMO the first stimmy lagged 2 weeks
03/25/2021,stocks,"The markets are going down because treasury yields are going up, so banks and businesses are buying them as a result. Supply and demand."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I haven't gotten my stimmy yet.  When I do, some of it will go to market, where it can join with it's brothers and slowly fade red.  I'll be green later, it's all good."
03/25/2021,stocks,Buy Amazon !!!
03/25/2021,stocks,"People are ending up using it to buy necessities due to increasing prices (inflation). 
Also a ton of people that got the last two didn’t get this one. 
Like me! Lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I pointed this out a billion times, but despite what CNBC boomers want everyone to think, the vast majority of people were spending their money on everyday things: rent, food, medical bills, etc. Generally not things that will impact stock prices. Sure maybe Walmart and stuff got a little bump, but that was already priced in and isn't a huge bump anyway when spread out over time and diluted by other spending. People weren't all using that shit on iPhones and Xboxes and Teslas. And they sure as fuck weren't dumping it into Robinhood to trade. 

Sure, maybe SOME people were, and those are the ones that get highlighted on TV. But a very very very small percentage of them were. Reddit over-indexes on young people who don't have serious expenses, so more people here were talking about using the stimulus to double down on NIO and GME (or joking about it at least). But it was a very small percentage of people."
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s also tax season. Not everyone gets a refund. Taxes are due by 4/15. Have to pull $ out of somewhere to make that payment.
03/25/2021,stocks,"We bought more last night AH while on our way to the casino. Gambling on our way to gamble, why not!"
03/25/2021,stocks,"People taking gains for the year,  unemployment running out, some tech prices were getting too high, to go into other aspects of the market, people realizing they have to pay taxes on unemployment, people having to pay taxes for the big gains some made this last year, taxes in general, for me, I think that maybe a couple of reasons for a little dip."
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you're Walmart, stimmy checks are boosting the economy just fine."
03/25/2021,stocks,It doesn't boost the economy when the stimulus is going to the landlords and the landlords just hold on to the money.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I was skeptical of the stimulus really pumping the market when I considered all of the competing dynamics...

*  Some people (many) may decide to take some profits and buy things in ""the real economy""--vacations, cars, etc.
* Stimulus check spending may be used on the real economy as well, especially for those behind on their bills or wanting to have some money stashed away in savings
* I'm not entirely sure that the institutions really know what to do with their money--I definitely think they're rotating out of tech, but not convinced they're rushing into value/reopening plays quite yet"
03/25/2021,stocks,Nope opposite job report is gud why stim this is why market fails fed is dumb
03/25/2021,stocks,"Citadel is literally shorting the entire market to stop AMC and GME from rising lol, and its only going to get worse."
03/25/2021,stocks,I think the Rich sold and took everyone’s stimulus check when they invested. Bamboozle
03/25/2021,stocks,"It’s hedge funds, they’re taking money out of ETFs to short stocks like GME. Causing the entire market to plummet."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Fucking idiots might have bought some food. Paper hand fucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&#x200B;

WTF. Why should people gamble their money in the markets if they have nothing else. Why is this even a fucking question."
03/25/2021,stocks,They were supposed to boost the economy.  Big difference.
03/25/2021,stocks,Fear of stability and Short sellers are driving it down.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ever heard buy the rumor, sell the news? Yeah, the second round of stimulus was priced in months ago."
03/25/2021,stocks,Well they did at first..
03/25/2021,stocks,I thought the stimulus checks were supposed to be for $2000.
03/25/2021,stocks,Now is a good time to add if you’re not a bag holder which I’d bet many of you are at this point.
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m just here for the karma please
03/25/2021,stocks,"I put a small portion of my stimulus into the market, but I needed to spend most on necessities. Times is tough. I suspect many are in the same boat or worse off."
03/25/2021,stocks,"OP the first thing you need to understand is that stock prices move on hundreds of millions of dollars of movement. Retail has very little influence on the market. The recent GME/meme stock phenomenon is very new and all are low market caps.  It is impossible for retail to move Apple, Microsoft, Pfizer, Walmart, etc."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Takes a couple of weeks...there is a lag time as happened in January, after the $600/pp stimulus; this one is over twice as much...also not everyone gets it on same day...gig workers who may have not filed last year...or who may have filed but did NOT provide their checking account number on Form 1040 will receive checks by mail"
03/25/2021,stocks,Today was the first day I've been green in two weeks. I'm up 2% on the day and down 20% on the year.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Some apes go all in right away, others buy in gradually, gotta take that into consideration"
03/25/2021,stocks,Even a child can tell you that simply printing money doesn’t work.
03/25/2021,stocks,Haven’t got mine yet but when I do I’ll do my part.
03/25/2021,stocks,It's all about momentum.  If the stimulus checks had been earlier they would have maintained the momentum and this downturn might not have happened.  But they were late enough that the market had already lost momentum and once that happens it will continue in a downtrend until it stabilizes. The checks are not sufficient for it to change direction because people are less likely to spend them on an unstable falling market.
03/25/2021,stocks,Nope all the sheep are saving for a rainy day 😂
03/25/2021,stocks,Weird.  It's almost as if printing a shitload of money and doling it out to the masses is a shit idea.  Remember that next time a socialist tells you otherwise.
03/25/2021,stocks,There manipulating the markets to suck all the stimulus checks into market
03/25/2021,stocks,"What stimulus checks? The one’s that we’re deleted or cut in half or 1/4 compared to the last round? I got $1100 for my family of 4 and owe $2600 in taxes, so I’m getting -$1500 essentially. 

Go ask unmarried Rosita with 10 kids and Dad working under the table what she’s doing with her $8,400 of your tax money. She ain’t buying stocks. They’re getting chrome rims for that Silverado so they can flex on the other day laborers in The Home Depot parking lot."
03/25/2021,stocks,Can’t time the market. But you can certainly average. But as things slide. But as they rise. Biden will be dumping trillions in stimulus. Stocks only go up.
03/25/2021,stocks,"If it were up to me, we’d have a long 2-3 year bear market to purge more than half you noobs. 🤷‍♂️"
03/25/2021,stocks,So most people didn't get there stimulus until yesterday........
03/25/2021,stocks,Unscrupulous people look at the stimulus as a way to take money. Your going to need to ride or die!
03/25/2021,stocks,Investing free money is a gamble
03/25/2021,stocks,"Since no one can predict the market those posts and comments are probably best seen for entertainment purposes only. And for what it’s worth, my portfolio has been in the red the last month. Stay strong!"
03/25/2021,stocks,Honestly this uncertainty will be over by April and we can chill then
03/25/2021,stocks,"There is increased demand because of the stimulus checks, but supply is not able to keep up because it is easier to stay at home and not work if the government is paying you to do so. Also the current supply chain disruption in the Suez canal will lead to higher prices as well. Demand is increasing but supply can't keep up. Basic micro econ 101."
03/25/2021,stocks,Buy the hype. Sell the news
03/25/2021,stocks,Where are these posts? I didn't see anyone promising anything
03/25/2021,stocks,"Tweeted everything that can be tweaked, bought all the dips I can buy. Now all that’s left is to avoid looking at account again until the Nasdaq hits 14k. Gonna be a long 2 months."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think the stimulus boost was baked in on the last ATH, I still haven’t gotten mine yet along with millions of people so the expected injection of money hasn’t come instantly."
03/25/2021,stocks,Lol don’t time it then. Three of my favorite companies have been dying for no good reason. I just got my annual bonus and I’m pumping it all into them.
03/25/2021,stocks,They were already priced in...
03/25/2021,stocks,All the dumb SPACs going public is eating up the stimmy demand
03/25/2021,stocks,"maybe that GME cultist who speculated that the 'hedgies' were shorting everything in the hopes of bringing down GME was right.......................

lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Well... I don’t get stimulus check anyway so , oh well..."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Nah, they’re just hoping most of us panic sell at a loss so they can just take those checks back. I think April will turn around."
03/25/2021,stocks,The GameStop situation is tanking the market around it
03/25/2021,stocks,"Huge short ladder attacks across the market from HF ""war rooms"", hundred of stocks dipping at the exact same time across the market."
03/25/2021,stocks,"99% of the stimulus package that was sent out last year went directly to big business to support the stock market. The newest stimulus package focuses on letting people buy food, pay rent, support smaller businesses and boost the economy.   


Massive difference between the two.  


The government also had to print a lot of this money which weakens the USD.  


When the £3T infrastructure bill gets passed, expect the same type of action in the stock market.   


The US government has officially stopped reporting how much money it is printing."
03/25/2021,stocks,Follow GME and you would understand why everything else is going down
03/25/2021,stocks,I didn't even get mine yet...
03/25/2021,stocks,"Have these guys not learned that they are supposed to BUY during these bloodbaths? 

Guys, the market isn't going anywhere. It always goes back up. This is your chance to get prices from 6 months ago in many disruptive innovative company stocks that are likely to break out this year."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm honored
03/25/2021,stocks,I dont even know if my portfolio has any blood left to bleed
03/25/2021,stocks,buy THAT stock that everyone hates
03/25/2021,stocks,Mine has been for the past few days! But it’s the nature of the beast. Just power through.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Everyone keeps saying this, but I look at most of my stocks and go ""this isn't a deal, you could have bought for less then this a few weeks ago"".

And my one stock that actually is down a lot (TSLA) is still up so significantly from where I bought that I'm obviously not going to buy more on a dip."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Look at the Dow in October 2008, the peak of the market right before the crash. I think it’s at like 13,000pts it’s now over 30,000. If you had bought at the peak before the crash, you would have tripled your money. As long as the businesses you invested in are solid they should bounce back. And if it takes a year, you pay less in taxes"
03/25/2021,stocks,"They have shorted index funds. Everyone is affected. 
Stop looking at red and green and actually start looking at the volume and what's happening behind the scenes 👍"
03/25/2021,stocks,That's because the whole market is getting fucked in the ass by hedgies to get out of the GME desaster
03/25/2021,stocks,"i can already see half of my turbos getting closed D:
tesla, tsm, nok and others"
03/25/2021,stocks,[buy the dip](https://youtu.be/hGeEXrR84XE)
03/25/2021,stocks,"Mine too, buy the dip cost average down and hold! That’s what I’m doing!"
03/25/2021,stocks,Mine too! Sucks when you’re the one left holding the bag...
03/25/2021,stocks,I honestly cried a little bit this morning
03/25/2021,stocks,I was down 2% early market and now I'm up 1.5%.... it is a very volatile market.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Mine was as well, I was losing up to 6k euros, then I sold my VLDR bought AMC during the dip yesterday and now I am on green with a 11.500,00 profit lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,Stay strong Apes...good times will come
03/25/2021,stocks,"I have a one stock that has me up for the day by 23% overall. Yesterday was a bloodbath across the board thoug, so no where near where I was a month ago."
03/25/2021,stocks,I think people want to eat first
03/25/2021,stocks,"just... buy what you believe in and hold for divs.

this is a dull way to play but a beneficial one in the long term."
03/25/2021,stocks,Can I get an inverse this dude ETF?
03/25/2021,stocks,This sounds more like a WSB post with the exception of actual introspection occurring ROFL
03/25/2021,stocks,It seems like every decision that you make is wrong. Every instinct that you have is wrong so therefore the opposite would have to be right. Just do the opposite of all your natural instincts and you will find success.
03/25/2021,stocks,Sell into strength buy into weakness.
03/25/2021,stocks,"lol bro just do the opposite of what you would've done, its that simple"
03/25/2021,stocks,I was hoping to make profits in the 3-6 month timespan and that definitely didn't happen.
03/25/2021,stocks,I’ve been invested in the same stocks for 3 months give or take and have gone down -14% overall
03/25/2021,stocks,People forget that more than 90% of businesses in the US are private and don’t trade on the market...
03/25/2021,stocks,It's shocking how many people don't understand this.
03/25/2021,stocks,Right but it’s also not unreasonable to expect that a certain portion of people who get checks don’t necessarily need them to pay bills immediately and some portion of that money will end up directly in the market. Especially given much hype and frenzy there has been around getting into the market lately. FOMO is at an all time high.
03/25/2021,stocks,As if nobody uses the stimulus to invest
03/25/2021,stocks,Say that to to millions to billions going to big cities and bailouts
03/25/2021,stocks,"Help me understand this, majority of sales are at large public companies, no?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"You'd need to give people a lot more than a measly $1400 to make a difference.

This is just a bloated dictatorship tossing scraps to an incredibly beaten and malnourished dog. Just enough to stop the dog from devouring everything. Nothing more. It will not boost the economy and it was never intended to. If you listen to the government as absolute truth? You're naive and you'll be a terrible investor. 

America is on borrowed time. I'm watching everyone wonder ""BRO WE GAVE THE DOG A BONE AND IT'S STILL DYING WTF"". Unreal detachment. The dogs fucked mate and if it doesn't kill you it's certainly going to die. 

I liquidated everything about a month ago at the top. I'll buy back into the ashes I guess. Everything I have is in a non dollar currency also."
03/25/2021,stocks,"All of the relief is going into the market via QE, people need help therefore they go to where the money is, not that difficult."
03/25/2021,stocks,My retail store is seeing a bit of a boost. My stocks are not 😂
03/25/2021,stocks,"The hope was that this higher stimulus would have the same effect as previous payments - retail investors would pour that money into the market and give it a boost. It's early, but it will be interesting to see how most people spent the money. It could be that more businesses are opening as it gets warmer, so there's more interest in spending and less in investing."
03/25/2021,stocks,"This, this, this!
Economy health does not link equally to the stock market!"
03/25/2021,stocks,They did boost the market.  Before people got their checks.
03/25/2021,stocks,Buy PLTR. Got it.
03/25/2021,stocks,If something is proven doesn't that kind of make it crystal ball-like
03/25/2021,stocks,"I have a crystal ball, but it has yet to do anything but just sit there.  Im still waiting for stock predictions, but none yet"
03/25/2021,stocks,"No you're just purposefully being lied to.

""BRO IT'S LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY SAY IS GOING TO HAPPEN ALWAYS HAPPENS BRO THAT'S CRAZY BRO HOW CAN THEY CONSISTENTLY BE WRONG LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME BRO IT'S WILD""

I laugh hard when I read this. Every time.

Yes you're right it's an amazing coincidence isn't it."
03/25/2021,stocks,The charts point down... Just saying
03/25/2021,stocks,Remind me! 60 days
03/25/2021,stocks,Remind me! 30 days
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah I wish I was just now getting into the market.  It's a great time to do it.
03/25/2021,stocks,Right before taxes due too.
03/25/2021,stocks,Is it?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Every government and every company has its own fiscal year, so I'm not sure what fiscal year you're referring to. The federal government's fiscal year ends September 30."
03/25/2021,stocks,So basically the slaughter will end in April?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Exactly. I kept seeing things about stimulus causing investing, and half the time the polls were stupid. If anything, the news was trying to convince people to buy stocks so that institutions could grab more profits."
03/25/2021,stocks,The idea of the stimulus boosted the markets. The actual money doesn’t do that lol
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah but then again the government didn't get them into a lot of accounts until yesterday the 24th which they did say would happen so i'm not even sure how this threads relevant.
03/25/2021,stocks,When their reporting that they polled 38% of ppl going to drop their stimulus directly into the stock market it had me thinking the same thing.
03/25/2021,stocks,Most of us who are invested in the market did not get a stimulus checks for the first time or this time.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Shouldnt be the mere fact that people thought bullish boost the market a bit?

I did kinda think people would dump some of the cash into some investments"
03/25/2021,stocks,This is a stupid take. That's like asking someone who's broke why they don't have their new blu-ray player yet when they don't get their paycheck til next week
03/25/2021,stocks,"So money doesn't affect the economy is people know about it, got it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think it's because many people who aren't really in desperate circumstances making $72,000 a year as a single person view this $1,400 as an opportunity to use it towards the future (i.e. investments) - but perhaps we're wrong!"
03/25/2021,stocks,"You really overestimate people, I have 4 tenants who haven't paid rent in 6 months. One just got a new car and another who I follow on Instagram posted a video of himself unboxing a ps5."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Who said it was ""those in desperate circumstances?"" Households making 6 figure salaries as high as $150,000 received over $5,000.

Mine would've went into the stock market if I didn't have to use it to pay my taxes."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Mostly it's echo chamber. The idea that an emergency solution created to give cash to people during an economic downturn was going to impact the market in a meaningful way is, honestly, kinda far fetched. But if enough people on the news and on the web keep saying it, other people will repeat it and at that point it's just considered a legit news because so many people can't be wrong

Those money are supposed to go into the real economy, for things like commodities or food or consumer goods or whatever. There will be for sure countless people that are going to chuck their SCs into their trading apps...but are those people going to be so numerous to have a *meaningful* impact on the market? Come on."
03/25/2021,stocks,Because it’s done so on previous stim checks?
03/25/2021,stocks,Because it's $1400 for nearly everyone.  Obviously those paying bills and buying food aren't investing outside of WSB.  For most families it's an extra ~$5k in a savings account with near 0% interest.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Cause its a K Shaped recovery and more people have money in savings than ever before....this does not discount those who have been unable to work but that is < 10% closer to 5% of people out of work those people most likely aren't investing anyway. Keep in mind people who have kept their jobs have less ways to spend their money. Can't go on vacations, restaurants, bars, shows. Part of why so many people have been upgrading their homes so much."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Because the checks went to those earning far too much and those that weren’t in “desperate circumstances.” My sister-in-law earned right at $150k last year, she is in her mid 20’s and married to a person in medical school that earned $0 but has very rich parents. $2800 went to them and immediately went into Botox/ lip fillers/ savings. I understand that issuing it to a tighter group of people would have been administratively problematic, but I would imagine there was quite a bit each time that went directly into the market."
03/25/2021,stocks,Not to mention that the 1400$ they gave out to some people is going to cost every American citizen approximately 5600 to pay back.
03/25/2021,stocks,"33% down = 50% up

yesterday 38% down after other down"
03/25/2021,stocks,and chem trails.
03/25/2021,stocks,Not at all. It was looking for a while like $1.2 was going to be the number. And right now the market is bracing for corporate tax increases as a result of the infrastructure bill. I’m Canadian btw and don’t follow this as a political interest but work in sales and trading so this is closely tracked.
03/25/2021,stocks,"The 1.9 trillion stimulus definitely was not expected then. It looked more likely than not that you'd have a Republican senate, which would have likely meant close to not much more happening at all after that 900 billion stimulus.

Shafer's firing squad played a major role in changing that and is likely the full explanation for that random market sell off on the first day of the year ahead of the Georgia runoffs. By then it looked fairly likely that the R's would lose thanks to his stupidity (and I'm not a R, BTW)."
03/25/2021,stocks,How could the stimulus be priced in? Wasn't the expectation that people would use their stimulus checks to directly purchase stocks causing their price to rise?
03/25/2021,stocks,"> 1. The stimmy news was already largely factored in November, however it was factored at 2k not $1400 

literally nobody was talking $2k in november. everyone was talking $1200. (that being said, $2k could have been priced in back in january when biden/warnock/ossoff were screaming ""2k checks immediately"" from the rooftops then won those senate seats on their empty promises)"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Don’t trust anyone who says they know what the markets will do, anonymous stranger or not."
03/25/2021,stocks,But they posted rocket and apes emojis while telling we're the good guys fighting the bad guys!
03/25/2021,stocks,go back to r/gme to post your nonsense.
03/25/2021,stocks,"There are always similar concerns. Go back to any year and there are catalysts on the horizon that could cause a crash, doesn't mean they will."
03/25/2021,stocks,It's super bizarre. The only reason I even know there's a 'correction' is because of people screaming about it here. Sure isn't showing up in my portfolio page as anything I'd even notice.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I literally went from owing the gubbment, to getting money from them...TF is going on?!"
03/25/2021,stocks,"The idea i believe is that the retail investment public knows that at some point soon it's going to find it's way into specific companies, thus raising demand for said companie's securities."
03/25/2021,stocks,"All I know I ain't selling. There's a reason I bought into these stocks because of fundamental, economical reasonings and gut feelings. A good mesh of them all."
03/25/2021,stocks,Most likely answer
03/25/2021,stocks,Ladder attacking also?
03/25/2021,stocks,I haven’t received any stimulus checks also
03/25/2021,stocks,"That’s great but many of us are invested in singular companies and not all ETFs

03/25/2021,stocks,"I do my own research bud, maybe look at yourself in the mirror?"
03/25/2021,stocks,i did
03/25/2021,stocks,The infrastructure bill is going to be paid for in raising taxes on people making over 400k a year. At least that is what they're currently saying. Also infrastructure spending is probably some of the best spending you can get. It's essentially a jobs program which means more money moving around
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thank god you’re not American, we have enough of your types as it is."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Sure, and poor people move the markets so much."
03/25/2021,stocks,so does my 401k
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, Joe needs to back out of more trade agreements so China can build their own behind our backs. Slapping some fat tariffs on our allies would also be great if he has the time."
03/25/2021,stocks,"For OPEC countries Biden is a godsend. For America, he's just expediting the process of the world going off the dollar as the main reserve currency. Increasing the M1 money supply by 360% in a year will lead to hyper inflation and the decline of the dollar."
03/25/2021,stocks,Trump literally handed out more money in stimulus than Biden.
03/25/2021,stocks,Why would you make this comment on r/stocks?
03/25/2021,stocks,How many guns do you have now?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Zoom out the graph a bit. You'll change your mind about the ""on-sale"" thing"
03/25/2021,stocks,same hahaha all 3 of mine
03/25/2021,stocks,the media isn’t paid to tell you what you can profit from
03/25/2021,stocks,net loss even
03/25/2021,stocks,under 75K AGI got a 600 and a 1400

03/25/2021,stocks,What’s a portfolio
03/25/2021,stocks,You know it’s bad when your brokers app plays  “the death March” as it opens.
03/25/2021,stocks,Emphasis on the “do not know”. I haven’t logged into my broker in at least a month.
03/25/2021,stocks,Nobody makes me bleed my own blood
03/25/2021,stocks,"Bought Intel back when it crashed to mid 40s. Sold most of it at 65

A company that pretty much everyone hates and a stock that also everyone and their mother was badmouthing back then. 20billions profits and 80billions revenue per year. I just don't get how a company with these kind of numbers was valued that low."
03/25/2021,stocks,To the Moon
03/25/2021,stocks,"> I'm obviously not going to buy more on a dip.

I question that logic in a general sense...  Whether you already own some or where you bought at probably shouldn't figure into whether you think it's a good idea to buy more.  

I mean, there are SOME reasons one might not -- wash sale, portfolio balance, etc. But I don't feel like I can't buy BRK just because I have some already.  It's a separate trade.  I track them separately. FWIW, I have 3 different open BRK.B trades, which is the only reason I mentioned it specifically."
03/25/2021,stocks,Can you explain?
03/25/2021,stocks,idk why you’re getting downvoted. it’s true. feelings aside if you look at the facts it’s 100% true. the Beta on GME is -11 last time i checked. They are destroying the rest of the market as a fuck you to GME investors as they (attempt) to not go broke.
03/25/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/25/2021,stocks,No more $$ left to buy the DIP.. Been buying DIPs for last 3 Months :(
03/25/2021,stocks,Stocks are like a bar of soap.  They become more slippery the more you handle them.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Here's the play, I just write down what I'm about to do, execute, incur enormous debt while the community gains. For the greater good."

03/25/2021,stocks,"It's been 3 months, try and calm down a little."
03/25/2021,stocks,How dare they.
03/25/2021,stocks,"What percent of sales are from publicly traded companies though?

You can have a thousand small businesses combined that don’t come anywhere near the sales of Costco and Walmart."
03/25/2021,stocks,There was a lot of speculation people were going to dump the checks into stocks even if that wasn't the goal
03/25/2021,stocks,Half of congress doesn’t understand this
03/25/2021,stocks,"For sure but if it had a huge impact on the stock market that implies the stimulus was a complete waste because people didn't need the money and just decided to pump it into stocks. If that was the purpose of the US government, fine. But I highly doubt it since the stock market has been roaring, and has not needed any stimulus. The economy itself is their concern.

Truth is though most Americans are neither complete gamblers nor very regular active investors (even if it has been a huge deal on Reddit lately). A few niche tech stocks getting a boost due to this type of investing does nothing for the market as a whole. These investors barely make a dent in the share price of the companies that actually matter in relation to the stock market index as a whole. 

So chances are, most people just spent it because they either needed it to make rent and bills, or wanted some new luxury item. Some of this will impact public businesses but the results would only show in the markets if this lead to significant earnings beats for these companies. 

My suspicion is though, that the stimulus checks themselves will have minimum impact on most public companies and the stock market.

All my own opinions and guesstimates, potentially a load of horseshit."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Money going into the market does not mean boosting the market. The value of things aren’t increasing because people are throwing more dollars at them. When they don’t get any returns in a couple of days, then the panic selling starts and it just slowly burns off that cash."
03/25/2021,stocks,That portion is pretty uncertain and can be just trivial
03/25/2021,stocks,"The majority of Americans, pre-COVID, were living paycheck to paycheck. Retail investors don’t really have any influence on the market."
03/25/2021,stocks,"retail investors receiving stimulus checks don't make a huge difference in the overall market, the market is being controlled by hedge funds and other institutions with billions moving around"
03/25/2021,stocks,That says a lot about retail investors' impact on the market.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, but those companies don't usually sell necessities. Nobody is buying new iPhones if they can't pay bills or are in a pinch for food. And the majority of public companies sell consumer goods that arent necessities."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, a lot of people have yet to learn of “Buy the rumor, sell the news”. This was priced in the minute it was even discussed (to an extent and then incrementally more as it became clear)."
03/25/2021,stocks,"They did boost it, but someone tied the boosters on pointing the wrong way."
03/25/2021,stocks,Wish I waited until today lol. Bought at 24 a few days ago but I'm not sweating it
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, the problem is significancy level is 5% and we have less statistical power."
03/25/2021,stocks,Weird. Did you shake it?
03/25/2021,stocks,Yes fiscal year ends in April when taxes are due. I’m like 95% sure. (Pls correct me if I’m wrong)
03/25/2021,stocks,I think they are referring to tax season for the US and how markets normally dip that time of year with expectations that people are closing some positions to pay for taxes
03/25/2021,stocks,After Biden was elected stimulus got priced in. When stimulus actually came in it was a classical sell the news event
03/25/2021,stocks,I still haven't got mine.
03/25/2021,stocks,That was a polling of like 500 stock interested people.  There is no chance that many people still have that much disposable income to just throw in the market.
03/25/2021,stocks,[This comment sums it up well](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mcxmx4/i_thought_the_stimulus_checks_were_supposed_to_be/gs62c0j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)
03/25/2021,stocks,There’s not a lot of people who fall into that category. Those people have bills to pay too instead of putting into investments or they’ll put it in savings
03/25/2021,stocks,"Good point, I didn’t realize it went out to everyone I’m Canadian so I assumed it was restricted to certain income levels"
03/25/2021,stocks,Thats a very small amount of people and certainly not enough to affect the overall market.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Apologies, I’m Canadian so wasn’t aware it went to everyone... that’s kind of absurd"
03/25/2021,stocks,More higher earners qualified for the first one than this round. It makes sense there would be less discretionary money to spend on things like stocks.
03/25/2021,stocks,"First fallacy, correlation does not equal causation.

But I'm sure some fraction of this money is reaching the market, so the second fallacy is, just because new money shows up at the market, it doesn't mean it's willing to pay the Ask price.

The shown price doesn't go down because people enter Sell orders, it goes down because people buy at a lower price. All it takes is some whale of an ETF doing a rebalance after a few stocks in it have a massive volatility event to move all of the prices at once. I think SPY has more money in it than the stimulus (I'm going to look that up and edit if I find out this is wrong)

Edit:  this article suggests 56B of the stimulus reached the market right away. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/investors-poured-record-56-8-billion-into-stock-market-funds-as-stimulus-checks-arrived-11616177039

03/25/2021,stocks,Lol do people actually believe this shit?
03/25/2021,stocks,Up 758% for the year!
03/25/2021,stocks,"> Wasn't the expectation that people would use their stimulus checks to directly purchase stocks causing their price to rise?

Deutsche Bank surveyed less than 500 people who were *already* investors and they said they were going to throw some stimulus money at the market.  Did this subreddit think that was going to move the market?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think the vast majority of people are using the stimulus to pay bills, pay down debt, etc...

I wasn't convinced for a moment when polling that said otherwise. Polling in general can be incredibly flawed, depending on the instrument used, number of participants, and demographics including socioeconomic status."
03/25/2021,stocks,People love to throw the word “priced in” around here to sound smart

Pls leave politics for the political subreddits :)"

The market just had the best 12 month rally in history. That was not normal. What would be normal is the market cooling off and trading sideways for a while."
03/25/2021,stocks,In a year this will look like a little blip.  Keep buying in and never sell.  The only reason you should even begin to consider selling is if you’re invested in garbage companies and you don’t see them recovering within the next 3 years.
03/25/2021,stocks,Long game.....remember that
03/25/2021,stocks,Yep same boat.  Went from +50k to -10k.  Feels bad....
03/25/2021,stocks,yep everyone talks down on a popular stock but the fact is they overstepped in a criminal way and it is unprecedented. People go from bashing to wishing they bought in so quick
03/25/2021,stocks,"TSLA is nearly half of my portfolio, so I'm already over-allocated to it. I have over $200,000 worth of shares.

In normal circumstances yes I can see wanting to add on a dip, and I definitely do that. But not when you're still up over 1,000% and that position is half your portfolio."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Go in my comments, I gave someone a huge text wall explaining what strats are viable and I touch on what's going on behind the scenes. Retail is getting fleeced. 

See the comments here? See how people feel? Their pussies hurt, whining, depressed, boo hoo? That's good to see. They're capitulating, which means we're near bottom. Watch for volume to enter the market and wait for disbelief. People will talk shit about the volume and say it's a bear trap and pretend like they're smart for not acting on it after losing for weeks in the slide down. 

Use the stupid people on Reddit like an indicator. That's what I do. It works great. In January, everyone was giving me shit for telling them they were dumb for not taking profit and the ""stonks only go up"" crowd was a bunch of dumb beginners who confused their easy money with skill. 

The collective is stupid, wrong, slow, and always overreacts in both directions. That's why 90% fail. Also, be wary of thinking many people saying the same thing is the same as truth. If many people are all saying the same thing, they're not always right. Information doesn't work that way in the market. There have been plenty of times ive been told I was wrong by many people. 

Guess who's never blown out an account and has less than 10% drawdown with less than 50% market exposure? This moron. I also called the 2020 crash and bottom. Using the same methods. Watching stupid peoples emotions and building a macro view from the bottom up."

03/25/2021,stocks,"It's weird that this sub is so against the GME craze. It looked idiotic to begin with, but they've been measurably correct about the squeeze situation so far."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It’s actually true. There’s a literal metric ton of evidence to prove it. GME is probably one of the only safe hedges against the massive broader market correction this is likely to cause as large funds with way too much short exposure get margin called and forced to liquidate their big successful long positions. Look at the 6 month chart for all the major indices and big tech, there’s inverse correlation with every spike in GME, on Jan 28th, feb 25th, and today, March 25th. Each are 21 trading days apart, which is the maximum length of time market makers have to settle the massive amount of failure to delivers. I agree that WSB is a wretched hive of scum and villainy, but they’re actually right this time. The r/GME sub is literally loaded with crowd sourced due diligence backing up this theory, and today it’s playing out for the 3rd time out of 3. I highly recommend studying what’s going on at the moment, and if you don’t have the stomach for wild volatility, don’t buy any GME, but I hope you have some dry powder ready for when SHTF. This is the hedge fund and institutional equivalent of the “pouring cement down the toilet” during the 2008 housing foreclosure crisis. They’re absolutely trying to take everyone down with them, and beg for a bailout after. You think the govt wants to lose an entire year of Covid stimulus money into the pockets of degenerate gamblers? I suggest informing yourself about what’s going on with both sides of this historic trade. Otherwise, ignorance is bliss."

Ultimately, as much as I hate seeing these red days, if the stimulus checks are actually helping people in need more than fueling investing speculation, that's probably a good thing on the whole."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yea for sure -- I was just pointing out in reply to the above where the idea of stimulus checks driving price comes from.  I don't think its entirely people conflating the 'economy' with the 'market'.
03/25/2021,stocks,very true

03/25/2021,stocks,"This is different though, the news boosted the market, but you’d expect to see an influx on stimulus checks going in to further boost the market.

Just think if we weren't doing anything to combat this economic disaster lol. The market would be 10 feet under ground right now, much worse than it is doing.

Do you know that the covid act includes things because direct payments, such as $600 per month per child and $300 boosted unemployment? That definitely affects the economy and stock market.

What actually sums things up well is that things could be worse."

03/25/2021,stocks,"I mean it's the second biggest cash injection directly paid out to Americans in the country's modern (if not whole) history, so while you may say it's a fraction of the population it's still way more than at any other time besides April 2020.

Also, while a single $72k/year guy in Boston will receive this money to invest, this is also equal to a $55k/year Kansan, a $60k/year Chicagoan, etc.. There are a lot of people without debt who will use this money to invest, just like the last time around."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's pretty ridiculous. I typically lean to the left and think more help for lower income households is absolutely needed, but the stimulus check portion of the bill is a feel-good publicity stunt. I know a retired couple with 7 figures in investments living on a six figure pension who got the full amount. I have friends with well over $50k in savings and above median incomes who got the full amount. I myself qualified for most of it as an engineer just because I'm already in the fortunate position of maximizing my 401k, so my adjusted gross income is a lot lower than my gross pay.

I think overall it's good that the stimulus finally went out but it's a shame it wasn't bipartisan."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The checks started phasing out at $150,000 and were fully phased out at $160,000. For single filers the phaseouts were half that amount.

There was separate stimulus for those that were desperate- federal benefits increased unemployment payouts by $300/week, so some states were paying over $800 a week in unemployment. Many people were making more on unemployment than they were working, although it wasn't as bad as last July when people were getting $1100 a week on unemployment."
03/25/2021,stocks,"> Apologies, I’m Canadian so wasn’t aware it went to everyone... that’s kind of absurd

the irony is that lots of people want more because they think canadians are getting the same thing every months. they genuinely believe that every canadian has been getting $2k/month from the government since last march.

there's a pretty substantial portion of americans who are completely detached from reality."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I haven't reviewed any data on the subject so my beliefs are entirely anecdotal, but over 50%? It is purely based on my social circle I guess but most of the people I know benefitted from the pandemic e.g. working from home, no longer having to commute, less to do with everything closed so more money for savings. Peak unemployment was 14.8% in April 2020, compared to 3.5% pre-covid. So for argument sake 10% of the working population was unemployed at peak, the number fell fairly quickly to \~6% after peak and remains there. So while I certainly understand a relatively high number of people lost their jobs, I've heard little about salary reductions or any other negative effects (although I'm sure there was underemployment). 

If we say peak unemployment of 14.8% people, and chop in another 5.2% of people who experienced some sort of salary reduction/unemployment. It gives us 20% of the US population that may need some sort of assistance. So 65 million people, given 320 million US population. Approximately 127 million people received checks. Almost double the amount of people you would think needed them.

Also don't get me started on the phaseouts, I think \~50% of the US population makes less than $40,000 annually. To have it start phasing out at $150,000 for a married couple is absurd."
03/25/2021,stocks,Nah let’s just keep printing money bruh. What could go wrong?
03/25/2021,stocks,"ever looked at a 20 year graph of gamestop's price

lol what the fuck"
03/25/2021,stocks,I don't know what this sub thought I don't really follow it too much. Personally didn't think it would make a huge difference. I just don't see how you can price in a price increase due to people buying the stock?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Eh, any amateur investor knows that the market is always priced in on rumors. By the time the event happens, the market knew it already. The market was prepared for the folks who threw their stimulus in.   

The cliché: ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" is mostly always right."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Every dip of the meme stocks or even slow growth has been attributed to ladder attacks.

I like the idea that someone would think the entire tech sector is under a ladder attack."
03/25/2021,stocks,yes
03/25/2021,stocks,I didnt know it!
03/25/2021,stocks,"Listen man you can keep getting into the nitty gritty but the fact of the matter is this has been a shitty week, hell, shitty two months for a good portion of people."
03/25/2021,stocks,And billionaires are hording billions of it annually. Your point?
03/25/2021,stocks,"A lot better than what Trump did, cutting taxes with 0 plans on how to make up that revenue. I'd rather see some benefit in the form of drivable roads than it just going to some rich person's pocket."
03/25/2021,stocks,"No definitely not all of our allies hate trump, where have you been??"
03/25/2021,stocks,"You said Biden would be worse for the economy than Biden, citing the stimulus as a reasoning, when Trump has sent more money than Biden. I'm pointing out the incongruency if your argument."
03/25/2021,stocks,Lol that's kinda pathetic 🤣
03/25/2021,stocks,Warren buffet has been doing investment all wrong.
03/25/2021,stocks,"No one can know the bottom or the top. There are still good opportunities out there, but there is also too much interference from different agendas.

What I know is that (without any further specific context) if something is close to all-time-high prices and already 60-100% up in a short period of time, then chances are that it's not a very good opportunity (to put it mildly)."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the reminder. Fortunately I do believe in my picks so I'm not too stressed. At the end of the day, I'm actually alright.

On red days, I check the stocks once and forget it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Honestly losing the gains doesn't hurt as much as losing the capital. I mean, the gains were unrealized so whatever. Anyway, let's just hang in there. No paper hand bullshit right now lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,This is one week where I'm happy that I have 100% in the index
03/25/2021,stocks,Looking at my deep red BB and NOK positions...
03/25/2021,stocks,"It occurs to me that a correction like this presents a golden opportunity for a lot of new-investor apes who've been blindly chasing nothing but Reddit YOLO and FOMO bets recently to actually learn about market fundamentals, and potentially move to better positions that they've actually researched and thought about."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I got sort of lucky and sold off in February, but then I moved 30% back after the dip ""correction"" looking for a bounce. Guess I'm holding part way untill we see where this chop is going. 

(I was mostly in index and ETFs, Nasdaq heavy, now I'm bond / money market heavy with some Nasdaq leanimg index funds)
I'm very happy I got out of the small caps early.... not so certain about  tech yet."
03/25/2021,stocks,Of if you’re realizing gains.
03/25/2021,stocks,I sure hope so.
03/25/2021,stocks,Lack of diversification is definitely a reason!  :-)
03/25/2021,stocks,">a bunch of dumb beginners that confused their easy money with skill


I'm terribly sad to say this is me."
03/25/2021,stocks,"This is why I sell any non-“blue chips” as soon as I’m up like 30%. Right around that time, it starts getting discussed heavily online (this one is going to the moon!), everyone jumps on board, and almost predictably within the coming days institutional investors sell off and capture profits. I just try to beat them to the punch."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Well, we got some volume today. But because we've been sideways in real estate, banks, materials etc for the last two weeks (eg CLDT one month chart) I closed out some long calls in the green and bought 2-3 week puts in those sectors. Idk, I guess I don't trust it yet. I still have plenty of longer term calls (that are down 20-30%), so this move won't be a huge mistake since I only bought about 3% of my portfolio in puts today. For now I'm still playing swings until we have 2-3 days of upward movement and volume."
03/25/2021,stocks,I agree...there might be a fantastic opportunity coming up but there hasn’t been enough pain yet.  When the posts change from “hodl” to its been fun but see you later...then is the time to buy.
03/25/2021,stocks,"To be honest, it’s not even a matter of skill, (unless you’re trading around that is). There’s an old story about the worst timed investor of all time. This guy saves and invests since 1970 something, but doesn’t do it in increments like he should- instead, he saves up his money, and then dumps it all into the S&P the *day before* a historical crash. 

So dude saves up for years, dumps it all in the market, the next day it’s black monday. Instantly down massively 


Saves up for years again, dumps it in, the very next morning, dot com crash. 

Then again, saves up for years, dumps it all in- the very next day, 2008 crash. 

This guy can’t catch a fucking break. Worst timing in history, over and over again. But he’s not a paper handed bitch. He holds. 

You would think he’s a failure, but this guy actually retires a millionaire. So if you can’t beat the worst timed investor of all time, even with the advantage of being able to average down and DCA, that means you’re capitulating, and you’re a big giant pussy."
03/25/2021,stocks,"> That's good to see. They're capitulating, which means we're near bottom. 

People with <3mo investment experience capitulation, is not the same as market capitulation, or even retail trader capitulation. I would hardly call our current situation capitulation.

We're back to where we were... on March 1. This is hardly anything in the grand scheme of the markets"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Can you do me a favor? I am a person who heavily identifies with you, I too intuitively understood that the market is getting kangaroo’d because the powers that be are shaking the fools from their coin. 

Could you provide me some education resources for understanding what the sharks ACTUALLY are doing and the strategies they employ? I have actively avoided education up until this point actually, because like you I detest the masses, I want to know exactly what the top 20% of people who get 80% of results do, and how they understand the market."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Anyone could have called the 2020 crash, specially the shorters who helped enable it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think its because most of the people in GME are very, very intense. Including myself a lot of time. People that haven't been there since the beginning get a culture shock type feeling. They haven't experienced what has led to many GME people to feel the way they do about the stock. There is a valid reason behind the intensity in my opinion because there is people doing analysis of GME getting literal death threats for posting it. There is so much happening right now and if you're not going through the DD frequently you just don't know what you don't know."

03/25/2021,stocks,That's definitely the plan. I don't need the $$ for the next 2-3 years. But still. It's frustrating
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I was looking for that info or an estimate but couldn't find any."
03/25/2021,stocks,What a terribly ignorant belief to hold.
03/25/2021,stocks,The entire market is sliding but companies like Walmart will hold up compared to growth stocks.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Oh for sure, once it's over 100 we won't care. I am trying to dump a lot into it while it's sub 30, but I'm running out of money haha"
03/25/2021,stocks,We actually got the last deposit almost instantly which is why not getting anything yet has me a little nervous. We actually already got our refund processed and deposited the day after the stimulus got signed. I checked the IRS tool and it says we're eligible and that when they have an exact deposit date they'll update the page.
03/25/2021,stocks,Because they’re being sent out in waves. Many are in the March 26th wave of stimulus disbursement.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I have been, it just confirms my eligibility and bank account info and says the page will update with a payment date when they know."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The post is about stimulus checks, my comment is about stimulus checks. The comment I refer to is about stimulus checks. No one is speaking on the relief bill as a whole."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm saying the people that you described are a very small amount.  Yes it was a ton of cash overall but very few people actually had money to just throw in the market.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ah yes, a few people who maybe didn't need something got it so that means the whole thing was bad[*ly done].

>but it's a shame it wasn't bipartisan

That was literally impossible with the current make up of our congress.  The income requirements were less (more strict) this time around and you still had full opposition.  Nothing was going to make the other side support this."
03/25/2021,stocks,Meanwhile Canada capped at $500 per week with taxes owed 😂😂
03/25/2021,stocks,">I haven't reviewed any data on the subject so my beliefs are entirely anecdotal, but over 50%?

WTF?  You honestly think over 50% of people that received checks were in the upper income brackets had so much disposable income they could spend said checks on stuff like ""Botox/ lip fillers/ savings""? 

>I've heard little about salary reductions or any other negative effects (although I'm sure there was underemployment). 

Then you need to read more.

>I think ~50% of the US population makes less than $40,000 annually.

Jesus Christ.  I'm literally speechless at this lack of logic.  Over 50% fall into the category mentioned in your previous post yet 50% of the population makes less than 40K?  I just cant."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Good thing we're not, but thanks for confirming you're just trolling and not actually that stupid."
03/25/2021,stocks,Past performance dosnt necessarily indicate future results

03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m a Turkish guy but please don’t think about camels and arabs immediately. Our nation has been so ignorant by voting for Erdogan for the last two decades. Hopefully, Z generation will end this. I live in italy btw."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I didn't cite any specific reason for Biden being worse for an economic recovery - much less raw stimulus dollars spent. Go back and read it again. I posted what I believe, and specifically stated as such.  If you don't agree with it bang the downvote like you already have and move on.  Stop trying to win a nonsense argument on Reddit."
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s so much fun. #redneckshit
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m hoping my May were back on track as the economy reaches full health again
03/25/2021,stocks,Wait....  you mean to tell me that you guys actually make gains??
03/25/2021,stocks,You haven’t lost a thing until you sell.
03/25/2021,stocks,i've lost capital at this point...shit sucks
03/25/2021,stocks,Can you be more specific? I want to learn your ways of not hurting :)
03/25/2021,stocks,"Same - not 100%, but somewhere around 70% in blended stock funds and indices, about 20% in my employers company stock, and the rest pm’s for play. Still down, but not as bad as some of the tech heavy portfolios"
03/25/2021,stocks,Here’s a tip. If you aren’t willing to do deep research into company’s before buying then just put all your money in VOO or VTI.  Slow and steady wins the race for most people most of the time.
03/25/2021,stocks,Same.
03/25/2021,stocks,Nah. I think BB will bounce back with 5G innovations. but NOK. I'm not so sure :(
03/25/2021,stocks,Blackberry and Nokia? The crown of the pre-iphone times. Good deal 😂
03/25/2021,stocks,"Agreed. Meme stocks is gambling, not investing. Only gamble when you’re willing to lose 100%.  And don’t complain when you do."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Society is literally built around market growth. Pensions, 401Ks, jobs, and most importantly: the wealth of those who donate to politicians. The market will be fine. This isn't some structural market failure like 2008, and any bubble we may be in isn't as big as the dot-com bubble and there are rational explanations for most of this market growth."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Your ability to be aware of that and admit it, is part of the learning process, and knowing when you don't know something is a strength in and of itself. Keep up the hard work and give me a follow. 

I have a discord and im working on bringing up a website specifically designed to help retailers. There will be free content and any future costs of service will be low so that I can be inclusive for even the traders with only a few $100. 

Hope to see you there, if you want a link to the Discord, feel free to DM. Its been very boring and ive been telling everyone to do nothing and sit on their hands during this correction. I'll pick back up in activity when the market is safe. Feel free to stop in and say hello. Currently everything is free and I will always have free content available."
03/25/2021,stocks,Everybody starts there. :-)
03/25/2021,stocks,That's like trying to argue over what an uptrend is when one person is looking at a 15 min chart and the other is looking at the 4 hour. There are different scales that cycles happen on. Thinking macro is micro and vice versa or trying to be argumentative over the quantifiable semantics of those cycles is a moot point. Im not even sure that you made a real point tbh. Go be a cranky wanker somewhere else. Some people just lost everything. Can the market go down a lot further? Yeah. Are you dumb for pointing that out? Sort of.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I was going to get certified. So studied the test material for the series 65/66/7 tests, which mostly teach you the inner workings of the market, but there's nowhere that teaches you the dirty tricks. No one can talk about that. 

But when you learn how the markets work, you realize there are loopholes that are easily exploited, especially by larger players. After that, its mostly putting together whats happening through qualitative evidence. 

You can never really prove what they're doing. It helps to understand what's going on so that you can properly position yourself to capitalize on it. And the only real evidence you get is watching your bottom line, as in, if you're wrong about your assertions it will cost you and vice versa."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, me calling all the pullbacks and crashes over 4 years across 2 markets is luck. The fact that you think ""shorters"" crashed the market shows that you probably started in April after it happened. Will you teach me how to be good sir? 

Also, good to point out that, if everyone called the crash, why did so many get stuck in it? 

There's always some airhead who comes out and feels the need to diminish the success of others. You are that airhead. Whether you realize it or not. Crawl back under your rock."
03/25/2021,stocks,I think that and any dissenting opinion is dismissed as hedgie bot spam.  It definitely has cultish leanings at this point.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Huh? ""Proud"" of me, for what? Because I understand what's going on here, and have used the opportunity to learn way more about market mechanics than I ever did in university textbooks? I reiterate: **ignorance is bliss.**"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I guess I’ll delete that comment. Point still stands, lower income people aren’t investing like the wealthy."
03/25/2021,stocks,And unemployment and free child money are also forms of stimulus checks.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I guess what I'm saying is that while I agree with you that it is a small contingency, the fact remains that it is the largest group of people receiving an influx of cash outside of April 2020.  Both of our points are based in logic, so I guess we'll just have to see which truth is more truthy!"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I guess you missed where I said overall it was a good thing? The checks just didn’t make a lot of sense, in my opinion. I’m glad they expanded the unemployment benefits since anyone who is still out of work from this pandemic obviously needs the money."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Your reading comprehension is terrible. The lip fillers were an anecdote, just to provide a case that I experienced. Also, the 50%s are not exclusive. I’m sure there are people living nice lives in the Midwest that either put the stimulus into savings or the market."
03/25/2021,stocks,you better hope so GME's past performance is shit
03/25/2021,stocks,Is that really a thing?
03/25/2021,stocks,"So you're intimately familiar with Erdogan as a leader, yet you somehow think Trump is liked by other countries? I'm so confused."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Sure thing, boss"
03/25/2021,stocks,"After my shorts were shot, I put everything for calls into the summer. Come on June and July!"
03/25/2021,stocks,May is usually a red month if I’m not mistaken.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Fr lmao i've been losing capital this whole time, they need to cheer up :-)"
03/25/2021,stocks,he's not down as bad as if you were invested in individual companies. Less risk = less reward but less losses when corrections come. That is all.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yea... lesson learned. I just recently started investing and went with a lot of reddit hype.
03/25/2021,stocks,"That’s me. 25% VOO and various percentages in other areas like bonds, internationals, REITs, dividends, blue chips, and 10% in guesses on sectors (like cannabis, which is complete shit right now but long run should be good) and individuals (like Funko)."
03/25/2021,stocks,Didnt NOK just announce a pretty big layoff supposedly for share holders? Personally I dont like that. If theyll shaft their employees theyll shaft their investors.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hey that's good stuff. Thanks man. I will do that. 


>Its been very boring and ive been telling everyone to do nothing and sit on their hands during this correction. I'll pick back up activity when the market is safe

On that comment alone I'll follow you. 


You could try and amass followers and be a pumper with small penny stocks. But it does not appear that is the case. A pumper wouldn't tell people to hold because the market is insane. 



A good coach would do that though."
03/25/2021,stocks,">Go be a cranky wanker somewhere else. Some people just lost everything.

lol, ok buddy. Don't know what you're so pissed off about that makes you so angry but hope you can figure it out, and stop projecting, ""cranky wanker"" lmfao. 


And are you dumb for pointing out there are different time cycles but fundamentally misunderstanding the definition of a ""market correction"" and instead crying about semantics? And for having no fucking clue what capitulation means in the market?  Sort of."
03/25/2021,stocks,Thank you
03/25/2021,stocks,Actually I started back in January when I learned about covid breaking out and china and did my DD. You are an imbecile with an ego. Blocked.
03/25/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/25/2021,stocks,Lol ok 👍🏻
03/25/2021,stocks,"But most of that money isn't being put directly into the stock market, that many believed would happen.  Thats the whole point of this discussion.  Yes the money will boost the economy but we know that doesn't mean the market instantly goes up.

This sub skews very upper middle class and thinks the average person has way more disposable income then they actually do."
03/25/2021,stocks,">The checks just didn’t make a lot of sense, in my opinion. 

Why?  What changed from 4 or 12 months ago that makes people in a better situation then the first two times?  Or do you think less than $2000 is enough for a year?

I'd also love to hear how you think this could have been a bipartisan bill."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Lol that makes zero sense and still doesn't solve your logical inconsistency from your previous post.  Obviously botex is a place holder for something superficial or unnecessary.   Jesus.  My reading comprehension is far from the problem here.

I literally asked how many people you think fall into that category and you said over 50%."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yup check out the DD in r/gme
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, seems odd but during his time, middle eastern countries find a chance to advance in their will against the US’ “Greater Middle East” project which affects us, Turkey, directly. Also during that time we had the chance to intervene in Syrian civil war and created some buffer zones to sweep all hassle from our border. There were the times many bombs dropped to Turkish side and even cities. Well.. the thing I don’t understand why all the western world yelled and screamed when Turkey took part in the war while all the shit happens on our border, yet overseas countries already involved.
Also, Trump started the talks between israel and arabs."
03/25/2021,stocks,Sure but it's not like we're in usual market conditions
03/25/2021,stocks,"Im hearing that on every month ""but this month is supposed to be red"""
03/25/2021,stocks,Boomers used to say sell in May and go away I believe....
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ahh EFT's are a good place to start. Small investments in ETFs. But then again, gotta know when to get in. In this market though the get in is now haha"
03/25/2021,stocks,I call those guys promoters like Tim Sykes. He is another good trader. Much better than me. I actually watch market caps and volume and am specifically wary of growing too big for that reason alone. You will see that I recommend limit orders if I make a call for a small cap with a thin order book. I am highly against pumpers. Just like to help those that I can.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Good job, you saw what happened in China and realized that America wasn't paying attention and was being stupid. If you really did that, then you might have a knack for trading. However, don't think that was as obvious to others as it may have been to you. Also, go ahead and block, but that type of sensitivity and reactivity are characteristics you want to get rid of. Doing so will improve your trading. Don't let words you don't like have such an emotional effect on you."
03/25/2021,stocks,"RemindMe! 3 months ""A guy butthurt about the market correction he refused to prepare for"".

Followed 😉"
03/25/2021,stocks,They are checks of unexpected money that are meant to stimulate the economy
03/25/2021,stocks,Duude I'm not saying that I can't comprehend that only like 2% of the total population is in this situation.  What I'm saying is that 2% is like 20x more than the usual pool of 0.001% of people that normally have disposable income at any given moment.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m not trying to debate politics in an investment sub (I admittedly should have left the bipartisan comment out). I was just replying to the Canadian commenter how I think the stimulus checks were a bit...unnecessary for most people. Unemployment is down, consumer spending is up, anyone invested in the stock market over the past year has done quite well. I would have loved to see more money put toward unemployment benefits for those who have been forced out of work, and help for truly low income households."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, my estimate would still be 50%. Nothing that I've said is inconsistent with that statement. Also, the botex isn't a placeholder, I was literally sharing an actual anecdote. It may have been the most ""superficial or unnecessary"" anecdote I have but it is something that actually happened. What percent do you estimate fall into the category?"
03/25/2021,stocks,I dont buy it.
03/25/2021,stocks,Fair point.
03/25/2021,stocks,Unfortunately boomers still own a lot of the stock market. They never seem to retire from trading.
03/25/2021,stocks,“Unexpected” lol
03/25/2021,stocks,And what the rest of us (and I think the OP) are saying is that amount isn't nearly enough to actually raise the market that some people (apparently) thought would happen.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Consumer spending is still below 2019 and wont exceed that until 2022.  I think the vast majority of people that received a check needed it and are using so responsibly.  

>anyone invested in the stock market over the past year has done quite well

Yeah but that is A)irrelevant and B) not most people who are getting a check.  This sub greatly skews upper middle class and I think its certainly showing.

>I would have loved to see more money put toward unemployment benefits for those who have been forced out of work, and help for truly low income households.

Of sure, I agree, but I think we both know why that isn't happening."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The amount of people making less than 50K far exceeds the amount of people making between 50 and 75K so way less than 50%.

I mean you said you never heard of a salary reduction taking place over the past year due to Covid, so not really sure more needs to be said.  You have a good day."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Believe what you want but the r/gme DD has predicted and explains the entire market behavior for a while now and the ppl who were/are nonbelievers are now asking, wHy MaRkEt ReD?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"The market could/should explode this summer. If the vaccines get rolled out and movies get released, travel starts happening, more theme park visits , more people at sporting events. 

Sadly I do not think concerts will be a huge part of this as they are capping attendance to 30-35 percent and charging bands double the normal rate to play and the bands insurance costs are also going up because of covid."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, I'm not sure if you knew this but that bill was passed last month, so it is a new change.

What exactly is it that you are disagreeing with me about?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Agree to disagree with that.  When I hear that hundreds of millions of poor and middle class people are receiving thousands of dollars in direct aid from the federal government, that trillions of other dollars are being spent on propping the economy up, and that interest rates are expected to remain at-or-near historic lows, I am inclined to believe that stock prices will rise.

Add in the recent inflationary fears which only make stocks a more attractive option (I never understood why people's fears of inflation were running around in these threads, inflation is great for the stock market -- no one wants to be tied up in low-interest bonds during inflation, they'd much rather tie it up in the stock market so that their money keeps pace).

Needless to say, if the stock market were to permanently close today - I'd be wrong and you'd be right -- clearly there are other factors at play right now that are more than off-setting whatever positives I just outlined above; however, I don't think the market is going to close for good this afternoon and I do believe that ultimately I will be vindicated.  For now, it's anyone's guess, so that's why they play the game."
03/25/2021,stocks,"To clarify, I don’t think nobody should be getting stimulus checks. I just don’t think upper middle class (not sure where that cutoff is to be honest) should be getting them. But maybe the difference between only people making less than median income getting them and the additional people who did is small enough that it doesn’t matter."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I hope you have a good day as well. Not to continue our disagreement, because I see that we won't reach an understanding of the others ""logic"" (Put in quotes because I haven't really delved into any of the data, as you may have). But, the statements were not mutually exclusive, I don't believe that just because you make less than 50k that the $1400 isn't superfluous. If you look at the midwest, $40k is actually not a bad income. You can look at the salary/avg house price to see that. After giving salary reduction data a cursory glance, my position would still stand. An estimated \~30% of people had some sort of salary reduction with an average of 10% reduction. I absolutely cannot believe that any of the unemployment data or salary reduction information point to more than 50% of the population needing $1400 to pay for necessities."

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-march-25.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures turn lower after Fed chief Powell comments

> * U.S. stock futures turned lower Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told NPR’s “Morning Edition” that Covid economic stimulus and vaccinations allowed the U.S. economy to recover faster than expected and that central bankers, at some point, may be able to pull back emergency support.

> * Late-day selling reversed gains and dragged the S&P 500 down 0.6% on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped lower in the final seconds of Wednesday’s session. The Nasdaq dropped 2% after a slightly higher open gave way to a day of selling. Tech stocks were lower despite the 10-year Treasury yield holding below recent a 14-month high as a market rotation out of high-flying growth names continued. The Nasdaq last closed at a record last month. The Dow and S&P 500 last closed at record highs last week.

> * The Labor Department is set to report its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the stock market opens. Economists expect 735,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down 35,000 from the prior week, which saw an unexpected jump even as many states relaxed Covid mitigation restrictions on businesses.

*****

> # 2. AstraZeneca revises Covid vaccine data with lower efficacy rate

> * AstraZeneca late Wednesday issued updated Covid vaccine numbers from its late-stage trial in the U.S. and Latin America after U.S. health officials earlier this week questioned the accuracy of preliminary data. The U.K.-based drug giant now said its vaccine is 76% effective in protecting against symptomatic cases of virus. A release issued on Monday reported an efficacy rate of 79%. AstraZeneca reiterated its two-shot regimen was “well tolerated” among participants and no safety concerns were identified.

*****

> # 3. Biden to hold first news conference of presidency

> * The White House announced Thursday that it’s dedicating another $10 billion to try to drive up vaccination rates in low-income, minority and rural communities. More than 25% of the entire U.S. population received at least one vaccine dose, including 14% who have been fully vaccinated. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require two shots, while Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is only one shot.

> * Against the backdrop of rising Covid cases in many states and more than 30 million total U.S. infections, President Joe Biden is set to hold his first news conference. He’s expected to point to a surge in vaccinations, encouraging signs in the economy and the benefits Americans will receive from the latest sweeping stimulus package. He’s also likely to face a wide range of questions from U.S.-Mexico border security to gun control in the wake of mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia.

*****

> # 4. Oil prices slide as Covid concerns outweigh Suez Canal disruptions

> * Oil prices fell Thursday as fuel demand concerns re-emerged alongside worries about steps back in the global fight against Covid. Prices of U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude and the Brent international benchmark each dropped roughly 2%, one day after they both surged nearly 6% on the crude shipping disruptions caused by the grounding of a giant container ship in the Suez Canal, a major trade route. It could “take weeks” to clear, according to the CEO of a Dutch company helping with the salvage efforts.

*****

> # 5. Lawmakers to press tech CEOs over speech, misinformation

> * Big Tech leaders Thursday are scheduled to testify at a virtual House panel hearing on efforts to prevent their platforms from spreading falsehoods and inciting violence. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, whose company owns Google and YouTube, will face increased pressure following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and the rise in Covid vaccine misinformation. There’s increasing support in Congress for imposing new curbs on legal protections regarding speech posted online.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, March 25th, 2021! :)**"
03/25/2021,stocks,Fuuuuuccckkkk. Make it stop.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Help!

A bear ate my lunch!"
03/25/2021,stocks,Oh for fucks sake. I have high conviction plays so I’ll come back in a few months. Until then I’ll work on graduating.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Bought apple and Starbucks yesterday. If this really falls another 5%, I’m unloading into more options"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Welp, another red day."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Many buying opportunities could materialize between today and tomorrow.  
I'm looking at:

\- PYPL under 220  
\- PLTR under 20  
\- BABA under 210  
\- TM under 145"
03/25/2021,stocks,Right move. If you beleive in your companies then this sell-off shouldn't scare you.
2021-03-25 16:37:45,stocks,"Coinbase IPO  

I think everyone at this point knows that Coinbase will be going public and there is a lot of interest in getting in on the action before they actually go public.

There is actually a german based crypto exchange FTX that allows you to create a smart contract which will be tied to fractional equivalents of the Coinbase stock once it goes live. So that is how people are already buying / trading the Coinbase stock. 

As of today these contracts are going for about $404 giving Coinbase a valuation of around $70B. o.O

I know this is confusing for a lot of people not familiar with the crypto world and if you live in America you are technically not even allowed to buy in on these contracts.

So here is another way to get in on the Coinbase stocks early

Cathie Wood the founder and CEO of ARK investments is known to be a bull on Crypto and especiallly Bitcoin.

One of the funds that ARK controls is their ARKF or ARK Fintech.

I think it is a very fair assumption that once Coinbase IPO's that this fund will be picking up a large cache of Coinbase stock.

So if you want to get in on Coinbase early I suggest you load up on ARKF it is a safe bet to get in early on Coinbase without having to mess around with smart contracts. Get in while the price is right!"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Wow, do not load up on ARKF just because you think it might allocate a few % to a future crypto related IPO. If you want crypto just buy Bitcoin. Is there any reason to buy coinbase stock instead of just Bitcoin?"
03/25/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/25/2021,stocks,"Mostly I trade crypto in America.  The in America part is one of the reasons I am not interested in coinbase stock.  Because it is so over regulated, great cryptos are not listed on coinbase until much much later, if at all.  American investors in crypto often have to jump through hoops to be able to get cryptos that are not listed yet on American exchanges.    I've been annoyed particularly at coinbase for not listing Theta token before it was 1 USD , therefore taking the opportunity away from investors in America to benefit from a tech based in America. While people across the globe had access, over regulation shut it's own country out."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Been eyeing this for a while, good idea to get ARKF as an in before this IPO goes live."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, there is. Coinbase and similar exchanges make profit of volatility when people are buying and selling crypto. It has some correlation with the actual cryptocoin price - but they earn money by charging fees and stuff regardless of the way crypto trends (up/down).

Same stuff with stock brokers. They are salespeople - their money making tactics is to increase the client base to profit off the increased trading action."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Coinbase and bitcoin are somewhat different investments. I cannot say I am an expert on coin bases business model, but I expect they gain more of their revenue through people trading crypto currencies than through the price of cryptocurrencies increasing. So an investment in coinbase would be an investment in overall cryto interest and trade volume increasing, which could occur without the value of crypto currencies themselves increasing. In my opinion it acts as a more diversified bet on general cryptocurrency adoption and is less reliant on the price of any crypto asset like bitcoin or even the value of the crypto market as a whole. At a certain level of crypto adoption however coinbase and other entirely crypto based exchanges become unnecessary because there will be much less need to transfer money back and forth between crypto and fiat currencies. So a bet on coinbase requires a balance where more people are buying and selling crypto, but are not able to use it as an everyday currency. The best possible case I can think of for coinbase is a situation like we have now, where cryptos are used as speculative investments and stores of value instead of actual currencies for transactions."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Anecdotal, but Voyager stock has been performing incredibly well while the VGX token is slowing down. Sometimes the stocks don't necessarily move in sync with the crypto."
03/25/2021,stocks,Its basically on a promise that they will be converted to fractional shares after the first day of trading. Here is a link that explains [https://ftx.com/equities\_terms/KID\_CBSE.pdf](https://ftx.com/equities_terms/KID_CBSE.pdf)
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm not familiar with VGX, but Bitcoin is not coinbase's coin, and coinbase can't mint tokens or have some percentage of the supply reserved to sell off. I wouldn't buy the coinbase stock after IPO, and cash out many different layers of early investors, banks, etc. instead of just buying Bitcoin which is going to highly correlate with the stock anyway, if bitcoin fails so does coinbase, but in the end bitcoin will be much more valuable."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yes I understand that. I was trying to give an example of where a coin and company with an even closer relationship have non-correlated price movements. I could see coinbase continue to grow even as Bitcoin price falls. They allow investors to buy and sell more cryptos than just Bitcoin you know.
2021-03-25 16:13:42,stocks,"Buying the dip, no money left I’m sure many of us are in a position where we are 5,10,20,30% down on some of our positions but we want to buy the dip. You know if you buy the dip, you’ll have no free cash for another month. 

I’ve got my eyes on Tesla which I don’t own any of, although there are many other stocks I want to get in on. Are you holding out until this volatility passes? It seems very possible we could plunge deeper, or equally as likely to shoot back up 20% in a day. 

I’m in the edge of deciding whether to hoard cash for a few months or keep buying in until I’m broke. Indices like the NASDAQ are making moves above 1% daily yet the VIX somehow is going down. What are your plays? Any really cheap stocks that have been beaten down more than they deserve? 

I currently own AAPL, PLTR, NIO, XPENG, VACQ, ARKF, ARKG and am down significantly. Sure the recovery stocks may have a 10% upside at the moment but long term, they are stagnant and can’t expect much growth from them if they don’t drastically change their business plans."
03/25/2021,stocks,"If these are stocks for the long term, I suggest you just invest monthly regardless. The dip that's been dipping can keep on dipping or it could go back up no one knows what will happen on the short term. 

What I do know is time in the market beats timing the market so I'm going to invest part of my paycheck and the dividends for March into the market when I receive them."

03/25/2021,stocks,Every time I see these posts I think it's early 2020. Then I check indices and just see normal periods of consolidation. IDK what people expect from the market other than a constant green vertical line.
03/25/2021,stocks,So good news and vaccine = stock market goes down. Bad news and no vaccine market goes up. Got it.
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you think the price of a stock will return to what it was a week ago, then it doesn't really matter if you buy when it is 10% down or 90% down. Sure your profits would be maximal if you bought at the lowest part of the dip but unless you come into a crystal ball you have no way of determining when that could be. Invest what you can if you want to, but don't invest yourself out of liquid cash that you actually need to live on. Stash that money in a savings account if you're actually going to need it in the next few weeks/months."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I spent quite a bit on 'yesterday's dips', including Tesla. I'm already down. I think I'll give it a few days to see how this plays out before spending anymore."
03/25/2021,stocks,Il just be chucking as much as I can in every week
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm also very confused as to when the bottom will be... especially for stocks that have already fallen 45% +
03/25/2021,stocks,I would noy buy another share of what you have in your portfolio. Only thinig I would keep is apple. You need to look and understand the investment triangle. Until you have a good base you are going to bleed money trying to gamble on speculative stocks. Buy something that can survive a downturn for 3 years and pays a good dividend. That way at least you are making money even when you are down.
03/25/2021,stocks,To me it sounds like you're trying to choose between 2 extremes. All in and all out.... Maybe look into DCA or dip buying strategies. Both require you to keep some cash on hand to be able to follow the strategy... Hope that helps. Not financial advice
03/25/2021,stocks,I stopped adding money to (my high growth/risk) stocks. My hedge is just holding cash for a bit. I also am focusing on paying off other debt and that is a guaranteed return!
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm almost out of cash too, but going to average into PLTR, AAPL, ADBE."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Are you long primarily?  Do still like the potential of the stocks you purchased?  If yes, just sit tight and avg down if you can.

If the volatility if this stocks bothers you, consider investing in a total market or index etf as well to balance out your portfolio."
03/25/2021,stocks,That's why you don't spend all your dip money at once. Buy a little bit every day.
03/25/2021,stocks,"What are you trying to accomplish?

If you’re investing for long-term buy and hold, dollar cost averaging into diversified holdings is the right way to go. This current dip is barely registering on diversified portfolios.

If you’re trying to pick stocks and time the market, this is a prime example of why that’s hard to do. Meme stocks are out of control, with TSLA’s valuation so far disconnected from reality that analysts are making up future cash flows from things like a hypothetical insurance arm and other weirdness that hasn’t even been started. The meme-ness could continue, or it could fall out of favor and crash back to reality.

Remember, you can’t tell the difference between “buying the dip” and “trying to catch a falling knife” until you exit. What’s your exit strategy with each of these investments?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yesterday, I cut losses in several positions I was holding and losing faith in their ability to rebound then immediately took the funds and bought the dip in a few positions I feel stronger about.

Some of that dip was extremely tasty and thru this point in today, some of the positions I averaged down on have made enough of a rebound to recover the last two days of losses"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Be careful about this strategy of ""buying the dip"". I nearly got burned on it last March. What can happen is you buy arbitrary amounts with each drop, until eventually you have no cash left to invest, and the market keeps dropping, and suddenly you're wondering if you're going to go broke. It's impossible to know the bottom, so it's impossible to say ""I'll invest X amount each drop until the bottom"" without knowing if you'll run out of cash.

If you want to buy dips, you need to come up with a plan in advance and stick with it. For example, maybe have a target cash/stock value ratio. So if you have $200,000 in stocks and $40,000 cash, have a 80% stock 20% cash ratio target. So when your stocks drop, you invest some but not all cash, but you always have cash available to invest."
03/25/2021,stocks,I hope with the drip  that we see some appl about $110.00 I would load up with a couple thousand shares at that point
03/25/2021,stocks,"Don’t buy now, only fools rush in.  The market’s been up for the past 12 months, it’s normal if it goes down for 2 months or so."
03/25/2021,stocks,This is nowhere near the Bottom for most of these Stocks especially Tesla and ARKK.
03/25/2021,stocks,"AAPL is my largest position, then PLTR, NIO, BB, ARKK, ARKF. added to PLTR yesterday, plus I sold some $23 puts that expire tomorrow. Not quite out of cash yet. Will add more NIO... and maybe AAPL. I have no doubt they will all pay off. But until then it is painfully frustrating."
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you’re having to decide between investing and going broke for months, I think you have an easy answer. 
Also, you might want to stop buying individual stocks, especially ones based almost entirely on hype. Buy mutual funds and invest long term on an automatic schedule the boring way or buy ETFs if you like the thrill of pressing the Buy button."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Times like these, I average down a couple hardest-hit long term stocks per day.  It helps a lot in the long term.    If I'm holding something I only wanted to hold for a few days/weeks, I sell it off  (for a gain or a small loss -- doesn't matter) and use those proceeds towards my long term holds.   If I wait for my short term holdings to start making profit again, I miss out on averaging down my long-term holds, which are priority."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Just keep dollar cost averaging the dip.

If you ""run out of money"" you're probably doing something wrong... assuming you have an income."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I have a 401k and index fund for long term growth. I want to have some fun in the market. Sir, this is a casino! I know. The house always wins in the long run. Bastards."
03/25/2021,stocks,"In my honesty this is what I am doing, preserving my gains by having a loss limit of - 7% per stock. I've sold mostly everything now and I'm glad because ALL the ones I sold have fallen even deeper. So I preserved most of my cash. I will buy back in once the usual volume for Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Ftse 100 is back to normal levels for longer than a few days. If you keep buying the Dip, it could go on for much longer and then you got no money. Fuck holding bags on stocks you don't even know if they would recover to normal levels again. Plus the stress I had constantly watching the screen got on my tits, now I'm out I feel free to sit and watch"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Do NOT throw more money away in this over-valued market, esp Tesla. I’m loading up on $SQQQ - Short the Nasdaq and enjoy watching the slow burn as retail investors cut their losses to cover their neglected bills."
03/25/2021,stocks,I think you can call the drop the Biden affect. Until anybody knows what the taxation policy will be we will continue to see some downward movement as people are taking profits. You can’t blame them for doing that.
03/25/2021,stocks,"FWIW VIX is a pretty limited view of the volatility surface of the SPX. Either on twitter or maybe in an interview, I can't remember where I read it, @jam_croissant said the # itself is not useful, but when VIX breaks from its usual inverse correlation that you should pay attention (ie: SPX up = VIX down normally. If SPX up and VIX up pay attention)

Edit: And I'm of the opinion that we're in for a wild and rocky road for the next few months. A year of crazy returns can now be cashed out for long term gains, bonds and commodities doing stuff, sector rotation, reopening plays, and early data suggests the latest stimulus check isn't going into the market (at least not yet). Retail call buying has been helping propel the market, especially many of the names you mentioned, if that flow subsides it's gonna be interesting to see what happens."
03/25/2021,stocks,Time for me to buy more
03/25/2021,stocks,I have been buying the fuck out of vacq today
03/25/2021,stocks,"I just loaded hard by buying the dip, TSLA, AAPL, SP500, NIO, TDOC, XPENG. Next month I am not sure it's going to be still down by 20%. I believe recovery is coming back."
03/25/2021,stocks,Man I spent all I have on a last dip. Now we are on a double dip :(
03/25/2021,stocks,"I've been tapped out for a couple of weeks, but thankfully, I'm in companies that I like long term. I would have liked to pick more up, but I'm not about to complain too much about it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Buy the dip, the problem is, it keep dipping and I ain't no got no money's left.

03/25/2021,stocks,Tesla is overvalued rn. I'd wait to get in
03/25/2021,stocks,"I bought 10 apple stock at 98€. Have around 500€ left so running out of money is a problem.

03/25/2021,stocks,"VIX is designed to go down if the market is going up OR if it is flat. The Nasdaq's moves have not been extreme at all. Down 1%, then flat or maybe up a little next day. It's basically sideways, which means VIX will go down."
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you are not covering your necessities, don’t buy more stocks. I’ve been there, not worth it. Plan on investing a fixed amount periodically in stocks that you believe in and forget about them. Life will be way better and you can really enjoy it."

03/25/2021,stocks,i’m way down even after a month of dip buying. i’m only adding into funds on my retirement accounts for the rest of the year
03/25/2021,stocks,"You took the risk, like a lot of us, to buy and hold volatile stocks. If you think AAPL is a ""safe"" stock you are a very aggressive investor and as such should be able to stomach -30%, -50%, etc. Every reward has risk."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Am not worryed about vacq, in a year it will be way up"
03/25/2021,stocks,Do you have a margin account?
03/25/2021,stocks,"I have my biggest holdings in TSLA, PLTR and ARKG. Diamond hands for the next 20 years. Not worried at all about this correction.Trying to put as much money as I can right now into the market"
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s been mathematically proven that this is actually most effective and safest way to invest your money: averaging into or out of a position over time
03/25/2021,stocks,"Buy anyway is right.  I started to buy LMT on Feb 1, but decided to wait for it to drop more.  It's now up to about $360 from about $320 then.  I screwed up."
03/25/2021,stocks,Dis is de way
03/25/2021,stocks,seconded. don’t take a huge liability to buy a piece of paper that may or may not be worth something in the next year month or even week.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Actually using leverage is a widely accepted practice amongst professional investors. It should be used carefully, but don’t rule it out."
03/25/2021,stocks,Can you tell me more about this please? Why not take Margin debt?
03/25/2021,stocks,Famous last words to all major financial institutions in 2008.
03/25/2021,stocks,Why? You people want to call it a dip implying the situation is temporary. Get a massive loan since stocks literally only go up.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Lol good news? Half of Europe is back into confinement, AstraZeneca vaccines are being hoarded or vaccinations stopped because of fears of health hazards, variants that are even more contagious than the original covid strains are starting to roam around, and a ship the size of a skyscraper is blocking the Suez Canal. Plus, people are still dying, a third wave is coming, and Trump is no longer around to artificially pump the stock market like in 2020."
03/25/2021,stocks,"No not really... The stock market went up because of all the freshly printed money, stimulus money and the recovery from covid got priced in. So basically the market was on highs on the premises that covid would go away soon, the governments/central banks would keep on supporting the economy and there was A LOT of extra money. 

Now there is a vaccine but the recovery is soo much slower than expected and it seems to be harder to control covid (and the people) than expected. There are fears the governments can't keep supporting (inflation) and people are fully invested so there is no extra money. 
The market goes down because the good news isn't good enough. Not as good as expected. 

Disclaimer: this is my opinion, not advice. Also not supported by scientific research. Don't take this as an advice. Do your own research and make your own decisions"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Uncertainty is what makes markets go down, not good or bad news. The market tanked in March because nobody knew what would happen with covid, not because covid itself was bad. If we got news last April that covid was going to permanently lockdown society the stock market would recover because the big players would buy up toilet paper futures and stuff like that.

Now the markets are uncertain as to whether Powell will successfully manage a recovery without causing inflation or interest rates to spike. Once institutions feel confident they know which one of those things will happen (or if Powell walks the knife edge and nothing bad happens), they'll plan accordingly and make money."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes , signs of actual economic recovery means less QE and financial markets are jacked to the tits on them steroids ."
03/25/2021,stocks,Would you have many stocks up over 100% in less than a year you can expect more than a 50% decline in some of these positions
03/25/2021,stocks,Zoom out on the chart and look at their price 2-3 years ago for the answer
03/25/2021,stocks,"That's why DCA is at least psychologically the best technique. It's easier to ease in to the market, not taking all gains or all losses.

Of course lump sum is on average better, because on average the market is moving up. Assuming the market as a general direction is going up, DCA will lead to opportunity cost, because you will most likely buy part of your portfolio on a higher market than if you lump sum the money into the market.

However if you lump sum, it carries the risk that you might be buying on the exact peak. If you don't expect a lot more money to invest in the future this risk may be unattractive."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm 81% cash, 19% invested. Nothing on the market looks safe"
03/25/2021,stocks,💍🧊💦
03/25/2021,stocks,Whats the drip?
03/25/2021,stocks,I would buy in $AAPL at around 75$
03/25/2021,stocks,"a stock like PLTR that has dropped nearly 50%, if now is not a good time to buy when is it a good time to buy?

&#x200B;

After it's dropped 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%?"
03/25/2021,stocks,So right after tax season. Got it
03/25/2021,stocks,"Lotta meme stocks there, AAPL is the only one that holds weight"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not necessarily. In the long term, those who hold quality companies win. And the market will try to shake you loose from those. Have conviction, and watch out."
03/25/2021,stocks,Good luck trying to time the bottom
03/25/2021,stocks,I feel you! I had -5% trailing stop limits on all my stocks and they fell 10-30% so far!
03/25/2021,stocks,Yes. But many of the stocks and ETFs OP mentions are in full fledged bear territory. VIX doesn't capture the magnitude of that move in those stocks.
03/25/2021,stocks,Wut
03/25/2021,stocks,And then when interest rates rise it’ll come right back down.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I thought that it was disproved and actually investing a lump sum yields on average better results.

I'd like to stress ""on average"" because people who buy the top will be worse off. But if you take 365 people investing all their lump sum on different days, more than half will be better off than if they had DCA (my interpretation). And on the long run you'd be better off anyway with a lump sum investing.

But then again, it probably depends which sources you quote.

Source: JP Morgan ""Does DCA provide better results than a lump sum strategy"""
03/25/2021,stocks,"Do you have a source for that? (Am mathematician, just genuinely curious to read more)"
03/25/2021,stocks,Vanguard found the opposite - lump sum beats dollar cost averaging most of the time.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Lump sum investing beats DCA, so not most effective.  But that's assuming you have all the money at the start, of course.  If you're putting money into the market as you earn it, DCA is just a beneficial side effect."
03/25/2021,stocks,"it might be the safest, but it's definitely not the most effective 

not knocking it, I DCA, but lump sum has been proven time and time again to outperform 

high risk = high reward

DCA is not high risk"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Id bet 1 of my paychecks that spy will be worth something, greater than it is now, in a couple years"
03/25/2021,stocks,Operative word being professional.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yea, but that isn't their (the individual making that decision) money. Plus, they subsidise that risk.

They know that if they fail, they can make that up with deep pockets, bankruptcy, bailouts, or just change jobs. Not wreck their entire life and live in a van down by the river."
03/25/2021,stocks,I agree.  I turned on margin today.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Using 1% of your total portfolio as margin, no big deal. What OP is talking about is the people who do 10-20%+ of their total portfolio value on margin. That high of a % increases your chances of getting a margin call significantly (broker systematic sales of your holdings or you getting forced to choose)."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Because if the dip keeps on dipping, then you could get a margin call. If you have no cash to cover the margin call you could be in trouble."
03/25/2021,stocks,That was  priced in last month. We are onto something else.
03/25/2021,stocks,Recovery is slower is a current event and doest not reflect on the market now. So the state we are at right now is priced in the future already. What exactly is priced in right now? Housing market crash? Someone predicting a new strain? We going to war?
03/25/2021,stocks,The market was sky rocketing for the past year until February. You can't say for the past year we were close of ending covid and for some reason now we are not. We're closer then ever to finally being done with a world wide pandemic and NOW the stocks want to plummet? Okay. Yeah. Makes perfect sense
03/25/2021,stocks,The recovery is in the minds of the 1%
03/25/2021,stocks,"AFAIK, you don't have to disclaim, as you are not trading this advice for any kind of gain. You have not gained anything sharing this, thus it is not advice, it's an opinion. But I get why you do it anyway 👍"

03/25/2021,stocks,What's up with you guys obsessing over PLTR?
03/25/2021,stocks,"It depends much more on how far up it's risen, since it shows how much more it's currently overvalued. For instance some stocks have gone up 900% in a year. For those I normally think back a year ago, if I purchased the stock, what I think my price target would be, many have exponentially achieved it, but normally 30% is a solid time to start gradually buying."

03/25/2021,stocks,Don’t forget that it IPOd at like $9 last year actually was around $7-8 for a while.
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s still up 140% in the last 7 months.

03/25/2021,stocks,I've tried that 3 times already I'd rather buy on the upward trend now but not this week. Have you timed the bottom correctly? Are you down more than 7% overall? Just couldn't stand to see all my gains turn to bags
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes but the VIX is the fear gauge for the whole market, not select stocks and ETFs. Defensive stocks have not been sold off."
03/25/2021,stocks,"In the long run, I think it depends on circumstances. If you have a lump sum, you are better to invest it all at once rather than dripping it in; but if you don’t have one, you’re better off dripping in what you can rather than saving for a lump sum to invest at a later date. 

I don’t know about entering / exiting over a short term though. Are you better to jump all in / out at once, or to do it in percentages in the hope that it will average out in your favour?"

Edit: I don't know if this his true for individual stock investment. Most people DCA because they have to"
03/25/2021,stocks,"It kinda depends on circumstances. There was a post somewhere that broke it all down and, in the end, it resulted in something like 30% less than *perfectly* timing the markets overall."
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s all relative to timing.  The person that went balls deep early February of last year did not do as well as the person that pushed all the chips in on March 23rd.  Just the facts of timing.
03/25/2021,stocks,"There's a really good vanguard study I'll try and track down that really opens your eyes to how each case is different. Their conclusion was actually that lump sum investing was the better strategy but that's because it outperformed \~64% of the time in their simulations, but when you pull back the layers of each simulation there are huge variances, with big winners, big losers, and everyone in between. Makes it feel even more like a crazy fucking casino."
03/25/2021,stocks,I bet 25% of my paycheck on this every two weeks. But that doesn’t mean I’d borrow money to do it
03/25/2021,stocks,But will the return in two years outweigh the interest payments on the loan compounded over the next two years? This is the question someone considering margin investing needs to ask.
03/25/2021,stocks,Would you bet a 100 shares?
03/25/2021,stocks,Ok but I think we can strive for a little better than Dave Ramsey level of financial advice here.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m talking about best practice from the CFA material which is considered optimal even when acting highly ethically. 

Good money managers will allow their client to choose a level of risk and return.

Leverage is just a tool, it can be used to increase your risk weighted return. On a risk  adjusted basis over a lifetime, it’s much safer and more optimal to leverage the SP500 over YOLO stock picks if you want an increased return."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Priced in simply means people's ability to guesstimate the future. 

Let's take TSLA as an example. The price of TSLA basically includes all of the expectations of what TSLA will do in the next 5 years. Then, when say china states they are going to have 50% EV by 2025. you'd think this is good news right? TSLA is EV. But actually it's likely that NIO would be a strong contender, so all of a sudden TSLA price may come down as its future is now ""pricing in"" the % chance that NIO takes business away from TSLA in the Chinese markets.

Remember, everyone here is trying to be ahead of the pack, while also not so far ahead you have to sit there waiting for everyone else to catch up. 

Priced in, means whatever edge or thought you had, was had by multiple other people before you, and is now already reflected in the price: because they bought and expect it to rise. Thus were willing to pay a premium on the price, causing the price to rise; thus pricing in."

Even with the vaccines lockdowns are still needed (look at germany, france etc.). I agree with you it seems to make zero sense but how it's going right now is less than expected. That's why it went down.

03/25/2021,stocks,Their CEO has the best haircut
03/25/2021,stocks,"People like PLTR because their CEO is incredibly smart, they have multiple excellent products, and aggressive (but not unrealistic) expansion plans for the long/very long term (5-20 years). 

There are many real concerns with this company (cost of revenue earned, scalability) and the stock might fall significantly in the future (next 2 years) because the valuation is still high at $20-$25/share. Anyone who thinks it’s an overnight play, or has short squeeze potential is misinformed. 

But people (myself included) believe strongly in the team, and products, and feel like we’re getting into something special at the ground floor. They also have little direct competition, and a large moat to entry (20 years of R&D, high CORE). I will be adding to my position regularly for the foreseeable future, at any price below $40, currently have about 2% of my portfolio in PLTR."

03/25/2021,stocks,"It's not a question of better/worse - it's a question of risk preferences. Putting it all in at once means being in the market longer, which implies a higher expected return. It also makes you more vulnerable to a sudden downturn (ie. more risk). Averaging in makes you less vulnerable to a sudden downturn (ie. less risk), but that means your money has less time in the market (ie. lower expected return). Investing is purely about risks and returns. The cost of higher expected returns is to accept higher risk."
03/25/2021,stocks,"My assumption is that cost averaging over time is still better than lump sum after the fact, but lump sum before you ever cost average is best.

I can see holding some cash for a true market crash, but most people, like me, can only invest so much per month. So it's not like there's a real choice between strategies there."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's funny though, how it's common knowledge that ""DCA is better than LSI"" but the full story was probably lost in time/translation. Most people DCA simply because they receive their paycheck monthly :)

03/25/2021,stocks,"Oh I understand all that in practice. It was just the OP suggested there was a mathematically proven optimal strategy, and proof means something pretty rigorous, so I was curious to read about it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Time in the Market > Timing the market. 

The person that pushed all their chips in in March 23rd had to also not have any chips in before the crash or had to know when to pull them out right before. They have to time the market right *twice*. If they were invested prior to the 2020 crash then they would have likely returned to where they were by late July depending on their portfolio. Time in the market is less stressful imo and has better odds of success for your average investor."
03/25/2021,stocks,This is the way
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah totally agree. I think that is the biggest aspect of it. Now usually margin is pretty cheap. One percent or half a percent or something?

03/25/2021,stocks,"Underrated comment, surprised I had to scroll this far down the thread to find this advice. 

DCA = less risk, so higher floor and lower ceiling

Lump sum= higher risk, lower floor, higher ceiling"
03/25/2021,stocks,This. If you have a lump sum and invest immediately instead of dripping in you have more money in the market for more time so that’s better. But then to save up week after week until you have a lump sum again to invest means more money spending more time out of the market. I am really curious about these studies. Links please
03/25/2021,stocks,"Look up the story of bob the most unlucky investor

03/25/2021,stocks,"The ‘no fear’ attitude, I like it."
03/25/2021,stocks,...I'm confused. That has been my point the whole time.
03/25/2021,stocks,"The point of the story is that absolutely nobody on the entirety of planet earth can time the stock market, and because of that nobody can pick the “best time” to lump sum. Yes, in hindsight you’re right, mathematically if everything was thrown in in 1973 he would have made the most. But nobody can tell you if lump summing everything in 2024 vs 2025 is better or worse, so ultimately its best to DCA, always. If Bob DCA’d instead of lump summing in at the absolute peaks before crashes he would have made exponentially more money than lump summing 3 times over 40 years. If you save up all your money only to try and dump it in at opportune times you will mathematically lose out more often than not as opposed to dumping a lump sum in and DCA-ing forever. The point of the story of bob is that its a bad idea to save up lump sums to dump in, instead you should just DCA whenever you have extra to set aside for investment purposes"
03/25/2021,stocks,"No, you're misinterpreting it if you think it somehow proves DCA is the best strategy

Bob lumpsummed in at the absolute worst times, and the point is *he still made considerable money*. DCA would have been better in his case, because of his terrible bad luck/attempts at timing. But this says nothing about DCA in general. Most people would have been luckier than Bob and benefitted from the extra time in the market"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think *you’re* misinterpreting what *I* am saying.

Read my last sentence again. The story is advocating against saving up lump sums of money. If you already have the money to spend YES put it in the market. But the idea the story promoted is to initially lump sum, and then DCA forever. DCA doesnt mean to only put part of your extra “investing” money in the market every month, it means to put money into the market as you earn it. If instead you put it in a savings account for a few months to years before investing it, congratulations you are now bob. There are multiple lessons the story promotes

The story does not argue that DCA is the best strategy to start out with, it argues that DCA is the best strategy to follow after an initial lump sum, *and* the idea that time in the market beats timing the market"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Right, in that case we're both saying stick the money in the market right away

Dollar cost average implies you have a lumpsum and wish to invest it spread over time. This is where we misunderstand each other, to me what you are describing is investing income as you earn it

If you want to invest income, best to just put in regularly. Bob's strategy of saving to lumpsum in was certainly terrible"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah it seems we were arguing the same approach, my understanding of DCA was to invest as you earn money not that you spread a lump sum over time, sorry for the confusion"
03/25/2021,stocks,"To be fair I have heard DCA used both ways, but in my mind it implies the money is already in your hand but you just don't want to put it all in at once. Which is a fair strategy, if you want to eliminate timing risk and are prepared to pay a bit for that on average"
2021-03-25 16:08:35,stocks,"$TSM - Fundamental Analysis - Still The King vs INTEL? **Hey there investors! In this post I am going to share with you my Due Diligence on the biggest semiconductor foundry in the world, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company!**

**\[Very Long Post\]**

# What’s the story of the company?

[TSM](https://imgur.com/0IJCk3R) is the biggest chip foundry to provide 7 & 5 nanometer chips that became very popular after Apple moved their chip design in-house. Apple isn’t the only company that works with TSM with other big names like AMD, NVIDIA, Broadcom, Qualcomm and even companies that also build their own chips like INTEL & NXP use TSM do increase their capacity.

Late last year the company also received approval to build a $12B chip plant in Phoenix, which will be a welcomed by the US, as chip demand has far outpaced the supply currently available around the world.

I know it might sound weird, but guys, in my opinion, I believe this $500B [company](https://imgur.com/gMPb0Pb) which has risen by more than 150% in the last year after the 2020 lows, still has some room to grow 

# Competition & Product 

I believe that TSM has a great advantage compared to companies that operate in their industry, as they have invested huge amounts of money in capital expenditures to gain competitive advantages compared to Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments, Broadcom & others.

We can also take a look at what Seeking Alpha Quant Factor [grades](https://imgur.com/KIQyCtO) the company, and we can see that TSM does pretty good in all 5 categories, Value, Growth, Profitability, Momentum & EPS Revisions.

One other thing we can see here, is that after the huge spike in price, the dividend yield of the company still has room to recover, as the 4-year average yields stands at over 3%, second only to Qualcomm

# MOAT – Easy to replicate? Branding value? Dominance over Marketplace? TAM?

You are also probably wondering what is the MOAT of the company? Do they have a branding value or some kind of dominance over the Marketplace?

Well, from my point of view, TSM has a significant MOAT against most of its competition as they’ve been able to collect huge amounts of knowledge from its diverse base of over 500 customers which have helped them leap ahead of other companies since the 7NM move in 2018.

TSM pretty much [supplies](https://imgur.com/l5ekttM) all the big companies I mentioned earlier which later pass on the technology to their customers, so it’s very likely that you are using one of their chips in some of your devices, maybe your iPhone, your car, computer or anything else.

You can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/M9MMUfn), the MOAT TSM has over Intel, as Intel is still a long way back, working on older generation chips, while TSM is leading the pack.

I believe their market dominance in the 7NM & 5NM chips will continue to keep TSM as the preferred manufactured for most fabless companies just like Apple which currently [represents](https://imgur.com/TkAR5kR) over 20% of TSM revenues, it seems to me that TSM is the best foundry to own for the next decade, as the worldwide revenue of semis [topped](https://imgur.com/X9iqLlY) $40B to start 2021, with [TSM](https://imgur.com/3unNxtB) being the only one of its pears to see a significant growth, with a big chunk of that coming from the huge demand Apple will provide them for the 5NM chips, which accounts for over 50% of their 5NM [sales](https://imgur.com/OyfFsEN).

Friends, this is just my opinion, but I even dare to say that their total addressable market it’s pretty much limitless in the foreseeable future.

Semiconductors are here to stay as technology will only continue to evolve, with smaller & smaller chips in the future and competitors still struggling to catch up with the 5NM technology that TSM already has, so TSM should be poised to remain one of the biggest companies in the world for the foreseeable future

I believe now is the time we need to get to some of the company’s financials & metrics

# Company Growth & Balance Sheet

Revenue/ Net Income Growth? Profitability?

Let’s start by taking a [look](https://imgur.com/mvUGLnO) at how the companies revenues and gross profit have evolved in the past years, and we can see that with the exception of 2018, TSM has seen a continued growth with 2020 being a booming year as gross profit increased by more than 50% with operating income also increasing by more than 60%, which in my eyes is pretty remarkable given the size of the company.

[TSM](https://imgur.com/jHWdJrY) has managed to post a positive net income in the last 10 years, seeing an increase of over 400% in that same period, so, I hold the opinion that this will continue on the same path for the next 10 years as well 

# Cash / Debt / Net Debt & Dilution

Looking at the balance [sheet](https://imgur.com/MUCFRtx) of the company, we also find that TSM has an excellent financial situation, with over $38B in current assets, which can easily pay off the $22B in current liabilities or the $32B in total current & long-term [liabilities](https://imgur.com/kE1mKDV), so the company is way more than solvent.

# Lastest Earnings Reports & Predictions of Revenue Streams / Cost of Sales & Others

It seems to me that TSM [posted](https://imgur.com/mmqloyJ) some terrific numbers yet again in Q4 of 2020, delivering almost $13B in revenues up 22% YoY with 5NM technology already accounting for 20% of wafer revenue as the 5G technology and super-cycle is just starting, with telecom companies struggling to keep up with the increasing demand.

We can see [here](https://imgur.com/ZGM9b2N) that the 5NM was already the 2nd biggest revenue stream for the company in the 4th quarter and I would say that it’s pretty likely only going to increase, as this only accounted for 8% of 2020’s [revenues](https://imgur.com/RJmakFU), especially as Smartphone [account](https://imgur.com/B7UHPHO) for almost half of TSM revenues from last year, with only the automotive sector seeing a small decline, which was expected, but should recover in the next years, as cars had a bad year given the events of 2020 and they will also very likely contain more & more chips as companies continue to innovate.

TSM also provided a revenue guidance similar to last quarter as gross profit margins are still expected to come in at over 50% 

# Dividends?

One last thing that we should look at before moving on to future projections is how the company is continuing to growth their [dividend](https://imgur.com/Kxhyy2b). 

As far as I am concerned, dividend investing is not really my favorite but this is an important thing to look at when looking for companies to buy to maintain a balanced portfolio.

TSM only offers a $1.79 dividend but this has seen a 13.5% growth rate in the past 5 years and given that things are only getting better, I think this can continue as well.

I guess now’s the time to move on to what is the current upside and the long-term potential for TSM

# Current Upside / Long Term Upside?

First, let’s start with my [expectations](https://imgur.com/r87yUGF) of the revenue streams, costs of goods, operating expenses and capital expenditures.

I believe we can continue to see a steady growth in their total sales, that will end up doubling by 2025, reaching over $108B. On the other side, I also believe we can continue to see a gross margin of 54%, similar with what we saw last quarter.

The other operating expenses from R&D and SG&A I pretty much expect to remain the same, as this has been steady over the years, so, a 2.7% of the revenues should go in SG&A and 8.3% should continue to go into continued R&D to keep the companies MOAT.

I would say that TSM is very likely to continue to invest a lot of money in Capex to keep up with the increasing semiconductors demand, so this should continue to grow at around 2.5%/year.

All of these numbers should get us an operating income of almost $27B for 2025, though, there are other things like interest income & expenses that we should account for, but for TSM, this should add up to a slight gain of $400M in 2025.

Finally the effective tax rate of the [company](https://imgur.com/pkOEifS), has stood under 12% for the last 3 years, but, for safety reasons I will imply a small increase each year, which would [result](https://imgur.com/KbtxhZG) in TSM having a net income of just over $24B in 2025, paying out a dividend of $3.24, while also not diluting their shares, as TSM hasn’t [diluted](https://imgur.com/oflEVtF) their stock significantly since 2005.

# Price to Earnings (PE) Valuation

PE Valuations are my favorite way to quickly & pretty accurately determine reasonable future prices for stocks. 

Taking into account all the numbers we went through earlier, my [view](https://imgur.com/gwgvpXI) is that we can see TSM trading anywhere between a 25 and a 40 PE by 2025, which given the $4.64 EPS for 2025 would mean the stock can trade between $116 and $185, but, before moving on to the final price targets let’s also take a quick look at TSM discounted free cash flow valuation.

# DCF 

I [implied](https://imgur.com/hNWP9E2) the same growth rate for TSM revenues and actually lowered their EBIT as a % of their revenues each year by .5%, and after taking into account their effective tax rate, their D&A, capital expenditures and net working capital I arrived at a $71.5B free cash flow by 2025.

As always I also added their net assets and used a 3% long-term growth rate just to be conservative and for the perpetuity approach we got a price target of $86, meaning the company is potentially overvalued at the moment, though, on the other hand, the EBITDA approach, using a 20x multiplier, would results in a price target of $178. 

I like to use an average approach of this numbers, which would results in a price target of $132, or a 21% upside in the next 12 months for the company, not including any additional dividends received.

# Technical Chart

Looking at a short-term [chart](https://imgur.com/qgvPpXM), we find that TSM is pretty underbought right now with an RSI of 36, but the volumes in the stock are slightly increasing.

It seems to me that the next support level for TSM stands at $103 while the next resistance is just above my 12-month price target for the company, as TSM had a fake breakout over $135 in the middle of last month.

# Wall St. Opinion

I always take a look after I’ve finished my DD to what analysts say, and in this case, they have a $137 PT for the [company](https://imgur.com/xAVfqN4) slightly higher than my own DD, so it seems I was pretty accurate with my expectations.

[Analysts](https://imgur.com/l6EndWo) also expect a 72B on average, while my estimates are the top end of their range, but on the other hand, I only have an EPS of 4.64$ in 2025, compared to $5.6 expected by them by 2023.

# Weaknesses

When looking at what companies you should invest in, it’s recommended to also take into account their potential weaknesses.

I have no doubt that TSM does have some weaknesses, but probably the biggest one is that they really so much on their Apple revenues, though, it’s hard to believe Apple will move away from TSM anytime soon, or even if that happens that TSM won’t find other customers in need of their products in a short period of time, especially now with the huge worldwide chip shortage.

While writing this post, we also received [news](https://imgur.com/MCjAWXZ) from INTEL that they are planning on building 2 new foundries in Arizona. This might provide even more pressure on the current price of TSM, but, in my humble opinion, i think this just more buzz, with Intel still laggining behind in technology, not even having the 7NM available, while TSM is already working on 2 & 3NM developments. So, i'd take this as another opportunity to ""buy the dip""

# Short Selling? Institutional Holding?

The company has such a solid future that the percentage of [shares](https://imgur.com/wl06zGs) sold on the short side is under .3%, which is one of the lowest I have ever seen in a company.

Though, on the other hand, the stock isn’t that largely [owned](https://imgur.com/ndoKXcs) by institutions, with JP Morgan leading the pack with under 1%, buy, my guess is that’s because this isn’t a US based company, which does make it less attractive to big investment banks & funds.

I bet that you are just waiting to see the final price targets and my final opinion, so let’s jump to that right now

# Final Opinion & Prediction!

In my [opinion](https://imgur.com/P7OQKtb), TSM is a must have stock in most portfolios, brining some balance, with good growth ahead of it. TSM might helped lower the beta of most portfolios that are way to heavy on the overhyped tech stocks right now.

Remember, this is just my humble opinion as a retail investor, this is not an investment advice, but my view is that we can see TSM moving towards the $132 range by early next year, with TSM likely to be jump-started again around their next [earnings](https://imgur.com/ClXzJZG) report in April 

Regarding the long-term [view](https://imgur.com/dgQTLy7), my base TSM target is $150 by 2025, meaning an ROI of 38% which is not that great, but when taking into account the expected dividends received from TSM, that can jump to over 50% 

Speaking personally, my 2025 Price [Targets](https://imgur.com/9ZWdcb5) for TSM range from an average of the 25 & 30 PE multiple, my base case from the 30 & 35, while my bull case averages de 35 & 40 PE multiple prices.

03/25/2021,stocks,INTC is USA 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸. Never bet against 🇺🇸
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thank you so much for posting this! I've never done any proper DD before and actually had decided yesterday that TSM would be the first company I'd give it a go at. Your analysis will serve as a great guide and I think will help me to understand the overall process and what to make of all of the information.

That being said, what do you think is a good entry price?"
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m broke so couldn’t afford tsmc so instead I bought 2021 leaps for AMD..lil bro will do just fine as well 🙏🏾🙏🏾
03/25/2021,stocks,Would you be so kind as to share a blank template? I haven't come across any DCFs on Sheets.
03/25/2021,stocks,nice!
03/25/2021,stocks,i understand your choice
03/25/2021,stocks,thats why you gotta yolo on SOXL man
03/25/2021,stocks,"What if the winner is some company outside of smh.  For example samsung, smic, media tech..."
03/25/2021,stocks,Do you also plan on picking up any individual shares of TSM (or any of the other etf holdings) in the future?
03/25/2021,stocks,Nice that makes sense to me too. ARM is the future
03/25/2021,stocks,Yes they only design them. They don’t actually make them... seems everyone has mostly the same issue with china... that has been the case for decades. How much would you have lost thinking like that? Don’t go 100% on any company... a 1-3% of a portfolio in tsm seems pretty safe. Even if they go bust. 3% is nothing really
03/25/2021,stocks,And what's the result? I can only guess that AMD is a much better experience
03/25/2021,stocks,"i agree, they are very hard behind... behind even AMD in chip design"
03/25/2021,stocks,"My concern at this point is that the Federal government props up Intel and gives them unfair advantages over TSM. 

I have a substantial stake in TSM and believe they are an excellent company with no true peers. 

However, political uncertainty in the US and China does worry me a bit. If TSM were based in the US, they’d be a lot better off. 
I hope that their factories in Arizona help dissuade fears."
03/25/2021,stocks,appreciate it!
03/25/2021,stocks,"They’ve been talking about graphene chips for ages. 
I’m not saying it won’t happen, but I’m saying it shouldn’t dissuade you from investing in TSM or other existing chip manufacturers. 

Even if Graphene is the future, you can bet it will be a company like TSM that takes advantage of it."
03/25/2021,stocks,very interesting! thanks!
03/25/2021,stocks,"I would say we are at least 20 years off graphene. It's nowhere near the point of being able to scale and compete cost wise. 

I've always thought that graphene would end up competing with light based processing to steal the crown from silicon."
03/25/2021,stocks,"People focusing on Intel not having the best tech in the sector, but Intel is currently trading at a P/E of ~12.5, which makes it a compelling choice regardless of the tech disadvantage."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah I had a few days of it making solid, incremental gains and I thought I was a genius. Then it began the long, steep decline."
03/25/2021,stocks,ASML is another good play as well... Selling the machinery for millions & millions
03/25/2021,stocks,TSM is also building in Arizona
03/25/2021,stocks,I don't really invest in other countries but TSM seems pretty solid
03/25/2021,stocks,TSMC is building a 10B fab in Arizona.
03/25/2021,stocks,Dumbass alert
03/25/2021,stocks,"this is a very good template:

03/25/2021,stocks,There won’t be just 1 winner
03/25/2021,stocks,"Nobody talks enough about Samsung, they also have 5nm and have had it since before TSMC, they also seem to appear on par with TSMC when it comes to density.

I'm still a deeply INTC guy tho, they will retake their throne, they always do."
03/25/2021,stocks,just buy those as well if you like them on the side
03/25/2021,stocks,"for me, it's possible, but i'd like to see it dip more before I consider starting a position in TSM. I also have 104 shares of AMD at $23, so that's already one semi position I have outside SMH. AMD is not in the fund's top 10 holdings so I'm fine with that, but TSM is their top holding with about 14% so I feel I have pretty good exposure to TSM already."
03/25/2021,stocks,"AMD demolishes it despite comparable CPUs. I have a developer laptop that should in theory be close but it’s leagues behind. Same RAM. VPN excluded from performance comparison too. There’s a reason that when people have a choice of custom specs in their own computers, they go with AMD. 90% of pcmasterrace and buildapc laugh Intel out of the conversation for good reason imo."
03/25/2021,stocks,you do realise TSM isnt based in china right?
03/25/2021,stocks,"The US can favor Intel, but you can't magically push innovation.

Intel's problem isn't money. They have plenty of that. It's culture, talent, and toxic marketing mentality."
03/25/2021,stocks,I think that's part of the strategy of opening the place in Arizona.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah, for sure. If anything, I see it more as a call to buy into the logistics of graphene chip manufacturing early on. Applied Graphene Materials on the UK exchange is at a low cost of just 52 cents at the moment. I anticipate stocks regarding graphene processing will see a boost as a result of the technology when it becomes more common."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, no problemo! It does seem like graphene is a largely untapped market. Applied Graphene Materials PLC on the UK exchange is only at 52 cents at the moment, so while it could be a long term look out, dumping a bunch of cash into it now could turn into a hefty payout later."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, there's a lot of upgrades to be made in the processing in order to make it happen. Usually in chip tech, only one aspect makes a step forward at a time to move the tech forward, but with graphene, you have to alter the entire process. 

Though, I gotta say, from what it looked in the documentary I watched, MIT has it all pretty well figured out. And at the rate chips are shrinking, think we're down to 3nm now, it won't be but a few more generations before silicon hits a wall in regards to transistor size. I'm not sure I'd put graphene chips as far out as 20 years, maybe 10-15, but for a conservative estimate 20 sounds reasonable."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Intel looks very solid right now. Its not a sexy buy, but when it comes down to it the numbers look great for them. P/S, P/B and PE look good and its not as if they havnt been growing the last few years. Their overall revenue and operating cash flow are also very solid. It has the best fundamentals of the semiconductor stocks I have looked at. Most other semiconductor stocks seem to be trading with a lot of growth priced in wheras intel seems to be expected to drop. Comparing the fundamentals of intel to something like Nvidia is crazy. I could understand the difference if intel were stagnant or performing poorly, but they have been posting comparable revenue/earnings growth to TSM with significantly larger revenues. Sure intell may be behind in tech, but that doesnt seem to be giving their competitors much of an advantage."
03/25/2021,stocks,They also destroyed their Q4 earnings
03/25/2021,stocks,Here we go with PE again lol.
03/25/2021,stocks,"theyre still a Taiwanese company, CCP can seize all their assets if they decide to invade Taiwan, its too risky right now. Alot of tension going on within China and all these hacks against the US government and private companies."
03/25/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/25/2021,stocks,Does not make them a US company. If you are a US investor you take a huge risk in buying single issue Asian securities. Have you hedged your FX risk?
03/25/2021,stocks,I dumbed down the comment for the likes of morons like you. Who think investing in an ADR trading at 11 x revenue with added geopolitical and FX risks is a good play. Do some DD.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Much thanks! Didn't read the username, I stumbled across your youtube videos before"
03/25/2021,stocks,i agree
03/25/2021,stocks,What’s the Samsung ticker for their semiconductor business? I know in Korea they have a metric shitton of different companies under the Samsung group
03/25/2021,stocks,>yeah... was expecting that... i made a DD on AMD a couple of weeks ago
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes which is a big part of the problem. China wants Taiwan and TSM is a major strategic asset. 

Imagine a hypothetical scenario in which the whole world relies on TSM technology and there are no other major semiconductor fabs. China seizes that or otherwise fucks with TSM and everyone is at their mercy. 

I’m not saying it’s likely to happen, but one has to consider the precarious situation Taiwan is in when discussing TSM."
03/25/2021,stocks,"plus new factories new ceo, lots of good things happening for intel rn"
03/25/2021,stocks,"With 16% loss in network sector you think they destroyed Q4?

I can only assume you meant destroy in a negative way, because I cannot imagine 16% loss is a good thing..."
03/25/2021,stocks,"With the added benefit of *not* being the market leader and being technology-wise not on par with TSM.

Biden's ""made in USA"" stimuli will not last forever."
03/25/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/25/2021,stocks,No problem! Appreciate it!
03/25/2021,stocks,Samsung is not in NYSE.   It's in a number of foreign exchanges.
03/25/2021,stocks,Think that's the problem - there is no dedicated semiconductor ticker for Samsung. So you get exposed to a bunch of noise from the mobile phone / electronic markets.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I get that Intel looks good from a value standpoint. Makes total sense and I’m not dismissing it. It’s just that as a consumer and IT hobbyist, I buy what I believe in based on personal experience."
03/25/2021,stocks,"China will never get Taiwan lol, the Modern country is too politically connected to just get absorbed."
03/25/2021,stocks,Wow? Are you new to investing? That is an American depositary receipt. It does not insulate you from FX moves. You also may have no voting rights. Do some DD on what you actually own. A China US Cold War or worse could make your ADR worthless.
03/25/2021,stocks,But do they look good after a 33% rise since october? Have to see some results before thinking again... Anyone can say they are turning around their company or something like that... actually doing it is the hard part... Gelsinger is a real showman... Now we have to see what the results are
03/25/2021,stocks,Just like Ukraine?
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think the potential to manufacture everything in house is huge. But so much goes into chip factories. We’re 3-4 years out from that for them and I feel they are clearly already behind in tech as it is. I don’t see anything groundbreaking between now and then happening, but who knows?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ukraine, or parts of it that you are referring to, is totally incomparable to Taiwan"
03/25/2021,stocks,agreed
2021-03-25 15:49:37,stocks,"This is not the first correction.... but online it seems that way So this market correction / correction is not new. It happens all the time. But reading the boards / forum you wold think this is something new. Heck, even the over-analyzing on CNBC makes this appear like we are in some sort of uncharted territory. 

I am new to this. I got in at the peak as well (like some of you). I was up 20% in Feb, but now down to maybe 2% up if that ( I don’t want to check).

I am in it for the long. I still panicked, and made some changes, selling at a loss and rebuying to diversify my profile a bit. 

I think what would be helpful is to hear from people who were in this in the past , how they handled it and how they got out of the rut.

I am also convinced the so called analysts on TV don’t know jack. Even Cramer... (as an example , 2 weeks ago he was saying PLTR was a good buy at the dip, now he is saying it’s too expensive... I mean seriously) 

Anyways, good trading day to all"
03/25/2021,stocks,"These forums are full of new traders who got into stocks during a very heavy bull market.  They tend to be overly into tech and tend to completely ignore valuation, which is killing them.  

Average trader with a balanced portfolio is probably down 5%, Redditors are probably down 20%"
03/25/2021,stocks,Cut out the noise. A majority of Financial news that spews a narrative instead of facts and the talking heads on CNBC/Bloomberg TV are paid to create drama and controversy. That's how they sell ads.
03/25/2021,stocks,Don’t do anything with your portfolio. Do a house project or something and reassess in July
03/25/2021,stocks,"This correction was long overdue, and I’ve just stopped checking my portfolio incessantly like I used to. Now I just let it do it’s thing and just keep slowly DCA’ing into my forever holds, like $MSFT."
03/25/2021,stocks,"There seems to be so much drama regarding the markets, but the S&P 500 is just 3% from its all time highs. By all definitions, this isn't even close to being a correction.

It makes me wonder *just what the hell* did people buy?"
03/25/2021,stocks,The market is emotional because people are emotional. If you have faith in your positions just DCA and wait that long game babyyyy
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think the reason for this noise is a lot of new people started investing since last year as the market dropped and people found themselves working at home with extra cash in hand.

Market is not even in correction territory right now and have more downside potential than upside. Do not listen to analysts on tv. They have to create content to earn a livelihood so I dont blame them but take their words with a grain of salt. Their opinions are worse than weather predictions. Look at the charts and see how strange this past year has been.

I am keeping cash handy for the inevitable next big drop."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Do your research on the stocks that you are in. Do you think they are worth more than they are valued at now? If yes, just hold. A lot of the time I find it helpful to think about taxes, if you sell for a short term gain you have to give up your annual tax rate to the feds. (I generally just guess about 25-30%). If you hold for a year that drops to 15%. So if you like a stock, why sell and give up 1/3rd of your gains when you can hold, see it go back up and then only pay 15%."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I spent two years in the red and closed the third in the green, doing DCA all the way, never closing a position, and sticking to my longs.
Just relax, if you are in it for the long run, these are just chances to accumulate at lower price.
Don't take losses unless your thesis has changed. Just buy every month or quarter or whatever and stick to your thesis.
If you trade, you most likely have a strategy indipendent of market condition, otherwise you're just speculating and/or buying momentum."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Peter Lynch One up on Wall Street - that will give you some great perspective of a successful career over 30 years of dips, corrections, crashes. IF you have Kindle unlimited, you can even read it as part of your subscription.

I am also new to this, got into trading in January, was up and now am down to about level. I sold some positions at profit, and reinvested in some new ones, or even the same ones after the dip - like VLO.

The main thing I am learning is that there is so much noise from so called experts who are experts at talking (or writing) but nothing much else. Lynch describes this almost perfectly in his book."
03/25/2021,stocks,Let the FOMO begin
03/25/2021,stocks,"“I am in it for the long” 

“I still panicked and made some changes, selling at a loss”

Lol you can’t really be in it for the long haul if you see some red and start selling. 

Advice: if you don’t have conviction in what you’re buying you’re always going to panic on red days"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I held AAPL when it went from 200 to 80 during the recession. I still have every one of those shares. 

If the guys on TV were experts, they’d be billionaires on yachts, not chumps in a cable tv studio."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Corrections make you a better investor. You often learn how to read stocks value better instead of just buying companies you like. The first time I invested a correction started the very next day. I sold out of one of my buys and bought a different stock with better fundamentals at the time. I left everything else alone other than buying more, and still beat the S&P for the year."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I was up +30k in January, now just under +10k. I also moved so much money from my savings to the market that my savings went from 5 figures to 4 figures - first time in many many years I now have a 4 figure sum in my savings account. Makes me a little uneasy, but at the same time - confident, in the long run. 

Yes Tech took a big hit, but the type of tech stocks also matter. If you bought your tech from the opinions on others, from FOMO, or because its the latest Reddit trend - well, good luck. Otherwise, if you did your DD and invested in the strong competitors - then sit back and relax."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’ve been investing for about a decade and trading actively for a year now. I don’t look at my long term portfolio at all. It’s fairly diversified and when there’s a major dip, like March 2020, I buy more shares. I have about 40 years left to go through several financial meltdowns until I’ll start switching into less volatile things. For now, stocks it is.

I got into options a year ago right at the bottom of the market crash. Ever since I’ve been following the news and markets actively every single day. It’s tricky because you need to follow it if you’re actively involved, however, there is way too much noise and most of it is distracting. 
Literally every single person has a different view on the market. You’re buying a stock because you believe in the company, well you’re getting it from someone who wants to get rid of it. 

Find an approach that you’re comfortable with. You won’t find it on cnbc or hear it from some expert, it’s the experiences that you make and how comfortable you feel with different approaches that determines what kind of investor/trader you’re going to be. It’s difficult to settle with the thought that this journey and finding out where it goes will cost you money. But lost money on an opportunity or misinterpreted trade is literally the best lesson there is, and it sticks. Non of the tips anyone can give you will result in you believing it like when you experienced it firsthand.

With that being said, try out all the stuff that you’re interested in. Read into all the different methods and put them to use. Watch your position size and maybe put your trades and associated feelings in a journal, it will help tremendously.

Have fun! :)"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Panic , fear , controversy sells.... is the same for all news channels as well. 

Everything is cyclical, hopefully you had some gas in the tank to buy during the sale."
03/25/2021,stocks,Lol @ selling for a loss. You will learn one day.
03/25/2021,stocks,"hey just some words,

just because you think youre in it for the long hall, does not mean you should not take profits when presented with the opportunity.

The reason being is you dont know what will happen in 30 years. All you really can guess is whether a company will be around in 5 years. whether it will be up or down is just a best guess."
03/25/2021,stocks,\*nods and smiles\* First time?
03/25/2021,stocks,S&P is down 3% off the high. Hahaha
03/25/2021,stocks,"I recently started investing. I’m 17, and have been learning for a year or two now bit by bit.

I have roughly half of my money on my account invested, and plan to slowly invest the rest of it in a few ETFs that i’ve chosen (namely INRG and a few others, mostly pertaining to clean energy).

Do you believe that’s sensible given the current volatility, or should i try another approach?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Lol, not even 20% correction and everyone loses their mind. What will happen when a new 2008 bear market comes out?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Overall market is on a general uptrend.  It's higher than it was on March 8th.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Buy. The. Dips.

The companies you believe are good haven't fundamentally changed, just the price."
03/25/2021,stocks,I've been in the markets for 40 years.  I always sit through volatility.  It pays off in the end but it takes immense patience.
03/25/2021,stocks,What you guys want advise from boomers now. You want stability but worship at the alter of disruption lol go buy arkk on the dip. She says wait ten years why the sadness?
03/25/2021,stocks,CNBC and MarketWatch have proven they collude with hedge funds to take your money. Ignore anything they say.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm down on almost all of my stocks, probably down >15% since February. I started investing in January, so this has been a rough beginning for me, considering I bought at the peak of every single one before they all tanked LOL  


I'm not worried one bit, I'm in it for the long haul. I check my stocks maybe once a week. Take some time away from your investment apps (seriously, this eased my stress so much), realize that corrections happen, and that things will bounce back. Give it time."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Most people who joined have no interest in investing. They joined because their family or friend told them about the easy money and then they thought it's the new fad. In a few months, this will go away. Very few will actually want to learn how to invest and will blow their money away once the economy opens. It's just the reality.

I'm personally down 10% from ATH but I like the companies I am investing in. A few are riskier than others but nothing I'm upset about long-term wise. I feel like people are using the term correction too loosely here. 20% dropping in a risky market isn't a correction - it's starting to be more and more common here. Timing is everything if you're playing short-term stocks. But if you're not, hang tight and let it ride out.   


And if you're new, seriously, stop looking to GME and AMC and generalize that as 'investing.'"
03/25/2021,stocks,Is this even really a correction? Seems like the market has just generally been sideways for like a month now.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Tune out the noise. 

Invest in good companies and sometimes you gotta just walk away... let the market do it's thing."
03/25/2021,stocks,Just bought some more stock of a company I liked and was able to reduce my cost basis on the position in doing so.  Why are people complaining???
03/25/2021,stocks,from last march s&p is still over 70%....people need to calm down
03/25/2021,stocks,a month or two ago I sold most of my stocks and just bought into a whole market index fund. much less stressful
03/25/2021,stocks,"I don't understand the reason for this correction though. It doesn't make much sense why CNK would take such a massive dump, RSI with great potential and gambling/betting legalization. HEXO with incoming Cannabis legalization.

I'm not even one of the guys purely into tech, it's a mix of value/covid recovery stocks and growth stocks. But they're all down bigly and my portfolio shrank by 20% over the last 1-2 weeks."
03/25/2021,stocks,"2% in a week isn't a ""Correction"""
03/25/2021,stocks,"There are three pillars that hold up stocks. 

The first is momentum...which is everything from memes to technical analysis. This predicts very short term performance. If that fails, we move to the second pillar 

The second pillar is valuation. This is where we are at now. Stocks are trading at too high of a multiple with rates rising so you're seeing multiples compress.

Most people forget there is a third pillar, which is the most important of all three. And that is revenue growth. Over the long run almost all price performance in the stock market can be attributed to revenue growth. Even if the price of a stock stays flat, a company growing at 50% will rapidly lower its multiple in 12 months. Now imagine a company that grows revenue 5x or 10x over a few years. All of a sudden valuation doesn't matter as much and growth takes over.

We were in a bubble and you have to accept not everything will come back. But don't sell your companies that have highly visible and glaringly obvious growth. Sell your crap and double down on these. Growth always wins in the end."
03/25/2021,stocks,The S&P 500 is down 3% and you call this a correction? Lol
03/25/2021,stocks,Because making $10 feels good but losing $5 is trauma. Human beings remember the pain more.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I love how a number of people are going all political on this correction as if the current government had any control over the huge overvaluation on stocks over the last several months. Stocks don't go up 100% without going back down and so many have gone up multiple times that. I don't like the correction but I see it for what it is. Stocks don't just go up and this was needed to re-balance things for the next run. Be nice to see a normal market for a bit with steady movement and less memes but that probably is just me... Dips happen all the time, what is unusual is how quickly the market climbed over the last 12 months. This is largely due to no fee trades and a huge influx of retail investors in my opinion. Subsequently we are in uncharted waters on how this dip will run but it is just a dip. Time to reduce risk a bit and find some safer plays, that is all."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Some stocks such as PLTR have already fallen nearly 50%... but it keeps falling like a bankrupt company would continue falling.. 

Right now I still have 40% of my capital free....do I keep buying the dips or wait?... 

&#x200B;

I also own BABA and am thinking of using my capital to DCA on that...   despite the SEC scare.. BABA is a top 10 stock by the major hedgefunds at [dataroma.com](https://dataroma.com).

There's no way the influence of those people will allow BABA to be delisted..   this scare could be a great opportunity to buy in.... but then again.. how do we know it won't keep dropping and dropping..

&#x200B;

There's no right or wrong move right now I believe... It takes courage to buy and it also takes courage to sit back and be patient.. only the future determines who was right or wrong."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I consider this the second big tree shakeup. I was in on GME late January, and paper handed everything in the early days of FEb.

I got back in on GME again before this last rise. This time around, I didn’t shakeup any of my portfolio when it dipped, and actually added more. I wish I held through the January drop, but since I’ve read sooo much more since then, I’m really not worried about the price drop right now and it actually almost gives me more confidence in the stock."
03/25/2021,stocks,Bruh.. Correction??? Wait till you see indexes pulling down 7 or 8 %. That are corrections. This is nothing
03/25/2021,stocks,Lmfao just hodl and stop looking at your apps. Go outside. I never understood this. If you INVESTED then you shouldn’t expect an immediate return. How do we keep seeing these doomsday posts?
03/25/2021,stocks,"You didn't get in on the peak.  I did.

My entire life, I have had an irrational fear/pessimism about the stock market.  However, with my money making a pittance in interest even in a High Yield account, I said fuck it and put over 100K in mid-Februrary.  Literally a day or two before all this schizophrenic movement. lol  

I'm confident in the long term outlook but damn does this immediate, short-term ding hurt and reinforce all of my life-long doubts/fears."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Do you remember market sentiment on March 1st 2016? How about November 23rd 2011? What about February 18th 2009? Nobody remembers because it doesn’t matter anymore and in 3 years nobody is going to remember about today’s market sentiment. The point is that how you feel about the market today is meaningless if you truly are invested long term. Regarding the analysts one of the first things I learned years ago was to take everything they say with a grain of salt. I jumped on a few trades based off of advice from the people on CNBC and got burned on a few and made money on a few. It’s like a 50-50 risk therefore it’s just not worth even getting in. Now I use the analysts as a way to gauge macro sentiment. Another thing I’ve noticed is that they are past thinking, reactionary and that is the opposite of what an investor needs to succeed. You have to be forward thinking.

The feeling of something new happening is being caused by all the new investors going through their first dip and getting burned for the first time. There is nothing new going on here minus the GME stuff. This has happened before countless times and will happen again."

03/25/2021,stocks,"So... I started investing just before the dotcom burst. Lol.    


We (bunch of us who worked together) were a bunch of kids (16-24) with \*way\* to much income... running an dotcom telco/isp/clec.  We were throwing money around like candy on stupid shit, lost a lot of money too.  When the dotcom burst started, I re-evaluated my portfolio as best I could (I was still pretty rank newbie) on the advice of the company vp who had been investing for a couple decades (in his 50s) I liquidated (and lost money) on the \*worst\* (overvalued) companies I was invested in and bought shares in companies with solid financials on the way down (it wasn't at the bottom by any means.)   Then after a few more weeks of bleeding out, I quit checking my stocks for a couple years... went from a peak of \~50k invested at like 19-20 to something like \~15k and saw no end in sight and just couldn't emotionally deal with it and our company closing and being a gaming addict at the time and... etc... and if I'm being real... just kinda put it out of mind and wanted to forget losing that much money after being laid off.

  
Roll around a few years later 2005ish?, good steady job, buying a house, needed cash for a down payment, decide to check my old investment account and old never rolled up 401k's and such-- well I was pleasantly surprised... took about 1/2 for down payment, 1/4th for taxes, and 1/4th to further invest, lost a lot of the later in 2008 on speculating options plays I didn't really understand at the time. shrug.    


I learned some good lessons about investing, investing in companies you believe in and that have solid financials long term is a safety net to some degree, there is nothing wrong with speculating, but understand what you're doing and don't risk money speculating you're not prepared to flush away.  


There is no magic answer of what is right or wrong, just what works with your assets, risk tolerance, and time frame in the present market.  If you're concerned about a crash best I can offer is-- do your dd right, make sure the fundamentals are there, buy in during the point you think its as close to bottom as you're comfortable waiting for, and... then then quit watching constantly.   


Doesn't work with active trading, but it's not a bad plan long term for passive trading in companies you believe will grow given time or if you can't cope emotionally with the constant losses.

Find what works for you and your situation, but sometimes, emotionally and financially, walking away is the best option."
03/25/2021,stocks,"**Warren Buffet says the stock market only store people sell when it goes on sale**.  If I buy a stock, I've hopefully done my due diligence and i'm looking at the 3 and 5 years out I don't care if it dips here and there, plus starting Jan we knew the re-opening was going to be volatile and tech stocks would be hit hard.  If you want slow and steady jump into value, blue chip or index funds. 

If you don't like the losses you should have an exit strategy in place. Personally i'm down 30-40% on some stocks. At the time I looked at where I thought they will be in 1, 3 and 5 years and bought. The earliest I'd evaluate their performance is later part this year or 2022, its tough to predict the short term but much easier to predict the long term.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Think of CNBC as a misguided Shepard of the retail flock.  The Shepard works hand in glove with the Market Makers to try ti steer your money where they would like it to be.  Often, it’s bag holding after an initial slight gain.  

Then as money piles into stocks (or whatever they are pushing), they send out their paid analysts and people like Mike Santoli to inform you your picks are getting “overheated” or “stretched”.  

Cue the Market Makers who now short the positions causing panic and a rotation to where they would like you to go next (like Silver🤣).

It's not easy, and it may dip more but if it's below your cost basis, you bought it before at a higher price.... Why wouldn't you buy at a discount?

03/25/2021,stocks,"Umm, well I was in it deep this time last year and I gotta say that it feels really familiar but in a totally different way. Recently I've been losing gains which sucks but I feel for the people who got into the market between Jan and now, even buying through the dips have been awful.

Last year on Feb 20th the drop started, same shit as this year. Last year end of March was the worst, I think the 23rd was the worst day and it spiked back and forth until April when it picked up and never looked back. Probably the same shit will happen here, April will hit, most states will be open for all vaccine ages, literally a few weeks from now, but man it sucks right now. I slept through last Sept-October during the last correction and glad I didn't touch anything, regretting not buying anything until the rebound was more secure. 

Like I said, same as last year but less of a fall and for different reasons. A lot of people are scared, they don't want a crash, they don't want to lose their gains, big funds are moving money around to prepare for reopening. I don't know what the spark will be to stablize the market and allow growth naturally but it will happen eventually, but look on the bright side, people won't be bitching about overvaluations again until we recover, inflation can't keep being a fear if numbers continue to roll in that it's not some big cover up and eventually the market overall will hit a resistance level."

One thing I would say is this is why it's important to always keep your portfolio in a size and risk weighting which is comfortable for you. Some people do go in hard on a narrow selection of stocks. If you can handle a drop then that is fine, but what you must never do is get pushed out and not get back in. Almost all stock market horror stories have one thing in common - panic selling.

Most people are still driving a gasoline car. Planes and ships are still on gasoline.

I’ve invested because of how cheap renewables are getting per kWh compared to fossil fuels (non-residential solar even beats natural gas now on cost). I don’t understand the excitement over electronic vehicles, but optimism in the green energy sector is merited. But right now, their performance is tightly correlated. Everyone will fall, some will rise back up. 

I could be wrong, but it’s hard to see how green energy doesn’t grow massively over the future. It isn’t a political question anymore - solar has moved from $340 per kWh to $33 and is still dropping. And in a non-selfish way, putting my money to help them raise collateral to grow is better than anything I can do with that money in the meantime.

03/25/2021,stocks,"... I have been trading since .com crash, 9/11, housing bubble and recent cr\*p.

Investing is complex, if you trust the companies you bought ... then unplug from the news/reddit and stop looking at your portfolio.  Look back in 6 months or maybe a year.

Volatility is to be expected.  Hedgies love volatility.   Be weary of setting low sell limits, hedgies love when those hit when they short ... they kinda want that.  If you stock you own has good market cap, looks like will can weather a storm ... then sit tight and stop looking at your crap.

If you bough last 2 months, probably we on high side ... but who knows right?  Each company is different, each sector is different too.  Also with money being pumped into economy by gov nobody truly knows.  Also market is flush with cash, because hey were else are people going to put money to invest with interest rates in the crapper.

Always good to invest in healthy companies and those with a good market cap (so hedgies dont move them artificially) and that you personally believe has growth potential or staying power.  If they pay dividends too, then bonus ... you can play the holding game.

I dont have good advice, you should make your own choices.  But more often than not it is best to not be emotional.   If you truly believe in your stock, then double and triple down.    When you feel kick in the b\*lls, buy 2/3 of original position in same stock and it tanks more ... and you feel more kick in the b\*lls and getting nightmares at night, them buy another 1/3 of original value.  Then unplug and check back in six months.   But the company much be healthy and large and can weather a storm.  Even then you maybe wrong ... but with some guts and commitment you wont make money either.  Often the correct action is exactly the opposite of what you feel it should be.

**EDIT:**  I want to add, the opposite is true too.  When you feel elated about your stocks, then when you on cloud 9.  You can always sell 1/3 of original position.   Then if it keeps going and again you feel high .. then 2/3 more ... and forget about the rest and let it ride.

Trading is mostly a physiological game with yourself.  Big hedgies know this very well.

Always only ever invest what you can loose or stomach and stay away from margin.

Happy trading."
03/25/2021,stocks,Jim Cramer is a glorified pumper.
03/25/2021,stocks,"This all reminds me so much right before the dotcom crash.  All sorts of new retail investors piling in, used to only bull markets, and not knowing that to expect or how to feel when things stopped rocketing upwards.  Sure to be buying little dips, not realizing that they were headed for a cliff that make these ""dips"" from the highs look like an imperceptible blip on the charts.

Then they got burned and many got out.  Some held through it.  Those that held and kept adding while the market was down came out way ahead in the end...as long as the companies they invested in survived.

The way to get through it is to remember that you're in it for the long term.  You're buying Apple now not because you hope it will go to 140 soon, but because you know that 10 years from now it will likely be 250+.  You're buying an S&P Index fund because you know that in the long run it will hit 5K, then 6K, then 7K.

At the time of the crash and the years after I was incredibly frustrated.  I stopped paying attention to the markets almost altogether, and just kept making my regular monthly contributions.  I was determined to save.  Even if my investments went nowhere, at least this self-forced saving would leave me a small nest egg years down the line.

Then the markets started to recover.  At that point I was kicking myself.  Why did I only contribute 3000k/yr?  I could have contributed $5K/yr instead for those 10 years, and I would have been much, much further ahead.  Now I contribute much more, and even as the market goes sideways and maybe will crash I will keep on contributing, knowing that when we come out the other side my pot of shares will be much bigger and ready to really take off."

03/25/2021,stocks,This is a correction? Lol
03/25/2021,stocks,"This is why the age old advice still rings true today: “it’s not about timing the market, it’s about time in the market”.

Be grateful for these dips because it allows you to buy more. Sell at a loss if you absolutely want to, but I personally am holding and buying more for eventually when it will come back up."
03/25/2021,stocks,TIL people consider this a correction. I was not aware something was/is going on.
03/25/2021,stocks,"huh ? why did you sell at a loss ?

i dont care how much im down as long as i have my positions, prices and DD. market can go hang until i have to sell."
03/25/2021,stocks,Blip on the radar. Put down the copium and don’t sell.
03/25/2021,stocks,A lot of stimulus money came in to play the stock game aaaaaaaand it's gone.
03/25/2021,stocks,Loved it! Took the opportunity to average down or simply increase positions in my favorite stocks.  This is where the money is truly made!
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m tech heavy so I’m also down. Still overall positive. In my long term account that I’ve had since 2016 I’m still up very nicely with my boring indexes.
03/25/2021,stocks,Every correction is the new stock market crash ;)
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yup it sucks to be down but if you're as young as most redditors probably are and haven't invested so much you can't pay your mortgage, you're going to be just fine. Imagine selling last March during the covid panic."

03/25/2021,stocks,"What correction? We peaked at 33,202 a week ago and we’re only at 32,400+. That’s under a 2.5% change from the ALL TIME HIGH. 

Are you so new to the market that small normal fluctuations freak you out or did I miss something?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Trading stocks for a long time.  Be brave when people are panicking.  Today's dip will turn into tomorrow's gain.   I almost get as excited when stocks really dip - because that's the opportunity to make money and increase positions.  

Remember the stock market is a mechanism to transfer money from the impatient to the patient."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Every correction is an opportunity. Remember, be greedy when others are fearful (and vice versa)."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I don't see any corrections, just a lot of opportunities to buy some stock on discount, especially since I avoided it for being so expensive.

I'm looking at you $SQ and $CHWY."
03/25/2021,stocks,"What correction?  VTI is up 5% YTD!!!!

People forget that it's about risk adjusted returns ..."
03/25/2021,stocks,"No, it's not.  

But, at the same time I think it would be dishonest to call this completely normal.  The 1 year return for the S&P500 right now is like 29% compared to a historical average of 5.83%.  We've also hit new ATHs like twice in the past month, and followed those up with 2 to 3% pullbacks each time.  That isn't exactly normal.

The last year has really done a disservice to traders.  There are people, lots of them, who started trading and paying attention in the last year and many of them are very happy because the market has clearly outperformed.  Just a return to normal will be a letdown from those highs, and depending on how bold and risky those investors got, a full on bear market could be devastating to them.

I have no great advice.  Have a plan, allocate according to risk.  If you want to gamble on meme stocks and options, do so, but do so knowing you could lose all or most of it.  If you want to invest long term then do so, but let me recommend the index and selling options in that case.  Good luck."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I looked at the ARK funds and which stocks had 2 year growth of 190% or more, indicative of a 40% fall in value coming in the next 2 years. 

It’s only been 3 weeks and 12 of 28 of those stocks have fallen by 40% or more. 

Pelloton is one of today’s."
03/25/2021,stocks,"In my opinion this current market dip is from people who got into the market a year ago, and are now cashing out because they are now into the long-term capital gains taxation. I think the amount of people who got in a year ago when things really went south is underestimated. This dip may be short lived, but may also be a small reset from the short-term-“long-term”-investors. The stocks will go up (and down) over time, but will mostly just go up if you are actually in it for long term. 
Non-professional stock advice: hold (or hodl), whatever you want to call it just don’t panic. Patience is key."
03/25/2021,stocks,This too shall pass.
03/25/2021,stocks,"This forum and many of the others here are full of new traders who have decided to start trading during a extremely bull market. There is nothing wrong with that, but it gives a sense of stocks only go up. The truth is they go up and they go down. For some of us we make money both directions. (Or lose money both directions depending on skill level.) I have my accounts split up for type and risk. Long term accounts that are well diversified and have very few plays are down a few percentage points. My short term/day trading account has positions down a lot (tech for example as well as some penny plays) and other areas that are up. If you trade on margin like I do it's more about defending the core value and keeping your head above water with sure trend plays through this time. For new people out there please be careful with margin! But if you are not in margin and don't want to lose your initial amounts, as long as the company is sound after you do your DD then hold. It's hard to see red, but we all have those days/weeks/years. Trust me, after you see one of these and get caught too heavy in one sector you get better and can make better plays the next time around. Having traded through the 2008 debacle - this is nothing friends. Keep your head up and don't do anything without REALLY thinking it through. Panic selling is how you lose money."
03/25/2021,stocks,Why panic though? There's no point. I get being impatient because I'm super impatient but panicking is dumb.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I don't bother listening long to the analysts any longer. Their DD is intentionally scant...they don't dive into it like we need to know to safely advance our positions. They are there to feed us info to keep investing (I didn't say winning) and then our $$$ gets filtered to the hedgies and eventually the 1%ers. Fuck that forever. I get better analysis and deep diving DD THAT I CAN'T GET ANYWHERE ELSE ANYMORE by scouring reddit boards, Telegram and Discord. Now my portfolio is exploding. HODL, apes and ape queens. This is ours if we hold our ground."
03/25/2021,stocks,A lot of market speculation is just noise and listening to every bit of it will leave you making impulsive decisions that are going to cost you.
03/25/2021,stocks,"These forums are filled with people who started investing in one of the quickest bull market recoveries on record. A damn monkey throwing darts at a board could of made money.

Diversification and a strong core portfolio is key. Once you have that go fuck around"

03/25/2021,stocks,Advice? Hold...let someone you trust change your password and don’t let them give it to you for 2 months.
03/25/2021,stocks,First off analyst generally aren't that clueless. They just have to push a certain narrative OR ELSE basically. Cramer is just a mad lad who likes to be over the top thats how he gets his views kinda like Steven A. Smith does for sports. As far as the market goes though I just think its a big overreaction. For good reason though if we go back through 2020 it wasn't exactly a regular market so people are expecting dot com bubble levels. Thats just what it looks like judging online sentiment anyway.
03/25/2021,stocks,The guys on tv are in it to make themselves and their cronies rich. They don’t care about normal people.
03/25/2021,stocks,Panic selling seems like a rite of passage? Idk I have done it so many times that seeing red doesn’t even phase me anymore. I have sold so many times literally the day before everything skyrocketed. For example the old me would have panic sold yesterday and regretted it today. You have to think why? Did the fundamentals change with your company? If not then just hold it’ll get back.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I rebalanced my portfolios during these back-to-back corrections. Cut back on my more speculative riskier plays mainly SPACs. I also sold off some of my value stocks to double down on semiconductor and EV stocks, and Apple."

03/25/2021,stocks,"I have asked this question to many people with no response. 

Can you explain this seemingly conflicting advice?

1. Set a stop, save a life. (Stop out of a position at about an 8% loss because your hypothesis has been proven wrong.)

2. Corrections happen and they’ll come back. Walk away and only look at it every few months or so. 20% down only matter if you sell out of your position. Ride it out. Selling low is for amateurs."
03/25/2021,stocks,"What correction? Like seriously... do you mean the 1-2% its dropped in the last couple of weeks?

I'm confused"
03/25/2021,stocks,We’re in a correction? That’s news to me. S&P is very close to all time high...?
03/25/2021,stocks,"I love when the market closes down 2% and CNBC runs ""MARKETS IN TURMOIL""   

Well since you asked, I started trading in 2005 and all I can tell you is don't quit.  You'll make mistakes, and the market will evolve.  Just pay attention to the macro situation and what markets are reacting to.  Over time, you'll notice that the market has changed in how long it remembers whatever the current 'crisis' is.  Rising yields were supposed to be the end for stocks but market's don't really care anymore.  Same story with China trade deal, same story with NK and their missiles, and fiscal cliffs, and oil surplus, and every other crisis etc etc..  Markets move on and you gotta pay attention.  It's easy to get sucked into a wormhole of focusing on a very specific issue."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Just an FYI ... This is not a correction lol

G'luck to all."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I like watching/listening to CNBC all day while working at home, but you have to understand that it’s all opinion and entertainment with a side of facts. Don’t take it too seriously or get stressed. When I first started watching last year during the COVID dip, I thought the dramatic music during their shows was due to the crazy market, but no matter if it’s a good or bad day, they have the same dramatic music and bull and bear graphics ready to go. They are in the business of dramatizing the stock market just like news networks dramatize politics and sports networks dramatize sports.

If you’re investing for the long term, especially retirement, just keep contributing every pay and extra when there are dips and you’ll be fine. That is, if you’re investing in common sense stuff like total market index funds and not garbage like GME."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm old enough to be around the [dot.com](https://dot.com/) boom, and if I remember correctly, it wasn't a sudden Peter North explosion where all stocks quickly accelerated downhill. It was more like getting shot in the gut, a slow dying and quite painful death. People bought on the dips, but it kept dipping and dipping until many of those companies went bankrupt or had their stocks lose 80-95% of their value. Some of Wall Street's most beloved stocks have never to this day recovered (Cisco), or took years to recover.

CNBC and its analysts had buys on almost all the hot .com stocks, Henry Blodget and Maria Bartaromo were legends in the making. I don't know if the same thing will happen again, the euphoria isn't nearly as high as it was, but I'm sure there will be at least a little baby bear market that will snuff some of the weaker companies out of existence.

Not long after the [dot.com](https://dot.com/) burst, along came Chris Moneymaker and the poker boom. Online poker burst on to the scene and it wasn't too hard to make decent money if you played a simple TAG style, that is until the US government stepped in and pretty much shut it down to the point where the casual player (fish) stopped depositing money."

03/25/2021,stocks,"I was in the mid 90s big Dow drop, the 2000 dot-com blowup, and the 2008-09 financial recession, along with a bunch of less dramatic but scary reversals. In the 90s I sold out at lowest valuations. After that I learned that the market is meant to be volatile. It’s the nature of the beast. I learned that the long term direction of the US economy, and thus, stock values was up. So, I developed nerves of steel, or at least high grade aluminium, and held my positions or even added at bargain prices."
03/25/2021,stocks,Literally do the inverse of what Cramer recommends. He is a Wall St. shill and he knows exactly what he is doing.

03/25/2021,stocks,Not financial advice but a big drop gives you a chance to harvest tax losses and then dump the cash from selling into your higher conviction stocks (or ETFs following the same index). My understanding is this helps you out come tax time.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Everyone is a genius in a bull market!

I’m a dinosaur who was heavily invested in 2008. That sucked. I was down over $100k this time last year. That sucked too.

My advice to all the n00bs? Don’t panic. Do you still believe in the security (be it the company, the currency, the fund)? If so, your best bet is to hold on. Then when things stabilize a bit take a really hard look at your asset allocation. 

Maybe your risk tolerance isn’t as high as you originally though. That’s okay! We learn and grow and change and can change our investing strategies in reaction to new learnings. This is a great chance for everyone to evaluate their risk tolerance 

- it’s only a loss if you sell

- don’t invest more than you can afford to lose 

- set goals for yourself. Why are you investing? Saving for retirement in 20 years vs trying to turn a quick profit for your tendie-lambo are two very different goals with different strategies. Know what your objective is

- diversify when appropriate. Not just within a sector. But look into low cost mutual/index funds (S&P 500, international, US bond market, small/Med/large cap growth or dividend, corporate bonds). I have most of my investments diversified that way and hold about 10% in individual securities.

- breath and take a drink of water

03/25/2021,stocks,">Average trader with a balanced portfolio is probably down 5%

Balanced *investors* are doing fine. The big index funds are all very green YTD. A balanced long-term portfolio should feel fine right about now. Probably green on every chart maybe except 1M.

*Traders* however are probably suffering right now because of the shift out of tech (which im assuming reddit traders are heavily into), combined with the fact that nothing is making any sense to the average retail trader. The stock market is notoriously impossible to predict but right now it feels like Jesus could come down from heaven and personally bless AAPL headquarters and the price would plummet, only for it to recover if they announce historic losses the day after.

Edit: VTI is currently UP 13% from its peak BEFORE the covid crash. If anyone thinks this is a correction they are in la la land."
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m up 2% from the beginning of the year. I expect that will probably go negative but I don’t expect my long term gains to go red. If it does oh well. I’m just going to sit back and ride the wave and read about people panicking while I take a poop break. As I’m doing right now.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Sometimes, stocks go down."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm up about 40% on positions I picked up just a few months ago. Main reason is that I don't buy stuff after they've pumped. I buy things that are dumped and look like sellers are exhausted.

03/25/2021,stocks,"I don’t mind being down 20% (which was on the nose accurate!) but in 2 days is annoying, especially when everyone just got a large stimulus check and we are at the cusp of returning to normal pre-pandemic.  I don’t mind unpredictability and swings, but the magnitude and reasons really don’t make that much sense.  It’s like we’re trying to predict what other people who are trying to predict other people’s predictions are trying to predict.  It’s incepted too deep.  I feel like it’s heavy investors dumping everything, trying to force panic and stop limits, and picking it back up on the tip of the dip."

03/25/2021,stocks,Tech isn't going away.  It will still lead the market over a longer time horizon.

Valuation is a made up number to make 'serious investors' feel good. Algos control the market, not valuations"
03/25/2021,stocks,Im guilty of this. I started out with 2/3 index fund portfolio. Then I couldn't resist the tempt that I was missing out a lot and invested more into tech. If I sticked with the index fund I would be just flat for the month. Now I don't even want to look at my stocks.

I can tolerate the volatility and am not impulsive, but I’m definitely heavy into tech. I don’t really want to sell while it’s down to diversify to safer bets..... and if waiting it out is the answer then I’m fine with that. Just not sure what my short term moves should be."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I got fucked by coins and 2018 stocks crash, I bought the top in the same month as stocks crashed by like 20% and waited a year to see green, this is why people ask all the time if this is the top and hesitate to invest, I felt like a total failure that year when of all the years of pumping I got in exactly the month the big crash happened, the best time to invest is now until it's not."

If you want to gamble in the stock market go right ahead, there's a decent chance you can actually make some money...but you need to know you are gambling and not investing...you don't see people crying how it isn't fair in Vegas when losing it on red"

03/25/2021,stocks,"While I agree this correction is being blown out of proportion because of the bond yields and general sentiment on the street, I disagree that it’s younger first time traders who are the ones panicking. Most of the negative/bearish sentiment I am seeing online is (what sounds like) older “wiser” investors bashing the “overvalued” tech stocks because the P/E ratios don’t make sense to them. You can go look at yahoo finance right now and you’ll see bears calling it the end of days for stocks like $CRWD or $FVRR. Not that I don’t think younger people aren’t reacting to this dip either but many of us have seen way worse on some “other” Reddit pages LOL. 

Personally, I’m coming up on 1 year in the market. I’ve learned a lot, this has been a really fun 11ish months and I couldn’t imagine putting my money anywhere else even though I’ve taken a beating this month.

So yeah, that's what seems to be happening."

03/25/2021,stocks,I somehow landed at 12.5%

03/25/2021,stocks,"Ignoring valuation tends to hurt more in the short-term as well. If a company is over-valued by 100% and grows 500% over the next 10 years (and already has a track record of YoY that indicates that could happen), I don't really care that I 'bought high'. I'm probably going to see a lot of volatility, but long-holds can diminish the importance of an over-bought stock.

That said, if something is overvalued, it probably pays to wait until some of that volatility puts you in a better buying position."

About half of my first buys were meme stocks. I didn't buy GME because it just happened to spike back up the day before my funds cleared. About a month ago I was down $50 on a $300 account. Now I'm up %5 on the day with a $600 account. Weekly I'm usually up around 0.4-0.7% since I started picking stocks and paper trading with them for about a month until I feel like it's worth investing or trading

I also highly recommend benzinga pro"

03/25/2021,stocks,"Yep. This little correction and turbulence is NOTHING. I’ve been investing for twenty years and the only thing you can say with certainty about the market is that it will very regularly confound your expectations for no discernible logical reason. 

These days intraday volatility is mostly just HFT algorithms trying to outsmart each other at the millisecond level all day long. Also these days the game is more rigged than ever against retail investors by market makers who use order flow info to front run and intentionally punish small investor expectations. 

Imo the best strategy is to take 90% of your portfolio and divide it among ETFs tracking large cap, small cap, and international stocks along with REITs (maybe something like a 40/30/20/10 percent ratio) and rebalance perhaps once or twice a year. 

Take the other 10% and gamble with meme stock options or whatever. Definitely not more than you’re willing to lose."

03/25/2021,stocks,I came here to say this. My index portfolio hasn’t changed that much. I think most of the people calling this a “correction” are the ones who bought overpriced tech stocks at all time highs thinking the prices would continue to grow exponentially forever. And tbh the ones buying into those stocks and now panicking are probably very new at this.

03/25/2021,stocks,"> Do you think they are worth more than they are valued at now?

It's literally an entire university degree in valuing companies. Telling an average retail investor to be well-versed in FMV analysis and apply it correctly to dozens of stocks is ridiculous.

Better advice would be: ""Do you know how to evaluate a company given its industry, fundamentals and financials, investor sentiment, leadership, etc? If not, you shouldn't be investing in equity shares if you are afraid of unrealized losses."""
03/25/2021,stocks,Well the stocks that I have focus on EV and alt energy. I have some ETFs for diversity . The EV sector is growing but in terms of value the stocks could be overvalued but it depends kn who you ask. Today the analysts say ‘yes they are overvalued’... two weeks ago ... ‘buy the dip in these solar stocks/ETFs’ so you know... who knows. I believe long term these stocks should do well.

Slowly investing is a good idea. I’ve seen a bunch of times on here where people ask for investing advice and the solid way to go is to invest a chunk of your money and hold a chunk for a later date to invest, that way you won’t invest everything and the market just tanks -10% or something drastic (regardless if you’re in the long term then it only hurts in the short term!)

You can also always save money to DCA or lump sump invest in the future to hedge your positions or stack them even higher. Still seeing as you’re young, I wouldn’t invest everything you have, as the other saying goes: only invest what you’re willing to lose.

At the end of the day it’s your money and your choice :)"

03/25/2021,stocks,I’d go even broader than that. You want to have diversification into the entire market. VTI or SPY or some other broad market ETF should serve you well for the next several decades.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's an opinionated topic, but sensibility is typically correlated to how long you plan on holding.  Eg, are you buying looking to make money and sell in a year, or are you buying looking to pull out when you're ready to retire decades from now?  If you're investing for decades, would you go with INRG?  So, it's not is it sensible, it's how sensible is it.

People who dollar cost average (invest every paycheck) and don't sell start taking out until retirement have the highest probability of success.  It's not necessarily better to do it this way, but you will make more in the long run if you can do that.  17 is quite young so you may not be in this position yet until you step into a career, and that's okay.  It can be fun to play with the market in the meantime.

This is fun to play with https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html and it will show you how easy it is to make a million by the time you'll really want to use it.  It also makes it easy to calculate for early retirement, if you don't want to work for 30+ years."

And when the next market crash comes, do not be afraid but double down on the stocks you love. Over decades you will be in great shape. The worst investing mistake I have ever made was not investing in my 401k very much during the crash in 2008/2009 due to stretched finances."
03/25/2021,stocks,I think you have to buy the dip
03/25/2021,stocks,More bailouts with no repercussions? And the rich get richer as they buy everything cheaply.
03/25/2021,stocks,"And the overall market is down only 3.8% from the all time high.  If you are selling at a loss, it may be time to rethink your strategy."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I lost quite a bit, and I am sure others did too"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Exactly because it has grown so much people are freaking out tbh, everyone thinks we are in an overpriced market.

A correction is definitely coming at us ready to smack our asses and souls out of our bodies... but we can't time it, it might not even be this year for all we know, so it's probably better to keep investing as usual."
03/25/2021,stocks,"People see the markets are moving and are over adjusting, imo"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Whales and institutions made bets on how they thought the recovery would go months ago at the height of the pandemic, retail buyers followed the whales and institutions. 

Now we are in the phase where governments are starting to give out indicators of how well the recovery is looking from this point right now, and the whales and institutions are readjusting their investments to better position themselves for where they think the recovery is going with this new information coming out. 

Little guys in retail see big moves out of our favorite plays, panic and sell their positions, causing a chain reaction. Hedge funds and other institutions see this pattern and learn how to exploit it by training their high frequency software to recognize similar positions and short those assets to make a profit. It's an ongoing cycle and will continue at least until a more stable outlook on the recovery is in sight.

&#x200B;

Those are my thoughts, and I'm nowhere close to an expert, just wanted to see what others had to say about it.."
03/25/2021,stocks,You need to realize that the number one force for or against any stock is the overall market.  It is very difficult for a stock to swim upstream.  A rising tide lifts all boats and lowers them as well.
03/25/2021,stocks,Just look at the last year. How do you not see a need for a correction?
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think some correction makes sense. The market shot up while the economy went down. However, WSB and GME bois have a theory that it’s massive hedge funds clearing out their long positions in order to cover the shorts."
03/25/2021,stocks,I think money is emotional ...
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks for all the great advice and comments. It’s all about learning. Getting better, taking calculated risk."
03/25/2021,stocks,"So true, losses hurt more than gains feel good. Classic behavioral finance."
03/25/2021,stocks,"New administration isn’t helping. They are repeating all the mistakes of the previous administration, only worse. Which is what each of the last three administrations have done. 

Yellen being head of Treasury is the kiss of death. Fed 100% politicized through that connection. Get ready for stagflation."
03/25/2021,stocks,I continue buying PLTR. I do not predict where the bottom is. If you do believe in the company and its fundamentals have not changed. Then every dip is your opportunity. No pain no gain. Look at the bigger picture. If you do not need this money in the near future then buying the dip should be your number 1 choice. Do not try to predict the price you will always be wrong. It is essential to stay calm in this situation and do not let the market affect your investment principal.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Imo, if you're not buying PLTR now, then when will you?   I'm already all in on it, and it's right around this cost basis.  I feel if Cathie's happy with a cost basis around $24, then I sure as heck am with $22.  (I like the stock independently of her for the record, but surely her team has done plenty of price target analysis for it.)"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I would wait a bit more on both. Check the political situation in China and the regulatory push of the government there plus the plans of the SEC regarding Chinese companies listed in the US. On Palantir, be sure that institutional traders will push it down as much as the market can bear before relenting."
03/25/2021,stocks,">PLTR

its because its overpriced. A good valuation company shouldn't fall that hard during a minor dip, but the overpriced companies always have explosive growth, and wouldnt you know explosive downturns."
03/25/2021,stocks,Just wait till your portfolio gets big enough to where it’s swinging thousands and you just close the app and shake your head.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Is it though? This is strange moment and I think it’s more complex than that. 

Opening up is happening across country with more vaccines. Less unemployment than expected in numbers.

Certain stocks are trading at crazy multiples that seem out of touch with profits.

Correction is drop of 10% for the whole market, even with a big drop today doesn’t seem to be happening, although certain sector s are there.

The fed. Ugh, markets drop when they say they will keep supports and the market drops when they say we might not need as much support.... 

It’s March historically rocky for the markets.

If it was just inflation we would see non elastic sectors growing and we are not.

Then there is the Suez Canal with global shipping already stretched.

In other words a new situation that needs to be analyzed to find value."
03/25/2021,stocks,You really should consider this is also a fear of raised taxes. The market is likely starting to price in how to pay for trillions and trillions of spending.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It is a correction, isn't it? At one point, since NASDAQ's ath in Feb 14th, it nearly fell 12%. That's well in to a correction territory.

Bear in mind, that some stellar companies like AAPL dropped from 145 to 12x (I don't wanna look) after one of the best historic earnings."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Word. S&P 500 isn’t even down 2%. Looks more like rebalancing and diversifying, with a little profit taking thrown in, than an actual market correction."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm not trying to be rude. I'm concerned one of yall will Yolo everything and kill yourself. 

I'm scared of heights. I'd never sky dive or I'd have a heart attack. Same logic. Be safe yall."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Well the Nasdaq at least has dropped 10% from ATH and some sectors in it more, so I think at least for that index it’s a correction. sub 10k would be a 40% drop which would
mean a crash?"
03/25/2021,stocks,As of March 16th (or around there) it was officially designated a correction fyi
03/25/2021,stocks,That is literally what happens in a correction...
03/25/2021,stocks,"That’s what happens in a correction. I think you meant to use the word rotation. Rotations would show strength in some indexes and weakness in others. And if this is a correction, we’re still at the beginning because we aren’t very far off the ATHs still"
03/25/2021,stocks,"It is a correction, isn't it? At one point, since NASDAQ's ath in Feb 14th, it nearly fell 12%. That's well in to a correction territory.

03/25/2021,stocks,That’s the DOW but the Nasdaq can crash / correct and it is still considered a correction ...
03/25/2021,stocks,There are plenty of companies that are profitable - they just are not the Reddit favorites

03/25/2021,stocks,""" Also market is flush with cash, because hey were else are people going to put money to invest with interest rates in the crapper. ""

Just as an aside, not sure about you, but it's easier for me here as I live in a small town USA that is only about 40 mins away from a relatively larger city, but we've noticed that restaurants have been doing really well since getting the stimulus checks.  I mean, to the tune of from about $5000 per week revenue to $4000/day revenue and this is only an anecdotal from a single restaurant owner, but we can see the parking lots in many many restaurants (and there are waay too many here in such small square footage if you asked me), despite covid.  

You'd think covid is a thing of the past!  Stupid people.

Any way, I'm looking at restaurant stocks like Wendy's, McDonald's as those numbers I'm sure will be reflected in the next quarter's reporting earnings."
03/25/2021,stocks,I did not mean it that way. And I am new. Just recently started a job where I have enough savings to put into the market.
03/25/2021,stocks,Well for me I had a 20% drop in my profile. Yes I own a lot of speculative stuff like EV and Solar and Alt energy
03/25/2021,stocks,I thought he is legit
03/25/2021,stocks,">in the last 1 year it's up 60%

If anyone's portfolio is less than 50% gains since mid march 2020 they've got a serious problem."
03/25/2021,stocks,What in tarnations is it then?
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think a lot of people , including me, bough some overvalued sectors , like EV , solar. Maybe SPACs ( I did not get on those) and lost a lot more. Look at TAN it dropped close to 40% from ATH. I got it at around 94$ last Dec, and in my mind, solar, it’s the future, I will invest. I did my research as best as I though was correct. Reading CNBC, Monetley, and SeekingAlpha, at the time, all of them were saying, invest, invest and invest. Same with Lithium stocks... so yeh maybe the market itself is not bad, but some sectors took a big hit... and a lot of newbies like myself got in the mix, so some of us are down a lot:/"
03/25/2021,stocks,There’s an exit?
03/25/2021,stocks,Nasdaq did fall 10% but March 8 I think ... the Dow is doing well
03/25/2021,stocks,"... Hey, do any of you know this guy???"
03/25/2021,stocks,Must be a GME/Wall Street Bets/ roaring kitty fan who stumbled over here....
03/25/2021,stocks,He's not wrong though. Most people on these forums are people that only joined because of the hype.
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm down exactly 20%  🤣
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you're deep in growth stocks, you can probably just weather this. A lot of growth companies are getting clobbered right now, but that has to do with market conditions more than the companies themselves. That's a good sign that they'll rally hard when market conditions change and the Big Boys start throwing more money into growth as well. If anything, it's a good time to double-down on tech."
03/25/2021,stocks,You guys have positions?
03/25/2021,stocks,Samesies except I'm only down about 10%. winning!
03/25/2021,stocks,This
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah but he also described Cathie Woods position
03/25/2021,stocks,"There’s nothing wrong with having the majority of your money in tech. My portfolio is almost solely tech, just hold on to you initial DD and beliefs. 

The problem is panicking and selling when you shouldn’t."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes.  Start to get a few boring stocks.  My most recent buy was Kellogg’s a few weeks ago.  Doesn’t get much more boring then that, but should be a decent gainer and pays 3.7% dividend.  

It’s near a 5 year low, despite the pandemic being good for them as people are eating breakfast at home more often.  Sales are up and Kellogg’s is using the extra money earned during the pandemic to pay down debt.  Boring, but good business.  

The only slightly exciting thing is Kellogg’s also owns the “Morningstar” brand, which is widely available and sells veggie burgers and veggie “meat” and such and could be a big competitor to beyond burger/impossible burger if those end up taking off."
03/25/2021,stocks,"This isn’t true. I’m down 2.6% but  found all of my stocks from Reddit. The thing is, don’t just buy once you see it on Reddit! Research more and then decide. Without Reddit I wouldn’t have such a diverse portfolio and wouldn’t think to look at some of the stocks I own."
03/25/2021,stocks,We're literally 4 trading days away from 3M = YTD. Wtf did you do at the end of December last year?
03/25/2021,stocks,Tesla is a meme stock FYI.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You're so diversified you included assets that moved much more than the broader market.

All the indexes I just looked at are down <10% from their 2021 highs. Of course none of them were down YTD."
03/25/2021,stocks,What positions?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Right?

It's rebounding today, but my financials ETF took a big hit this past week. 

It's not just tech that's taking a hit."
03/25/2021,stocks,"i have only four stocks in my portolio worth Rs, 12 lakh. still 40% up"
03/25/2021,stocks,"EXACTLY. 

This is the correct way to think. Everyone else saying I told you so is having a very, very brief moment in the sun until their boomer stocks return to their annual underperformance."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Tech tilts to growth which over the long-term actually underperforms the market (value outperforms).

03/25/2021,stocks,"The EV industry won’t even mature for another 10-15 years, but yes if I were older I’d probably rethink some tech stocks. With that said I do have a healthy 401k and IRA so anything on the apps is basically money I can yolo."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yup, I’ve been investing for 10 years. I don’t even wince when I’m down 50%. I have no intentions to touch most of my funds for at least 30 more years so when any down turns happen I consider them sales."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not to point out the obvious, but it's been missing from some of the comments about tech on this thread, and would apply to other sectors as well: it depends on which tech stocks you pick. 

I know, this is super obvious. But there are a lot of immature posters on Reddit who are throwing their money at seemingly anything in the tech sector and at any price.

There will be some big time winners in the tech sub sectors, no doubt. But there will be many more losers. Some people are holding stocks that are going to turn into irrecoverable losses and they're bragging about how rich those stocks will make them in the future."
03/25/2021,stocks,But sometimes they only go up
03/25/2021,stocks,What are your indicators for exhaustion but growth?
03/25/2021,stocks,How can that be when obscure PennyStocks also take a hit? I can’t imagine that big money wastes time with these.
03/25/2021,stocks,"My high risk side is a dumpster fire right now but I have been setting aside gains into my boring side which is holding up pretty well.  Am down probably 35% from late Feb, but still up about 80-90% from start of January."
03/25/2021,stocks,You probably bought in before January of this year though. Spy isn't far off its ath so if you bought at any time other than the last two or three months you'd be up.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m in a similar boat. I have some higher risk investments that haven’t even changed that much. It’s just been kind of “meh” the last month. There have been entire down years in the semi-recent past, this is nothing (yet!)"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Seeing all the panic and people saying they are down 20%+ makes me feel like a total pro being down only 1.6% on the week, and up big from every other time frame (after somehow recovering from a devastating 10% total loss in late Feb. from a braindead decision.)

I'll be massively reducing my trading of individual stocks for the foreseeable future, because I know I'll mess it up now that the market is getting so wonky. But since I'm still a degenerate gambler I am swing trading with SPY options instead."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah same, my portfolio is just a bunch of broad market etfs and I am so confused how people are freaking out. Even if you look at growth etfs, they are still within a few percent of flat over the past three months. 

Almost like bot accounts are trying to hype up a sell off or something."
03/25/2021,stocks,Sheesh... Have you thought about bringing some excitement back into your life ?
03/25/2021,stocks,True but the tech stocks of today may not be the ones still around or winning in 5 years.
03/25/2021,stocks," Yeah, not worried about my lithium stocks. Prices are still growing and need is still growing and shortage is inside 5 years."
03/25/2021,stocks,Tell that to the boomers who lost boatloads during the .com crash.
03/25/2021,stocks,Who were your biggest gainers? And what got you into them?
03/25/2021,stocks,how?
03/25/2021,stocks,"This depends. What tech stocks are you holding? If they're large and established companies that are in good shape, then don't worry about the stock price. Hold.

If you have reason to believe the stock won't recover, or that the circumstances of the company have changed for the worse, consider selling to limit losses. 

If you yolo'd on speculative nonsense, then cut bait and chalk up the losses to a good learning opportunity. Moving forward, invest in companies you have done thorough DD on, so you know how to react during a market downturn. 

If you yolo and the stock increases, cool. But if it goes from $10 to $6, if you don't really understand the company and its circumstances, you won't know whether to hold or sell. DD isn't just to make an informed purchase, it's also to set you up to make an informed hold or exit as well."
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you want to start doubting yourself, watch the talking heads."
03/25/2021,stocks,Read newspapers. Not just the financial pages... Front to back.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yahoo Finance is incredible.
03/25/2021,stocks,I sold my house and added a 4th position in GME to my portfolio did I do it right?
03/25/2021,stocks,"This is honestly not a great way to view the market. 

Obviously ""buy low"" is generally fine advice, if extremely broad, but treating downtrends in the market like it's a ""discount"" is just fundamentally flawed thinking.

Even if some folks know to read between the lines in a statement like that, far more don't - or worse, they think they know - and it leads people to make some very bad decisions."
03/25/2021,stocks,If only I had a secure job to keep doing that...
03/25/2021,stocks,Dollar cost average
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’ve been investing for 20 years and just learned about this 2 days ago. Wish I would have known!

Basically just means “continue to buy at predetermined intervals.” So instead of spending $1000 today on a stock, maybe spend $100 a month on that stock. This way if the stock starts at 50 and then goes down to 25 by month 6 and then back up to 50 at the end of the year you will have made money, whereas if you just went all in at 50, you would not have made anything after 12 months. 

The risk is that if the stock continues to go up over 12 months you will not have made as much money as you could have."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The ""buy more while on sale"""
03/25/2021,stocks,"> Not a correction to get the gains of DCA. 

I think you misunderstand DCA. The entire point of DCA is that you invest on the way up and the way down because you can't time the market. You don't just decide to stop doing DCA and start trying to timing the market... that is the opposite of DCA and is a losing strategy."
03/25/2021,stocks,"ICLN

I can't wait for the rebalancing"
03/25/2021,stocks,ARK crashed a lot at the beginning of the red days and now it's just running sideways so that really just depends when you bought.
03/25/2021,stocks,This
03/25/2021,stocks,I feel personally attacked.
03/25/2021,stocks,Don't forget BMBL
03/25/2021,stocks,To be fair they were said to be highly overvalued for a year or more and then all of a sudden the sentiment changed to “they’re going to keep going up”.  Not to mention some stocks like PLTR are probably undervalued and still are down.  Basically if you just listen to popular sentiment then nobody knows what the hell they’re taking about.
03/25/2021,stocks,The S&P dipped 10% in late feb-early march. Its rebounded nicely since but that the definition of a correction
03/25/2021,stocks,"Problem is AAPL has been right where it is since last August, trading sideways with a few hills around quarterly reporting time. People buying the news around end of Jan think it's a crash / correction because they heard AAPL had record reportings and bought when that was already priced in, then others took their gains and cashed out."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The people losing their jobs were, for the most part, not people who had substantial 401(k)s to begin with."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Correction, by definition is a 10% drop from all time high. Currently, none of the index are in correction. Markets fall in many ways. Sometimes there is a big news like covid, other times it runs sideways for a while and then decline slowly (which might be happening right now) and sometimes earnings drop and it triggers a sell off.

I expect earnings for some of the big companies to be underwhelming by Q4 as the economy opens up and people are not relying so much on online shopping. When big boys miss estimates, the market suddenly remembers that PE ratio is still a thing and they try to take profits. Algos are written to sell baskets of stocks to book profits/stop loss which further lead to declines.

Current market behavior is not bad at all. Things turn around when you enter actual correction and it gets really interesting in a bear market (over 20% drop). You want some cash for when that happens and I would highly recommend people to not use margin after the market has had a historic run, and then get caught up a bear market without any cash or ability to average down. I expect something like this to happen around October-December timeframe but it can be sooner.

Obviously no one can predict anything, it's just my speculation. I got caught up overleveraged in 2018 meltdown and have learned my lesson. A lot of the people are learning it now. There is no such thing as too high or too low. Look at tech, solar and semiconductor stocks. Many have fallen big recently but they are still a LOT up from 2019 (I dont look at March 2020 prices because that was an anomaly). Hope this helps.

TLDR: stonks no always go up"
03/25/2021,stocks,"S&P is only about 3% off its all time high. I’m sure it will be lower at some point in the future, but (1) no one knows when, and (2) this is in no way a “big drop.”"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I hear what your saying, but people can still attempt to value stocks without a degree. Doesn’t mean you’ll be correct, ppl with degrees are wrong all the time. But in a growth sector like EV’s I think people can read earnings calls, decide whether they feel the business is doing well and make a prediction about the future."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Analysts change their minds every time new info comes out. So it might be overvalued today, but if Tesla has good news tomorrow it might be a buy. If you believe in alt energy and EV’s and the companies you are in are stable, you have to believe the price will go up. I’m a big believer in cannabis legalization. So even though some of my stocks are down (for the year) I believe legalization will come, and shoot them up. Til then, I don’t care what the price does."
03/25/2021,stocks,15-17 with a heavy euro based portfolio and a costly broker eating those few % of profits.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Time in the market beats timing the market. And this is why I mentioned dca in the position. Every month, taking emotions out of investing. 
I’m not talking about single picks, I’m talking about the overall portfolio.
Running after what other are doing means running after momentum stock, which may or may not be a good strategy"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm curious, what were you holding during that time?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Well take it off your wishlist and put it in your cart. There are a lot of good investing books out there to learn how to how to invest safely *and* well. One Up is a great one to start with, but it's not going to help sitting on your wishlist."
03/25/2021,stocks,"GME was my expensive learning opportunity. Learning usually comes at a cost, as we don’t learn as well from our success compared to our failures."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Agreed. I don’t consider us in a correction, but a lot of newer investors seem to only be exposed to the nasdaq or overvalued meme stocks. They are definitely experiencing a correction to their stocks values."

03/25/2021,stocks,Besides the Arks as I’ve dca’d my way down to -15%  hahah  BTFD has become the theme of 2021.
03/25/2021,stocks,Thanks for the advice! I’ll look into them some more

I’m looking to mainly invest long term for several decades, so this could be useful. I appreciate it."
03/25/2021,stocks,I mean it's not like you couldn't have bought cheap stocks either back in 08. They're just smarter.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I just read OP is following what Cramer says on TV...

These people are screwed either way."
03/25/2021,stocks,I’ve gotten hammered in my day trading accounts. My long term retirement accounts (index ETFs) have been down a little bit but nothing major.
03/25/2021,stocks,"The pandemic rebound went outta control. All the ark etfs, plus many other etfs and stocks went up hundreds of %. Do you think it's going to be a long slow bleed or just another crash?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Where is the money flowing though?
03/25/2021,stocks,But not right now. Nothing has changed fundamentally. There is no outside catalyst.
03/25/2021,stocks,shill https://youtu.be/ItR0k_jk2cI AMC but it’s under the same roof as WSB and even GME to an extent.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It seems like everyone has someone to blame though.  It also seems like any suggested policy  helps one group but harms another.  Is there any possible way to even make everyone happy?

I feel like any economic policy is going to piss one group and lose them money.  So I find it difficult to have an opinion on.  I also am undereducated on the subject, too, I admit."
03/25/2021,stocks,That's why I bought PLTR in my RothIRA.  I can't access the money for 20+ years anyway.  No rush to pull out if I am gonna hold for years and won't see any money until retirement.
03/25/2021,stocks,"That's true for most tech companies who's entire valuation depends on the sentiment of how well their current/ future products will do in a future market... Once details about how/what that future market/ economy is going to actually look like, people reassess their investments and readjust to better position themselves in light of the new data. 

This is often done impulsively as that data comes out incrementally and only paints a narrow picture of how that future economy will shape up, but some people/ institutions driven by an inflated sense of their own skills at predicting the future overreact to even the tiniest deviations. If those people and/or institutions are giant players making giant corrective/ reflexive moves into/out of certain positions, all the other little fish in the see are going to react to the massive waves caused by these whales and panic out of those same positions, causing that wave to compound and grow. All the computers used by large institutions to execute thousands of sales and contracts per second also get hit by those waves and pile onto the rapidly turning waters, eventually getting to the point where even the smallest disturbance causes massive overreactions throughout every sector until things finally calm down again.

Who wins? The whales. They shape the market in the image that benefits them the most with one massive sale, or in some cases one tiny tweet. Also, institutions that have caught onto the pattern here and adapted the software they use to exploit the situation as much as possible.

&#x200B;

Who loses? Retail investors, especially people who just joined the market due to the ongoing GME phenomenon and don't understand what's going on, are more easily panicked by seeing double digit negatives in their portfolios and sell at a loss instead of just putting the phone down, playing some *Last of US II* for a few weeks and then jumping back in later when things have stabilized and started to rebound."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Everyone was arguing that valuations don’t matter anymore. That P/E and other ratios don’t accurately assess a company’s worth. That it’s harder to value to tech and other emerging markets. 

Overvalued markets sooner or later return to fair valuations. There is still a lot more to go."
03/25/2021,stocks,You are right. Why are there talks of inflation but why are crypto and precious metals all tanking?

03/25/2021,stocks,"A lot of stocks aren’t Reddit favourite :P

By not profitable, I really do mean taking a look at the financials to see if they are investing the funds for a better future vs simply just misused and mid allocation of resources."
03/25/2021,stocks,"All all good points ... I have not looks at those.   Will check out restaurants.  Problem is allot of stocks that were oversold are back to their prior levels.  Most of the discounts have already been snatched up.  I was holding allot of gold and silver before covid, those did not drop to bad and then spiked, I sold then and switch to blue chips.  I have been playing XOM/BP when they were down and BA and LUV ... to scared of AMC.   Issue with AMC is that movie houses had been on the decline since even before covid.  Covid allowed me to restructure my portfolio to more blue chips (at discount) and nearly all I now own pay dividends to boot.   I am not complaining, I have been more fortunate than most.  I like to remind myself that when I am green and up, that its on the backs of others that have been loosing.  Easy to forget.  But even in my portfolio the swings were 40% both ways during the most bearish period... it is tough when you large red numbers, but I just unplugged for a couple months XOM I actually bought in x2 more 2/3 and 1/3 as it went all the way to 30s ... been there done that with the other market crashes.   If the stock you own can weather a storm it best to chill and wait out the storm.  Bear markets can last a long time too.  I will never tell those new to investing that its easy, its not.  It is incredibly hard to hold winners, even stock that do well can have lots of volatility.  Looking at a historic chart is easy and one easy can say I wish I bought xyz X years ago.   But so easy to forget the highs and lows that go with a stock.  Even on a blue chip, they can move aggressively then people panic and sell ... or worse, they have aggressive stop losses.  Stop losses will murder your portfolio all day long.  Its like allowing the trading house to see the cards you playing with ... they can just decide to introduce volatility and force a bunch of stop losses and cash in the puts then again pump it up again and again make money on the top end with calls ... lulling people back in.  Hence I try stay away from small cap stocks, or fad stocks ... big larger ones dont get moved so easily.  But hey, each to their own."
03/25/2021,stocks,"A quick looks the restaurant industry shows that most are or at or even over the pre covid levels ... so picking any of those will mean pre covid logic applies again.  I ask myself if these stock's really now worth more than what they were worth pre covid?  

There are always bargains around, but no more covid induced bargains.  Back to looking at P/E levels and whatever value investing or method one normally used IMO.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Well you can’t have a high risk, undiversified portfolio and be upset when it takes a hit and call it a total market correction. I respect people that are investing heavily into futuristic companies but you’re talking an enormous risk that you’re so deep into it without diversification that the market dropping 2.5% from all time high has you at a 20% loss"

Yea, that's what he said."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm fairly new but I can already tell that any red day is like groundhog day. I'm going to call BS on the analysis about new investors though. I mostly see seasoned investors trying to predict the future over and over and talk about how they see it coming in hindsight every dip. CNBC does it because we all do it. Everyone wants to feel like they have a handle on something that is largely unpredictable. Predict a million things and you'll eventually be right.
03/25/2021,stocks,And what’s your point? They don’t have the right to invest because they saw some hype going on? This sub is full of salty gatekeepers who think they’re better than everyone else. It’s quite pathetic.

If you’re in the market and can’t tolerate volatility, get out. Buy bonds. If you want to make real money this is what it looks like. You’re either a preservationist of capital or you invest for the long run. You can do both but the returns are often lower. 

Tech is still and has been the space to be in. Nothing has changed. Sentiment has changed. In the short run the market is a voting machine. In the long run it’s a weighing machine.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Honestly, I stepped back from Reddit. I still enjoy browsing the subs, but my previous strategy (see what the professionals are doing, and pick my favorites from among those) was working, and I went back to it.

Honestly, anyone should have seen this correction coming. I was reading about rebalancing portfolios and picking up cyclicals back in November and December. I just couldn't convince myself to switch while the bull run was still going on. My mistake there was assuming I had to pick one way or the other. The smart move would have been to shed a little of my tech week by week while simultaneously picking up value stocks. Had I started in Mid-December when the cycling portfolio news was becoming more prevalent, it would have been perfect timing to ride out the correction with less loss than the NASDAQ. Of course hindsight is 20/20 and all, but lessons were learned... that's for sure."

03/25/2021,stocks,"It depends what you consider tech.  In the early to mid 1800s during the industrial revolution if you invested in the technology at the time, typically not called tech today, then you would have been in a very good position.

In the 1870s, 30s, 60s, and 70s value investing was king.  These were decades when the market was flat so buying broad market wouldn't have made much of anything, so the only way to profit during those time periods were to buy specific companies, and it was during a time when new tech wasn't popping up, so those specific winner companies were value companies like Coca-Cola and the like.

edit: The article linked I'm responding to makes an argument against value investing.  This caught me off guard.  Here is the take-aways at the end of the article:

> Here are 5 take-aways from the extended history:
> 
>1) The -59% value crash as of March 2020 is on the very extreme side of an almost 200 year history. 
> 
>Yet over the long-run, Value crashes of -50% appear ‘normal’. Well, they happened at least four times before the current one, if you count the -49% crash in 1862. 
> 
>2) Without the help of long history, and before the current drawdown, investors might have mistaken value investing as safe. 
> 
>Back in 2006, which is when systematic value investing started to go mainstream, investors could see just one value crash of -54% back in 1932. 
> 
>It was easy to dismiss it as part of a ‘very different history’ that was no longer relevant. Investors made a similar incorrect assumption about Price Momentum before it crashed in 2009. 
> 
>With the help of extended history, the hypothetical 2006 value investor, warned about the periodic crashes, would estimate value’s risk differently, and as a result, would be less hurt during the current drawdown (I think it’s time for Excel to recognize dates before 1900).
> 
>3) 1940 to 2006 was an exceptionally safe period for value investing compared to its full history. And this tailwind helped many great value investors, creating unrealistically high expectations for value investing.
> 
>For example, the Graham-Newman partnership years only saw the lowest value drawdown of -40% in 1939 - just three years after their partnership started. From then on, value rallied with minimal drawdowns during the twenty years that they operated with astonishing 20% per year returns (13% of which could be attributed to the top decile of book to value Fama-French portfolio). 
> 
>Warren Buffett was also a benefactor of the 50-year low-crash-risk period that ended around 2006. He is now navigating the worst value drawdown in his very long investment career. 
> 
>4) Value investing, like any investing, looks like a never-ending series of drawdowns, with tiny intervals of absolute gains in between. 
> 
>For example, out of 2332 months of value’s history, only 266 were not in drawdown - slightly over 10%. And yet when you look at the cumulative return, you barely notice the drawdowns, because the long-term compounding starts to deliver its magic. 
> 
>In the end, I believe all investing comes down to balancing the two outcomes: drawdowns and average returns. And deep history can help us set the right expectations about both."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Well sure. I have a bit in riskier plays but most is in actual shares of larger tech companies.  If we're looking at the whole sector though, QQQ has done much better since it's inception than SPY over the same period."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not OP but I just look at companies I like, check their financials, and come up with a fair price. If it drops 10% below my fair price (I’ll usually wait for a little more) and nothing has changed within the company or the industry (just fear and panic selling) then I’ll scoop. Coming up with a fair price I usually downplay expected growth and try to do everything I can to hurt the company on paper to give myself some safety to protect my principal."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, that’s the difference, I am probably only up 5% since early January?  If that.

Slow and steady baby"
03/25/2021,stocks,"> Spy isn't far off its ath so if you bought at any time other than the last two or three months you'd be up.

That's my problem, and I'm sure many here are in the same boat.  I've been hearing two things predominantly from older investors on Reddit (and elsewhere):

1.  ""Time in the market beats timing the market""

2.  ""That's what you get for investing in overvalued stocks at the peak""

Well fuck me for trying to not time the peak I guess.  I'm just gonna keep holding and hope the first one is true."
03/25/2021,stocks,That’s true of any sector.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Pretty sure tsla, aapl, msft and the likes arent going anywhere anytime soon"
03/25/2021,stocks,That is what people are saying about tech stocks. The sector will perform well but the top dogs will drag down the average and it will underperform compare to the market.
03/25/2021,stocks,that's why personally I buy tech stocks in companies that have been around a lot longer than 5 years (most 10x that)
03/25/2021,stocks,"Disagree. Amazon, Google and Microsoft aren't going away. It'll take years for any anti trust to actually go through and they're effective monopolies in huge sectors. Apple is there too and they have enough cash to weather most storms. 

Companies like Snow, Palatair and others are much more uncertain."
03/25/2021,stocks,"My exposure is limited to LIT.  I expect to see the NDSQ around 10k or less, so I’m not inclined to average down just yet."
03/25/2021,stocks,So this is the dotcom crash? Let’s see in a year from now whether amazon is back at $100.
03/25/2021,stocks,"First off off, thank you for the help - I would say most of mine seem pretty safe. NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, ZM, TDOC all seem to have longevity. I’ve had these all for over a year and am not worried. 

Some of the ones I’m less sure of are like TSLA, NIO, PLTR, and LMND. I’ve taken really big losses on all of those from January and February purchases. 

Then I do have a fair amount of boomer stocks - JNJ, HON, JPM, KO, and some travel - DAL and CCL. 

I guess I’m glad I invested in those, but it’s really that middle tier I’m not sure if I should ditch out on. I guess I’m not sure how to do a DD - there seems to be so much contradictory information out there (half the internet/sources like Seeking Alpha/Motley Fool says PLTR is a buy, half say don’t touch it). 

Your advice is definitely appreciated!"
03/25/2021,stocks,"The recent and ongoing anti retail trader crap they are spewing on the media, along with the blatant lies have confirmed all the above."
03/25/2021,stocks,Kramer was calling for rallies through all three dips of the dotcom bust.
03/25/2021,stocks,Except guys like Cramer used to be smart money. So more like the old NBA guys getting on ESPN to do play by plays.
03/25/2021,stocks,Something that's been said many ways by many different people is basically that what's going to move markets weeks and months from now is the story on page 15 not the front page.
03/25/2021,stocks,Agreed as long as you can ignore the clickbait ads heavily peppered throughout the news section.
03/25/2021,stocks,I say discount to mean I invest in the same places each month as my budget will allow and my stocks of interest aren't going to change based on market fluctuations.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I have a ton of stocks I really like in my portfolio. When they’re down in a correction like this, I buy more of them at a discount because I believe in them long term."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ah yes, the ol' buy high sell low. Good you're advocating it"
03/25/2021,stocks,"This advice. Is to never be taken. You hear every year, decade, 20 years go by. ""I wish I invested in that a (insert year) ago, I would've made (insert profit)."" 

Everything right now compared to the long run is low. Your advice is a terrible outlook on the market. The market has never stopped growing, sure there may be a recession, depression, corrections. But throughout history the market has always increased. 

This is common sense. No one should take his advice. Buy a good company whenever you can if you don't intend on selling"
03/25/2021,stocks,I agree. Every time the market goes down a bit newbies start shouting... Buy the dip! Buy the dip! They're not even understanding why it's dipping and they continue to prop up a sinking ship.
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you DCA all the time anyways, then a discount is in fact correct. I DCA weekly and monthly into ETFs. I rarely look at my account, but whenever the market is down that means a discount to me. I'm still up 7% for the quarter."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Freaking ICLN lol 

My portfolio I was planning to go into was going to be VGT, VTI, ICLN, ARKK & VFIAX

03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah goddamnit. YTD it was a fantastic gainer for me, but when I moved into my ISA, I re-bought 'the dip' but it just kept dipping. The weighting is very heavy on PLUG (which I also re-bought), on which I've also incurred a 30% (!!!) loss.

I can only hope it gains again -- I'm confident it will, even with PLUG still being slightly overvalued -- I think the future is bright for the sector, even with the hype."
03/25/2021,stocks,I watched it from 70 to 140 and I didn't buy it because they were Tesla heavy. Finally just decided to buy it at 138. I know how to time it perfectly. I decided to buy stocks in February last year after market kept climbing.
03/25/2021,stocks,"LOL i bought arkk at like 122 watched it run to its top then sold at like 118 (not as a panic sell, just made the conscious decision to move some of my holdings into different types of assets)"
03/25/2021,stocks,"ARK went up way too much in 2020, i predict it slowly bleeds all 2021. Cathie Woods is overrated"
03/25/2021,stocks,Is that a stock ticker or did you forget to type the rest of your comment?
03/25/2021,stocks,The last time the S&P dipped 10% was 9/2020. March 2021 wasn’t even close to 10%.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yep, that sums up my experience. Bought in three days before earnings"
03/25/2021,stocks,"You are right that no indexes are down 10%. NASDAQ got close at 9.7% and I think that's what's rattling everyone. DOW and S&P are like 2% or 3%, really not a concern...yet."
03/25/2021,stocks,This is why time in the market is more valuable than timing the market. Just keep on investing and carry on as usual
03/25/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/25/2021,stocks,Have fun looking for cash at the bottom.
03/25/2021,stocks,What time?
03/25/2021,stocks,Right. Lots of overvalued stocks are in bear territory correct? I see some down like 30-40 percent from ATH.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Which is totally fine. If both the stock you sold at a loss, and the one you are buying, dropped by an equal amount, selling at a loss and buying the second stock would have been the same if you did it before they dipped. There is nothing wrong with diversifying during a dip."
03/25/2021,stocks,"And probably bought more of the stock which has the highest negative or stocks which went down this day.

That's how you bet your losers will outperform your winners. (which almost never happens)"
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you don’t believe the company in which your money is in will turn around and start to go up, why is selling bad? That money is the same amount of money no matter where you put it in. Just pay the small commission to move it if you think it will be beneficial in the long run. That going green on your position stuff is kind of just a mental thing"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Some think another larger crash is coming like 2008. If you zoom out on the chart, the pandemic was really a V shaped recovery and did not do much to change the trajectory from the longest bull market in history.

I have a feeling that this one will fly higher than anyone could have guessed, due to the collapse in bond market returns. Who knows though, maybe higher interest rates in 2022 will bring it all down."
03/25/2021,stocks,r/Bogleheads is a great resource
03/25/2021,stocks,Make sure you're maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts first though. 401k/Roth IRA
03/25/2021,stocks,"Could be being liquidated and kept aside waiting for a turnaround point... Keeping cash aside and waiting for the dust to settle to see where the best sales and discounts are before jumping back in, but like I said... Im just spit balling like we all are and trying to make sense of all this."
03/25/2021,stocks,No catalyst last September either. Institutions just all decided to take profits at the same time and everything took a nosedive. It is what it is. It's better for your sanity not to try and make sense or find a logical reason to the market movements.
03/25/2021,stocks,"There are though...

After last March's Covid correction, the market boomed due to people making predictions based on what they thought the recovery would like without any solid information. Now, with the recovery in sight, governments are beginning to give clues as to how the recovery is actually shaping up to look like a few months from now, this is causing big players to shift around their investments and strategies to better position themselves to make the most off the recovery.

Little fishes like us in retail see the waves made by these whales shifting these positions and hitting some of our favorite plays particularly hard, so many panic sell to try to follow the big fishes and cut their losses, then short sellers and hedge funds see this pattern unfolding and learn how to train their high-frequency trading computers to exploit it, causing a chain reaction that weighs on just about every asset on the market from Oil, to Tech, to Pharma, even to Crypto. 

I think it's going to stabilize once it gets to a point where too much big-money assets are threatened and the market makers move to calm things down and resume stable growth."

Point is any strategy that is going to outperform over the longterm is going to have points of pain. Growth investing also has points of pain (2000) but without the benefit of longterm outperformance.

03/25/2021,stocks,Value investing works across regions across time. Value outperforms growth historically by a lot.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yep. Many of the tech stocks on the Nasdaq are large, established and stable companies, many of whom will be shifting from the growth category to the (potential-) value category as their growth slows (for whatever this sort of categorization is worth). Apple is an example, in my opinion, of a company that will see the rate of growth slow, and they will likely increase dividends as that happens. 

So it's not tech that's super risky, as I don't see Apple and Amazon as risky investments at a sensible price, but these aren't the hip stock naive investors are tossing their money at, at least not the one's I'd worry about on their behalf."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yep and for me it was a calculated risk.  Absorbing higher levels of risk is awesome for returns but it cuts the opposite way when the market reversed and I think a lot of folks are getting a brutal lesson in this regard.
03/25/2021,stocks,"The first one is true as long as what you're buying is solid. If you're buying overvalued meme shit, then timing the market becomes necessary.

But when it comes to passive investing, or well diversified, well researched active investing, in the long run, the first one is true.

And by long run I mean many years, not a couple months. If you look back at the last 30 years there's a LOT of spots where you could've ""bought the peak"" and been red for months/years. But every index and all quality stocks are up massively overall. And if you had tried to buy every dip and sell every peak there is a 99% chance that your overall returns would be lower than if you just kept buying whenever you had money and holding.

BUT along those years, there is countless stocks that rose to ATH and never came back. People who bought the peak on those never broke even. The dotcom bubble comes to mind, and is what is most similar to the current environment IMO. So many overvalued bullshit companies (the EV space in current years comes to mind), and if you timed them well you could've made huge gains, but if you didn't you were left holding the bag forever.

But now if you look at the quality companies of the time, even tech companies, in the end you come out a winner. Look at MSFT for example. If you bought at the peak of the dotcom bubble, it was 59$. It stayed under there for 16 years. But it's a solid company, and in the long run it ended up outperforming every index over the same period. And normally you would keep buying at regular intervals so you would've broke even much sooner than 2016, and the returns today would be much better.

This ended up very long, but what I'm getting at is both statements can be true from the same perspective. You want to identify solid companies, that you have strong belief will outperform the market for many many years, and you want to continuously buy them regularly, and only sell if your thesis has changed and you don't believe in their future anymore. Buying ""overvalued"" stocks isn't necessarily bad, as long as they're not excessively overvalued, and the company is solid (stocks like aapl and amzn come to mind as fitting that description). But buying EV stocks with 10B$ market cap and no revenue is different, and some amount of timing is required."
03/25/2021,stocks,"both can be true

rebalancing your portfolio to remove the stocks that seem outrageously overvalued is not a bad idea

or buy ETFs that do this automatically (pretty much any factor except market cap weighting will do this)"
03/25/2021,stocks,"While you are right in theory, the risk seens higher in tech than most other sectors.

I would assume that a company like Apple has a higher risk to fall out of favor than Coca Cola or P&G.

I mean look at how Apple rose. Technology sectors are volatile to disruptive innovation. When Smartphones became a thing Nokia died because their product became obsolete. If someone develops a holo communicator or some other new tech to beat the smartphone, Apple might fall or at least lose a big part of their market share. This is also true because the avg lifecycle in tech is compareatively low.

But i hardly see anyone develope a new Softdrink to beat Cola. Even if you assume sugar tax or similar they can use their large infrastructure to adaptbefore most competitors could take advantage.

Same goes for the entire FMCG market. The risk of disruptive innovation is almost non existant."

Apple is still too reliant on iPhones and they have tons of competitors that have similar, or some might argue better products. I get the value added services but they too are only for apple users and the AR/Cars are to be seen. The 2T valuation also makes it far from ideal from an investing standpoint.

Tesla is barely even profitable and is solely a speculative play. Their market cap is more than all other big cars companies combined and their futuristic tech in not necessarily part of the stock. Elon Musk might do separate IPOs for SpaceX/starlink which can hurt the fanboys. Plus, they have major competition and an unjustifiable valuation. This is not comparable to Microsoft or even Apple."

03/25/2021,stocks,"You've made a lot of solid choices. I don't know what you paid for each, but that's not a bad looking portfolio. 

Some people really focus their DD on discounted cashflow analysis. DCA is pretty difficult. Some people will tell you it's simple just grab a template and it's easy, but that's not true. You have to make assumptions and you have to know an awful lot to make good assumptions in your model. One thing you can do is to develop your own quick method for determining the seahawksgirl89 adjusted book value of a share. 

Go to the company's website and find their financials. Find the shareholder equity, divide by the number of outstanding shares, and you have simple book value. Now, you may want to add in expected earnings per share by adding recent EPS to the book value, which gives you present equity plus expected additional equity from the coming year. You may want to add divideds per share to your adjusted book, etc. 

Try this with some companies you hold and see how close that number gets to what the shares are trading for today. The seahawksgirl adjusted book value will likely be lower than the share price for most stocks. But this gives you a bit of an idea of the actual present value (near term value anyway) of the shares. You'll get a feel for how much higher than this number you ought to be willing to pay based on the type of company. For example, a utility company will probably trade closer to this book figure than a growth stock in the tech sector. So it will take some feel, but it's a bit of a place to start anyway. 

But also take at least a glance at all the financial figures. Are revenues increasing? are EBITA and net income increasing? Are their liabilities greater than their assets? Even a simple review of these figures should help to inform we lay-persons. 

As for the individual stocks, I can't offer much help there, but I don't think Tesla is going away anytime soon."

I mean with all due respect, it's naive to think that the government spending since last March [Doesn't compare to anything else in the history of the country as well](https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/spending_chart_1900_2020USp_XXs2li011tcn_F0f_US_Federal_Government_Spending).

&#x200B;

The link above shows data from 1900 up to 2020 on federal spending, and you can clearly see several outsized spikes in spending.

**1915-1922**: WW1 and then Spanish Flu Pandemic

**Mid 1930s-mid** 1940s: 

Great Depression

New Deal- 

1. Massive infrastructure programs
2. Government Jobs program to get people employed
3. Social Safety nets first being established

And then obviously WW2.

**Mid 1950s**: Massive infrastructure program, Interstate Highway Act was passed and our interstates were built, highest marginal tax rate on the top .1% of income was 90%, Economy booming.

**2009-2012:** Great Recession and the bailouts.

and finally, 2020 for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

The pattern is clear, the US government over the last hundred years has had massive spikes in spending several times, and every one of those times was in response to:

1. Global or national crisis like war or disease
2. To address critical needs like improving our commercial networks and infrastructure needed thereof; To quickly respond to growing economic/ social disturbances like pandemic diseases and large scale economic unrest to keep businesses afloat, people employed, people taken care of in times where employment is difficult due to unforeseen circumstances (Like a pandemic or sudden economic crisis)."

03/25/2021,stocks,"That's a great response, thank you.  I think the tricky thing is identifying in the moment which companies will be the next Microsoft and not the next Netscape, especially for newer investors like myself."
03/25/2021,stocks,"When you look at valuation, how do you evaluate companies that are not currently profitable?  In some sectors like biotech, most companies are not profitable for a long time yet many still see large growth in share price.  That invalidates the ability to look at the P/E, for example. 

Also, my biggest portfolio loser is a sector ETF (no, not ARK).  It's done worse than my individual stock picks; I've lost 30% in 2 months."
03/25/2021,stocks,Tech is also one of the most over leveraged sectors. So many companies based simply on future prospects
03/25/2021,stocks,"It seems to me today's big tech winners are soon to be considered ""value"" rather than tech. That is, for example, Apple sits on a ton of cash, it's paying a dividend, it's growth will slow, it's dividend will increase, and people will be looking at the stock differently than the tech ""growth"" stocks usually denoted by ""tech"" in casual conversation."
03/25/2021,stocks,Thinking 20-50 years into the future. I can’t think of a more bullish business. Tesla is waaay ahead of the curve and their looking way out into the future. They have their hands in enough smart sectors w/out diluting their focus that I’m bullish on it long term. Even if they strike gold in one sector they’ll own that corner of the market outright for a long time. I believe the vehicle sector is already a big win for them and will stay that way.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah. Some of those 50 are still *very* profitable and scaled up. I’m still buying DIS. I dont think aapl or mfst are in the same hemisphere as any of those companies and are well within my risk tolerance.
03/25/2021,stocks,Oh so now we’re picking which stocks people own lol.

I’ve held AAPL, AMZN, and NVIDIA for about 3 years so those have been great, and ZMin March 2020 really paid off. LMND is where I realllllly overpaid ($150s). CRSR average at $40 and NIO in the $50s as well. Those will be my first DD and I truly appreciate your tips!!"
03/25/2021,stocks,It has a heavy weighting of PLUG which has been tanking lately. I'm still bullish on ICLN long term It's just been a rough couple months for it
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I'm just hoping PLUG is one of the ones that makes it. I'm fairly sure the EFT will succeed, since it's diversified, but so far I have made (and lost) a lot of money on PLUG."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Fair points. I guess what I should have said was that in these scenarios eventually there will be an attempt to pay for these programs. That imo is the core of this current correction. Inflation is transitory, bond yields will drop, the fed will likely not raise rates for over a year. But raising taxes is happening and the market will have to rerate based on this inevitability. But honestly what the heck do I know? I am not able to speak for “the market” like CNBC does."

I bought into oil around late October 2020. Vaccines were going well, stimmy was being planned, oil supply was being reduced by OPEC+ successfully, yet oil companies were on 25 year lows. No brainer. Once I've taken my profit from this I'll sleep till the next crash."

03/25/2021,stocks,"> . I guess what I should have said was that in these scenarios eventually there will be an attempt to pay for these programs 

I mean, one could argue that we'd have to pay regardless, but the price of not doing anything like these relief programs would be far higher than the cost of the programs themselves.

For instance, it would have been cheaper for the federal government in 2009 to tell the banks that were begging for a bailout to get fucked as they recklessly got themselves into that situation themselves and deserve to take the hit, but the cost of those massive institutions collapsing and taking literally everything down with them would have been far higher in the long run in just about every measure than the trillions we gave them as a bailout... Granted, they still should have passed more regulations with sharper teeth to prevent any institution to get to the level of ""Too Big To Fail"" ever again, but that's a whole other can of worms...

Another example, not authorizing money to go to businesses to help them stay afloat even while shut down due to the pandemic saved thousands of businesses and jobs across the country. Losing those businesses and the jobs they sustained nationwide would have cost far more over a far longer period of time. 

Same with the eviction moratorium and every other major government expense... Instead of looking at the initial sticker cost on the bill itself, you gotta think about the big picture and outside the immediate box you're presented with and ask what the cost of doing nothing would be in the long run instead of the zero it costs at the moment."

The point he was making, is about an attitude I see so much on r/stocks and r/investing, which is that people seem to have such a fundamental lack of imagination or ability to think into the future.

I love the stock market, I have spent my whole life thinking about the future, my future, the worlds, what it looks like, in my day to day life it is not a benefit, but imo for the stock market it is a huge one.

Most people fundamentally cant really get their head around things which aren't concrete or don't exist right now, these are the people who complained that amazon didn't make a profit, or that tsla didn't, or that amd was a failed chipmaker compared to intel or that nvda was just some stupid gaming company.

https://nypost.com/2021/03/24/homeless-man-becomes-first-person-to-live-in-3d-printed-house/amp/

To me it seems like a no brainer that 3D printed homes will become more common as the housing supply stays limited and people are looking to more affordable options. Is there anyone to invest in that covers this niche? If not, what 3D printing companies would benefit from this upcoming trend?

EDIT: Something I wanted to point out to a member that said “but they paid $18,000,000 to build these.”

Yes, 300 residents (homes) which equals about $60,000 per house which is a marvel in Austin, TX."

Automation will rule the world, and it's really not that far off. Full scale 3D printing homes and possibly other construction projects is definitely coming in the future. Will that be 10 years? 20? 50? That's the queation, but saying never is extremely disingenuous.

It's only counterproductive to you because you will potentially be out of a job, but the market does not care about that. Once these machines become more efficient and cheaper, companies will form that will not need any labor and will be able to print houses in days (instead of building them in months).

2021-03-25 15:34:52,stocks,"How do taxes tie into buying stocks? So basically I've been following the whole GME hype train since it was at 20$ and all the way to 400 and back.

(I'm not able to buy due to the fact that I don't meet a certain requirement about being of age) and I really kicked myself for missing out on it even despite the fact that I knew that it was going to blow up.

Now I ended up getting my brother on the hype train, he's a 24 year old student and should be getting out of college soon, I was just about done making him a Revolut account so we could finally buy a few shares in GME if it drops more this week... Until I got to the Data agreement part and saw that it was some pretty legit stuff, multiple white papers with his name and data and everything on it, multiple agreements and rules to read and it asked for his tax number at the start of it which is just his normal ID number

Until this I thought that investing into stocks was just something as simple as buying a product albeit with KYC but now after reading through I see that there's a lot more to it, specifically... taxes.

We were both born in Romania and we both have a citizenship here, to my knowledge my brother doesn't pay any yearly taxes since he doesn't own anything, he lives with my parents so no house, doesn't own any cars.

Recently I got him into ""that special currency"" too and managed to buy some on Binance, albeit I didn't know that this is apparently taxable too since it's a profit.

Let's say that I buy 2 shares of GME at 100 and they all turn into 500, I sell, GME dies off, and I delete the Revolut account, how in the fuck does this all tie into my government and my brother having to pay taxes?

I don't really understand how the government will find out in the first place that I bought 2 shares.

Is it taxable only if it's above a certain ammount?

How much is the tax on buying something as low as 200 and a gain of 800?

It's not like Revolut or their broker will go out of their way and inform every single government for every single share that somebody buys.

There's no tax or anything of the sort for just opening an account right?

Will somebody enlighten me?

Thanks in advance.

&#x200B;

TL;DR How can the government tell that I bought shares and how will the taxes be deducted from a 24 year old who to my knowledge pays no taxes."
03/25/2021,stocks,read up on capitol gains taxes..if you buy a stock at 100 and sell it for 200 then your capitol gain is 100 and that is what is taxed..the rates can be foundon government websites for the us it is irs.gov
03/25/2021,stocks,Do your DD on the realized gains tax.
03/25/2021,stocks,"ALL income is subject to tax, not just stocks. Whether or not your brother meets the minimum income to file is another story. If you buy a pair of sneakers and flip them for $500 profit you’re supposed to report that. and yes your broker reports every transaction to the government."
03/25/2021,stocks,"> It's not like Revolut or their broker will go out of their way and inform every single government for every single share that somebody buys.

Yes, they do. That's the whole point of collecting all new user's data like their tax ID, etc.

At the end of the year, all brokers are required to report to the government how much every single user gained or lost on their platform throughout the year.

So they absolutely would report that your brother had an $800 profit.

If your brother did not claim that on his taxes, it *may* flag something in some database and they may decide to audit him to find out why they have a record saying he earned profits but he never claimed it on his taxes.

At the very lowest, it looks like the minimum would be 10%, so he'd owe at least $80 in taxes. He should probably just claim it and pay it, rather than risk them auditing him and fining him even more for not reporting it.

(I'm not a tax person, this isn't advice, etc.)"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I found a person that explained it pretty well for my country, the tax here is 10% from your winnings, but from what I saw from another site, in order to declare my winnings my brother has to go to the ""tax reciever"" and declare that he earned x ammount and then they'll take 10%

But HE has to go to them and nobody is forcing him, I'm guessing that if he doesn't go he'll be commiting tax evasion as they call it, but I don't see how it's regulated since there's no way for them to find out that he bought 2 shares in the first place"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Just did and I got a grasp on it except for how they'd know that he bought 2 shares and that he made any profit since he has to declare it, I'm guessing it's tax evasion... 

So that's the thing to make you pay your taxes?Fear that somehow they'll find out that you made a profit yet you didn't pay that 10% tax?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Indeed, I saw that all income is subjected to tax, I guess the argument that school doesn't teach you this stuff is viable but I'm slowly learning, never knew that any profit you make is subjected to tax and nobody ever told me that, but the real question is, do they even really care if some 18 year old just flipped a pair of sneakers and made 500$?

It's not like they're going to go and waste so much time just so that they could tax 10% from 500$ and from what I see it's just a matter of if you want to be honest and a good guy Steve and pay your taxes, albeit if the broker reports transactions to the government that's a whole different story"
03/25/2021,stocks,Whatever brokerage you use should give you a tax statement before tax time
03/25/2021,stocks,"The answer is no they probably wouldn’t find out if you did it once. Probably not even if you did it 20 times. 

Anyway. I’m not an accountant or lawyer and this isn’t a tax evasion sub."

Decided to reinvest the money in “safer” places. About £1000 in apple, £650 in travel stocks (which I knew would be a rocky road), a dash of Sony and some penny stocks that could have potential. The plan was to hold come hell or high water, but EVERYTHING has taken a real beating the last few days. Nobody ever made money selling at a loss, but would it be wiser to sell now, wait for things to stabilise a little then buy back in at the (possible) lower prices, or stick with the plan and just hold?"

I started to learn slowly about, earnings, P/E radios, different sectors, indexes, some technical charter things ect. Now I'm still a noob, but have a much better picture of how stocks work. But this last month really killed me. I'm down -21% overall on my portfolio, I own mostly tech, renewable, and SPACs. Now I'm in a really confused place, 2-3 month ago during the tech all time high, I was reading how tech is the future, all those analysts giving price targets (example NIO, I saw a lot of price targets to 70-80$). I was reading how Palantir is the future of data analysis, and how it signing big contracts, I was reading how Biden will push renewables, and that renewables are the future, solar, fuel cells act.. Now over night, I'm reading how tech is overpriced, SPACs are in a bubble, you most rotate to value stocks, Palantir earnings are decreeaimg making bigger loses, workhorse is fake company, and lost a big contract. NIO is at a risk of being delisted because it's a Chinese company (like we didn't know this before), chip shortage will slow down the production ect..I feel like I'm being manipulated by all that news and lied. What should I do now, sell all my tech, renewable, and growth stocks and move my money to ""value""? Because, well.. tech is not the future anymore for some reason? I understand tech stocks went up too much in 2020, but why then all the news where pumping tech even more and all those analysts giving big price targets?"

Average is important as it doesnt mean you get it every year. Markets have been providing good returns over last couple years so it wont be a bad thing if it takes a break this year. But I can tell that you have done right thing by starting investing, this is the place to grow compared to have cash in bank.

Remember: Our earlier March bottom was much lower than here: SPY 3724 and QQQ 12421. I'm not sure we reach that low again, but I expect us to come dang close before March mercifully concludes. If you have any dry powder left, figure out what blue chippers you want to load up on when everything truly goes on fire sale again. Personally I'm looking at ETSY, MSFT, and WBA, which I bought a ton of during our previous March low.

In the meantime, nibble at the deals at the end of these massacre days. The final 15 minutes bring the best prices. Be patient. I've been adding small amounts of CRSR and FSLY, and MSFT when it's closer to $230."

-the ARKK dip is like a nice burger.  Seems pretty affordable right now and there could definitely be a nice payoff; however, there's a time and a place to order a burger, and this might not be it right now.

-the Disney dip is a steak at a restaurant that's not a great steakhouse.  Will it get completely messed up?  Probably not.  Will it be overcooked and maybe a little too fatty?  Possibly.  All in all it's probably not a bad decision but there might be better options.

-the Apple dip is a nicely seasoned ground beef.  Solid, reliable, not a sexy option but at least you know what you're going to get.  There might be some short term consequences (gas) but you'll most likely look back on the decision with fondness.

IMO it's as simple as- Bumble is popular with women, and women drive the dating market. Women, especially ones who are more attractive, prefer Bumble because it's easier to weed out the creeps. And men want to use the app with the hottest women.

Also, I think dating apps will see a resurgence with everyone vaccinated. People be horny yo. Though whether that's already priced in, who the hell knows.

03/25/2021,stocks,"I think the reason I'm taking this correction so hard when it isn't that even that big of a drop is because it's teaching me that I'm playing a game with people I don't understand.

2020 taught me that the stock market had nothing to do with reality. 

During a pandemic and one of the worst bouts of unemployment the US has ever seen, the stock market doubled. 

Elon Musk became the richest man on earth, not because his company was making a lot of money, but just because people liked his memes.

By 2021, I feel like retail investors had learned all this and we were ready to play this like a game -- and we did. We skyrocketed a failing company to more than $400 a share, not based on fundamentals, but entirely based on memes.

The problem is that, when we did that, it became painfully clear that the other people playing -- Wall Street and the Boomers -- don't realize it's a game. They went on TV talking about ""the fundamentals"" and saying things like, ""I get Tesla's valuation. That one makes sense to me."" when Tesla's valuation really just should not make sense to *anyone*.

That's the frustrating part -- realizing that the long-time players still think that their insane movements are based on fundamentals. So much so that, now that we're reopening, they're saying: ""This Amazon company is about to become obsolete. Dump all of that and put your money in the stocks of the future: Coca-Cola and Kraft-Heinz!""

Last year taught me that stocks have nothing to do with reality. This year is teaching me that they have everything to do with what Wall Street *thinks* reality is."

Today, I'm forecasting a red day with a NASDAQ high of 13,008 and a low of 12,725.

Yesterday, I was wrong. Really, really wrong. So wrong that I'm having a minor existential crisis about it. So let me talk through my reasoning here and, if it's dumb as hell, let me know.

1. **We're definitely going down.**  
Technicals on the NASDAQ, QQQ, and every major tech stock look terrible. MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, and TSLA all look like Wiley Coyote looking down and realizing that there is no ground under his feet.
2. **I don't think enough people are going to ""buy the dip"" to make today green.**  
There was a chance of that, but J. Powell [opened his mouth](http://cnbc.com/2021/03/24/stock-market-open-to-close-news.html) this morning and made everyone mad.
3. **Positive market data may keep us from falling too fast.**  
The first positive market data all week came out this morning, with j[obless claims dropping](https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/nation-world/us-jobless-claims-drop-march-25-2021/507-d3c4d6ff-5311-42ca-aeac-8a17a5938df7) and the [GDP growing](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP). I think that's going to keep us from dropping *too much* today, but it won't be enough to give us a green day.

My reasoning yesterday was dumb as hell. I don't think it is today. But let me know if it is before I blow 10% of my portfolio again.

*Past predictions and visualizations can be* [*seen here*](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/1Jw6B)*.*"

If you look at the second by second chart (I use range because I don't want to pay for tradingviews second by second, you see that bitcoin began to take a big drop at around 12:24:58. At 12:25:40, the US500 began to retreat. There's a 42s difference, and if I had to guess, that was from people realising bitcoin was continuing to push down. Another example was one just passed. At 13:06:40, Bitcoin began to retreat, taking a pretty sizeable hit. At about 13:07:10, the US500 began to take a hit, similar to that of bitcoin. 1 more example I can give is that bitcoin bottomed out at 13:15:17. US500 hit its bottom at 13:16 before pushing back up. There is plenty more evidence to support this if you look through the charts, but these gaps have been consistently in BTCs favour."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Pretty much! And when JP speaks, stocks tank no matter what he says, except for one time when they went up after a random investor nobody knows said that everything is fine."
03/25/2021,stocks,Stocks only go down.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Pension funds rebalancing, selling stocks to buy bonds. This is why both stocks and yields are going down right now. It also means its not tanking due to some doom news, will likely recover."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Seriously, this shit is ridiculous"
03/25/2021,stocks,This is the way.
03/25/2021,stocks,I wish sane comments had as much as upvotes are childish panic comments
03/25/2021,stocks,"As we make substantial further progress toward our goals, we'll gradually roll back the amount of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities we've bought,"" Powell told NPR's ""Morning Edition"" in a live interview. ""We will very gradually over time and with great transparency, when the economy has all but fully recovered, we will be pulling back the support that we provided during emergency times."""
03/25/2021,stocks,Less help from papa powel means you’re on ur own
03/25/2021,stocks,"Something like PPLT might be a good hedge. It should increase with inflation and is positively correlated with a strong economy. So if we see either or both of those scenarios, this should go up."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Inflation itself is bullish for equity prices. The less the dollar is worth, means asset prices will climb in dollar worth even without experiencing actual growth in the company. It's the raising of rates that will kill stocks, and stocks are falling now not due to inflation, but due to the perceived threat of rates being raised earlier than scheduled. If yields reached 2.5 soon and jpow announced they're raising rates, the LAST place you'd want your money to be in is equities"
03/25/2021,stocks,LOL  u/wsb_shitposting
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hey! I was right today!

I mean, ok, it technically ended green by a tiny margin, but I got the highs and lows right."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Don't worry, it's all red already"
03/25/2021,stocks,Yea something like 50% VTI 30% QQQ 20% VTV and you just dump your pay checks into the reddest one every months. Would do better than trying to pick stocks imo.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Lot of despair in the air around here lately. Feels like we're close to the bottom for tech.

And Powell won't be speaking for another few weeks so that's a bullish sign lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,the last month+ has followed the same exact pattern. we’re still in that pattern
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think SPY is going to hit the lower bollinger band on the 1 day chart at 380$. After that, it either bounces or crash down to 370. I believe the former will happen, probably a bounce, and a fairly nice one, like, retest 400 levels."
03/25/2021,stocks,Is your name....Reek?
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm thinking that subsistence farming might be a good value play. May barter car for chickens and a quality plow. I'll wait for input from Cramer and MarketWatch before pulling the trigger, though."
03/25/2021,stocks,don't forget gold
03/25/2021,stocks,what do you expect? youtube is a cesspool of clickbait garbage trying to stretch their vid duration because of how the monetization works
03/25/2021,stocks,yea don't watch
03/25/2021,stocks,Name and shame please.
03/25/2021,stocks,"His strategy is on point, just the expectations and predictions were wrong. However with nothing much changing the fundamentals and growth trajectory  of nio yet, keep buying is certainly the right move."
03/25/2021,stocks,Depends on when you plan to buy a house. You'll have to search pretty hard to find someone who will suggest you put short-term savings for a house down payment into stocks.
03/25/2021,stocks,Also will be buying house. Now is not the time
03/25/2021,stocks,Signs point to yes
03/25/2021,stocks,Almost certainly at this point.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Probably. But it gave me a chance to close a deep in-the-money put I had sold for only a small loss, and sell a covered call."
03/25/2021,stocks,What a MONTH!
03/25/2021,stocks,Glad to see I’m not the only doug getting Fd by this market too.
03/25/2021,stocks,Don't ask questions.
03/25/2021,stocks,Until tomorrow when its red again
03/25/2021,stocks,I propose a new legislation where Powell Isn’t allowed to speak anymore. Cant have him messing up the predictions.
03/25/2021,stocks,Shoutout RiRi
03/25/2021,stocks,Look at mr rich and fancy over here only losing $350 a day
03/25/2021,stocks,"its coming back down now lol.

From what alot of peeps saying is wait to the summer. most will go back to green"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, see this too. That’s why i’m thinking we could see a drop of around 8% over the next week or so even from here. I really think this may go lower than the early March lows before consolidation and reversal."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Around the early fall ATH was good support on the NDX side early March which really isn't that far away, but I'm guessing that falls and we see...

11.5k soon (the Election Day gap)."
03/25/2021,stocks,Thinking so as well
03/25/2021,stocks,Wtf why is it stabilising it has to tank further this doesn’t make sense.
03/25/2021,stocks,Its going to 13000 strap in.
03/25/2021,stocks,Where is next support?
03/25/2021,stocks,Absolutely
03/25/2021,stocks,Curious how long ago did you start?

03/25/2021,stocks,gag him
03/25/2021,stocks,He decided to get to it early today!
03/25/2021,stocks,I've come to fear and loath Chairman Pow
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm thinking the squiggly little lines will go to the right.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, of course."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yellow.
03/25/2021,stocks,I just assume red all the time these days
03/25/2021,stocks,Shiiiiiiiiiiine aaawwwwwwwwn yoooooouuuuoooooooo craaaazy daaaiiimooondddd....
03/25/2021,stocks,finally. a NKE dip that is meaningless in substance and will be short-lived. NKE has just been on a constant upward trend with few dips to buy.
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m starting to fear green pre-markets haha
03/25/2021,stocks,"My account was -3,000 during pre and is now back to -500 7 minutes after opening. Felt like a big weight was lifted off my chest I tell you what."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yes. Sell low.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Lowest unemployment numbers today since the pandemic. He's upping vaccine distribution. Might discuss the infrastructure bill.

I only see positives."
03/25/2021,stocks,"By trying to time the market you will potentially lose more gains as it's essentially gambling. 

HODL."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Dont speak too soon, whole lotta day left lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,This guy should get arrested for insider knowledge.
03/25/2021,stocks,This is the confirmation bias I needed
03/25/2021,stocks,Whole market is down. Nothing we can do but watch now.
03/25/2021,stocks,Imagine believing there is a bottom.
03/25/2021,stocks,nothing and wait until my payday to everything being green again
03/25/2021,stocks,T
03/25/2021,stocks,Priced in. Prepare for more blood.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm so jealous of people who got to buy this at ~$30. I really wanted to average down, but it's already 10% of my individual stocks portfolio and I wasn't willing to expose myself to even more risk, especially in this market environment. 

Average price $37 and I've been bleeding for over a month. So happy to see some green, just hope it can last..."
03/25/2021,stocks,Oooooooo did your trading app not give you the Robinhood confetti feature 🎊 😂
03/25/2021,stocks,"we usually have a green day after a blood red day, but it never makes up for the losses, and the next red day pushes them down more. that's been the pattern for over a month"
03/25/2021,stocks,"It’s not a rotation back into tech until the NASDAQ stays reliably green for at least a few days. That’ll be when the algos are kicking in and buying and we see a flurry of new price targets from institutions to pump up the stuff they’ve already bought.

As of right now, the Dow is still king and it’s not even close."
03/25/2021,stocks,Seriously. Was down 1% this morning and then went to 3.4% up. I thought it was a glitch when I saw it.
03/25/2021,stocks,"> “As we make substantial further progress toward our goals, we’ll gradually roll back the amount of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities we’ve bought,” Powell told NPR’s “Morning Edition.” “We will very gradually over time and with great transparency, when the economy has all but fully recovered, we will be pulling back the support that we provided during emergency times.”

NOOOOOO WHY WOULD YOU SAY THIS"
03/25/2021,stocks,Screw him.. whenever he speaks i’ll sell all my stocks and buy shitcoin.
03/25/2021,stocks,Someone muzzle that fucking guy.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Nope, tech is dead!! Just threw out my phone and got myself a nice wheat farm"
03/25/2021,stocks,Buy a little each day on what you think is a good discount.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Combination of that, plus lingering inflationary fears, plus end-of-quarter rebalancing by the big, algo-run portfolios. These final days of March are going to be a bloodbath, for sure. Just hold, ignore your losses, and the buy blue chippers on big discount where you can."
03/25/2021,stocks,"pension funds rebalancing makes the most sense imo. The 10 years keeps dropping every days, someone is selling stocks to buy bonds massively."
03/25/2021,stocks,"SPY is 3% off ATH, this isn't a crash more of a return to the mean in some sectors that have become overvalued."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Definitely a crash for même ,biotech and hype stocks ( many of them tanked at least 30%) the rest correction."
03/25/2021,stocks,we will watch this portfolio with great interest
03/25/2021,stocks,"Doesn't matter, question is what happens tomorrow and next week?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Yes there was definitely a jump. I don't trust any of it but we could stay green through tomorrow
03/25/2021,stocks,"It has dipped along with all covid gainers. Great long term pick though. Buy a little, and add later."
03/25/2021,stocks,Bull trap to dump tomorrow.
03/25/2021,stocks,Buy more it will go up eventually.
03/25/2021,stocks,JUST UNDO IT.
03/25/2021,stocks,hey at least you didn't get short term call options!
03/25/2021,stocks,It'll fall under $230 again. I bought a bunch of it at $226/$227 when we bottomed earlier in March. I'd love to add more at those levels.
03/25/2021,stocks,Unlikely. MSFT has strong current and future earnings. This is still the consequence of T year treasury yields rising. Big asset allocation and quant funds are selling speculative stocks and rebalancing into bonds at these higher yields. MSFT is now the blue chip leader and seen as a flight to safety equity.
03/25/2021,stocks,"> MSFT 

I swear this stock is invincible, it hasn't dropped anywhere near as much as it did in September/October."
03/25/2021,stocks,That’s what we said three weeks ago.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Sure, but take a look at MT. This is the bull in the parade bruh."
03/25/2021,stocks,______ getting destroyed. Fill in the blank with whatever.
03/25/2021,stocks,lol you must be new
03/25/2021,stocks,Which tickers?
03/25/2021,stocks,This is what CSCO holders said in 2000
03/25/2021,stocks,honestly thats about the same level of DD i do half the time
03/25/2021,stocks,"Oh just use ""time.machine"" toggle"
03/25/2021,stocks,I like their TVs (I've owned 3 of them) and their TVs are everywhere in stores. I bought 20 shares when it went live.
03/25/2021,stocks,Let's cherish today. Our phones will be there to disappoint us first thing tomorrow morning.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I feel like they were talking in terms of years and decades as opposed to weeks and months. 

Just be patient. We're not going back to the dark ages* any time soon, I don't think."
03/25/2021,stocks,With time those Boomers are and will be right. I'm still buying my high-conviction tech names
03/25/2021,stocks,"Boomers: buy when the market is red. OK

Buy when it is red! OK did that again.

Buy when the market is red! Cool, did it again.

Buy when the market is red! \*gasp\* ok managed to get some more cash and did.

Buy when the market is red! ....... out of cash :("
03/25/2021,stocks,ye bugged
03/25/2021,stocks,"Trust me, that’ll save your eyes an extra 20 years of life."
03/25/2021,stocks,“If” 😂
03/25/2021,stocks,No need to rush in. Wait a bit to see where this goes
03/25/2021,stocks,Go for it. Amd at 75 is a bargain . The same goes for nvidia.
03/25/2021,stocks,"AMD is solid bargain rn

have a look at intel too, quite cheap & a new CEO."
03/25/2021,stocks,INTC has brought out the big 💪
03/25/2021,stocks,"Im looking to get AMD, QCOM and then AMAT once it dips (seems to havs survived all this BS better than most)"
03/25/2021,stocks,I would stay far away from QQQ unless you want to join the sad people of this sub who complain daily about the Nasdaq
03/25/2021,stocks,DIA is set to outperform IMO
03/25/2021,stocks,If I were you I’d sit on the cash at least until we see a 2-3 consecutive green days in a row. Just my opinion
03/25/2021,stocks,DKNG and DIS already substantially lower. I'm bad at this
03/25/2021,stocks,Looks like i picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah I’m mostly in VTI and I’m pissed with the performance so far. But I guess it can only go up
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ah no, I love Vizio TVs and their price to performance ratio is arguably the best for all TV makers, but their smart cast platform is garbage and only available on their TVs.  They are not a competitor to Roku at all."
03/25/2021,stocks,It's barely up? I wouldn't trust AH at all
03/25/2021,stocks,What reference
03/25/2021,stocks,What movie?
03/25/2021,stocks,"As long as you don't sell, you haven't lost anything yet"
03/25/2021,stocks,Same here. Crazy to think I was up 15% all time just 2 weeks ago.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Close to the bottom, but prolly gonna dip more on Friday. I plan to buy then."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I buy a little with every weekly pay cheque. I'm not fussed on timing this one and have no real buy in price. When the price crosses 1000, I'll probably stop my weekly adding, replace it with another stock, and just hold whatever my position is from that point."
03/25/2021,stocks,"If it goes below 600, I'd jump in. I regret not doing so the last it went down to 570ish. It shoot back up to 700ish after a couple of weeks ."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Set buy limit orders all the way down from 298

It might just pull the S+P down to 3700 if we're lucky"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Much better than expected

but don't worry, we can spin this negatively, that means companies are starting to waste money on employees again"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Never a bad time to buy any if those. 

I like Apple alot at these prices"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Those are all great stocks. In case you aren't into ETFs yet, have you looked into broad ETFs like VOO? The top 5 holdings: APPL 6%, MSFT 5.4%, AMZN 4.1%, FB 1.9%, GOOG+L 3.6%.

I can't recommend/r/Bogleheads enough, cheers and good luck!"
03/25/2021,stocks,Powel made a statement this morning.
03/25/2021,stocks,Likely new covid restrictions/lockdown across Europe. It's fucked over here.
03/25/2021,stocks,Bought in at 156 kill me plz
03/25/2021,stocks,"Won’t hurt to buy a few shares, if it keeps going lower buy some more if you have cash in hand. If not, just hold."
03/25/2021,stocks,Makes you feel smarter which further validates your probably shitty decisions. Maybe I’m just speaking for myself here lol.
03/25/2021,stocks,"What's ""we are""? Small caps are getting destroyed, but even the NASDAQ is in red YTD, aka, under 2020's peak."
03/25/2021,stocks,"We have an expected 6.5% GDP growth this year, I don't think the market is overbought. The main thing to look out for is vaccine rollouts imo, that is going to be the make or break for this post-covid boom."
03/25/2021,stocks,Depends on what you hold. If it’s not a meme stock then no.
03/25/2021,stocks,The mouse
03/25/2021,stocks,DIS. Nio is china stock therefore risky. ARKK has too much reliance on tsla which is too volatile. i've never heard of run.
03/25/2021,stocks,Can’t fuck with the mouse. DIS.
03/25/2021,stocks,Tsla is almost touching 600 again
03/25/2021,stocks,Run is a guaranteed winner by eoy
03/25/2021,stocks,If you're worried just buy half of what you're looking to buy today and buy the other half tomorrow.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I mean it has to be going up for real this time, right? For what logical reason will the market continue to tank?"
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm about to 100 shares of pltr and thinking of selling cc's for the first time. What's working for you?
03/25/2021,stocks,Still holding Apha shares...
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's an ETF but I like VDC. Gives you KO, PEP, WMT, HD, PG, and COST among others."
03/25/2021,stocks,WMT and HD are solid choices in my opinion
03/25/2021,stocks,Good long term. Hoping it gets back to over 260 by end of year at this point.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah wow what's going on with the stock? Any bad news?
03/25/2021,stocks,Chinese stocks are a coin flip.
03/25/2021,stocks,Good chance to get in because they’re Google of China or Asia. I’m waiting for it to fall below 200$.
03/25/2021,stocks,Is this a reply to someone?
03/25/2021,stocks,yes
03/25/2021,stocks,Yep
03/25/2021,stocks,Genius. You should apply for Italian president first
03/25/2021,stocks,Red futures means red trading day. Green futures means red trading day.
03/25/2021,stocks,RIP every stock. Sea of red. Its hard to watch
03/25/2021,stocks,So is your family to blame for all this? Guys. GUYS. ITS NOT THE BONDS. ITS THIS GUYS FAMILY.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Could be a tank, could be a wobble before uptick, could be a late day or AH sell-off coming

No need to worry, it can’t be predicted and only daytraders have to be concerned about this stuff"
03/25/2021,stocks,Lol I’ve bought all three and now I don’t feel so good. 🥴
03/25/2021,stocks,Thank you for your sacrifice.
03/25/2021,stocks,why?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Bumble is old news, the girls in NYC are obsessed with Hinge these past 12 months."
03/25/2021,stocks,"This is all anecdotal, but personally for me and my circle of friends, we rank Hinge > Bumble > Tinder for dating apps."
03/25/2021,stocks,“People are horny yo” lol if sex can’t drive a stock up what can at this point.
03/25/2021,stocks,"As a former dating app user, I can verify that it is way better than Tnder"
03/25/2021,stocks,"We've been actively removing GME posts and directing people to the stickied meme thread.  If you see GME posts or WSB style posts/comments, please report them so we can remove them if necessary. There are a heck of a lot of comments being posted every day and trying to read layers and layers deep into every comment thread is almost impossible."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's not a game in the sense that you describe it. Stock prices are always based off of supply and demand... but that demand can be real (based on fundamentals) or artificial (hype, memes, etc.). Both types of demand impact the prices of stocks exactly the same."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Short term, the market is extremely unpredictable, even for experts. Its logical when you think about it: If we could easily predict the market, we would all become rich.


But long term its different. If you are long on a company with a bright future, eventually the earning reports will speak for themselves and it will go up. Its irrelevant if amazon is being ignored in 2021, in 2023 it will prove how amazing its growth is and people will flock back to it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"in your analogy it seems to be that you think retail drives everything and the game is in your favour in any way

institutional traders always win the game because they made the game and the rules are in their favour."
03/25/2021,stocks,Elon is not richest man.
03/25/2021,stocks,To much reading did not listen
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's not for no reason. It's technical.

The NASDAQ reached yesterday's close. People used that as a sell limit, and stocks started dropping again.

You can't use fundamentals to figure out the minute-to-minute movements of the stock market. Anything fundamental will take days to years to have effect. Minute-to-minute, it's technical analysis that matters."
03/25/2021,stocks,What are you holding?
03/25/2021,stocks,Roblox is way too overvalued. If I were you I would get TSM they’re undervalued right now and are the worlds leading semiconductor. However you’re on the right track dude 100% because Corsair is undervalued and it’s sure to bring you some solid gains if the institutions jump on it.
03/25/2021,stocks,Biden spoke.
03/25/2021,stocks,it went up 1 point bro
03/25/2021,stocks,Bingo this was all a play to pork the retail investor and average Joe. The big players are laughing as they shred our wealth
03/25/2021,stocks,"AMD, NIO, INTC, all great long term plays. 

I’m personally hoping for a larger dip on Enphase before buying in. Wish I had more free cash right now as by Q3/Q4 we will be looking at a post pandemic bull run"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think long term (5+ years) this entry into AMD will be a huge payoff. I would love to get in right now just dont have the funds for it. 

I also think Qualcomm is a steal at this price too"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I had swing trade entry targets for Nio at 38 and AMD for 78. How quickly they blew past them makes me kinda pause, I'm personally hoping they either consolidate at these prices till friday, and will buy then if so."
03/25/2021,stocks,I don’t think so but knowing our luck he’ll make a surprise appearance just to tank the market
03/25/2021,stocks,It's like schrodingers cat. You're both profiting and losing until you open the app.
03/25/2021,stocks,Thats what I did yesterday and the day before. The bottom wasn't the bottom.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Whats the main component of your portfolio?

03/25/2021,stocks,"That doesn't make sense. Travel stocks are still hemorrhaging money and NCLH got decimated the other day. All these talks (Inflation, bond rates, tech to value) are nonsense. Value stocks are getting fucked too. The only two green stock in my watchlist are GME and AMC."
03/25/2021,stocks,Travel stocks have been going up since last September. You have already missed the boat probably. It’s just a scam to get you to buy it. Then this guy will start buying tech stocks

If you buy that contract, you will have to pay $550 for the 100 shares of AMC plus the $500 premium, bringing your total cost of ~~$15.94~~  $10.50 per share, which is more than the current price per share of $10.40

03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m sure they do - the issue with this strategy is it will inevitably go wrong eventually, ie you’ll short a stock that will just keep shooting up (ie will be up 50-100% on the day - if a stock has already risen 25% it could easily go higher to 50% if it’s not that big and there’s positive news etc)

There’s a reason strategies like this have been likened to “picking up one dollar bills on a train track”. Initially you might do reasonably well and make a decent but modest profit - but then eventually the train will come when you’re not expecting and it’s game over, you lose all your profits and more"

03/25/2021,stocks,"You can sell the 100 shares now at market value, then sell a cash secured put with a strike of 119.

In this case, you will put aside 11900 dollars (in case of assignment), you will be credited the cost of the premium, and then wait to see what happens at expiry. If it is below 119, no matter how far below, you will be buying them back at 119. If it is above 119, you just move on, keep the premium, and you're out.

So I think you might have it backwards. You only buy the shares back if it is trading BELOW the strike at expiry. Only do this if you're happy buying at 119 no matter what happens."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Almost but you got one thing backwards. It would have to be below the strike price for your put contract to be assigned, not above. If it expires above your strike you don't get assigned the shares"

03/25/2021,stocks,ARKK is an etf are you saying you have no faith in all those companies included?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah basically. It will continue until 10 yr yield is inline with inflation expectations. There are 2 main sides to the bond story.

Firstly the bonds are fairly attractive to foreign investors at these yields, especially Japan/European investors that otherwise have fairly anemic government debt to purchase.

Additionally the ""junk"" bond market and longer maturation treasuries are making blended credit portfolios look pretty good now with 3-5% returns depending on risk mix.

On the other hand bonds do need to get to 2% on the 10Y so that means hedge funds will short, people will buy as yields look good and slowly bonds will reprice to inflation expectations."

03/25/2021,stocks,Probably till the end of the month at least eh?
03/25/2021,stocks,"It’s about percentages and opportunity cost of having your money elsewhere. If it takes a year to identify a target, you could far exceed the 10-30 cents a share you get by buying below nav with a bond or maybe even bank interest.

That’s why increasing bond yields drive their price down so much. Cheap bonds are considered a better investment than a below nav spac. To me, spacs are more fun and have greater upside so I’ll stay in."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Seriously, we heard it the first 20 times just lock that guy away somewhere,"
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm bullish on horse and buggy sales this year.
03/25/2021,stocks,Would it be best to sell all my stocks or is this normal?
03/25/2021,stocks,Why is Nike falling? Any news??
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m holding some of my few shares at $211. I’ll be dumping my entire cash once it hits my Price-FCF target $190. I know it’s too far but I’ll stay patient for now.
03/25/2021,stocks,"The strategy hasn't changed. We're still stuck in the same corrective period. Nibble on down days, and buy big when the market melts down for real."
03/25/2021,stocks,"SPWR mainly for American exposure at 12 p/e, CSIQ for Canadian exposure at 16 p/e, JKS for Chinese exposure at 12 p/e. Also enphase because of their dominance over microconverters, and WNDW for a hailmarry. All expected to grow at 20-40% a year which makes their p/e’s kinda ridiculous right now."
03/25/2021,stocks,Huh that's interesting. They went on the low end then dropped quickly. I wonder if it's a good buy at 18 rn?
03/25/2021,stocks,"I mean I wouldn't complain too much, if it weren't for the fact I learnt that quarterly taxes were a thing."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It seems ridiculous, but it will likely pay off in the end."
03/25/2021,stocks,In the future it can help to have a certain limit before going in and buying up the dips. Like only after a 10% drop for example. A lot of people blew through their cash way too early in the correction and missed out on the real discounts.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I've never understood this strategy. Why wait until we're rallying again to buy? You should buy when there's blood on the streets, not when the street cleaner comes in to mop up the mess. You make more money when the market is melting down."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Nah, spread it out over a time you feel comfortable with, starting today could be great, starting tomorrow could be great, starting in two weeks could be great"
03/25/2021,stocks,Dunkirk
03/25/2021,stocks,Dunkirk
03/25/2021,stocks,Bro you need to keep buting and average down. Now ARKK at 111 is an easy buy
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ignore the 2020 peak, sorry what I meant to say is everything as in indexes S&P500, Nasdaq, Russell 2000, since June 2020, right after the covid lows, is exceptionally higher than it was for their respective peaks prior to the covid sell off. What necessarily warrants this frantic bull run way above these highs in such a small timeframe besides opportunistic sentiment?"
03/25/2021,stocks,I second the mouse
03/25/2021,stocks,"DIS seems like a general consensus on red days like this. RUN is solar panels, crazy growth after march2020"
03/25/2021,stocks,"That's my problem. The markets been going down for no good reason. Ya, its up today, but god knows what will happen tomorrow. I feel like I'd be ok buying tomorrow for that extra premium if it meant knowing a bit more about the way the markets moving"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I've only got into it very recently. I've sold 1 atm call and luckily it paid off. Selling weeklies is probably the best bet. I was told selling near the money calls, and if itm on Friday, rolling out and up for credit works, but I've yet to try the strategy. Selling calls above your average is probably a good plan while the stock is taking a hit. At least then, worst comes to worst, you break even, and get any profits from the next week onwards"
03/25/2021,stocks,nothing really i can find seems like an overreaction to general china sanctions and bs like that? other stocks were down a lot too yesterday tho have kind of recovered. all analysis seem good on it too im getting some fomo now lol
03/25/2021,stocks,"Tbh I would steer clear. They are in decline and most of their rise last year can be attributed to EV hype and Cathy Wood effect.

If you want to buy monster Chinese companies this isn't the one, buy TCEHY, BABA, JD or if you want more growth maybe PDD."
03/25/2021,stocks,I thought it was like a riddle or something at first I was all interested
03/25/2021,stocks,as is tradition
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yep.  I bought a boat, and lots of people are doing the same.  Watch the stats come in for personal spending and luxury spending it’ll be high.  Last week in the US the TSA travel numbers beat the corresponding 2019 numbers every single day.  People have money to spend and they’re tired of not spending it.  I took money out and bought a boat especially seeing that the market was starting to turn.  But yeah of course it’s bonds too."
03/25/2021,stocks,I just have a weird feeling that it’ll be good. These feelings have usually been correct since they go both ways
03/25/2021,stocks,"I used to work for Match.com, I personally wouldn't touch anything under their umbrella. They're good about buying platforms on the rise, but everything they buy sours relatively quickly after and they'd rather move on to the next big thing."
03/25/2021,stocks,They're referring to when TSLA nearly hit 900
03/25/2021,stocks,"PayPal, GOEV, AMD and SOXL"
03/25/2021,stocks,Huh??
03/25/2021,stocks,Oh right. Thanks for putting intc on my radar. Can you elaborate on Q3/Q4 if you don't mind.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Sadly, I can't afford to hold it for 5 years. I'm living in the uk and I'm just about to bring my spouse over on fiance visa and since I'm unemployed right now due to covid and all, I have to rely on my savings to bring her. (I have to meet a minimum salary threshold or have savings up to 62k pounds. I agree on 76 being a good entry point for long term investors though."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hey, nio just recently had a good dip (down to 33ish and it recovered within 3 weeks or so.) I regret not buying that low in hindsight."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Great reference, haha!"
03/25/2021,stocks,I don't think they can spike anymore.   Go try and buy a gun right now lol.
03/25/2021,stocks,I'd say we are in a W shaped correction.
03/25/2021,stocks,Spy never corrected. So short term pain long term gain
03/25/2021,stocks,"The $10.44 is the spot price of the underlying, not the spot price of the call, which is in the 4.65-5.00 range. But yeah, the overall point is still correct. For far in-the-money options near expiration, the value of the option is almost all intrinsic value, i.e. the difference between the strike price and the spot price."
03/25/2021,stocks,Oh ok sweet thank you for the explanation!
03/25/2021,stocks,"Where are you getting the premium of 1044 from? I see the 10.44$ but that was the price of the actual share at that moment., not the premium for the contract, im so confused."
03/25/2021,stocks,I agree on the tqqq. I also thought 93 was a good one and 89 and 86. Hahahhah
03/25/2021,stocks,interesting. I don't know anything about them but have been off and on interested in cyber security. I'll do some reading. thanks for the idea
03/25/2021,stocks,"CRWD just had good Q4 earnings - revenue grew 74%y/y, ARR increased 75% y/y, subscriptions grew 82%, generated 115m cash in the quarter"

03/25/2021,stocks,"Can that guy just shut the fuck up for once?  No matter what he says, every time he opens his mouth, the market falls by a few percent."
03/25/2021,stocks,never stop
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m going to hold over the weekend, after that I’ll know if it’s party time or farty time."
03/25/2021,stocks,at the moment it's very risky with that volatility
03/25/2021,stocks,It has to break through resistance so tomorrow will be a big day.
03/25/2021,stocks,Much appreciated friend!
03/25/2021,stocks,I noticed that! Good spike with all the red lately
03/25/2021,stocks,"You might not be able to answer this but what is preventing someone from just posting publicly all of their picks (not just RB but like any of these ""services"")?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Well i'm setting a limit order so it won't go through right now even if the market was open. Just want to make sure it only charges the commission if it fills which makes the most logical sense.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm 100% positive. I'm looking at the commission rates of $.65 per contract, not the price of the option"

03/25/2021,stocks,"PLTR’s ATH was a volatile spike, it shouldn’t really be a point of reference. It’s pretty reliably floored at around $22. My average is $23 on it, and I think anyone in the <$28 range should be feeling pretty decent about seeing gains by the end of summer."
03/25/2021,stocks,In my mind it really do be like that 🤷‍♂️
03/25/2021,stocks,"I sold PLTR high today (for a loss , but it was up on the day). I'll take what I can get right now."
03/25/2021,stocks,are you going to average down? thinking of doing the same
03/25/2021,stocks,">drizz

THat's what I did last time BABA dipped. And also bought some PDD and JD in case BABA is broken down. And everything bleeding now.

Still stick with BABA though, but I'm now going to increase"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'd think so. The new law only applies to a few companies, yet people overreacted, but it's the nature of the market anyway."
03/25/2021,stocks,Could you tell tim apple to set it back to 116? I need to buy more
03/25/2021,stocks,"I have too many, I got into Virgin way back when, SPAC, EUSG, GNPK, NOAC, SSPK, VGAC, I too hold VACQ. and I’m sure I will add more...I was being a clown but I do take serious diligence to make sure I buy at below 10 prices....if 80% of SPAC mergers succeed then mathematically I should be okay...then again I might eat cement someday.."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I bought RAAC who is bringing Berkshire Grey public. They make warehouse robotics and with e-commerce bigger than ever there is definite growth here.

I also have RTP who will bring Joby Aviation public. Joby is an air taxi company who has been developing their vehicle for years and have hundreds, perhaps thousands of tests already on their vehicle. I can see something like this excelling in a place like Los Angeles and Chicago, where it is a sprawling cityscape to avoid gridlock.

This is not financial advise."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Eh I said guesses but yeah, your right"
03/25/2021,stocks,Clients have taken out money from the ARK fund. ARK had to sell some positions to cover the money being taken out
03/25/2021,stocks,Jump in the waters great
03/25/2021,stocks,Tim apple approves
03/25/2021,stocks,Did you buy?
03/25/2021,stocks,"He will wait for it to come back up and then re buy on FOMO, thus completing the buy high sell low cycle."
03/25/2021,stocks,"My thoughts as well. I'm not looking to buy anything this morning. I'm happy to wait until the afternoon, or more likely the closing minutes."
03/25/2021,stocks,"This is basically it. 

If you absolutely have to stock pick, AAPL."
03/25/2021,stocks,They're going out of business tomorrow! SELL!
03/25/2021,stocks,Honestly I've never heard of them
03/25/2021,stocks,Doesn’t matter today because of what Powell said this morning.
03/25/2021,stocks,I remember everyone said that 2 weeks ago when Tesla was falling. Next day it went back to 700 lol
03/25/2021,stocks,"SQ's one of many tech/growthy names that has a totally broken chart right now (and I'm leaning towards SNAP being a similar case). It could pay off in the next 5 years to add it, but it's not likely to return to its recent ATH anytime soon.

FB is in MUCH better shape but the setup that it had built failing is not a great sign at all."
03/25/2021,stocks,Oh really? It was around 290 just few days ago so was thinking of a call for quick money.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I just smoked, I'm good lmao.. *DISCLAIMER I AM NOT GOING TO HURT ANYBODY  BUT MY BREAKFAST.."

03/25/2021,stocks,"i'm thinking bear market the next couple of months, the bull just went too hard last year"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Bad take. They have the best offerings in their class, but the valuation was too high"
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's hard to tell. There's definitely a relationship there, but there's been very little news lately to suffice the drop we've had over the past week, which makes me think Crypto movement has a bigger part to play than we think."
03/25/2021,stocks,If you say so.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Bro he is using for what is happening for his own gain, did nothing… they would ask him what is going with the market he would say, se have to wear a masks! 🎭"

03/25/2021,stocks,"If it goes up too far, it could be exercised, which I'd rather not have to deal with"
03/25/2021,stocks,"A question about this rule: How do previously large companies than have been hit by Covid fit into this? One I want to be able to discuss is the world's 2nd largest cinema chain after AMC. 

Under normal circumstances it wouldn't break the rule, but has done for more than 12 months now simply because of Covid."
03/25/2021,stocks,On the basis that otherwise it is devastating to my wallet
03/25/2021,stocks,well we bought the dip ok? must be undervaluated!
03/25/2021,stocks,"How so? It’s a billion dollar company and the stock is only worth $119. 2 trillion market cap, they have a 32 PE ratio, and a 29 billion net income last quarter. They have 195 billion cash on hand lmao. Please tell me again how they aren’t undervalued."
03/25/2021,stocks,"How so?

Compared to almost every other company out there, Apple looks like a safe haven. Piles of cash, record breaking profits and revenues , extremely strong brand. The company has no flaws other than being so successful people can’t imagine it growing more."

I will say I'm preparing to weather a long, drawn out storm"
03/25/2021,stocks,"No, you claimed there was no correction and people were whining after being down 5%. I corrected you explaining why they are down 30%+. Never said its smart to go all in on speculative plays."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not sure what you are trying to say. The bollinger band is higher by now, that's why i think it goes down to 380, not 370."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm not a licensed advisor or anything but I think you'll want to plant some carrots too, to hedge against the blight. Diversification is key if you want to successfully Winter come FY2022."
03/25/2021,stocks,"No.

The last ATH in the fall on NDX was 12420.54. We bounced a little under that for a +7.34% move. 

I'm losing hope that those areas hold though. I'm guessing we have a date with 11.5k on NDX and it's coming very quickly."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not good enough, it needs to go deep and hard now or it might recover."
03/25/2021,stocks,No way it goes that low
03/25/2021,stocks,Yikes.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Wait, what? You really think the Comp is going to almost halve in this correction?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hope you have more holdings than just that friend. You're way too growth/speculation heavy.  It can bite you in the ass just as much as you can see big growth. 

I'm in on some SPACs too. They'll come back when the run continues. On the chance we enter bear market, then they will stay dead unless impressive DAs come out. Is what it is."
03/25/2021,stocks,What was your initial investment? When you start day trading for those months?
03/25/2021,stocks,Same crisis under trump. Nothing has changed.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Investors and traders don’t care about that noise, though. They’re far more interested in what he has to say on economic and tax issues.

The media lost it’s cash cow when Trump lost, so they’ll latch on to every loose thread they can tug on in order to get the clicks. This week just happens to be immigration crisis week."
03/25/2021,stocks,His friends bought puts
03/25/2021,stocks,Normal
03/25/2021,stocks,I believe its going to go back up but i could be wrong. I am holding here.
03/25/2021,stocks,this is normal. don't sell.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Wish I knew, wouldn't have gotten calls Monday lol.  Thought I was diversifying outside tech but still managed to get screwed."
03/25/2021,stocks,Something in China
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hard to imagine it getting that low ever again. It’d take a monumental meltdown, while this market behavior remains a normal, healthy correction. I don’t think MSFT will even see sub-$220 ever again."
03/25/2021,stocks,I just looked at spwr but it has negative CFO. What's up with that? Looking at earnings yeah it looked nice but cash flow is fishy
03/25/2021,stocks,"Oh I agree, I was mostly adding emphasis on the fact that we keep going up and down and I've run out of cash to buy :)"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I agree with you and I’ve been DCAing as well, however if I was brand new to investing today, I would rather at least see signs things are going back up for a couple days before buying in. Whatever gains you would’ve made on those 2-3 positive days sitting on cash will likely be a small dent in the losses that we’ve seen in the past couple months, and you’d still be buying the positions at a significant discount from January.  Again, just my opinion."
03/25/2021,stocks,Ohhhhhh. That explains the references everywhere.  That was a depressing movie. What the fuck.
03/25/2021,stocks,Am I supposed to realistically put my money in at this time and expect a continued run or stability in the market after this extreme growth? I wanted to join the fun I just don’t see this stabilizing until there is some stark correction. Just sharing my thoughts.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Because the crash was not caused by a failure of the financial system (i.e 2008). That along with a good overall response by the government with the stimulus checks and lenient policies allowing most companies to survive. After covid it is expected we're going to have a boom economy with a ton of consumer spending. Really the only way I can see the market going through a huge correction again is if we get a third wave or if the vaccine rollouts aren't aggressive enough to vaccinate our most at-risk people and alleviate our healthcare system. I will say though that there are certain sectors (in my opinion) that are walking the wire, mainly airlines and cruises."
03/25/2021,stocks,problem is that even if it goes up tomorrow it can just tank again next week. You won't really have an idea of what's going on until we see successive weeks of green. Just gonna have to take a risk eventually.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm disappointed it isn't a riddle, but I suppose the market is the biggest riddle of all."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The boat yards were empty last year too. Sold my old boat I had for seven years and only lost $4k. Probably could have asked for more and got it too. We bought a new boat last year too and the same dealership seems low on new inventory. 

What did you get?"
03/25/2021,stocks,lol I hope you're right but also don't mind if you're wrong. Still have a bit of $ left for some cheesy dips.
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm holding AMD too so RIP. It will rise again
03/25/2021,stocks,It's a decent portfolio. You'll get the money back.
03/25/2021,stocks,Right around when he was having his conference the market turned. I don't know what he said tho
03/25/2021,stocks,When I say Q3 I’m thinking more of the third quarter of the year (July-Sept). We are likely to experience continued turbulence and I don’t believe we will return to normalcy before summer
03/25/2021,stocks,"Im honestly about --> <-- close to cutting my losses on my ARK investments (Q, prnt & f are down about 8%... k/ w down 15%) and buying into AMD, QCOM, and NET."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yea i bought in at 35.

Due to that recovery, i think there's a strong chance this is the bottom as people(like you) are recognizing the obvious bounce potential before it actually touches that low again.

But fridays are big emotional sell days lately, so i think it could hit 35.55. Especially if it greens up a bit today first."
03/25/2021,stocks,I could easily buy one from any store nearby. It’s the ammo that you can’t hardly find
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, looks like it. Just remains to be seen whether the second drop will be further than the first in early March."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, wsb_shitposting is incorrect.

The contract premium would be between $465 and $500 depending on where in the bid-ask spread you get filled, so you're paying roughly $1,000 to $1,050 for the premium and the shares, which comes out to what the stock is worth today. In other words, you'd break even if the stock price stayed where it is right now."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Lol. 82.68 is my buy in. Only put 500 on it. I do think we may go down a bit more. Who knows. 

I’ve come to realize that the rich are not going to let the market tank. It’s a lot more up and down right now but it does still always go up."
03/25/2021,stocks,Careful they're one of the most discusses security stocks and are on motley fool pick lists. I own CRWD but just be careful it's talked about a lot and you know what that can mean
03/25/2021,stocks,3.6B to the buy side...superrrrr bullish
03/25/2021,stocks,We’re in correction territory and below support so I’m willing to risk it.
03/25/2021,stocks,No problem. Check today's movement and you can see a spike right when the word got out. Didn't realize how big Fool's RB following is.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Nothing is preventing anyone from doing that. Sure the picks are behind a paywall, but it's just another set of opinions really. I pay because I value the deep dives and analyses behind the picks."

03/25/2021,stocks,Baba near 200 is 👌
03/25/2021,stocks,Fridays are usually sell off days and after today's comeback I'd say we're in for a another red/flat day tomorrow but...it's a weird market at the moment so it's anyone's guess really.
03/25/2021,stocks,And I’m guessing it’s not small quantities of money so likely affecting the Nasdaq?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yep. Right after I saw your comment. So I looked at it and thought that you were right. Got me 5 shares. I know that’s not a whole lot, but it’s already made a little so that’s nice."
03/25/2021,stocks,Tim Apple if you would like a job my employeer is hiring. Must have excel experience.
03/25/2021,stocks,I heard they've already announced filing chapter 11. Stock price is up due to removing uncertainty. Investors certain the only direction now is up.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yes but that leaves us with the paradox that good news is bad for the market and bad news is bad for the market. Aka market is weak investors are panicky.
03/25/2021,stocks,Thank goodness for that - having said that I hope you murder the shit out of that brekkie 👍
03/25/2021,stocks,Boo this man
03/25/2021,stocks,You think it's more likely that the entire market is crashing because of crypto pulling back than it is crypto is pulling back because the market is crashing?
03/25/2021,stocks,Lol. No.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Like user above said, crypto market is half of what just apple alone is worth. It’s moving according to the stock market."

03/25/2021,stocks,"We are barely in a 10% Nasdaq correction. The issue is inexperienced investors trying to stock pick. I suggested they would all be way happier and richer in the long run if they just invested and contributed to market indexes.

And they are upset about volatility. If it scares them they are likely more risk adverse then they think. And again should just use market indexes."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah I learnt my lesson with buying too many midcap tech stocks ATH. I looked at a few today and most like twilio, enphase etc are down 20% just in the last month. I like the companies but price grew too fast. Look out for these companies in the next few weeks, might be worth a buy if price keeps going down"

03/25/2021,stocks,Low 7000s is historical with the COVID crash last year.
03/25/2021,stocks,I do but do your own due diligence. Happy to hear the other side as well.
03/25/2021,stocks,It's definitely a learning process! Bought some TSM earlier. Just going to bare with it for now. I'm 30 so got a bit of time to learn from my mistakes. Just hold through!
03/25/2021,stocks,"I would say I started with $1k then grew it to $3k when i was just having fun and it grew to about $4k.

Now I'm about $7k (before losses) and just being patient, lol."
03/25/2021,stocks,Agreed but it will put a shade over the speech
03/25/2021,stocks,This getting absud
03/25/2021,stocks,I think it’s due to investments which is why earnings look better. But tbh that have no debt and projected growth at 35% annually for next few year. As long as it beats to market fine to me.
03/25/2021,stocks,Fair enough. Have my upvote for your well-argued counterpoint.
03/25/2021,stocks,"maybe. but interest rates are low and will remain low until 2023. Pent up demand for travel. Some people suffered during covid, but many just worked from home and stock piled cash. They're gonna spend that eventually. So, its entirely possible this bull run continues."
03/25/2021,stocks,Where else would you put your money
03/25/2021,stocks,First time boat owner here.  I went in shopping for a pontoon but decided to go with a Bayliner VR5.  It’ll fit all of us and friends and yank a skier or tuber a lot faster.  All the outdoor action sports are killing it right now.  It’s been impossible to buy an ATV or RV here for awhile.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, it’s a bummer right now but know these are good investments down the line"
03/25/2021,stocks,He didn’t say anything related to the markets tho other than some passing statements about needing to deal with the semi shortage. I think jpow had more of an affect today and this week. Market is probably happy he doesn’t have any more scheduled statements for the week lol
03/25/2021,stocks,"ARK funds were SO hyped here for months and people think Cathie Wood is a god. 

Right place right time, like most things."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You might want to wait until tomorrow, they might go even lower. I believe if you were to do  that, your gains from all these 3, will make up for any minor losses."
03/25/2021,stocks,"*WHY* would you sell arkk when its low? sell when its green, not when its been crushed to the dirt. If you didn't sell while you were up, wait a few months a sell once it recovers. Set a GTC sell order for breakeven if you must. 

The 'buy high sell low' thing is a meme. I think new traders are taking it too literally."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I dunno. market might be returning to normal. And by any traditional metric, NIO is *still* overvalued, even pricing in current growth. There are hundreds of Chinese EV companies they have to compete with, not to mention TSLA. 

I'm using this dip to buy stocks that I know will eventually go back up, like AAPL/DIS. With stocks like NIO, I can't be sure that their ATH's weren't just bull run euphoria. Then again, you might be right, thats just overly cautious me."
03/25/2021,stocks,Even $POWW is having a correction for some reason too.
03/25/2021,stocks,"That makes more sense, thank you very much!"
03/25/2021,stocks,"so basically let's say, for simplicity sake I would buy the contract at 4.75$ well in the end it would cost me 5.50$ + the premium of 4.75$ = so 9.25$ per share so if at expiration tomorrow the price is 11$ I am making 1.75$ of profit per share, is that correct?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"That’s a fantastic buy in. I just did the same with 2500 more. The nasdaq 100 is literally created to go up. It’s all an illusion just like the Dow, etc to make it appear that everything is great here in the old US of A. Just take a look at 5 year SQQQ vs 5 year TQQQ. There’s your answer. You may go down 10% here, 10 there but it comes back just as quick. It’s all in my ROTH anyways and can’t the money for another 20 years so whatevs."
03/25/2021,stocks,the 52wk high and low make them look a bit like a meme.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Good move bud, time to HODL 📈📈📈"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Here's a case for crypto pulling down the market. If you look at the second by second chart (I use range because I don't want to pay for tradingviews second by second, you see that bitcoin began to take a big drop at around 12:24:58. At 12:25:40, the US500 began to retreat. There's a 42s difference, and if I had to guess, that was from people realising bitcoin was continuing to push down."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Guy is ready for a nursing home man, he doesn’t see the future… he is falling asleep while talking"
03/25/2021,stocks,P/e doesn't tell the whole story. Amazon has a very high pe but their expecting 40 percent growth YOY
03/25/2021,stocks,Average PE in the market is actually 7. What one writer believes doesn’t mean anything. 2 years ago. Tesla was worth under $200 and everyone said it was done and overvalued and then Tesla spiked up. Learn to read the numbers yourself. Apple is a super successful company with money flowing everywhere.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Dude. That is some generic auto profiler. 

You can tell it is bullshit as soon as you get to the part where they say Apple has a significantly worse debt to cash ratio than most companies. 

Apple has almost $200 Billion in cash on hand. 

They have so much cash it is considered a problem because they don’t know where to spend it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"> The issue is inexperienced investors trying to stock pick. I suggested they would all be way happier and richer in the long run if they just invested and contributed to market indexes.


Well i really don't disagree with that, you are right about this :)"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I recommend digital beans. The thing about real beans is that the government is always growing more, so they decrease in value over time. But digital beans are spread over a worldwide decentralized network without government interference. Nobody really uses them for anything, but they keep growing in value and it's ""*impossible*"" that they ever stop. Digital beans are definitely the must-have for your subsistence investor."
03/25/2021,stocks,It recovered without any true catalyst early march as well i just dont trust it.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ok. So if there’s another pandemic then sure, it will happen. Maybe Ebola next"
03/25/2021,stocks,Wont happend.
03/25/2021,stocks,"No, of course I will. Just wonder what makes you think that - is it because that’s the level it was pre COVID?"
03/25/2021,stocks,How??
03/25/2021,stocks,I know. It's been the biggest topic so far it seems.
03/25/2021,stocks,You think? You should really check that
03/25/2021,stocks,"I understand this but wouldn’t that be why it’s currently up so much? Aren’t these things factored in already given the abundance of positivity in the economy returning full force? As an objectively new investor, it just appears to be an extremely risky time to throw further savings into a taxable account given this current bull rush, just seems to be so high with no historical comparisons to mitigate my concerns."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Possibly buy a house and reduce my mortgage significantly vs my continued rent payments... but outside of that, the stock market in hopes to achieve some wealth long term. I figured if returns for the money outweighed the liability for my mortgage that’s a greater opportunity than going the house route."
03/25/2021,stocks,That’s a solid choice. Company has been around forever. All we see on lakes are pontoons anymore. They can be really expensive with massive motors. They are nice for all the room and stuff you can store in it! But your boat will be more than enjoyable! Wipe her down after each use and keep the maintenance up and you’ll be set!
03/25/2021,stocks,"He did though, he said he wanted to invest way more in tech to keep the us competitive with china."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Im definitely gonna watch how the market runs today and consider selling off a few positions and waiting to see it dip more.

Looking at the charts the trend we are on now we will be hitting the dip from early march soon. We are either gonna find support there or tank even harder. I see it on multiple of my tech stocks. It was up. Dropped hard early march. Recovered then now dropped to where we are. I wouldn't be surprised to see it hit there and correct up for a while. But with this crazy market i wouldn't be surpris3d to watch it drop off lower"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I have a sell order for break even pending... 

Duh i aint stupid that buy high sell low is stupid af. However, with the way ARK has been beaten down and honestly many have lost hope in it. I question its recovery. Where as something like AMD, QCOM, NET, etc. I think would return better."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Correct.

This usually isn't how people use options, though. Usually, people do one of two things:

- People with a lot of money buy options relatively far in advance when they are unsure what will happen. For example, if you think AMC is going to $20 but aren't willing to risk the $1,000 you would need to buy 100 shares, you can buy a call option with a $20 strike expiring at the end of April for just $81, giving you an upside of $919 but a downside of just $81.
- People who don't have a lot of money just trade those options before expiration. For instance, someone who bought the call you're interested in on 02/18 would have paid $100 for it, so, by selling it to you today for $475, they're making a 375% profit.

I think everyone, when they first learn about options, thinks about buying ones that are about to expire and exercising them within 24 hours -- but, usually, the potential profits for that strategy end up proving to be very, very low."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Almost, you added wrong: $5.50 share price + $4.75 contract price is $10.25 per share, so if the stock is $11 tomorrow you've made $0.75 per share, not $1.75."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm trying to point out to you that you're making the mistake of correlation equaling causation.
03/25/2021,stocks,None of that is remotely true.
03/25/2021,stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-believed-significantly-overvalued-234056662.html
03/25/2021,stocks,We’ll see what happens when everyone comes back from lunch.
03/25/2021,stocks,This selling is due in part to all the institutions/investors who bought the Covid crash selling now that they qualify for capital gains tax. It’s just part of the equation but I think that’s why the other shoe is dropping now.
03/25/2021,stocks,"The market was frothy before COVID but then the fed and the legislature made it frothier by adding liquidity and lowering rates. Now the fed is going to have to raise rates to curb inflation and the free money party is coming to an end. The V shaped “recovery” was based on nothing other than trillions of dollars having to go somewhere.

I get my support levels from charting the underlying indexes."
03/25/2021,stocks,"RIDE I was out $400. That short seller report hurt. Now AMD I'm down $200. IPOE lowering my average, I'm down $200. TSMC is my only positive lol."
03/25/2021,stocks,I think it was a mistake to wait so long on this PC
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks man!  We certainly saw higher end boats but at the end of the day it was hard to beat the performance, room, and pricing of the Bayliner.  I can’t wait to pick it up! 

What did you get?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Sounds like they guna need my boys MP Materials! Lol
03/25/2021,stocks,">many have lost hope in it

arkk is tsla, pltr etc. those will recover, and with it so will arkk. also - cathie has a 'buy the dip' philosophy, which is smart. you'll be fine."
03/25/2021,stocks,Ah yes! Got cha!!!
03/25/2021,stocks,And how much actual money do I need in my account to buy that contract? 475$ right?
03/25/2021,stocks,Denial.
03/25/2021,stocks,Congress is attacking big tech atm you would think nasdaq would plummet considering the weakness. Just weird to me.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah even a brief one a month ago.

There's too many topics to cover on this one. Yikes"
03/25/2021,stocks,"They all seem to be the same except for options. There are some boats like Cobalt that do use higher end interior materials. But it really comes down to how you take care of it. Wipe stuff down, no shoes in the boat, etc. Our 2008 Glastron we sold was the most low maintenance boat I’ve ever seen. Replaced a leaking impeller gasket before we sold it. That was the only thing we ever had to fix. 

We picked up with a 2020 Four Winns H230RS. Went from 20’ to 23’ and it made the world of difference in roominess."
03/25/2021,stocks,I feel like i loose hope in that sentiment everyday. Hopefully you are right.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Doesn’t spew lies CONSTANTLY and rabble rouse. Cares about facts and science. Puts experts in charge, not his spoiled dipshit crotchfruit. Made politics boring again, the way they’re supposed to be. 

Perfect? Hardly. But Worlds better than your emperor god king cult leader."
03/25/2021,stocks,Looks like lunch is over
03/25/2021,stocks,"Cool, the Cobalt and Regal 20 foot boats were some of the higher end boats we liked at.  There was definitely a difference between the materials and craftsmanship in the Cobalt for sure and to a lesser extent the Regal, but I wasn’t trying to buy an $80-$100k toy."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I am not for Trump either brother, but this is funny, hope you watch him now. Half of nursing home is in staff. Thats why tech is falling. They don’t understand it."
03/25/2021,stocks,Here it goes now its gonna nosedive for sure.
03/25/2021,stocks,Aaarg why is it going up. Im gonna tune out for now don’t get it.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Oh for sure! At the end of the day, it’s going to get you on the water and you’ll have a good time. Get some skis/wakeboard and have a good day out!

I felt the Cobalt is reserved for the retiree crowd."

03/25/2021,stocks,They just look at the price and watch CNBC and regurgitate what they say
03/25/2021,stocks,"> It is obvious shorts have not covered yet

I guess I'm trying to understand the logic of the shorts and the logic of shorts driving the price right now.

Is today jumping because a bunch of shorts had to cover? Why did they have to cover today and not at any time in the past month when the price was higher?

Are all the shorts looking at FINRA and thinking they're only shorting at 15% short interest? It seems unreal that hedge funds are buying shorts based on false FINRA data while Reddit has figured out (not to mention posted very publicly) that shorts are actually over 100%. Hedge funds might miscalculate the future, but I seriously doubt they are idiots miscalculating the present.

At the end of the day all I can say is that nothing about GME's large price movements seems *rational*. That's why I lean towards it being susceptible to pump and dump type schemes rather than perpetually on the verge of a short squeeze."

But seriously, I’m kind of sad it didn’t get that low again. I sincerely believe there’s gonna be (another) squeeze, perhaps even the MOASS, but I believe it could’ve rocketed even higher if the stock was allowed fall to $40 again. The shorts would’ve once again taken low positions and normal everyday people like me would actually be able to afford to get in. 

As of now, I’m not entirely sure how much gas this squeeze has got in it, though I’m obviously hoping it still rockets up. I think it’s pretty clear none of us really know wtf is going to happen though."

03/25/2021,stocks,Why would they sell right now? Someone uncovered the fact that the entire russell 2000 is being shorted to death and now the stock is going violently upward
03/25/2021,stocks,Bro there’s literally no way you could know its price a week from now unless u were a time-traveller. This stock is unprecedented and no one can predict what’s going to happen with any degree of certainty whatsoever. So stfu if that’s all you’ve got to say.

GME is the opposite of that, basically it's a gamble. Whoever has the balls to stick with it, can win or lose big. 

But at the end of the day, people can say 'this will crash, you watch and see' or 'i'm sure the squeeze will happen'. They're bullshitting, nobody knows what will happen, so you better be ready to accept that."

03/25/2021,stocks,"I don't think that's entirely true. I'd say I'm bearish on GME but I'm happy to be wrong. I'd love everyone to get a big payday.

And then people saying, I'm in as long as DFV is in, and the simple truth is that DFV is already a fucking millionaire and his cost basis is like $4 a share. If you're in at $150 or whatever I'd say your outlook is much different and you shouldn't base your trades on someone with a wildly different position."

03/25/2021,stocks,"> I'd love everyone to get a big payday.

That's the right attitude to have, in my view. You being bearish on GME is your genuine opinion, and you want the best for other people. I appreciate you sharing your perspective here in a kindhearted way. Encouraging people to think through their investments is a great thing, and if we come to different conclusions on a security, that's the way it goes. As long as everybody's comfortable and happy with the level of risk they're taking, and they're informed on the risks, then it's all part of the game.

Taking the stock way too personally is something people on both sides have been guilty of. Even though I'm still invested in GME and am hopeful it will continue to do well, I don't appreciate people who are bullish on GME mocking or being nasty to people who aren't on the hype train, either. Generally, if someone's being honest and doing their best to be kind, that's all we can ask for."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Not to be contrary but I honestly don't think it's even especially bearish to value GME at $40. If you look at the history, it'd been trading at like $20-$30 for most of the last 5 years and on a slow decline. Even if you believe the decline was driven by shorts, and even if you believe the Ryan Cohen hype that he's going to revolutionize the company, $40 seems like a reasonable valuation at this point in time.

I mean, speaking as a kid who grew up with EB Games being my favorite store in the mall, I spend way more on gaming now as an adult but I can't really think of any reason I'd want to buy anything from Gamestop."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Same here. If I had just kept my original purchase for $110 a share and not touched it I would be making a killing right now but I kept averaging up, panic sold a couple times, and then bought back at a higher price keeping the same amount of money in, but owning less shares. then I kept putting in more money and buying it higher and higher prices. It was just one bad decision after another. Plus I couldn't stop checking all the time and it was taking away from everything else in life. Really hurts though because when you see those big numbers on the screen showing you've made a ton of money you kind of feel like it's your money, and then when you lose it, even if it's profit, it still feels like lost money. Just like what it went up to after we sold feels like lost money.

2021-03-25 12:29:50,stocks,"How can I find short interest data for a small-cap stock traded on a foreign exchange? I bought stock in [ONCO.ST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ONCO.ST/key-statistics?p=ONCO.ST) at 159SEK earlier this year because I was expecting their stock price to jump after FDA approval for one of their first drug.

They got the approval in late February. The stock jumped from 180SEK to 215SEK and then proceeded to crash nearly 34% down to \~143 SEK, where it is now.

What surprises me is that only good news has come from the company ever since it hit it's all time high at 215 SEK. They're delivering this drug to patients, they're hiring and rapidly, and this quarter they're going to start generating revenue.

The first few days after the announcement I saw the OMX Stockholm 30 was down and I thought that the general market being down is what was causing the stock to slide. Then the OMX Stockholm 30 started going up, and the price of the stock continued to decline.

I looked at analyst price targets and according to Yahoo finance and the average price target is 217SEK, which is above it's all time high.

The only rational conclusion I can come up with for why the price is trading so low is possibly high short interest. But I can't find any short interest data on the stock. Yahoo finance has N/A for anything related to short interest.

Are there any other sources where I may be able to find short interest for this stock?"

But please, don't assume that a stock can only go down because people short it. There are way more reasons for that. It's still trading higher than at the beginning of 2020 and is 75% up from the low in march 2020.

This was your mistake.

Dominos and Costco are probably the only stocks you bought that you won’t lose money in the short term. Everything else, lots of downside ahead."
03/25/2021,stocks,If you look at the general situation of the market you will see that you arrived late to the party. You bought at the end of a bull run.

So you are going to lose to your friends unless you pick good stocks or stick with broad market funds."

I don't know much about your stocks, except the last one which is a Chinese scam, but in general I think if you should assume a stock is ""bad"" by default and only buy if you have a very good reason to think it will outperform to market and is undervalued. Because most stocks underperform in the end, so just picking randomly is a bad strategy.

But since you have a small amount of money, you could just go all in 1 or 2 stocks you have a strong conviction in and use personally, that would be better than just over diversifying into random stocks."
03/25/2021,stocks,Thats great advise. Thank you so much. I just sold my shares of Cheesecake and TR and bought more shares of dominos and Costco

On that day, I thought how stupid it is to pay $6 for a small coffee and I said I bet I could do something better with that money.  I immediately opened a Robinhood account and bought a fraction share of something I knew well.  I saw the amount slowly increase and now each time we go to Starbucks- I forego the coffee (mostly) and just make another small deposit.  Doing that alone for a year and my value is 20% YoY profit over $600 invested.   Where can you get 20% ROI anymore except in the market. Growing my account slow and steady with awesome returns!"
03/25/2021,stocks,What's in your portfolio? If you don't mind me asking.

I have a couple SPAC’s that I won’t bother mentioning because they aren’t moving up... yet. I’m also holding a $FOCS - a financial firm showing solid financials.

The SEC disclosed the investigation in response to a public records request from Think Computer Foundation founder Aaron Greenspan, according to the legal transparency group PlainSite.

The agency’s reported acknowledgment of its investigation follows reporting by the Financial Times last year that revealed SB Northstar, which is controlled by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, as the “Nasdaq whale” behind secretive, risky multibillion-dollar bets on tech stocks during last summer’s market rally.

2021-03-25 09:24:27,stocks,"I love Jefferies - the company, the CEO, the stock (JEF) Jefferies (JEF) is an investment banking and financial services company which I discovered in Q1 because I wanted to play the sector rotation which became very distinct around Mid-February when growth and tech stocks began their free-fall whereas financials and other cyclicals just kept ascending. The run-up in cyclicals has been sharp in the past months but my investment thesis is that they still have much room to grow if macro-economists are right about record GDP growth rates for the US, inflation or no inflation.

Jefferies is one company that has rebounded very strongly from their pandemic lows, beating analyst expectations for 5 out of 5 quarters by delivering record earnings each time - and this includes Q1 2021 with the announcement just out yesterday.

Company announcement: [https://www.jefferies.com/Letters/ltr/1647/03242021](https://www.jefferies.com/Letters/ltr/1647/03242021)

Richard Handler, their CEO, strikes me as a likeable and down to earth person who I can trust with my money. I believe that only such a person would be able to come up with posts such as these: [https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783](https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783) ""10 Random musings from a boomer who has been in the Financial World for three decades"". He readily takes on the 'boomer' title in his stride, acknowledges the power of momentum trading (which has been unbelievable in post-covid 2020), but still has the fortitude to assert his own stance about the eventual return of stocks towards their fundamental valuations (which we have seen play out over the past weeks).

When the news came up about the Fed removing capital requirement concessions given to banks due to Covid (in my mind, it likely meant lower earnings growth), I discarded most of my us banking stocks and was seriously considering taking profits on Jefferies too but I opted not to in the end because earnings were due soon and I had great confidence that they would not disappoint. That faith has since been repaid and I couldn't be happier 😄. I almost feel like putting more money into JEF but that would be violating my portfolio diversification rules.

Going forwards, I expect a gradual slowdown in growth rates (it would be incredible if they could keep up such immense rates of quarterly growth) but Jefferies still looks like a promising play that gets bolstered by the recovery and growth of the US economy. Cyclicals (except maybe airlines who are sitting on a mountain of debt) are my defensive/safe haven stocks for the time being while the speculative growth stocks sort themselves out (i don't feel the correction is quite done yet). Of course, only time will tell if my strategy works out well.

&#x200B;

\#My opinion is influenced by JEF's performance through Q1 2021 and prior quarters, as well as being a recovery play. Their GME price target of $175 published yesterday is a non-factor. I actually feel that price is within the realm of possibility but only if they can successfully revolutionize their online offerings to challenge major incumbents such as Steam/Valve. That probably requires at least a 1 year timeframe and serious monetization of the goodwill GME has acquired. I'm all for retail investors but this does not suit my risk profile nor investment horizon unless GME falls back to $50 a share."

03/25/2021,stocks,"So what happens after reopening and the news gets sold? My guess is things go back to normal aka tech leads the markets higher because its the few sectors that had organic growth over the last year and the next decade will be the golden age of tech because people who never used smart devices, amazon, microsoft teams were forced to use them. 

What happens if the financial hole caused by covid starts to surface? Tech is more recession resilient than financials and industrials. 

Value is good for the next few months but im looking out 12 to 18 months and im placing my bets on tech. At the end of the day, the markets arent going anywhere without tech leading then higher."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Exactly so when the market is doing well they do well, the number of ipos and spacs mergers are making them a killing, investment banks are awsome to take advantage of the market craze without owning any of the risky stocks, but when the party stops ypu don't want to be holding an investment bank, they are heavily tied to the euphoria you are trying to escape which is why they should not be looked at as an alternative to risky growth."

It’s been noticeable that the quality of posts and comments have gone down with the influx of novice investors. It’s due to a lack of experience, however thanks to the Dunning-Kruger Effect these people often feel superior to seasoned investors....including Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch and academics. 


It used to be that I’d come across down right nonsensical (worse than bad) posts or comments every other week. However in the past month that number has increased to once every other day....and sorry but it mostly comes from the dividend investing crowd and the TSLA fan-Boiz. 


Edit: Apparently I need to explain this to the TSLA fan-boiz. First, I’m not saying Cathie is dumb, where in this post do you see her name? Second, I’m mostly referring to the boiz who say “I’m new to investing and I already made ____ in profit with TSLA (or other meme stock), you just don’t know how to invest.” 


Today I was trying to explain to someone what Dividend irrelevance theory is...and somehow this person determined that you can have a 13% “guaranteed” rate of return no matter what the stock price does; meaning the stock can crash 90% and your rate of return is still +13% or more for the year. Well turns out this guy calculates his rate of return by the number of shares bought buy his DRIP per stock....rather than growth/loss in the value of your investments. And ofc he felt like he cracked the investing code of ancient wisdom that us plebs don’t know. So his idea was to buy high yield stocks, hold on and never sell....according to this user it was impossible to lose money with a dividend stock because it always pays a dividend.....I think this takes the cake for worst advice/logic I’ve seen on this sub and that’s saying a lot. 


So I think it’s a great time to remind people. Be careful whom you take advice from. Especially on Reddit and YouTube. There’s a few users out there that are good, but the majority don’t know what they’re doing half the time."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You should be careful with what everyone says. This is why rhetorical thinking matters. People are very biased and will try to convince you into thinking in a way that best suits there own agendas. The color of the candles are forms of manipulation. Stocks imo are a big psychological game.

Wanna know my recent example? With the Chinese delisting fears once again being brought up. My friends who are NIO bulls will say the SEC delisting fears are nonsense. Then my same friend will sell and try to time the bottom and try to create fear by making a big deal about it. But once he buys back into the stock he goes around saying it's no longer an issue and it's just ""noise"". 

Another example is all these articles being posted. This is why I always want to know where investors are coming from. I wish there was more transparency. I don't use WSB like I did years ago. But I loved the ""position or ban"" rule. Then you can see why someone is bullish or bearish on a stock. It makes much more sense why someone says certain things.

Also, most  people started investing this year or last year. So I am always extra careful. I have had many interesting conversations today."
03/25/2021,stocks,I got in a debate with some guy who didn't understand what market cap was who insisted RYCEY could be an $18 stock next year. He just refused to back down even though it was obvious he had no idea what he was talking about.

Ideally I like to see something in-between lazily name-dropping a ticker and throwing umpteen different numbers and speculative figures in there. 

If I'm investing in a stock I should be able to understand the why in 30 second and 300 word formats. Not many people post that kind of stuff, so I don't invest in many things I hear about here (shout-out to the guy who tipped me off on LUMN tho)."

Plus don't speak against EV, Elon Musk or smash some Memed-up as the ""new GME"" stock bias downwards, or they'll push angryly on that down arrow to drown out the non-confirmers from their bubbly filter world.

I just replied to one of these ""OMG my porfolio is getting destroyed in the current market!"" angsty people just to see if I'm proven right again.

I usually stay away from posts with usage of ""Boomers"" and such nonsense. Ie what I guess is people like Warren Buffet, Jeremy Grantham and their very own drunk no-good dad is who I these people angrily all throw into that same moniker?

I especially love people who throw in ""yields"" but can't spell it at the same time, since they never won the first round in spelling bee.

Also, I'm betting you up on ""half the time"" to ""most of the time"" on your ""users don't know what they do"" theory.

The sad part is this:

They don't realize they will, in the long run, make this very sub into yet another stupid one-direction echo chamber. Knowledgable users will learn not engage to discuss or with a counter thesis, since they realize they can instead just make money for themselves by opening a short position on the newly posted meme stock, instead of trying to convince someone it's likely a bad idea to buy ""and hold"" that one."

Seeing a 115 year old company trading at 18 years ago price is an opportunity. Dilution and more considered it's even more likely this could go back up to ATH because of the additional shares.

I do. However when you’re talking to someone who knows very little yet thinks they know more than even the experts....there’s not much that can be done when they think you/experts are the stupid ones and refuse to listen to reason. 


I didn’t mean to come off as rude as I did.  I was just rather peeved. It’s like telling someone the sky is blue, and the person says “no the sky is purple.” But they refuse to look out a window at the sky because they think they’re smarter than you and everyone else. Eventually you’re just like “fine, believe the sky is purple.” 


I used to think a lot of the same things these newer investors do, and I know why they believe it. I’ve been there. It all stems from me wanting to help these people avoid the mistakes I fell into and help them learn faster so they can make more money in the long run. However I take extreme issue when they come in and give advice to people that is horrible...like “you can’t lose money with a dividend stock if you don’t sell because it’ll always pay a dividend” kind of advice, then they refuse to think critically and realize they’re wrong...because they think you and everyone else are dipsticks."

03/25/2021,stocks,"> but I do disagree with people who are okay with losing capital.

Their logic is beyond my understanding. However that’s dividend investing to most people. They don’t care about anything besides dividend income. 


This is the problem I have with dividend growth investing. People will often say “dividend growth stocks out preform the market, that’s why I do dividend investing.” Which is true, dividend growth stocks do tend to outperform the market. Well the issue I have is often these dividend growth stocks have other factors that explain their growth in value, it’s not due to the dividend. If you take a profitable company, with a growing revenue...like duh the share price will appreciate. It’s no different than investing in good solid growing companies for capital appreciation, however they contribute their returns to dividends. Which imho is the wrong way to think, but at least they aren’t advocating the loss of capital as a viable strategy for long term returns....so I’m fine with it. 


Ima pick on Joseph Carlson because he’s popular on YouTube and I actually like some of his videos. You can see his shift from dividends to growth. Yet he claims he only cares about dividend income. Well, when Disney cut their dividend, he bought more because he wants capital appreciation lmao, which goes against his entire investment strategy that he preaches. You can also see where he forgets dividend income when it comes to bonds, he claims that “bonds yields are just too low.” Well....AGG has a yield of 2.68%, and his largest holding is Apple which has a yield of 0.68%. So he refuses to buy bonds because they don’t pay enough in dividends, yet his largest holding pays significantly less. I understand he expects growth in AAPL’s dividend, but his justification is rather inadequate. I emailed him to explain further on why bonds don’t pay enough but Apple does and he has never replied or responded to my email. Imo it’s because he’s starting to realize capital appreciation is king. 



When it comes to Dividend Irrelevancy. I used to be a denier too. It wasn’t until I sat down and read academic research and really sought understanding of it that I realized it’s real. The problem, and this is why many deny it, is there’s no perfect example to compare a dividend stock and a non dividend stock. Hence why it’s still a theory."
03/25/2021,stocks,I think the best term I heard to describe Reddit investing is “crowd sourced due diligence.”

It’s funny to watch people try to explain why the paper is wrong and their “real math” backed by anecdotes is actually correct."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Questions I’d want answered in the wiki so we can ban these posts:


> “What brokerages do you recommend?”


The general answer is Fidelity or TDA. 


> “How are capital gains calculated?” 


“the difference between the adjusted basis in the asset and the amount you realized from the sale”

Sale price - Purchase price = gain/loss 

If you held for less than a year, it’s short term. If you held for longer than a year it’s long term capital gains. Plus this question is more of a r/personalfinance question

03/25/2021,stocks,"Well the general idea is that you can’t time the market. 


While on paper it’s like “duh I’ll just sell at the top, and buy back at the bottom.” It’s hard to do in practice. 


I lurked here during Covid and basically this is what it was like:


Before the crash: Everything is fine lmao 


During the crash: Omg I’m panic selling. 


At the bottom: this isn’t the bottom!!! It’s crashing further!!! 


A few weeks since the bottom: Its going to double dip!!!! Don’t buy!!! This is a trap!!!


A few months later: Am I too late to buy back in?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Because it's impossible to time and the trend of the stock market over the long haul is generally up. One of the best strategies is to just buy every stock in the market (VTSAX/VTI) and hold it until you retire (or for a couple decades) while contributing regularly. This works because the stock market, over a long enough time period, has ALWAYS gone up. People who use this strategy typically do better than the average trader.

The reason for this is because it's impossible to time the market. You may sell and then the stock immediately starts going up and you miss out. You might buy back in when it ""hits bottom"" and it plummets another 20%. You just don't know what's going to happen and the emotional impact of that almost always causes you to make rash decisions that will cost you money. A lot of people think that they're different or special and they can figure it out, but really they can't."

That's where you get these guys BSing financial terms to make it sound like they knew what they're doing. 

I wouldn't honestly have a problem with this if they didn't act better than us for it, but it's always been the opposite.

I invest in a lot of alternative assets which are required by law to distribute dividends, so that theory is meaningless there. However I am of the opinion the key is whether or not the company is trying to grow within those constraints.

My concern is price is just that: price. It can go up 4% per year forever or it can be permanently impaired. With something like REITs at least if you do incur a loss the loss will eventually take care of itself. That touches on the point that other person made which you found nonsensical, but it has in fact worked out with some of my holdings that tend to go up every 2 years then down every 2 years predictably, with the same dividend. Volatility can in fact be profitable here provided it's not a true value trap like T, which I hate.

03/25/2021,stocks,"> I'm not saying that all new investors are like this, but I'm seeing a good chunk who have this attitude. 


Well. They just made 150% on GME. Us plebs on average double our money every 7 years and they did it in 1 month. We just don’t know anything about investing. 


My favorite is when you can show they’re wrong yet they’ll say “well that’s not how its done.” An example was some guy was saying a stocks’ yield is a theoretical number and I showed him that it’s annual dividend/share price and he was like “that’s not really how it’s done, the rich don’t calculate it like that.” He was confusing yield on cost and some pseudomath to come to the conclusion that stocks have a 200% dividend yield after 5 years or something like that...so a stock with a 7% yield, you 2x your principal every year after 5 years was his theory. He used like a PeRT equation or something like that, I don’t know, he did the math for me and I just got lost. 


Edit: I think he also assumed if a company raises the dividend by 10% that the stock’s yield also increases by 10%...like I said Idek what he was talking about. He was confusing yield on cost and other things. I don’t know.

I think it was back during the 1929 Wall Street crash. Before that major crash, everyone was hearing about people getting rich off stocks so average people started to join in. This of course drove up prices further and beyond reasonable levels. This is where the famous story was coined: 


> There is a famous story, we don't know if it's true, about how in the late summer of 1929, a shoe-shine boy gave Joe Kennedy stock tips, and Kennedy, being a wise old investor, thought, “If shoe shine boys are giving stock tips, then it's time to get out of the market.”

However what gets me is the verifiably false things people believe. Such as yield. This is a real thing we can define. 


The guy I mentioned in the post, he thought a lot of false things. He thought companies set the dividend yield of a stock and therefore the dividend amount is a theoretical value that changes based on share price. So in his mind if a stock crashes 50% or goes up 50% you still have the receive the same % dividend, therefore the only true way to measure the rate of return was though the number of shares you bought through the DRIP year over year. This is why he thought it was easy to beat the market with his “guaranteed“ rate of return of 13%. 


You and I can both agree that this is wrong....correct? I don’t need to be Warren Buffett to know this is wrong. This is verifiably false. 


Then he was so confident in his conclusion, he basically refused to educate himself on the matter because I’m the stupid one and everyone is investing wrong."

They draw attention to risks that we tend to minimize or forget about, so it's a good idea to consider carefully what they have to say, even if we may end up disagreeing with them.

Since you mentioned Buffet, he is famous for insisting that any investment idea should be challenged in numerous ways, and he is known for always asking \`How might we actually be stupid about this ?'"

I know right. However I also think about it this way. 


1st) People said a $1T market cap was impossible. 


Fun fact: If you adjust for inflation, MSFT back during the dot com bubble didn’t break $1T in today’s money. It got to around $950B in today’s money. 


2nd) People then said $2T market cap was a barrier that couldn’t be done. I assume the next is $3T, but who knows when that barrier will be broken. 


Now I agree with you, how much can a $2T company grow? If it were to double that would be $4T which is insane. I wish we had a magic ball to tell us what would happen but I guess that’s half the fun of stock picking XD"

03/25/2021,stocks,">So I'm trying to focus my portfolio on stocks that are likely to increase over a long period of time.

Remember, the amount a stock increases doesn't matter, what matters is how much it increases in comparison to an index, otherwise you could have just bought an index fund, had less risk, less work, and more return. It doesn't matter if a stock increases over the long run, it matters how much more it increases than the index.

>I just don't know enough now to know the difference between an okay stock and a gamble

Essentially no one does, not even the best fund managers, this is evidenced by the fact that they consistently fail to beat passive index funds. Think to yourself, if even the ""best"" people, people that have studied this their entire lives, can't consistently pick the best stocks, do you think you can?

The best way to make money in the stock market is to invest 60-70% in a US Total Market Index Fund/ETF and 30-40% in International Total Market excluding US Index Funds. Not only is this safer, but you'll also get better returns over the long run, it's the best of both worlds.

I've said this a few times recently but honestly it bears repeating as much as possible. 96% of US stocks do not beat even treasury bills for returns, let alone the indexes, and 40% of stocks see a decline of at least 70% and never recover. You're new to this so I'm just trying to help you out, you're far better off socking your money away in index funds than trying to pick individual stocks, even if those stocks seem like sure things.

Sector ETFs more generally: What drives returns is systematic risk, which is risk that cannot be diversified away, for example buying a single stock is risky, but you are not compensated for that risk because you could get rid of it by buying a lot more different stocks. The risk of the stock market as a whole *is* compensated for, since it cannot be diversified away. The risk of Sector ETFs can be diversified away by buying total market ETFs therefore I would not expect it to provide returns in excess of the total market.

I think most people's lord in the stock market is probably... **money**... and that's far older than ""2021"". 

The best year for investing in hindsight is always a year before if you zoom out on the market chart. That's not 2021, it was around March/April 2020 when you could have quadrupled your money most likely with not too much of luck involved in your picks, as it was a pure bull run since then. Until now, when even the biggest bulls are getting nervous and are kind of pawing the ground, not knowing which way to run. Maybe if we are in 2022 and zoom out on 2021 in hindsight it was a great time again in March/April 2021, who knows.

I've been hit hard and am sitting at +/- 0 right now, barely. I do own some of these sectors, but balanced it out with other reflation trade stuff in Feb, and have been sneered at for mentioning it in some threads similar to this - that has since also gone up... and now down again. And yet it holds the line at around 0 overall. Had I stayed in tech, I would have been brutalized, as is obvious by the few I am holding - ""stupidly"" now as I know in hindsight, since I could also have liquidated them as well with some gains still on the books. 

But I know they'll go up again eventually, so what. I don't need the cash, so they can sit with book losses until they don't anymore.

The best time to invest usually is *right now* if you wanted to stay invested and if you wanted to pick single stocks. If you check your portfolio constantly, see -5% and go to ""OMG panic!"" mode, you should likely forget single stock picking and get a broad sector or even market ETF and sleep soundly.

03/25/2021,stocks,"You mean until retail investors figure out how the system works and stop looking for massive short term gains. 

“There no free lunch.” In every market there’s winners and losers. HFs lost until they won. The first time around retail won huge it was amazing. The second time around the only thing that changed wasn’t some looming squeeze it’s that HFs leveraged their position and knew exactly how the other side would react.

Is it fair, IMHO yes. There was a massive profit available for retail twice now. A lot didn’t take profit or bought in late due to FOMO. Most of the ones who got in late hit a jackpot opportunity to walk clean. A step further I’d argue retail fell victim to the same level of greed that they shame HFs for. Retail was driven by an unrealistic target and tripled down with their potential gains into demand-saturated options.

Full disclosure I’m not a shill nor rich. But volume was down low which was a huge indicator the levels weren’t sustainable. I personally cashed out the second wave at $200 and threw profit into puts because the price didn’t make sense. The ridiculous demand driving the deep OTM options market was pure ignorant greed. Literally I started opening calls less than two weeks out at $400-500 and taking at some points a $40 premium.

GME I hope can be a huge lesson. It’s not that Wall Street is bad or us vs. them, it’s just use common sense. You have to imagine if you were in their shoes would you not tap into an opportunity where you could make money up, down, or any direction?"

Sleepy Joe has been president for a couple of months and you’re already blaming him for FED action taken... during the last administration. Not to mention the FED carries its own dual mandate independent from fiscal policy so in theory it’s a moot point.

Cramer/ CNBC hinted at a rotation back to tech stocks soon I know Cramer is quite the controversial topic and i think that as long as you do your own DD and listen to what he is actually saying to make that fit into your own narrative he throws out some pretty good nuggets. Disney is one of the ones i picked up because of him and its been good to me. He also promoted AMD a lot which many people love and are super long on...

Anyways i was listening to Mad Money from Tuesday 3/23/2021 and it was very subtle but i noticed he mentioned that there will be a rotation back to tech stocks soon. Cramer mentioned around easter is when things rally. I am curious to see what happens 

In addition today and yesterday listening to Fast Money/ Squak i noticed they mentioned the same thing... but in a different way. They mentioned that PE's for ""value"" are slowly  reaching PE's of ""tech"" and that with that people are going to jump back into the tech stocks thinking they are getting a deal now which will effectively cause a rotation back to tech. 

I found this interesting because in the previous weeks they've been promoting value value value and ive been waiting for the hint that we are rotating back. 

What are everyone thoughts?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah that’d be great because I’ve gotten my shit pushed in the past 5 weeks.

03/25/2021,stocks,"I generally watch Cramer just for entertainment because he tends to be very late to parties. But, I do agree with him here because I think the rally of the cyclicals is based quite a bit on optimism and expectation. I’m always one to bet against extremes, and cyclicals (I can’t even call them value because they aren’t anymore) are basically expecting a very fast and smooth reopening. Now we basically see that won’t happen on a global scale. Euro zone is still dealing with covid in a serious way, and I’m willing to bet the Chinese consumer won’t have recovered since the government didn’t prop them up like the US did for its people. 

I just like buying companies that are under the radar and undervalued, and if that happens to be tech nowadays, I’m fine with it."
03/25/2021,stocks,Been holding IBM for many years. This could be a good year  - I hope.
03/25/2021,stocks,"What's neglected when discussing Cramer is  what he does... 

He works for a cable network.. he has an audience. The CEOs who talk to him are as often as not trying to *use him and his audience* for their purpose. 

It's not necessarily Cramer putting out misdirection. 

Love him or hate him, his job is to deliver an audience."

03/25/2021,stocks,"There is truth to what he's saying.

A typical bull market year sees small cap value plays take the lead in January and February.

Such bull market year sees mid- or large-cap growth plays take the lead in November and December."

03/25/2021,stocks,At least for big techs there should be very strong support at current price levels. It’s unlikely for qqq to get much worse than this. Danger is at some qqqj’s stocks.

My thoughts on the specific advice are: “meh”. 

I’m a new investor, investing in picked stocks is a hobby for me, I think long term, and this is not financial advice. 

I anticipate things dragging out awhile. Whenever the market pivots again, I’ll already be in tech and will have averaged down even further. Seeing red for 5 weeks or 6 months is fine for me. No sell, no loss. 🤷🏻‍♂️"

It wasn't as hard hit as tech, but it corrected as well and you had nowhere you could really hide back in the fall if you don't play bear ETFs. 

It wasn't until the third try where it did break higher. It's more like a November to March trend. Only tech fully participated at the same time up to mid-February with the tech indices setting a number of record highs (actually surprising me initially when it started doing so given what had happened in the fall), even though for FAANG outside Google, it was mostly fits and starts instead of them going up consistently."

For Square it has had a solid ROE, has best its expected EPS quarter over quarter, and a positive cash flow. 

I feel like Squares next earnings report will be one that project's it farther ahead.

Granted i think Paypal DD wise is much better in paper i think square will catch up and the PE will come down. Square owns cash app which is huge and they opened an official financial bank. They also are in C r y p t o which will pay off for them. Plus square is a huge in small buisnesses with their little device that plugs in and allows credit cards to swipe plus they have stand alone credit card machines.

Now a position in a S P A C or something else i absolutely could understand why you'd sell and run but a company whos been around for year and has a solid financials... it makes no sense to sell unless you need cash.

Thoughts from this crew?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Merger with BCEI. 

That particular halt is long enough to be a news halt and the merger was a possibility.

03/25/2021,stocks,"I have two. Both charge for the buy and the sell.

RBC is $10CA per Canadian stock trade and $10US for American Stock. The trading platform is very basic.

Questrade is cheaper for major stocks and worse for pennies. I don't use it much but the trading platform is way better than RBC.

For both, I convert money to US funds and never cross funds. The exchange fee is 3% each way (6% total). It's a deal breaker if I have to pay $20 plus 6% on each buy/sell pair.

I aim for profits of a few hundred dollars to keep the trade charges at a reasonable percentage. It makes the minimum investment a little higher."
03/25/2021,stocks,"A minor drawback of Questrade for NG (compared with RBC) is that they won't do the journal operation (e.g. DLR to DLR.U) for you immediately, but wait 2 days for the trade to settle. And you have to wait for a chat slot to set it up."

2021-03-25 04:39:13,stocks,"Bullish DD on Canadian Pacific Raliway ($CP) - some bearish points too  First DD, so I'll try to do my best! I only have a small position in this, 1 share, since it's expensive ($356) but wanted to share it.

&#x200B;

Bullish points:

* Entered a merger agreement with Kansas City Southern (another railway) to purchase them for US$29 billion. This will be the first direct railway that connects the US, Canada, and Mexico. Canadian Pacific Railway stock dipped from $385.87 to around $353 on this news they were purchasing the Kansas City Southern railway. I think this is a good buy-in opportunity as I think it'll recover slowly in the next few weeks or so.
* In the last 1 year, it has gone from $206.82 to $356.10 and in the last 6 months, it has gone from $300.39 to $356.10 (it was $385.87 at its all time high before dipping on the KCS railway purchase). Doesn't necessarily mean that it'll be the same in the future but generally, it has been a bullish stock during the COVID-19 pandemic and will probably continue to grow as the pandemic is over
* According to wsj ([https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CP/research-ratings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CP/research-ratings)  
), it has bullish price targets. High price target is $591, median price target is $495, and low price target is $460 **(currently $356).**
* Quarterly net income gained 20.7% in Q4 2020 compared to the same period Q4 2019, and also set an all-time record
* Their board recently approved a five-for-one split of their shares on Jan. 27, 2021. They will seek shareholder approval at its annual meeting on April 21st and I imagine that they'll probably win with the majority of shareholders approving. While stock splits don't change the fundamental price/values of a company, it definitely makes it more accessible for people to purchase the stock (if they don't have fractional shares on their platform) and even if they had an option to get fractional shares, the psychological effect of seeing a stock at a lower price will be more encouraging to some.
* This is just a personal prediction of mine but imo, I do think that trade will start to increase as COVID-19 starts to go away and that there'll be less trade disputes over what Canada's importing/exporting to the US.

&#x200B;

Bearish Points:

* The Kansas City Southern merger deal is great for $CP in the long run but what if the Canadian or American governments decide to cancel the merger due to some antitrust laws or something? I don't think it'll happen because there are other major railways in the US/Canada and this merger doesn't make Canadian Pacific Railway a monopoly/even close to a monopoly in terms of railways.
* Yearly income was the same in 2019 and 2020 - around $2.44 billion Canadian dollars (though you could argue that during COVID-19, they faced some challenges initially at the start of the pandemic). Someone has commented that CP was never given approval in their last couple of times to merge with a US railway so I have to do more research on that and you should take this into consideration. 
* Current unstable market conditions and general bearish sentiment (I'm a bull though) currently could decrease the price of the stock. However, it's honestly been holding up pretty nicely in the month of March, where a lot of stocks have decreased or hasn't moved that much up. Except, until they bought the Kansas City Southern railway, where they dropped about $27 from their all time high. Other than that, was going up/stable up to that point during this month.

What are the pros and cons of what you are recommending?
03/25/2021,stocks,Fidelity and td Ameritrade are kind of the big 2 right now
03/25/2021,stocks,"Fidelity, here’s my quick synopsis:

Pros: 
- Available in the US and 25 more countries, INCLUDING Australia. You can either settle your equity and stocks in the USD or your local AUD currency.

- Capital worries? None whatsoever. They’re heavily funded for any situation. Ever since GameStop, for example, rose to fame on the market with it’s insane volatility, Fidelity not once stopped you from buying shares or options. Most other brokerages did stop you from buying because of “liquidity” issues, as they like to call it. I expect no issues whatsoever regarding Fidelity’s capital amount overall as a company.

- Mobile app is very informative with learning modules, simple and advanced charting with every indicator, and is very secure. Mobile app also has a live chat/help feature.

- Able to trade internationally on stocks, ETF’s, and Mutual Funds.

- Comes with Fidelity’s free desktop trading app. I personally never used it though.

- 0% commissions on buying/selling stocks. $0.65 per contract for option trading (not the end of the world).

- Customer service is great! 

Cons:

- If you’re used to Robinhood, there is a slight learning curve to the mobile app, once you get the hang of it by watching some tutorials it’s not bad at all. It’s actually pretty intuitive with all of the info right there for you. Might seem daunting at first, but trust me, it’s worth it.

Other than that, you would be in good hands with Fidelity."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m a big fan of TD Ameritrade. Fidelity and Scwhab are good options too. I’d avoid Robinhood and Webull and similar brokerages at all costs. They make their profit by more freely issuing margin and selling off their trade volume to a larger brokerage, Citadel. Basically RH pools orders together until there’s a sufficient volume to execute. That’s why they were caught up in a $150m settlement for lost profits to their clients.

Can’t speak for user experience, but TD’s thinkorswim platform is great. Little annoying at times but overall I like it.

EDIT: There’s nothing wrong with opening an account on those two only to claim your free signup bonus."
03/25/2021,stocks,Fidelity is good unless you're using thier app. Their phone app is absolutely trash
03/25/2021,stocks,"NZ here - I know a few locally use TD and some IBKR (myself included). Apparently the sign up for TD is quite onerous, while I didn't think IBKR was too bad. I feel like the learning curve can be quite steep, but you can always do paper trades (fake money) until you work it out.

I had previously used Hatch, which I liked, very accessible and easy to get started with, but limited if you want to do anything more than simple stock trades. Possibly similar to Commsec?

I'm unsure if fidelity is viable for us, I haven't really heard of anyone using it (but they may be?)

Unsure if this helps, but should be slightly closer to home at least!"
03/25/2021,stocks,Robinhood
03/25/2021,stocks,"TDAmeritrade ThinkOrSwim app. I like the simplicity of Webull, but I've been fucked over by them buying at too high."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not for your question but for stocks and etfs, you should check out self wealth, Aus broker I use as an Australian, cheapest brokerage for owning real assets under a HIN, it’s limited on international trade but it’s where I buy most of my SPY.AX for investing in the SnP500. I also have commsec but will only use it when self wealth can’t do what I want"
03/25/2021,stocks,Would I be able to use them from Australia? And what are the pros and cons from your point of view?
03/25/2021,stocks,thanks I will look into it
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I'll have a look at these 3"
03/25/2021,stocks,Agreed ^ .Seems like companies realize how much money they make off of order flow. Definitely stay away from RH. Many good reviews on ToS
03/25/2021,stocks,I've heard a lot about this one in the news and from WSB. What would you say are the pros and cons?
03/25/2021,stocks,"I must say, I really enjoy Webull’s desktop app for chart use. I don’t use them as my broker though."
03/25/2021,stocks,I believe fidelity is not sure about td ameritrade .  But fidelity has access to a wide range of assets and they have fee free mutual funds. The fidelity app is a little nice than  td ameritrade I believe. The desktop versions are pretty similar for both. Td has better charting imo. I think Td Ameritrade is better suited for trading and Fidelity is better suited for investing if that makes sense.
03/25/2021,stocks,He's just messing with you. Robinhood is trash.
03/25/2021,stocks,I was just joking I use vanguard and am very happy with it
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I'll definitely look into both and see which one is better suited to me I guess"
03/25/2021,stocks,"It doesn't.

Ameritrade is owned by Schwab.

Ameritrade has at least three different trading platforms and Schwab has two (the desktop and mobile systems are totally different)."
03/25/2021,stocks,Haha glad one person got my joke
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks, and yes that does seem to be the general consensus"
03/25/2021,stocks,I will look into vanguard too. Sounds like Robinhood is one of the worst from the way people are talking about it lol glad you were joking.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah that one upvote you see, it's from me. Haha"

Don't just FOMO because you can get burned (sometimes you can get lucky too). Growth prospects are just as good as financials. How can a company grow if they are not financially reaping the rewards!"

Due diligence is not a concept unique to investing.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Wow, nice job. Have you made money with this in the short term? Or are macro/outside factors messing things up? Is there anything that's not overvalued + distorted by the monetary policy / crazy markets?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thank you! My personal plan is to use it for short term (1-10 day) swing trading, with a 'target deck' of stable/growing/solvent & reasonably-valued companies. I just started making these, 1-2 companies a day, and I'm almost up to 50 companies.


The macro factors are making things interesting. I like researching a new company and figuring out how covid/closures impacted them and how they deal with it. 


The ""weighted P/"" values I have basically take the past valuations of a company and apply them to the most recent quarter. It can help identify bubbles, or when a price spikes down into 'unreasonable' levels. As far as that goes, there are a lot of tech companies that are overpriced, but still plenty of opportunities elsewhere in the market. 


Whether the entire market is overvalued, that's a question above my pay grade."
2021-03-25 04:18:34,stocks,"Are stocks bought and sold between individuals or the brokerage? How does the price go up and down? Say I buy 1 Apple stock on Charles Schwab for the market price of $200. Did that come from someone else selling the stock for $200 (that’s what I figure) or did I buy it from Schwab? If it’s between people, than that means for every buy there is a sell, in which case it seems the supply and demand would always be an equilibrium. I figure supply and demand is ultimately the reason for how the price moves, but how exactly does that work? More people offer to sell the stock so the price goes down even before they the sale goes through? How is it that there’s always buyers and sellers available? Is there ever a time where basically nobody wants to sell apple so buyers can’t buy, or nobody wants to buy apple so sellers can’t sell? If it’s through the brokerage, how is it getting all those stocks?

If the market price is exactly 200 and I buy 1 share how much would the new market price move up or down? Perhaps we have to know how many shares their are in total? What is that called when I look it up?  

I’ve been doing plenty of stock trading lately but I’m realizing idk how this is all going down beneath the surface. Details on how exactly this all works is much appreciated!"
03/25/2021,stocks,They are traded between buyers and sellers whether that been individuals or institutions.  Most trades are done through limit orders not market orders and those limits set the price.  If you say you are willing to buy something with a limit of $200 and someone else is wiling to sell it for $200 or less it will trade at $200.  However if no one is willing to sell it for less that $201 then no trades happen until someone gives in and agrees to buy it for $201 and then $201 becomes the new price.  The same thing happens on the way down where someone is willing to sell it lower than the current price because no one else is willing to buy it at the current price.  If you place a market order you are saying you want to buy/sell no matter what the price is so it will trade at the closest bid/ask which is just someone else's limit order.  Supply and demand set the price because of more people want to buy than sell the buyers will give in and pay higher prices.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It’s like electrical theory, no one actually knows how it works."
03/25/2021,stocks,"There's many parties/players involved in the stock market; and some entities play multiple roles (for example, a brokerage may also be a market maker and hedge fund). I'm aware of the following below:

1) retail investors - people like you who use brokerages to perform trades. Retail investor trading only make up between about 15% to 30% of the market transactions (ref: [https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2021-01-29/factbox-the-us-retail-trading-frenzy-in-numbers](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2021-01-29/factbox-the-us-retail-trading-frenzy-in-numbers) ).

2) dark pools - performs algorithmic trading on large transactions (and additionally hides ""bids"" and ""asks""). This is a service that is provided for wealthy clients (e.g., hedge funds).

3) market makers - use algorithmic trading to create liquidity in the stock market. They make money on the spread between the bid and ask. They engage in the practice of payment-for-order-flow, because it helps them determine the ""bid"" and ""ask"" price. Note, they may hold excess shares.

4) institutions - hedge funds, mutual funds, banks, etc."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Long story short there are different types of orders when you buy a stock. For example if you buy at market there’s some wiggle room in the price and is executed at the quickest time of delivery, but your price isn’t entirely locked in. Limit orders you set your price floor or ceiling and are put into a transaction queue until the underlying value gets to that point. Generally brokers will protect you to match your order with the closest available one. 

So let’s say you try to buy a single share of AAPL at $200, you’ll likely just get on the first available purchase order that meets sufficient volume to execute. You won’t pay $200, but I wouldn’t make it a practice of it. This could become a VERY dangerous practice if you were to buy in large volumes on a smaller less active share. The ticker reflects the last transaction price. If demand is low and price comes down to meet supply it’s red and vice versa. If the price were precisely $200 and you bought for $200 nothing would change. Changes reflect a differential in what’s being paid and what’s asked.

**TLDR** At a very fundamental level a stock’s price is really only driven by supply and demand.

There’s a lot of interesting theory behind it depending on your interest in mathematics and statistics. A lot of the terms thrown out so often now, <insert squeeze or sell off here> are just edge cases of extreme activity of limit demands and supply. This is why I’ve found GameStop interesting as an example. Theoretically there’s a limit to any share value relative to the underlying equity, growth, implied risk, sentiment, and any other factor. Then if you abstract it a bit to a buyer and seller level this changes at an entirely different level since many people are deterred by a stock like Berkshire or Amazon with high cost. 

As an example of a completely recalled estimate I made a few weeks ago so numbers won’t be perfect. At $350 a share and around 70m in outstanding shares with ~$6.5bn in revenue GME’s market cap to revenue ratio was 3.79. As a contrast, Amazon is around $3.1k with around 440 million shares floating (which don’t rotate as often) and $386.1bn in revenue so a ratio of around 3.526. Effectively GME was more valued than Amazon without any of the intrinsics. When people boast pipe dreams and expectations of $1000+ this is why I found it interesting that people valued a company well beyond that ratio. There are definitely other factors, but at it’s core I find that to be an indicator of a price limit. Nobody looking solely at business expectations and growth prospects would value the two companies equally."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Sometimes you'll trade directly with another retail trader. Other times you'll trade against an institution, like a hedge fund. 

But more often than not, a market maker is on the other side of your trade.

03/25/2021,stocks,Your broker sends it to the exchange where the market makers fill orders and then your broker makes the change to your account. Much of it is done very fast electronically
03/25/2021,stocks,"A brokerage is exactly what the name suggest, a broker. It pairs a seller with a buyer. For pairing, you can look at volume. Obviously with higher volume it will be easier to pair buyer with a seller. The bid/ask price is where you can see the price people are willing to buy/sell at

Yes if there are no buyers and sellers then the stock price will remain the same. For your example in Apple there will always be a buyer and seller at the right price"
03/25/2021,stocks,Pick up the book “stocks for dummies” it will teach you all the basics rather quickly.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Your order to buy a stock can be executed by your broker transmitted to market makers or through their own inventory.  On your trade confirmations, it should state whether it was an agency transactions (sent order to market makers) or a principal transaction (firm's inventory).   Either way, they are supposed to get you the best possible price.  As for the movement of the price, it all depends on supply and demand.   More sell orders, stock goes down.  More buy orders, stock goes up."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Stock brokers pair sellers with buyers, where stock dealers(market makers) have some amount of shares so they can sell and buy, which is probably required by regulation. Stock dealers are like car dealers that have new cars in their dealership, they have shares in their account. Those dealers are the investment banks that help companies to do IPO. For example, Fidelity is a client (institution client), it also functions like brokerage, but I don’t think Fidelity is a dealer. GS, JPM, etc are dealers as well as brokerage, they are also institution clients(mutual funds, ETF, etc)."
03/25/2021,stocks,"If Schwab makes a market in that ticker, you may trade with them. Or you may trade with another market maker, or anyone in the world.

For every buy there is a sell. Market makers are not inventing it out of thin air, and their need to hedge or lay off or cover the positions they end up in to make the market constitutes one of the largest supply-and-demand drivers.

If there were no market makers there would be many more times when stocks would be illiquid (nobody to trade with).

When you buy 1 share ""at market"" you are accepting the bid/ask on the order book. If that is 1 cent away from the last price, you move the price a penny; if it is a dollar away, you move it a dollar. If it is 10,000% away, that's how far you move it.

If you make a limit trade, and someone fills your order, and your quoted price was different from the last price, that also moves the price.

There is no pricing algorithm. The price listed is simply the last price paid by a buyer to a seller, whatever one quoted and the other executed the trade at.

So when you trade, don't look at the last price. Look at the bid and ask to see what you're really trading at.

Now, way down below the surface is the clearing and settlement system. When a trade is made, each side has 2 days to deliver cash or shares to settle the trade. But in the electronic system virtually every share is always in the clearinghouse (DTCC) and only the identities of their owners change in ledger entries. The cash really does move, though. The market tells the clearinghouse who traded, and when the seller's broker gets the cash from the buyer's broker they tell the clearinghouse they got it, and the clearinghouse changes the ledger for the shares.

Also, often the shares aren't in your name, they're ""in street name,"" meaning your broker is the name in the clearinghouse ledger (and the investor relations ledger at the company that issued the stock), and the broker keeps track of which customers notionally own what portion of the shares. That further simplifies the processing by the market and clearinghouse and takes a ton of risk out of the system by relying on the broker's resources instead of a million individuals'."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Schwab, TD etc are brokers. They broker a transaction, but the actual transactions happen through market makers (there are three big ones, as far as I know). So no, I don't believe you are trading directly with another buy/seller, but it doesn't matter. The concept is the same.

As for what determines the price, it's the same as anything: supply and demand. The more buyers there are for something, the higher the price. More sellers, price goes down."

You bought it from someone selling it at $200. Charles Schwab likely routed your order to a market maker/exchange for execution.

>More people offer to sell the stock so the price goes down even before they the sale goes through?

No. The sale has to go through before it can move the price. 

>How is it that there’s always buyers and sellers available?

Market makers can and will intervene to create liquidity in a stock. They buy when people sell and sell when people buy. 

>Is there ever a time where basically nobody wants to sell apple so buyers can’t buy, or nobody wants to buy apple so sellers can’t sell?

Nope. Apple is one of the most liquid stocks on the Nasdaq, so you will have little/no trouble finding a buyer/seller.

>What is that called when I look it up? 

Shares outstanding."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Mmm so really limit orders is how I should think of all this. So if there’s more buy orders than sell orders the price goes up because sellers end up giving in to the buy orders? 

So let’s say a bunch of buyers have limit orders at 199 and there’s only a few sellers at 201, I don’t imagine buyers would get it cheaper when there’s many of them? Perhaps my example isn’t realistic, but what would be realistic in that situation?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Haha!
03/25/2021,stocks,I know how both work. Actually.
03/25/2021,stocks,That is pretty much it but really it is a matter of who is more desperate.  Do you wait for it to come down and miss buying?  Do you wait for it to go up and miss selling?  So theoretically it is who flinches first not which side has more but usually knowing there are more buyers than sellers will give the sellers more resolve and the buyers less.
03/25/2021,stocks,"If there's a bunch of buy limit orders at 199 and a bunch of sell limit orders at 201, in a closed system nothing would happen. No trades would execute. Basically a gridlock. 

But the thing is there are so many people trading that there will also be a plethora of market buyers and sellers for a stock like aapl. Every second or so there will be people placing market orders which means ""buy this for the cheapest I can"" or ""sell this as fast as possible to the highest bidder""

I understand your questions in your post , but the thing is there are so many transactions going on that it's hard to analyze like you are trying.

Rather, think of it this way. Millions of orders are entered into the system. Some market buys, some limit buys, some market sells, some limit sells. And then a giant software system runs the analysis and pairs buyers with sellers and determines which stocks exchange hands. It's too big of a system to work it through on paper and pencil.

If youve ever sold a large amount of stock at market you'll see this in action. Sell like 500 shares of AAPL and you'll see ""37 executed at 200, 28 executed at 199.6, 62 executed at 199.2"" etc. You're basically pacman ""eating"" the buys on the way down. And the opposite for buying a large amount of stock. Buy 500 of any stock and likely you will get shares for sublle penny differences.

There are also market makers who buy and sell anything, and are paid to do so, to provide liquidity."
03/25/2021,stocks,It's similar to the south park episode where they explain where the simpsons show ideas come from.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Also, how do differing amounts work? Say I want to by 1 stock at 200 and someone else is selling 100 of those stocks at 200. Do I buy just one of his?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I see, so let’s say tons of people want Apple for about 200, then there’s more buyers and less sellers, then I guess the sellers get away with selling for higher prices (201,202 etc) since there’s not many sellers and many willing buyers. Once people buy for 201 and 202, that becomes the new standard market prices so sellers start offering at 203?

Can I see all this on Schwab? Can I see limit orders and sell orders and then choose say a buy order I like and by that sell order?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Mmm thanks this is really insightful! So if I want to buy 500 apple shares, I’m probably getting it from many different people doing sell orders at slightly varying prices? Same with sales? And since there’s so many people involved we can be sure our orders will execute and not be left having bought only 499 shares when we asked for 500?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Yes.  And if he is only selling one and you are buying 200 you will get get a partial fill for one at that price and depending on your limit may fill the rest at a slightly higher price based on the next ask in line or otherwise you will be the new bid at that price for 199 shares that may fill if someone else puts in an order that meets it.  If you have access to Level 2 quotes you can see all of the orders and the quantities.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Any quote will have bid/ask/last bid is the highest limit buy order outstanding and the ask is the lowest limit sell order outstanding.  If you have level 2 quotes you can see the whole order chain of all the orders.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Exactly. If you buy 500 shares at market, you will very likely see several ""tax lots"" in your account. Each lot will have some number of shares and the price paid for that lot. For a very popular stock like aapl the prices will be close to identical. 

Also note that liquidity is critical here, which is a result of the stock popularity. You've used aapl in your example and questions which is extremely popular stock. Tons of volume.

If a stock has little volume and trading activity, the ""gaps"" between each of those buys or sells, could be dollars instead of pennies.. Also market orders may very dangerous! Liquidity and volume makes prices sane. If you lack volume then the gaps in market orders can get out of hand quickly. 

All this is also why it's scary to place a market order before the market opens or the night before. You might get Effed at the open because the price tanks etc"
03/25/2021,stocks,"BTW the answer to one of your other questions is ""float"". Float is the number of shares of the company that's publicly traded. IE a stock might be 70% publicly traded because original founders own 30% of it.

Lately with the GME nonsense ""% of float that is short"" has been a popular metric. That means what % of the float %	are borrowed (for shorting)"

But, most of there revenues (60ish%?) come from humira and many competitors are developing and about to sell their own version of humira which is going to rape ABBVIE financially. Thats why they are prioritizing their cash now to undergo millions of dollars worth of construction and revamp research, development, and production to create the next big thing.

ALLERGEN

They recently purchased 60% of Allergen... further investigation required by yourself. too lazy, last minute edits.

PLUS LOOK WHO OWNS THE STOCK

Biggest institutional holders: vanguard, blackrock, JP Morgan Chase, Berkshire Hathaway, etc.

Biggest Mutual Fund Holders: 
Vanguard total and 500
SPDR S+P500
Fidelity500 Index Fund
I shares Core S+P 500 ETF
Etc.


I'm done writing basic DD, this took way too long and I'm just a dumb GME ape who just got into stock but love em like my kittens. But lastly, I think this is a longer hold and there may be a better time to buy, like after competitors start selling versions of HUMIRA and the stock hits harder, idk any of these time-frames this is prior research but valid nonetheless. OK BYE tell me what you think.

tl;dr this company made 45 billion last year, keeps increasing revenues and spending BILLIONS on upgrades to r&d. longer hold but very young company (2013) already making billions and many big name institutional, and mutual fund holders invested heavily recently also works globally to determine efficiency of COVID-19 treatments while managing supply chains, NBD.  Do your own dd I aint no financial talker."
03/25/2021,stocks,I’ve got 20 shares of ABBV. I think they’re a steal at $100. 5% dividend too
03/25/2021,stocks,"Bought some 320 shares right after it spun off ABT in 2013... sitting on ~300% gains and I think a 15% YoC dividend so I don't even look at the share price or the fundamentals anymore as it's just 1% to 1.5% of the portfolio. I remember back in 2013, 2016 was portrayed as a humira patent cliff"
03/25/2021,stocks,"On a different level, I worked on a construction project for them.  Great people.  Super well organized.  They have meetings, for pre-meetings, to prepare for real meetings.  They are a very dialed in company."
03/25/2021,stocks,Fun fact about the “other companies selling HUMIRA” (or any biologic medication that is) is technically they won’t be “generics” but a biosimilar and unlike a generic medication there is no law indicating the price must be cheaper than the brand name product. So yes there will be more competition once the patent is up BUT the ABBVIE brand medication will not become obsolete like many other name brand medications.
03/25/2021,stocks,Or just hold the companies that hold the companies
03/25/2021,stocks,"I went with ABT instead given their more diversified business and the risk to ABBV of drugs going off patent in the next couple of years. Are you accounting for that in your DD? In other words, what does their product pipeline look like?"

03/25/2021,stocks,"If you want to buy 5 shares of Stock X at $10, place a limit order for 5 shares at $10. If you place a market order for 5 shares you could end up paying more than $10 depending on what people are selling it at."
03/25/2021,stocks,Simply put yes kind of. There are a few different types of orders you can place to buy a stock. The most basic being a market order which will be executed at the current market price. However there may be slippage and the price may change so you may not actually buy the stock at the price you wanted. If you want more information look up order types and placing orders. Hope this help and anyone  feel free to correct me if Im wrong.
03/25/2021,stocks,"When you look at a stock quote there are actually three prices.  The bid, ask and last.  The last is considered the price so in your case $10.  This is the last price anyone bought/sold the stock but for you to buy it for $10 someone else would have to be willing to sell it for $10.  That may not be the case (this is what causes stocks to go up).  The ask is the lowest price anyone is currently willing to sell it at.  If you put in a market order you will by it at the ask price no matter if that is $1,000.  Obviously that is not likely on a $10 stock but could happen.  If you place a limit order then you will buy it at the current ask as long as your limit is higher than the current ask and if it is not then you will be a bid at the new price.

Example:

Bid 9:55 Last 10.00 Ask 10.10

If you placed a market order or a limit above 10.10 you would buy it for that.  If you placed a limit order for 10.03 you would not buy it but the current bid would now be you and change to 10.03.  The same thing is true for selling.  If you want to sell you would have to place a limit below the current bid so if someone placed a sell with the limit below your ask of 10.03 you would then buy it at 10.03.  In most cases either the bid or ask will usually be at the last and the spread (difference between them) is usually only a penny or two but for low volume stocks the spread can be much larger as in my example."

03/25/2021,stocks,Basically yes. But it gets a little tricky. You have to look at the bid ask spread. Remember it is a market after all. Then there is slippage. Then you have to account for broker fees. Bottom line expect to get shaved somehow on each order by your broker. The easiest way to visualize this is that you buy a stock for $10 and once the order is filled it’s worth $9.75 in your account balance.
03/25/2021,stocks,"That’s pretty much it. There are variables that you can play with, I.e. LIMIT order so you can get the share for your target price, provided the stock price falls into your limit and execute. Don’t forget to factor in brokerage fees for the trade."

As a beginner ETFs and big name companies you have some knowledge about are your friends, especially if you don’t like research, math, or reading.

Stock A falls 10%.  One of two things will happen based on my orders. 

Stock continues falling. I renter the position when it bounces back using a 1% or $ amount trailing buy. If it falls say 20% I saved 10% and am climbing back up with everyone else to who took a full 20% bath. The money I save not riding it all the way down allows me to increase my holdings in it or take another position. 

Stock does a rapid recovery after hitting my stop like your Apple example. Buy market order is triggered 5% or so below my original exit and I'm back into the position exactly where I started and not any worse for the wear. 

Get the notification and set the condition order back into place 🤷‍♀️...or wheel it if you really don't want to be that fine tuned"

2021-03-25 03:43:02,stocks,"How do we capitalize on the biggest after-hours gainers? I see that there is a website that reveals all the highest and lowest performing after-hour traded stocks. I was wondering if a person could be successful in purchasing a call for a stock that's gained the most since closing time, since the Call Option's price may not have adjusted from the previous day's close to the next day at 9:30 AM ET, since the option markets are not active. 

Here's an example of what I mean: [Intel's price appreciated by 6.6% after 4:00 PM ET on Tuesday, March 23rd.](https://imgur.com/a/2qVoKUu) The option prices are still, from my understanding, going to be based on March 23rd's price fluctuation, which was minimal, and therefore, the option prices should be relatively low. However, I use this 6.6% price gain to my advantage: I quickly put a BID for a Call Option for Strike Price = $65.  In the morning of Wednesday, March 24th at 9:30 AM, if my BID was within the range of the Bid-Ask spread, there's a great chance that my order would execute, and I'm the owner of a relatively cheap Call Option for a stock who's price increased by 6.6% but who's underlying option doesn't reflect this increase. 

A few minutes later, the call options increase dramatically.

Could a person captitalize on the biggest after-hour gainers in this manner?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Not likely unless someone wasn't paying attention.  The bid/ask should adjust before market open to the new price and your order would not execute.  Your order would only execute if your bid was above the current ask when the market opened and that assumes they wouldn't have increased their ask based on the after hours movement which is highly unlikely.
03/25/2021,stocks,you're very unlikely to get filled during that split second it takes for option prices to adjust to new underlying price
03/25/2021,stocks,"Options are priced on an order book like stocks.

If the stock moves because of a thin book, the options may move, or the MMs may just empty the book and let you decide what to offer.

If the offers on the options book don't change as fast as the stock price does, you might get a bargain. That's their fault for being slow.

But remember, you may not be the only player, and if your market order gets through a nanosecond after the other guy's, you'll be paying the next price in the book, which could be on the moon."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You may be able to occasionally ""snipe"" an option but its rare.

Ex. Someone is either happy with their gains (green day) or trying to paper hands (red day) and sells at a price above the Ask price but selects ""Good till closed"" instead of day.

Aftermarket delivers a massive swing overnight but that lazy trader doesn't adjust the ask price so you snipe it early morning (If your broker didn;t snipe it first and they do).

Essentially you have to hope that ask price is in the magical zone between what your market maker sets as the algo-arbitrage buypoint on one side and the buyers Ask above market at previous days close.

If you bid higher than the previous days asking price and ""catch"" their ask price (without the value being within the algo buy zone of the market maker).

**TL;DR**   
For an option snipe (buying an option at greater than its intrinsic value) you need an alignment of 4 things; a lazy trader that sat an ask point above the previous market ask and was lazy enough to be ""good till close"", an after market swing large enough to make that ask price be lower than the actual value, the value must be lower than your market brokers algorithm for automatic arbitrage buys, and you must have the highest bid on the option.  


**Ending comments:**

SO it CAN happen but will be extremely rare.

Things that up your chances: Large aftermarket swings, looking for options on meme stocks or other stocks with shit noob or lazy traders, a good market platform with shitty automatic arbitrage buys (Chase YouInvest), and capital to que up lots of pre-market trades with potential, options with high open interest (lots to buy) but low volume (not many people bought) for the previous day.

The only platform I have been successful with this is Chase YouInvest. Their options are extremely limited BUT their arbitrage buying is dogshit. I have sniped two options for less than their intrinsic value on HUNDREDS of attempts.

I found the best luck Queuing RIGHT at market open.  I found this ""strategy"" completely by accident and have tried it on Tastytrade and Chase YouInvest, hundreds of times. I have only been successful twice and both were on Chase YI.

Neither were very large jumps and one quickly disintegrated at market open but both were profitable.

EDIT: FInal thoughts. I still try this on mornings I wake up too early since I've hit twice. However, the labor for searching them out, bidding on multiples, canceling them all after the options prices adjust, and tying up my settled cash on moonshot plays is a lot of work for only for a small payout.

The bright side is that it costs nothing but time as the money is just held, not spent and failing costs nothing (if your bids are not taken, no cost)\_."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Ohhh....so does a computer determine the option prices or does the markets determine the price of the options?  I was thinking that the prices are determined by people, and therefore, you could take advantage of people not pricing the option very well. For example, some people may sell their second-hand car for well below MSRP, and I was thinking that the option market is the same way."
03/25/2021,stocks," market makers are algos that decide the price of everything
  
there have been some reported cases of a mispriced option but those are very rare and generally, market makers will instantly eat up that arbitrage so you have a very low chance of being able to capitalize on something like that"

2021-03-25 03:14:42,stocks,"Anyone else not using limit trades at all? I always buy/sell stocks on the market price. I know it’s irrational but I do it anyway. 

My reason? When I decide to buy or sell something, I want it done ASAP. If the stock goes up or down a few basis points, I don’t really care; I am a long term investor. But psychologically, I don’t like to have limit trades ‘hanging’ out there, when I have no idea if they will execute this afternoon or 6 months from now, or never. 

Anyone else do this or is it just me?"
03/25/2021,stocks,I only use limit orders in pre market because Fidelity makes you.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You can put your limit buy over the market price and it will execute at the market price.   Yes a limit order will execute at the market price when you set your limit intentionally high.  

I do this all the time.   Yes, I'm only buying 10 shares of something with a $300 share price so a ten penny difference would cost me a dollar.   So I set the limit price 2p cents high and it immediately executes.   Easy.

03/25/2021,stocks,"That's dumb. I just check the price, e. g. $DIS at 194.3, and I put in a limit order at 194.2, that way it doesn't get filled at $190 or the likes."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Nah, I don't see any reason to go for a market order. 

If you're not bothered about a slight price change, isn't it safer to put in a limit order slightly above market price (above ask on buying, below bid on selling)? It'll still execute on market price but you have the safety of your limit."
03/25/2021,stocks,Never use market order with options though and low cap stocks.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I use market buys for anything long term. I do limits on cheaper stocks though when the price movement matter more. But like buying a share of VTI, why would I set a limit."
03/25/2021,stocks,"100% limit at all times. even if I just straight input the bid. a market order will never give you the best price if there is even a hint of volatility. you are a tasty bit of red meat for the market makers in our era of free trading. you are already getting not quite the best bid-ask, why make it worse?

I get your point of not sweating pennies, particularly on the long term. but it is trivial effort to type in a number at the current bid if you want it fast. You can also set the limit to expire that day as well. So the downside is nil, and the upside is I minimize the free money people are scalping off of me."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that is what limited order is for. Also, if you own a hundreds of millions of shares, selling or buying large amount will cause price to fluctuate, sometime in a not trivial way."

\> Edit 2: And please explain to everyone how you get a **”guaranteed”** rate of return of 13%.

T hasn't missed a divvy in 70+ years...

\> Edit: on mine it shows T had an annual rate of return of 2.8% from 1995 to today. So I think you’re just pulling this 13% out of your butt.

The 13% comes from turning 2100 shares into 6840 shares and they pay $2/share per year. This happens regardless of share price.  Getting $2/share with 6840 shares is about 13k/year.  If the share price is .50, and you get $2 share and you have 6840 shares, you still get $13k/year, you just have an awesome tax writeoff.

\>  On the ex date, the share price drops by the amount of the dividend. This is why there’s no logical basis by which you can justify your preference for dividends over selling shares. I’ll say this for the millionth time: you can own 100% of $90k or you can own 90% of $100k.

That's why I got into T now. If they keep the current dividend (and they haven't missed in decades or dropped it) and it keeps the current price, it'll be about a 70% annual return in 30 years.  I'm not expecting it to quite that high but that's the best case scenario.

The high dividend blue chips generally maintain the same dividend and trade sideways, so there isn't the same variation as happens with the stock you're talking about but the price should adjust if they raise or lower it.

Plus, selling covered calls will increase the compounding, even if I only make .25/call.

No, I said the $2/year doesn't change.  You said the % and share price matters for some reason.

> So you only care about the shares when calculating rate of return?

Yes.  $2/year pays the same regardless of share price.  The only way that changes when you pull dividends is from quantity of shares.  After 26 years you'll have on a 10k investment in T 684 shares with a current return of about 1300.  Share price is just a tax write off.

> But see. You told me in that post if you compound at 7%....right? After 30 years it works out to be 13% annually?

Yes.  I said at 7% and a flat price, you'd get about 50%/year after 30 years on T current rates.

Guys."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Idk. I have the opposite thesis. Tech companies got a huge boost from everyone having to suddenly transition remote. I know families buying multiple computers that never had one.  For that reason alone tech is due for a correction back to normal.

NFTs-
A collection of digital art from an unknown artist sold for 69 million via NFT. If you don't know this new emerging market i encourage you to check it out. 

From Benzinga
-----------
NFTs Coming: Playboy was attracted to the NFT space given its huge collection of content and the economics of being able to monetize on the initial and each subsequent sale. Kohn told viewers that Playboy has a 68-year-old archive of content that could be valuable in the NFT space.

“That’s a perfect example of a new revenue stream that has emerged and really leveraged this phenomenal IP we have,” Kohn said.
-----------

From the earnings call yesterday from Chief Brand Officer, Rachel Webber-
""Lastly, we are sitting on almost 70 years of the most incredible and iconic art and photography. We are actively working on our non-fungible tokens or NFT, and digital collectible strategy to enter the space in a thoughtful way, designed for long-term growth and community adoption. We are thrilled by the runway ahead and the wealth of opportunities afforded us by our priceless intellectual property.""

Kohn on fox news stated today that there will be an announcement soon regarding NFTs and it's not just their 68 year old archive that will be utilized. He started throwing out some of the most influential artists of our time that have collaborated with Playboy and are available for NFTs. This is the hottest sector on the market right now and the only sector that is completely ignoring the volitility of the overall market currently. 

Even if you're not into emerging markets, their financials are beautiful. Their earnings call yesterday posted 89% growth in revenues year over year. They generated over 1 billion this year in sales on digital commerce platforms in China alone.

Their magazine is dead, but their brand isn't and I'm bullish on how they are transforming their company.

TLDR: I'm in shares and long options for PLBY because of their involvement in NFTs and overall company transformation."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hello all, I got into PLBY on IPO day and posted about it but some clown deleted it. Also know that they acquired like 40 brick and mortar stores, sell a shit-ton of clothing in china, have a casino, are getting into sports betting and NFTs, and smashed earnings during covid."

Im not understanding how to protect against these massive short losses."
03/25/2021,stocks,See the problem was I stopped buying shit companies and started buying broad market ETFs. So instead of single companies shitting the bed now the entire market is going down.

03/25/2021,stocks,"The way to protect yourself against 30-50% retracements is to properly vet the company first. New investors love getting on the bandwagon and buying whatever is being hyped. The companies that fell 50% were overhyped and were probably in a bubble. With more experience you will be able to tell the difference between speculating and investing. The warning signs were everywhere, but unfortunately it's novices who get burned. Read more, do your own research, finger off the trigger, only buy high conviction stocks, stay diversified if you don't have the time to manage your portfolio. Doing these things will soften any future blows."

These companies were never “worth” their lofty share prices when they were at all time highs, just like Pets.com wasn’t worth 100 per share during that mania in 1999. I’m not saying it is a bubble and these companies will zero out, but I do think some of the speculative fervor around them is going to subside."

03/25/2021,stocks,It used to be 10% average in a YEAR was great returns for the market. You can't expect an ETF to be up 1% every week - it's on target as long as it gains even 1% a *month*. What is called side-ways trading is actually just the normal state of the market; it's the 300% bull run in the last five years that's been ridiculous.

I went for a completely garbage prediction it was gonna drop to $350 and set my limit buy there and of course it didn’t happen cause I’m an idiot. Would $500 limit buy be reasonable? I’m not sure.

I’m currently holding AAPL 127.5c 1/21/22 and DIS 220c 1/21/22. I wouldn’t say I regret buying into Disney but I’m already down around 30% on that position. I’m not planning on moving out of it, but I am considering moving my strike up. It’s held up well during this shit market but it seems to be falling on Disney+ growth worries amid the NFLX rise and recent price increases on Disney+ membership. With opening uncertain for now, Disney streaming services and online entertainment seem to be it’s top line right now. The cruise line opening pushback to later in the year may be driving Disney down a little over worries about park re-openings.

I warned that there was no way Fauci and the CDC would lift restrictions on these cruise companies but you people kept droning on and on about the vaccines.  Well here we are.  The restrictions will remain in place and the hopium high you were all on has just crashed.  All the summer cruises that Carnival booked will now have to be canceled.  They have a huge burn rate and that means trouble.  The only option moving forward for Carnival is either more offerings and crippling debt or bankruptcy restructuring.

10% of Americans have tested positive for covid... This isn't including asymptomatic people who haven't tested positive and family members who decided to not get a test bc family member did

25% of Americans have received at least one dose of a vaccine

We're vaccinating on average 2.5 million people a day with production only increasing

Let's say 1/3 of covid cases are symptomatic. That is 30% of US with antibodies plus 25% have at least 1 vaccine.. Let's assume there is 10% overlap we are at 45% of US with some sort of antibodies or part immunity currently

If a little over half the vaccinations are newly vaccinated people we are talking ~0.5% of the US are gaining immunity daily. So what is that 60 days until we are at 75% immunity? End of May...

03/25/2021,stocks,"Agreed. Read the same stuff about AMC around $4, and the rebound from $2 to $7ish was before it was a meme stock. I just don't see a huge company like CCL being finished off by this."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yup, been warned about CCL, RCL, and NCLH since I bought into them in March 2020. I'm assuming by the same people who had all their money on the sidelines until about Nov/Dec."
03/25/2021,stocks,i didn't even think about the actual legal liability that these companies returning to cruises could bring on them. if a ship had an outbreak and it ended up in disaster that is a class action lawsuit waiting to happen. i totally missed that.
03/25/2021,stocks,"yeah, the market will price in 2025 cruise vacations at this point"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Even worse.  He's the type of self-satisfied oracle who uses small, carefully selected sample sizes to rush to say ""I told you so.""

03/25/2021,stocks,for what 2025?
03/25/2021,stocks,lol. exactly. and i believe the cruise companies know this and that is why they have been self canceling.  they don't know what to do.
03/25/2021,stocks,"They are literal plague ships.  The insistence on people going on the cruises they paid for literally kick started the pandemic because everyone who was on the ships was able to disembark and rejoin the general population without any form of quarantine.  Cruise ships are an interstate business, people travel from every state to board cruise ships in a select few states, why should that select few states have the authority to make public health decisions with potential negative consequences for all states?"
03/25/2021,stocks,The argument for bankruptcy is that you get to restructure your debt to more favorable terms.  If I was ceo i would be trying to use the pandemic and cdc restrictions to make my case for bankruptcy.
03/25/2021,stocks,It went up again today.
03/25/2021,stocks,i think they are legitimately concerned that a ship will have covid spread like wildfire and possibly cause a lot of deaths.  how much these vaccines actually protect people is still unclear. lets not kid ourselves. the vaccines were rushed. they may be safe but may not help especially with all the new variants of the virus.
03/25/2021,stocks,It's far from dead. I expect full capacity allowable by states once these cruise resume operation again. That had been the case for taiwan
03/25/2021,stocks,the vaccinations won't be done for a long time.

03/25/2021,stocks,no. it was in a solid downward trend prior to the pandemic.
03/25/2021,stocks,They were definitely in a clear downtrend before the pandemic.  It started in 2018 and is pretty clear on the chart.

And it's cheap as shit. You pay like $600 and get to spend a solid week wasted on a cool ass boat, worrying about nothing. Cruises are awesome, and that's coming from someone who spent 4 years backpacking and partying in Asia."
03/25/2021,stocks,"While I’d agree cruises in 2021 doesn’t sound like a safe bet.

However cruises normally are pretty dope.  All the naysayers in here probably never been judging by the context of their hate.

People claiming shitty food don’t understand there’s like 15+ restaurants on these things, lots of fine dining and quality meals.  Sure there are burgers or nachos at the pool bar but it’s the same as any other tropical resort.

It’s a moving resort.  Anyone who’s been to Jamaica never left the resort as they’re enclosed in barb wire.  Same deal with lots of these poor ass tropical countries.  They’re known for tourism so they protect and shield the tourists from real island life.

Everything you need is on the ship, it’s a small floating city/mega resort.  And it’s non stop action if you want, or chill quiet vibes on the ocean.  They have constant classes, activities, events, shows, entertainment, etc.

We did more on our cruise then on a half dozen other vacations combined.  In single day you can have a sunrise breakfast, yoga class or jog on the running deck.  Followed by a nap by the pool, then you disembark in like Haiti and go do some coffee factory and whiskey tour.  You’re half loaded and have Island meal of local seafood n the beach.  Get back on the boat and there is literally a concert and dancing on the pool deck.  You grab a slice of pizza and go back to the room, get ready for a formal ass fancy dinner.  Eat a 5 course meal in a gorgeous ballroom.  Waiters do a song and dance number.  Then you’re drunk and grab a pint at the Irish pub on deck 5.  Then it’s 10:30 and there’s a Broadway style show starting in the theater.  Maybe you skip the show for a comedy act on the Lido deck.  Grab another drink and head to the casino.  Gamble and drink and stubble to the club, dance until 3am.  Then when you’re shit faced you walk past a French bakery and grab some mystery sandwich on a croissant along with 2 chocolate cookies.  All before stumbling into your room to sleep and do it all over the next day.

It’s also very easy socially since you see the same people and make friends.

They’re not cheap either.  Sure some older ships in the fleet cater to the drunk college crowd.  But some of these couples or family ships can easily cost over $10,000 for a 7-day cruise."
03/25/2021,stocks, im guessing you dont mingle with the middle to lower middle class. It’s a yearly thing for many families that have a negative networth and they will save up all year just so they can go on a cruise. My girlfriend teaches at a title 1 elementary school and half of them go on cruises.

He does make valid points though. Cruising is most likely dead this year unless the recovery goes almost perfectly. But I think it will eventually be back. Personally I don't see a world where the industry dies and nobody ever sails on a cruise ever again. It will be one of the last things to recover fully though, so the opportunity cost of waiting might not be worth the risk."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I respect your short, but the morons that like cruises don’t give a fuck about COVID. Bought at $10 range and figured 2-3 year investment."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Which part do you disagree with? 

I understand they didn't lift the cruise ban, but why would they... It wouldn't make any sense to lift it until they are 100% comfortable with where we are at. Which isn't now. It could be by mid to end of summer is all I'm saying"

03/25/2021,stocks,"Yup. I used to shit on cruises all the time too. 

Until I went on one. 

Then I went on 5 more. 

They’re cheaper than hotels, and you wake up in cool places occasionally. The booze isn’t any more overpriced than a landside bar, and if you’re cruising to Mexico those bars are even cheaper. 

You spend drunken nights in hot tubs with hot people. 

Once in a great while (not on any of the cruises I’ve been on) there’s an outbreak of something. Also, you avoid RCL because it’s all old people and they suck. But CCL is fucking fun."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Also worth keeping in mind old people will all be vaccinated soon, and a lot of them don't take covid seriously"
03/25/2021,stocks,People were getting the stomach viruses left and right before the pandemic. I think cruises you're just asking for trouble. It's too many people in an enclosed system.

03/25/2021,stocks,The market has been speculating that the vaccine rollout would lead to the restrictions being lifted early.  That is why is started running to 52 week highs.  But in recent days news of europe going back into lockdown has been dragging this ticker down.  Now that the cdc won't be lifting the restrictions the selloff is here.  They will need to cancel all those newly booked summer cruises that they were hoping would be a go.  This company has a massive cash burn rate. They can't survive like this.  This will head back to teens before it ever recovers.
03/25/2021,stocks,"The reason he keeps posting this is because he's probably getting absolutely butt fucked and blown out. He's desperate for people to sell and drive the price down.

03/25/2021,stocks,did you miss the whole pandemic? the selloff?  did you sleep through all that?
03/25/2021,stocks,"So I’ve been on many cruises, and I have the exact opposite opinion.  The cruises aren’t ever over booked, they usually get to about 75-85% capacity. As far as cattle, people stand around and graze all day lol. There are lines to get on and off the ship, and finding a pool chair outside can be tough, but the only other time you’re forced somewhere is to that initial safety meeting. I’ve never had an issue with being thrown off the ship. That would only happen in extreme circumstances, were you doing something you shouldn’t have?
The last cruise I went on was $1200 including airfare across the country. That paid for a weeks worth of a hotel room, all you can eat meals, fine dining at night (swordfish, prime rib, crab legs), plenty of drinks, excursions at every port, and lots of other activities onboard.  Dollar to dollar, cruising is a cheap vacation. A nice hotel room in a random city is going to be $150 a night, so $1050 for the week. If you want you can think I paid $150 for all the food, drinks excursions etc. I have a hard time seeing that as a terrible scam."
03/25/2021,stocks,they will have to. they have a huge cash burn rate.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Just get vaccinated.  Of course if you're comprised it's a different story,  but people my age survive at like 99%."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Exactly. Early april all of this type crap will most likely be springing back up.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Why does everyone forget that the bank has lending standards, which tighten when rates are low? Its like people assume banks just hand out loans like candy.

Why anyone gives them any credibility is beyond me."
03/25/2021,stocks,What inflation?
03/25/2021,stocks,"There is definitely a bigger bull case than I thought. I assumed cruises were becoming increasingly unpopular due to their hefty price tag, but how wrong I was when I looked over their past earnings. That debt will definitely cut into their next 2 or so years of profits, but I take back my original statement on possible bankruptcy. I now have absolutely no clue how it'll move over the next few years, which probably shouldn't come as a surprise"

Second if you want to see many different islands, like some of these 9-10 day cruises provide,  you don’t have to pack every night or pay airfare to go there everyday."

03/25/2021,stocks,Long term play bro. Hype from some and FUD from cdc. Got my vaccine already and my observations of FB/work tell me we are fine. A majority of my work has been vaccinated and many drives and regular appointments have provided the vaccine.
03/25/2021,stocks,"They said the guidance would ""remain unchanged."" Have you've read the guidance or just the news headline? There are 3 current ways for cruises to resume and it just needs to meet one of those. Linked below. 

https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/cruise/index.html

But yes you are right it's a mystery when they'll sail again. And they're burn rate is MASSIVE!

Good news is you can act on your opinion and short CCL. It could very well pay out. 

I'm ultimately optimistic for a longer term play and will gladly buy more stock if it gets near my price average of $12."

03/25/2021,stocks,"> you're not factoring in the plateau. some people won't get it.

and you're not factoring in that they don't matter. every disease/virus has people that refuse to get the vaccine. 

we don't need 100% of the country vaccinated. the bar for ""herd immunity"" is only like 70% or something in that ball park.

if some people don't want to get a vaccine for a virus they have a 99.995% chance of recovering from, it's not the end of the world. the majority will have it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The sell off? Only down 8% for the month.. Its been running for a year and great for trading swings since 2020. CCL has a shit future obviously, but if you got in early, you made out good. I'm surprised it didnt dip more today tbh."
03/25/2021,stocks,"During that initial safety meeting is the 1st time they rummage through your things btw. The fine dining is extra same with drinks. The food that is included is the same food reheated for every meal every day by the 3rd its rock hard, and if you want to drink anything that isn't water that tasted like it came from a can its 75 a day 25 for wifi. Your math is off, a hotel at 150 a night for a week would be about 750 a 5 day cruise is 2 g not counting anything else like excursions or events. At hotel you can leave anytime and seek out stuff you aren't trapped like a prison while a family of 20 calls dibs on the hottub and they lock the doors to the entertainment venus after they reach capacity. Also I've heard of people forcibly disembarked for as lil as flicking a cigarette overboard all I did was ask for a new mattress lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Some also get very very sick and some get very long lasting symptoms. 99 percent survive from one event (which can be avoided) is not the brag that you think it is. It’s just one event in a long life. It’s still many people at your school dead etc. 
The Brazilian strain is especially hard on younger people and much more infectious than the original. Brazilian officials say that with the original often just one family member would get sick, that basically never happens with the new one. The whole family gets sick now and the benefit of being young is not as strong."

03/25/2021,stocks,"I doubt bankruptcy. They have a crapload of assets. They not only own boats but private islands, tours.  Cruise sucks for young people but when you have old people and a family cruises are fantastic.  Keeps the young ones in one place and old people don't need to keep up.  My only worry is in the short term Europe is locking back down.  Also cruises are known to be germ factories even before the pandemic.  Every cruise I've been in they sell out their guided tours and the money they make on board is insane.   If they can sail again that is."

All the food I mentioned was the free fine dining you get every night. The food is the same on my last cruise as my first. I’m sure they cook in bulk where they can (think a bunch of steaks cooked in a suis vide), but it is certainly not rock hard.  Check out some prices on Royal Caribbean, they have constant deals. When I went it was ~$550 for the cruise , $350 for airfare, and I spent $300 on some excursions and drinks. Keep in mind at any hotel you have housekeeping going through your room, so that’s fine by me. It sounds like you don’t like being stuck in one place and a cruise definitely could feel trapped when you are out at sea for a day or two at a time."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, but that doesnt effect inflation."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Food prices are way up in developing countries.  They're only up a few percent in wealthy countries.  Housing isn't a bubble either.  You have massive conglomerates and landlords that have bought an outrageous number of properties.  The 3 wealthiest land owners own as much land as south Carolina.  In Berlin, 2 *American* companies own 10% of all dwelling units and they are ranked numbers 2 and 3 in terms of total dwelling unit ownership.  I have to assume the same reality is playing out in the US, if not worse.  Houses are high because the supply is low.

People keep saying tech is over valued and some probably is, but certainly not all.  And as far as stocks go, there's plenty of undervalued sectors.

There are some supply shortages playing out because of the pandemic, like semiconductors, but its not because of a fundamental lack of resources.

The inflation we are (probably) going to see will be transitory."

03/25/2021,stocks,I've only been on NCL and RCL so I was wondering how it compared.  RCL was definitely old people / families.  I went on NCL with my gf now wife and we had a blast but there was definitely only a handful of other couples / youngish people there.  CCL has a younger crowd?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Same here. I go on 2-3 a year because CCL sends me offers that I don't pass up, anything below 500 (total for two people) for a seven day cruise I will jump on since it's not a long drive to Galveston for us. If we can find cheap air travel we will leave from New Orleans or Miami and spend a day or two there before the cruise.  I do gotta say the first two times I went I didn't much enjoy myself but ever since I stopped going to the dinner on port days and just allow myself to sleep off the alcohol from the beach, I have had a much better time. 

The other day I was gonna do some yard work and put on some spray on sunscreen. I tell you the smell of the sunscreen took me back to Lido deck! I am itching to get back to a cruise, we are tentatively planning for Feb '22, maybe Nov 21 if we feel comfortable with the vaccination rate by then."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I've owned RCL since $32. I'm not worried. I'm a financial advisor, I don't aay that as a recommendation, but because I talk to old people all day about their plans to spend money. Most of them are itching to go. Soon as they're vaccinated or allowed. Just look at miami right now... Lots and lots of people don't care. I was looking at resorts in the caribbean for the early summer.... Booked. And booked with them charging a premium."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It won’t ever be “eradicated” just like the flu strains can’t be. But when you have 80% success rate in a vaccine it means the disease drops its R value tremendously.

And if food prices are up a few percent that also means inflation is up a few percent. Inflation is usually only a few percent you know...yet it has a big effect.



Semiconductors might also get in bubble territory due to low demand but that'll be fixed soon enough. Supply will ramp up, but as for housing (and land) it's not so easy to just ""open another factory"". Houses takes time..."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Modern flu isn't nearly as severe, damaging to survivors, or deadly. And, again, we have zero long-term data on the vaccines. This is closer to norovirus or cholera.

Cruise ships should be banned for a year, make mask and sanitizer usage mandatory for a decade, and require proof of 99%-effective vaccine for all crew and passengers. And if just one person tests positive at sea, the boat becomes a plague ship until no people test positive for two weeks.

03/25/2021,stocks,I think a market crash is inevitable at this point. Inflation also seems like a huge risk. Thats why I have been playing it safe lately. Been using like 10% of my portfolio to short and using the rest in limited downside plays.

My entire PC setup is corsair components and so is all of my friends’, my past couple phones have all been iPhones, all of my cpu’s have been AMD cpu’s, I use paypal and believe in financial tech, and I think biotech is a good industry for the future, but my timing wasn’t ideal, so I don’t know whether to sell and try and make my money back through trading other stocks or to just hold and average down over time. I currently have no cash to put back in to the market so I can’t average down right now.

No stock is likely to go to zero, so unless you need the money soon, selling at a loss is almost never a good idea (tax benefits that result from losses aside. those can be useful, but only if you think a stock will stay fairly steady so you can buy back in after receiving your tax deduction without having lost anything)"

When people asked at that time ""should I buy?"" - everyone's advice was - ""yes, do not try to time the market."" And that makes sense because those stocks could have kept going up. However, I do think that both time in the market and (a little bit of) timing the market is a good strategy. For example, I am buying some of the stocks I bought high to lower my average. \[edit: typo\]"

03/25/2021,stocks,Right. He needs to look at fundamentals and decide what he feels is fair value when considering projected growth. If he does this he’ll be fine in the long run. Even if he doesn’t and just hold he’ll probably be fine in the long run as well. Just not as good.

03/25/2021,stocks,This sounds like some ridiculous shit you’d hear on r/GME. Not everything revolves around GameStop and these shitty meme stocks that had a run for a couple days months ago. Only 1-2 hedge funds lost big on GameStop and they’ve probably already made it back.

We got Prs dropping left and right along with catalysts but price still tanks due to blatant mm manipulation keeping price down and literally as you said

> shorting the whole market

Its crazy. 

Now if you are from the OTC world some people are saying that this blatant mm manipulation is due to OTCs running hot last December and early this year and mms   had to come in and pull the rug while others are saying as you said this is due to big lossses from GME and Mms shorting everything to make their numbers profitable for the record books for this month and expect to rebound April

Now if it goes past April then we may be due for something massive"
03/25/2021,stocks,"ya but you cant compare anything to last year. The pandemic caused EVERYTHING to drop and it created a ""once in most peoples lifetime"" opportunity to buy really low and make a lot of money in a short amount of time."

Their growth is still there though so I’m not too worried about them."

03/25/2021,stocks,"So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The last time I looked at a companies value, the bottom was zero.

I loved the macbooks, imacs and ipod. I ended up buying Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Sirius, XM, Jetblue. I bought companies I believed in and just never touched them because I didn’t know too much and thought they might be a good nest egg one day."

2021-03-25 01:34:41,stocks,"Need Stimulus Check Help to Buy Dips Hello everybody,

I know this probably isn't the right place to be asking but nowhere else has gotten me even a single reply so I'm willing to try.

I'm a dependent (26 year old currently in grad school) and so we were expecting my and my mother's stimulus checks to be deposited in her account today, as scheduled by the tracker.  Today, my mother checks her account and she gets a deposit from the IRS for...270 dollars.

Does anybody know what could have happened here?  Based off our calculations, we were expecting about 3200 total, 1400 for me and 1800 for her so we really don't understand what happened.

Half of this money was supposed to pay of bills and another half was going to be invested and/or buying the dips so this is really extremely disappointing.

Thank you."

2021-03-25 01:03:39,stocks,"Genuinely wondering if everyone here is an investor? It seems to me that every sub such as this one is filled with people that have the same concept - buy and hold until it eventually goes up because trend only goes up. If anyone dares to mention they got out of a trade within a week they get downvoted. As if trading is an unknown concept to people. Should I mention day trading? Probably not. The name of the sub suggests that people on here talk about stocks. You're free to be a day trader or an investor, there is no right or wrong way to make profit off of stocks. 

This post was inspired by somebody's comment being downvoted by a few people where OP said something like ""I sold my AAPL shares"". The responses were personal attacks and how you NeVeR SeLL. 

You guys, not everyone wants to invest. Some of us want to get in and out quickly. It's like relationships. You want to marry your stock? Go for it. But I want a one night stand and not be shamed for it."

03/25/2021,stocks,"I remember when I tried to time the market and trade in and out. Sometimes I got lucky but over the course of a year I tend to be only marginally up if not down even on a year where index is up like 10%. 

Now I’m 90/10 funds/stock. I make trades twice a year and each position holds for at least 1 year (unless it’s down 40%-50% then it’s an automatic sell). By simply rely on sector and region exposure to my benchmark (MSCI ACWI). My returns is more stable and higher than I ever was when trading. 

Sure trading is exhilarating and something to brag to friends and coworkers about. I like the state of portfolio now that I’m married to positions. It’s stable and I don’t have to worry about testing it for herpies every few months."

If you manage to turn up a profit in twenty years that is fine too. Eventually every investor will sell their stocks, otherwise they are useless."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You’re right. I almost feel like there should be a subreddit dedicated to the 401k/IRA crowd where long term holds are discussed. Maybe there is, but it’s definitely not as popular on Reddit.

Everyone is an investor, but in my mind there is a difference. Long term Investing is for your Roth IRA and/or 401k account for retirement decades from now. Short term investing is for your brokerage account. Whether short term is an hour, a month, or a year it’s up to you. We all have different goals here and I think there should be room for comment and discussion no matter what. 

Im not a big trader, and definitely not a day trader because it would drive me nuts, but those who are into it shouldn’t be shamed and dismissed. Not everyone who trades a few times a week is a Wall Street bets GME idiot."
03/25/2021,stocks,"""Investment"" is literally ""putting on clothes.""

Figuratively it's the act of changing the form your wealth is in.

So it can be anything, regardless of form or timespan.

And changing back to cash is investment also.

That said, more specific phrases like ""investing in a company"" have more specific meanings; that one in particular means giving money to the company that it can spend. Buying stock on the secondary market is not that.  VCs and underwriter syndicates invest in companies. Reddit muppets invest in stock."

Now I just buy and hold, and if I have extra cash I put them in my favorite picks but only on the REALLY red days. I’m young, so even if half of them go to 0 I’ll have put enough money in others to make up for it. At this point I actually like seeing red since I finally get to buy stuff lmao"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I invest in terrible stocks only. I also hold them long term. Why you ask I suck at researching stocks I am good at trends though. 

Such as $S|\|DL I have lost nearly 5K on the stock but I made $11,000 net on selling options. I sell PUTS before earnings calls and Calls for after earnings. 

Most crap stocks get pumped before and fall quickly after. So I keep my premium. I have also failed miserably at this as well. I lost 20,000 shares of GME because I was selling deep OTM calls and then January happened. Every one of my calls got exercised had that not happened I would be better off than I am now. 

No I’m not salty about missing information and not following the news or social media around stocks. If I did I might be salty. I have lost a lot of stocks like this but I have always made come out net positive thanks to collecting premiums. 

Idk if I qualify as a investor being an options seller but I enjoy doing it."

I have 3 different small brokerage accounts that I use for fun....  2 separate TD Ameritrades (because that's where I started, I like the format and the foreign transaction fees are lower) and a Schwab (which is joint but basically I manage, this is my penny acct because they don't charge commission on OTC)  While I have invested portions of the brokerage $$ into long-term holds, I also have a rotation basis for when to buy or sell (no options for me, thanks) and once I see something short-term has made a decent profit, I sell it.  I try to base my trades on percentages since I'm not working with a whole lot of capital in the brokerages, like for example I made +20% on 1 and -7% on another, I'll sell both if there's not major catalysts upcoming.  But it's something to keep me occupied, learn and make some money while I'm on a long-term leave of absence from work because of covid & able to pull unemployment for the 1st time in my life.

I'm a buy and hold investor with roughly 60% in boring index funds. The rest are long term stock positions including ~5% ARK funds (gasp). 

Why am I saying this? Because I don't really fit into any particular sub, and that's the way I like it. Earlier today I was permanently banned from bogleheads because I defended a 5% position in ARK funds and how it can work (for me) with my investing philosophy. 

I hope this sub stays neutral and people are open minded to different strategies and goals because there's enough places on reddit to be portfolio shamed if that's what we're after."

03/25/2021,stocks,"If you take value investing literally and you have a lot of determination, you will be a day trader. It is possible to day trade and still be ""sophisticated"". The reason most people avoid this is that they'd rather not bet against everyone else in the market. It's typically safer just to ride along and make some money with everyone else.

As you said, this sub is about stock trading, and day trading is a kind of trading. But given that speculation is zero-sum and a lot of short-term profit goes to market makers, you should expect to find many people here who (rightfully) advise against it."

03/25/2021,stocks,"I think there are three camps.

Traders, who jump in and out and view tickers as numbers.

Investors, who see their portfolio as partial ownership in a group of businesses. That doesn't mean you never sell, but you think long and hard about selling and consider the tax implications of doing so. They understand correlations between their assets, they understand the sensitivity of their valuations to fluctuations in interest rates and other key factors and they build a portfolio with a precise objective.

Quacks, who read a bunch of WB quotes but never in their life calculated a NPV and don't know what the equity risk premium even is. They may be looking at the P/E or P/B ratio as if it were the most relevant piece of data, but they will willingly compare today's valuations to some other period in time when Treasuries yielded 5%."
03/25/2021,stocks,"On my Roth IRA which I consider long term I treat it like a garden. I don’t have anything more then 5-10 percent of my portfolio unless it had hyper growth like tesla.  I trim it wear it needs it an add seeds that I feel that will grow while nourishing my main crops.

When tesla hit more than 10 percent of my portfolio last year I trimmed it down to about 7 percent. I sold between 700-780. I then redistributed that into how I keep my portfolio which is give or take, 50 percent index/etfs 20-30 percent large and mega cap tech like faang, 10-20 percent cash or hyper growth speculative stocks like PLTR Spacs weed and cash for dips.

Unfortunately I don’t have cash right now for dips since I’m bagholding right now but that’s what I usually do during a downtrend anyway since I’m with the time in the market vs timing the market group at times like these.

With my individual broker account I’m more aggressive and WSB style type of investor but it helps when you take 1k to 6 figures in a year. It does hurt to see it fall about 40 percent in the last two months( bought spacs on top of the SPaC bubble which is probably the hardest hit sector) but fortunate enough that GME gains help me keep my sanity.

Honestly everyone will hate this part but I should have kept using Robinhood for my IB account. I had a lot of trouble getting my money out since February and held stocks that fucked me big and didn’t want to sell due to not wanting to ruin the transfer. Not sure if I would have played it differently in Robinhood, but the transfer headache, down market and learning a new platform sort of all happened at once."
03/25/2021,stocks,I wouldnt call myself an investor. I never sell. But that's because I'm treating my portfolio like a scoreboard for retirement.

He was convinced a ""true"" investor never ever ever has cash on hand, meaning they never sell and only buy."

03/25/2021,stocks,"There’s room in the market for both, I think.

Part of the problem right now - and this is my problem, so maybe I am projecting - is that lots of people are thinking on both sides at once. 

It may be a great investment play, but is it a good trade? It may be a great trade, but can you separate yourself from its status as a poor investment long enough to let yourself trade it without some revulsion?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m not. This is just from my experience on trading and investing. I get it too...back then it was exciting and full of emotions watch the market swings. However this is where I need to bash on the avg trader here. Almost everyone here has to believe they have an edge and they have a great idea or strategy. However truth is most don’t. Most follows the crowd. most of the information (that’s freely available) is the same information that’s echoed. So this results in the trades are always crowded trades. I too was like that too. I had my valuation templates, scanning articles for ideas. Doing my own research thinking I can find that informational alpha. Those that can truly make it....It’s a special accomplishment and I am truly happy for them. 

The funny thing is I stopped looking at the market everyday when I actually started working in the industry. After truly see how we managed a client portfolio from alpha research to risk models to trade execution to performance analysis. Then the size of our budget dedicated to buying data and information....this isn’t a fair game for a retail investor."
03/25/2021,stocks,"To clarify, I don't think one has to be either a speculator **or** an investor. People can obviously be both.

Anyway, I would consider speculating to be one of these things:

- Buying/selling stock in a company without looking into any sort of valuations, cash flows, etc.

- Engaging in options trading

- Day trading, or buying & selling a stock over the short-term (obviously there's no strict definition here but I'd say anything less than a year is arguably speculative)"

They're always trying to avoid big losses, that's what keeps them above average. It's true they will never get huge 10 baggers like long term investors do, but they can compound 5% gains month after month and it adds up. This is also controversial, but very good traders believe you can time the market, because patterns arise and things repeat themselves. Setups and exits. But if you don't want to worry about any of that, then go ahead and buy an index."

2021-03-25 01:02:37,stocks,"BLUE DD - Risky but great short term upside potential **BLUE** 

**Key Info:**

\- Bitotech, engages in researching, developing, and commercializing transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer. 

\- Over three years, bluebird bio grew revenue at 75% per year.

\- This stock recently took an absolute tanking mid feb from \~46$ to $25. This was due to a patient who received an acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis, and concerns were that it could be related to a BLUE product.

\- More recently BLUE announced its experimental gene therapy for blood diseases ""likely wasn't the culprit in a patient's cancer diagnosis."". The stock bumped up a bit short term but didn't stay there, likely because investors are cautious and awaiting more confirmation.

&#x200B;

**Catalysts:**

\- This Saturday 27th March there is a PUDFA review

\- Mizuho Securities raised their rating from $35 to $69 and said BUY.

&#x200B;

**Risks:**

\- Class action lawsuit on behalf of shareholders who lost out recently. These are common when a stock goes down and often goes nowhere.

\- Still one outstanding query around a patient who received myelodysplastic syndrome, another type of blood cancer. Nothing said about this yet but could easily have the same outcome of simply not being related.

\- PDUFA decision could go either way.

&#x200B;

**Thoughts:**

It's a gamble stock. But the upside potential is double in a short space of time, should the trials recontinue. It's hard to see how the stock can go down more, but we all know that's famous last words and a failed PDUFA or queries on the outstanding cancer diagnosis could harm it.

I'm taking a gamble on this one."
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m hoping more for a BMY acquisition of Newco after BLUE splits the company later this year.

We should have the mentality, imo, we rather go red the entire year so we can keep buying cheaper before the next bull run starts.

2021-03-25 00:17:21,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 24, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 24, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) falling while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly rose as market participants continue to monitor the Treasury yield and the coronavirus situation in Europe. After hitting a 14-month high of 1.75%, the Treasury yield retreated to 1.616% at the time of writing. Many of the cyclical stocks that had led markets higher for much of the last three months underperformed, and the industrials, energy, and financials sectors lagged.

Market participants have also digested recent remarks from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.” While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market continues to react sharply to these statements, even though they have largely been the same for months. 

After a slow start last year, the US’ vaccination efforts are starting to paint an increasingly encouraging picture, with roughly 70% of Americans 65 years and older receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, and coronavirus related deaths have dropped below 1,000 a day on average for the first time since early November, according to data compiled by the Associated Press. Also, dozens of states have thrown open vaccinations to all adults or are planning to do so in a matter of weeks. And the White House said 27 million doses of both the one-shot and two-shot vaccines will be distributed next week, more than three times the number when President Joe Biden took office two months ago, again according to the Associated Press. 

The rosy outlook in the US remains in stark crisis to the unfolding crisis in Europe, with many officials warning or talking about a “third-wave of the virus”. Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measures for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and a reduction in the availability of intensive-care units (ICUs). UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.

2021-03-25 00:12:04,stocks,"How do so many people get roped into buying shares up to 5% over the closing price in afterhours? Like it's within seconds, so I know they were watching, right??? How the fuck do you look at 13.20-13.15 range for the last hour of the market and as soon as the market closes go ""Oh, 13.50, very nice!"" I understand a part of this is liquidity, but it almost always reaches these ridiculous extremes without reason. I figured it was just poorly executed market orders, but you can often see in level two that a lot of these trades are all done with limit orders..."

It gets tempting to go in with more, but I know the whole reason I'm even doing it is because of volatility."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yep we all learn those lessons at least once. But if a horse is running why not throw a small amount at it. Putting in $50 on $800 GME calls turned out to be a retarded win but at under $0.02 a contract I’ll take the gamble lol.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Completely agree on this. The key is to use only a little money though. My first investment was on GME after it seemed to gain ground again near the $100 mark (beginning of February). I gained 300 in the first hour, and I could have easily took the money and ran, but I held on. Ended up losing almost 200 before I decided it went on long enough... so my first experience with the market was depositing 1500 dollars and having it reduced to 1300. That hurt in an almost physical way. I think I even thought about the stop order option in the order types. Maybe I'm misrembering, but it seems exactly like me to realize the best possible idea and not actually implement it lmao.

If you mix greed and volatility often enough I think you'll always find yourself naked in the middle of a perfect storm."

03/25/2021,stocks,Sometimes people have thin skin and they just don’t understand the truth of today’s reality
03/25/2021,stocks,"Because those cruise ships are sitting idle.  It costs hundreds of millions to maintain a fleet of ships.  When the companies can sail, they need to spend hundreds of millions to resume operation.  You can't just resume cruise immediately.  Lots of logistics.  

Lets not forget about their debt (billions of dollars). Over leveraging their debt+high interest. 

Reduced fleet size.  Limited ship capacity reduces passengers=fewer rooms booked=fewer drink packages=fewer excursions=fewer gamblers in their casinos, etc...

last but not least they have been diluting their shares to raise $$$."

What do you guys think is the reason for the SPX being up while all the major companies in the SPX itself like AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, FB etc can’t seem to follow it even though they’re usually the main dictators?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, because hedge funds are so floated on AMC and GME shorts, it’s tanking the entire market.

03/25/2021,stocks,I thought it was because the semiconductor companies would be paying more for raw materials when making the semiconductors resulting in more expenses
03/25/2021,stocks,"They are priced “comparatively low,” but that’s why they just haven’t dropped nearly as much as those no-profit companies. So their pull back has been moderate. Their PE is still higher than market average, so they will see a pull back while defensive stocks (eg LMT, DE) will see a little rise. This isn’t abnormal and idk why people are losing their shit."

I mean, in the market there should be X ways to affect the market to go UP, and X ways to affect the market to go DOWN. But in reality, there are 2 ways to affect the market to go down (short selling, selling a share), and just 1 to affect the market to go up. How can be this fair at all? 
What am i missing? 
Consider what i am saying like stupid sentences from a guy that does not understand the system at all.

That's because bad news meant Powell would interfere with the markets.  Now good news means the opposite.  Powell will let bond yields to continue to rise without intervention because he views them as a sign of a recovering economy.  He will let inflation run rampant to hit it long term targets.  His ending of the SLR exemptions is a very clear signal he is done propping up the market now that it doesn't need it.

It’s almost like no one has seen a bear market.

I feel like I have a pretty well diversified portfolio.  I'm not really heavy on any one particular stock out of the ones below, so I'm not even sure where the majority of the losses are coming from.  I'm still green on most everything but I've given back a lot of gains, these definitely aren't all my investments but a majority of the bigger positions.    
Tech/Growth:  AAPL, GOOG, PLTR, TSLA, AMZN, AMD, UBER, BABA, JD etc. \~35%  
Travel/Rebound (cyclical):  UAL, AAL, OXY, MGM, MAR, NCLH, TRIP, ABNB \~30%  
Financials: WFC, BCS, JPM, BAC\~10%  
Retail stocks for stimulus check play:  UAA, NKE, M, LULU, etc.  \~10%  
Other positions making up less than 15%   


Somehow I've lost about 20% of my portfolio with these names in the last month, it doesn't feel like it but every day it goes down 1 or 2% and that starts to add up.  I know I know, in 5 years who cares but I just wanted to know if other people seem to be in the same boat.  I haven't seen the main indexes see that kind of loss so I'm not getting where it seems to be coming from.  Even today when all looked great in the morning now somehow I'm deep red again (another 2%) despite indexes being mostly stable."
03/25/2021,stocks,"This is why people buy index funds.  They feel that if the fund goes down, it's well diversified so they feel more comfortable just leaving it alone.  When you get into stock picking and things go down, you start to doubt yourself.  So, in a time like this, I think it would be a good idea to ask yourself why its going down and then determine whether or not you should sell because the fundamentals have changed OR stay in it, because the fundamentals have NOT changed and this is just short term noise.

IMHO I think your positions look fine.  The reopening is not going to be a straight line.  There is going to be some drama.  The more unrealized gains people are sitting on (which is going to be a TON after last year), the more they are going to be inclined to sell to lock in their profit when things start to look a little less certain.

For me, it comes down to 1 thing - QE Infinity is a POWERFUL drug and it's going to make stocks go sky high in the long run.  So, I'm sticking it out."

03/25/2021,stocks,Maybe it’s because the market somehow doubled in value during a global pandemic and now it needs to correct itself a bit
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm in the same boat and have been trying to figure out what's going on. My conclusion is that a lot of people here (including myself) think they're well-diversified but in reality they're missing out on huge chunks of the market that are actually doing well.

Industrials and Materials are two sectors that have outperformed the market this month, and IMO they're the best way to play the recovery now that cyclicals are entering a correction. But you won't see them very much on Reddit because they're considered ""boomer"" stocks. Well, the boomers probably know a thing or two that we don't.

Just from the tickets you’ve put most have a heavy presence in America which has obviously been hard hit from covid. This could be a lesson to understand how diversified you truly are and solidify why you invested in the first place. That being said this decrease should be forgotten in the long run if you did proper analysis.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah you have a diversified portfolio but nearly every stock you've listed is more volatile than the market, averaging a Beta of 1.6.

But everything is going down. Even the penny stocks are dropping rapidly, which is alarming. A stock that you buy in at $1, goes up to almost $1.40 and then suddenly drops $0.25 over the weekend? That is significant. I feel like I’ve basically thrown my money away, and all the research and DD I did before purchasing the stock was a complete waste of time because it doesn’t even matter. It doesn’t seem to make a difference that the company is doing very well and that they’ve got a lot of positive things coming and planned for the future. Down goes the stock.

03/25/2021,stocks,"So, am I understanding this correctly?  The hedges Have the ability to drive down these prices causing us to freak out and sell and then they profit by taking our money? So if we never sell, then we win the game right?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks for posting. Not just you. I have lots of VTI, which is supposed to be the total stock market. Down significantly."
03/25/2021,stocks,"No, not just you. I decided to enter this arena aggressively and now I feel like someone popped my balloon."
03/25/2021,stocks,You and me both! Thank god Wells Fargo  is holding their own though. AAPL HYLN and TSLA crushing me
03/25/2021,stocks,\*scribbling notes\* *follow this guy to find the dips*
03/25/2021,stocks,Saying fuck the savings balance and putting more in to average down. Might as well buy the dip and ride it out.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Between the bonds, inflation fears, j pow, and SPY going up one day and the other the next going down and back around the circle I'm down 47.98% this month. 

Also, the stupid games the heggies are playing are pissing me off too. The level 2 order book for AMD the other day was cheating. Buying and selling shares over and over around the same price to keep the stock from moving up and bringing it down. I saw them doing it on other stocks too."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yup, same. I think this is one of those times where you swear off checking for a month or two as a sanity break and then by then things should stabilize"
03/25/2021,stocks,Yup. Everything sucks for like the last 6 weeks straight.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yup

It feels like algorithms are kickin* in.   Look at closing prices on the .00 or .25 .50 you get my drift?

I may SELLOUT half tomorrow and OBSERVE for 35 days or so....."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not alone dude.  I'm down about $16k after investing in a bunch of WSB meme stocks.  But just like GME, I'll hold for years until I make the profit.  Hang in there - especially if you own all of the stocks you listed - that's a hell of a portfolio."
03/25/2021,stocks,"save some cash, let the markets stabilize, then buy some more... don’t get discouraged.."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m up 15% on the year, thanks to GME, but literally every single one of the stocks I’ve bought since I opened my brokerage account in December are red, I feel fortunate that I’ve had some pretty good plays with options but would feel better to see at least one green since purchasing, makes me feel like a dumb"
03/25/2021,stocks,20%? My portfolio is down 40%...
03/25/2021,stocks,No one wants to admit it but I definitely think the whole gme fiasco has had a massive impact.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I don’t wanna be that guy, but I like to think it’s hedge funds liquidating to cover their shorts on GME and AMC and such when the time comes"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Your not alone. Every single trade I’ve made in the past 2-3 weeks has been a complete disaster. I got out of my tech heavy portfolio and bought large, mid, small, and themed ETFs along w a few positions and nothing is working. I thought to myself today. Whatever I’m going to do I’ll do the opposite. Lol, so frustrating I really just want it in cash but I think as soon as I do that it will bottom out and I’ll miss the best day of 2021. In a bad place need safe investments or at least break even. Haah you know it’s bad when your hopes are to break even on a day."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The writing was on the wall. I don’t get how ppl don’t see what’s going on in the world. Politics, currency, economic growth, money power, bond bears. Economic calendar. Thursday jobless claims in am after covers premarket too btw. Don’t forget PUT addiction. I try to warn people but they think I’m crazy when I tell them what it will drop to. Everything was bought up for this weeks bad news too. Double bottom if JPow says something dumb. Worse 10 days if yields was just a dip. I feel bad checking on discounts after banking ALL these  +100%ers.. being conservative not to b a dk. I want to say nooo don’t buy! Watch out! on good dip but don’t want to make it worse ya know. A lot going on. Patience or low floats."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Was up 30% on feb 15, all gone now. Most buys were in June July of 2020 

I’ve been buying More value and cyclicals to shore up the fort and averaging down these bullied growth stocks.  but yeah this has been brutal to see that once sturdy looking 30%+ come down so much so fast. Hold the door"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I feel as though there are only a small handful or people, ultra rich, who completely understands exactly what drives the stock market and they don’t talk.  It almost feels like we are playing a game with only half of the rule book. 🤷"
03/25/2021,stocks,Yep. Down around 25% or more. And the “it’s ok it’s a long game” thing may make people feel better but it still means it’s gonna take years to RECOVER that 25% and that’s assuming it doesn’t go down more. Its horseshit. Especially when all the companies you invested in are doing technically well and showing profit and have good earnings. It’s like the market is bullshit imaginary casino shit for millionaire baby boomers.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I just want the GameStop mess to be over, not just for the tendies, but because the rest of the market won’t have to feel the GME shockwaves anymore.

Everything I own is red."
03/25/2021,stocks,Growth stocks were on incredible run for the past year or so this is been a long time coming especially with markets reopening I think it’s just multiple factors coming too ahead at the same time. I’m holding my positions specifically because I’m still up a large amount but yes this is pain and I would expect more pain.
03/25/2021,stocks,"The people being affected by red days are mostly those who fomo'd. You shouldn't be seeing losses yet if you had invested consistently and/or earlier.

True? What do y'all think?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Another theory: we’re hitting the 1yr mark so potentially institutional and retail investors are realizing gains now that it’s long term gains (vs short term)
03/25/2021,stocks,"So I guess now was a bad time to start learning core investment strategies? Glad I didn't put too much in, I've lost about 13%."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Bleeding across the board on mine too. Like a frog in a blender, more red than green. 🐸"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think OP and the rest of you need to understand that the market is not always going to be green. Just hold long term and you’ll be fine.

Edit: what I meant by this is buy index funds and relax"
03/25/2021,stocks,Smart money insiders have been exiting in a somewhat orderly fashion - before the ushers will bar the exits and set fire to the casino with the rest of us locked inside. Definitely panic sell everything tomorrow at market open. Not financial advice.
03/25/2021,stocks,I dropped 10k in ARKK at $155ish. I’ve been avoiding looking. I have some MSFT and TSM as well.
03/25/2021,stocks,cheer up mate! We are all in the same boat!It's depressing but if you ha e the stomach for it buy more of your favorites!
03/25/2021,stocks,"youre diversified, but a lot of the names you have are near peak market penetration already."
03/25/2021,stocks,It looks like we may finally be entering an actual bear market.
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s not just you. It’s going on everywhere.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I feel this is all on purpose. They found a way to have a slow crash... they’ll slowly let the stock market deflate... to win this one, wait with any extra investment cash you have.  Buy the big dip.... i guess it will hit bottom in a month or two.. who knows how long the deflation will take"
03/25/2021,stocks,Stop staring at your portfolio. If you’re holding stock you can afford to wait.
03/25/2021,stocks,"The market is taking a huge hit at this time. My whole portfolio is bleeding red,🙀😐🤯"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Just buy more on the way down if you believe in your stocks. Any time the market is red it means stocks are on sale.

I’m an idiot who is also down this month. This is not financial advice."
03/25/2021,stocks,"My portfolio is down 16% the past week, it’s a rough one"
03/25/2021,stocks,Just had a crazy bull market man
03/25/2021,stocks,I've got friends who think making money is easy. That if their not making 100% then it's a bust. The past years has just bred people of that mentality.
03/25/2021,stocks,stocks are a stressful game. about a year ago i considered just having my whole portfolio just be IBM and boy that would've been a great idea in hindsight but i didnt...they seem untouched as most of tech falls.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Might sound a bit harsh but you sound like my neurotic buddy who constantly bitches about how his portfolio is down so and so percent (or the other way) every few days. 

Patience, dude. I’m not gonna quote some famous investors bullshit quote but if you’ve been doing (even haphazardly) for some time you know this shot is normal.

Best of luck"
03/25/2021,stocks,Hopefully you at least got to ride things on the way up last year. I missed out on it all and got in with all my savings just in time for things to fall down
03/25/2021,stocks,"Haven't lost or gained anything until you sell. Those who held composure and bought a year ago when everything bottomed out/went on sale saw massive gains. If you don't need to sell now, this is a temporary slide."
03/25/2021,stocks,Hold and wait. Sounds like this is the first sell off you’re sitting through. There’s gonna be more sell offs in the future. But buying and holding is a solid strat if what you invest in is fundamentally sound.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yea im getting fucked rn
03/25/2021,stocks,"Same here. I just remind myself that I picked the stocks I did for a reason, and that my time horizon is long enough to ride this out. Then I close my stock trading app and go outside for some fresh air and sunshine. Hang in there."
03/25/2021,stocks,"*deep breath* the entire world has been dealing with a pandemic for over a year, what do you expect!"
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m in nothing but tech and pot stocks. I’m down 25k [60%] which was literally all my gains I made this year. I was on top of the world 3 months ago. I’m happy to be learning these valuable lessons about diversifying. I had to sell some shit at huge losses just to get rid of some margin. It’s all been a painful learning experience I’ll never forget
03/25/2021,stocks,"I did read an article that said this tends to happen at the end of a decent quarter so big money can make their quarterly numbers and they cash out, also said they usually pop back up after the reinvest of the gains so hopefully that’s true because I’m in the same spot"
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s been 8 weeks of consistent red days for me. Don’t even remember what’s Green Day feels like
03/25/2021,stocks,"I swear man, it’s MMs punishing retail."
03/25/2021,stocks,Isn’t it curious how etf can go up but underlying stocks are getting crushed.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m bleeding through uncomfortable orifices. Then again, I _am_ holding GME at this point so..."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Seems like this is a lot of people's first down market, welcome"
03/25/2021,stocks,I wonder if certain market actors are selling off securities to meet liquidity demands for a certain stock while also shorting many ETFs at the same time..
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hey you! Yes, you! Really you! You know we are talking about you!

Can you just sell to make market goes up? Take one for the team, will you?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Bro I started investing in early January and accumulated quite a bit in the first month (mainly tech and recovery, i’m very bullish on all of that rn)... then feb 19th hit and everything I had been buying dropped like crazy and everything i’ve read has just said to hold on so I have, I’ve been buying the big dips too. But rn i’m down 7%, that doesn’t sound too bad now that i’m putting it here and seeing y’all are down even further but to be fair this time about 3 weeks ago I was down 30%, and i’m ngl that was so hard to HODL through, I’ve been doing this for not even 4 months and i’m already in need of therapy... HOW TF DO YALL DO THIS FOR YEARS

Edit- I also think it doesn’t help that I happened to get into the game at quite literally one of the worst times possible lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,My portfolio is down 40% since beginning of February. I'm EV and tech heavy though. Maybe I should just sell everything and go theta gang with SPY.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Feels like someone took indexes, selected all the stocks that are not mentioned much on social media in them and bought positions while selling off all the stuff the average retail investor is or might be holding. You know, like someone who has access to order flows might know to do :)

And thanks for the post i feel exactly the same - almost all except metals in my portfolio got crushed, while indexes frustratingly stay almost the same (ah, my developing world ETF also got a nice downward dent!)"
03/25/2021,stocks,Yea man this month has been a shit show . I’m barely keeping a steady number . It keeps dipping way down and then coming back up to my start. I haven’t made any money
03/25/2021,stocks,90% of people lose money in the stock market. You are just that 90%.
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m down 25%
03/25/2021,stocks,We're all getting ramrodded breh
03/25/2021,stocks,"Today was an ugly day all around, not sure why tho :/"
03/25/2021,stocks,Welcome to Biden’s America!
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hmmm.  I am up this year (compared to last year) about 31% YTD...however, this month I am down a bit.  You really need a stomach to handle the ups and downs.  I trade a few times a year.  I only buy stocks that pay dividends."
03/25/2021,stocks,2 months ago I had 5800 in my account. Now I might dip beneath 3k tomorrow. Big oofs this last month.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You are not well-diversified, it looks like you're in American equities only, so you're overexposed to market risk, country risk, etc."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Complete laymen here, but I understood that the GME shorting business made hedgefunds have to pull out of other long positions to cover their shorts. They lost billions and billions apparently.

I don't know if it could have THAT much of an effect but who knows?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Oh yes...I think a lot of us are in the same boat because we have the same or similar stocks.  It's painful to watch and scary, but like Warren Buffett said, ""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""  I have both GME and AMC and the last few days has been really shitty because unlike many here who may have bought in early, I am holding my shares at $274/share for GME and about $13 for AMC, so I have seen over half of my money evaporate in GME while waiting for the squeezes or hopefully the gamma squeeze.  I think that probably the most important thing that I have learned from everyone here is how to hold my shares and not panic when they suddenly drop like they did today.  Of course, it makes me hate the hedge funds even more and think very violent thoughts about what I'd like to do to the hedge fund manages who I view as criminals.  But, after spending many sleepless nights thinking and talking today with a good friend of mine who works in banking, I have come to the understanding that I hold my shares in a company for a reason.  The reason has to be more than simply thinking that my shares will be worth more tomorrow.  In order to be like Warren Buffett, in order to be a true investor, one must have conviction about the company or thing in which we are placing our hard earned money.  When I bought my first shares of GME in January, I had no conviction about the stock and it was the first stock that I had ever purchased.  I also bought it as it was crashing from it high just after the squeeze.  I really had no idea what I was getting myself into and I certainly wasn't aware of the risks.  Now, however, I have a  better understanding and I've done a lot of reading  and I'm thankful for the DD that gets posted here.  I do have some real hope for both GME and AMC now and I see them as companies that can be successful in the future because of recent events.  I also feel a camaraderie with my fellow ape brothers and sisters here on reddit, and I am committed to the cause of exposing the illegal actions of hedge firms and seeking some kind of punishments and justice for their crimes.  In terms of other stocks that I hold, even though I have seen them losing and some of them plummeting, I purchased them because I thought that the companies have serious potential for the future.  Maybe other investors or institutions don't see the potential now and are either shorting them or lowering their valuation another way, but it is my conviction that their future value will be undeniable.  So, looking at your stocks, some of which I own and many of which I would like to buy and hold, I think that, in my novice but educated opinion based on my research, you've made great choices and have fantastic companies, and they will perform well in the future.  The markets are bumpy now, but in 10 years it will only be a tiny blip.  This is only my smooth brained ape personal opinion.  In conclusion, if you buy a stock to hold long term, have a good conviction for wanting to own it and don't let others sway your beliefs. As for GME and AMC,  my desire is that we squeeze the hedge funds to death. Though I won't get rich from it, and honestly at this point I would be relieved to recover my losses and have my wife not so angry with me,  I will be happy for my fellow apes here who do become wealthy and do good things with their profits to help others.  I am proud to hodl with all of you here and I wish you all success in whatever you do.  Thank you for teaching me to have conviction and diamond hands!  This is the way!

Matt"
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's because you bought lots of meme stocks and/or growth companies that were severely overvalued. Doesn't matter if you havre great companies if you paid sky high prices for it. And with interest rates rising, people are rotating into value. You were not well diversified, you were balls deep in momentum stocks"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Have none of you heard of the ""hot air balloon effect?""

When one stock with mega gains pulls up the index?

But everything else is printing air"
03/25/2021,stocks,Sounds like you have a balanced approach to losing money.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It is only you. Everyone else has been up 20000% each day, and it is because they do not believe in computers. Personally I invest in commodities like corn, lumber, glue and rope. Glue has been booming recently, and I think it has to do with the rope shortage."
03/25/2021,stocks,Don’t worry. Me too!!! Should have gone with dividend stocks 😆
03/25/2021,stocks,"If it makes you feel better, I only started trading about 6 weeks ago so my entire investing career has been red so far lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,"It’s the hedges liquidating their shares to cover their GME shorts. How you all haven’t put that together is insane. The market is controlled by a hand full of people, this has become clear as day"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Knowing what I know from working in tech and seeing how my platform (TOS) never seems to move past my average cost per share, as soon as I buy, of course, but as soon as I sell up it goes.  I am most definitely a little crazy but I have a feeling that the ""Market Makers"" are using our trading platforms against us utilizing Machine Learning, AI, Neural Networks, or whatever you want to call it to manipulate our systems/us.  This is why we are really called the ""Dumb Money"". The problem is, we dont trade with each other, we put in an order to buy or sell, and the ""Market Maker"" takes that order and acts as the middleman.  Thats how they make money, by taking the difference of what I sold it to the ""Market Maker"" for and what you bought it for from the ""Market Maker"" for, ie the Spread.  I dont think this is a coincidence.  More Data Scientists/Developers work for large banks (Market Makers) and they aren't coding algos to see how they can put more money in my pocket or yours."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Same here. I’ve lost 15%of my portfolio in the past two weeks alone. It can be depressing if you dwell on it. I’m gonna sit this one out today. Just when you think something has bottomed out, nope! It seems to sink further. I’m running out of dip buying power. A lot of people already ran out of dip buying power. It’s like the big guys are trying to push the retail investors out of the market completely. Don’t let them demoralize you, hold strong and buy the dips when possible."
03/25/2021,stocks,yeah i thought i bought the dip... down 4% on dip buys
03/25/2021,stocks,"That is NOT a diversified portfolio. 
All stocks, all US, no real estate, no precious metals, no commodities, no fixed income. You are riding the biggest bubble in stock market history, that is also denominated in a USD bubble. Google cape ratio and M2 Money supply charts. Pull out some of your 2020 gains and put them in hard assets (silver, gold, land, cash-flowing business)"
03/25/2021,stocks,This is because of Citadel and friends shorting ETFs in the Russel 2000. They are trying to keep Gamestop from exploding.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Had more than doubled my ante, am now down from day1"
03/25/2021,stocks,I was +15% but now it is -20%. My overall portfolio. And most my money is in ETFs.
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s the stock market... it doesn’t always just go straight up all the time.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Retail darlings are being targeted in all sectors to shake out the market. It touches all sectors, the more prominent “Darlings” are getting whacked more than others. 2 prong approach. Big boys Taking the gains of the small investor and gain control of the market. Most weaker hand mathematically will sell. Due to simply not being able to mentally weather or have the back up Capitol to continue. It’s very deliberate. Big money is patient because it can be. 

The real question is, how long are they willing to go on? Also, are we really correcting to a point of true fundamental balance. Both are very scary. Been a small investor for about 5 years. Analyzed previous years data before I got started, the run up we experienced in 2020 was special and not the norm. Inverted, sell offs like this are also not the norm. I predict a more balanced rise in the short term to bore retail investors to death. 

Not a financial advisor, just a paper chasing ape."
03/25/2021,stocks,Think it applies generally. Gotta wait it out but I'm getting out if everything China....
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s all ok. Everything is just on sale now right
03/25/2021,stocks,seems more blood bath again today :-((
03/25/2021,stocks,"The normal ""casual"" kind of investing will get you killed in this kind of market. You have to either be constantly monitoring it (i.e. trading) or else just pick a portfolio strategy and tune out the market for the next few weeks.  Watching it and adjusting every few days will lead to mistakes and losses. 

I've been taking the first strategy, selling covered calls against some of my long positions  at a strike near my long entry point. It evens things out. If things start moving up I'll cover those at a slight loss, else I'll just leave them to expiration, worst case is I get exercised which would be breakeven. It doesn't work for every stock, and you have to watch it constantly."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I lost 50% of my portfolio value, I'm in High Risk Growth Stocks."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Seems to be a correction, like was the one during 3 last monts of the year where FED started to increase the rates"
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah it’s not just you. My portfolio goes up slightly when indices rip and fully follow them when they go down. Buy the dip and forget it for now I guess
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m up 89% the last three months and down 27% the last week the fucken way she goes, sometimes she goes sometimes she doesn’t"
03/25/2021,stocks,Its not a loss until you sell. Diamond hands.
03/25/2021,stocks,You shouldn't be more than 25% exposed to one sector
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yet, when I look at most stocks that I keep an eye out for (in tech, pharma, retail..) everything is at all time high...."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Down 10k , still positive for the year but it hurts. Could have used that money towards my refinance on my house 😭"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Imho you’re taking risk by not diversifying enough. The companies within your sectors are highly correlated. Although you are diversifying against individual company risk, your sector risk is high. Just buy a few etfs based on some portfolio theory modeling and sit back and get another hobby."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I started investing right before this dip, and I've seen my money just constantly vanish.

It's made me feel very discouraged and like I just want to give up and pull it all out and put it in a savings account like before, but I'm not because I know this is all temporary.

But damn, is it demoralizing to see everything turn red right after you buy your first investments.🤷‍♀️ I'll just keep putting more money in, and hope it recovers again."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah its really weird how when the entire stock markets goes down your stocks also go down.
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m down 60% on 25k less than 100k annually. I’m fine 🙂
03/25/2021,stocks,"What it all comes down to is order flow. Orders flow into the institutions. Just a general observation, the institutions have a massive advantage because they see the deal flow before retail investors do. Before the opening bell, they recognize the positions taken, figure out where they can make the most money (because making money for shareholders is the #1 priority) and try to front run either with the flow or against it. Their purchasing power is massive. Then down the road, we hear a headline that tells us a big institutional firm gets hit with a massive fine for this or that. If during the time of question, an institutional firm makes $5 billion and gets hit with a $50 million lawsuit, its worth it to that firm. They keep doing the same things because the revenue earned outweighs the the fines. Ever wondered why barely anyone in the big institutional firms went to jail during the Great Recession of ‘08? Bernie Madoff ran a pure Ponzi scheme but I am talking about the institutional firms: JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs etc..."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I've been getting slaughtered as well but I want to point out that your portfolio isn't actually diversified that much as these are almost all tech related...
I have 3 tickers that are all green outside of tech, 1 green energy, 1 biopharm, and 1 oil, all green. 
Wallstreet isn't happy about retailers ganging up and IMHO the MM are out manipulating to get money back. The bond thing is clearly too shallow of a story after good news from the Fed. The excuses that wallstreet is moving slower to recovery than the economy? 
Usually I don't find myself to be a conspiracy theorist but after the huge losses with shorts recently its hard to imagine the big guys *not* looking for blood in the water. 
Basically anything super green on a 6 month chart is red right now, but if you look at anything that didn't change momentum on a 6 month chart it's seemingly unaffected."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It is you. There are 3 games in investing:  


1. Buy low sell high.  
This is where you ignore value factors and just try to guess market movements in the next few months. Holding anything more than a few months is literally a gamble, if you don't base your convictions of actual business value.  
My guess is you bough what you thought was a low, but probably not really, and now you're bleeding. Any and all options, shorting and margin trading falls into this category.
2. Value investing.  
This is where you actually look at business value and try to predict the present value of all future cash flows in the next N years. Then you find a conviction about the current price and a signal: BUY or SELL. This is much more difficult and requires a lot more patience, skill and time than (1).
3. Use ETFs, mutuals or other types of professional portfolio management."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m blown away that people are complaining rather than embracing and buy more. Businesses that have been overpaid might be at a discount, fair price, or still overpriced. Personally, I have been loving these days that continue to occur on a biweekly basis. This is somewhat Black Friday for the stock market. If you purchased intrinsically good businesses, there shouldn’t be a worry for what’s currently happening because you’ll benefit greatly tomorrow.

Edit: if you don’t understand the businesses that you’re buying then you shouldn’t buy them. Buying strictly for its market price is a bad idea. In a bull market you’ll always look competent but if things don’t continue going in your favour then the guess work will ruin you."
03/25/2021,stocks,It's not just you. Crypto stocks were holding up my portfolio but now they too are tanking.
03/25/2021,stocks,New to investing. I watched several stocks for a few months and thought I had planned a good price on each investment to buy in and almost as soon as i bought my shares everything started going red. Im holding but I have to tell myself to stop looking and just be patient because it messes with my head when keep checking all of the time
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm getting fucked too. Hang in there.
03/25/2021,stocks,No. It's not just you.
03/25/2021,stocks,"This thread is making me feel much better. Knowing that I haven't done anything wrong, that no one really gets why this is happening, and that we're kind of suffering together has really helped me."
03/25/2021,stocks,Down another 4% already today. LOL. I've lost like $45K in the last couple weeks. The stock market is fake.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Guys, if you are investing for the long term, pick a company that you like to own and buy into it over time, when it's dipping, buy more and when it's rallying buy less. Average out your investment and hold. Time IN the market is better than timing the market. Paper losses mean nothing. If you bought a house yesterday for 300 k and I came along and said, Meh I would give you 150 for it, you would laugh at me. The stock market is the same thing. Because your portfolio is down today means nothing until you panicked and sold. Would you panic and sell your 300k house for 150k the next day because of my comment? No. So, act accordingly when it comes to your portfolio."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hot take from someone with 0 experience but get ready to get ultra fucked. The theme in the financial markets is that people are going to go ape shit and spend money like there is no tomorrow. S&P 500 index has a P/E Ratio of something like 45. 

These people are crazy, the market is not going to drastically recover and surpass what it was before for a decent while. GDP even with absurd amount of inflation from stimmy isn't even pre Covid levels. I can't tell if wallstreet is out of touch/in denial/ or just absolutely insane."
03/25/2021,stocks,"EVERYONE RELAX, I FIXED THE MARKET FOR YOU.  I just cashed everything out, so it should rocket back up now before I can react.  You’re welcome.

I can’t feel my legs."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Blame the hedgies behind the GameStop shorts.

Just yesterday that shorted the ENTIRE Russel 2000, every single etf with GameStop in it.  Because it’s the only way they have left to try and attack GameStop to try to lessen their losses.

These past few months I’ve seen stocks plummet that should’ve been mooning, with no just cause.  Other stocks seemingly kept at an all time low when they have perfect fundamentals and ERs.

These greedy bastards that control the entire market will be held accountable.  And as much as people are probably sick of GameStop, it will hopefully reshape and retool how the markets work so we don’t run into this problem again."

I honestly think it has to do with what’s going on with GME. The hedgies are finding other ways to short the market and in order to short it, they need funds and everything is taking a hit

03/25/2021,stocks,Hedgies are liquidating to finance GEE EMM EEE
03/25/2021,stocks,"It’s because HFs are selling their positions elsewhere in order to short GME? GameStop is experiencing incredible retail sentiment and social media exposure. Low volumes (Yet the price continues to drop. AKA market manipulation) and weird volatility. Right now it’s dropped to a hot $133 which according to specialists is undervalued. And according to some DD is worth (and is likely to squeeze) to $1mil per share plus. I’m only a smooth brained diamond handed ape 🦍💎🙌, but maybe you guys should just buy a ticket and hop on before you miss the rocket..

Im not a financial advisor"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah I decided to sell most of my stocks and put it into GME, since it seems the volatility will settle once it finally squeezes"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Then the hedgies finally cover on GME and everything returns to normal, until then expect this every week, while they sink everyone with them."
03/25/2021,stocks,The entire market is down because GME is a black swan that will likely bring down Citadel. Today they shorted the entire ducking russsel2000

03/25/2021,stocks,.......Maybe try buying and holding $GME..... not financial advice
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you are pairing your stocks against the US Dollar it's due to the dollar losing value. The $3T USD stimulus package was announced a month ago. The US isn't borrowing $3T to pay for the stimulus package, they are printing money out of thin air which means that the USD has more money in circulation which lowers the value of the USD that is already out there. All stock values against the USD will go down."

03/25/2021,stocks,"I lost 15k this month playing options. My entire savings. My girlfriend and I were about to buy our first house and now its gone. I started trading options in December and was doing well the first month, but since February 10th I started losing about $1k a day. Its been super difficult, its not just you. Most of the time, the only ones making money are day traders and people buying puts."
03/25/2021,stocks,stock changes day to day accross sectors is here say. Invest long term. This past year i'm up 200%. Realize that's not sustainable and there will be a pull back.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You're not alone, I lost 25k in Ark funds, which is mind boggling cause that's supposed to be a safe bet. Everything is just tanking these last few weeks.  Also it spooks everyone it when Powell speaks"
03/25/2021,stocks,Same here. Down 30% but just keep buying the dip. It’s sale time
03/25/2021,stocks,I guess the market was kept up artificially and you were welcome to stay and enjoy the buffet until your stay is up and and the party is... crashed.
03/25/2021,stocks,"For me , I do the opposite of what the stock is doing , when it goes up , I short , when it goes down , I long . Same with options I buy calls on the downside , puts on the upside , seems to work much better for me , it’s the only reason I’m up so much . And previous losses was all due to me buying in the direction of the where the stock is going and I always ended up buying at the top holding the bag . When stock is up one day too much , it will be down the next , if it didn’t come down tomorrow it will come down the next day , so I play shorts and options ."
03/25/2021,stocks,"""Tech Wreck"" started last month on overvaluation concerns with peak Feb 9-12. Then, selling in tech sector and then small caps and Russell 2000 and midcaps being sold off - same concerns.  The bottom was hit Mar 4-5. Then, there was a very weak rebound, and now the retest. As of today the Nasdaq is holding above it's early Mar lows, but the Russell 2K is at the lows. The Dow and S&P are also above their early Mar lows. The small cap 600s and midcaps have been stellar winners for a year, along with the ""smart"" ETFs - including the ARK funds. Seems like TSLA began to stall in the mid 800's, then slowly began to fall, and this took the rest of the tech stocks along. AAPL peaked in the low 140's then faded. The next few days are critical. IF the Russell 2k can't hold it's early March lows, and the QQQs break to new lows then we may be in for some additional selling. The only sector that is showing some life is the semiconductors. There is a worldwide shortage of chips and good news from Intel. Still, that sector has been in some pain in recent days as well. All of my best technical trading systems are OUT now. This isn't as bad as last March, but it is certainly a big correction. The tech stocks  do drop 20-40% every once in a while, but they always come back - eventually. The buy and hold crowd just takes this in stride. Like you, and most here, I took a portfolio value drop after early Feb, then had a partial rebound, then back to new lows again. These corrections are never fun - it's very tempting to sell everything and just go back to sleep. Probably not the best strategy if you intend to buy low, sell high. Not easy to do."
03/25/2021,stocks,Well it seems like the market has been heavily inflated over the last year so I don’t think this should be particularly surprising.
03/25/2021,stocks,You should sell and buy gme. Then come back and cry about how you missed being green lmao
03/25/2021,stocks,I pulled out. Paid some stuff off and I’m going on vacation. Still have my 401k and my wife’s 401k thats in broad sector ETFs and I’m not messing with those.

03/25/2021,stocks,I pulled all of my stocks a little over a month ago. I read up on some sort of possible crash so I sold out fast and plan to buy back on the lower ends
03/25/2021,stocks,"I know it's not a popular opinion on here but the HFs and ETFs involved in the ongoing Gamestop saga have been liquidating other assets to play the game. It's been wreaking havoc, taking millions if not billions from regular long plays and putting them into shorting other stocks (including ETFs holding GME)

It will be like this, and likely worse, until the Gamestop stuff explodes and the dust settles"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Stocks went up because the overall amount of money invested in the stock market increased. Stocks are now going down because that amount is decreasing. Long term, I expect it to increase; but things are hazy right now. The FED is the joker in the deck & is capable of anything"
03/25/2021,stocks,Lol imagine not realizing this is because of same major hedge fund fuckery over GME.
03/25/2021,stocks,Biden takes over and market seams like it’s getting crushed daily

Either sit out when we go high and wait for crashes or stop looking at it.  3 years goes by in a flash and those green days will come.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Yep, I thought it was just me.  I am getting beat up across the board and not able to figure out exactly how that could be happening.  Others tell me they are down but.... I AM DOWN everywhere the last month.  Ouch!!"
03/25/2021,stocks,I think the issue lays that youre investing in big tech but anyways during these times when everyone thinks the market is going to crash id be investing into put options.

I started with $16,000 and I’m down to $13,000 now. I won’t say I’m worried since I’m fairly confident with my holdings but it’s been depressing to have any plays I make gains on be dwarfed by the market tumbling. 

I don’t have any advice to give since I’m not an expert but if you’re confident with your positions, I’d hold. The market doesn’t seem to have any reason to fall much longer if we’re truly in a recovery period."

03/25/2021,stocks,"I've stopped checking every day the way things are with my portfolio after a few nice wins with crypto mining and weed stock, the rest are down 20% min.

It's not a loss until you sell. I just hope as covid slows they start to rise. I made a nice bit with Cineworld UK but they've sat still for weeks since I sold."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Things is, institutional investors don’t manage their holdings like you and I do. Even a 1-2% change means millions of profits or losses. Funds have customers to satisfy and internal measure weightings to consider, and this magnifies risk-aversion. Because of this they trim and manage and buy and sell with other factors in mind, much more readily that we do.

Price decreases = more sellers than buyers.

Price increases = more buyers than sellers.

And selling can happen for millions of individual reasons: Margin calls, cashing profits, liquidation, change of mind, astrological readings, profit trimming, etc. All these more or less rational than the others. Thing is, we can’t know for sure.

Also, medias love to create narratives and infer rationality and logic in a collective market where it really isn’t one singular logic at work. « The market decides this and fears that » like you read in your daily newspaper is a fallacy. It’s like the political pundits reading election results and inferring a « clear » message given by « the electorate » from the millions of individual votes with next to no collusion or inherent logic from one another."

You're telling me that if I bought MGM and Mariott stock I'd be doing better than what I currently am doing? What the hell is going to happen when things open up? Do MGM and Mariott go up massively simply because they are now where they were before? How can they both be doing better SP wise now than before the pandemic? I need answers dammit.

03/25/2021,stocks,I feel your pain.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Same.  I keep thinking I created a great portfolio I'm not trading out of it.

The nasdag is getting hurt day by day even if there's a decent day, there's a plummet.  I'm holding at this point.  I sold some stuff last month near the top.  I kept cash on the side so I can make it through the downturn, even if it lasts 1 1/2 years.  I need to hold to get to LT Gains."

03/25/2021,stocks,This is what I don’t get. Nothing makes sense. I’m hoping it’s just a March correction as I’ve seen people mention it has a tendency to happen like it does in September. It’s what I’m telling myself anyways.

03/25/2021,stocks,"I honestly think it seems to be hitting the stocks that retail investors are most involved with. This also coincides with a huge recent bump in retail investors over the last 6 months reaching a fever pitch recently. Someone smarter than I will have to do research on the truth and correlation though.

The fact that SPY is trading flat but all of us in a multitude of sectors are down kind of speaks to this. If SPY isn't going down the money has to be going somewhere, it's just stocks that not many retail investors were interested in."
03/25/2021,stocks,Also getting wrecked. Been opening lots of new positions with solid companies on the dip. Too deep in margin at this point haha
03/25/2021,stocks,Compare the small loss you've experienced to the insane growth the market has experienced since the crash in March last year. It's pretty meaningless to just analyse a tiny snapshot of the market and drive yourself into a panic over nothing.

03/25/2021,stocks,Market corrections take between four to five months to go back to previous levels supposedly.
03/25/2021,stocks,"S&P is up \~75% the past year, so the market needs a break.  There is  most likely going to be sector rotation away from large cap growth tech and towards large cap value, financials, utilities, real estate, and maybe energy/commodities depending on rates....the next 12 months just won't give you the same returns as the last 12.  We can't reasonably expect that.  But you can play the rotation by using ETFs to weight your portfolio in favor of value and away from high multiple growth.  Even so, I would expect only 5-10% gains.  If you stay in large cap / high multiple positions, you may be down in the next 12 months. Same if you are too weighted in pure ""reopening"" stocks or meme stocks.   Stick to a value portfolio, focus on sector diversification, including the more ""unloved"" sectors and names of the past year, and hang tight."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not just you, I’ve lost a shitload."
03/25/2021,stocks,"They are all stocks of companies. You have to find something that goes up when equities go down. Like an inflation index, another country's index, commodities, materials. Since bond yields are too low treasury bills are out."

03/25/2021,stocks,Same. I'm down 20% since January.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Cant really say i feel the same cuz my main portolio is risky growth plays (though diversified to some extent... pltr, gnog, medical LSD, clov, tsla, even spyg is down 4% for me).. the only stock that is up for me is PSEC and thats my fucking dividend stock. My only option is to stay patient on most of these plays cuz i firmly believe in the growth of most of these companies"
03/25/2021,stocks,"You benefited when it went up last year against all expectation to levels that did not match the fundamentals, based on Fed policies."
03/25/2021,stocks,I am  in the red as well when I looked this afternoon...... Even my CYDY with no new news dropped again. Grrrrr... I think that I will not look for awhile and see if that helps my soul.
03/25/2021,stocks,"OMGOSHHHH thank you for posting this.
I'm glad to see that it's just not me. 
Let's hang in there and ride this wave out."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I always wondered if you aren't winning the gamble on shorts/puts, if a too diversified portfolio just ends up going sideways. No real gain but hey the roth ira does have tax advantages. Yippee."
03/25/2021,stocks,Google portfolio alpha versus beta. People confuse their performance in a good market for alpha.
03/25/2021,stocks,"My tech stuff got hit really hard but my defense stocks are doing well. Overall still green but it was hard seeing a 20% gain on my tech slip into 2%, but I'm holding long term for the next 5 years so not a huge deal."
03/25/2021,stocks,Same here. Thank you for sharing that. Its not easy to sleep these days.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Tsla ..when tsla goes down everything ark holds goes down. 

I've charted this for so long now I stay clear of all of ark

If I had the dough like Michael burry I'd short everything in ark right now"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I feel better now. Same observation here.

I'm reasonable diverse, with a bit heavy exposure to EVs, especially TSLA.
Fortunately i rebalanced and sold 1/3 of my TSLA in January when it was at 870. 

But everything else is going down slow and steady .

I've actually started shorting PENN today. Let's see if that strategy works"
03/25/2021,stocks,"My only greens are KO and PEP.

The only other one that has gone green is a company I was waiting for prices to drop in."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm at -25%. I'm thinking about blind folding my poodle's eyes and letting her do my picks from now on
03/25/2021,stocks,"Me too, I am underperforming the broader market, I am heavy in tech and bought lots of similar company in EV and renewable.

I am honestly thinking to sell off everything and just by SP500 dividend etf now... so depressed."
03/25/2021,stocks,down over 50k from ath. legit woudldve been better holding s&p
03/25/2021,stocks,My boring dividend shit has been outperforming my value stuff. IBM has been crushing if this month especially lol.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I am constantly telling myself to sit on my hands, I’m so psychologically unable to stop thinking about selling and stop the bleeding but as soon as I do that I know we going to bounce back, weather the storm it won’t be like this forever"
03/25/2021,stocks,"What’s really keeping me up at night is how brutal the effects are on stocks, particularly small caps, but without an obvious and huge negative catalyst. You know, like Y2K or a housing market crash or a looming pandemic.

Bond yields? Really? Like it doesn’t mean nothing, but I can’t grasp how these seemingly modest to moderate increases in bond yields can rip apart the whole market. Is this the first time bond yields have risen .2%?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Manipulation
03/25/2021,stocks,"And in a year's time you'll have OP coming back and whining how he wish he had bought the dip. Seriously, I dont get you guys sometimes. The stock market is not some sort of a super high interest savings account where you never lose money and you are entitled to 10+% return every year. There's going to be bull runs and there's going to be bear runs. What's even more hilarious is that OP have a bunch of largely safe stocks that should be the type of portfolio that you buy and forget until retirement, yet he's checking it every day and crying a tear when it goes red. Honestly, just sell it all and YOLO it in GME and save us the trouble of reading this drivel on a legit investment sub."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's not you, bro. We're in a 10% corecction. My gains for 2021 are all gone. Hurts like crazy but let it ride, man! If you can afford buy more, if there's a dip and based on your time horizon asses when it'll be a good time to  rip what you saw.  I've seen a lot of stocks there on your portfolio but if I were you I would jump on some quality ETFs and/or mutual funds. Not telling you what to do as a financial advise but this is what I would do."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Welcome to stocks, its like putting your nuts in a vice but without the payoff."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You're in the same boat as everyone but the rich folks. 

You've dropped, I've dropped, everyone's dropped. 

Don't sit here overthinking stocks.  Don't sit there checking it five times a day. Unless you're buying for day trading, you're in for the long haul. Don't let a measly few days get you down. 

These companies aren't dropping because they are terrible, they're dropping because the market is. 

Stop checking and try you best to relax."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yep same boat
03/25/2021,stocks,"I dropped a lot over the previous three weeks, but this week I'm green. Mix of shorting and longs. Only buying when something looks really beaten up or has a big catalyst. IMO the market hasn't even seen the tip of the iceberg. The Fed won't even try to fight inflation. Every time Powell goes in front of the camera to tell us everything is okay, the market remains bullish for shorter and shorter durations, like a junkie who needs bigger hits to get the same high."
03/25/2021,stocks,"As you said, if you hold long term it doesn't matter. As long as you buy regularly your average will be good in the long run since you'll buy high sometimes but also at the lows. The stock market often doesn't make sense, but at least you know that in the long run you should get at least decent returns."
03/25/2021,stocks,Same here except it's like 10% per day.
03/25/2021,stocks,"March has been more red days than green for me, but the green days have been HUGE leaps compared to the many red small days. Even so, the red days chip away the gains before another big jump happens.



I saw a chart somewhere for the last 50yrs(?) March average has been negative. I don't know if the stats are correct, but having that thought has been helping me. Not that I ever planned on selling anyway.


Edit: March average."
03/25/2021,stocks,Im down 50% on my trading account. My last good trade was some apple calls about two weeks ago. Everything else down hill from there
03/25/2021,stocks,"We aren't even back to the levels we were at in early December. Yes it's been going down, and it will probably continue to go down, but that's just the state of things right now. Your measuring stick should be the overall return of the market. If your portfolio is outperforming the market even by just a little bit, that means you're doing good. Even if that means that your portfolio is down less than the market is down."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m not concerned about monthly changes. When I buy stocks, I think of where they will be years from now. You should expect your positions to be undervalued every now and then. If they are strong companies, you will win in the end."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, absolutely. I'm down 50% this month. I'm options-heavy so the leverage translates to higher risk, but I can't seem to even scalp plays to regen some P/L. Had some luck in these weird NFT things in AH/Pre, but that's the most gains I've had since early Feb."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hi, yes, I'm in a similar boat. You are much more diversified than me, as I'm still learning and quite a beginner. But I've also experienced a bit of a loss, but I am aware of this March dip and hopefully things will be bouncing back up."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm absolutely with you. I'm down about 20% on the year so far, it's horribly disheartening. But just gotta keep the grind, keep the faith. Keep a clear eye for when it eventually rebounds."
03/25/2021,stocks,Everything is down for me as well
03/25/2021,stocks,"You're not as well diversified as you think. Tech stocks are largely moving together toward the downside right now, and your portfolio includes some of the biggest risks in the market- PLTR, TSLA, UBER which are all trading at high valuations compared to earnings, and BABA & JD which are exposed to China, at risk of China's heavy regulatory hand and the terrifying prospect of becoming off limits to US investors.

Meanwhile, Travel and Retail-- sure, they're recovery plays but tit hey could be slow to come back. Some of these are near pre pandemic valuations that were already pretty elevated.

What isn't really here is where the money is going--into value stocks. Besides your financial stocks, you are heavily leaning toward large cap growth stocks that are getting slammed right now. If you had balanced more with value stocks, you'd see less of a dive."
03/25/2021,stocks,You're overweight tech. Ive called for a crash for tech and heavy rotation to commodities since 2020 was a year early but could be playing out correctly
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you like the stocks and the fundamentals are still the same, think of this as a discount and buy more.

Not financial advice but this is what I’d do."
03/25/2021,stocks,Well at least now I know it's not just me 😭
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm in the red 17% The only thing still green is XOM
03/25/2021,stocks,"Just a thought but why don’t you hedge your bet with SRTY. Pro shares ultra short Russell 2000.

If the market goes up to say record levels then this stock drops like a rock. But when the market corrects itself and tanks, this one shoots up. This year it has traded between $9 and $200. Currently $12 a share"
03/25/2021,stocks,Lucky only 2% hold on
03/25/2021,stocks,Welcome to a bear market.
03/25/2021,stocks,"90% in index funds, 10% to play around with, down a couple points."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Same. I keep buying when things drop so I’m not too stressed but damn it IS disheartening to constantly just... RED!!   

Haha. I don’t know. At this point I’d settle for PLTR just dropping 1-2% a day haha."
03/25/2021,stocks,"im down 20% from my ATH. i consider myself pretty well diversified. However i can attribute most of my losses to AMD, PLTR, NIO, and lucid. they had all run up probably way too much, so my account probably had no business being as high as it was. my account seems go down everyday lately (looking at u, theta gang)

on the flip side, the account that i manage for my parents is full of value and dividend paying stocks. its up everyday. sector rotation blows"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Patience. The stocks you mentioned are quality for the most part. Stocks go up and down, but the quality stocks have historically gone up much more than down.

Just don't check daily. Check weekly at most. I check monthly, and it's kept me sane."
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m getting fucking demolished man. I haven’t sold yet but holy shit I’m down over 50%
03/25/2021,stocks,Ive found success in not looking at my accounts. Try it a bit!
03/25/2021,stocks,I think it's all the WSB stuff. Hedge funds are probably dropping long positions to cover shorts. Addendum: I've been getting crushed for weeks.
03/25/2021,stocks,You are not alone right now. Today I decided to sell off my larger winning positions because they had reached a resistance and some their all time high anyway. So I've got nothing left in my portfolio but some sideways movers and meme stocks. Not worth much. I intend to ride out the storm using spreads and other multi-legged options that will allow me to profit in any market condition.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Everything is down because it's been one year since the crash last March. Just look at the year graphs for all the major indexes, all the year returns are through the roof. As this fades out the markets will slowly return back to normal I hope."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm down 10% in 6 months, and even the stocks I'm watching are dropping. It's not just you, it's just a dip that'll raise back"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Broader market pullback, I imagine most people who have started investing in the last 10 years (myself included) are seeing this for the first time. Also, so many stocks were up +100% in 2020, a year with a global pandemic, so while the Fed pumping money into the market faster than it can 'print' it made us all feel rich and smart it just caused stock prices to become even more ridiculously uncoupled from fundamentals (or reality) than the previous 9 years of rock bottom interest rates had already done. So basically I think ""smart money"" is taking some gains off the table before any number of catalysts like fed rate increase, min. wage increase, new taxes on equity trades, increase in taxes on businesses, breaking up monstrous tech monopolies, increased business regulations/environmental regulations, etc. etc. gives the market a real jolt."
03/25/2021,stocks,No it's not just you.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I was doing quite well for myself UNTIL I INVESTED INTO TESLA. Literally lost 2% of my portfolio as soon as I did that. Annoying as shit. I will probably never invest into Tesla again because while I understand there are ups and downs, It's a bit irritating that I am seeing fairly consistent growth on all of my other stocks but this DOG is dragging all of my potential gains into the negative territory.

I really don't even think Tesla is a good long term stock. I'm certain that once the hype wears down and the other car companies start in on electric cars, not only will theirs be more affordable, you'll probably get more range out of it too.

But whatever. Shit happens and I somewhat expected to lose a little before I made anything. If this continues though, I'll probably go back to being a crook."
03/25/2021,stocks,Pretty sure the market is wildly overvalued right now and were in the middle of a huge price correction as people start moving from investing in potential gains (see: TSLA/BB) to investing in classic companies that have solid returns yearly.
03/25/2021,stocks,Distribution phase
03/25/2021,stocks,We’re definitely getting messed up. I’ve started shorting to at least recoup my losses.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Same here, the stock markets is making me go insane. Last week I decided to not look at it, I dont care what it takes, I will not look at it. I have another brokerage account and I am going to invest in Dividend stocks. With all of this crap going on right now, I am now going to try and move forward with making dividends my main investment. I will make it 60% or more because it doesn't matter if it goes up or down. Its safe and a high profit if its 6% or more"
03/25/2021,stocks,You and everybody else. There’s nowhere safe and if I hear the word “cyclical” again I’m going to throw up.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Maybe you should consider instead of investing in individual stocks... invest in index funds? All my investments are in index funds /ETFs and I've net -2.64% total over the last month even with my AMC YOLO. Considering how much of the index big tech (FANG) is and you basically have positions in all of them... you are probably better off with the whole index as opposed to multiple name brands. Remember its easy for a single company to fall out of favor over a huge scandal, and you aren't affected by volatility as much when you are invested over the whole index."
03/25/2021,stocks,Hedge funds are shorting the entire Russell 3000 and selling off a ton of their other positions to try to save themselves from the quadruple digit short interest they have in $GME
03/25/2021,stocks,Bro you have a pretty solid portfolio there. I would not worry about the day to day changes. Have a target price and sell there or make it a many year hold. Lots of emotion in the market is causing people to sell high conviction plays for no reason. Everything will get better and stocks will make all time highs again in the future.
03/25/2021,stocks,yeah. same here. everything I've bought over the last month has turned red. bought 1k of Disney to teach my daughter about investing and we are down 10 a share in 2 days. I guess that's part of the learning process.
03/25/2021,stocks,You don’t have any energy stocks like xom su or chevron fang
03/25/2021,stocks,"you are going to drive yourself insane if you analyze like this over a quarter. It is what it is. If you can't afford to lose the money, then you need to pull some cash out. If not, your portfolio looks fine. It lacks a little value and that is probably, like most of us the SPY is kicking our butts.. You cannot do anything about it."
03/25/2021,stocks,What are your thoughts on AAL? I bought for $17.20 thinking it would obviously shoot up with increased air travel. This week has not been nice though. Obviously the company has been losing lots of money and has lots of debt but should I hold until summer?
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s almost like stocks are unpredictable.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think there is a big crash around the corner.  I’m no expert but we are spending too much as a government and we still haven’t cleared Covid.  Our debt was way too high before it.  I’ve seen gains in my security stocks and losses on everything else.  The eviction/foreclosure bubble is around the corner and companies are going to be cutting fat if they haven’t already.  When they move to the work from home model permanently, that is going to reduce demand in office space as well as everything tied to it.  The retail apocalypse has been accelerated by the pandemic and this will continue to claim jobs.  I think we are in for a bumpy few years as we transition into post Covid life."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's not just you. I have all sectors of equities, purchased before Feb of 2021, and they have all been getting hammered. Longer term companies have been hit less, but still hit. Literally everything has been down.

&#x200B;

Hang in there."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I got to the point where I just watch the numbers move. I don't need the money any time soon and I'm confident in my portfolio so the short term swings don't really mean anything to me anymore. 

If you believe in your investments and if you don't plan on withdrawing anytime soon, then just sit back and enjoy the show. While people are out there panic selling and making bad moves, you can just sit back on the sidelines and watch.

Edit: just want to add that it's definitely not just you, my holdings have also been in shambles lately."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yea everything is insanely overvalued, just look at the buffett indicator.  It's not even a recent thing, we've been due for a correction for a while and COVID stimulus has stalled that and pumped us even higher.

[https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php)"
03/25/2021,stocks,This is why I liquidate at my mental/TA stop loss limits. I do not stay in the market when it’s bleeding.  I come in to clean up once it stops gushing.
03/25/2021,stocks,Just buy insurance company stocks and play the markets with some money in crypto
03/25/2021,stocks,"The market is gonna die with Mario on March 31st.

Please Understand."
03/25/2021,stocks,You don’t lose unless you sell lower than you bought in or the stock goes belly up. Think of everything being on sale.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yup.  I started investing in the stock market at the end of January and put most of my money into clean energy and biotech.  RIP my portfolio.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m down 2.5% in the last month, but I’m all index funds/ etf’s"
03/25/2021,stocks,"In on destruction thread.

Am sad too."
03/25/2021,stocks,All the equities you named are being invested in on leverage. They will overreact to index movement by a magnitude of 2-4 times greater.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It is a month...that is nothing in terms of investments.

I am down 7% over 1 month, but up 72% over 1 year and up 95% over 5 years. The market is still VERY strong. Stop day trading."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Just my 2 cents, but if you are hoping to beat the market then possibly you are over diversified in terms of the number of positions in your portfolio?  Maybe take some gains, put those gains in other positions you think have bottomed out."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm so glad someone typed this out. This month has been so rough.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I swear, my covered calls lose half their value each day. I usually sell monthly options but I've been buying them back and reselling evert few days, the past couple weeks lol."
03/25/2021,stocks,"There is very little that makes sense about this market at the moment; know that you're not alone, but don't despair - things will correct themselves in time. I realize it's not a popular stock to bring up here, even objectively, but seriously - look at the whole GME saga - it defies explanation and there's very little regulatory oversight to reign this madness in."
03/25/2021,stocks,Might be too heavily invested in tech. Diversify with bonds and maybe commodities. Long term you're probably fine but if you can't stand the volatility in the short term you need diversity. That's what I did and I'm happy.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You want exposure to sectors that rotate in when the sectors you have already rotate out.

That means: 

* consumer staples (Clorox, 3M, etc — r/dividends is all about this category)
* real estate (not RKT necessarily, just REITs and mREITs like NLY, O)
* energy (oil companies or crude oil etfs)
* materials (not semiconductors, that’s more tech aligned and you already have plenty, we’re talking about copper mines, metal refineries)

Good way to think about it is to ask yourself “hey what would cause my tech stocks to just fucking beef it? how do i play around that? let’s figure out what situations would see that happening, and see if i can figure out what sort of securities would benefit from that situation.”

Before anyone says “technology puts would do well in that situation,” A) that’s a hedging strategy called a protective put, be aware of the upfront cost of reducing your risk exposure and if you think it’s worth it them by all means, B) I said securities, not derivatives, smartass."
03/25/2021,stocks,You’re not the only one. Fucking sucks man
03/25/2021,stocks,"Only past two weeks for me, I'm mostly in defensive consumer stocks.

I'm repositioning my portfolio and shifting to buy some more riskier stocks on the dip."
03/25/2021,stocks,"man, it seems like no matter what I do, I'm dragging through a sea of red non-stop. I have a somewhat small portfolio, nothing even close to 100k, hardly even close to 10k. I wish I could have a stock genius that does these things professionally tell me where to go and when, and finally when to cash out."
03/25/2021,stocks,April is historically best month to buy stocks. Expect low prices.
03/25/2021,stocks,Buy the dip!
03/25/2021,stocks,How on earth do you keep track of 25+ stocks?
03/25/2021,stocks,Rip to my 2060 target date index fund
03/25/2021,stocks,"The only thing that saved me from yet another loss for the day was CVS and CVX. My CCs on my Ford stock softened the blow from that sell off, but man I’m Sitting here watching the gains I’ve made start to slowly erode. 

I still like the companies I have and I’ve been moving what I can into my investment account to buy some of the companies I’ve been eyeballing but I’m still wary of further pull backs because the crazy run up over this past year."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Everyone was expecting another March 2020 crash in the way that it fell off a cliff, no one was prepared for their portfolio to trickle down 1% here, 3% there, 2% there, 4% here over the course of a few weeks, before you know it were down 40 odd % and it was so gradual you thought it was ok lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Stonks don’t only go up, it’s been a 13 year bull run basically, besides spy’s only down 5% from its top lol. If you’re crying now, it’s going to get ALOT worse before it gets better. Learn to hedge"
03/25/2021,stocks,I have a lot of the same. I’ve lost 10% but that’s because I sold half of some when the dip started. I also made money on gme and amc. But if I let it ride I’d have lost 20-25%.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Im in the same boat it is f\*\*ken shit - im getting ripped a new asshole daily it seems

&#x200B;

im down around 15%"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Definitely not just you. This seems to be one of those phases where everything is dipping. Stocks, indices, metals, bonds, and even crypto, all going down to some degree. The only different being that stocks and indices are going down more sharply than the others.

&#x200B;

Hang in there."
03/25/2021,stocks,Fucking AMD is killing me right now ugh. Only thing keeping me afloat is APHA.
03/25/2021,stocks,Made me rethink the value of my long term holds
03/25/2021,stocks,"I started a new strategy. Basically once I buy anything right now, it’s guaranteed to go down. Futu, sklz, coupa etc. Today as I sat watching my dq and sklz getting crushed, I said you know what, fuck it I know this is going to just keep getting worse all day. Did a little TA on the price action/Ttm/rsi, and bought a crap ton of puts on them both, made 86% profit on them both by eod. So fuck it markets giving me lemons? I’ll make lemonade. Problem is now most growth tech SHOULD be forming bases, I mean I hope, because if these supports don’t hold then they’re crashing back down to mid 2020 levels. A lot of the supports I’m seeing are already at November 2020 levels.

Also I’ll add that it seems bad now, but it always seems bad and this is a small blip in your investing timeline. It def sucks to watch theta kill options in the red, ive been buying way more leaps lately. But I have apple and amazon in my portfolio at average costs of $8 and 200 respectively. I’ve basically held them forever. I held them through crazy downturns when every single talking head was saying to sell. I held them through bullshit “sector rotations”. I never rebalanced or diversified when people told me responsible people have jnj in their portfolio, not a bunch of speculative tech (yea back then having a shitload of amzn and aapl was the same as having Pltr and nio today). So have faith , believe in your thesis, and don’t let the hype machine convince you to sell stuff you believe in."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Bad Beats are tough. But patience is something the majority of retail investors don't have. In even just under a year for now, let's say Holiday 2021, you'll look back at this time and tell yourself you were drowning in a cup of water. Think about the majority of the population, who aren't investing, but you are, and that counts for something. You are not a day trader. Quick success is not your goal. Keep your goal in mind, and you will find some peace. Best wishes to you! Chin  up."
03/25/2021,stocks,"For the past month the 10 year T-Bill raised it's yield so investors moved their funds around so it seems like market is not as strong but this was clearly laid out by the feds. They will continue supporting well into 2022 so I am very confident that it will recover and make new all time highs by the end of this year. 

If you're in the game for 3-5+ years, you'll be just fine."
03/25/2021,stocks,You’re definitely not alone

03/25/2021,stocks,Everyone is down. Unless you’ve been finding stocks that go 20%+  on the day as a swing haha
03/25/2021,stocks,Threw 5k in just before the dip and another 2l since and I’m down.   Didn’t lose on anything but everything is hammered.   Even things that have good news going down rn.   🤷🏽‍♂️ guess it’s time to grab up deals.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’ve got some very promising OTC stocks that were all doing great and all tanked the minute I bought in! And every single time a positive PR comes out, BOOM, they crash more.

I think the whole GME thing is to blame."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Stocks only have impressive gains about 40 out of 250 days a year.  There has been articles about this phenomenon and that is why they say don’t time the market.

This is the first real rotation out of  tech stocks in years,

Tesla realized that Volkswagen will be a giant electric car company in a year and will be their first real competitor.

The lack of vaccines in Europe and the variants with the 3rd European wave are hurting travel.  Same for South America.

More drags on the economy have just popped up from the New Congress  in 2021  such as talk of capital gains going as high as regular income which  has pulled money out of stocks.  millionaires and the beautiful people are selling their mansions at a furious pace to try to beat the capital gains tax deadlines. People earning $400,000. Or more will likely see a 7 percent federal tax increase.

$4.00 gasoline by Summer is now openly talked about.

Many are talking about increased inflation with these gigantic spending packages passed by the New  Congress.  You get a $1,400 check but the bill adds $6,000. to the National debt for every man, woman and child in the US. And 2 more big spending bills are coming!

No one knows if the FED will be able to  keep their promise of no rate increases for 2 years.

On the plus side except for real estate in hot areas the stock market will beat other investments offered to the little people."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Well, in the last two days all my profits has been wiped, and now I’m down a considerable amount.

Thing is, there’s been no news for anything I owned (save for NIO and XPEV but those are my two smallest holdings.) so I have a fair amount of hope for a rebound.

On the bright side I’ve nearly tripled the amount of MU I own, so there’s that. Hoping for enough of a return to get back to even within the next few weeks. 

Also about to start putting more money in ETFs simply because I’m not as smart as I thought I was playing individual stocks that I have no more knowledge than your average person. It is somewhat humbling to be reminded at least some of my portfolio was speculative, and I’ve gotten shit on pretty hard from that. Though hopefully that will turn around enough for a profit.

Definitely intend to stick to what I know in the hospitality and consumer tech fields in individual stocks.

Anyway, stocks go up and down, what can you do? Y’know."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Exactly what I'm going through. I'm down like 20-30% of my portfolio and the the market is at all time high.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Reading all the comments about people picking stocks and losing badly makes me glad I went 80/20 VTI/VXUS . Yea I don't make insane gains but I also don't get insane losses that makes my life enter a new dimension. I just buy, and hold. I personally can't stomach doing individual picks so running with VTI as my long term really eased my stomach and mind. My portfolio says that if the USA market does well, I do well."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I know what you mean. I have a ""safe"" account and an ""agressive"" account. 1 consists of things like T, KO, WMT, JPM, MSFT, the other has things like TSLA, PLTR, GME, BB, BABA, NIO. I'll let you decide which is which. Obviously 1 account has been wrecked the last couple months, down about 20%, yet the other has been pretty solid, especially banks and energy. So I've been tactically selling or prepping to sell out of some safe stocks to move the money into some of the better quality agressive stocks I like. With the fire sale that's happening on some of these that I like for the next couple years, presents a great opporunity"

03/25/2021,stocks,I was told that my stocks would always go up... I want to speak to the manager of the new york stock exchange
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thx for the post and some great replies below (shout out to pman6). I should have gotten out Feb 19 on options day but stupidly stuck in. Made back some losses with raising cash in rising weeks and entering into certain themes ( semi-equipment) and some day trading. Few points:

Mix the stock structure 
1. Any stock that has no revenues is a 5 year play.
2. Those with no cash flow are 3 year play. 
3. Newly listed companies often down by half peak to trough in first year. Dip in, buy more later. 
3. Earnings - don't care because look at cash but dividends +ve, cash on balance sheet +ve, & insider buying (with own cash, not stock options) +ve 
4. Balance sheet critical - cash, debt, equity, .. many of the ""cyclicals"" have huge debt! And so many tech names have 0 debt (they instead do secondary equity offerings, I'm ok with that, but I hate debt). Tell me, when rates go up, which of the 2 will get their earnings crushed (unless their debt is decades out)? So why exactly is 0 debt tech getting crushed? Anyway, mix it and if in cyclical and industrials check their debt maturities.  

Mix financial structures
1. Bad time for aggressive options trading for most of us .. set alerts and buy shares outright .. no leverage, no debt
2. A lot has been said about how high the 10 year yield is now. Might come down Q2.. trading call options in tech in rising long yields difficult 
3. I missed the trade on oil futures ramping up 6% yesterday because I got too smart .. Suez has oil pipes down the canal to feed the oil off ships in case of a problem like yesterday (Javier blas, bloomberg). Rest of world forgot that part and oil shot up. But nothing for LNG as I can see .. I don't know yet how to play European lng (Henry hub, too much delay), probably too late now.
4. Traded options on Bac, Wfc, .. until Jan. Now worried post SLR. If they get 20% cheaper, I'd be happier to enter.
5. Airlines - I have Aaww for cargo.  I used to have Luv - good balance sheet, not intl / business travel dependent. if it gets cheap enough, will enter again. 
6. Energy's difficult. Trade in out xom, cvx and others with 7+% dividend yields but have had massive run up since summer already. Will wait for oil prices to go to low 50s first (were almost there 2 days ago) .. don't see 100 oil. 
7. Semiconductor & semi equipment - have traded (and still in some) Amat, asml, amd, nvda, lrcx, himx, amkr, cohu, plab, etc, there are so many more. Love this space. So many small ones with great balance sheets. Big ones more expensive but good tailwinds.

Last .. follow ..
1. Cnbc for themes but not names. And take themes to next derivative .. a) copper up - good for FCX, but GOLD is also 15-20% copper, whichever is cheaper. b) INTC announces boundary plans - good for semi-equip (Ps. Tom Lee on cnbc good on themes).
2. Stanley Druckenmiller - GOAT - he doesn't lie, doesn't lecture, doesn't self-promote .. he warned us early Feb to ""buckle up"" for a ""wild ride"" this year. Yes - year .. we need an AMA with him .. 

Happy trading all!"

03/25/2021,stocks,"The majority of the stocks you listed have run high and hot over the last year. Growth stocks are going to be dead for awhile now until earnings catch up. This goes for AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, AMD, TSLA (especially TSLA), and so many other popular stocks that everyone else buys just because they're big names. With AAPL at P/E of 32 and a forward PE of 27, what do you expect the stock to do? Keep going up?

Find less popular stocks that have records of strong financial performance and which are undervalued relative to the rest of the overheated market. You'll be rewarded in the long run."

Lost 10% in a couple days but still 10% ahead, virtually speaking. We'll see how the coming couple of weeks fare. At least I'm not ready to jump out the window like others who have their life savings riding on it.

Personally, I like to construct my portfolio by starting with some already diversified index funds, and then just tilting the portfolio with individual stock purchases. constructing a portfolio in this manner could have been helpful right now.  But that is just how I like to do it."
03/25/2021,stocks,Kinda smells like bacon in here
03/25/2021,stocks,My portfolio's seen better days. I tend to go for high risk high reward but lately I've been seeing all red. I thought a lot of it had to do with market volatility given rising interest rates or whatever but when I see a stock I really believed in drop 10% in a single day after a few days of losses it can get pretty irritating especially with a bunch of good news coming out and price targets near its ATH. Don't get me wrong. I was expecting a pullback but it just feels like I get in too soon whenever I try to average down

03/25/2021,stocks,"Better check on mine, but I'm way more conservative for my picks. Coming from my little, unprofessional knowledge and opinion, it would seem your investments being \~65% tech and cyclical would be a potential reason as to why you're seeing big drops?

I don't want to tell you what to do but I personally like big, forgettable (in the public eye) companies and REIT's. But I guess that also lends to dividend/value investing which might not be your preference. As a sort of humorous observation for me is that I've only owned one of these directly (ETF's probably for some though).

Either way, a portfolio like this is ought to be good for post-pandemic potential. Remember the stock market transfers wealth from the impatient to the patient!"

03/25/2021,stocks,"This is not financial advice; other disclaimers; etc.

The problem seems to be that you're picking high-beta stocks. Look at SPY for comparison: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings?p=SPY

They're only invested 1.6% in tsla (beta 2.06), they have no significant stake in pltr (beta 10.2), I don't think they hold much aal either (beta 1.85), etc.

If you diversify across different industries, you'll have less risk than not diversifying at all. But if you disproportionately invest in high beta stocks, you'll still have more risk (especially in the short term) compared to just buying an ETF. This is because the ETF is pretty much guaranteed to be much more diversified than you and they are also more likely to hold solid low-beta stocks that don't get as much news coverage.

Finally, I know everyone acts like the markets have calmed down, but we are *STILL* facing economic uncertainty. Markets hate risk, which is my guess as to why things have recently been looking slightly bearish. Add in the 10-year rate movement and, well, it's not pretty. But hey, I could be wrong, I have no idea."

Not financial advice."
03/25/2021,stocks,I've gone up 3 sizes in buttplugs this month.
03/25/2021,stocks,"OP you have an extremely high risk portfolio. 

Tech is more overvalued than its ever been. It is easy to look this up. 

Travel is still a large question mark and many travel stocks have already priced in a rebound to 2019 levels. How much higher can they realistically go when they will all have lower earnings this year and next. 

Financials— unless the company is making most of its money on trading fees this is a terrible environment for financials owing to interest rates. 

Reopening trade — most of these reopening  companies have already priced in a full recovery + expectations of mystery sales which will never materialized and are already priced in as well. Those stocks are already higher than some of them ever have been. 

What are you guys really thinking with these plays? The market is a terrible pe play right now. Get in and get out quickly. 

Don’t be a bag holder."
03/25/2021,stocks,Down 27%. Keep holding !
03/25/2021,stocks,"Just close the app and walk away. I've been doing that for the last 6 weeks or so. I never planned on selling anything at this stage so constantly checking will just add stress to my life. 

I'm keeping the part of my monthly salary I would have invested, to the side and ready to go when we see a recovery"
03/25/2021,stocks,"So part of the game is called the ""value of the market"". Stocks don't just exist by themselves, stocks are an expression of how people (shareholders) feel about the marketplace and its likelihood of going up in value. ( i know *you* know this but some readers might not)

With stimulus checks flowing and unemployment checks still circulation, there is a fuckload of gambling chips on the table.  Money is being spent now. We are in the process of recovering after one if the worst years in economic history. The time for catching on the bounce back train is almost **over**

This means the market valuation for most stocks, especially the top 100, is really fucking high. *AMZN at 3,100$ a share? Get outta here""

By no means is this a bad time to get in, but you can't join a party at 2 am and be upset when people start to leave, people got bills to pay. Alot of people made lifechanging returns this year and are decidedly getting out before we see pre pandemic prices start to arrive"
03/25/2021,stocks,We are in a peak of prices. I think everyone should have an exit strategy right now.

03/25/2021,stocks,"If you're using an app-based platform to trade securities then I can totally understand the emotional dismay you may be feeling. With these new-era apps allowing us to track price movements day-by-day, hour-by-hour and minute-by-minute, it can leave you feeling crushed when the markets are dropping, constantly exhausting your cognitive ease as you are repeatedly reminded that you are losing money. 

On the bright side, when markets are in the green you are constantly reminded of how much money you are making which can foster overconfidence. You should do what a lot of us do and that is just walk away. Unless you are adamant day trading is for you, most of us here are probably long-term investors or plan to be. 

This is reassuring but walking away when you're losing money is not always the best plan, you should always do some research into why the market is red and why your stocks are dropping, is it apart of a short-term macroeconomic trend? Or is it due to fundamental failings in the company you are invested in?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m actually doing quite well. My portfolio went down a bit, but I am definitely green this month. My top 3 holdings are K, ED, and IBM. I never joined the hype about big tech and that’s where the majority of losses are. 

I’m buying some tech stocks now that they’re lower tho."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Way up.  Probably not good that you're losing in a hot market like this, but you've got some volatile stuff in there so expect it."

03/25/2021,stocks,Currently down 22.69% over the last month. Went in big with AMC and earned a good bit before it started to fall. I didn't diamond hand it and ended up selling and reinvesting that money. Went with a lot of tech stocks and faced the wrath of the ape gods. Corsair looked to be positioned to take off but after a good earnings call at the end of February it's been all downhill.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Oh yea it's been a slaughter on my side too. I've been trying the whole PCS thing. ALL I need is for stocks to NOT go down by 5% in two weeks, and yet somehow everything I touch suddenly discovers that they're over priced by about 20% and immediately tanks."
03/25/2021,stocks,Stick it in passive index trackers and forget it.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I mean, fame-picking 25-40 highly correlated stocks on sentiment and momentum is bad active management. Actively managed portfolios rarely ever beat indexed ones during bull markets.

It’s also the point when people who bought last year’s huge dip are starting to see their returns enter long-term capital tax gains territory. I wouldn’t expect TSLA to return 500% in a year again- makes sense to sell now to lock in gains.

People could get 500% returns by eliminating 90% of their bad positions, but it’s unreasonable to expect that process to be easy."

03/25/2021,stocks,Sounds like you bought at all time high. However now that JPow is done talking for some time the markets get to recover perhaps?
03/25/2021,stocks,I feel the winds a shiftin so i closed most of my positions
03/25/2021,stocks,I know the market hasn't crashed (Yet) but it feels like one of the worst periods for a while.

03/25/2021,stocks,"I haven't checked my portfolio in about a month. 

Stop watching your stock prices. It is basically like watching volatility which doesn't help one bit.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Put literally my whole portfolio into G\*\* 3 months ago, most of my tech investments were at a peak, you know the rest. (im at 280% ytd).

Im counting on a big rebound in tec and financials right around the corner."
03/25/2021,stocks,All these increased around 100-300%% in the past year alone? Buying at all time highs is a dangerous game

03/25/2021,stocks,"Im by no means in the investment know-how, however, most of the stocks you own are pretty solid companies that will likely bounce back from the unfortunate circumstance (changes in interest rates and corona has ravaged the stock market in general). In all likelihood, companies like Google, Amazon, Apple and so forth are sure to bounce back in time. I own Disney and apple stock, and both of which have gone down almost 6-7% in this week alone, yet i have no doubt that in a few years they will have bounced back and then some. I hope you hang in there, and hold out the ride."

03/25/2021,stocks,"same here, I think many billionaires and institutions made bank already in 2020. They are probably on the sidelines with stable interest-earning bonds or certs like a stress-free 5%. The market can't be booming so fast every year. All you can do is dollar-cost average. The market will probably be stagnant (meaning sideways action) for 1-2 years (started to shift this March) before another bull run. The best bet is for options by doing iron butterfly or any options play that bets the market remains neutral. I don't really see any major catalyst that would ignite another bull run in the stock market tbh, that's why."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I love all the ""investors"" freaking out about a little drop.

03/25/2021,stocks,I went from up 20% to down 2% on everything in a week. I don’t have a lot of skin in the game yet so I’m not afraid of waiting it out.

03/25/2021,stocks,The only stock I have that has held the price is T lol
03/25/2021,stocks,"If the volatility of individual stocks is too much excitement, switch to ETFs and indexes. Risk vs reward. I am also down 20% from my peak, but nearly every tech company is in a micro bubble of their own, not to mention overall bubbling and a horrible job market. Looking at TSLA for ridiculous P/E.

03/25/2021,stocks,There is so much uncertainty out there in the markets right now.  Lost half of all when March 2020 came around and it has slowly stabilized.  It should start coming around.  People will start investing more.  All these people focused on game stock and other meme's has pulled focus from the other sectors.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It’s not just you. Since the GME spike, markets have been wary. All across the board."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’ve thought the same thing. The market has become incredibly selective and trying to own individual stocks over the indexes has hurt badly. I also see indications this has been a retail thing in large part. Look where the damage has been the last couple weeks: tech, spacs, memes and crypto. My belief is retail took a hit on their core beloved tech and started to sell the others to prop up that core. 

I thought I wasn’t that exposed but I’ve still been getting pained. Basically, my conclusion is that I have to reweight closer to the indexes."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Wait til the inevitable crash, double down, hold. I took a bath by panic selling in 08. This time I’m doing the opposite. In a sick way, I almost hope it crashes, so I can retire on the rebound."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I just got into investing about maybe 2 months ago. They who shall not be named got me into it.

03/25/2021,stocks,Black hole mate. Black hole.
03/25/2021,stocks,Fuck the market makers!
03/25/2021,stocks,I been hitting all time highs. 75% dropbox 25% crypto
03/25/2021,stocks,"Just have a look at the US Bond Yields and many Indexes that are trending upwards since the most recent crash (March 2020). There are always times where the whole market is correcting itself, even during a time-span of multiple weeks and months. We need bearish situations for further growth. People need to re-evaluate their positions and maybe shift some of their money from high risk (stocks) to medium or low risk. And re-enter the market as soon as we see a reversal signal or the federal reserve bank/ EZB kicking in.

We are still in euphoria in expectation for an ""end"" of the covid pandemic. But we are STILL in the pandemic, which is nothing but uncertainty and money getting pumped into the market."
03/25/2021,stocks,Now imagine getting into investing for the first time at the end of January. I’ve lost a hell of a lot of money and it affected me quite badly. I’ve decided to take a break and not even look at my stocks for a month or two because there’s no way I can sell any of them as they’re all at a loss.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I was doing well til this month..My investments are basically flatlined(not losing) the past 4months or so. My small day trading stuff has fucking tanked from 30% return to 0 the last 3 weeks, except for GM which I cant figure out. 
My suspicion is all the FUD with the new president...”are we dumping money into alternatives(energy, cars)?” Or where are we going???"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not just you... you’re in good company on this dip fest. Buy them if you can and eventually you’ll see green.

03/25/2021,stocks,Doesn’t look very diversified to me?
03/25/2021,stocks,I feel like the issue now is that a lot of people made a lot of cap gains last year and in a time of some market uncertainty took money out to set aside for their tax bills.
03/25/2021,stocks,Its called the pull before the throw
03/25/2021,stocks,"I am in the same boat as you. I have a diversified portfolio in Oil, travel, tech/growth, Realestate, and consumer discretionary.

While travel rebound is up from when I bought in, it is way down in the last few weeks. There is just too much noise that is being taken advantage of, especially the shorts.

I am confident on the travel rebound, especially around July - August when international travel is expected to restart, certainly September. What I cannot get is the Tech growth stocks - the fundamentals have not changed in these companies, if anything it should actually improve, yet the stocks are tanking as if I am caught on the wrong side of a pumpndump."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Down markets are when you should be focused on buying. You haven't lost money unless you are selling, and you shouldn't sell unless you need to, or something fundemental has changed since you bought the stocks and your goals have shifted somewhere else.

This is litterally the biggest mistake I see people make in the market. Seeing a down market as ""losing money"" instead of a ""sale on ownership stakes in their favorite companies.""

The market is going down because institutional money is risk (or more accurately volatility) averse and is shifting back to bonds markets which is the most idiotic thing you can do. Who cares about 2-3% yield when inflation is around 15% right now?

Wallstreet doesn't get it, and invests, quite frankly, like amateurs. Most institutional money underperforms the market, and media is driven by the need to tell a dramatic narative to keep ratings up.

If this is how you invest then you deserve mediocrity or losses. Buy into the future you believe in, every stock is connected to a company and research the company not the stock, and don't buy anything with less than a 5 year time horizon levels worth of conviction.

That is my two cents from someone who averages about 300%."
03/25/2021,stocks,It's because the hedge funds have shorted basically everything to cover for GME in the past 48 hours. Head over to r/gme and have a read about it.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm down 8% since I started investing in January. The new tax year starts for us in April. Then my #1 priority is to open a tax-free 'stocks and shares' ISA, buy a couple of ETFs, and stop fucking around with individual stocks as my main investment strategy. It's been fun but it's pretty clear I haven't got a clue what I'm doing."
03/25/2021,stocks,"My stimulus simply made up for losses, and then went way down yesterday.

How is no one calling this a crash?"
03/25/2021,stocks,The market needed this recalibration. Everything was so freaking overvalued. I feel like now we're starting to stabilize at fair value for most tech stocks.
03/25/2021,stocks,"The day I started trying this...investing thing, 3 months ago, market started hemorrhaging blood. Sorry kids. My black cloud."
03/25/2021,stocks,Had £1... now I have 10p - 💎🙌 right?
03/25/2021,stocks,Just got margin called lol. On fucking upwk
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m in the exact same boat my man. Incredibly diversified portfolio and yet I’m bleeding out little by little. Just hang in there and keep buying. This can’t lay forever.
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m very thankful for corrections because that’s when I start buying more. It’s a good time to get into a lot of positions.
03/25/2021,stocks,20% of your portfolio? Consider yourself lucky...
03/25/2021,stocks,"The indices are up, but my portfolio is getting smashed as well. Oh well, this was always expected. After the crazy 2020 bull run, this correction *had* to happen."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Using a simulator stock,invested in very diverse portfolio,lost 200k after initially gained 110k:)

By some strange reason it happened since the first stimulus pack approved by Biden,don't know if related."
03/25/2021,stocks,"For those more experience investors than myself, when would we assume a correction like this could end? I was 23k in the green in feb from 4k invested and now I’m 2k in the green... for now."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not to be a negative nancy but you're not really diversified.  All of these stocks are overpriced growth, large cap, american organizations. Even though the companies are different they share a lot of factors so the risk you're taking on is the same for each of them"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I imagine it has something to do with the entire Russel 2000 getting shorted like crazy. I think a lot of stocks in general are feeling the reverberations, and some larger players may be trimming positions to relocate them elsewhere."
03/25/2021,stocks,Lmao somehow buying stocks at all time highs leads to you being down in the short term. You gonna have to wait for newer highs.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Same. Very upsetting. But are you at Dec/Nov values? That’s my solace, I can forgive the few months of reset. 

I had been thinking the p/e multiples were irrational, anything over 65 was at risk but didn’t sell my SQ or TSLA in time and they are still getting slammed. I moved out of some riskier stocks to DODIX for the income. 

BTW, the worst hit for me is NIO 😢

And - moved to banking stocks and some gold, anticipating inflation."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's going to come crashing down any day now. I'm waiting for the inevitable crash from the stimulus checks to put anything back into SPY. Inflation is too high. The people aren't meant to have money in our economic system, only the banks."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hi,

03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m 100% cash gang right now for the past month. Sold my GME shares at $350 then bought in at $90 and sold again at $230. I’ll wait til the summer to see how this all plays out. Just not comfortable with the market right now, see it diving a bit more before a recovery."
03/25/2021,stocks,getting my ass kicked too. down 25% past week. i think we’re all feeling the pain rn.
03/25/2021,stocks,The hedge funds who shorted GME are taking the whole market down with them
03/25/2021,stocks,Exactly the same my guy!   Hold on this is temporary....
03/25/2021,stocks,"It drops, recovers some, but not enough to recover from the previous drop, then drops some more, over and over again.  It’s been pretty painful.  I would prefer just a single big drop rather than this steady chipping away."
03/25/2021,stocks,"This isn't crazy. The market, and a lot of sectors OP mentioned, had a huge run-up. Some cooking off is normal! Don't worry.

As to the reasons, I've sort of figured out two things:

1) People are getting very disenchanted with meme stocks and other retail darlings (not retail as in the sector, retail as in things r/stocks and WSB disproportionately likes). Money is coming out of those things at a much faster pace than the overall market. Where is it going? Who knows. Maybe into down payments on houses, flat screen TVs, actual vacations involving airplanes... Who knows. But it will have an endpoint.

2) Notice bond yields coming back down recently? Yeah, that wasn't magic. That's institutional money and it takes a *shitload* of cash to move the bond market. Where does that money come from? Stocks. As yields get tastier, institutions add bonds back in to get back to their holy 60/40 portfolio allocations. That also will not go on forever but it'll probably go on longer (and more slowly) than #1.

So yeah, you're having a bad month. Me too! I went from up 10% to down 15% in the past two weeks (thanks, airlines and banks!). But so long as you're positioned such that what happens this month doesn't really matter if this year is good, which is how you should be positioned unless you're posting YOLOs to r/wallstreetbets, you'll be fine. Breathe, understand where the market is, and don't panic."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Down 12% just the last week. \~20% over the last month or so.

It's not just you"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I was up 190% on ENPH a month ago. Now I’m only up 75%. It sucks but in 10 years i wont give af. Also, CHPT and other green tech is being sold off at an alarming rate. I’m loading up on a ton right now and holding."
03/25/2021,stocks,Tech always comes back
03/25/2021,stocks,"The big guys are doing what they always do... Shifting money around to extract it from all the smaller investors.

They just did this with the crypto market (still happening today). Pump it up, little people jump in, sell it down.

Think about the fact that all the tech companies are still doing better than they ever have, but the 'market' has now dropped their value by 20% or so in the last few months.

Same with Crypto. Bitcoin has had the most actual investments and legit people/governments getting on board in it's history recently, more investors, less circulating supply, and what's the reaction? Drop the entire crypto market by almost 20% in 3 days.

It's all a bunch of bullshit. You get lucky or you take your profits when you can. The only ones who 'make money' are those that control the market... And not a single one of them is here."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah man I'm down on a lot of unrealised gains. If I cashed out in Jan I'd be set for a long time but as we all know 24 months from now we will be in a good position.

03/25/2021,stocks,Same. I took an absolute bath with RIDE.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I haven't had a problem. My highest is up 60.3%, my lowest is up 4.07%/ The only one that's worth thinking about that I hold is GME but I got that for the laughs, it's a play investment."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Just because you have a lot of different stocks, doesn't mean you are diversified.

Diversified is a term used to identify the spread  across nations, the spread across company size, the spread across 'risk', and the spread across industries."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You should check out PLT. It's a small Norwegian lense company that has gained a lot of attention the last weeks. Their game changing product has a focus speed of 1ms and low power consumption, and beats other lense brands in a lot of other areas too. The CEO is currently discussing with big smartphone companies, like Xiaomi and OnePlus, to put the lens in their upcoming phones. It's not anymore a matter of 'if' it will happen, but 'when', and when it happens, you can be sure that the stock will skyrocket.

However, I have noticed it just seems to be everything is getting tanked by algos and manipulated to stay below certain points.

Now I could be way off but it just doesn't make sense to me. I guess it's the MMs not wanting to lose out and control things as they can easily do that, look at the GameStop situation.

The fact charts are in some cases identical just screams somethings off to me and it's putting me off investing as I just don't trust the system in place to regulate.

I mean the fact you can borrow shares or create ones that dont exist or manipulate by trading back and forth by a penny difference is a ridiculous concept.

I had a couple of good plays for me which has put me in a position to have a house deposit but the rest of the money I left in is dwindling and it could just be a market correction but I don't know🤷🏻‍♂️"

15% of your pre-tax income, long-term investments, grow 10% each year.  A $1m portfolio will give you after-tax returns of $60-70k and couple that with a paid off house and the dream is not that far away."

The only advice I can give is to buy shit you can hold for years and just chill out. I am down over 30% since mid-Feb and I feel you, but see this as a test on what you truly believe in. This is the time to cut your losses on speculations and go balls deep on your high conviction stocks that you think are oversold. Then come back next month to buy more dips.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Yup, what's most frustrating to me is that IMO we have had a lot of good news. I know Europe is having some Covid issues but that will probably get better over the next month or so. 

But like vaccine and cases are good for US at the least, Stimulus is a little much but overall good for the economy, you've got Powell saying multiple multiple times that they are well aware of what they are doing and that inflation is under control and will keep with a target average of 2%, employment numbers are getting better, reopening is happening and QE will remain as JPOW has said until its necessary to start ramping down and will do so gradually.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Especially tech stocks have lost a lot of market cap since mid-February. First because of inflation fears, but bond rates have since fallen and tech stocks are still low. I presume it's partially because of high volatility, which would suggest that it's only temporary, but it might also be caused by fears that we will soon return to pre-covid market conditions and that some of the profits from tech stocks, which have done really well during the recession, will be cashed and distributed between stocks that haven't done so well during the recession and luxury products (not stocks), now that the trading hype might be over for new investors who had nothing better to do during the pandemic. Also there was talk that interest rates might be raised earlier than expected (between 2022/-23), which would make it more expensive to lend large amounts of money (this also affects growth stocks more than value stocks)."

I always hate doing it because I feel like an idiot when I could be making much better gains in the market. But now I'm down 15% in the market, and it's a good reminder that putting a good share into the savings account isn't a dumb idea."
03/25/2021,stocks,the only real answer is buy the dips.  Also diversification for the sake of diversification is stupid.  do more research and only buy things that you really believe in.  And in that process you will have more understanding and confidence when the dips come by.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes in the same boat but this is how the market works, it's cyclical"
03/25/2021,stocks,It's not just you. This is why we diversify. here are a lot of good strong companies on that list to hold things together so that if one or two fail you are still keeping most of your gains.  If they all fail then its a national crisis and we are all screwed together. That's probably not happening. So it's fine. Go do some yard work and leave your portfolio alone.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's not just you.  Tech has been leading in the losses and I expect it will be a long slow recovery in tech.  For me this feels worse than the initial COVID crash, but I am also heavy in SPACs."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes my portfolio is down between 10-15% since mid February.  

A key reminder is don't listen to any mainstream media who always try to explain away every single market move after it happens, this is plain intellectual dishonesty and provides investors no value.  You will continue to see yields being manipulated so that MSM can say ""market up off cooling yields or market down off rising yields"" which is literally just code for Wall Street is running this bitch up and down because they have enough capital to run the market.  Growth isn't down soley due to rising yields, it's Wall Street getting better entry prices to run the numbers up again and dump it."

There's your problem. 

You don't really have that well diversified of a portfolio. At least not for any expectations of short term growth. 

You have mostly high profile stocks that float with short term trends a lot more than the kinds of companies you simply never hear anyone talking about on this subreddit."

03/25/2021,stocks,I went from 300k to 180k. I’ve decided to not look again until/unless the rumored 15% first time home buyer credit passes or we get a positive jobs/economy report. I definitely won’t look if interest rates jump or we get a second surge/regression of COVID progress.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I think that's a common experience, especially if you're heavy on growth stocks. My index funds have done a little bit better (\~10% losses rather than \~20%)."

03/25/2021,stocks,Welcome to a short term bear market. I say short term but these kinds of markets can lasts for months or even years. Most of Reddit doesn’t remember 2008-2010 or even the entirety of 2015. Don’t get me started on the 90s before and after the tech bubble. Does “sticky eyeballs” mean anything to anyone in this sub or is it all WSB kids who are trying to take things more seriously?
03/25/2021,stocks,Guess we’ll all just buy puts on the entire market besides gme/amc
03/25/2021,stocks,"Guys chill... this is a stock market correction, and potentially a bear market. The only people surprised here should be those that started investing in April 2020. I fear that the last 11 months has completely desensitised us. The market up to recently has been absolutely euphoric, almost everything is overvalued. This is what the stock market is like in real life I’m afraid. You are not an investing genius if you secured a 50%+ gain in 2020, you just had money in the stock market, and you should not expect that to happen again in the foreseeable future. Good luck; and Godspeed! Time for a reality check! Hold your positions (as long as they’re not meme stocks) and ride it out."

Because your portfolio isn’t nearly as well diversified as you think. If you want the safety and stability of a broad market index fund then just invest in one."
03/25/2021,stocks,Down 25% so far. Best thing you can do now is just DCA and remain patient.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Up on the State Street's SPDR for the S&P 500 (SPY), you can see how individual stocks have been doing over time. If you look at the most recent 90 day period, the SPY is up 5%, but you also need to look at the individual stocks within SPY, and there the story really differs. 

For example, Discovery is up 116.9% and ViacomCBS is up 94%. At the other end, Paycom is down 21% and Enphase is down 18%. Those stocks doing really well are keeping up the overall average."

Some things I'm up like 40%, some are meh so far.

Over all I'm pretty happy to be up 10% in six months.    I may not see the massive gaps up, but my downside volatility has been modest too.

I'm not particularly crazy about edward jones, but I also can't trust myself to hold.

I mean I had disney at at acb of $100 usd.    If I just held I would have done better lol.   I don't mind the portfolio strategy he has me on.   It's made me money."

03/25/2021,stocks,"It has to do with gamestop, when they have infinite potential loss and they start losing, they need to sell some shit to get money to cover. Amd what they're selling is their other investments in blue chip companies.  Citadel has 660 billion worth of stock, let's say they lose 2 billion shorting gme, they gotta pay that back so they liquidate hundreds of thousands of shares to pay the bills.  And that mass sell-off drops the market"
03/25/2021,stocks,"That’s probably what happens as one of the largest market makers is shorting a stock a conservative 300% and shorting more each day, the capital to do so has to come from somewhere."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Honestly, GME/citadel being squeezed might destroy the market. 
As citadel holds about 25% of equities in the market and they’re already pulling assets now to gain capital.
The market will ripple if/when the squeeze happens."

03/25/2021,stocks,"A lot of MMs, hedge funds and etfs have big positions in most of the stocks you are in. Everything is being lowered due to mass amount of shorting from gme and amc. They are transferring their money out slowly incase of a margin call or they get liquidated. They could even be selling to get more cash to short. Either way everything is going to be red for a while. I recommend you buy the dip when it all hits the fan hard within the next couple of month. *note: this is all speculation and I am retarded."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Stocks are still extremely overvalued. I am not a bear and I still look for discounts, but the PE ratios are at historic high and even the crazy amount of money being printed doesn't justify that.

03/25/2021,stocks,"I predicted a crash last month and sold everything, it’s dropped a bit since then but not much. It did go up a little but now back down, I think it will keep going. 

I put 80% of it into GME avg 280, so far my portfolio is worth less than half within a month lol, I think it will go back up though. Only apple is roughly what I sold at 123 but apple are buying back stock so it makes sense. It will only last for so long until they’ve bought what they wanted though"

03/25/2021,stocks,"Stocks rise and fall get used to it. If it continues to be a concern than perhaps you’re watching them too closely. 
If enjoy watching them closely then maybe it’s time to become a more active trader instead of passive investor."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Why do people act surprised when overpriced stocks begin to sell off and return to a fair valuation? Apple for example hit a PE of over 40 at one point, and their earning growth potential isn’t high enough to support that PE. But still people were saying shit like “Apple could easily hit 3T+ market cap by end of 2021”. The dip in your portfolio makes sense because most of the stocks are currently overvalued."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Chuck it all in GME boys, it's up like 30% today and likely to keep going."
03/25/2021,stocks,"read @CarlosTrades's page on twitter. explains how Hedge Funds are basically scorching the entire Russell 2000 index because they don't give a damn if people univolved in $GME get fukt as long as they make some money back to cover their shorts.

it's sick & twisted. crashing a whole index, artificially deflating the share price of GME by ACTUALLY deflating the prices of all stocks in that index. but since it is artificial, these share prices will eventually return to the point where people don't lose their life savings in one fell swoop. if they hold thru the dip, which hedgies are betting on us not doing across the board.

Raven, a six-year-old chimpanzee, became the 22nd most successful money manager in the USA after choosing her stocks by throwing darts at a list of 133 internet companies. The chimp created her own index, dubbed MonkeyDex, and in 1999 delivered a 213 per cent gain, outperforming more than 6,000 professional brokers on Wall Street."

03/25/2021,stocks,Please go buy sqqq
03/25/2021,stocks,"Just buy and hold. Don't look at it daily, don't try to time it, don't think about it. I bought in right before the market crashed like 20% when j initially began a couple of years ago, and every day I felt like the market was personally out to get me, there was just no way it went down AGAIN?!? Now, multiple years later, im up a good 40% on that initial investment. (simply holding worldwide index fund)

Take a deep breath, close your apps and stop reading financial news and come back a couple years from now and everything will be fine."
03/25/2021,stocks,Please let me know of your next plays!

03/25/2021,stocks,"Bruh, I know this goes against the prevailing philosophy of this sub (obviously), but this is why you index. Strong majority of stock pickers do worse than market average. Put everything you want to invest in a total market fund and go jerk off. It'll be ok."
03/25/2021,stocks,How? What ETF are you buying? VTI is up over the last 6 months. VXUS is up. BND is down but not much.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Like 2 months. Started out with a virtual portfolio on etoro and got a decent 7% gain in a month. I was one of those folks who sold the ARKK when it was at 155 something and sold a decent amount of NIO at 60 something. Also the NOK and BB and GME thing got it to 17%. Ever since then it's been a steady slide down hill. Now I'm at around 14% loss in my real account. So fake profit, real loss."
03/25/2021,stocks,"hahahaha yeah I also jumped into ark around 155 just days before it took a dump, I was a totally new trader and thought it was such a bangin buy given the year kathie had

still not fully convinced stocks go a different direction than up tho"

Last year my day trading was really good (with paper trading). Was so excited to make real money, but haven’t been able to turn a profit. I’ll still trade options because I enjoy it. I just relate to this post."

Also it really bugs me because every trade was time very well for a “normal market” it just always was “this company did amazing and here’s great news! Also it’s now down 50% because of all the great news tsk tsk tsk”

Like wtf. It’s bullshit when those assholes are out there saying retail doesn’t trade on fundamentals, then when you trade on fundamentals you get destroyed."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Remember 6 months ago when the world was burning but stock prices were going through the roof and everyone on Reddit was like ""Look at the unemployment, look at all these lockdowns, why are the stocks rising""? Yeah well these buyers were pricing in the economy after vaccines and now they are taking the profits. The stock market is almost always forward looking, months if not years ahead of what is actually happening right now.

In the next few months you will see posts like ""The lockdowns are over, we have full employment and we have record profits, why are the stocks still falling?"""
03/25/2021,stocks,"Since governments have discovered QE and similar stimulus, markets are now *inversely* correlated to the underlying economy.

When things are going bad on main street, governments prop things up by reducing interest rates (both *actual* with central bank rates, and *effective* with QE) - this expands the money supply which goes straight into the asset bubble.

When things are going good, governments will try to revert rates to the normal, reducing the money supply and tanking assets - this is what is happening now.

To my mind, governments should be using *fiscal* policy for economic stabilisation, but that will require a shift in thinking by our policy makers."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah it’s crazy that the sectors that make up our fundamental needs are finally being realized to be at a valuable purchasing price after everyone piled onto the technology and growth train for years on end. It makes literally perfect sense, you just aren’t seeing the value in other sectors because you’ve only been riding hype trains with other people."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The kind where people don't realize that the markets are based on the psychology behind what ""market movers"" (like hedge funds or Warren Buffet) think about a particular stock versus what individual traders and investors think. Also, the market is chocked full of traders right now. These are people who ""day trade"" or buy and sell a stock in the same day to make a quick profit. They may also hold a stock for up to a year, but usually less. They tend to choose companies based on what is trendy. Investors, on the other hand, are people who choose stocks based on business fundamentals and long term growth potential. These are people who tend to buy stocks within a certain price range which that they ""dollar cost average"" or DCA over time to ensure long term profit. They also tend to favor companies that pay a dividend. Additionally, they hold a stock for at least a year but usually five to ten or more. Historically speaking, MOST individuals lose a significant amount of their investment when they trade as opposed to investing. Those who make gains could have made much more if they continued to hold or even add to their portfolio while others sold. If you are an investor, you don't need to panic when you see red. Either DCA, buy a stock on your watchlist that took a big hit, or just hold. It's not a war against Wall Street, either. I don't even pay attention to ""meme"" stocks. Notice GME posted dismal numbers and the stock finally corrected. Just wait, more reality is coming. Most of those ""💎🙌"" are about to be 🤦‍♂️💸. Books will be written about it..."

Let it be a lesson. Going all in with either leverage or hype stocks isn't a proper way to invest. It works well until it doesn't.

Using your same strategy the same will keep happening.

I suggest taking a step back and educate yourself. The investors podcast (we study billionaires) is a great place to start for example."

Between the human rights issues being recognized with the Uyghur population, the rampant hacking, assisting Russia with the $SWI hack, and poor adherence to things like climate agreements they're set to take some serious economic recourse over the next few years. The U.S. is already working to set up a western manufacturing alliance for things like EVs to work China out of the production market, which stands to significantly harm them as is but if it's successful it will be a basis of proof that it can be done relatively easily and if it's effective it will be all of the more reason to keep doing it.

03/25/2021,stocks,Exactly. People come in expecting 10% a month forever. It usually looks more like 10-15% a YEAR. And the idea that the S&P outperforming their portfolio somehow indicates some kind of corruption is hilarious.

03/25/2021,stocks,Thank you so much for making this post. This week has been especially rough. And I keep checking like maybe there was some massive crash of the entire market i didn’t hear about somehow because my portfolio is very diversified and even my very solid ETFs are down. I’m still significantly in the green but it’s hard not to lose sight of the future with how depressing the last couple weeks have been.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m in the same boat as you... It can be kinda depressing.

As far as the indexes you’re right - it’s so weird and frustrating to have money in many of the underlying stocks and yet be significantly underperforming then still. 

I do have some money in a managed fund that is diversified across many sectors and even countries and consistently beats the market average. I’ve realised that when equivalently diversified, a 2-3% down day in four major stocks can easily be offset by a 12% up day in just one.... if you can pick right.

If I bought into only Apple and Etsy a year ago you’d be up a little over 25%. If I buy into Apple, Etsy, Amazon, Spotify, Tesla and Visa you’re still down over the past year.

If all I’d bought into is Etsy and Rakuten I’d be feeling pretty good. I need to reassess how I pick stocks clearly..."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Okay I'm glad you said this...I'm baffled. This may be a stupid question, but where is all the money going? An enormous sum of money has flowed out of those names you mentioned and I'm having trouble tracking where it has all gone."
03/25/2021,stocks,Real answer is that the vast majority if individual investors picking single stocks lose out vs just buying market index funds.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I suggest some price earnings ratio checks before you buy. You bought the froth, and I'm not surprised it's doing worse."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Has your valuation of those companies changed? If not, buy more."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It’s rotation. Money is rotating in and out of different sectors which allows for the overall market to be stable. Just look at the last two months, you’ll have a week that value is hot, one week growth is hot, banks are hot when bonds do well, re-opening got hot, memes get hot for a couple days, now we have NFT craze. The difficult pill to swallow is that it will be harder for all these stocks to go back to ATH that many were in January/early Feb since the market has just kinda hung out just under its ATH, so the market will have to not only make new ATH but break it strongly for anything else to make back its gains."
03/25/2021,stocks,I think it's because these indexes are heavily weighted in favour of the biggest corporations. If the Nasdaq drops 1pc it's generally reflective of the likes of Apple and Google dropping 1pc. Smaller corporations can drop far more without hugely affecting the Nasdaq because they make up such a small portion of the index (even collectively). If your portfolio was made up of the biggest names it would be more reflective of what the indexes are doing.
03/25/2021,stocks,"My portfolio mainly consists of SPY options. I have been doing relatively great with a lot of profit and returns but this past week, for some reason, I got several small losses and that amounted to me losing about 50% of my portfolio."
03/25/2021,stocks,I know how you feel. I started in 2008 when I just got out of highschool. Just before the crisis. Had all my savings in it. Stocks went 70% down and I decided to sell. Stupidest mistake I’ve made. Would have recovered in a year but instead I took the remaining out of my account and didn’t invest anymore until 4/5 years later. Just make sure you don’t need the money in the short term and invest in companies you believe in.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah I do the same. But always in companies that in the end I trust in case of an overall market crash. Burned myself to often for not doing that.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Market beat me to it. Wanted to make a quick buck and did get luckily successful for two months then got burned. 

I'll stay away from individual stocks from now on."
03/25/2021,stocks,favorite 3?
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m down 25% as of today. I looked at a couple SELL buttons today but never pulled the trigger. The stocks I picked seemed like a good idea at the time.
03/25/2021,stocks,">feels like I should just liquidate

Exactly what they want you to do."
03/25/2021,stocks,dont. just hold. unless they are bad stocks.
03/25/2021,stocks,I couldn’t disagree more.. but we’ll see what happens.
03/25/2021,stocks,What a reach.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Every time someone loses on a trade, someone wins. For every loser, there is a winner."
03/25/2021,stocks,“When I dip you dip we dip”
03/25/2021,stocks,Tech is down 30%. If it keeps going down that’s no longer a dip. That’s just raw anal fisting.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yep, that has been for me too, weeks have passed, I have done some trading with some success, but everything else is killing me, I've lost 30% of my portfolio value... I don't know why they say the stocks end mixed, no, they didn't, most of them lost"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hey, are you me?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I hold a lot of defensive stocks like PG/KMB/PEP, so I’ve managed to stay slightly positive during all this. I say that because I keep trying to buy the VTI dip only to find out 3 days later it’s dipping harder. Very frustrating. I’m about to liquidate that shit."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The secret is to panic and sell the sector that just plummeted, and rotate into the winning sector that just went up and is about to plummet.  Rinse and repeat."
03/25/2021,stocks,Bond rebalancing has been happening all month long.  Money pouring out of stocks into bonds by big boys like Blackrock is my guess.
03/25/2021,stocks,This kind of shit makes me think this market is off the charts manipulated to sink the retail. Fuckers 😏
03/25/2021,stocks,"PEJ (leisure and entertainment etf) was a rock for most of the month, then it turned on me like a rabid dog this week, down over 12%."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Maybe whales are making money off shorting stocks, seeing the way everything has been fluctuating. Also hearing how the market might be overpriced. Just a thought"
03/25/2021,stocks,Lmao exactly. I sit primarily with industrial stocks and they suck ass recently... :((
03/25/2021,stocks,"Me: Sitting here with JETS calls and AC shares reading investors are turning to rebound stocks.

Narrator: They aren't."
03/25/2021,stocks,"PEP, KO, JNJ, PG, HD, TGT, LOW, MMM (definitely more!) all went up the past month. Unsurprisingly these are all value plays.

Its been clear that money has been going from growth into value plays.

Unfortunately I’m heavy into growth so got hammered the past few weeks just like you lol"
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's a rotation into cyclical and a rotation out of the equities into overseas markets and into bonds. Whilst you have diversified sectors, you have not diversified out of the American market which is suffering from a bearish dollar, a government that shares views with Monetary Market Theorists, and a sort of socialist rise with the demonising of capitalism and private enterprises."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The ""reopening"" play just got smothered by a pillow--CDC says no US cruise sailings until Nov. 1 earliest now.  This is going to knock things back again.  Government isn't going to give up this power we handed it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The markets doped up on funny money & the economy is in a gridlock. We're seeing increased inflation & the Feds trying to stare forward & act like it's transitory, because that's the only thing they can do. And the big money isn't taking the bait. Everyone's just staring at each other waiting for someone to blink & give some indicator of where to put their money. Then we'll see which way the scale tips."
03/25/2021,stocks,Many of the reopening plays have been saddled with massive debt anchors that they'll have to drag around while only opened to half capacity. Look at cruise lines for example. They're massively indebted and will only open to reduced capacity and very substantially reduced revenues.
03/25/2021,stocks,I’ve been thinking the same EXACT thoughts for the last 2-3 weeks.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Its hard for me to realize this TA. Being under 200d SMA could be terrible news in some ways, it could be an company/industry/market in decline.

The positive way to see this is that they are undervalued. How do you interpret this data point?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Don't want to scare you, but currently only 45% of companies are above their 50d SMA. This is equivalent to around June of 2008. This was when the market had topped and proceeded to fall off a cliff just months later in August. I'm just cherry picking a data point, but it is one possible outcome."
03/25/2021,stocks,I’d take every other day. Feels like every day.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Why do you say that? Purely from a NASDAQ perspective or all sectors? NASDAQ is not doing anything different from other pullbacks right? Overall market,yes, it hasn't made up its mind on who is the leader and is getting chopped all over the place, but NASDAQ has lagged all along. I know, since I am 80% tech."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, but the valuations in the NASDAQ are also unprecedented in many cases. People seemed to not be paying attention to anything related to fundamentals (esp. in tech), and are suddenly surprised when the music stops. Stocks rising 50%+ in a year with no real accompanying growth is a sign of a bubble, or at least a ton of froth. 

Pretty easy to point to what has happened with SPACs to see that the markets have been behaving totally irrationally over the last \~10 months. Same with IPOs. Tons of money-losing companies that only lose more money as they grow (negative operating leverage) going up in value? That's crazy! Some easy examples Uber and AirBNB.

NASDAQ unfortunately has a lot of exposure to these sort of stocks."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah it’s out of control lately. I blame gme.
03/25/2021,stocks,Before or after 2008 you mean? Surely the few years after the crisis was much harder.
03/25/2021,stocks,2015. I think Bungee was my best performer lol.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Nasdaq is still incredibly up. Just open any charting tool, look up Nasdaq, period 5 or 10 years. This little dip/stagnation barely even registers.

If you think that’s a tough trading environment... boy I’ve got bad news for you"
03/25/2021,stocks,">I've been investing for 12 years

No you haven't."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Really makes me wish I'd held off on investing just another week.

It'll rebound, and I'm glad I'll make a pretty penny off it, but it could have been more."
03/25/2021,stocks,Bond inflows too
03/25/2021,stocks,"I agree with you. I get really angry because back in December, if you recall there were so many articles about how retail traders were screwing up the market and driving up asset values illogically. Blah blah blah.

February and March showed very clearly that retail investors have absolutely no say in the aggregate market. We're all just minnows compared to the whales. This main stream financial news narrative of how ""retail traders have changed the landscape of investing"" is absolute hogwash. Its designed to perpetuate the same system that has been creating a dichotomy of those that have access to insider information and those that don't.

The only way you can win in this game is to go with the tide, create a strategy, and stick with it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"That is just how the stock market works. It's a zero sum game. You don't gain anything unless somewhere else, others lose something."
03/25/2021,stocks,SPY is not diversified
03/25/2021,stocks,Even Robinhood gives 0.30% for any cash in your account. Better off to just have cash there and not buy any stocks haha

Well's Fargo ftw"
03/25/2021,stocks,you guys get interest?

03/25/2021,stocks,This is where they want to steer you.  The bond pricks are angry right now.

03/25/2021,stocks,Only for speculative stocks or options. It's fine to go almost 100% in index funds.
03/25/2021,stocks,To fuck it all up.. it's kind a gift too.
03/25/2021,stocks,You’ve put literally zero historical accuracy into that statement
03/25/2021,stocks,"They have literally no idea, just making up narratives to fit what's happening.  Stocks are falling today amid news that DamnDirtyHippie's cat has shat on the carpet next to the litterbox - analysts speculate that this could be a sign of more things to come."

03/25/2021,stocks,"This. My portfolio has not taken a big hit because I’ve been buying stocks nobody is looking at (K, ED, IBM, etc.)"

03/25/2021,stocks,This is 100% the best post I’ve seen about this market so far.
03/25/2021,stocks,"The market pre-covid had a very rosy outlook(Historically high) of the growth potential of a lot of companies. I get the stimmy money caused inflation, but I can't wrap my head around justifying 45 P/E ratio for the S&P. The economy is not going to recover enough/quickly enough to justify that price.

I guess we'll see what Q1 GDP numbers look like pretty soon. Maybe I just don't see what literally the whole market seems to see."
03/25/2021,stocks,I hope they do pass. It’ll benefit the country. The economy is more than the stock market.

03/25/2021,stocks,God no.   That and the whole silver thing was also a push from hedge funds and look what happened to those immediately after they rose like 20% and then got sold off.

I limit each position to about 5% save for msft aapl making up 18% combined.

I have ASML TSM and NVDA which are pretty much stable right now.

SQ and PYPL are about 4.5% each and have been hanging in.

I recently added UNH which has been growing lately and at fair value.

My 5% HD position is finally going green after a few months.

I'm about 55% tech including msft and AAPL.

I'm not worried.  I look 5 years out.  And then 10. And then 15 and 20 .... If I'm still alive 😆."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks man, it’s been pretty shitty haha ! I’ve mainly been investing w money I inherited after my mom passed away, and it’s been a bitch watching that chart decline. I’m sure it’ll go back up eventually! Thought I was being so smart with my AAPL and ARKG leaps lol."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Doesnt matter much to me. I just started this year and although my portfolio is small and I can only put like 200 bucks a month in, I figure Im holding for the long haul and dont plan on selling whatever I buy for at least a year but most of the stuff Im doing is etfs so those Im prolly gonna hold till I retire which is a long ways off."

03/25/2021,stocks,"> I cant understand how the indexes are barely down but my diversified portfolio is just hammered.

Indexes are barely down because it is way more diversified than your portfolio. Really it's everything else in the index keeping afloat while the big hitters like the ones OP mentioned that are hammered."
03/25/2021,stocks,"From what I understand, it's because things got redistributed. The meme stocks are making the whole market go weird places. I know people have charted it out, and it's like everytime GME/AMC go down, the whole market goes up and vice versa.

Too bad my go to sub has been overrun by GME  cultists
03/25/2021,stocks,Can I have his number?
03/25/2021,stocks,There is someone out there winning on the other side of every trade that you lose on. That's how the stock market works. It's a zero sum game. You only make money when other people lose it somewhere else. Correct me if I'm wrong.
03/25/2021,stocks,I’m really starting to think this is what’s happening
03/25/2021,stocks,"Dude you look at it and every day a different excuse. The stimulus package - goes up for a day then plummets. Bond yield plummets. Each day a new article saying tech stocks rally,  tech stocks down, tech stocks rally.  The ones writing the articles have no idea what's causing any of it.  I only watch closely the first hour of the day because I either know I'm getting fucked or doing OK after an hour"
03/25/2021,stocks,almost😂
03/25/2021,stocks,Sounds like a Texas weatherman.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Exactly, bc how would they know what is motivating investors to sell? I read one today that was so specific. It said that investors are taking their gains to buy other types of stocks."
03/25/2021,stocks,Or perhaps that’s how it has always been
03/25/2021,stocks,"The financial sector has been pretty good over the last month, but the Fed announcement on Friday morning really hit them hard. I have a couple WFC 5/21 calls, they were up bigly by Thursday, but they've since eaten up 3 months worth of profits. Today was a fairly level day, so I'm hoping they'll get back on track and climb out of this hole before I run out of time."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I notice going short works better in this market. Just cover your position end of the day; otherwise, these scanners will gap the market up."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m down in both VTI and VXUS as the moment. 

I’m down in everything except GME....go figure."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Lol the US has its blinders on. The rest of the world is getting destroyed. India had its deadliest day of the entire pandemic yesterday. Yes cases were going down, but that has hit a floor and with spring break cases will come roaring back. Have you seen Miami? 

The only positive news is that we are vaccinating at more than 2x the rate people thought. 2.8 million per day the past week. 1/4 of all US adults vaccinated. That’ll slow down because a lot of Americans believe their yoga instructors over doctors or are just incredibly selfish (I’m an American) and won’t get the vaccine. We are not the greatest generations. 

CCL has diluted its shares and has been running on hopium. Their cruises are mostly canceled until November. One big outbreak of coronavirus traced to a cruise and their stock will tank again."
03/25/2021,stocks,This is my guess too.  They hate the new retail trader and want to discourage them from individual investing.  Institutions are losing inflow and management fees.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, to an outsider who isn't trading it looks like the market only dropped like a point or two in the last few weeks, but if you really look at it the market is never up for more than two days and it sells off overnight constantly. Those who are actually in it are getting absolutely destroyed."
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you feel that way, why not short then? I'm heavily short this week and today was amazing."
03/25/2021,stocks,"DOW, NASDAQ and S&P500 are showing fake numbers and they’re rigged."
03/25/2021,stocks,You got it!!! Biggest scam known to man yet nobody knows and just accepts it. They’ll do anything to shake another 5% out of what they owe. Hell they kept reporting everything was up more than halfway through the day. It’s sad. They used to not make it so obvious and at least try to fake like they cared about unemployment or housing or whatever other fake thing they use as an excuse to pay out less when the rents due. They better watch it though because people are catching on and pretty soon we just might sell it all.
03/25/2021,stocks,"agreed, but stick to shorter/intermediate term bonds..."
03/25/2021,stocks,Powell flapping his yap every god damn day does not help anything either.
03/25/2021,stocks,"For my understanding that Datapoint merely mean to that 3/4 of all equities are now under their 200 day average. Meaning quite a bit of the market is red, even if the indexes appear to be more stable."
03/25/2021,stocks,if you think this is bad... imagine if it kept dropping for the next year and a half.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Many people here just got in the market this year for the very first time, so these are the worst conditions they've ever experienced. Bless them. They'll grow. We all do."
03/25/2021,stocks,"But that is the question. If tech is getting hammered, and cyclicals are also Red, how comes SPX is flat?"
03/25/2021,stocks,After 2008
03/25/2021,stocks,Ummm Ok
03/25/2021,stocks,No kidding. I'm down 73% on my ARKK leaps from a month ago
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you recall after the 2008 financial crisis they blamed the poor people who got the no money down loans for the crisis when the real culprit was Wall Street. Same thing is happening again.  They know they need a scapegoat, Credit Default Swaps are 4x the bond/asset market, and they see what could be coming. 

Someone above posted about ""money never leaving the market""...well, I've got some bad news about the money they pull out and store in Cayman Island accounts to avoid taxes and limit risk exposure to market crashes. Money gets pulled out of the market, thrown into an offshore account, then pulled back when needed for investment.  It's basically strip mining profits."
03/25/2021,stocks,This 100%. I’ll expand on the sea life analogy; We’re actually remoras on a shark. Institutional/hedge/MM money (the sharks) absolutely dictates market direction. Retail investors are just along for the ride wherever the sharks swim.
03/25/2021,stocks,Lol I lost 17.7% just this week :) good ol stonks
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but it's really hard to care. Even though there are much higher rates than the worst rates, those higher rates are still godawful."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It is literally just losing your money to inflation XD 

What the hell"
03/25/2021,stocks,In 2021?? What bank.
03/25/2021,stocks,I switched maybe two months before covid and getting weekly emails saying their reducing the rate really sucked. But I guess it still beats Wells Fargo's 0.0008 %
03/25/2021,stocks,"I mean I have 0% of my portfolio in bonds, but they're better than a 0.4% savings account with some bank. 

I have family that kept their savings in accounts like this for decades because that's what they were told to do in the 80s & 90s and are now discovering as they approach retirement that they are pretty fucked."
03/25/2021,stocks,This was my absolute fear. I had been following ARKK since May and every ATH I kept thinking that was it. Then in January I said eff-it and went all in. Really glad i did! /s
03/25/2021,stocks,This is me. I did this by converting 70%+ of my safe spy funds in my entire portfolio.  Talk about chasing past gains and getting greedy.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes, you can. When I buy market tanks and when I sell market makes the biggest bull run"
03/25/2021,stocks,Shit. And the Intel announcement today. Bad combo.
03/25/2021,stocks,I hope on god i never learn and try options trading.
03/25/2021,stocks,Same! ahah!
03/25/2021,stocks,Sorry it triggers you to be told that your guy isnt good for the stock market. It's just straight up FACTS. You know what the best thing you can do right now is? Divest all the emotion you hold that connects your identity to a political party.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Or making up narratives after they’ve taken a position.

All gloom and doom when they finished building their short position and almost ready to cover.

All positivity and optimism when they’re prepared to sell"
03/25/2021,stocks,No. Fed Chair is required by law only a few times a year but I believe after the first covid relief package they changed the rules temporarily for the chair to speak more frequently for the time being.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah unless you’re stupid like me who bought puts in April 2020 and calls in March of 2021. Only two times I have ever dabbled in options and I chose the worst timings for both
03/25/2021,stocks,That September sell off looks so similar to what is happening right now.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's not that people expect a bull run all the time, just want to know why the market is going down.

&#x200B;

Always a reason."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah its gonna suck for a few months but itll rebound at some point.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Aren't indexes usually at an all time high, with the exception of small corrections? Look at SPY for example. It's been on a steady, linear growth phase for the last 5 years. We're actually not too far off what the price would have been like if it had kept going at its slow, but steady upward trajectory."
03/25/2021,stocks,They better be. There have been nothing but tax cuts for the last few years. Can't sustain that indefinitely.
03/25/2021,stocks,I agree with you. See you in down voted oblivion!
03/25/2021,stocks,Only if the government spends our money on wise investments as they’re known to do
03/25/2021,stocks,Because the government is so good at spending money in a fair and equitable way.  /s
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s all GameStop’s fault. But seriously funds are pulling out using GameStop as an excuse for the stock market being heated up too quick
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah investors are the problem in America. Tax them. Especially the middle class investors on Robinhood
03/25/2021,stocks,Yea fuck everyone’s retirement. Amiright?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Fuck tax hikes. Government waste is unbelievable. They are useless. Musk’s companies are solving critical problems in climate, space exploration and infrastructure without robbing tax payers trillions of dollars."
03/25/2021,stocks,They'll just sell them off first.
03/25/2021,stocks,Isn't everyone maxing out their 401ks already?
03/25/2021,stocks,Tax hikes are on the rich. Doesn’t change the 401k story for them
03/25/2021,stocks,Why would it?
03/25/2021,stocks,"PMs are a hedge against negative real rates, not inflation. It's a subtle difference and a common misconception. https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=realyieldYear&year=2021"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Could absolutely dip lower from here, but that's pretty mild for btc corrections to be honest."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's the surprise. Hedge funds managers hate how we've gained money and dump into stocks. They hate that they got a lower cut-off on the stimulus.

We put money in the markets, they sell the stocks they propped up, we panic and they gain money on the puts they bought. Let it drop, call the stock away they shorted, and bam... they own even more.

Then they control it. They robo trade it in AH and PH, causing the prices to soar, sell off around 10-1030, and they bleed us dry. That's how they do it. 

Let funds settle, buy small amounts near close, sell by 10am. Rinse, repeat."
03/25/2021,stocks,"> As long as you are invested in fundamentally sound businesses you don't have to worry. 

Uh oh"
03/25/2021,stocks,What if you bought in at a crazy nonsensical high within the past couple months though? This could take years to recover if all of this say... Drops to where it was at the beginning of 2020. I feel like this is what a lot of people here are afraid of.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’ve heard this a few times before but I don’t quite get the “if you missed 3 largest positive days, you were down 105k” part.

Doesn’t missing these peak days only matter if you wanted to sell on those days? I get the part about making 170k by holding but if you’re really holding for 40 years who cares about the peak days. Are they just saying you would have had the opportunity to sell for decent profit or ??? It would make more sense to me if they said if you didn’t buy until 1990, your profits would have been reduced by 105k etc."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Instructions unclear. Bought Tesla $2,000 calls."
03/25/2021,stocks,People wishing that would happen means that it won't happen. I remember people wanting it to go down to $200-$300 pre-split at the crash and it never happened.
03/25/2021,stocks,"If this every happens, I'm selling everything and wsbetting my kidneys."
03/25/2021,stocks,"That's how it works. Just keep at it for another 20 years and you'll be fine.

These ruthless corrections are how frauds who claim to know how to beat the market get blown up. Look at the end of 2018. It looks like a random dip right? Maybe it was random but countless morons ran out of luck and then out of money."
03/25/2021,stocks,That's the point. Crypto volatility is more bearable
03/25/2021,stocks,You wanting it to do something is not a good reason for it doing that.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You’ve been investing less than 3 months and believe $1 million a share is possible for GME. Your opinion is laughably irrelevant. 

RemindMe! 1 month"

I haven’t sold off anything yet, sorta wish I did a week ago, but now it’s gotten so bad; that let’s say I sell at open tomorrow will prob be a good green day and I’ll be kicking myself. I just don’t see things dropping a whole lot more, maybe another 10% at most I hope. If you like the stocks then just hold the line!"
03/25/2021,stocks,Yes if we all could pile into a time machine and buy gme low we would I’m saying that you telling him to buy gme right now would be buying a massively red stock from ath. Not the solution. Bud.

03/25/2021,stocks,I can taste the privilege in this comment and it's a little tangy almost.
03/25/2021,stocks,That's not how balance sheets work. Your portfolio value has gone down whether you sell or not.

03/25/2021,stocks,Tell me that after you go do some analysis of their financial statements.
03/25/2021,stocks,It might be the COVID collapse that's coming back to bite us in the ass because the stock market was artificially propped up. Anyone else have this hypothesis?
03/25/2021,stocks,That's not what market makers do. Market Makers are pretty neutral and provide liquidity
03/25/2021,stocks,"You sound greedy. ""Eeeking out"" a measly 7% is perfectly reasonable. It seems as though this last year or so, and the past few months especially, people expect super high returns with low risk. 

A relatively low risk 7% is pretty good. Some perspective is required here."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I have practically no knowledge of stocks but after reading Flash Boys I feel fairly confident the market is absolutely game/rigged. How could it not be, though? That's how systems inevitably work whenever humans attempt to utilize them for temporal gain. Someone is always going to be faster, better, more intuitive and when they come together collectively to work the system and all its subsystems..yeah. Little fish are going to be begging for flakes."
03/25/2021,stocks,I don’t know if it is rigged but the market is designed to make money into more money.  By design the person with more fuel is going to get more mileage.
03/25/2021,stocks,"True, short term they definitely have an advantage and can influence the market. However long term valuations make sense. Know the stocks you own and have faith in them."
03/25/2021,stocks,No shit. Do you really think the big players with hundreds of billions of dollars at stake would refuse to rig?
03/25/2021,stocks,"They also pay for our orders, so they can see exactly where retail investors are putting their money. This enables them to apply precise pressure on us, forcing us to react to paper losses on our choices, while keeping the money in the markets and the indexes high."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The system is 100% rigged and you are correct the only way to “win” is to buy and hold.  That said, if you sell before a crash and buy back in that’s great but hard to do.  SoftBank is a good example but markets are manipulated everyday and the large institutions are able to start the outflow when it benefits them."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Actually we have advantage of being able to liquidate our positions in mere seconds. Look at Ark, Cathie is so deep in Tesla she has to come up with ridiculous 3000 price targets to be able to exit her position"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I mean market makers are making money mainly due the bid ask spread and arbitrage opportunity arising from that, not because they have so much equity they can buy low, sell high and re enter when the market dumps.


I think you may be confusing market makers with large investment firms."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm down like 10% on my stocks and like up 10% on my ETF.  I see a pattern.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Hey man, you don’t lose money if you don’t sell."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The market has been shifting faster on what it favors than anyone can keep up. If you didn’t already own it, whatever it was, you’d have lost. I’ll never stop having individual stocks, but this has reinforced my perception that I have to add more index etf’s as a percentage of my portfolio."
03/25/2021,stocks,Brother Iam down 40% I would kill for 20% loss
03/25/2021,stocks,It’s the mega caps holding up the indexes.  Look under the hood and you’ll see the rest are taking it on the chin.

03/25/2021,stocks,"Google what is an ""uncorrelated asset?"""
03/25/2021,stocks,I should have clarified. Obviously it's not as diversified. But its that my portfolio used to move with the indexes and now it does not. I'm not sure what you mean by big hitters but my large cap etfs like DIA or SCHD have performed relatively well signaling to me money is moving into the safer non tech stuff
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks for explaining your understanding. I think you are right, this all started with GME. I try to avoid conspiracy ""evil hedge funds"" narratives, but what you suggest is more in line with equal fear across the board of really nobody having a grasp and having to sell stuff they dont want"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes I pick companies that I believe have both on the short term and in the long term great potential. And then I always sell when I’ve between 5-10% profit or in some cases put a stop loss on 5% profit and see if it runs further up so I can increase my stop loss. 
However I never sell a with a loss as I trust the companies that I invest in so if I need to I can keep them for the long run to wait for profits. 
Also have a small portion of my portfolio in younger companies that I believe in, those I never sell and hope they give me a big profit in 5+ years."
03/25/2021,stocks,I really don’t care about American Politics but to blame Biden for lockdowns in March 2021 for a pandemic that started 12 months before he was sworn in is so blinkered as to be comical.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You don't appear to understand how the stock market works, so you resort to political conspiracy. It's ok to not understand and to just accept that. You don't have to speculate nonsensically to fill the gaps in your own understanding."

03/25/2021,stocks,This is the answer.
03/25/2021,stocks,You are wrong
03/25/2021,stocks,I’ve been reading these headlines for 7 years lol it is what’s happening
03/25/2021,stocks,"There have even been fancy studies that news stories and market moves have completely zero correlation.  

There is only one correct headline... ""Market sinks today due to more sellers than buyers"". 

Market headline writer is the easiest job in the world, make up anything at all and it'll be equally correct."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It was sarcastic, I know that's exactly what's happening. It's an easy way to get clicks and views. If they really knew why something was moving they would trade accordingly before the move and be a billionaire instead of writing trash articles. I've been investing for 15 years and I just ignore the news and buy index funds and a few value stocks. You won't get rich quick that way but you will get rich slowly and that is better than losing it all on a gamble."
03/25/2021,stocks,"raccoon hit on I94, oil prices surge."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Couldn’t agree more on this.  Whenever I read headlines and news I just assume the algos and high frequency trading is way ahead of me and I’m buying at the top so I tend to go contrarian.  And this has continuosly fucked me over the past 18 months or so.  A perfect example of this for me was shorting Zoom in April.  The virus had been around for quite awhile globally so I assumed the run up to $150 at the time was already built in from investment firms buying and every retail trader was just getting conned into buying since it was a buzzword.  Turns out to be the worst financial decision I’ve made in my investing career and on top of that I was too stubborn to take my losses since my conviction was so high that it would come back down.  I thought everyone was getting fleeced but turns out it was me.  

I think if you happen to read news frequently, you are actually ahead of a lot of people despite what you think.  Kind of outsmarting yourself by thinking others are smarter.  I’ve also learned to never short a meme stock ever again."
03/25/2021,stocks,"“I like to go against the grain” 

That’s your problem right there. Don’t fight the trend. Yes the market has been on hard mode the past 6 weeks, but if you followed the trend of “puts on growth stocks” or “calls or xlf/xle” you would have banked. Being a contrarian is a fools game in the market 99% of the time."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The keyword is the moment. Those ETFs track the US and world market respectively. Assuming the economy won't crater to the abyss and never recover, sooner or later they'll bounce back and since they track the market, you don't gotta worry about picking the right stocks to make sure you benefit from the exchanges/indexes going up. 

Any day the market green, VTI is green and vice versa which makes it an investment you never gotta sweat over."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Did people forget that it's been 1 year since the crash from last year? People that bought everything up are taking profit now. I anticipate volatility for the next 2-3 weeks maybe even 4.

Most likely we will see rotation into sectors that were still down or had slight gain since last year."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Doesn't make any sense. Institutions should love all the dumb money entering the market, so instead of competing against other hedge funds that have teams of analysts with Phds in Maths from Harvard, they can compete against random new traders that have 10x less information and knowledge them them. 

Why would you want that 1% fee when you can take 100%?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Looks like if you short the market and cover your position same day your more likely to walk away with positive.

03/25/2021,stocks,"I agree. Lets not forget that the majority of the gains were probably on margin, which means it was leveraged money. All that is being pulled out and guess who's now holding the bag? All use folks who post on Reddit angry at the system. But we knew it was coming. I knew this was coming, I was just too hesitant to do the right thing back on March 1 and liquidate when it bounced back temproarily."

03/25/2021,stocks,"When I read your comment, [this article](https://prosperion.us/commentary/meet-bob-worlds-worst-market-timer/) came to mind. It's a piece about a hypothetical dude named Bob who always bought index funds at their height, only cashing out at retirement. If you're going to read the article, stop reading this comment right now. I highly recommend it; it was hugely eye-opening for me.

The conclusion (which I'll spoil to make a point) is that Bob ends up a millionaire in the end. Simply because he bought and held for a long period of time, and didn't cash out when things looked bad. Now, sure, index funds are one of the safest investments you can make, but the point is that even someone who would have bought in at literally the worst times, when the market was at its historical heights, still ended up making a decent return on his investment. Simply because the market always grows over time.

Time in the market beats timing the market, always and forever. As long as you don't invest in companies that eventually go bankrupt, you should be fine. And even then, if you're smart about managing risk, and don't invest more than you can afford to lose, even the occasional total loss should be fine."
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you assume 15% gains in 10 years when doing an average between previous investments and in between investments, that doesn't even beat inflation. Fortunately it's a lot higher than that but your example would convince me not to invest in stocks and just buy houses."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Only real short squeeze is GameStop.

Amc was lumped on there as a possibility.

And BB has been undervalued for years and still is.  But that was never truly a short squeeze candidate.

The issue with the whole rocket and silver thing was the pit of no where push from the media to divert attention away from GameStop.  Then after a day or two, they dropped back down after the hedges made a quick buck..."

03/25/2021,stocks,"Retirement without a larger generation below it will work similarly to the GME pum and dump.

03/25/2021,stocks,"It's likely a sell off from growth stock because of the yeild gains.
Pension funds like to keep bonds. But it was a money loser last year, while stocks soared. Now the stocks with the biggest profits get sold to get the stock to bond ratio back to where they want it."
03/25/2021,stocks,"W shaped recovery. I'm not in the US market, but I stopped buying last August through to the last month as I have had my suspicions about this for a while. My theory is this:

Many people have been at home a lot over the last year due to covid, often spending less if they can work from home or if their area is largely closed, which for some has lead to a little spare cash to invest. Many Western countries have young people locked out of their housing markets, many of those would be home buyers will be looking for alternative investments (and possibly have more time to research investments if they're stuck at home), and there has been a rise in apps like sharesies that allows them to put the (relatively, for investing) tiny amounts of money they would usually spend on takeaways etc into shares, the overall effect of which has pushed prices up. A lot of investments related to ""trendy"" things like veganism, environmental stuff, Tesla, and that kind of thing have all experienced quite a bit of growth from what I've seen, though I will admit that I haven't looked too far into it, which fits with this idea as people usually invest in what they know. 

Combine this with younger people having notoriusly short attention spans these days and often poor ability to delay gratification, as well as often not being super financially stable and needing to draw from those investments to cover expenses - especially if they've lost their jobs in the later waves of lockdowns - and it's inevitable that they will start selling off what they've brought. It's not like a panic sell, just large numbers of small investors getting bored or broke and gradually selling off what they brought last year. That's what I reckon we are seeing at the moment and will likely see for the next few months."
03/25/2021,stocks,What are the chances it's Gamestop?
03/25/2021,stocks,Do not question the bubble and do your part to inflate it.

03/25/2021,stocks,You say this as if it’s a ridiculous idea.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I remember someone in the related subreddits talking about a measurement called beta and how it basically is a measurement of a stocks correlation to the market overall, and relatively, gamestop is deep in the negative (so when market is up, gme is down, and vice versa) which according to their finance professor is pretty unheard of. Personally, I do have money on gme so I have been reading lots of posts, and it's pretty hard to deny that there is some heavy handed manipulation going on. Plus it makes sense that though retail investment has grown in recent years, the singular players with lots and lots of capital still have the potential to cause widespread change in the market. After all, they definitely don't put the bulk of their billions in just one stock. It's spread everywhere"
03/25/2021,stocks,"if you don't sell for loss, then you shouldn't sell for 5~10% profit. what you are doing is creating yourself a situation where you win small on some trades, but a large loss from a wrong trade wipe out all your gains"
03/25/2021,stocks,Do you sell your entire position when you’re up that 5-10% or a portion of it? I’m asking because I’m fairly new to individual investing and keep changing my strategy. I can’t find anything I’m comfortable with.
03/25/2021,stocks,Well I understand enough to continually have above average gains so there's that 😀 it's no conspiracy that Biden said he wouldn't get rid of guns and is now lobbying to get rid of guns. It's no conspiracy that Biden can barely put together a sentence. It's no conspiracy that Biden can't walk up some stairs without falling on his ass.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You should watch this too: https://youtu.be/AecvTErBQY8

I just wandered into this sub but there is basically no reason to pick stocks at all"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Indeed, quite frankly if you've done any research about the market as a whole you'll only find point after point showing that index funds are not only safer but provide higher returns than any other kind of investing. Here's a few off hand that I'm not gonna plop sources for just because I'm trying to get to work, maybe I'll add them later but you can also Google them if you're interested.

- something like 60% of existing actively managed funds have beat the market, sounds good right? But it has survivorship bias, active funds that did so badly they needed to close didnt make it into that statistic. If you take into account funds that failed it's more like 15%, hell with pure luck even 50% should beat the market.

- a study was done in Thailand and Brazil to try and find what percentage of day traders actively beat index investing for returns, they found in Thailand 1% of day traders beat the market, and in Brazil 0% did. The study in Brazil was done later than the study in thailand, so it's possible that further adoption of tech made it much more difficult for day traders to make money.

- there is a study that is updated yearly which tracks the best performing actively managed funds from the last 15 years, and tracks their performance over the next 15 years. They found that less than 5% of the funds continued to beat the market. This is evidence that their success was due to luck rather than skill.

- 40% of stocks have seen a drop from peak value of 70% and never recovered.

If your honest goal is to make money, not have fun playing in the market, the best way to go about it is invest in index funds that weight small cap and value stocks slightly heavier than a total market index fund to take advantage of factor index investing"
03/25/2021,stocks,"So, where else does the money come from when I take gains if not another entity's account? I know that at least most of the time my statement is truth."
03/25/2021,stocks,My fav headline: Stocks Turn Sharply Lower on Declining Sentiment
03/25/2021,stocks,The worst is the auto generated AI articles. They assign a headline to a stock move. No basis in reality.

I feel like I’ve done something right at least considering i’m down a total of 7% rather than these guys that are down 20-30% but it still sucks looking at just the past 3 months i’ve been doing this and how I was only positive or like the first 2 weeks lmao"

03/25/2021,stocks,I agree. I can burn my money way more efficiently than the feds and I’ll at least get some entertainment out of it.

03/25/2021,stocks,"No you haven’t, I guarantee you that no one that’s been investing for longer than that thinks GME is gonna moon like that. It’s obvious that you’re a stupid new investor that thinks this is a get rich quick scheme"

03/25/2021,stocks,"I have checked those out.   SENS for example, made just under $4M in revenue but had $100M in net losses in Q4,  their biggest loss so far.  They've lost money every year since 2016 and the bleeding increases annually. They're projecting 15 to 20M in revenue for 2021, but ultimately even more net losses. The company also has almost 5x as much debt as it does assets, meaning it has a negative book value.  In short it's kept alive by living off of loans with no profitability in sight.  Does that sound like a good investment to you?"
03/25/2021,stocks,Haha I understand the COVID hypothesis better than wtf is going on with Gamestop and how they've managed to tank the price to this point and not have it blast off yet. But it could be the double whammy of both! Which I wouldn't mind as much because I'm holding a few ;)
03/25/2021,stocks,"Wouldn't doubt it. I saw a similar pullback on all my stocks and the same interest rate fear mongering as well right before Gamestop spiked (for the first time). 

edit: added the stuff in parentheses"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm in Canada too. I think a complete crash is unlikely. The government can't and won't let that happen. They'll just do like they did in the States and print, then give more money at worst. I could see a big global shift/change happening in the near future though. China is unstoppable and they're doing whatever they want. The West have to properly band together (probably with other region as well) to properly stand up to and compete with China or who knows what will happen."
03/25/2021,stocks,"For the average trader/investor it is. Most funds don't even have that many, and they have multiple people managing them. If it works for you, go for it. But the more stocks you have to keep track of, the more difficult it is to keep track"

03/25/2021,stocks,That’s why I do my DD and invest in companies that in the long term will increase in value. Worst thing that can happen is that my money is locked up sometimes while I need to wait till the stock recovers till above my entry point. And I never invest a to big part of my portfolio in one company. So far this have worked well for me.
03/25/2021,stocks,Everyone thinks they’re the one who’s going to beat the odds and pick that 4%.
03/25/2021,stocks,"No. You’re oversimplifying a complex system. Think of it this way. If you sell your stock above the price you paid to entity2, then you “win.” But this transaction could also be a “win” for entity2. They could hold the stock for a certain amount of time and sell for an even higher price. In that case, did you not both win? Maybe they are holding to hedge another position so while they take a small loss on this position, the risk on their overall portfolio is more inline with their long term goals. Maybe the company issues more stock which dilutes the existing shares. Maybe the company buys back stock. Maybe the company goes bankrupt. Maybe the underlying business conditions change, and in the case of a highly illiquid position, the price doesn’t reflect this change. There’s a lot of situations that are more complex than “winning” or “losing” a trade. Everyone’s goals and timelines differ to some extent. There’s information asymmetry all over the place. There’s manipulation from whales. And so on and so forth."

03/25/2021,stocks,Falling knives...
03/25/2021,stocks,I started Feburary 16th and I fucking feel it.
03/25/2021,stocks,"If I've learned anything, it's that sometimes you just need to sit things out, and come back to it with a fresh perspective. It's often extremely difficult to see the whole picture when you're *in* the picture's frame."
03/25/2021,stocks,so like 75 bucks
03/25/2021,stocks,He said GM not GME
03/25/2021,stocks,"So you fly in here, a post unrelated to politics, to say dem economies trade sideways until a war starts. Then when asked for validity, you say 

“We’ll just because it hasn’t happened before doesn’t mean it won’t happen now!”

And you tell me that I’m the one who needs to divest all the emotion that connects identity to a political party.

Am I getting that right?"
03/25/2021,stocks,So do bad companies and bad business men. Weird...
03/25/2021,stocks,Projecting maybe?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Most people that even get a match, only get it to a certain limit. For me, it's 5%. For my wife, it's half match up to 6%. My previous company was up to 3%. If you are getting 50% match to full contribution, that's quite the deal. And most jobs don't come with a 401k at all. It's firmly a middle class thing."

03/25/2021,stocks,Wsb was never(recently during the first GameStop push)pushing silver or rocket.  That was a total ploy.

03/25/2021,stocks,🍌
03/25/2021,stocks,day trading gme is hurting the cause bro
03/25/2021,stocks,100k to 5.1M in less than a year and u haven't thought of liquidating everything and call it a lottery win
03/25/2021,stocks,"Wtf did you buy, gamestop?"
03/25/2021,stocks,The power of greed. Our monkey brain always wants more than it can afford to lose.
03/25/2021,stocks,Holy shit man! What a whirlwind. What did you do to reach 5M from 100k? And what caused the big drop down to 720k?
03/25/2021,stocks,"Well, you’ve done well. Jesus man. I made a killing last year on the crash, but lost a solid chunk of it staying bearish before I finally tapped out. It’s ok to tap out."
03/25/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/25/2021,stocks,"Holy shit, that’s some aggressive investing. What’s your strategies?  PM me."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Did you go all in and then sell your GME? I only ask because of the date you mentioned.   

Edit: I kept reading this thread.. My condolences."
03/25/2021,stocks,100k to 5.1m in a year is hella impressive. 100k to 720k is still impressive
03/25/2021,stocks,"Wtf were you invested in?
That's a big loss"
03/25/2021,stocks,Hoping you have money set aside for taxes?!?
03/25/2021,stocks,Cash out now
03/25/2021,stocks,"$5.1 mil = retirement for me, jeez"
03/25/2021,stocks,All about timing the market my friend but you’re a hell of a lot farther on then most of us so good on you.
03/25/2021,stocks,You started with $100K last month and that went to $5.1M? What exactly did you do?
03/25/2021,stocks,Holy mother Mary! What a rollercoaster ride
03/25/2021,stocks,Shittt JAN 28 should be a holiday.. shit was sweet then
03/25/2021,stocks,Ok teach me please
03/25/2021,stocks,"Please tell me you cashed at least a mil of that 5.1!!! like, for lambo sake!"
03/25/2021,stocks,"When will ya get back in? 

Who knows, maybe some of your cash could help turn things around :D (just give me a heads up on everything you buy ;)"
03/25/2021,stocks,were you mostly on options when you had that 5M?
03/25/2021,stocks,Hey all i'm hearing is $100k to $720k.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Probably not. I get your point about speculative stocks, and to some extent it can make sense when discussing things like EV stocks.

But SENS is different because it really only has 1 competitor, DexCom, and SENS has a vastly superior product. Once getting past all the regulation red-tape is done and distribution increases, this entire market goes to SENS."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Have you even read about recent partnerships and raised capital, or are you choosing to ignore that because it doesn’t fit your agenda?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Check the price spike in GME in January, it's the absolute inverse of the S&P.

GME has had negative beta for a while now which is super rare."
03/25/2021,stocks,"As a recent grad who just started working full time, I feel pretty much locked out of the housing market for the foreseeable future which is not a good feeling. As for China, not much can be done. They are on a collision course with the west. I am interested in the idea of Canzuk as it would probably help all countries involved, and may allow us to go to those countries in search of jobs and housing."
03/25/2021,stocks,This is why ETF's were invented.
03/25/2021,stocks,"If you been in the market for many years I am sure you got a good strategy if you are consistently profitable. I am a speculator not an investor, so I always have an exit strategy"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I appreciate your response. It's very informative. And I am relatively new to investing. Not to be contrarian or split hairs, but I would say that the zero sum thing still applies. It's just that a loss today could mean a bigger win later. Like when you average a security you hold while it's on a dip and you're confident that it will rally soon, you still lost that day, you don't win until you actually take profits . You still spent money that didn't result in profits at the closing bell of that day.  That is all I am getting at with that expression."
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm very close to selling off my whole portfolio (which isn't a lot but mostly bought last March)  and wait for it to level out
03/25/2021,stocks,Is it though?
03/25/2021,stocks,😅😅My bad Gentlemen
03/25/2021,stocks,No doubt. The great companies do it right. Costco is an example of a great company. Pays well. Good products. Treats customers well. That’s what we need more of.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I had those limited 401k matches before where I would get max like $3k per year. Now it's 50% uncapped: I put in $19.5k, get $9750 matched every year. Also mega backdoor Roth (no match there though)."
03/25/2021,stocks,"So DD that some random people posted on Reddit makes it fact? 

I just want you to understand that this isn’t how it works. There are so many unpredictable things going on. You can’t tell the future and anyone telling you they can is full of it."
03/25/2021,stocks,I love how you downvote all my comments 😂 have fun being a bag holder with dumbass dreams about GameStop being worth more than the GDP
03/25/2021,stocks,"Except the one day it got a megathread lol. But thats what im saying, even that came out of nowhere it seemed."
03/25/2021,stocks,The were people talking about RKT for months. You just didn't see them because you were focused on the GME threads
03/25/2021,stocks,Just bought 3k gme and limit order for amc 3 k at 10.  When I paperhanded gme at 209 I thought the game was done.  Think I will hold some long term.  Haven't really been day trading them.  Might sell half at 300.  Diamond hand or bag hold the rest...  Time will tell...
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah if you hate free moneys🤣
03/25/2021,stocks,"Remember the good old days of “1,000k is not a meme”? Yep, I feel stupid now."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The mindset that takes you from 100k to 5.1m isn’t gonna let you cash out. It’s gonna convince you that you’re the one who’s different and that if you can go from 100k->5M in a year, by year 2 you can to from 5M->100M, and so on"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm almost certain that the thing I love most about this entire saga so far. Is how I myself, have started questioning, wondering and eventually discovering  how very little I actually care for money. I've been seeing the same thing through so many others too. I've discovered how badly I've been blinded into always extrapolating my ACTUAL core/life values into a monetary amount my whole life. And greedily thinking that the more money I obtained, the more of my problems I could fix.

I've recently been trying to do things a different way around instead. So many concepts of my trading style have changed as a result. My research, dd and calculations have been leading me to companies contributing to innovation and my vision of a better future now, instead of plays casuing unnecessary anxiety. So far, I've no longer been fomo'ing. I have stopped prematurely adjusting a plan due to unexpected price drops or media  fear mongering.. 

Anyways sorry for the novel. Just wanted to offer yall a unique perspective on how everything happening has been positively affecting my life.. never thought I would reach this level of happiness and future outlook!"
03/25/2021,stocks,It's evidence he got lucky and doesn't really know what he's doing.
03/25/2021,stocks,Cue the scene from The Gambler with John Goodman. Perfect here. “If youre up 2.5million any asshole in the world knows what to do...”
03/25/2021,stocks,Must be options.. it’s amazing how quickly you can get margin called (nearly wiped me too)
03/25/2021,stocks,Yup
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yep. And we compares ourselves to the dozen lucky gamblers that post gain porn and assume we’ll get lucky just like them, and not unlucky like all the loss porn posters. Sigh..."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Tesla, forbidden ticket, clean energy, Corsair, genetics. Didn’t sell at the top. Played some SPACs and spy the last month while losing in this kangaroo market and finally went all cash. I’d rather make $20k a day scalping options. I’m not comfortable holding anything overnight anymore."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thanks man. I remember thinking that I've never been so sad about making money. It sucks, but just like college, we all end up paying tuition. I'm just tired or writing those checks, so I cashed out for now. The momentum was against my positions, and I saw the writing on the wall and accepted my loss. Buying short term puts for now to ease the pain on the way down."
03/25/2021,stocks,Holy mother of god. How is that even possible?!!
03/25/2021,stocks,">Wow thats crazy man. I was $10.6M last may and now down to about 73k. The market man

This has to be a joke right"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Damn... wow... well, I feel less bad now about my own lost gains."
03/25/2021,stocks,Go all in when I have conviction. I just got lucky holding Tesla before last March (bag holding $100k of Tesla since 2013). Then I threw $370k at game stop in early January. Rode that wave up and forgot to sell in late January. Sigh...
03/25/2021,stocks,"Haha don’t feel too bad. I still 7x’d my money using a combination of luck and no risk management in one year. Risk management would’ve saved me the headache of not securing at least $4.5M in game stop winnings. But then again, risk management would’ve prevented me from impulse investing 100% of my life savings in GME on the day of the pop (January 14th I think)."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Impressively lucky*

Want to hear how un-impressive my investment strategy was prior? $100k in Tesla in 2013. Ignored it for 7 straight years while it traded sideways. Then I sold in March 2020 for 150% return, instead of holding for a 2800% return when it peaked at $900/share (would’ve been $2.8M)."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Forbidden Ticker. Tesla. Corsair CRISPR genetics. ICLN. SPY Puts. Lyft Calls. Dash puts. There's money to be made in the middle. $100k to $720k in 12 months isn't too bad, even if there was a lot of noise in the middle. Could've been $5M, but few people time anything right. Live and learn and keep the spirit up. Last time I checked, nobody should shed tears for making 6x their annual salary in 12 months of pushing buttons on my iphone. I'll take the win, even though it kinda feels like a loss."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yep. Tax bill is about $200k for 2021. $50k for 2020. Sitting on $720k now.
03/25/2021,stocks,Done. Sitting on $720k cash now. I only play small plays intraday and cash out quick. No more 100% all in like I used to back in the bull market days.
03/25/2021,stocks,I'm waiting for early - mid April to see if the stimulus/infrastructure funding leads to bull market round 2.
03/25/2021,stocks,Literally only shares
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ok.  Yeah i had actually looked at dexcom like a month ago not realizing it was competitor, but i didn't buy because i thought it was too expensive.  If senseonics overtakes dxcm, then yeah i could see your point.  But i just did a google search and it looks like dexcom has a new device coming out and there are a couple other players in the continuous glucose monitoring game."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I don't know what else to tell you.  I'm an accountant.  I look at results and projections.  Neither of those look good to me and in my experience when a stock has run up a ton, it doesn't take much to drop it down. I have no position in this stock and my only agenda here is to talk about fundamentals.  It looks to me like it would take a truly herculean effort for this company to turn around.  I only buy when a company has been profitable and growing for a while  with expected continued growth, low debt, high ROE, and reasonable valuation ratios. SENS has none of that."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I'm American and had to google Canzuk. Can... can we join please? We will be on our best behavior, promise!"
03/25/2021,stocks,"This was more my sarcasm, like yes dude I own etfs. But my portfolio in general used to move with the market and now its strangely decoupled"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m disagree that’s stocks are fundamentally a zero sum game. That’s the equivalent of saying that trading assets of value is zero sum. It’s not because there’s not a constant definition between winning and losing between the two parties. Plus additional complexities. 

On the other hand, option contracts, because they have a clearly defined expiration, essentially trade in a zero sum game."
03/25/2021,stocks,Agreed. We all need to pitch in for the common good so we can all benefit from the rewards. I love Costco.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You can't change their minds, these people believe there's no way they could possibly lose because big fund managers are stupid and really really want to make WSB lose for some reason. As the old saying goes, ""this literally cannot go tits up""."
03/25/2021,stocks,Mhm mhm
03/25/2021,stocks,Sounds good to me 😍
03/25/2021,stocks,That was shortly after the entire mod team was ninja banned and new mods were put in place.  There’s been an insane amount of bs going on with dirty tactics and the likes from then and still now.
03/25/2021,stocks,"You don’t understand the circumstances.  Every stock was talked about on wsb and other subs for months.

But when the whole rocket push and silver push hit, literally no one had talked about them for several months.  But the media flood headlines like it was the next hot thing wsb was jumping to."
03/25/2021,stocks,Selling is helping shorts
03/25/2021,stocks,You giving them shares to cover with. I'm not looking to make pocket change.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It burns the most when 1k actually would have been feasible until RH turned the lights off. That scenario has never been encountered before, so a lot of people were left guessing what's happen next.. and ended up losing the shirts on their back."
03/25/2021,stocks,Stupid is better than suicidal.
03/25/2021,stocks,whats that supposed to mean lmao
03/25/2021,stocks,Jesus good job on the massive return still. Yeah I’m starting to think day trading is the way to go in this shit market right now. I get anxiety every day looking at my portfolio.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Easy, just type it, maybe someone will believe you."
03/25/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/25/2021,stocks,I sold thousands of Bitcoin for $200 each so I know the pain
03/25/2021,stocks, Numbers are only one part of a DD. There’s your flaw.
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's a good idea! Right? I'd be all for some of you guys joining lol, but I think the idea is to set up something that will allow us to compete with the likes of the US, China, and the EU now that Brexit has happened. I'm most excited about the possibility of free movement. I'd love to go down to Aus or to the Uk."
03/25/2021,stocks,The valuation of a lot of the best holdings seemed to make less and less sense and also with rate uncertainty I wasn’t sure the more speculative holdings were gonna take off in the short term. It’s never a bad thing to take profits (specially if they’re like 150%+) and move that money to something safer that has a saner valuation or An ETF like SPY.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yea I agree I can’t convince most here but the point is for someone else who’s on the fence to maybe think twice about these things. Skepticism is a healthy approach to these things and if I can get one person to be a little more skeptical I think it’s a success.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I do understand the circumstances. People were talking about RKT. I know because I was researching it just before it spiked and most of the threads on Reddit discussing it were on WSB. Even just a few days before. I know WSB likes to pretend everything is a conspiracy against them, but it's just not the case"
2021-03-24 23:34:35,stocks,"Advice on FDA approval stocks So for starters I am  MAJORLY bullish on SENS. As many of you know they are awaiting FDA approval in a few months.  I was thinking about loading up and waiting for fda approval and then the share price will increase like quadruple or so lol.

Now my question and or thoughts are... normally when I see a freshly fda approved news on a certain stock come out and I look at the stock to see if its too late to jump aboard. I'm allways too late, By the time I look up the stock the price is already maxed out and seems to be working its way back down to earth. 

Is this normal and to be expected? The reason I'm curious is. Since I am bullish long term on sens I'm curious as to if it would be smart to load up until fda approval. Then cash out once it's approved. Wait a couple weeks for it to come down then reenter for long term. 

Or once fda approval will SENS most likely keep going up once fda approved. I'm trying to form a game plan for when it happens. It seems like a matter of when SENS goes to the moon.. not if..  and with all of the red this market is seeing. SENS seems to be holding its ground compared to alot of other big boy stocks. Which makes me want to buy more.. anyways what are your thoughts?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"This might be a start: Derek Lowe has a blog called *in the pipeline ""  early March he put up a post about FDA approvals and linked to a paper that listed all of them for quite a few years. You can take that list and find companies that were a similar size as yours and look at the stock price history for when they were approved."
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah ill give that a shot. Who is Derek lowe?
03/25/2021,stocks,Medical researcher who also blogs about Medical research. He tries to make it readable and does a fairly good job of explaining things in a way that i can understand despite being completely ignorant of anything medical .  Although the people who comment there go way over my head with medical terminology i don't usually understand.   Makes me believe that Derek knows what he's talking about when those are the type of people commenting.
03/25/2021,stocks,Thanks I'll check him out!
2021-03-24 23:25:50,stocks,"Was PLUG power already sued? Will I get money from my holding loss. Do I need to take action? Hey guys, slightly newer investor here. I’m really confused and at a 4K loss since January on about 150 shares of plug. 

I’m lost on if the company has already been sued, or if that’s still coming and how it’ll impact the stock. 

I’m also lost on if I actually need to join all these annoying class action announcements regarding the case to get some loss recovered. 

Dose anyone has experience or knowledge for this? I’m very worried and not sure what to expect coming up or know if I should just sell and buy after the case closes."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Last I saw, many law firms were trying to first get a “Lead Plaintiff” - which from my super limited knowledge means they’re looking for a perfect example of someone to represent.

From one random law firm:

Interested Plug Power investors have until May 7, 2021 to retain counsel and apply to be a lead plaintiff if they are interested to do so. Investors do not need to be a lead plaintiff in order to be a class member. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other investor class members in managing the class action."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Out of all the companies big enough to be in the Russell 3000, how many have accounting issues each year?  Right,  none.  Generally one scam every three years or so."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's well known that public accountants don't catch all errors. Some errors aren't significant enough to require a restatement either. Generally speaking the more money a company has, the more ""creative"" they can be when it comes to accounting. Meaning they'll use loopholes in the law to set up various constructions so they pay as little tax as possible. There's a lot of theory on audits, precisely because it can be really complex and some companies put a lot effort in covering up errors. Errors can be unintentional too if adminstrative processes are subpar or employees aren't trained well enough. A large part of the audit process is just sampling random invoices and journal entries and stuff, so that obviously doesn't cover everything. Accountants know the rules but they can't possibly audit every single thing that a company does

Extremely high growth in a company can also add complexity because the administrative organization can often not scale up as fast as the rest of the company. That's why public accountants become increasingly critical of business process management as the company becomes larger.

Again you're making bold statements based on your own assumptions of how accounting works and what you've read on the internet or heard from people."
2021-03-24 23:24:34,stocks,"DraftKings Sportsbook (DKNG) 
Only 25 out of the 50 states have legalized sports betting with several set to legalize this year. For all the apes out there who are heavy in weedstonks. 27 out of 50 States have decriminalized and 16 states have legalized weed to put this into perspective. 

DraftKings is current trading at under 70, and has a price target of 87. They had a 25%-30% annual growth in 2020 despite most sports being shut down and or limited in a large capacity. With major sports returning to a sense of normality in the coming months I believe the 87 price target is relatively low. Adding in all of their partnerships they’ve made in the past few months, some being exclusive and some not. Their target total revenue for 2021 is 1 Billion Dollars. 

In 2021 so far, Michigan launched online sports betting. As well as Virginia. Partnership with the NFL expanded to Canada. The all knowing Cathie Wood purchased half a million shares. Dish Network announced a strategic agreement where the Sportsbook could potentially be accessible for the degenerate dad sitting on the couch who doesn’t know how to work his phone and operate the app. 

I am relatively new to investing, but I know a smart play when I see it. 

Similar things could be stated for FanFuel, operated by Flutter Entertainment (PDYPY) or Penn National Gaming (Penn). But I like DraftKings over both of them. 

Like I said I am relatively new to this, so any input for or against my opinion is appreciated."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It's such a long play. 1.15 billion in new convertable bonds due in 2028.

Im already in. Might as well hold and buy the dips when they are deep."
03/25/2021,stocks,Elys.
03/25/2021,stocks,"i love it. kinda mad that it dipped 2 dollars more after i bought at 68, but whatever.. i gots more money"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Another company that benefits greatly of the loosening legislature of U.S. online gambling is Evolution gaming (EVO.ST). A swedish B2B online live casino game provider that's been flying under the radar. If you're looking for something interesting, you might want to do some research on that."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Also, earnings looked solid for last quarter. Imagine the next quarter with the Mcgregor fight, Super Bowl and March Madness. Plus the UFC deal and the HEAVY advertising on their part. I don’t know shit about business but next quarter is looking pretty good, right?"
03/25/2021,stocks,You forget that no one chooses FanDuel over DK
03/25/2021,stocks,I hear ya. Pretty much everything in the market is red right now.. analysts still have price target of 87 on the low end though.

2021-03-24 23:15:18,stocks,"Rate my current Roth IRA dividend portfolio? Rate my current dividend portfolios holdings?

I am 23 and just started my Roth IRA in February and so far have a little over $4,300 deposited (still using 2020 as the deposit year don’t worry)     I am also focused on dividend growth investing as I view it as the safest option I’m willing to do and since it’s my retirement account I do want some safety in it. I also don’t want to just toss it into an index fund as I personally believe I’ll be able to pick the best stocks from each sector (or at least the top 25% in each sector) and outperform the general market as a whole. I also enjoy doing research on companies as it lets me stay up to date on what is driving our society from the business perspective and juxtapose that to my personal perspective. I also have a ton of time to listen to ER’s and read reports done by third parties as I’m often driving long distances for either work or to see friends. There isn’t a day that I’m not looking into at least one of my holdings or potential holdings. I enjoy it and that’s why I’m not doing an ETF (I also do have some ETF’s again just for safety’s sake). My portfolio by sector:

Communication services: VOD, DTEGY. (Going to be adding DIS and either T or VZ)

Consumer Discretionary: NKE, HBI. (Going to be adding MCD, and YUM)

Consumer Staple: MO, KO, PEP. (Going to be adding WMT, BTI, PG, and either COST or TGT)

Energy: KMI, OKE (going to be looking to add either CVX or XOM depending which is doing more for green energy, same for picking between RDS and BP)

Financials: AFL, C. (Need to do more research into this sector tbh, any suggestions would be welcome)

Health Care: ABBV. (Going to be adding MDP, JNJ, LLY, and either MRK or MRNA)

Industrials: EMR. (Going to be adding UNP, MMM, and maybe WM, then either RTX or LMT)

Materials: NUE, STLD. (Going to be adding APD. Would love to hear some other suggestions for me to look into)

Real Estate: O, STAG. (Looking at maybe adding one or two more REITS, open to suggestions)

Tech: IBM. (Going to add AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL, maybe AMD.  Would love to hear what your tech dividend payers are)

Utilities: VST, AQN. (Going to be adding PEG, NEE, and would love to find maybe one or two more)

I also hold a few ETF’s:

SPYD, ARKK, MSOS, and THCX."
03/25/2021,stocks,"First I’m going to say is just ignore anyone who is saying you shouldn’t be looking at dividend stocks and go all in on growth tech or whatever. Remember that at the end of the day YOU HAVE TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE RISK YOU ARE TAKING. Otherwise the stress will eat you up. 

So since this is a Roth, yes dividend stocks is better here compared to a brokerage. So if you want heavy dividends then you want to forego some of that sector allocations. Consumer discretionary and tech have such low yield and growth potential that you might want to focus on the higher paying sectors 
Utilities
Communication 
Staple

Alternatively you can also just do 
XLU XLC XLP to enhance what you already got there."

03/25/2021,stocks,"MSFT and AAPL have dividends to be included in certain funds. There’s nothing wrong with buying either (except for their high PE) but the div yield shouldn’t be your main driver. 

IBM is a dinosaur whose price has gone nowhere in the last 10 years. You would have made more money buying SPY over IBM."

Not my fault people hate different investment strategies. And it’s not hard to see that this sub got swamped off of WSB hype. I posted this post to several different subs, mostly ones focused on dividend growth or long term investing and the responses are light years ahead of what y’all mostly be saying. I mean holy  fuck, someone says dividends or long term holdings and y’all come with pitchforks despite only starting investing in January who’s only read shit on WSB and now think they know everything because they made a little money. I’ve been investing for over 5 years personally (3 passive using mutual funds and ETF’s that made me minimal returns and wasn’t doing what I wanted it to do) I switched to actively managing my RobinHood account and turned it into a growth account that’s done well enough that I decided it’s time to start planning for retirement. What I’m doing isn’t unheard of or crazy or impractical, not my fault it’s to much work for you to do. Maybe I’m just better 🤷‍♂️"

03/25/2021,stocks,"I’m not asking for people to tell me my investment style is wrong, I’m asking for people thoughts on the individual holdings in my portfolio and asking for other suggestions. Read next time.

And as for growth beating dividends, it just doesn’t, the historical data is pretty clear, unless I’m able to perfectly time the bottom of one of the top 5 performing growth stocks I’ll make more money in a solid dividend payer like KO or another dividend king.

I’ll also have to be able to predict which stock will become the next big thing. Or I can buy WMT and cash in on them expanding their banking to eventually capture the large amount of people in the US who are bank less."

They are restricted shares being sold by insiders.

The cash that you will pay for them won't go to the company, it will go to the insider shareholders.

So they will increase the supply of shares in the market without increasing shareholder equity for existing public shareholders. That's a dilution that devalues the existing shares.

If TSLA is very undervalued as per Ark, why would they need to convince other people to pump up the price and not just buy more at this current level.

It's good that they are changing things up. New CEO. New fab investments. etc. But they have been struggling with manufacturing the newest and smallest chips that they have had planned for years, and I think their woe's are not over.

The competitor will take substantial marketshare during 2021 2022 and probably 2023. Not until then will we see if Intel has managed to turn around their company. The road towards that will be filled with quarterly earnings reports laden with sinking revenue, sinking profits per sold unit and sinking marketshare."

The U.S. is taking a very aggressive tone against China. I don't want to go into the reasons for this or whether these sanctions were rightly imposed. **China has now proclaimed the economic goal of no longer being the manufacturer for the rest of the world, but to make itself more independent of the West.**

The CCP does not let something like this sit on its hands and **usually reacts with exaggerated severity.** Do we have to fear that relations between China and the West will deteriorate sharply? What would that mean for companies that produce in China or need China as a large sales market? You can't be sure how the relationship between the West and China will develop, but do you think the effect would be strongly felt?  **Apple, Tesla, Disney, to name just a few prominent examples, and many more rely on profits from China. Would you therefore be concerned and more cautious with such stocks?**"

New manufacturing place? Maybe India since it's an important ally in Asia (since their also anti China) or maybe Africa to prevent Chinese influence from spreading. There's also all of Latin America since it's close by. 

China would probably ban some American companies & vise versa. 

With manufacturing being moved to other, probably poorer, countries it would create better economic opportunities for citizens living in those countries & with more affluent citizens it would create a new market for these companies. 

In the short term that could be a problem but in the long run companies I think they'd switch their strategies & adapt. 

It'd probably be best if we did move away from China as the global manufacturer & instead manufacture to an ally instead so as to not be dependent on a potential threat to the U.S."

Second, people seem to think they stocks are going to disappear and they will lose all their money if they get delisted. Not true, you will still get your money somehow (but of course if that happens, the stock would have tanked very much at that time).

Asians are treated well overall outside of a few publicized cases since hate crimes are excedingly rare, i would know since i am asian myself. Most of the few anti-asian sentiments started way before the media was as against china.

V has a 0.1 ER and F has a 0.08 ER.

I took a few swing positions in 5 of my favorite stocks (all growth stocks) about 10 days ago. Originally I had planned for 2-3 day swing trade. All these companies were trading at a great discount from all time highs after the market wide sell off a few weeks back. I bought in during the rally and of course it was right before the bond yield scare and current chaos plunged the NASDAQ. My entire account is tied up in these trades and I guess I could’ve managed my dollar cost averaging better but I just didn’t foresee a major market correction, especially since the market had just finished selling off a good chunk. 

I’m leaning towards holding out. Since all of my stocks have reached oversold on the RSI (of course that doesn’t mean they can’t continue to sell off) but unless we’re heading for a serious market correction it just wouldn’t make sense to cash out and buy back in. 

Of course no one can predict the markets but I would like to figure out what the consensus is regarding general investor/trader sentiment around the market right now. Do you foresee a significant market correction? If not, why not?"

It’s absolutely outrageous that I’m about to lose all my money on a god damn wrestling stock but here we are...

1:  NFT plays have been going absolutely parabolic.  With the decades of original content the WWE has there is no way they won’t capitalize on this and create their own version of NBA top shot.  It’s only a matter of time and I expect them to strike sooner rather than later.

2:  if you don’t like it as an NFT play it is a reopening play.  Wrestlemania, their largest event of the year takes place in 3 weeks  at Raymond James stadium and they have already stated they are hoping to have the largest attendance for a US event since the pandemic began.  

3.  We got a 20% short float and tons of money coming in from a billion dollar tv deal with Fox and the recent news that peacock purchased the rights to the WWE network.

2021-03-24 20:23:21,stocks,"Broker Research Hello Everyone! First post on this sub, but I have learned a lot and wanted to share some research. Sorry ahead of time if I used the wrong flair just let me know!

Anyways, I started investing in 2017 on Robinhood. I like many others have been understandably upset with recent events surrounding the brokerage. After doing some research and reading through a lot of threads I never came up with a good alternative. I opened a Fidelity account as was suggested by many people; however, as someone who's only ever used RH I found their interface to be confusing and outdated. I tried to use the Spire app, but it would never let me log in. I kept looking, Webull seemed like a logical option since its interface is similar to that of RH. The issue with Webull is its financial position is similar to that of RH and would/has restricted trading. Then I logged into my Ally bank account to check on some deposits and noticed they have self-directed trading accounts among their options. After doing some research I decided to open an account and test it out and let me tell you I am happy I did. I've used ally for my banking needs for a little over a year now and never had any issues. 

Do your own research, but as someone who's been wondering where to go after RH this is it. I can access all my accounts from one App. The app is easy to use and actually works. The website is also easy to use gives you the data you need and access to the advanced data and graphs if you want that too. You can app for margins and options trading, and they charge competitive rates for both. If anyone has questions I will be happy to help how I can. Like I said I plan to move my RH over to Ally when I can!"
2021-03-24 20:00:47,stocks,"Change My Mind - $MSFT is a better growth play that $AAPL If I'm investing for retirement, let's say 40 years out, I'm betting on Microsoft more than Apple.

Microsoft has a monopoly over the business world and has a subscription-based business model with products that are timeless (Word, Excel, PowerPoint). Documents, spreadsheets, and presentations have been used for centuries if not millenniums and we will continue to use these methods of communication for centuries more. PLUS the shift to cloud is driving demand for their cloud offering Azure (50% growth in one year). It's intelligent cloud segment revenues grew 23%+ a year and quickly gaining market share. Ever since they pivoted to SaaS, their revenue and earnings have been stable and increasing so consistently - it's beautiful. Businesses will always choose Microsoft!

Apple relies more heavily on consumer products and its total revenue and earnings haven't grown that much since 2015. What’s next after the iPhone? Car? Glasses? We're betting on them innovating in a massive way. But can they replicate the vision and innovation of Steve Jobs? Many men and women have tried... Only person doing it right now is Elon Musk. But that's besides the point.

Check this out - financials support Microsoft as a better growth company than Apple.

2015 to 2020 Revenue (June 2015 to Present): 
$MSFT - $93.6B to $153B (+64.5% - $59.4B growth) $AAPL - $233.7 to $294B (+25.8% - $60.3B growth)

2015 to 2020 EBITDA (June 2015 to Present): 
$MSFT - $33.6B to $71.7B (+113% - $38.1B growth) $AAPL - $77.9B to $85.1B (+9.2% - $10.5B growth)

2015 to 2020 Operating Profit Margin (June 2015 to Present): 
$MSFT - 19.4% to 33.4% (+72%)
$AAPL - 30.2% to 21.7% (-28%)

Microsoft is a cash cow and sales and profits are increasing at double digit rates. Apple is even more of a cash cow but sales and profits are slowing. Microsoft has a new core offering (Azure). Apple does not (yet). Numbers don't lie. Microsoft is a better growth play than Apple."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Lol...I bought $MSFT in 2016 when they traded at $56 I remember reading some ""experts"" who said that Micrsft missed the mobile phone market and how consumers were turning from PC to mobile/tablets....and now Microsoft is a growth stock lol....point I would not count out companies that sit on billions in cash they can afford huge R&D depts and buy up start up competitors. AAPL M1 chip and their dedication to top down system optimization would make them interesting in the EV space"
03/25/2021,stocks,I won't change because I agree with you. Apple only relies on stagnating sales of iPhone. They've got tons of cash but don't know what to do with it

https://ibb.co/RQXtrbg

Govt still fucking loves Microsoft though for some reason, so Windows and Microsoft tooling is still everywhere... Oh well. Eventually it will fall. God I hate Microsoft."
03/25/2021,stocks,"1. Azure is growing faster than AWS
2.  Windows will just certainly be there corporate platform of choice for a long time.  
3. Windows has WSL2 now which let's you run Linux almost seamlessly. I use it for my Linux deployments.
4. MS doesn't really care what you use now, as long as it's in Azure.  They own Typescript.  They own VS Code.  All things specifically meant for Web Development.
5. Most large scale SW Dev is NOT Java.  It's definitely still the most widely used (mostly due to Android), but has been losing popularity very fast.  I've interviewed with 30+ companies over the last few years.  I can only think of 2 that were Java.  While that's anecdotal...i just don't see it as much now.
6.  I run Docker in Azure.  They are a bit behind AWS, but are aren't too far off.  They are mainly about Liber eyes, which I do not use.  Visual Studio also makes it extremely easy to create and deploy Docker images.  I also run a stack in AWS, which is also very good.
7. I'm not sure what you are referring to with the 'licensing at scale' comment.  Running webservers in Windows will cost you about 20-25% more for the same hardware than Linux.  You get some pros, some cons with that cost.  I don't think MS cares what you use as long as it's in Azure.  They run Linux themselves.

8.  I use VS Code for just about everything now.  Tests are still better in VS, though.  VS Code is open source.  .NET is open source. 

9. I see MS stuff being used more now.  Teams, VS Code, .NET.  Dunno, i disagree."
03/25/2021,stocks,Excellent take.  I don't understand the down-votes.  You make very good points u/wirebeads!
03/25/2021,stocks,"This is no longer 2010. It’s not just hot start ups that are doing open source. There are fortune 500 established companies that are actively developing and maintaining software that runs on open source component architectures.

I could totally see the argument for early adopter developers jumping on the open source bandwagon. That just isn’t the case anymore. 

Open source has achieved critical scale at this point. It’s no longer an early adopter trend.  Open source architectural components have long ago been adopted in the Enterprise space.  

There are just so many tools and uses in the open source ecosystem.  Tools for massive data processing, machine learning, AI and cloud computing that is really in demand in the enterprise space.

I think your argument was valid in 2010 but I don’t think it stands today.

As far as acquisition of github, I’m sure it plays a part in future licensing for version control.  Remember that git is an open source version control system vastly superior to VSS or anything MS has.  Also to use git you do not need to signup on github. You can self host your own repo.  Why would I want to pay Microsoft for github hosting when I could self host for free?  Again, open source wins. The big legacy software vendors are just trying to buy up a developer space that was created using open source tools.  This is because they think that owning the space well give them developer mindshare and they’ll be able to play the license money trap game in the long run.  

It won’t and they won’t. 

It’s just not going to happen."
03/25/2021,stocks,"It does help tremendously being having the solider in the trenches perspective.  I made a fortune in GOOG because I invested early.  The search engines at the time were really terrible.  Altavista, yahoo search, Lycos...  I used google for technical web queries and it was a game changer.  So I bought early and held on to it.

With Apple, I saw how much better iPhones were than Blackberries and PalmOne Treos which were in use (for business) at the time.  I bought as much AAPL as I could afford at the time when I saw the iPhone.  Just a screen and no buttons.  Game changer.  All my co-workers were moving over to iPhones.

Sometimes it is really advantageous to your portfolio to have the man on the ground view of the tech industry.  Products that excite you and your co-workers have a way of turning the companies that make them massively profitable in the long run."
03/25/2021,stocks,"u/IAMHideoKojimaAMA, you really have to just use the products.

MSFT's OS is always a new face on an existing crappy underlying foundation.  I looked in C:\\Windows\\System and found exes in there from the Windows 3.1 days.  In July 1981 Microsoft bought all rights to 86-DOS, otherwise known as QDOS, for Quick and Dirty Operating System, from Seattle Computer Products for $50,000 or $75,000.  They got a buggy, crappy operating system that they've continually upgraded up to this point.  But the internals are still the same buggy, crappy, barely functional foundation that was made to work just in the nick of time.  Also the heterogeneous hardware support gives you all sorts of unpredictable software behavior since there could be existing third party driver bugs introduced in OS operation making Windows an unpredictable nightmare to run.

AAPL's OSX was based on OPENSTEP NexTSTEP 10 years of operating system design.  Solid foundation.   Restricted hardware.  Predictability.   OS functions per spec and does what it's supposed to do.

Gun to my head, AAPL any day over MSFT.  Not just as a stock.  As an every day workstation / computer for use."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I gotta be honest. You're coming off as both arrogant and delusional with your open source preaching. It's one thing to make a prediction but a totally different thing to guarantee it.

What makes your argument completely off the mark is that it's based on the 2010 version of Microsoft. In fact if you made this comment back then, I would've agreed with many of your points. MS really was at a risk of turning out like IBM. However you've completely ignored their transformation since Satya took over. Some of the key changes he made since then are getting rid of the bloat in the company, adopt open source and linux, and move away from a reliance on windows.

MS themselves have heavily adopted open source tooling and added Linux support for many of their products. The fact that you keep talking about the two as separate tells me you haven't really been following the company much in the last five years and seems to mostly based on an older version of the company.

Of course no one's forcing you to invest in the company, but anyone who has done so since Satya took over has enjoyed  a 500% plus rate if return.

Edit: and your entire analysis is based on their development tooling, which isn't even close to being their biggest cash cow. You've completely ignored their growth in Azure and the potential they have for gaming with Game Pass and xCloud. I give this DD 2/10"

Just sharing my experience. The market is determined by how people react to things, not the events themselves. A security will perform well in the market not because it's a good company with a good business model, but because investors/traders believe that it is a good company and buy the stock. That's important to remember.

I got my start in 1999, months before the massive tech crash.  I literally lost all my money on investments in companies that went out of business.  But I kept at it, so don't get discouraged just because you jump in at a time when the market is correcting."

03/25/2021,stocks,Probably because they've made money on their stock picks. Lol. 🙋‍♀️🖐️ Ignore the upselling and PAY ATTENTION to the important stuff and you'll see why they are a decent service.
03/25/2021,stocks,"I've always looked at things like ""what can I gain from this even if part of it is annoying"". I absolutely hate all the upselling of TMF. It's tacky and clearly drives surface dwellers away. I CHOSE to ignore all that and ONLY pay attention to their recommendations (mostly on Stock Advisor service). I am a busy parent and business owner, and don't have droves of time to do a bunch of research myself. Their services help people like me. They've helped me bring my play account from 8,900 to 45,000. Granted PART of it was the good 2020 market, but still... I'm a very happy TMF customer since 2017 (I've paid attention to them since the late 90s). Just ignore the upselling. It's easy to do when your stocks from them are doing good."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Yes. 

Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely is fun and accessible. 

The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis tells the story of the founding of heuristics. 

A Random Walk Down Wall Street and A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market cover the topic, but it's not the main focus. The inverse is Nudge by Richard Thaler which dives deep into heuristics but not so much the market.

Nassim Taleb also touches on the subject to varying degrees across his work.

Say someone makes a detailed post about TSLA and uses sources from X site--they could be paid to refer to X site.  Then either the OP or other paid people could make comments on the page so it gets more traffic, leading more people to click to X site.  The comments can be positive or inflammatory, the point being more discussion."

03/25/2021,stocks,"It's easy to spot the people who have never used their service.

I had no clue who TTD was prior to purchasing. Never heard of them. Cost me $1,323 total, now worth $10,020.  TTD up 657%
TDOC up 426%, ZM up 193%, APPN up 96%, CRWD up 84%... You get where I'm going. I have 21 stocks in my ""play portfolio,"" 16 are from TMF SA and 3 from TMF RB and 2 from Reddit reading (those are not doing good lol)> I'm sticking with TMF.

03/25/2021,stocks,"who? mf? no idea! I said i dont read any of their drivel. I made a bot crawling most financial news sites to add tickets (like aapl, msft, ...) to a spread sheet so I dont have to discover new companies to screen and to update when something is being talked about. And then there is another bot to screen those companies, pulling their financial data or updating it. and then there is another bot screening it for certain triggers or interesting things. And if bot number 3 finds something he texts me and i look at it."
03/25/2021,stocks,">Huh.  You'd think a place purporting to give (and asking you to buy) financial advice would be able to spot a broad market trend.

That's a reasonable point, but they explicitly say they recommend stocks with the intent to hold three to five years, making shorter term market trends less relevant to their overall thesis.

Was buying in early 2021 a poor entry point? Yes. But the poor entry point becomes less relevant over a 3 to 5 year time frame."
03/25/2021,stocks,"First one is obvious, do I agree with the assessment and do I like the company.  Seems trivial, but I had signed up for RB like 10 years ago and had it for a year.  I bought every recommendation they made and to be honest, it didn't go well so I cancelled my subscription.  


The second thing, I won't buy a stock that's over $40/share unless i REEEEEEEALLY like the stock.  An example of this would be ROKU.  I bought it at $60.  So why $40?  Good question.  I took all of their recommendations over a 5 year window and looked at the returns based on their share price at recommendation.  In that window there were 18 stocks they recommended that were under $40.  None of them had a negative return.  14 had over a 100% return.  7 were over 300% return.  The average return for all 18 stocks was 291%.   I didn't calculate the return the stocks over $40, but didn't really have to.  A good percentage (30%-ish) were negative.  There were a couple that were over 100% return, but not many, and those that were started in the $50-60 range.    


So if you think about it there were around 120 or so stocks that they would recommend in a 5 year window, and with my 2 additional screens I would have narrowed that down to a maximum of 18 picks.  There was a stretch, I think maybe last year, where they went 9 months or something without recommending a stock below $40, so I just sat patiently and waited."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Legitimate question on him: what picks has he made, or what has he done in general, outside of GME that would make him trustworthy?

You can find a lot of people out there who made a really smart investment one time. That doesn't necessarily mean you should listen to them going forward. There is a big difference between a one-hit wonder and a consistent winner

So if you have good reason to listen to DeepFuckingValue beyond his activity around GME, go ahead by all means. Otherwise I would be cautious"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Not true.  And here's everyone's favorite site to prove it:

03/25/2021,stocks,"I have all of their services. Built up to their One Service over time. It’s a lot to pay, but I’ve profited far more than the annual fee. Hence, their solicitation of live feedback on Zoom. 20 years ago I would think it’s nuts to pay $1000’s, but I used profits from their service to pay for it. No regrets either. I will undoubtedly pay the the renewal fee when the time comes. I’m 50 years old and have a decent amount of investable dollars. But the ads- unbelievably horrendous."
03/25/2021,stocks,agree the ads are a poor representation of their services. The service is as good as the ads are bad if that makes sense. I have not been shy with them about their horrendous and embarrassing marketing. I've quit counting how many times over the membership has paid for itself. Both Stock Adviser and Rule Breakers. 52% return up until the recent correction. I have bought at least 40 of their recommendations.

The people who are bullish on Zoom don't think of it as a ""smaller market"", because they think the company will build an entire ecosystem of products and services with the same technical competency that their main offering (video chat) displays.

It's the same reason David Gardner has held Amazon shares for longer than pretty much anyone except Jeff Bezos. He knew it was going to be much more than just an online book store."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Ha, exactly.  See, not ANYTHING :-)  


I've long told people that its impossible to make any conclusions on a short time scale.  There are too many different macroeconomic forces at play.  And honestly, you could invest in just about anything since 2008 and be way ahead.  Hell, a monkey throwing darts at stocks in 2009 would probably be rich today.  I tell friends all the time, don't mistake your fat investment account as you being brilliant when its 100% due to the fact that the federal government has been printing money nonstop for over a decade and pumping it directly into securities."

03/25/2021,stocks,That’s a very valid point. They’re tech is solid and if they continue to build off of it there’s a lot of upside.

Great ticker tho lol. Not surprised it rocketed after IPO as who doesn’t want to own AI? It’s the future"
03/25/2021,stocks,Agree  65 seems to be where it bounces up

03/25/2021,stocks,"Could be, but it’s expensive for a lottery ticket. If you know the industry, it could be a good bet as you might know the odds of it paying out are good, but it’s hard to gauge (for me) wo knowing anything about the product. All I can evaluate is that their revenues only grew 18%, they’re trading at 38x sales, and they’re losing a lot of money.

Just to give an example, another “hot industry” w speculative lottery tickets stocks is the weed companies. They’re somewhat comparable as many of these companies have similar market caps to C3AI, but have ~7x price to sales, and some have grown 300% YoY."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You seem to have a lot of insight. If their main product is a machine learning IDE, and there are multiple other products out there for free, why would a company choose to use them?

You mention IBM, Oracle- do they offer the same products as c3ai?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"That is really all I saw when I looked into the company, they were a bigger name when I was looking into the AI realm of companies.

What you’ll find with many of these companies is that they take open source software, put their own proprietary spin on it, package it up and sell it. It happens all the time (I’m in the IT industry and see it everywhere, hell RedHat was making a good living off of it until IBM purchased them!) 

Every major company offers a form of AI and their own spin on it. I am not sure if others have their own IDE for the it but wouldn’t be surprised as it’s also a very common thing for these big players to do. For example IBM has their own IDE for developing applications to run on WebSphere Application server, same with RedHat and their Jboss app server. I don’t know if they offer a similar IDE yet, but wouldn’t be surprised to see one come down the line."

If you are new investor the covid crash was a -12% drop in a day. Not just one day mind you. Little did everyone know that he essentially bought “insurance” stocks and made a killing while everyone lost loads in the crash. What did he do with his massive gains? Turn around and buy in the bottom and try to pump the recovery and pump his spac. The media controls the narrative and the people who control the narrative are untrustworthy"
03/25/2021,stocks,"I think there are two things going on - one is that so much of the market is concentrated in a very few hands, and this is something the media does not want to bring attention to. The second is, how much of it all is actually fictitious and divorced from the reality on the ground, which is also not something the media at large would want to bring attention to. And of course it is indeed complex and driven by some random processes, but I hold that the two things above matter a lot more."

I have been using DO for many years.   

Hell, when my boss first came to me and asked if I could move the companies Joomla website from a server owned by the guy who made it to an in house server   ...  

Ordered the hardware and while I waited for it to arrive. Spun up a DO bare Linux server and followed guides and posts to create a Web server, add security and reporting tools, and learn how to import the site over.     

Wrecked the server many, many times. 3 minutes later was back with a fresh server. In a few weeks I went from a Linux novice user with zero Joomla experience to a guy that took a bare server, and had a LAMP server with reporting tools, Joomla and the companies website imported and running with no issues in less than an hour.   

As a teaching tool, it speed and low costs are invaluable."

03/25/2021,stocks,You can search based on RSI in thinkorswim
03/25/2021,stocks,"Tesla can be shifted by a tweet and ARK is tech so it goes up and down quite a bit.

But both generally go up in the end."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Tech is always risky because companies can easily take each other with new innovation. ARK is a new tech ETF working on EVs, genetics, etc any of these companies can end up failing to bring new tech to market or a new competitor may come up with better tech that kill their sales. Tesla is one of ARK's big investment.

At this point Tesla is far safer Than it used to be 4-5 years ago where no body was sure they will actually manage to make working cars, but now they have over a million cars on the road with no wide spread problems. but now all the established car makes are coming up with their new EV line up and it is possible one of them will come with something more attractive. 

In my opinion this is unlikely because we pretty much heard from everyone and all the competition have worse specs or much higher prices. but that is just my opinion and someone may come up with something"

If someone had a portfolio of only ""reddit favorites"" since mid February, he would probably be down 40%+.... Of course, most of us also have some indexs, and some other asset classes, so we aren't down 40%. But its strange how almost all us keep getting hit harder than the rest of the market."

SPY/VT should only be a part probably around 30% of a youths' long term investing portfolio consider  how strong growth stocks overall did in the past.
03/25/2021,stocks,"
First, at the beginning of the 2000 crash, interest rates were 6.50%. High PE ratio stocks don't like interest rates at all. Our current ones are near 0, big difference. If feds tomorrow decided to put rates at 6.50% like 2000, yes i think we would instantly crash hard. Fortunately, this will not happen.


Secondly, today's SP500 have a lot of growth monsters that have proven to be able to grow a lot over the years, and are expected to continue doing so. Amazon at 70 PE ratio isn't a big deal when you understand its planning around 40% growth a year. In 2000, diapers.com obviously wasn't going to sustain crazy growth over the years, it wasn't even making profits.


Lastly, i'd say today's feds are much more willing to use bazookas if needed. March 2020 was literally the worst thing possible with everything being force closed down and feds still managed to keep the stock market alive..."

Even the bigger companies are trading at a much higher P/E ratio than now.

One interesting thing about dot com burst is  sp500’s P/E ratio was actually at 27 while it’s at the dot com era peak, P/E wise the  peak was in 1999 at around 34. This basically creates a nightmare scenario for analysis because it really tricked people into thinking fundamentals  were actually catching up nicely and index rise is totally justified. Another thing is GDP growth during 1997-2000 also improved compared to the early 1990s. This dot com bubble is such a deadly trap because the fundamentals pre crash seem to point towards the stock rise is totally justified."

However, another way to look at it is that a significant number of everyday people went after the possibility of making money on a stock they heard about other people making money on in the news, mostly using a “free” app for the average person. They then started talking to other people who also had the same dream and allowed their initial hope of making maybe a few hundreds in profit snowball into believing they found a “loophole” of sorts to allow them to become 1 percenters. And in doing so, many either lost money because they bought too high to begin with or they chose not to take the actual profits they could have had if they hadn’t gotten caught up in an echo chamber.

03/25/2021,stocks,"All the DD around an imminent short squeeze requires people to outright disregard statutory reporting on short interest with the thesis being that (some hedge fund) is blatantly violating SEC regulations. That's certainly possible, but there is no evidence supporting it.

When the price of entry in the discussion is a literal conspiracy theory, it's hard to take any of the so called ""DD"" seriously, particularly when most of the ""DD"" these days is just supposing further conspiracies around ""short ladder attacks"".

There is no evidence that people consider here, nothing that could change their mind.  SI comes out in FINRA report with what, like 25%?  The stock trades sideways then down based on $GME missing earnings for the what, 8th quarter IN A ROW?  It's shared delusion at this point, it would be amusing if it weren't directly damaging people's finances."

Good luck to the big players who may be able to build the vehicles, but won't be able to get the batteries. They cannot even get enough microprocessors for their vehicles currently. Tesla makes its own batteries and chips. 

Just wait until every automaker wants batteries at the same time. It won't end well for them. In fact, I would argue the company still producing ICE vehicles will do very well for many years to come.

Also, buy Nickle and lithium miners."

Looking at just Tesla and VW battery plans. Tesla has plans to build a TON more batteries in 2030 then VW.

The major constraint on VW and other automakers is batteries. Tesla already has the jump on everyone in making batteries, some do not even have plans to make batteries, so they will be fighting with everyone else for the limited amount of batteries made by someone else like Panasonic. 

Got to remember that batteries are a limited supply, while making a car engine is not. Tesla could be making more cars, but they are being limited by batteries."

Older people struggle with low seating position. I never struggle with controls while driving. While on autopilot or fsd, how hard can it be to look down and change the temperature? The seats are the most comfortable seats Sandy Munroe has ever been in. Taycan is for the track and emphasis on manual control and feel and Tesla S is for daily driving and automated hands free driving. The majority of consumers are daily drivers, not Matt Farah."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I don't mean there is somthing wrong being a ok doing white collar worker more to say it has not the image of luxury and coolness like Apple has. So don't see people start buying Tesla's if they can buy European cars, especially because american cars are not seen as very good in europe with the exemption of Ford. Another problem is that Tesla's are inside not comfortable and not luxurious a lot of plastic and not stylish and German luxury are doing very well in that.

03/25/2021,stocks,"I would see Tesla at 200$ in the future. If they get the quality to a normal standard. I just read an article about companies not buying Tesla for their fleet because the service and quality is bad. Now they buy etrons and ids or any other e-car.

In Europa the car fleet market is around 300 billion so it is a large piece of cake"
03/25/2021,stocks,In Europe yes. Never saw a Tesla charger on my roadtrips through Germany. They are often not on the usual autobahn truckstops. They are a little offside because the truckstops want some licensing fees and Tesla wants everything for free. Innige is pretty big and also the usual local electric companies.

03/25/2021,stocks,How does that answer my question
03/25/2021,stocks,"Some people are happy simply owning a “name brand”. 
The standard set by Tesla’s definition of “luxury” is terribly low, hence why the beta test look, feel, and reliability of the current models. Eventually, other manufacturers, or even Tesla, will raise the bar. Present cars without glaring cost cutting measures, but are also  enjoyable to drive, comfortable to be in, and with complete tactile feel, but also have tech and  autonomous driving if it’s needed.  A compete package, not a beta test, is what the space needs.  Aiming for the bottom really isn’t it, but you can force yourself to believe that. There a woman for everyone."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Oh agreed that American cars are shit compared to EU or Japanese cars, but I don't think (at least here in Canada) that the connection between Tesla and American made has been done.

I mean, let's be honest. Apple was always a little bit of a poser product and plenty of people call them sheeps 🐑,  but they don't care and they swear by Apple.
I can kinda see the same fanatic attitude with Tesla which makes me think they might stick around.

But like you pointed out, that might be very market dependent. Maybe Europe with their access to good European cars will drift away from Tesla. We'll see. 

In any case, Tesla real potential will be in battery tech, solar and self driving software."
03/25/2021,stocks,"OK so let's say tesla implodes to under-400, which I don't find  impossible if investors stay spooked on the market and pull out of growth plays. I agree that Tesla being in the S&P500 is sketch when so many pensions/retirements depend on S&P500 but realistically, how much damage could a tesla implosion do? 

Tesla market cap is just a grain of sand compared to the entire S&P no?"
03/25/2021,stocks,">	Lol, that's because Tesla didn't ship any cars to Europe those months.

That’s false. You make it sound like Tesla was supply constrained, but I’m in Europe and have been checking Tesla’s configurator for Model 3 regularly, since December or so. The reported estimated delivery time was always about one month.

I also don’t follow the logic by which you criticize me for “using a single data point” when I reported a sales statistic for 9 European countries, and you counter it with a statistic covering only 3 countries. Come on. Cherry picking what helps your argument?"

03/25/2021,stocks,I'm providing my background to add to my response I have not spent time to research the individual you mentioned.
03/25/2021,stocks,Yeah I still have my doubts the way I see it the real power of Tesla at the moment is that they are a marketing machine but a lot is tied to Elon Musk and his fanboys( dont't mean not meant as an insult). the most technologies you name they are not very far ahead in my opinion. So I have my doubt if Elon Musks does something wrong or says something wrong I got the feeling everything can go downhill.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Great, Tesla's valuation requires them to dominate the market not just sell to fanboys."
03/25/2021,stocks,Nope. Not in a market-cap weighted index that has so many ties to so many passive and active index funds. Same problem as each of the FAANG weights but exponentially more of an issue.
03/25/2021,stocks,"Again, Tesla is dependent on shipping these cars over. They will have some inventory in Europe at all time or small shipments may come in during the quarter, but they will be significantly bigger or smaller depending on times. Towards the end of a quarter, Tesla will opt to ship more cars near the manufacturing plant to maximize sales. Especially towards the end of the fiscal year. Shipping cars from the US to Europe takes at least a month, as you can see from the numbers I shared. So yes, they've been supply constrained. The estimated delivery time is an estimate as the word says. Again, use some logic.

> I also don’t follow the logic by which you criticize me for “using a single data point” when I reported a sales statistic for 9 European countries, and you counter it with a statistic covering only 3 countries. Come on. Cherry picking what helps your argument?

9 countries or 3 of the biggest countries are both fairly limited but also comparable sample sizes. In this case it doesn't matter because all those countries are dependent on the same shipments, so as long as supply is the constraint, if one country sells more the rest sells more too. The reason I used these 3 is not because I cherry picked them, but because they're the only countries updating registrations daily and a fair representation of the European market.

This is not comparable at all to using only a portion of the quarter when you know Tesla's deliveries throughout a quarter highly differ.  You can simply look back at past quarters and you'll see that Tesla follows the same pattern EVERY quarter. They sell very little in Europe in the first two months and then skyrocket for the final month. Again, all of this is common sense..."
03/25/2021,stocks,"You’re a capitalist. You don’t have morals? Capitalism is a concept, only people and their intentions and actions exist.

Many deciders don’t have morals and many do. It is a personal choice where to draw the line. For instance would you directly kill someone for profit? Easy line to draw."
03/25/2021,stocks,"The point is Tesla fanbois only ever apply wrights law to Tesla, they conveniently ignore that it applies to their competitors as well. In which case there is no point in mentioning it in reference to Tesla. It isn’t some intangible benefit that only those employed by Elon get.

He went from being a fucking dinghy captain to a top analyst at ARK with zero experience in the investing or banking industry. There are many young people working at ARK with similar stories, I suggest you peruse LinkedIn and see for yourself. Might explain why their funds are structured so spectacularly poorly."
03/25/2021,stocks,You're a manufacturing engineer in the automotive industry and you don't know who Sandy Munro is? He's been doing your job 5x longer than you have and is one of the industry's top consultants...
03/25/2021,stocks,True he is not thinking about investors really. If you see some of his interviews he is all in on the opportunity because he really wants to do it. It’s weird but the wealth creation is just a byproduct of the innovation he makes. I am worried about a. If they stop innovating b. If Musk actually is no longer with Tesla for whatever reason. So as long as he keeps innovating it will be out with the old and in with the new
03/25/2021,stocks,"Cool story, what are they doing currently?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"Of course it applies to competitors - but Tesla is the biggest EV manufacturer? So they benefit most - the rest of them have to catch up to take advantage. 

I have - what other funds have done better than them in the scope of 24 months?"
03/25/2021,stocks,"But they are literally doing it...

Well I tell you what - next time when you come across a really complex project - set yourself an ambitious deadline and see if you hit it. 

And then who cares?

If they are one, two, five years our - FSD is literally a trillion dollar opportunity- it’s coming."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Who cares about being the largest EV manufacturer when it’s still such a small industry, the other companies are an order of magnitude larger in manufacturing. They will benefit more than Tesla.

03/25/2021,stocks,Whys that? Because its the 100-200 nasdaq? Im genuinely curious as I'm still learning and take all advice/ opinion so i can do my own research
03/25/2021,stocks,"QQQJ is not the Nasdaq 100.  QQQJ uses the ""NASDAQ Next Generation 100"" as its benchmark. So, it does use 100 tickers listed on the NASDAQ, but they are not the top 100 by market cap.  Instead, it is a select group of 100 stocks that are expected to be some of the best ""next generation"" stocks; newer tickers that are expected to do well. By definition, this is a higher risk group of companies.  QQQM (along with QQQ) uses the NASDAQ 100 as the benchmark.  The NASDAQ 100, is 100 of the largest companies by market cap, so it includes companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc.  The top tickers in QQQJ are ROKU, Crowdstrike, Viacom, The Trade Desk, ETSY, Zscaler, etc."
03/25/2021,stocks,"Thats what i meant by the nasdaq. 

I guess i didnt realize it wasnt the actual 100-200 top stocks in the nasdaq. I knew qqq/ qqqm were the same and tracked the top 100 tho.

03/25/2021,stocks,"The Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Fund (Fund) is based on the NASDAQ Next Generation 100 Index (Index).

As a result, the portfolio may be concentrated in mid-capitalization stocks.

03/25/2021,stocks,Gotcha. I just looked briefly at this and didn't realize it was the 100-200 top stocks. I've never invested in QQQJ.  Knowing that makes me think that it is a little less risky than I initially thought.  I might still consider it medium risk.  Thanks for the info.

03/25/2021,stocks,"As a  AMD fanboy, I agree with you completely. Intel has many advantages compared to AMD. Intel has set many industry standards.  And only nerds care what CPU is in their computer.  

That said, intel does have a rough road ahead, but they're far from dead.  That's why I brought intel, those dividends and they're cheaper than AMD. I honestly plan on holding both, but AMD is current overpriced and I don't see it pushing past higher than 90 unless they release another banger like the ryzen series."
03/25/2021,stocks,"I don't think so. Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy and took money from Microsoft just so they don't become a monopoly. Apple came out swinging out of no where and took on Nokia.

This is what happened here, but at a smaller scale. Intel stagnated like Nokia, AMD came in with innovative competitive products and took customers away from Intel.

AMD already made the right managerial decisions. It is Intel that just did, and the stock reacted. I don't see how you can use this argument when AMD has Lisa Su in I think 2016 or before it, where Intel just put a new CEO this last quarter lol. Like this literally just happened, that argument cannot possibly work.

I think I'm giving AMD credit for what they have shown then can do, and hoping they continue to do it. The stock price already reflects what Intel has done (fuck up) and going forward there is hope they can do well. Short term though, they failed on a goal for 5 years (7nm) and now will be spending another $20B extra and were supposed to somehow be excited about that lol.

I appreciate the perspective. I don't think they're going to stop existing, but I'm not bullish on them in the short term. I think they'll go down before they go up, and hope they can get things together in the future. It's not like I'm gonna benefit from having a bear view on them, and I don't have that view on many companies. It's just that one can only take so many fuck ups as a consumer and investor into their products. I cannot believe it took them this many billions and years to wake the fuck up."

It’s used as a gift hard to sell some people buy a paper share of a company they made a lot of money on. Let’s say your parents buy you 100 shares of a company the day your born they may also buy a paper share to hang in your room and in 18years when you learn about stocks you may have a fortune and a paper stock as a trophy. I buy them for friends kids as bday presents. The the parents buy a few shares for their portfolio.

03/25/2021,stocks,"You’re correct. AMC is a fantastic, money-making company, its those darn shorts that ruined their perfectly sound business.

Just think about your logic. You’re saying that they needed to pay a large debt but couldn’t because the stock was low. Fine. But ask yourself how they accumulated such debt. BECAUSE THE COMPANY was performing badly- the shorts didn’t make the company do that 😂

They just made it harder to acquire capital to get them through BANKRUPTCY. Again, the shorts were smart to short AMC during quarantine.

I have experienced the following crashes first hand: 1987, 1993, 1999, and 2008.

A third grader can see the crash coming. My guess 120 days.

It's a company you can ""invest"" in and not trade. Just Google it and look at all the companies it controls.

Just sit tight and save your money and wait until the Dow Jones is around 15,000. Again start reading everything in finance so you can become a ""professional"". You want cashflow from every investment. In other words, you want them to send you money each day, month, and year.

This site is about gambling and speculation."
03/25/2021,stocks,Any good studies or books to help start?
03/25/2021,stocks,"You need to start with control at the basic level. Yourself. 

This has to be a game. A fun game. You will not enjoy the process and  the power that comes with financial control.

If you cannot save 30% of your salary each each month you will not have the discipline to control millions. 

 The lack of discipline will keep you with the 90% of the consumers that just float through life. The simplest way is to buy 1 silver dollar coin each week, and put it in a safe. This will give you a sense of progress and mental control.

If you make $40,000 a year in just five years (if you just get the average level of raises) a quarter of a million dollars will float through you fingers. Do you see the big picture?

You want control. You want the control to be fun. You need to think of money like a video game. You have a dashboard on a video game right? You want you own dashboard on you progress sent to you every month. 

You need to hire a simple bookkeeper to start taking in your paper receipts of revenue (salary) and giving you feedback on where that $40,000 is going each year. 

Again in a few years almost $250,000 will move through you fingers. You want someone else to tell you how that money flowed. It either flows 2 ways. It flows to consumption. Or it flows to investment, or saving (minus taxes of course but you will learn in a few years rich people don't pay taxes. We know the tax laws).

So hire your book keeper.  And begin creating your monthly dashboard. You can save over a $100,000 in 5 years.  Start with the baby step of control by getting a bookkeeper and then a CPA. You want a clear and simple picture of how weak, or how strong you really have become.

You can save in 1 year more than you could trading stocks. Right? You just proved to yourself.

This is your first baby step. It will cost you less than a $100.00 a month to get that financial control. If you can't save 30% of your money for 2 years you have no business trading.

Next read everything. Start building your own body of knowledge."
03/25/2021,stocks,Interesting advice. Thanks...
03/25/2021,stocks,"Oh ok, I was speaking of an options play I apologize. You are correct though. 

LOGI long dated calls are just such easy easy money. I love their chart and once GME finally wraps up I will be going very very heavy into LOGI calls for end of year and various throughout 2022/23.

I paid 1.9 per contract for 100$ when they had their flash crash on November. I paid $1900 for that and sold at $120...I also had 2+ 90c 2+ 95c sold the 90/95 early to buy 10+ 105c


So in total I would've needed 2000 shares at $75~ for $105,000 to make the profit I did but I spent $6k in premiums instead on what to me is an AAA play every time with LOGI. They're an amazing company leading a growing sector and crush earnings every single time almost it's great. 

I don't dabble too much in options. I stay with shares myself as the foundation. Boy do I wish I had the cash to have been able to execute and buy those shares. Even now Id still be break even on the shares ugh! Anyway Im rambling"

03/25/2021,stocks,"In and out. With this choppy market play both sides. Watch the pattern gap up retrace gap up retrace. Tomorrow will be another green day. Retrace around 130pm then red day Friday\* though staying above 383/385. Gap up Monday. 

I'll be honest. There is limited driving pressure upwards from a psychological perspective but people are quickly losing faith in the Fed's ability to control inflation going forward. Watch for a flex of the tools to around choppy move up to 400 within two weeks before retrace to mid 390s.

\*Barring any significant news

But again play both sides, puts on the gap up, calls on the discount on the way down, never try to hold past 20% profit a hard rule. Your long positions just stay diversified money is flowing in and out of each sector right now so it'll be neutral or a loss even if you are well diversified, just be patient on that front.

One of the the biggest mistake you can make IMO.

For these 2 tables on the Gains and losses sheet columns N  & S:

Do you think it is a better idea to keep increasing the data range and pull down the formulas so the averages are for all time. Or have it calculating from the last 3 months for example?

I have not pasted any new data in yet, still figuring out what exactly you paste where.

1 thing at a glance: on the paper trading sheet why is  ""score grouping"" (a formula) to the left of "" Social score date of purchase "" (a value). Is it not easier to swap the columns so you can paste all 4 values columns in 1 go or have i missed a reason why its set up this way?

03/25/2021,stocks,"I appreciate the input! I actually redid the pivot tables to pull directly from the raw data instead of the % sheet to fix exactly that.


As for the spacing in the grouping column, I just add a blank column in the temp spreadsheet I use to copy / paste the data from the scraper, so when I paste it into the Google sheet I paste it all in one go


As for the length of time I keep the data in, you bring up a good point that I'll probably want to start purging after a while so the old data doesn't weigh down any new trends. I think starting tomorrow I'll delete anything more than 30 days old
