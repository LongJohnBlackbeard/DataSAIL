2021-04-22 17:27:25,wallstreetbets,You know not all patents are valued the same?
2021-04-22 17:15:21,wallstreetbets,So you know if BB has licensed any of these sellable patents.

2021-04-22 17:34:00,wallstreetbets,yeah but average seems to be $500k per patent!!
2021-04-22 17:15:40,wallstreetbets,?
2021-04-22 17:37:00,wallstreetbets,if it's priced in...why would chen decide to sell? it makes no sense. patent is gold!
2021-04-22 17:28:40,wallstreetbets,"Shows what you know...anyone who demands high security like the govt, the army, etc uses blackberry still.

And is written above, which you apparently missed, is that they hold a ton of security and encryption patents 👍"
2021-04-22 17:17:50,wallstreetbets,I don’t think his lawyer lets him say anything about any stock anymore.
2021-04-22 17:42:55,wallstreetbets,its possible. but elon doesn't have that much cash to buy.
2021-04-22 17:32:29,wallstreetbets,"Yep holds a lot of value, clearly. 

It’s ok, you’re BlackBerry fan boy from back in the day."
2021-04-22 17:34:50,wallstreetbets,"No...I use apple products, just wanted to point out your ignorance for everyone to see that you were just spewing unintelligent and uninformed garbage out of that cock holster of yours 💁‍♂️👍

Mission accomplished 💪😂"
2021-04-22 17:38:40,wallstreetbets,And you think BB products are just so earth shattering in spite of the stock price? A stock with a high of $14 in the last 5 years???? Okie Dokie. Just because some in WSB have a hard on for it doesn’t make it reality.
2021-04-22 17:42:34,wallstreetbets,"I didn't say anything about its stock you fucking dolt 😂

I said what I said...that you don't know what the fuck blackberry has and doesn't, and you clearly shouldn't be respected in anything you say regarding blackberry (or anything else since I'm sure you are the type that loves talking arbitrarily out your ass on subjects you have zero knowledge of, like a true douchebag does 💁‍♂️) and I was successful in my aim.

What's it like to be made a fool of in front of the sub? 🤔"
2021-04-22 18:02:07,wallstreetbets,"You’re the dolt. You’re in WSB saying who cares about stock price because BB has great tech. You don’t see the irony in that do you? 

Let me spell it out for you - the tech ain’t earth shattering as exemplified by the stock price which hasn’t done shit in at least 5 fucking years dumbass. Go back down into your moms basement to look at GILF porn you fucking homo."
2021-04-22 18:04:01,wallstreetbets,Lmao ahhhhh I love just destroying someone like you in public...thank you so much; you made my day 👍💁‍♂️😂
2021-04-22 18:08:19,wallstreetbets,You need help. Professional help or another unemployment check. Both likely.
2021-04-22 18:11:38,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I'm doin great...even better now thanks to you 😂💪"

2021-04-22 19:30:11,wallstreetbets, Guessing Biden is removing tariffs on foreign steel. Just a guess I’m coming from someone that used to work at the company it’s a shit show
2021-04-22 19:36:17,wallstreetbets,Steel prices coming out of 2020 have gone insane. Apparently during the Covid lockdowns we tapered off the amount of steel we were producing and with the rebound in demand foundry’s have been slow to get back to full capacity. That’s the same story that can be said for most commodities right now though...
2021-04-22 19:50:48,wallstreetbets,a board of director of X left to serve the Biden administration to head the American Rescue Plan. Read what you want into that
2021-04-22 19:33:33,wallstreetbets,I don’t know how they could be with a couple trillion of infrastructure stuffs getting ready to pass. Unless another steel company got the contract?
2021-04-22 19:44:12,wallstreetbets,"i know i keep hearing from my brake shoe vendor etc brake drums and shoe cores are getting harder for them to get right away. 

i asked about this a month or so back when he mentioned it to me on here. i don’t think i got a response."
2021-04-22 19:38:46,wallstreetbets,"Biden is a neoliberal in international affairs, which means getting rid of all protectionist policy like tariffs and probably tossing as many of the NTBs as he can, too. For all the virtue signalling we do about how bad China is for torturing and brainwashing and killing their own people, we do zilch about it. Fuck those American steelworkers in the rust belt, anyway, there's cheap Chinese steel to be had.

To be fair, some neolibs actually do believe that doing business with China is the best way to get them to re-examine their domestic policies by exposing them to our culture, values, business practices, etc. Bill Clinton gave a famous speech about this during his years in office."

2021-04-22 19:43:37,wallstreetbets,"so put the machine in a room where the kids can't easily get to it.

if there're no rooms like that. then teach them it's dangerous. you know.. like a parent should do.  PTON says in the manual it isn't a kiddy ride.  parents can unplug the machine when not using it."

2021-04-22 18:24:02,wallstreetbets,"In case you were unaware, MVIS has been for sale for quite a while. One of the members of MVIS's Board of Directors (Judy Curran) was just in a meeting called the Ricardo Mobility Summit 2021 regarding the Digitization of Product Development.  

Attending were the following people from several companies:

- John Bogema (Ford)
- Marc LaPlante (Ricardo Software)
- Przemek Tomczak (Senior VP of KX and First Derivatives)
- Tara Prakriya (General Manager for Edge Platforms, Microsoft)
- Mike Gery (Director of Advanced R&D, PACCAR)

They spoke about being very enthused with what progress they've seen so far, and several companies are rumored to want to buy out MVIS, with the latest estimate I've seen be at $108/share.

The following companies I've seen rumored to express interest

- Ford/Google Deal
- Apple Deal
- Microsoft Deal (Due to HoloLens 2)
- Tesla Deal (Though to be fair, not likely due to Elon being Elon)

Lidar A Sample was supposed to be promised in April timeframe, and the original Q1 results were meant to be announced in May, but have now been moved forward to April 29th. Which means the Lidar announcement will likely be announced then in next Thursday's after hours. Optimistically speaking, I expect this to shoot share price in around the $27/share region, as the rise to $24/share was just showing that they were on target.

Disclaimer: I'm currently long on MVIS with 12485 shares at $19.39/share average."
2021-04-22 19:30:01,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-22 19:41:30,wallstreetbets,Nice! I have been in for years and it is Finally time! They have the best lidar and already in Microsoft hololens! Augmented reality and lidar are two of the hottest sectors right now. I think they get acquired foe about $30 by Microsoft by end of July.

2021-04-22 18:42:32,wallstreetbets,"The only time it will be confirmed will be when the buyout is announced. If it wasn't a rumor, we wouldn't be at $13/share now. No need to be bearish."
2021-04-22 19:09:34,wallstreetbets,Have you been taking stupid pills again?
2021-04-22 19:08:34,wallstreetbets,"First if you look at MVIS price history it’s all up and down, it was up today and yesterday over 0 news. Down 8% could be another normal Tuesday. Obvious you don’t know what you’re talking about.

2.) how is it already priced in? Someone had to buy a unit and dismantle it before MVIS admitted it was theirs, and they saw a run up before that even happened. A confirmation of a contract will be YUGE and can’t already be priced in because we don’t know the details. Many of us are holding for a buyout"
2021-04-22 19:24:28,wallstreetbets,"Also:

Some history from our last ER:

The price jumped 140% last year between April 30th (earnings date announcement) to May 7th (earnings). It jumped 270% from April 30th to May 5th."

2021-04-22 19:12:28,wallstreetbets,I'm holding a few hundred shares for the long haul but that $109 PPS seems pretty far fetched. I'm expecting around $30 and I'll be very happy with that.
2021-04-22 19:07:15,wallstreetbets,We’re at $13 because people are throwing all their money at it in hopes it’s another GME short squeeze.

2021-04-22 18:36:06,wallstreetbets,"Honest question, just wanted to put it in a upcoming MVIS thread for traction.

Why does iBorrowDesk show 16 shares available rn? The fee is also steep AF. I only really became an ape during the GME stuff and was checking iBorrowDesk daily and have only seen that kind of numbers when the squeeze was still popping off. Is there a reason why there'd be so few shares available because at 33% float I don't understand why the numbers on that site look like they do.
Poor af dude with 30 shares at $13.47 avg"

2021-04-22 19:17:41,wallstreetbets,"Don't get attached to arbitrary numbers. Do you think it is likely the price will still increase? Buy. If not, don't."
2021-04-22 18:43:10,wallstreetbets,Math is hard
2021-04-22 18:15:25,wallstreetbets,"They just announced earnings will be April 29 which is a week early. Come for the squeeze, stay for the buyout."
2021-04-22 19:07:25,wallstreetbets,"My understanding is that just includes shares on Interactive Brokers, and not anywhere else."
2021-04-22 17:47:38,wallstreetbets,Because they’re cunts?
2021-04-22 17:54:22,wallstreetbets,Because it’s overtaken GME as the most talked about stonk and the mod working today is the biggest GME bag holder so that doesn’t work for him.
2021-04-22 19:02:37,wallstreetbets,There are lots of folks in this sub who are holding major bags with GME...like 300/share type bags. There’s not much short interest left to burn so nothing to move it up and other stocks don’t get the love from the masses yet and a lot of posters are trying to keep GME getting a ton of hits.
2021-04-22 18:12:29,wallstreetbets,About to be 12B to 17B.
2021-04-22 17:37:48,wallstreetbets,Change your name puss
2021-04-22 17:36:17,wallstreetbets,Last earnings call created a huge run up AH. This earnings call will be to confirm the demo and best in class is still on track which was confirmed in the last one. Bullish call -> bullish on buyout.
2021-04-22 17:54:09,wallstreetbets,The price jumped 140% last year between April 30th (earnings date announcement) to May 7th (earnings). It jumped 270% from April 30th to May 5th.
2021-04-22 19:51:59,wallstreetbets,I am one of those people - average now 4.56 I was in since .28 but sold and had to buy back a few times. It’s hard! I’m holding with diamond hands now 💎
2021-04-22 18:45:02,wallstreetbets,So true. I forgot how low it used to be!
2021-04-22 19:10:18,wallstreetbets,Lol. Well I missed that.
2021-04-22 18:22:36,wallstreetbets,Earnings good or bad? Need a retard to do a DD on it!
2021-04-22 18:26:39,wallstreetbets,how can you be a bagholder holding the most valuable asset on earth right now?
2021-04-22 17:58:28,wallstreetbets,"I holding it, but i'm fairly sure all that and buyout potential is already priced into the stock. I doubt the stock will move much at all on the 29th.

Although I think its going to be a company like samsung, google, or sony who buy it and not microsoft for use in their phone camera suites."
2021-04-22 18:49:15,wallstreetbets,"The earnings itself are useless. We’re all waiting for news on the highly anticipated status of their LiDAR module demo. I know nothing is guaranteed but barring a surprise “we’re late” announcement, MVIS will easily hit 19+ next Friday

I’ve been all in for 3 months otherwise I’d sell everything to buy more"
2021-04-22 18:36:07,wallstreetbets,"It is more about the LIDAR created for autonomous vehicles and business with microsoft for the Hololens 2 and IVAS, and the possibility of a buyout or major strategic investment.  Too many good things possible to not make money with MVIS."
2021-04-22 19:06:18,wallstreetbets,"Some history from our last ER:

The price jumped 140% last year between April 30th (earnings date announcement) to May 7th (earnings). It jumped 270% from April 30th to May 5th.

bulllishhhh."
2021-04-22 18:36:01,wallstreetbets,says the guy who's probably been averaging down his 200 calls for the last month lolol
2021-04-22 19:56:03,wallstreetbets,"To put it into a little perspective, during that timeframe it was trading at $0.25 a share and went to $0.80.

It’s way easier for a penny stock to 3x after good earnings."

2021-04-22 17:57:24,wallstreetbets,Meaningless to me if the market goes up or goes down. I will lose a lot of money regardless.
2021-04-22 17:24:42,wallstreetbets,"It's summer. Expect bears to pop out and make noises for a while.

Counter argument is the world reopening will artificially show growth but it will look like growth. Money printers will keep printing. Inflation will keep prices going up.


Hunger games. May the odds be in your favor."

(I have the utmost respect for Jeremy Grantham.)"
2021-04-22 18:20:42,wallstreetbets,"This is obviously correct because it is confirmation bias for me, PLUS

5 = 420.69 

Im in! 🐻"
2021-04-22 19:44:07,wallstreetbets,"First, there is a lot of work on this so thank you for that. Easy counter argument would be that you do not have confirmation for any of it. Is it time to take some profits on longs? Sure, but you litterally could have done this analysis anytime since June and been destroyed by shorting the market, save for some relatively small selloffs along the way. Precious metal is also a terrible play if you like money, the pop is always way too short lived to reasonably unload physical but metal ETFs are better for that Imo. Reopening, continued QE, a higher rate of growth from a global perspective being centered in the US while the rest of the world still battles covid fallout, and more money in the average Joe's account (in the US) with higher emphasis on saving and investing will blow your second and third strat up. VIX isnt a bad play, long dated SPY puts might not be terrible but your trying to time the market at that point. Summary of my Ted talk would be wait for confirmation and maybe sell some long date OTM call credit spreads or DEEP out the money puts to catch the bottom on some stocks you want to own, but IV is low for that so just make hay while the sun shines"
2021-04-22 18:31:43,wallstreetbets,That’s that girthy dd I like to see
2021-04-22 19:14:17,wallstreetbets,"Just say ""buffet indicator"" and save all some time.  SPY is going DOWN"

2021-04-22 19:37:13,wallstreetbets,"This bear literotica is beautiful.   There's more money in the market than ever before, meaning the base is steadily rising. Sure we'll probably have a correction soon but reaching anywhere near 2008 levels would be ridiculous"

2021-04-22 17:25:19,wallstreetbets,I like batman patterns
2021-04-22 19:26:03,wallstreetbets,"Its all bullshit and you guys should have realized that quickly. The method this guy is trusting is based on people. Not the soul-less AI that the average investor is going against.

Also - wrong. Everyone knows the markets are going up. Biden just said he wants to increase the capital gains tax. This means MMs will beef up their gains to cover the additional taxes.

2021-04-22 18:59:38,wallstreetbets,"This may be true for a while, but ""growth"" will get us back to Winter 19 levels of spending and social mobility, at most. Actual growth and transactional spending will not reach new highs for possibly years to come. That means a few more months of ""growth"" before drastic violent stagnation relative to the past few months, and a mean hangover from the spending we've done as a country.

Timing it is impossible, but the market has been looking for a reason to tank for months and dips at the slightest sign of bad news. 

I'm fully deleveraged now and considering some conservative bearish positions, and playing recovery Stocks around their next earnings."
2021-04-22 17:41:49,wallstreetbets,Why would you have such a low self-appreciation?

2021-04-22 16:39:02,wallstreetbets,Hopefully by end of October $30 & eoy $40
2021-04-22 16:54:59,wallstreetbets,There’s a pretty sour taste over SPAC’s right now and PSFE is the brainchild of Bill Foley’s SPAC. Nothing really sparking excitement in PSFE right now so its probably not on many’s radar.
2021-04-22 17:15:00,wallstreetbets,Poor growth numbers compared to other fintech companies.

2021-04-22 18:51:25,wallstreetbets,"Uwmc is getting some positive press now, short interest is holding it down. With that dividend and another strong quarter this will jump nicely.  Not going to be overnight but is a solid buy at these prices"
2021-04-22 16:18:49,wallstreetbets,I wish this stock would do something besides rot.
2021-04-22 18:10:41,wallstreetbets,I actually saw a green on my UWMC holding today for a few minutes!!! Took a screen shot  of it just in time! 😁 It will hit at least $10 in May IMO. Highest close since 4/13 and highest intraday high since 4/8 with markets crapping out. This one is ready to run up into earnings and then Russell addition announcement.  https://imgur.com/Ag04BfR.jpg
2021-04-22 19:32:27,wallstreetbets,$UWMC has very strong dividends and everyone predicted that it will reach at least $9.5. Now it’s very undervalued.
2021-04-22 16:27:02,wallstreetbets,"Genuinely  curious, what is the thesis here?"

2021-04-22 19:39:42,wallstreetbets,Jesus. And I thought I laid down a crazy yolo with 8k shares. You have balls my friend.
2021-04-22 18:15:53,wallstreetbets,The prophecy!
2021-04-22 16:34:01,wallstreetbets,"Buy low, sell high."
2021-04-22 17:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Housing market will churn for years to come. Rates are staying under 4 for years. The refi boom isn't exactly dead either.

$UWMC is incredibly fundamentally sound. xxx% YoY increase in business. Strong guidance issued and affirmed by Mat for continued growth. Mortgage brokers are the future of the industry -- anyone who has bought a home knows the benefit in working with local people.

Plus all of their advantages are proprietary technology.

Never bet against real-estate. I can hold this for years."
2021-04-22 16:33:49,wallstreetbets,It has been trending up this week. We are going into earnings which should be a blowout.
2021-04-22 19:50:32,wallstreetbets,"I like this company. Stock has been a pile of shit so far. I think we're at an inflection point here. From everything I heard from the actual brokers dealing with UWMC, upcoming quarter will blow the last one out of the water.  Two blow out quarters in a row will make Wallstreet notice... I  think"
2021-04-22 16:41:25,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-22 18:55:41,wallstreetbets,"""Never bet against real estate.""

Boy do I have a book they made into a movie for you."
2021-04-22 16:40:39,wallstreetbets,"What does this company even do? This downtrend has been going on for so long, and if those earnings aren’t a fucking blowout and a half, it’ll keep going down"
2021-04-22 16:44:18,wallstreetbets,"So I'm a commercial underwriter for one of the largest credit unions in the country. I have been trying to find this out and nobody really has a clue. Its Ike a marketing scheme mortgage company as a middle man. Anyone can be a lender and if you recruit people you make more money. That said, they do a ton of business. I'm passing at the moment."
2021-04-22 16:46:32,wallstreetbets,"So if they really do a lot of business, and apparently they’re the number one mortgage company when it comes to actual mortgages given (correct me if I’m wrong), then do you think they’ll perform well when it comes to earnings?"
2021-04-22 19:57:59,wallstreetbets,They are a wholesale operation. They do tons of volume. it’s a completely different model than the retail channel I would assume your CU does
2021-04-22 16:49:38,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure. I've been really looking into it. I have an analyst on the sly digging shit up. I know most everyone is 1099 and why you would use the service is beyond me. The issue is if you and I each sign up, we could find 3 or 4 people to use us. They have that happen times 1MM but only a few do big business. I'm on the fence. I may throw the chips in for 1000 shares if it hits 7."
2021-04-22 17:04:08,wallstreetbets,I work with them daily. They are massive. The big reason why brokers use them is because of rates and turnaround. They have a two week turnaround right now and the industry average is over 30 days. They are a mortgage wholesaler so they keep the ultra prime stuff and sell off the stuff they don't want. This dramatically reduces their exposure if defaults become a problem.
2021-04-22 18:48:44,wallstreetbets,You might be too late for 7
2021-04-22 16:53:03,wallstreetbets,"Got it, thanks for the advice! Good luck!"
2021-04-22 17:04:58,wallstreetbets,Very good post. Thanks.
2021-04-22 19:31:25,wallstreetbets,Indeed. I think lowest was 7.20 and change. But that's where I would buy in.

2021-04-22 17:06:48,wallstreetbets,"Lol I bought at 10 like 3 months ago, so I'm now pretty much even"
2021-04-22 16:37:16,wallstreetbets,Maaaan... I bought back when it was 3.25. sold it when it jumped up to 18. Sold at 15 tho. Reentered a month ago when it dipped below 8 and I've been averaging down since. But.... I brought my average down to 6.30 and when market closed yesterday I put in an AH order in for 7 that got filled. I was tired if averaging down. One more day.... Should have waited one more day...
2021-04-22 16:22:50,wallstreetbets,"Damn. I had my doubts about ocugen, wrongly, but well played brother enjoy your tendies. You have prevailed."

2021-04-22 16:27:24,wallstreetbets,"Bought today first time,
Looking for tommorows obvious dip to load up more"
2021-04-22 17:25:42,wallstreetbets,"It made up for the tumble the rest of my portfolio took today. I first bought Ocugen at the start of February for 5, averaged myself up to 11, bought more around 10, bought more as it dipped. Sadly still only managed to average down to 8 before today but at least it’s showing me green! When it hit 18 I should have cashed out and bought back in later for much cheaper but I wouldn’t be here if I was smart."
2021-04-22 17:00:49,wallstreetbets,"I brought some a while ago when it was 1.86 based on the posts on pennystocks, sold half at ~13 and have been letting the rest ride. I was slightly worried about the recent slide but I was still in profit even if it crashed because of the previous sale. Hoping to see this rocket further if it gets approved. 

Still trying to work out an exit p/t though for the remaining shares."
2021-04-22 18:29:00,wallstreetbets,Sup

...like? what? In order to **make** over $1M a year you'd you have to *realize* the gains which means *selling*...

So if you want to avoid a 40% long-term capital gains tax on the gains *over* $1M all you would have to do is 

a) **hold** for at least a year and then 

b) *not sell* enough to make more than $1M that year (a/k/a **hold**).

Sounds super challenging, I'll be sure to try not to realize enough long term cap gains to push me over that $1M threshold so that dollar #1,000,001 isn't taxed at 40% vs 20%. Saving that 20 cents would be very important to me."

Also this \~5k/year contribution limit adds up (anything you haven't used gets carried forward) and starts when you turn 18 (started back in 2009).

2021-04-22 17:25:04,wallstreetbets,"QUALITY IDEAS... 

If you’re looking for some good set-ups check these out.  Chances are they are breaking out or just about to begin a rally before they report. (Playing earnings is for chumps most of the money is made leading towards earnings or a couple of days after. Option prices & IV’s tend to be much lower vs on earnings day). 

- DKNG; moved all the way to the mid $70’s before collapsing back to the low $50’s formed a base and is picking up once again.  It will go into earnings at $65-$70

- DIS; the mouse has also been very quiet since reaching a new all time high just over $200. It was dead for the last month and finally started to gain momentum. Specially after HBO-MAX news and getting the Sony catalog. 

-JD.com; due to BABA it’s also been punished and hasn’t done shit in the last couple of months. Same set a base around $75 and reports in mid May. 

-T; AT&T has been dead for years and none of their business matter.  At this point it’s all about HBO-MAX.  Last time it had jumped over 5% on earnings news was over 5 years ago.  It will gradually creep up to $34-$35.  Cheap options.  

-NIKE; simply mid quarter drag and has been walloped by the recent hits to the DJI.  Sitting at it’s $128 resistance. So unless they announce any really bad news it’s already the cheapest it will be within its trading range. 

However do your own homework almost sure you’re agree in at least 2 of these. (For all of them you can but deep in the money calls for cheap and at least 1 - 2 months out)"

It’s because rich people hire you, rich people invest in the stock market, rich people are the first ones to create shell companies in Panama when taxes get high in USA and then they don’t pay tax at all. Taxing the rich has never worked for our economy in history, because rich people have the best lawyers and most access to leave the country or find loopholes. 
Sure the FAANG ceo’s will pay more taxes but at the cost of millions of jobs!

2021-04-22 19:14:59,wallstreetbets,Correct me if I’m wrong but considering the tax applies only to taxable accounts for those who earn over a million bucks a year this would only apply to a relatively small amount of people? And wouldn’t they just be incentivized to hold until another politician comes along to reduce it? I feel like a lot of broke idiots sold today based on a headline

2021-04-22 17:25:04,wallstreetbets,This sub is filled with kids and conspiracy theorists that think posting positions gives away something. When in reality it's essential to know that people on here aren't full of shit. Honestly sometimes I think the rule against posting positions is a good way for people who don't have positions to spew whatever garbage they want on here without getting called out. Honestly this sub is pretty cringe overall.

2021-04-22 17:56:00,wallstreetbets,I think the next big crash will upend a lot of shit and could be a major catalyst event for forming an entire new currency or market entirely. We’ll be thrown so hard and deep into chaos it will make the Great Depression look like a chucky cheese birthday party. Thats what I think.

2021-04-22 19:05:06,wallstreetbets,Thank you.
2021-04-22 16:56:36,wallstreetbets,Op is either 10 years behind. Or is from the future 😬

2021-04-22 16:52:07,wallstreetbets,Like low as shit I just always read and dont post much.  I guess one of my posts got some likes?
2021-04-22 16:38:17,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah brother, Cheers from Iraq.

🇺🇸😎🍻 👱🏻‍♀️👙"
2021-04-22 17:23:57,wallstreetbets,I would but it probably won't let me cause the fucking mods are pussies.
2021-04-22 17:26:21,wallstreetbets,I don't understand though...a YOLO is still a YOLO albeit I do agree some post too small YOLOs but if it's above $25k I thought it was ok.
2021-04-22 17:16:48,wallstreetbets,"Good call, paid $225,000 in taxes in the first quarter."
2021-04-22 17:07:00,wallstreetbets,Nah playa you the one with $20 in gains
2021-04-22 17:23:38,wallstreetbets,The effect it had on my FDs concerns me greatly
2021-04-22 17:23:49,wallstreetbets,"No but it keeps whales from joining in, thus slowing most of our momentum. So yeah it effects everyone in a way."
2021-04-22 17:24:14,wallstreetbets,"They just took out money which dropped the market which fucked me, I'm concerned."
2021-04-22 17:24:26,wallstreetbets,It does concern more casual traders. If the wealthy lose their appetite for stocks and the prices come down. Your $1000 becomes $500 really quickly.
2021-04-22 17:24:46,wallstreetbets,"Love the retards that say this shit. You realize a change like that makes big money want to pull out of the market, causing it to drop"
2021-04-22 17:15:57,wallstreetbets,Why tho? He hasnt sold yet its not considered capital gain yet
2021-04-22 19:19:54,wallstreetbets,Beep boop im a bot

2021-04-22 17:08:42,wallstreetbets,"y tho? looking at it, it just keeps going up"
2021-04-22 17:35:16,wallstreetbets,That sounds good actually

2021-04-22 18:49:21,wallstreetbets,Holy shit I’m going to base my entire portfolio off this prediction thank you 🙏🏽
2021-04-22 16:20:43,wallstreetbets,Awesome
2021-04-22 19:09:33,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that the whole point of theta gang? Collect  premiums to buy way otm weeklies?
2021-04-22 18:16:03,wallstreetbets,With how my week has gone financially that sounds like a very solid strategy...
2021-04-22 16:40:46,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-22 19:06:07,wallstreetbets,"Basically it would create huge fluctuations in the Economy and Market because it removes incentive to hold through lean times. 

It also completely changes the calculation of long term investments. Why invest in a startup that will take 3-5 years to turn a profit if you are going to have to take a massive risk against inflation and loss. Also, this will prob crash the bond and other markets since you know, those are long term investments to get a guarantee % which would now need to pay way higher interest rates to be worth it."
2021-04-22 19:07:41,wallstreetbets,it does.  everyone is gonna pull out before 20% goes away and the markets will utterly tank for a long long time
2021-04-22 19:30:48,wallstreetbets,doodahhhhhh
2021-04-22 17:01:02,wallstreetbets,"That is an important detail - but apparently not to this board, lol 😂"

2021-04-22 18:23:41,wallstreetbets,As is tradition
2021-04-22 17:41:11,wallstreetbets,In all honesty the mods have been saying that automod is fucking up recently. But the stuff about GME YOLOs being oversaturated is totally the case.
2021-04-22 17:21:14,wallstreetbets,I’m sure you did.....but if that’s the case you eating good homie
2021-04-22 17:25:53,wallstreetbets,They will all invest in real estate and I will live in a shack.
2021-04-22 17:17:38,wallstreetbets,How do you know he hasn’t sold?
2021-04-22 18:08:30,wallstreetbets,Lmao imagine bragging about being a wage slave
2021-04-22 17:13:58,wallstreetbets,They dumped after the last earnings call and took forever to recover is all.  It was a good report too.
2021-04-22 18:10:02,wallstreetbets,Imagine bragging about not having a real job
2021-04-22 18:10:57,wallstreetbets,I have a job. But i aint bragging about working a shitty 9-5

2021-04-22 16:20:57,wallstreetbets,ITS NOT OVER YET. STILL TIME TO WIN BABY
2021-04-22 15:40:06,wallstreetbets,Hahahahahahahaha
2021-04-22 17:46:41,wallstreetbets,So at no point it crossed your mind that you should maybe try and preserve some capital so that way you could have another shot at winning?
2021-04-22 19:09:33,wallstreetbets,You french fried when you were supposed to pizza.
2021-04-22 16:19:52,wallstreetbets,"Lol, literally lost the same amount and the same time frame.  Here I am on the adventure back up to 5K yolo'ing what i have left into hail mary plays like a true autistic retard."
2021-04-22 17:23:06,wallstreetbets,This is like the weird softcore they give at fertilization clinics. You still have enough left for a nice night out with your girlfriend and her boyfriend.
2021-04-22 15:56:18,wallstreetbets,Well done lmao
2021-04-22 15:57:11,wallstreetbets,Holy shit now do your retard dancey dance for the boys in charge

2021-04-22 19:13:03,wallstreetbets,Buying GME options have been too expensive.  Implied Volatility has dropped quite a bit. It's getting close to the average levels in January.  It would be a less dumb trade.
2021-04-22 19:19:09,wallstreetbets,So what happens to these guys that use leverage to acquire stocks and get wiped out there investment and brokerage?
2021-04-22 19:53:44,wallstreetbets,"i think ur chart is upside down, just rotate it 90 degrees"
2021-04-22 19:59:37,wallstreetbets,"It tanks because... Square... because the fucks that operate it are like all the crapto fuckers: bums who coughed up real money for made up bullshit and waited for enough fools to pile on that they pass for legit and make money off transactions now.

Nd bc they launched their IP and insiders sold on the same day.

So yeah, fuck COIN."
2021-04-22 16:04:20,wallstreetbets,womp womp

2021-04-22 19:38:00,wallstreetbets,"Lmao his sacrifice is aiding in GME to the moon.

*Sweet, Sweet, Loss Porn*"
2021-04-22 16:17:46,wallstreetbets,There's a point where you've lost so much money that it's no longer worth selling. Why recover 1% of your bet when There's a remote chance something big could happen and turn a profit?
2021-04-22 15:59:31,wallstreetbets,"Just flip your phone.  
Now you can cry while smiling :,)"

2021-04-22 19:50:07,wallstreetbets,They get a book deal and CNBC talks about them for weeks
2021-04-22 16:21:25,wallstreetbets,This is also my options strategy
2021-04-22 16:53:22,wallstreetbets,The guys that actually make money on options stagger their exits and start getting out the moment it hits green.
2021-04-22 17:03:43,wallstreetbets,"$96 is enough for a nice dinner or a few tanks of gas. You could save it, or let it light itself on fire because of the sunk cost fallacy."
2021-04-22 17:16:49,wallstreetbets,"The real question is, if you hadn’t bought into this trade already and saw these options priced as they are today, would you buy in or buy into a different trade? If you wouldn’t pay what they’re worth today, then they arnt worth holding. Holding is essentially the same as buying calls today that expire tomorrow. Sell and put that money in something that has a chance to make you more. Every dollar counts; the wealthy know that already. Ever met some stingy ass, penny pinching, rich person? Well that’s why they’re rich. They know the value of a dollar."
2021-04-22 17:42:55,wallstreetbets,Tax loss.

2021-04-22 19:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Whats a spread? Sir, I still dont know what options are and how they work."
2021-04-22 19:29:22,wallstreetbets,He wouldn’t even get that. He was margin called so anything that’s pulled out would be taken before he could withdraw it
2021-04-22 19:44:15,wallstreetbets,I didn't hear no bell.
2021-04-22 18:34:39,wallstreetbets,Wow. This is a great way to look at it. Doubling down can be a great strategy but so can cutting your losses and putting that money somewhere else.
2021-04-22 17:59:40,wallstreetbets,"What even is lost opportunity
Just buy, hold and forget"
2021-04-22 19:38:23,wallstreetbets,"Im holding 550 shares, this was gamble money"
2021-04-22 19:53:21,wallstreetbets,Oh no...
2021-04-22 19:48:26,wallstreetbets,"You should look up the sunk cost fallacy. That's literally all this guy is explaining. 

I personally love doubling down, ignoring logic, and holding to the bitter end."
2021-04-22 19:38:54,wallstreetbets,Why gamble? Should’ve bought more shares
2021-04-22 19:40:35,wallstreetbets,"Sir, This is r/wallstreetbets and I am a degenerate. Now can you fuck off and stop telling me what I should do with inflated, worthless dollars?"

2021-04-22 19:11:50,wallstreetbets,"I get what your saying, but buying into MSTR is not for their BI platform as yes, that is their current business model. But this is more so of the current market situation for MSTR. They’re a derivative of the coin, and whenever coin rises, MSTR does too. Check out the 3 month graph. So many dips to take advantage of and gain 20% here and there. The real risk is when the bull market of the coin dies down."
2021-04-22 16:16:31,wallstreetbets,anything is possible in topsy-turvey world
2021-04-22 16:44:23,wallstreetbets,Short that one lol

I'm a winner, want to be on top

&#x200B;

for real, months No. ! at mentioned tickers, with a daily thread

why deny people their fun?

Yes, it was an options based sub in here: yet DFV started here too.

Then again, why didn't the modes shut it down from the beginning? Move the people to their dedicated subs ot whatever

&#x200B;

Nah, they profited from the attention, then dropped them.

2021-04-22 19:40:34,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and I was fine with that, but the next day they pinned a mod comment sending you to other subs. For GME enthusiasts and yes, the cultists, it was a low blow. 

You can give me all the shit you want, I can handle it, but for me this was a low blow to the community; it only increased the hate on both sides. Coming from an authority (mod) exactly at the right time, this is not like a prank or shitposting, and it's pretty much destroying the goodwill that made wsb and the reddit brand more valuable around the world. It was fucking stupid. If I were a reddit stakeholder I would be pissed."

It would be really funny to see, after DFV was mocked in here and then making +35M  btw, 250K people somehow hit the motherload (at their personal level of course as I don't think someone can retire with 3 shares, but who knows, strange things happen)"

It's funny, I've got someone in my DMs accusing me of removing all MVIS submissions because we're 'infiltrated by shorts', then when I go to the MVIS submissions on the top sort it's full of reports saying it's an obvious pump and that we're shills.

People want to believe things are more interesting than they really are sometimes. I dunno what to say."

2021-04-22 19:11:51,wallstreetbets,"as a long time wsber, i can speak for the mods that have been here and i fully support what you did. I sincerly thank you as well. 

Im sure its ALOT to deal with currently , but they are dying out fast. the decision you made was in the interests of the subreddits core culture and principles... and for anyone reading... this is exactly what a mod is for.

the depths of the rabbit hole these guys are down is inescapable. I advise you to watch the Q:into the storm miniseries. Its eerily similar how the gme people are acting in regards to people who picked up and follow Q. They latch on to one or two theories that have been festering in american society forever, wall street is shady, practices in shady and illegal tactics and then the fact that they could ""stick it to the man"" everything else therein after becomes conformation bias and no matter what you say,  they are right and by calling them crazy for thier thoughts, they seem more sane and they go deeper. Its played out its cycle and the people still in it are DEEP,

this isnt r/GMEstreetbets its r/wallstreetbets for all of wall street to be enjoyed and gambled on.

to all the GMEers, you have  multiple subreddits dedicated to that specific stock, why is it so important for you to be here?( ive asked this question in other comments in other places and alll i get is downvotes, NEVER a reply)

&#x200B;

keep doing you man. the best thing to do is not even engage, they have pittered out and will soon enough, engaging is only going to send them deeper down chasing alice and the mad hatter.

&#x200B;

much love even though gay"

2021-04-22 13:54:06,wallstreetbets,I‘m pretty confident! The volume is so dry that I am amazed by it! 🤓
2021-04-22 14:17:20,wallstreetbets,"Confident in the squeeze or the company, because even if you take the squeeze out of the equation gamestop is making killer moves no way its work 11B its at such an undervalued price for this company. Think about it in 2-5-10 years, how much would it be worth then, does that beat your typical year returns of 8-10% because although it might be flat everyday 364/365days, you know you wanna be in it for day 365 when they announce the ceo or outrageous earnings where the stock goes up 20-50% ytd. My opinion is hold because I believe the company is undervalued, and it has the best kind of volatility."
2021-04-22 13:58:10,wallstreetbets,Dont listen to these fucking idiots. GME is very close to launching. Protect your mctendies
2021-04-22 14:38:23,wallstreetbets,"Everytime I start losing faith I think to myself: all I can lose is what I put in (merely 10k USD), they hedgies have already lost 80 bn USD.

Also, today when the rule to have collateral is becoming effective, it's the worst time to quit"
2021-04-22 13:58:06,wallstreetbets,"I mean in a year you'll be happy as hell you held it but, there is no short-term play here unless miraculously hedgefunds decide to stop illegally manipulating the market."
2021-04-22 14:12:48,wallstreetbets,"Market is down 
So I guess it’s ok 
And as others said Volume is super low

Little worried but if falls more may be I buy more"
2021-04-22 13:53:41,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry dude, a bunch of people without  a modicum of stock or financial knowledge assured me that shares will soar to like 69,420,000."
2021-04-22 15:00:17,wallstreetbets,Shares don’t expire.
2021-04-22 16:26:26,wallstreetbets,"It  is a great asset to hold. They sell games international, have one of the most well-known labels, a loyal  fan base, no  depth, great innovative management and are moving towards a lucrative e-sport and e-commerce business model which is already showing first signs of success.

Sure, in the past, the price has been greatly skewed by the potential that people saw in a squeeze and the shrinking belief in that squeeze is what is currently pushing the price down. But there is some lower boundary at which the squeeze speculators will be all out but true value speculators won't leave so easily. You want to be around when:

* during the next years price organically grows by company value
* price explodes again, when immanent squeeze suddenly becomes more likely and all the paper hands who sold at a loss fomo back in at price peak 😉."
2021-04-22 17:09:17,wallstreetbets,"My uneducated thinking in this, is that nothing has happened the past couple months except the shorts have dug a deeper hole for themselves.  Might be wishful thinking... might be truth.  I have no idea really, but i’m not gonna give up on this company when the squeeze potential may still be there and im not gonna give up just before seeing how GME transition plays out"

So lets go"

2021-04-22 13:53:38,wallstreetbets,Putting 70k in a stock that was worth $4 a share last year. Smart ape

2021-04-22 14:58:56,wallstreetbets,They're a North American store that sells games. You're talking as if they've invented a new type of rocket fuel or something.

2021-04-22 14:55:05,wallstreetbets,Price action says the opposite. Fast upside spikes followed by longer declines are extremely bearish.
2021-04-22 17:42:46,wallstreetbets,Why would anything the HF are doing to depress price be any different a year or two years from now?  If they are getting away with it now... whats to stop them from continuing?

2021-04-22 15:52:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, with Ryan fucking Cohen coming into the picture. Selling physical copies is what they /did/ and if you think they're just gonna keep the same business model after all these changes? crazy"

2021-04-22 14:58:59,wallstreetbets,Please tell me more about the price actions of this heavily manipulated stock. Please.
2021-04-22 18:13:18,wallstreetbets,"The company hasn't actually turned around into anything tremendous yet. All the players are still being picked for team GameStop, once they actually start making moves we're more likely to see big money take positions on our side and push this thru the artificial roof shorters have created."
2021-04-22 16:31:09,wallstreetbets,"As I already said. They why didn't Ryan fucking Cohen start a new company altogether? There's zero sense in buying a failing retailer to start a company that's entirely different. Electronic Arts guys didn't buy Hasbro to build games, they founded EA. Elon Musk did not buy Pontiac to start Tesla. It's not complicated."
2021-04-22 16:27:36,wallstreetbets,"Then there's zero point in keeping anything. What's the point on taking on the debt and employees that have zero expertise in the new company? Start a new one, that's the only logical thing to do. Musk didn't buy Plymouth or Pontiac or Buick, he made his own brand."
2021-04-22 16:25:41,wallstreetbets,"If you're valuing it based on promises on the future then that's a mistake. If they start delivering on it then that's one thing. But claiming to make a Steam competitor without experience in the sector (Cohen has no game/soft. dev. experience) is a stretch. The stock market is littered with companies promising a lot of things in the future, few deliver anything, even fewer deliver exactly what they said."
2021-04-22 16:28:40,wallstreetbets,"The chart is quite obvious at this point, nothing points to manipulation at all. It might for you because I doubt you traded anything prior to this. Everything is a conspiracy when you understand nothing."
2021-04-22 19:57:32,wallstreetbets,"LOL your example with Pontiac is amazing. Elon Musk didn't start or found Tesla. He literally joined the company after buying $6.3 million of Tesla stock (during a series A investment period). He quite literally did exactly what Ryan Cohen did with GameStop.

And to see why Cohen didn't start his own company, read his letter to the board where he actually answers your question. In brief, name recognition and history."
2021-04-22 17:08:51,wallstreetbets,Did you read his letter to the board? Just asking not; trying to start an argument.
2021-04-22 17:12:55,wallstreetbets,"Why would he start a new one from the ground up, when he can just take one that's already set up. That's like saying, why would I buy a house if I can buy an empty plot and build a  brand new home"
2021-04-22 17:38:06,wallstreetbets,"LOL! Gamestop is actually in very good financial shape -- hundreds of millions in cash on-hand, the option to issue new shares, they just unloaded a pile of debt early, and so on. It's FAR easier to transform an existing company than to build one from scratch. It's FAR easier to retrain employees than find brand new ones. It's FAR easier to renovate/repurpose existing properties than to build from scratch. The list goes on and on. Companies do it all the time. You don't have any idea what you're talking about, but thanks for playing."
2021-04-22 16:27:43,wallstreetbets,"True but thats the risk I and many people are willing to take, thats the risk of the investment, if were wrong we lose small, if we are right we win big, really really big."
2021-04-22 19:54:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, his letter explains exactly why he went with GME instead of starting his own company, but I would be tremendously surprised if the dude you're replying to has done any research whatsoever other than reading bearish posts on Reddit."

2021-04-22 14:12:20,wallstreetbets,I’d wish he calls out the manipulation and fraud done by the HFs and for the SEC to do their job before proposing taxes on the wealthy. Let them pay us then let’s discuss taxes.

2021-04-22 19:03:19,wallstreetbets,I don’t believe it will be close to 40 percent. 28 at the most. It’s an over reaction and it’ll correct in a day or two
2021-04-22 14:29:04,wallstreetbets,We're about to see a blow off top. Biden saying he wants to increase capital gains on the wealthy means they'll just manipulate the market higher to make up for the tax. Bullish.
2021-04-22 17:58:06,wallstreetbets,"40% taxes on capital gain is brutal. 

Investing is still about taking a risk balancing it with the possible reward."

2021-04-22 15:37:27,wallstreetbets,Notice the culture changes and has a swath of new investors in the market actually DOING something with their money. Same year government tries to implement new taxes to get its cut
2021-04-22 15:06:41,wallstreetbets,The goals of a normal wsb user is to become the 1% eventually. Now the sub is full of normies that hate the rich. Fuck this stupid plan and this place has gone to shit

2021-04-22 19:58:29,wallstreetbets,"How does it go? No country taxed itself into prosperity. Not sure if its true but it sounds like it would be.

The focus could be on ensuring people actually pay tax and especially corporation taxes. Switch over to a PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system so there is less hassle and stress for the population at the end of the tax year and the government gets their cut monthly."
2021-04-22 17:17:59,wallstreetbets,Amazing the timing CNBC has to report news that can take down market. Ridiculous.

Great... this dumpster fire proposal will help.... fml 🤦‍♂️"

2021-04-22 13:39:00,wallstreetbets,Are you wealthy?
2021-04-22 14:37:34,wallstreetbets,"They should just tax capital gains as income (counted after payroll income), and be done with it."
2021-04-22 13:40:10,wallstreetbets,Looks like gains to me.
2021-04-22 13:43:23,wallstreetbets,Sleepy Joe come on. Why didn't he announce this on Monday when I was busy buying the dip? Market goes up then he falls asleep and suffocates the rally.
2021-04-22 16:08:23,wallstreetbets,Fuck Biden.
2021-04-22 14:47:57,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the GME saga this place is just full of r\*tards. The bad kind of. People in the comment section like ""roflmao do you earn more than 1m?"". THIS AFFECTS YOU DIRECTLY. Rich people are the ones who move the stock market. If the stock market becomes a less profitable venture for them, they will move their money elsewhere. So your 401k goes down. And your Roth IRA or whatever. **They earn more money elsewhere and you get squat.** It's like when my country was facing hyper inflation people where like ""what do I care about the price of the dollar if I don't earn in dollars?"" That's how dumb y'all sound. Like some third-world ape."

2021-04-22 14:21:42,wallstreetbets,"I am not a citizen of the U.S, but I can't believe that there are americans who are in favour of this, especially americans who invest in the stock market. Not only is this bad for the stock market performance(we will see how bad, finance industry is huge and people generally like to invest and have a steady passive income), but it also does not help the country in any way. If Biden needed money for his social programs,he should have cut the enormous government spending on unnecessary shit, not increase the already big tax burden. 
I am glad that in my country income and capital gains tax is a flat rate of 10 percent."
2021-04-22 15:46:59,wallstreetbets,"Wanna bet the insider traders knew, they sold their BeTeCe and shorted the market? That's why we saw that momentary, major dip a few days ago."
2021-04-22 15:51:51,wallstreetbets,I feel as if the wealthy already skirt around laws to lower their taxable wealth. Increasing the gains really doesn't sound profitable. For anyone.

2021-04-22 18:33:58,wallstreetbets,Honest question. Why are capital gains not taxed in brackets like normal income? I get it is to promote investing but if it was just taxed the same as normal income what else would people do with their money they were saving? Not invest it out of spite?

The fact is, things that a president does or even says, can have a dramatic affect on the market.  Today’s was a prime example.  Biden explicitly said that he wishes to double the existing capital gains tax rate:  The market didn’t like this for obvious reasons."
2021-04-22 17:05:44,wallstreetbets,I think you should allow politics as they influence entities and the taxation of investment income. At the same time we are a social bunch are we not?

im not joking, the wealthiest aren't pulling shit out of the market over this. i have some tremendously wealthy friends who currently are borrwing against their portfolios at a .03% interest rate. basically they are just given the money that is tied up in stocks to be used in other ways. with how high all their portfolios are over the last few years, selling off to ""lock in a lower capital gains tax"" would be beyond retarded, and the people who think that will happen equally so.

this is just an excuse because new sec rules come into play tomorrow and everyone wants to be in compliance."

If you don't believe me, look at how Trump's tax planned was fucking over the middle class... He sold it as a tax break, but for the ultra wealthy, and the middle class had an impending doom of a tax increase to make up for it. Sooner or later we will have to adjust our taxes and force these companies to pay their fair share as we have. There are ways to force companies to pay their fair share, our government just hasn't utilized them."

If I pull out my money once I have million is that taxed at 40%? Or is that I would have had to make 1million that same year in the stock market? 

The former can be done by pretty normal high-middle class people. If this tax targets them then long term investing for the middle class took a huge hit. Hell even 6k in the market for 30 years will make you more than a million dollars. And honestly, lower-middle class people can afford 6k so that affects them."

And for a private single person or a couple, to have a million in assets around retirement isn’t a rare thing. 

And if assets are the threshold for increased capital gains tax, it will hurt a lot of people and a shit ton of small businesses. 

Now, a million a year in GAINS.....that’s a different level all together. And THAT would make sense."

They propose raising the capital gains rate from 20% to 39.6% by taxing it as ordinary income for people with over $1m of income along with increasing corporate tax rates.

not for capital gains... different.  at 100 million, it'd be 2%, not 15%.

I'm not sure how I feel about it.  on one hand, 2 million a year sounds like a lot for someone worth 100 million... but if you have 100 million, it's really fucking easy to make 2 million.

I think I'd rather see them close the corporate loopholes and stick to increasing *income* tax on the top \~1% of earners."

2021-04-22 19:10:26,wallstreetbets,"Also before people get hung up on the $1M. This doesn't mean if you make $1M and 1 cent that your rate doubles. You only pay the higher rate at income over $1M. So if you make $2M per year. You will pay regular rate on the first mill and the doubled rate on the second mill of income.

Also I don't think this is something Biden will be able to pass. Too much corporate interests in Senate for this to pass. And even if he passes something it will be some sort of a compromise."

The money will likely be used for war rather than helping anyone. You will do better for society by researching and finding good charities to support. Also I don't feel you are entitled to force someone to part with their capital gains profits. But if you are comfortable giving, that's great, but you can't speak for everyone. And I think this policy would have a negative effect on the markets as a whole, even if the tax only effects the wealthy. This makes me sad as a non wealthy market participant."

2021-04-22 18:27:32,wallstreetbets,"“Trickle down” is a term that is often used pejoratively by most economists. Better be careful with the terminology if you’re seriously trying to sell people on it. To describe what you’re really advocating for, the phrase you are searching for is “supply side economics.” 

In any event, these policies you’re describing have already been enacted in the United States,  by multiple administrations—two presidents in particular (off the top of my head) come to mind when we recall substantially lowering taxes on the rich. Put money in the hands of the wealthy and they will innovate and share the profit, right? As it turns out, this is not the case. This is quickly demonstrable at the mere recitation of certain calendar years. “2008” alone brings to mind images of global financial knee-buckling based on inflated market conditions because of capital concentrated in the hands of the “wrong people.” The tendency to speculate and be disinterested in honest philanthropy outside politics by wealthy individuals is really easy to find examples of. If I say Starbucks doesn’t do enough with their money you’d probably be included to agree, right? This wrong-think that the rich (of any political creed!) are somehow going to share their spoils with the common folk is what baffles me. If your boss makes a million dollars, your boss made a million dollars, not you. The idea that every owner of every company will share their surplus riches with their employees and not consolidate them into even bigger money-makers like stocks and real estate is foolish, because we’d all do the exact same thing! We are on a subreddit devoted entirely to dispensing of your excess income by gambling on speculative assets! STONKS BABY!

Now, the hypothetical you describe can certainly also be true: that if we take from the rich to give to the rest, we all suffer. No question about it. But it does bring to light the core of the issue: why do these forces that push the rich to move their companies out of countries that “force them to pay their fair share” exist at all? You may think its common sense to behave that way, but I’d wager that the recompensed revenue of the proverbial owner in this case is not worth the suffering that their “common sense maneuver” has debited from the lives of others. I’d also wager that’s how a lot of regular folks who aren’t in an echo chamber of “stonks only go up diamond hands” would see it as well, and probably why people are arguing all over this post. We are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Do we continue with things as is, give the rich even more money to do with as they wish, or do we try something else? I don’t know. I’m not confident in the Biden administration not to wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing this whole thing and end up fucking everyone up, even the regular guys, but you have to understand that the proposal in and of itself is sound and better for the greater good than doing absolutely nothing.

Here are two well regarded studies—one based on 50 years of accumulated data—that clearly outline why the idea that alleviating the rich of their tax woes is not an effective growth policy:

But if you adjust for inflation (which for some reason no one does), it was like $300K or so in 1980. So you're not the plutocrat you thought you were, but everyone else around you will simultaneously treat you like one for better or for worse. Thank you for attending my TED Talk I am in no way speaking from personal experience of course, that would be crazytalk.

\*Or you could throw the $500K or so you'd have post taxes into relatively stable index funds realizing this probably isn't going to happen again, but that's no fun, is it?"

2021-04-22 16:15:17,wallstreetbets,Yellen is a complete idiot who was most likely pandering to the far left with those comments. Our entire income tax system is based on a concept called wherewithal to pay...a transaction becomes taxable when you have received the proceeds to be able to pay the tax. This is one of the reasons why our tax system is by and large a cash basis system rather than an accrual basis system. Taxes on unrealized gains would never pass muster in court.

They're leaving foreign earned income in these tax friendly countries, because if they bring those profits into the US they'd have to pay US income taxes (potentially on top of foreign taxes).

The fix is either those foreign countries become less corporate tax friendly, or the US changes how foreign earned income is taxed (either reducing those taxes in some way, or forcing companies to pay taxes on foreign income regardless of if it's brought into the US, which could get messy with international companies)."
2021-04-22 18:11:03,wallstreetbets,"Assuming it wouldn't be retroactive. You're locking in the rate by selling this year then. This is only a change to long term cap gains tax, short term is already treated as ordinary income at the federal level.

Also, fuck your government healthcare. My lifestyle is only possible because here in the US I don't get paid poverty wages for being an RN. I made ~90k in earned wages last year.

December would be a bloodbath - and people would expect december to be a bloodbath so they would withdraw earlier - game theory suggests the only way to win would be to take out everything you would have in December a lot earlier to beat everyone else to the punch.

What do I mean by optimal path? The optimal path is the most efficacious civilization design (in particular the economy), to achieve the fastest human advancement. We are light years away from that. The fact that there is such an offensively idiotic spread of wealth is literally detrimental to all human beings, including those ignorant ones with the most money (by the way, the most intelligent humans do not have the most money, they’re busy making okay money changing the world). 

If wealth were more distributed then humans would be far more advanced at this very date in time 4/22/2021. What do I mean? Imagine you’re Bill Gates but you live in 4/22/1850. You know how much better life is now? That’s due to human advancement in science and technology, and that would be far more advanced had wealth been more optimized long in the past, and kept that way. Bill Gates could be living right now, with anti-aging technology, but instead, he’ll die in 30 or so years, and all his money couldn’t help him.

taxing more to pay out more doesn't solve the actual issue. It just creates other industries dependent upon goverment funding to function.

Look at what happened to PR. Feds gave them money so Pharma companies would work there. Eventually the goverment pulled the funding and then pharma left resulting in the island getting fucked over.

This will be removed once the republican's get back in control so not only will the goverment funding be expanded but the means to fund it will be very quickly removed."

>	 Taxes on unrealized gains would never pass muster in court.

When you pay property taxes on your house each year, you’re paying taxes on an unrealized gain. Acting like these types of taxes don’t already exist is par for the sub. You don’t get to be like “yeah these taxes would never hold up in court if you just don’t talk about the taxes that already exist that work like this”. It’s a tax on an unrealized gain on an asset."

No new statement was issued by the administration and they've said they'd do it as far back as 2019, so there's no real new impetus for the fear.

IMO, it's a convenient story used as an excuse to offload assets to come into compliance with rule 15c3-3 that will supposedly start getting enforced tomorrow. Some fully paid lending programs weren't compliant with this rule and I think they were scrambling to come up with collateral to make them compliant.

https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/staff-fully-paid-lending?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery

""Rule 15c3-3(b)(3) requires broker-dealers entering into agreements with their customers who lend the broker-dealers fully-paid or excess margin securities to provide the securities lenders with collateral that fully secures the loans.[3]  Staff’s letter stated that the staff would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission regarding these programs for six months from issuance of the letter, or until April 22, 2021, to give firms time to come into compliance with the Rule.[4]"""

Why didn’t places like Kansas, who elected Sam Brownback who then used the state as a laboratory for such economic theories, become rich and full of companies?"

Nice. I bought 20 more AMC shares today. I'm holding on to all of my AMC shares. I'm not letting the hedge funds borrow my shares.

Its easy to hold when you're loosing, knowing the price HAS to squeeze sooner or later and you'll find yourself in profits. REAL DIAMOND HANDS are those holding DURING THE SQUEEZE, knowing they could call it a day, sell and take profits, but CONTINUE TO HOLD because not only 10M$/share is the floor and only THE FLOOR, but also because all of this is a war for a cause bigger than us, that we can win only by BEING COORDINATED and TRUSTING EACH OTHER. REAL DIAMOND HANDS are ready to see the price make 50% (or more) retracements from high prices such as 100k to 50k, 500k to 250k or more, WITHOUT PANICKING OR THINKING WE REACHED THE PEAK. Why? Because THE PRICE IS WRONG. We set the price. Forger your usual techincal analysis. ALL SHORTS MUST COVER. How? BY BUYING BACK FROM SELLERS, NO MATTER THE PRICE.

 Yolo plays should post the buy and sell only. So we can either see the gain or loss."

2021-04-22 14:07:51,wallstreetbets,"As someone working in Cybersecurity, this Telos Ghost thing sounds like total BS, unfortunately. Another snake oil product that companies may buy into to give them a false sense of security. I do not see any advantage of using it vs a traditional properly implemented and locked down VPN. I even could see how this turns wrong, since if you anonymize everything, how do you trace back in case of a breach? That is, if their anonymisation actually works...

They also say that in their [white paper](https://www.telos.com/wp-content/uploads/private/Telos-Ghost-Remote-Access-white-paper.pdf):

>Consumer and private citizen use of VPNs generally centers on publicly available services that improve the confidentiality for web browsing. This approach also carries significant privacy risk, especially when the public VPN provider chooses (or is forced) to enable high levels of activity logging. This can result in citizens who require privacy having their website usage, timestamps, and even entry locations exposed to authorities or hackers.

This is flawed, enterprises do not use commercial VPN solutions usually, they buy a product and install it in their own network, and the encryption is therefore between the end user and the enterprise network.

The reason most breaches occur is not because companies do not have the ""right security product"", its because they fail at basic things (i.e: implementing 2FA on external portals, Patching their stuff, etc.) Anyway, I'm not saying this stock will not pick up steam for a while, since companies are thirsty for cybersecurity magic solutions thses days, but I am saying maybe do not bet too hard on that Ghost product.

However, I really like their Xacta product. This space truly does not have many offerings for compliance automation (afaik) and it is a big part of cyber, and with more regulations popping up everywhere, it is not going anywhere.

Anyways, just wanted to chime in with some opinion from the cybersec field, I hope this may help in the DD."

2021-04-22 12:40:35,wallstreetbets,"Good DD, though I will say Telos Ghost can have so many more applications than just education. It's basically a VPN that constantly changes. Perfect for anyone with sensitive information.

My only gripe with them is their products don't seem to have as broad of a reach, industry wise, compared to Palantir for example."
2021-04-22 12:54:14,wallstreetbets,"Telos is EASILY bullish. Not many people know this company, but it's deep in the guts of Google and organizations like that."

Betting on stocks can undeniably be a risky sandbox even for grown adults to play in, so for highly impressionable kids to be getting a whiff of this or similar spaces is a very clear red flag to me.

[Chamath Palihapitiya famously warned that ""social media is ripping apart the social fabric of how society works"".](https://youtu.be/d6e1riShmak) If social media is easily warping the thoughts and opinions of adults, then kids (who are showing clear signs of being dragged into the very same maelstrom from a very young age) are all but screwed.

Its easy to hold when you're loosing, knowing the price HAS to squeeze sooner or later and you'll find yourself in profits. REAL DIAMOND HANDS are those holding DURING THE SQUEEZE, knowing they could call it a day, sell and take profits, but CONTINUE TO HOLD because not only 10M$/share is the floor and only THE FLOOR, but also because all of this is a war for a cause bigger than us, that we can win only by BEING COORDINATED and TRUSTING EACH OTHER. REAL DIAMOND HANDS are ready to see the price make 50% (or more) retracements from high prices such as 100k to 50k, 500k to 250k or more, WITHOUT PANICKING OR THINKING WE REACHED THE PEAK. Why? Because THE PRICE IS WRONG. We set the price. Forger your usual techincal analysis. ALL SHORTS MUST COVER. How? BY BUYING BACK FROM SELLERS, NO MATTER THE PRICE. 

Hold the fucking line. The hardest past IS NOT DONE YET, DON'T FUCKING DANCE. FLOOR IS 10M$. Apes are strong, but only together. Let's stay together."

2021-04-22 12:13:02,wallstreetbets,"I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a giga-chad son. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a boy for at least 18 years solely so he can go and ravage another woman. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little boy - reading him stories at bedtime, making him go to technical analysis practice, making sure he had a healthy diet, educating him in memes, drawing with him. All of it has one simple result: his allowance is more enjoyable for the men who's wives he will eventually fuck in every hole.

Raised the perfect boy? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way he grew up, who marries his side girl. He gets to watch the boy fuck his wife's tight bussy every night. He gets the benefits of your boy's kind and sweet allowance that came from the way you raised him.

As a mom who has a son, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your ALLOWANCE simply to raise a boy to pay another man's allowance. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically"

2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TTCF Tattooed Chef, a plant based food brand. The next Beyond Meat 🚀🚀🚀 Fellow rocket ship enthusiasts, I present to you a Due Diligence developed by yours truly, [u/yoloallinbro](https://www.reddit.com/u/yoloallinbro/), borrower of NINJA loans.

Tattooed Chef is a plant-based food brand. They have vertically integrated manufacturing and are available in stores like Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam's Club. TLDR is below.

**Fundamentals:**

* 2021 expected revenue is $222m, expected net income is $2.5m-$5m
* 2020 revenue was $148.5m, net income was $41.5m (I think \~$40m was one time tax deduction)
* 2019 revenue was $84.9m, net income was $2.2m
* Current market cap is $1.34b
* Merged with SPAC $FMCI in October 2020.
* It's shorted to oblivion according to finviz, fintel, and iborrowdesk. 30% short float.
* 2021 Q1 earnings expected to report around May 8th.
* Insiders own a total of 48% of the company.
   * Recently, an insider director bought 250k shares on April 15th.

**Qualitative notes:**

* CEO Salvatore ""Sam"" Galletti is the founder of the company. He's worked in the food business for 35 years. It started off as a private family business. He was approached to go public via SPAC and took the opportunity because of massive capital injection to build out Tattooed Chef, the brand.
* Tattooed Chef is a new brand that the company started working on in 2017. Before this brand, they were only private label providers to stores like Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. They still operate these private label customer accounts alongside the Tattooed Chef brand.
* The company is entirely vertically integrated (namely, its manufacturing).
* His daughter, Sarah Galletti, is the Chief Creative Officer of Tattooed Chef. Her job is to design new products. The CEO said her core strength is getting designs out quickly and that is complementary with the company's vertically integrated manufacturing so that they can get the product out from design quickly.
* They've spent like 0 dollars on advertising. They developed a plan to hit 2 billion impressions in the form of 6 and 16 second videos in the first 8 months of 2021. This is the first time they're spending advertising dollars.
   * Small nuance: they spent dollars on product demos in Sam's Club. But that is negligible spend.
* They have 11 SKUs in Walmart, in over 2000 of their super centers. They started off in Sam's Club. They also have SKUs in Costco. They were given an opportunity to have 2 SKUs in Target, and recently in March 2021 they got approved for 6 SKUs.
   * The way the food business works in regards to shelf space is, the stores want to shelve products that actually sell. They have to meet sells-per-week requirements. They started off with smaller SKU allocation in Walmart and Target and after proving their products they've grown to the SKU numbers they have now. That's a very good sign.
* Twitter and Discord groups like Jeremy Lefebvre and Dumb Money post pictures of local Target frozen shelves being out of TTCF stock. Search Twitter for $TTCF and you'll see them. Also the comments on TTCF's official twitter account have stuff like ""yo get the product in my target please, it's always out of stock"" and ""when you gonna be in europe please"".
   * Youtuber Jeremy Lefebvre DM'd the TTCF instagram account asking something like ""hey is this a production issue on your end or what? my target is always empty"" and they replied saying something like ""nah bro we just selling hella haha"". Very good sign.
* A common conception is TTCF only produces frozen products. That is not true. They're already working on ambient products, designed by Sarah. The CEO said an interview in December that they should have their first ambient product out in 60-90 days (so sometime Q2 2021).
   * Note that they're not an ambient manufacturer, so they'll have to work with a co-packer. This is like their first dependency outside of their vertically integrated manufacturing.
* 2021 is about aggressively growing the TTCF brand and focusing on revenue. Before, the CEO ran the private business while always thinking about profitability. As a result, they've developed contribution margin quotas for each product they produce in their internal manufacturing. But now with SPAC capital injection, he can focus on growing the TTCF brand and get it into retail stores.
   * Before 2021, their only sales was the CEO and his daughter. Now, they've hired marketing teams to get them into more retail stores, namely an ex-Coca Cola national sales manager.
* Looking forward, Europe has a strong demand for their products as well, as plant-based proteins are growing in affinity. TTCF has 2 manufacturing plants, one in California and one in Italy. It's cheaper for them to ship ingredients from Italy to the US for their US operations. So they're looking to hire sales in Europe to get TTCF in stores there. According to their twitter, they're already in Costco UK.

**Competitive edges:**

* Most food brands in this space are not profitable -- they burn a ton of marketing dollars while their manufacturing costs are high. This isn't a problem for TTCF because they've built manufacturing infrastructure for themselves since 2010.
* The CEO views competition in the space as competing for shelf space. That comes down to having unique products. He says having Sarah as a creative and fast designer is a key edge to this.
* Vertically integrated manufacturing.

**Risks:**

* It's basically a startup building a brand but with a profitable base of proven internal manufacturing as it was used for private labeling and a strong balance sheet. With building a brand comes all sorts of scaling challenges -- capital allocation for marketing spend, hiring employees to do sales, operating in new stores, etc. So they'll run into a bunch of growing pains. But I can't think of anything major. And also it doesn't look like they'll need to do share offering any time soon to raise money, so that's good.
* Environmental conditions or macro conditions causes their ingredient chain to be more costly, reducing margins. I haven't dug into whether they're affected by commodity inflation yet, but because they own manufacturing I don't think it's a potentially big problem for them.
* The company's history is honestly difficult to follow. They were like 2 different names before Tattooed Chef. An infographic kinda solves the problem tho, linked in sources below. And also people think it's only a frozen food brand, but they're actually working on ambient food too.
* Recent news of the CFO leaving and a stock sell by the CEO give bad optics. But I think the headlines of these events make it seem way scarier than it actually is. The sale by CEO was planned.

**News Clarifications:**

* The CEO selling shares was to pay off debt.

[Source: https:\/\/docoh.com\/filing\/1821515\/0001213900-21-021925\/SC13DA](https://preview.redd.it/7e2pfzrursu61.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=86651dcfccb619226a2e580624964ec25b2d3c8e)

**TLDR:**

* It looks super good on paper -- 50% YoY revenue growth, they're profitable, and only now they're tapping into advertising.
* In the CEO interview, he said ""focus on aggressive growth"" like a bajillion times for 2021. Its 2021 revenue estimate of $222m only includes current accounts of Sam's Club, Costco, Walmart, and Target. So given new accounts will happen, this revenue estimate is conservative.
* And given the recent SPAC sell off, I think now's a great entry point.
* Market cap is 1.36B, that's a 7.4 forward PS. Beyond Meat $BYND has 2021 expected revenue $630m, and trades at a 13.6 forward PS (Market cap of BYND is $8.44B). The comp just makes it seem like an extremely asymmetric bet.
   * If it trades at BYND's forward PS for 2021, then the share price would be \~$36.
   * My math for that is: 13.6 \* $222m = 3b, share price at 3b would be \~$36.
   * But I personally think the revenue growth projections are very conservative, because the CEO said it only includes existing accounts, which is those 4 stores. Their 2021 aggro growth plan is to push into more retail stores.
* I tried their food too, bought it at a local Target, it's pretty good for a frozen meal and as a meat eater I can see the appeal.
* Obligatory rockets: 🚀🚀🚀

**Position:**

* 10,000 shares at $16.

2021-04-22 15:57:49,wallstreetbets,"The numbers seem good but its worth noting THIS IS NOT MEAT REPLACEMENT. It's like veggie bowls and granola and some buffalo coli-flower. The barrier to entry on these products is low and could easily be sniped by store brands like Target's Good and Gather.

If they can get good brand recognition and repeat buyers there's potential but I don't think it's a sure fire rip."

I don't really shop at the stores listed above so this is the first time I've heard of the product.  I always try the plant-based foods when I see new ones, Beyond Meat is by far the best I've tried."

Most of it is just terrible frozen vegetable foods. If you're trying to invest in plant based foods I would recommend Conagra's Gardein brand. 

TTCF It is no where near the level of innovation that Gardein, Impossible, or Beyond is at."
2021-04-22 15:09:59,wallstreetbets,Overpriced frozen veggies?  no thanks
2021-04-22 16:20:48,wallstreetbets,Don’t know if mentioned but an insider to the company also just bought more stocks yesterday or Wednesday if I’m not mistaken
2021-04-22 16:36:32,wallstreetbets,"Bear case:
       Their supply chain and ability to scale is being tested, so far its not going great to say the least. The space is getting crowded and as you touched on, margins are dwindling. This sector is a race to the bottom in terms of who can offer the lowest price. 
              If chicken or beef for instance drops significantly in price due to logistics being smoother post covid, then the company is in even more trouble  But thats not even their core lane/competition. Their are an insane amount of alternatives to their products, and so far nothing is pointing to them being any kind of leader in this space."
2021-04-22 19:28:31,wallstreetbets,"I didnt see where you mentioned they do everything in house so far. They grow thier own plants, the largest cauliflower producer in Italy i believe. They manufacture themselves. I think this is a key reason they are able to inovate so quickly."

2021-04-22 17:42:50,wallstreetbets,"It's a weird market. It's getting saturated for vegetarians, so the growth is in converting traditional people. This is not the branding to get those people."
2021-04-22 18:55:58,wallstreetbets,I played this a lot as a SPAC.  Made a few hundred.  It’s a solid long play but I put my money into DKNG instead as in know that will take off sooner
2021-04-22 19:26:30,wallstreetbets,"""2021 expected revenue is $222m, expected net income is $2.5m-$5m""...so they net close to 2%? LOL

I played this as a SPAC and later during its Analyst Day. I feel like they have to focus on more innovative products, like their plant based pepperoni pizza. Hopefully you make some money but I wont buy for a while.  


Also is there any truth about the CFO stepping down?"

2021-04-22 15:48:54,wallstreetbets,"Moving the population away from meat isn't ""hipster bullshit"".  That's a very uninformed analysis. It only has room to grow.

Even the largest meat producers disagree with your assessment and have put out meat alternatives (Tyson, Perdue, Hormel, among others).

https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/tackling-worlds-most-urgent-problem-meat

Nobody needs meat alternatives to stop eating meat, but people are accustomed to that sort of food. 

>Before this brand, they were only private label providers to stores like Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. They still operate these private label customer accounts alongside the Tattooed Chef brand.

I always buy the Trader Joe's Protein Patties. The texture is similar to Beyond/Impossible. I turn them into quick kabobs on a grill pan.  It sounds like maybe Tattooed Chef makes them."

2021-04-22 15:49:54,wallstreetbets,"> Most of it is just terrible frozen vegetable foods. If you're trying to invest in plant based foods I would recommend Conagra's Gardein brand.

 Bro no one wants to invest into a stock that's basically at the same price point it was 6 years ago and it's only been stagnating since then. It barely grew by 30% since 1997.

 Tattooed Chef has good potential to double, triple or quadruple its shares in a smaller amount of time considering its current market cap and fast growth.

 And numbers don't lie for TTCF, they're quite quickly growing and improving their revenue year by year."
2021-04-22 16:46:18,wallstreetbets,So because you're some pompous vegetarian you know everything.. have you tried any of their products just wondering
2021-04-22 19:05:38,wallstreetbets,I respectfully disagree. I suspect the sell through rate for TTCF products are pretty dang high judging from those Walmart/Costco photos that people upload. There are definitely ample demand for their products regardless of whether you are their target demographic. I’m not a big holder (only 600shares @ 18.5) but I’m excited abt the future of this company
2021-04-22 16:30:54,wallstreetbets,"http://openinsider.com/ttcf

correct, a director bought 250k shares for $2.5m ($10 each because something about the SPAC merger)"
2021-04-22 19:35:05,wallstreetbets,"yea that's all correct. CEO mentioned this in his interview in December 2020. also he mentioned that it's still cheaper to produce and manufacture in italy and ship it to the US than it is to get it in the US directly.

so yeah i think it's key to their innovative speed"
2021-04-22 15:43:42,wallstreetbets,Who tf gave platinum for that?
2021-04-22 15:10:00,wallstreetbets,Yikes.
2021-04-22 15:11:33,wallstreetbets,You've never heard of this brand because you walk past it all the time. It's frozen vegetables with some decoration. Basically no non-vegan would consider it and vegans have higher standards in the products they look for.
2021-04-22 16:05:52,wallstreetbets,This is like the guy who hated apple products 10 years ago and couldn’t possibly imagine anyone else buying an iPod or iPhone.
2021-04-22 14:24:25,wallstreetbets,"As a meat-eater, you are completely missing the point. Just because you like meat doesn't mean plant-based diets arent becoming increasingly popular. And the way things are going that trend will not reverse."
2021-04-22 14:57:13,wallstreetbets,Stfu short bear
2021-04-22 15:00:01,wallstreetbets,Single people who don't want to make a huge mess for one person and is a vegetarian. Not hard to think of other people's status.
2021-04-22 16:16:23,wallstreetbets,"why very good food company? their valuation is very rich already, which is why i didn’t want to bite."
2021-04-22 16:15:03,wallstreetbets,ah i should edit this. i found out that it’s because of a one-time tax deduction from a company restructure. something about changing into a C corp.
2021-04-22 16:47:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah
2021-04-22 19:37:49,wallstreetbets,"i think it's worth noting because they're netting positive.

most businesses bleed money when they're growing revenues. they did 75% increase from 2019 to 2020 revenue and were net income positive. i think that's impressive.

they're now investing aggressively in growth in 2021, focusing on gross revenue. so that net income figure will for sure be lower."
2021-04-22 15:00:15,wallstreetbets,Goog thing nobody asked you!
2021-04-22 17:16:03,wallstreetbets,"are you talking about this twitter thread from Upslope Capital? [https://twitter.com/UpslopeCapital](https://twitter.com/UpslopeCapital)

i get why it seems shady with the CFO leaving and then CEO is selling shares... but i personally am okay with giving the benefit of the doubt here in that it's growing pains from SPACing a private, family run business into a public company. it could be for many reasonable reasons, such as cleaning up the cap table.

and the selling of shares has also been debunked that it's not because the CEO lost faith in the company, and that it was a planned sale.

i got this info from this youtube video that explains it well (i've no affiliation with this guy, i just use youtube for research): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tymO5bINH4&ab\_channel=ThePopularInvestor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tymO5bINH4&ab_channel=ThePopularInvestor)"
2021-04-22 13:34:01,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-22 16:41:13,wallstreetbets,Uhhh because..?
2021-04-22 15:09:15,wallstreetbets,"Also decade long on plant based. I would never buy TTCF if I saw it in a store. It's literally just frozen vegetables with expensive packaging. People that think this is a good plant based play are kidding themselves.

I bet you buy Gardein too? I do."
2021-04-22 16:42:55,wallstreetbets,It is good
2021-04-22 18:12:49,wallstreetbets,"Amy's is pretty exclusively single-serving meals, Tattooed Chef has more in line with side dishes for meals for two."
2021-04-22 12:50:48,wallstreetbets,What is SKU’s ?? :0
2021-04-22 16:00:05,wallstreetbets,the product isn't inherently hipster bullshit but the branding on this is. I think the barrier to entry on products like this is low and would be easy for walmart or target to replicate in-house so customer retention and brand recognition will be must-haves for this company.
2021-04-22 17:04:22,wallstreetbets,"""Tattooed chef"" as a name and the aesthetic they are encapsulating is totally trendy hipster bullshit lmao. Give me a better analysis of why they chose that name, their logo, How they present themselves, etc."
2021-04-22 16:29:43,wallstreetbets,Turnover doesn’t mean shit though at the end of the day. They made $2-5m profit and valued at over a billion. Utterly ridiculous no wonder they are shorted to the moon.
2021-04-22 16:57:02,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't waste my money on overpriced frozen foods. What makes me pompous? I don't give a shit about what you eat.
2021-04-22 19:44:51,wallstreetbets,"Dude, sell and save your money. You've been marketed."
2021-04-22 16:35:11,wallstreetbets,"Whoever paid for this post

I'm pretty sure there was a big post about this company the other day where the CEO himself liquidated a shitload of stocks"
2021-04-22 16:44:57,wallstreetbets,You're just a straight hater. Why you have such strong conviction to talk shit on it
2021-04-22 16:33:27,wallstreetbets,"Lol...I was and am still that guy. Hate me. Lol
Stretch of a comparison but hey. 
Where's the iPod now anyways? I guess apple agrees no one wanted it."
2021-04-22 14:42:13,wallstreetbets,We either like the stonk or we don't. As a investment vessel..sure. As something I like...no. I put my money in things I like to make sure they stick around.
2021-04-22 15:48:07,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-22 16:57:13,wallstreetbets,I’m extremely new at stocks but it was because they are from my local area and kind of dumb to say in a forum full of analysts but I just intuitively believe in them. I haven’t analyzed their numbers. They recently opened a new production facility in Vancouver and are apparently trying to expand into the states. They are really big here locally so hopefully it works out
2021-04-22 19:46:08,wallstreetbets,"i love their YOY growth, but I'm concerned about their pricing + competing with big names like Green Giant for frozen vegetables.  


 I also really think they should pay more attention to meat subsitutes (I havent tried their plant based sausage bowl nor their plant based pepperoni pizzzzz)"
2021-04-22 18:15:13,wallstreetbets,"The yt guy sounds like he's super long ttcf. He's not making a connection btw fco resigning and ceo selling shares.

It's on descending channel from 28 from Jan and if not reversed, it can meet 12.5-14. Good earnings did not stop the descend."
2021-04-22 14:06:35,wallstreetbets,This is dumb. If it were 1or 2 dollars a share it would give this company a valuation of less than 100 to 200 million. They have more than that in cash on the balance sheet. If it were that cheap I would immediately liquidate everything to buy.
2021-04-22 19:21:49,wallstreetbets,"Fair point, have a nice day"
2021-04-22 16:48:44,wallstreetbets,Checks out
2021-04-22 16:30:44,wallstreetbets,Uhhh do you even know other humans? Look at peloton. It’s a bike with an iPad and expensive packaging. You’re argument is dumb. Marketing is half aesthetics if not more
2021-04-22 18:18:54,wallstreetbets,"Hold on a minute, what's wrong with gardein turkey cutlets man?"
2021-04-22 18:15:24,wallstreetbets,"People who are actually plant based aren't buying anything in the frozen section at walmart and target. It's people who ""want to be healthy"" and equate plant-based-meat-substitute with healthy, see it as they pass by, and grab one to try"
2021-04-22 19:28:17,wallstreetbets,"many of their products are simply frozen veggies (and in my opinion overpriced)), but if they focus on innovative products like their plant based pepperoni, I could see bigger potential."
2021-04-22 16:42:23,wallstreetbets,So you have never tried it?
2021-04-22 13:20:25,wallstreetbets,It's like an inventory number. Look at the tags on the shelves next time you go shopping. It'll say SKU:xxxxxx somewhere. Having multiple SKUs in a store just means having multiple different products on the shelves.
2021-04-22 12:59:16,wallstreetbets,If you can't use Google you shouldn't be anywhere near the stock market
2021-04-22 16:13:56,wallstreetbets,SKU stands for stock keeping unit.  Every variation of a product is a different SKU.  Suppose you have four different colors of the same shirt.  That is four SKUs.
2021-04-22 16:55:41,wallstreetbets,"Beyond and Impossible set a very high standard for brand recognition and media attention. Before them, Just (FKA Hampton Creek), famous for the Just Egg and  of course, the mayo that put fear in the heart of [Hellman's](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/12/18/how-little-just-mayo-took-on-big-egg-and-won/) and [the egg industry](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-egg-board-investigation-20161007-snap-story.html). Daiya is pretty well-known, but hasn't been in the news as frequently. Their cheesecakes and pizzas and burritos are in many chain supermarkets. ETA: and of course, their cheeses.

I  agree that the branding won't appeal to as general a population as Beyond/Impossible, especially with the fragile masculinity issue that Beyond and Impossible do well to break for men after lifetimes of corporate indoctrination that wheeling oneself to the meat section of Walmart and picking animal flesh has something to do with being ""manly"". It isn't just Beyond and Impossible that have seen sales growth, though; all the attention has pushed sales up for the whole sector, significantly more than the small bump in meat sales after covid hit.

As for replicating in-house, I think you mean private-labeling. Ketchup, beans, and hundreds of other products have generic/private-label versions, and many buy them. But they also buy the brand versions because they assume it's better, even when it's not. Trader Joe's has the private-labeled foods but even they sell Beyond Burgers and Impossible.

It'll come down to their marketing and competitive pricing. Since they supply some of Trader Joe's alternatives, I don't doubt the quality and taste, since I've had probably all of them and they're great."
2021-04-22 17:25:03,wallstreetbets,"The branding is hipstery, I'll give you that. But there are similar products in supermarket chains. Looking at their site, I immediately thought of those Cali'flour pizzas I always see. There are brands that really capitalize on that sort of imaging successfully, like kombucha brands (Kevita was even bought by Pepsi). Also, Sweet Earth is in many chain supermarkets and their name and the logo of a farmer in a yoga pose are comparable.

The biggest problem I see with this company is that it's not vegan. It's another brand trying to play both sides, so they're already sacrificing brand loyalty with a segment of the population they should be trying to nab as loyal customers: vegans and plant-based dieters. This is to try instead to appeal to the ovo-lacto vegetarian crowd. 

Vegetarians will eat vegan food, but vegans won't eat eggs and dairy. Morningstar Farms (of Kellogg's) saw the problem with this. [They said they're going vegan by 2021](https://www.fastcompany.com/90314319/kellogg-owned-morningstar-farms-is-going-full-vegan-by-2021) but they've failed that timeline."
2021-04-22 16:33:58,wallstreetbets,"2-5 million profit is definitely not bad for a growing company. Companies like Spotify, Uber, Airbnb, Snap and many others still haven't had a single profitable year."
2021-04-22 17:10:30,wallstreetbets,You can't say anything until you have tried it. What you say doesn't mean anything
2021-04-22 16:55:38,wallstreetbets,Because it's a terrible product that investors are trying to be too clever about.
2021-04-22 15:06:29,wallstreetbets,Some people need a vegetarian diet. Can’t blame them for wanting some form of imitation.
2021-04-22 17:03:07,wallstreetbets,sounds like social arbitrage investing to me :P sound way to go about it!
2021-04-22 14:39:31,wallstreetbets,Some people only see share price.
2021-04-22 16:37:13,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure how Peloton and the incentives behind Peloton are relevant to a conversation about packaged frozen vegetables.
2021-04-22 18:22:37,wallstreetbets,"THEYRE MY FAVORITEEEEE. But I mean actual customers buy stuff like Gardein, not TTCF."
2021-04-22 18:18:19,wallstreetbets,It's not even plant based dude... Half of their SKUs have dairy in it LOL
2021-04-22 16:54:30,wallstreetbets,Why would I waste my money?
2021-04-22 14:28:37,wallstreetbets,Thanks man :)
2021-04-22 15:31:07,wallstreetbets,"They got someone else to do unpaid labor for them just by asking.

Reduction of overhead just by asking.

That's CEO material!"
2021-04-22 18:11:24,wallstreetbets,"oh fuck ur right now i gotta stop eating Beyond Meat

I did forget about them supplying TJoes that's a big plus."
2021-04-22 19:11:42,wallstreetbets,"You make a lot of very good points here, like bravo for doing some good supporting research on that. I agree with the sentiment about vegetarian/vegan. Having many people in my life with dietary restrictions (I'm not, thankfully) I know they default to brands that are marked vegan because they know it's going to work for them by default.

I don't think this company will do awful, but I also don't think it's an amazing investment opportunity."
2021-04-22 16:40:01,wallstreetbets,"Diminishing returns. You're basically saying we should invest in the distribution channels like Costco and Target since they can sell garbage like TTCF enough to last a few years.

TTCF will be off the shelves before 2024. You can save this comment. It's a nothingburger."
2021-04-22 17:12:38,wallstreetbets,Ya ok sure. Good luck with your fancy frozen vegetable investment
2021-04-22 16:48:19,wallstreetbets,"He's making the point that people don't shop rationally. A better example would be bottled water or designer clothes.

I can guarantee you're in the minority regarding expensive packaging. You're right it's crap but most people don't think that way. They see expensive packaging, they think quality product."
2021-04-22 18:03:57,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, homey if nothing else so you can chime in on this wsb thread without sounding like a reeree."
2021-04-22 18:13:46,wallstreetbets,Maybe there was a misunderstanding. What did I say that made you want to stop eating Beyond?
2021-04-22 16:42:47,wallstreetbets,"Ok let's see, I'd rather put money into higher risk stock like TTCF hoping stock triples (or more) itself in 1-2 years which is a decent possibility than invest into a stock that barely moved since 1997. I'd rather put money into bonds than into a company that is stagnating for 25 years hoping for 15% return in 5 years lol."
2021-04-22 17:19:45,wallstreetbets,Lol. Act like it's going to break me. I have 100 shares. I'm just saying you can't say all that and never have even tried it or anything
2021-04-22 17:20:39,wallstreetbets,That's exactly like the peloton comment before with the other person. Fancy vegetables? Fancy fucking bike with an iPad.
2021-04-22 17:03:04,wallstreetbets,Exactly. And Peloton has very similar competitors that offer the same or better at lower cost but in less trendy formats or expensive subscriptions but they have massive market share. Just trying to use a recently relevant example
2021-04-22 17:00:21,wallstreetbets,"Ya I don't really expect people to buy TTCF as repeat customers like they do with bottled water. Run the experiment yourself, go get TTCF, Gardein, beyond, and impossible and ask yourself which one you would buy as a repeat costumer.

It's just common sense. TTCF offers no differentiation in plant based markets at all."
2021-04-22 18:14:34,wallstreetbets,"Nahhh I think I've lived a plant based life long enough to know what's complete garbage and what isn't. Best SKU they have is cauliflower wings but that isn't much different than the rest of their frozen vegetable with a little bit of garnish lineup.

I just wouldn't compare it to Gardein, daiya, impossible, or beyond at all, not even close to the same school of products."
2021-04-22 16:54:43,wallstreetbets,Ok. Losing money isn't a possibility right?
2021-04-22 18:16:43,wallstreetbets,"The thing is that Peloton isn't pretending to be something  like a full fledged gym.


TTCF is just fucking frozen vegetable plates that people are branding as plant based foods. It's clear the people have no idea about the plant based market at all. 

Its not even plant based when their products dump shitty CHEESE on the products. Beyond, daiya, Gardein, and impossible are actually plant-based derivatives."
2021-04-22 17:18:37,wallstreetbets,"Well it is, I meant I'd rather lose all my money on stock like TTCF hoping stock moons which is a possibility, then invest into some boring boomer stock for which you'd hope to gain like 10% in 5 years, but it's less riskier investment."
2021-04-22 18:35:39,wallstreetbets,Hmmmm. I see where you're coming from but I don't think it's as bad as you're making out
2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"All in AI calls, lets hit that 120 💎🤚🏼 "

2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I ordered a Fisker FSR great play, lying GS DOOSH Analyst $10 PT when BOA $31 LOL these guys are educated? DD  

Balls deep in FSR I just sold 10 $13.50 4/30 puts 1800 shares, 1 $15.00 put expire tomorrow. bought $14.50 4/23 calls super cheap expiring tomorrow too. Going on the website now to order a FISKER OCEAN $250.00 deposit. Nice looking car perfect around town EV , dare i say nicer look then TESLA.

Here is my dummy DD :

PART 1 :

Fisker commisioned MAGMA to build the cars, they have the factory turning out beautys like the Toyota Supra this will get them up and running fast. ( RIDE dropped like a billy on a factory and they still fked) I think using MAGMA is the right way to scale this business.

They can buy a factory later when they have ELON money.

Part 2:

OCEAN 1 with biden tax credits may come in under 30k, thats the sweet spot. ( I think that other high end EV  has tough competition with Mercedes in the Rich people sector) for 30k i think the FISKER OCEAN 1 may become the peoples EV and many's first.

Part 3:

FOXCONN coming up and Henrik is excited and ready to reveal some new stuff maybe another model?? Large full size SUV would knock it out of the park.

Lots to look forward to here. Just my Humble Opinion.

Goldman BallSacks Analyst put a $10 PT on this today after yesterdays epic run up. I think sleezy GS and their buddies are stuck in a short play and have lots of calls sold expiring this week.

Anyway i think it can be the next TESLA my shares are for the long run, anyone else here support FSR?"
2021-04-22 11:04:44,wallstreetbets,Hopefully this DD stays I tried before and mentioned another New EV as competition which is still under their reverse merger name and that got taken down ( i didnt see that rule) I tried to clean it up. Hoping to just get a chance to voice my opinion here lol. Love the community but making posts on Reddit is damn near impossible in some of these communities.
2021-04-22 11:04:06,wallstreetbets,Goldman talks its on book.  Nuff said.
2021-04-22 14:52:12,wallstreetbets,"This DD is crafted with the same crayons used to design the cars.  Fisker draws pretty cars, checkered history of execution.  Final specs on Ocean still not released.  Big brag that months after opening for preorders April 15th, they finally reached 15,000 reservations \*yawn\*, profit projections are based on 200K+/year sold.

News today, he's begging for more EV credits, guess they need more government money in order to sell their cars.

The company is spelled Magna with an N.  Magma comes from volcanos, chart looks like a volcano, magma running down the sides is going to roll over your puts.  Good luck!"
2021-04-22 12:18:50,wallstreetbets,#hope you're also long preparation H
2021-04-22 15:57:14,wallstreetbets,MAGNA
2021-04-22 16:19:58,wallstreetbets,"It might be worth mentioning that **Magna ($MGA)** is building for them not Magma.

Just in case there is confusion if someone is trying to research the partnership."
2021-04-22 17:18:06,wallstreetbets," ( Anyway i think it can be the next TESLA my shares are for the long run, anyone else here support FSR? )

Please explain how they compare to Tesla.  Tesla didn't source their cars, they actually built it in house!

That same rebate you can use on the Ocean 1, you can use on any other EV.  I can also get a Tesla for under 30k.

As pointed out in other post Tesla knocked down barriers and reinvented a lot of the production process for their car manufacturing.  I remember a good read about the mechanical arms moving so fast their engineers had to factor in wind drag against them.

Tesla runs into an issue their engineers are sleeping on production floors with Elon until the shit is hammered out.  FSR just gonna call 1-800-ZERO-Engineering.  Or they'll reached out to [NothingMade@InHouse.com](mailto:NothingMade@InHouse.com).

This will be a slow burn.  Unless another company comes along with no DD and snatches them up like GM did with Nikola its a losing position IMO!"

2021-04-22 11:21:31,wallstreetbets,I just sold those options for tomorrow for double what i paid for them when it creeped over $14.50 for a moment.  never planned to hold those. made good return % wise on them but only had a few since like you said super risky.
2021-04-22 11:31:04,wallstreetbets,If Goldman is holding a large inventory of an asset and wants to unload it they will talk it up hoping to sell it to some other idiots.  Be very skeptical when GS talks a specific asset.  Somewhat less skeptical when the talk the broad market.   And for the love of god do your own research to confirm or reject anything Goldman says.
2021-04-22 11:48:00,wallstreetbets,I saw the post was from less than an hour ago so I thought you bought them at the peak
2021-04-22 11:35:45,wallstreetbets,SO they are confirmed Snakes. SO if they are talking this down they must be trying to bring it down so they can load up cheap shares for their buddies.
2021-04-22 12:03:22,wallstreetbets,I tried to snapshot my proof from schwab. Bought just 3 ( total cost around $50 and sold them like 15 minutes later for $150.00  LOL wish io had the big balls to buy a ton of them but like you said super duper risky.
2021-04-22 17:54:18,wallstreetbets,No if they are holding a large amount of this stock they would want to **talk it up** not talk it down. That way more people come flocking to take all their baggage. I'd assume they would release a short seller report on the company if they wanted to talk it down

2021-04-22 12:22:14,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah to this. I know too many people who always wait for a dip to come in before buying versus DCAing. I’m long Tesla and am still DCA with a share a month. Also have a 1550 Mar 17 2023 leap because why the hell not. It’s always best to keep buying Tesla shares over the long term and ignore the noise.
2021-04-22 10:55:07,wallstreetbets,"Sell CCs along the way to make money!

Regarding tsla advantage in the market — they’ll continue to grow and make more factories as necessary. They’ve proven they can make factories quickly.  

Can’t say “writing is on the wall because US is pushing EVs so other companies will jump in” because the obv counter to that is the market for EVs will grow so there will be growth available for everyone.  

Biggest concern imho is the rise of Chinese EV manufacturers.  China is turning the tide as their market begins to support and favor local companies more (yes their gov has done this for decades but the buying public has not).  And with China being far far FAR more important than EU or US combined - this is much more of a factor than anything I’ve seen mentioned.   
That being said tsla is in a great position to overcome the mentioned challenges.

2021-04-22 13:47:31,wallstreetbets,"TSLA gonna crash, they got the worst PR nightmare imaginable now... As if having 2 trapped occupants burned alive inside the vehicle was t bad enough...

I was thinking about it and if they find any evidence AP was on, or even that someone was behind the wheel - people are gonna remember this for a while

The fact that police (somehow) got warrants immediately, is concerning and super dramatic/ over-the-top (someone involved clearly has an axe to grind with Tesla... When do you see judge's ordering warrants for Ford, Dodge, Volvo, Honda or Toyota?)

Any announcements are going to scrutinized, and the statements impacts will be magnified. If they find AP was active somehow, it's going to shake everyone's confidence in Tesla and their most valuable technology. Not to mention, news outlets are all focusing on the fact that Tesla batteries can ignite on severe impact. Something weird is happening here, that's for sure."

2021-04-22 09:55:35,wallstreetbets,"Lol...

Peter Rawlinson is a great guy, but he has yet to bring a vehicle to mass production. By the time they start rolling out the Air (if ever), Tesla will be putting out the Model S/X with the 4680 cells and single casts. The efficiency advantage Lucid claims will be long gone already.

I wonder why people just don't get it, the lead Tesla has is huge. They also have Elon Musk, who gets impossible things to happen."
2021-04-22 14:57:29,wallstreetbets,"☕️ I will patiently await the outcome of this...

...in the mean time I'm going to increase my strategic reserves of popcorn."
2021-04-22 10:06:00,wallstreetbets,"Others claim, Tesla delivers."
2021-04-22 10:00:26,wallstreetbets,"I mean the factory is already done and cars are expected to be rolling out of the factory by end of summer (I personally think they’ll delay again). Lucid is already using single casts. I think they won’t even be competitors, at least initially though. Lucid aims up market, customers who won’t put up with Tesla build quality. 

My statement is more an allusion to the coming market of electric cars. Someone who drives VW is more likely to buy the ID.4 than a Tesla. Ford fans are more likely to buy Mach E, Chevy buyers will pick the Hummer over the Cybertruck. That isn’t to say that those cars are better than Tesla, but to assume that Tesla’s market dominance in automotive sales will continue to double YoY is naive IMO."
2021-04-22 10:13:21,wallstreetbets,"I don’t disagree, Tesla has had an amazing market advantage, and for that, legacy car makers have and will continue to pay for it. But the writing is on the wall with many cities in the USA and many countries around the world imposing the end of ICE vehicles by 2030, development into electric is being made by companies with much larger engineering, manufacturing, and distribution networks. To think that Tesla will continue to double it’s sales every year is just not possible with competition entering the marketplace. That’s not to say Tesla will not remain one of the larger electric car companies, but they’re going to have to change a lot of their ideologies to maintain their competitive advantage. It’s easy to be the best when you’re the only one putting in an honest effort."
2021-04-22 10:23:31,wallstreetbets,"I think those brand loyalists will be a minority. Not a tiny fraction, but not the majority.  Someone will compare range, price, charge speed and access, and they're going to pick Tesla more often than not."
2021-04-22 10:50:22,wallstreetbets,"I partly agree on the car side, but what you're not mentioning is that Tesla has become much more than cars. Sure VW, Volvo, Ford, Rivian and others are catching up, but Tesla has already expanded to many other markets... solar roof, semi, GIGA, and they probably have the biggest charging network ever. It's been expanding in the EU like crazy even during the pandemic. It's a mistake often made where we only compare Tesla to other car manufacturers. Volvo and Rivian aren't getting in the solar panel, roof and battery market. Tesla has a huge advantage there and so far ahead. Plus their relationship with SpaceX sharing some engineering teams strengthen its network."
2021-04-22 11:19:52,wallstreetbets,"prepare to be surprised.  you are wrong on most accounts of other companies being more capable.  Tesla has far superior engineering talent, far superior manufacturing ( literally work in automotive plants almost every day). and distributing via dealerships is just a way to loose 10-15% margin.  Tesla is the only company capable of making batteries in large quantities, and the only company with good software.  they will continue to wreck the whole market and 2021 will have double the deliveries of 2020,  2022 will be at least 50% gain YOY AGAIN."
2021-04-22 11:09:23,wallstreetbets,"I will repeat... 4680 cells and single casts.

Let me know when other automakers move on from their outdated skateboards. Per Elon Musk, each die cast machine gets rid of 300 robots. That is you can cast a single part or you can program and validate 300 robots to do an inferior job (and have to deal with the servicing of all those robots). Texas, I think will have 8 (maybe more) of them, so that is 2,400 robots not needed.

Let me know when other automakers expect to have a battery that can compete with the advantages the 4680 offers (in ability to mass manufacture economically, in performance, and in being made structural).

The competition is so far behind it is sad. The thought process going through the executives of every automaker that is taking this seriously is how do I cash out before our investors realize that our EV plans are a decade behind Tesla's."
2021-04-22 10:37:12,wallstreetbets,"If car buyers were rational, they would already be picking Tesla, and the majority of the market is not. Tesla makes an amazing product and it is by far and away the best car on the road right now, but 4runners outsell model Y’s, despite being a 10 year old design and a dinosaur in comparison. 

Ultimately the discussion boils down to the stock and whether it is a good buy. Personally, I believe Lucid’s stocks will considerably out perform Tesla’s over the next 10 years. Tesla’s stocks have everything to lose and Lucid has everything to gain in the coming EV years."
2021-04-22 11:00:19,wallstreetbets,"I know about all of that, but am not fully informed on the markets they operate in, which is why I was clear to make the distinction of their automotive enterprises. 

Lucid is also engaging in home battery systems, but like I said, that isn’t where my interests lie, and I’m not informed enough to have a discussion about those operations. 

I think Tesla is a great company and they will absolutely continue to dominate their markets, but I honestly cannot see them doubling their automotive sales year over year like the comment initially mentioned. 

For my money, Lucid is a better speculative play. I don’t make any remarks about Tesla’s current valuation or the future valuation, simply on their competitive advantage in the EV sector as a car manufacturer."
2021-04-22 11:37:45,wallstreetbets,"Tesla reminds me in a way of asian car companies, where they expand into other markets besides cars and make things like generators and farm equipment. Tesla is just as much a solar power company, an autonomous vehicle company, a software company, etc., as much as it is an electric car company."
2021-04-22 10:44:44,wallstreetbets,"It's because Tesla can't make enough Y's to overtake said 4Runner. Berlin and Austin will both produce small numbers this year and ramp over the course of 2022 and start additional construction projects on top of that.

They're production constrained. And even WITH all these factories online there will still unmet demand. So they'll  build even more factories."
2021-04-22 11:21:28,wallstreetbets,This is ridiculous. Tesla is making their cars as fast as they can.

2021-04-22 14:05:40,wallstreetbets,"Joe Manchin isn’t letting a 43% tax go through. However, the question is if the market knows that and is pricing in a compromise number. Let’s say Manchin comes out and say, sure 40% is ok for the people who literally make 1M+, then we might see the market crash to 380 SPY. A form of tax hike is very much possible btw because this bill will be done through reconciliation. Republicans won’t be able to just get rid of it if Dems pass in time before the midterms even if they win the house because new laws can be vetoed."

2021-04-22 13:29:45,wallstreetbets,"I think it is only for one state

&#x200B;

OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — A new tax on capital gains would be imposed on  the sale of stocks and bonds in excess of $250,000 under a measure  approved Wednesday by the Washington House.

The measure passed on a 52-46 vote after nearly two hours of debate in the Democratic-led chamber.

&#x200B;

Supporters of the tax say that Washington — one of just a  few states without an income tax — leans too heavily on its sales tax,  disproportionately affecting those with less income. The money expected  to be raised is tagged for child care and early learning."

If it gets implemented why would you even sell at that point, might as well make more money (if you are making more than a million). How is the logic oh no if I make too much money I’ll be taxed and lose some of it. Better make less money instead overall so I can still pay taxes but less."

T has been trading sideways for over 2 years however they just might be about to break out from $30 all the way to $34- $35. That’s hardly a breakout but for T that’s a big deal and for it’s CALL OPTIONS even more.  They are cheap & have a very low IV (the dream). 

They report today and their cell phone, internet, direct tv businesses really don’t matter at all.  It’s ALL ABOUT HBO-MAX.  If their new subscription #’s are above estimate T will most likely will earn a multiple expansion just like DISC & VIAC did.  

So far this year it’s nudged above $31 only to retract back to $29-$30.   Premarket it’s up almost 4% and trading at $31.25 (you never see this type of action from T)

2021-04-22 13:53:15,wallstreetbets,The market was just looking for anything to dump and Biden tax is the catalyst even though the drop was like 2 hours late since the tax proposal has been talked about since the morning
2021-04-22 13:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Holy fucking testicles, I am done for the day. I’m just going to keep destroying money if I continue trying to trade in this. Just going to hold on to these remaining SPY puts over the weekend and take break, this was fuk"

2021-04-22 14:06:56,wallstreetbets,If you look at the june correction spy started dropping during the afternoon and people freaked like this and then it dropped another $15 within a day.  A double whammy like that now will actually wipe out everyone here and drop spy like $25

2021-04-22 14:13:00,wallstreetbets,Retail is typically last to sell. Don't let that be you. Hedge your shit take some profit for a real dip(correction)

2021-04-22 14:23:29,wallstreetbets,So long term capital gains might go up... Just curious is the Nancy Pelosi's and other congress people making big stock trades on the regular use accounting tricks to pay that rate?  Hard to imagine her being super eager considering the number of stock transactions she submits to congressional record but... It seems like she should already be paying normal rates?
2021-04-22 14:23:40,wallstreetbets,If they raise capital gains tax next year there's gonna be a lot of selling of GME before the end of this fiscal year lol.

2021-04-22 06:41:21,wallstreetbets,"Stock futures are down a bit as of 0630. The Russell 2000 is off about 0.3%, Nasdaq and Dow by about 0.1%. S&P 500 roughly flat. This follows a day of major gains across risk assets. Russell 2000 added 2.3% yesterday, with the Nasdaq clocking gains of 1.2%.

If only somebody had told you yesterday might be a buying opportunity? Oh wait, somebody did and that somebody was me.

In fairness it isn’t hard to predict these things when you just have the same patterns repeating themselves. When stocks sell off due to anything related to COVID, it’s been a safe bet that the situation will reverse itself after a couple of days. 

Not ready to make any major predictions about today though. It’s another busy day of earnings: AT&T and Biogen among those reporting before the bell. Dow Inc. just came in ahead of estimates. Later we have reopening stocks American Airlines and Southwest Airlines. Airlines have been one of the few disappointments during earnings season so far.

We also have initial jobless claims at 0830 and existing home sales at 1000.

Stocks are still about 1% off of the record highs they set last week so who knows there probably is more upside in the medium term."

1. How exactly did you expect us to pay for all the stimulus checks?

Wow. There dumb people in the market. Just because Biden ""Proposes"" a hike in capital gains causes everyone to did a massive sell-off. I think that was one of his announcements when he was running for president. This was expected to happen. It's still under consideration. Unless Biden signs it, It's not official.

Tax his car, Tax his gas, Find other ways to tax his ass.

Tax all he has, Then let him know, That you won't be done till he has no dough.

When he screams and hollers, Then tax him some more, Tax him till he's good and sore.

Then tax his coffin, Tax his grave, Tax the sod in which he's laid.

Put these words Upon his tomb, 'Taxes drove me to my doom...'

When he's gone, Do not relax, Its time to apply the inheritance tax."

2021-04-22 09:09:04,wallstreetbets,"So MVIS isn't a ""short squeeze"" play.  It is a play that is fundamentally geared at a buyout in the next few months for 10b+.  If you read the DD on the subreddit, most likely a buyout would see a share price of 40-80 dollar range which means there is still a lot of running room.  Again, to stress, it is not a short squeeze play."
2021-04-22 09:08:44,wallstreetbets,MVIS cycles between ~10-20 regularly. You're good.
2021-04-22 09:50:15,wallstreetbets,And it drops for 13.90 30 seconds after I buy. Sweet. Gotta love that FOMO.

2021-04-22 15:42:49,wallstreetbets,"""risking your capital"". Stonks go up bro. Making profits off capital gains is the easiest fucking work there is for income earned and is currently taxed the least. Not crying tears over here for the poor boys at Melvin capital."
2021-04-22 15:48:26,wallstreetbets,"If you're already a wealthy investor it could be as high as 43% (When the new 39.6% rate couples with an already existing 3.8% rate)... Remember this is the mentioned new  MARGINAL amount. This only applies to you if you make capital gains over $1 million dollars a year on your investments... It would only slightly change if you make less $1 million a year. If you make more than $1 million a year on capital gains investments...boo fucking hoo...and again it's marginal... It only goes into effect on the money you make past $1 million dollars. You make $999,999 a year in capital gains? the hypothetical 43% doesn't affect you.

And before we hastily jump to conclusions and start screaming ""communism""- remember this isn't even in a proposed bill yet. It's leaked from someone in the whitehouse. My money is on this either never happens or something between this and where we are currently gets passed.

What does that mean for us retarded short terms WSB options traders? abso-fucking-lutely nothing. lol we are already are taxed at our highest marginal tax rate on our dumb ass trades."

2021-04-22 15:37:31,wallstreetbets,"I've tried to block political stuff in the past, going so far as to make a bot that evaluated your recent political activity across the whole site and then was extra strict with certain keywords in your comments/submissions, but I found that trying to filter out keywords like notable people's names and stuff ends up catching good posts and getting us in hot water despite good intentions and user support. I think if we tried that now we'd get accused of hating/loving whatever stock happened to be in proximity to some political nonsense.

The bot was kinda neat, if you spend all day in politicalhumor or the_donald it'd stop you from saying lame things here but try to let you still get through if you were saying anything that didn't contain obvious keywords like ""nazi, commie, libtard, etc"". I stopped running it after things simmered down, didn't seem necessary anymore.

What are you seeing a lot of? Any particular obviously filterable keywords that aren't valid in market contexts?"

2021-04-22 12:29:25,wallstreetbets,"Carnitas my dude, 🙏🏼"
2021-04-22 12:33:38,wallstreetbets,No way I hold through earnings - question is how long to ride this run.
2021-04-22 12:50:40,wallstreetbets,More like Vega gang lol
2021-04-22 14:12:59,wallstreetbets,Need a Black Friday one time come on please
2021-04-22 14:54:54,wallstreetbets,this. sell the 411put for a bullish spread or sell the 409 for a bearish spread
2021-04-22 14:57:41,wallstreetbets,100% agree
2021-04-22 15:00:06,wallstreetbets,"I'll be honest, I think this guy fuks..."
2021-04-22 15:25:09,wallstreetbets,Stepping over a dime to pick up a penny

2021-04-22 10:15:46,wallstreetbets,Travel nursing is the way to go.  They don’t pay shit in taxes
2021-04-22 09:20:41,wallstreetbets,"May 21 expiration. Buy 11c, sell 10c,  buy either 9p or 8p

The call credit spread is a bearish spread that netted premium to finance the puts. The calls will go down in price, therefore, you could buy them back for less and keep the profit. And the put increases in price as the price drops. This is risky, but the spread is has a defined risk. Huge potential here. I would suggest adjusting spread strikes if the morning opens substantially lower here"
2021-04-22 09:58:46,wallstreetbets,I just cant believe many people are willing to pay 12 bucks every month for online courses when they have the option to go outside / do courses in real life / go to gyms
2021-04-22 15:39:52,wallstreetbets,How many you got?
2021-04-22 09:23:20,wallstreetbets,Thanks for all the extra info as well! I had been eyeing the 5/21 10 and 11c for a spread. Working with a smaller account at the moment so can’t tie up too much in collateral. When would you typically close your spread? Do you wait close to expiration?
2021-04-22 15:43:28,wallstreetbets,"I've got hella sputnik V, bolsonaro said it works great"
2021-04-22 09:27:21,wallstreetbets,"I just wait until I'm happy with profit on it. Almost never hold out to expiration. I will typically close out all legs as one once I see a 20%-300% gain on my original premium. This could take a few minutes, or a few days when it moves favorably on bad news."
2021-04-22 09:40:55,wallstreetbets,Past couple of weeks I’ve been working on taking profit at 50% + instead of letting it ride and crash. But only spreads I’ve played with are bull call spreads. I like the idea of rolling the premium from the spread right into puts
2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,SEC considering more transparent derivatives and short selling rules 
2021-04-22 04:29:23,wallstreetbets,"The sad truth is no matter what new regulations are put in place, every fund will spend unbelievable time and effort to find a new way to not have to report all holdings

2021-04-22 09:20:26,wallstreetbets,Putting any faith what so ever in the SEC to actually regulate the markets in a way that is fair to the retail investor is the same as having faith that your drunk ass step dad will stop beating your mom.

Perhaps not all at once, but it's a start."

2021-04-22 11:56:53,wallstreetbets,"The Wall Street playbook on regulation is actually extremely straight forward.

1.  De-regulate or have enough loopholes / complex instruments to circumvent sensible risk management.
2.  Eventually holes create systemic risk and exacerbate bubbles.
3.  Markets crash, Goldman and frontrunners get out first and make money by having net short position.
4.  Public is furious because normal people are fucked for no fault of their own.
5.  Goldman and frontrunners use deep political ties and leverage public sentiment to add back regulation, ideally regulation that will disproportionately hurt competitors is best and a bonus, but mainly restoring ""confidence"" in the system is essential to start making money again.
6.  Return to 1.  Once people forget and shit calms down."

2021-04-22 04:43:06,wallstreetbets,"Thats essentially telling equity holders that they dont actually own the underlying and they cant lend it out if they would like to. Its going to be rough to pass. As someone who has benefited from allowing my shares to be borrowed, i personally dont mind it. Its risk on the short sellers part and its something that actually creates unbelievable opportunities for people to make money.

Nothing about over shorting GME hurt anyone except the HF. If you jumped in in the 300s.... that wasnt a smart decision"

2021-04-22 15:12:51,wallstreetbets,"I mean its not hard to make proper rules though, its not like institutions were finding the ways around the rules, the rules just didnt exist in the first place because they arent backed up by a meaningful threat in case those rules are broken. If not properly disclosing positions were to cost an institution 10% of their holdings in cash you can bet they would do extra diligence reporting every shit one of their interns took as a position"

2021-04-22 07:07:37,wallstreetbets,"WS always said short selling was needed to add liquidity to the market.  Nonsense!  Churning 10,000,000 shares of a low float company to short it into oblivion is not a proper excuse to create questionable liquidity.

The objective of Hedge Hog short selling is to scare retail investors out of their shares.  The SEC sits back watching porn on their PCs while the naked shorting of air shares flashes past on the big screen behind them."
2021-04-22 14:38:33,wallstreetbets,Yep that paralegal probably makes $20-25hr
2021-04-22 19:15:15,wallstreetbets,You forgot the 5 minute phone call for $250...
2021-04-22 18:21:25,wallstreetbets,Right?
2021-04-22 19:39:34,wallstreetbets,Honestly a fine based off quarterly earnings that could actually make them lose more than just the deal which had misconduct would be orgasmic.
2021-04-22 07:11:40,wallstreetbets,"Short selling isn't about liquidity.

It's about information and better price discovery.

It provides an incentive for contrarians to do research on a stock that is counter from the bull case.

Without short sellers many fraudulent stocks would just continue to rise until they blew up.

Short sellers give other investors an opportunity to research the bear case with that information.

I don't understand what you're thinking and why you believe that the SEC is watching home movies of your mom with your best friend."
2021-04-22 10:28:41,wallstreetbets,"at times market makers can naked short if they don't have a security and someone wants to purchase it, that's not a bad thing, the alternative is to kick back a ""no, you can't buy this""

naked short selling by funds was made illegal in 2008, and for all the arguments eve seen that its still happening, they're all funny enough short on the proof. 

the objective of hedge fund short selling is price discovery, and making money, they don't give a shit about retail anything lol."

2021-04-22 13:05:05,wallstreetbets,yea well it’s 18k worth in tsla (10.59% weightage* 169k) so pretty close to a yolo
2021-04-22 04:00:56,wallstreetbets,"well they could be if this was a penny stock or some shit, but not an ETF"

2021-04-22 07:33:53,wallstreetbets,Those losses are surprisingly small considering the Archegos loss is around 4.4 billion.

2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why $PTON is going to bounce back hard With current events of negative light coming to Peloton due to operator negligence, their stocks have dropped significantly. I want to remind everyone why their stocks will not only soar back up to the $150 mark, but why it'll go even further than that. 

First off, as the pandemic hit and caused everyone to be forced to stay at home, the desire for residential fitness equipment skyrocketed. Even till today, residential and commercial customers are still having a hard time getting their hands on new dumbbells and strength equipment. Peloton monopolized hard on this pandemic not only by selling a shit ton of residential equipment such as spin bikes and treadmills, but by also requiring a pretty hefty subscription based service to use them. Something around $39 a month. 

Second off, during late last year they made the financial decision to buy out a MAJOR fitness company that has been making commercial treadmills, ellipticals, upright and recumbent bikes, and several different strength equipment for 40 years. Peloton bought out Precor, along with all of their factories. Gyms will still be buying Precor simply for the name. Most gyms once they have a brand they like, keep buying that same brand for everything. Precor will still be a heavily demanded product. 

Peloton now has their hands dipped into a massive chunk of the fitness market, both residential and commercial. And with their residential side also pulling in all those subscription based fees, they aren't short for money anywhere. 

As for the recent accidents involving Peloton treadmills, all treadmills are dangerous and can kill you. This isn't something unique to Peloton. I don't care if they have roller guards on them or not, there is not one single treadmill out there that will protect you, a child, a pet, or any item from being sucked underneath the belt. 

If you want to prevent unnessary injury or death, remove your safety key from the treadmill when not in use if you live with children. Fitness equipment are not toys. 

Peloton will bounce back from this, and when they do, they will still be neck deep in both the residential and the commercial markets."
2021-04-22 00:05:20,wallstreetbets,As soon as people start mingling they’ll drop that subscription like a hot rock.

A subset of current owners will stop using them, they will sit in a corner and collect dust. Later they will hit the secondary market. Their market will shrink due to a smaller pool of potential customers (those who want them and can afford them). Without some major innovation I think we’ve seen their top.

2021-04-22 02:52:05,wallstreetbets,"A lot of problems with this:

- 90% of people quit their ""new"" exercise routines after 3 months.

- Once COVID restrictions let up, people are going to shy away from just working out at home

- On the other hand, the subscription is more than ""just"" the bike / treadmill content.  This might help.


- In regards to the merger, would need to understand the details.  What is the impact on the balance sheet, for instance. What are the margins / sales cycles (no pun intended) for the commercial equipment / is the plan to just sell the same shit or to try and upsell to something more profitable w/ recurring revenue?


I'd say it is 60/40; however, that sales / subscriptions are going to drop significantly as COVID lets up.  

I agree that the death is a short-term negative impact on the stock, though."

2021-04-22 00:37:10,wallstreetbets,"JPMorgan gives $PTON a buy rating even with the treadmill safety issue. Peloton hasn’t called it a safety issue per say and they reiterate to follow the safety and instructions manual. Every mechanical equipment has safety concerns if you’re not safe around it. Pinch points, kinetic energy, stored energy, etc. Peloton has a market for its product and its doing a job selling it. Read the full equity research report here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/streetguru/comments/mu77pb/pton_jp_morgan_recommends_buying_the_pullback_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
2021-04-22 12:02:21,wallstreetbets,"Peloton has amazing fundamentals and great growth prospects. I’ve owned the bike for 2 years and I’ve been a member of a cheap gym as well so the two can coexist. Plus, it’s not just a workout; it’s fun with dope music and it’s like a video game racing against others.

On a side note, peloton was baselessly attacked by the cpsc over the weekend without any statistical proof that the tread plus is more dangerous than other treadmills. The US government should not be attacking businesses like this unless there is actual statistical and hard proof that a product is dangerous when being used as intended. In addition, Cramer and his CNBC cronies are hating. They are the old guard that supports shitron and short sellers and the very old guard we seek to over throw. Support pton and fight the resistance.

Also, I wanted to add that peloton pledged 100 million dollars last summer when it was a much smaller company with fewer resources to fight racial inequality. Again, let’s fight the resistance and support a company looking to get people healthy/feel good about themselves and promote diversity."
2021-04-22 00:48:56,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I don’t want to sit on a bike that has been in between someone’s else’s cheeks for same reason I don’t want to sit on others people farts in used cars.
2021-04-22 06:49:47,wallstreetbets,"This company wasnt doing anything special even during the first half of COVID, they managed to get some gains later in H2 2020 but I can't see them doing very well in the medium and long term. There may be a market for upper class trophy wives or affluent people who don't have time to get to a gym,  but is that enough to sustain such a SP and market growth?

\-overpriced: Their equipment costs over 3 times what equal but brands cost. $2k for a stationary bike? You're having a giggle. There's also better specialist equipment out there for less money that people who are serious about training would opt for too.

\-Subscription: $39 for a monthly subscription on a consumer level is ridiculous, especially when their ipad app costs $12 a month. You can literally set your laptop next to your $400 stationary bike, find a spin workout on youtube and done, same shit. $39 a month is like the average price for a gym membership in the states. Sure its more expensive in cities but who tf is going to want to keep a stationary bike in a small ass NYC apartment? COVID is ending, very doubtful people are going to want to stay inside more than they have to.

\-B2B: There may be a case for the more pricey gyms out there, but shelling out so much money for constant use equipment won't be attractive to most as gym as breaks are common.   Saving on spin instructors may be a case, but considering how much more expensive these bikes are, I'd argue there's not enough of a saving for the initial investment.

\-Industry: The fitness industry is one of the most ""fad"" industries on the planet. Huge brands come and go, and this company is offering 0 innovation as far as I can see."

I don't care if they have roller guards on them or not, there is not one single treadmill out there that will protect you, a child, a pet, or any item from being sucked underneath the belt.

That's right. Those roller guards are to protect the weak-ass rollers on other treadmills.  Pelestrong treadmills don't need 'em."

2021-04-22 05:39:17,wallstreetbets,"Peloton will be making a large part of its revenue from gyms though, so either way it has an advantage. Gyms are purchasing Peloton equipment as well as universal subscriptions meaning gym users can make free Peloton accounts. Since gyms make most of their money from people buying and not using their subscriptions, not only will Peloton pick up a slice of that revenue, but it will pick up a lot of the gym users who start out at the gym and give up quickly."
2021-04-22 00:17:41,wallstreetbets,I disagree. My wife had a $140 per month Equinox membership pre-COVID that she swapped for peloton and now we both can take advantage for a third of the monthly cost.  The cost of the bike has been nearly offset by not paying equinox for the past 13 months. Weve invested a little more in our home gym and couldn’t be happier.
2021-04-22 00:13:09,wallstreetbets,Naw. Spin classes are expensive so this is a great thing to keep to do both
2021-04-22 03:25:53,wallstreetbets,But why? Gyms aren't really enjoyable places are they?
2021-04-22 08:21:43,wallstreetbets,"Doubt that. It's a lot easier to justify paying monthly subscription, when you dropped 5k onto the equipment. Unlike Netflix, their subscriptions are much more ""sticky""."
2021-04-22 12:52:57,wallstreetbets,"And bikes will just sit, empty? I think it will become the norm for gym clients to expect them to have Pelotons"
2021-04-22 05:43:54,wallstreetbets,"It's $90-$92 where the real support lies. If they break that, it's worth being concerned, but Peloton already broke $100 a couple weeks ago when the news first hit about the child dying, and it recovered again without breaking the key support. It's the same news just hitting harder. I think the same will happen this time, so I'mma wait for reversal and buy the dip."

2021-04-22 17:12:32,wallstreetbets,"I've seen this argument a lot about at home fitness brands. You can't find entire programs on youtube/for free anywhere really. These sort of people buy these kinds of products so they don't have to think about what they're doing. They just want to follow along and think/know they're doing things correctly. Everyone knows you can find a free one-off workout online, but then what's next? Will they actually take the time to dig and put together a program? Not PTON customers. They have the money for someone else to do the thinking for them."

Average gym membership is $507 a year. 
You’re also trying to tell me people don’t put in extra money/effort in appearance at home vs the gym?
So gas and wear and tear and time spent commuting isn’t a factor for you. No wonder you’re stuck at a $10  gym. 

I’m not worried at all homey. I’ve bought a lot of pton at dirt cheap prices. I just think it’s stupid you’re going to miss out. 

Lastly. Most gyms make their money off people who don’t actually use their membership. Educate yourself before you start posting nonsense"
2021-04-22 10:46:54,wallstreetbets,"Planet Fitness' business model is based on people not showing up to the gym. That's why they market to people who never go to the gym. The lunk alert is to keep away people who would actually use the gym. They provide just enough value to make cancelling your $10 membership not worth it e.g. pizza, bagels, massage chairs. Peloton is a whole different echelon of customers. Their content is what separates them, not the hardware. You can get a knockoff bike for cheap, but you don't get their subscription platform."

The only difference is that Planet Fitness will actually allow you to cancel, while the other ones lock you into annual contracts that auto-renew unless you give them a written 90-day notice of intent to cancel.

2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,$VIAC taking off!!!! Rocket 🚀 Don’t miss it out before opening! 
2021-04-21 23:27:55,wallstreetbets,Why will it take off ?
2021-04-21 23:43:40,wallstreetbets,"Are you retarded for reals? Why don't you sell 25 covered calls @ $100 strike for Jan 20 23 for a premium of 1.33 (try limit at 1.36) and receive $3400 to write a guarantee future limit sell (selling covered calls)  at a price you're cool with letting the stock go? If the stock never gets to $100 by that time you win $3400 from writing that call in premium. If the stock goes above $100 by that time and beyond you will not receive anymore than the strike price of $100 per share. Since you're cool with that, sell the covered calls instead that last for years and you'll never have to worry about price ever again. I write weekly cc's just to make an easy 1k or so to average down. You could use this $3400 to purchase a many calls as possible if you're really feeling confident. Have fun ape.

Edit: What's your price per share?"
2021-04-22 06:15:15,wallstreetbets,Ideal Long term investment.  Can reach $150 in few years.
2021-04-21 23:34:33,wallstreetbets,Is it even shorted? Positions were liquidated through a margin call on the HF. Looks like natural recovery...

2021-04-21 23:29:43,wallstreetbets,DD!!! Short squeeze + under valued + beat earnings to be released!
2021-04-22 08:21:26,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't really write leaps on a stock like this, fundamentals could easily bring the stock above 100, even pre-covid levels of 150.

I'm bullish as fuck on VIAC short term and cautiously optimistic long term.  If I had the capital to buy 2500 shares I'd probably set up bear call spreads backed up by the underlying stock.

This way you earn weekly income from the stocks and hold a ""moon insurance"" for cheap in case it goes vertical.
Only way to ""lose out"" is if the underlying beats the sold call strike+ premium but doesn't surpass the bought call strike +premium."
2021-04-22 00:42:56,wallstreetbets,"Dude you are super RETARDED. THE REASON YOU DONT SELL CALLS FOR 2023 IS IF VIACOM HAPPENS TO SQUEEZE PAST 100 YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SHARES. YOU WILL GET STUCK WITH A HUGE LOSS ON THE CALLS AND IF THE STOCK ROCKETS AND DROPS BACK TO EARTH YOU WILL BE PISSED. 

I DID THIS ONE TIME WITH BOEING. I SOLD 220 CALLS FOR LIKE 1.00, THE STOCK WENT FROM 190 TO 240, MY CALLS SKYROCKETED TO 15.00, AND I COULDN'T SELL MY SHARES WITHOUT BOOKING THE LOSS ON THE COVERED CALLS. 

DO NOT SELL CALLS"
2021-04-21 23:51:46,wallstreetbets,Thanks Ape!
2021-04-22 10:53:48,wallstreetbets,Agree. I would rather keep writing short dated calls like you but if your not active trader and aren’t looking to sell jan 23s not bad
2021-04-22 06:20:40,wallstreetbets,Likely before Xmas 2021!
2021-04-22 19:52:44,wallstreetbets,I hate hearing “shorted” and “squeezes” now. It’s just a recovery play like you said that’s all. Not everything has to be a short or gamma squeeze

2021-04-22 02:50:24,wallstreetbets,"85 day old account check.

“Short squeeze” check. 

“under valued” check. 

This is classic “I learned about stocks 3 months ago and now I think I know what earning plays is and how to make short squeeze happen. What do you mean Greeks? Yeah I like them better than the romans.”"
2021-04-21 23:30:45,wallstreetbets,Just saying short squeeze doesn't make it true
2021-04-22 01:55:04,wallstreetbets,This dudes right.
2021-04-22 14:42:27,wallstreetbets,"Depending on how much capital you have you could sell a put and promise to buy those shares in the future at a later date while they hold that money as a covered money put and you get paid to write the contract and you could buy calls right now. 

For instance, every retard with 100k wants to YOLO into GME and do it wrong. Even me. If I knew then what I know now, I'd take 100k and sell 10 $100 puts on GME for Jan 20 23 and get PAID over 44k in premiums and immediately place calls on the stock if I'm bullish. If I don't know which way the stock is trading, I'd wait until there's a dip and buy as many options (long term focus on premium only) and utilize that leverage to buy and sell those calls every couple weeks (same amount every time to track earnings). If the price goes up and the contract expires, you'll have to unfortunately buy those shares at the price you agreed to and then immediately you can sell them for a profit. If the price tanks, you might get called on you contract and own 1000 shares trading at a price lower than you can sell AT THAT TIME.   You then have to begrudgingly write a covered call at a price (150?) Down the road and they'll pay you a premium again and then you watch your shares go bye bye if it's called. All I do is win with my strategy."
2021-04-22 01:11:26,wallstreetbets,"If you're okay with the stock leaving your hands at the price you placed, it isn't a loss. Only FOMO queens worry about gigantic gains and looking at those as losses if you held. Nobody is clairvoyant, but you can write covered calls. Take GME for example. I've averaged down from the $220's per share to 161 per share while adding 200 more shares from writing covered calls at $480. Guess what I get to do until then? Write weekly calls until my price per share gets so low that if my shares get exercised and I sell each contract for $480 it'll be more than a 300% profit than it already is. I also have used my money to purchase calls in the future that even if GME sniffs $480 my calls calls could be sold to pay back the difference. But I'll continue to average down until it was basically a limit sell at $480. It only took me 4 weeks to average down $61 and this is including my dumbass that lost 7k on a call. I'd say I'm doing fine with a realized gain of 20k on 105k within 3 months of investing coupled with a bunch of stupid yolo bets and unwise rookie mistakes. Investing is individually unique, you may dislike how I use covered calls but to each their own."
2021-04-22 13:04:26,wallstreetbets,Hey caps is on

2021-04-22 09:27:29,wallstreetbets,Lol you've given no reasons as to why what he said isn't true. A 10 pe ratio for a solid company is undervalued and there's many factors that can contribute to a short squeeze not just short float %.
2021-04-22 00:29:44,wallstreetbets,Lol everything Is a short squeeze now
2021-04-22 02:15:37,wallstreetbets,He didn't say it. He declared it
2021-04-22 08:14:27,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, but there is still 17% of the floating shares that are actually shorted. They will have to buy them back at a moment... but when ? That’s the question, but if Q1 is great enough there won’t be new shorts and many classic asset manager will come back on"

2021-04-22 11:35:04,wallstreetbets,"What factors would work together beside the short interest to create a short squeeze for VIAC? 

I also want to know what the thesis is on this. Show me a image of how you personally think this is work out as a short squeeze."
2021-04-22 17:07:39,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Unfortunately it comes from paper handed retards that bought in at $5 and placed $100 cc at that date. They're okay with a 1900% profit on that money. And then some retard in the future will see a covered put at a $150 strike a bargin when I place it if assigned those shares sooner.
2021-04-22 14:26:11,wallstreetbets,For a nominal fee of course.
2021-04-22 00:18:55,wallstreetbets,"Depending how crazy you want to go I'd sell 25 covered calls at $40 strike price for Jan 20 23 and get roughly 24k for that contract and immediately buy calls for the future and hopefully you can buy more than 25 contacts so you can really increase your leverage off your shares you were hoping they sell at $100 to make 155k in profits. I use owning shares to my advantage by placing the calls at prices it won't reach and pocket easy money.  The calls should be as many as possible and you hope they catch up to your contact so if it starts heading towards the moon you can sell a couple options to buy back your 2500 shares and go moon walking. 🌙 

Or you can use the $3400 in calls alone and wait for a long time for the market to drop and you can close your position. Have fun.

Edit: OK not financial advice."
2021-04-22 12:28:18,wallstreetbets,"Loads of things Volume, level of OTM Call buying and all the secondary factors that feed into them. 

Tbh I dont think anyone sees a crack up short squeeze but more of a factor which will push price action upwards and towards a more realistic valuation for the company. I think theres an easy 50% upside and minimal downside risk."

2021-04-22 01:34:38,wallstreetbets,"Talking about horrible advice, your dumbass said TSLA was dropping under 600 again 3 weeks ago. It's on what people would call.... an upward trend."
2021-04-22 00:54:29,wallstreetbets,"Dumbass he's literally getting paid to place a limit sell of 2500 shares in the form of 25cc with a $100 strike up until Jan 20 23. He gets absolutely zero extra dollars if the price goes to $105 and his shares go away because.... stay with me..... he placed a limit sell. With a covered call, he's okay with his shares leaving at $100 and he's getting paid a premium to write the contract. I'd say do the math but I doubt you could figure it out."

It's absolutely insane that so many people are betting it's going this low.

2021-04-22 06:05:49,wallstreetbets,It’s probably a matter of when gme takes off with the stock moving sideways. No fucker is selling by the looks of it lol

2021-04-22 11:16:15,wallstreetbets,Been selling weekly covered calls on my shares but IV has really dried up the last couple weeks.  If it ever spikes and my shares get called away may consider selling puts

2021-04-21 22:35:42,wallstreetbets,LMAO all you made was 11k on a once in a decade stock? this is why theta gang is a bunch of pretentious retards. You could have bought 1k worth of stock at 12 and just hold you would have made over 30k without trying to time short term trades. but you think you're a genius right?
2021-04-21 23:51:25,wallstreetbets,"Oh, this worked for 2 weeks so far? Wow great."

2021-04-22 06:15:17,wallstreetbets,Tons of MVIS posts by users with ~300 karma and nary a GME post. Wonder what could have changed...
2021-04-22 07:30:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the mods have been deleting GME posts. They even deleted a DFV tribute. The reason is that they ""want the sub the way it used to be"" and that there are others subs for GME content."
2021-04-22 05:33:35,wallstreetbets,"Stock is crabbing so people are just jerking off waiting for something to happen.

2021-04-22 12:26:45,wallstreetbets,"> or are the mods just deleting everything?

Mods emphasized that GME is allowed, but they will crack down on lower-quality content or unimpressive YOLOs. Nobody wants to see the hundredth guy in a row go ""All in"" on GME, meaning like 12k on shares."

2021-04-22 03:29:34,wallstreetbets,Maybe a bit of both. Stock has been sideways for a while now and exciting news is dwindling. Everyone's patience for ape army is also waning and I'm sure the mods are tired of it more then any of us
2021-04-22 08:21:21,wallstreetbets,"It's not the popular kid anymore, so the action cravers like me left GME for the 'thing that shall not be named'."

The other apes are clearly better at this than me. 🦧 😔"
2021-04-22 00:37:30,wallstreetbets,"At the peak of this in Jan I sold shit ton of GME $15, $20, $30 and $35p for 4/16. I've closed out most of them in Feb when IV decimated them but I had forgotten I sold some in one of our IRA and those expired worthless.

The 35p were going for $10~$12 (!!) at one point. IV was 700%. Even those $15-$20p were going for like $3-$6 or something.

Felt like free money. Strong return in less than 3 months. Even when GME drilled to $40s I don't think the premiums were ever close to $6 or so on those $35p.

Was much easier back then vs the IV level OP is selling now. One bad day can easily wipe his theta gang play here imo give he's selling fairly near the money."
2021-04-21 22:36:26,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 10 weeks

First time?"
2021-04-22 08:53:44,wallstreetbets,"> Like even if we acknowledge GME is high, the idea that it drops below $30 in the next year is equally insane at this point.

If the ""turnaround"" plans do not work, it is likely that the stock drops below $30 in the next year.     

Gamestop is far from being out of the woods, they haven't even articulated a plan yet and most people here are talking like they are undervalued at $150/share.

Look at 5 year chart of GME - that includes periods where the company's revenue was MUCH higher than it is right now."
2021-04-22 13:08:13,wallstreetbets,You have to go out like 2 years on a CSP to get 10%. WTF would you do that.
2021-04-22 09:10:34,wallstreetbets,gme can easily drop 50% in  a day unexpectedly

If you have 25k or more then you can PDT with no restrictions. If you close a day under 25k, you can't day trade until you close over 25k, but you can still trade. If you day trade while under 25k and marked PDT you will get 90 day restricted to closing positions only."
2021-04-22 01:02:39,wallstreetbets,If you are buying and then selling options on the same day you can get dinged for free-riding. Might that be the situation you're running into?

2021-04-22 01:35:35,wallstreetbets,"Wow.

I just sort of figured out options during the second run up.

Wish I could still sell 780c's for 7.5K. Those were the days.

On the bright side I've managed to accumulate 250 shares @ $56 DCA so 🚀🚀🚀

Can't wait for this thing to start bouncing around again."

I pretty much don't ever sell shares of anything unless my long-term thesis has changed or I want to free up cash to enter something new.  
  
Selling puts is a new strategy I'm trying out and today/tomorrow may very well be my reckoning. My breakeven for tomorrow is 151.25 so I don't think I'm looking at any major losses if any this week."

2021-04-22 10:01:55,wallstreetbets,"This and people also act like selling puts somehow makes you ""one of the shorts"" or some bullshit.

There's nothing magical about CSP's.  When it's flat or slightly going up (basically the default behavior of every stock) you do amazing.

When it tanks you get left holding an over priced asset.  There's no free lunch.  It's smart if the strike is at price you wanted to buy anyway though.

Edit: ofc if you were really bullish you lose all the upside though.  it's honestly best for stocks that are very solid but slightly overvalued and you basically treat the CSP like a limit buy order that you get paid to put in."
2021-04-22 11:50:45,wallstreetbets,"It's bullish as fuck, I'd say it's as bullish as buying shares."
2021-04-22 06:45:34,wallstreetbets,Selling puts?  But we only buy calls here we don't even know where the sell button is.

2021-04-22 00:17:03,wallstreetbets,I am good at buying high and selling low but only on long positions.
2021-04-21 23:45:36,wallstreetbets,"For clarification to u/Dontinvestwearvest ... You're selling puts when the stock price is low (put premiums are high) and buying them back when the stock price is high (put premiums are low). He said he uses margin, but you can cover your puts with cash as well. Heck, if GME is 160 and you want to buy, why pay 160? Sell a 140p instead and take the premium, whether or not you end up with the shares at the end of the week.  


I do this as well, just not on such a micro-managed level. I sell weekly puts. Roll them up/down/out on Thursday/Friday. If there's a mid-week surge, I consider repositioning like this as well. You pretty much just play them like you would the underlying security, except that the theta bleed is in your favor."
2021-04-21 23:37:23,wallstreetbets,I like your strategy man
2021-04-22 11:33:56,wallstreetbets,"i imagine that will keep working until it doesn't, and then you'll not feel to great about it.

selling calls is a fragile strategy that gives you a good chance of a small upside, with a small risk of a huge downside. this seems like a very bad bet to me."

2021-04-22 09:32:41,wallstreetbets,"That's becoming less and less likely. Volatility is dropping, volume is dropping. The long wedge has broken though the bearish trend. The market is starting to accept the current price. The median analyst price target is $27, with the average being $46.

So while it could still drop 50%, if you look at anything other then the options chain. It doesn't seem very likely.

To give you an idea, there's $7 puts a year out that yield like %8 returns on their BIDS."
2021-04-22 10:02:18,wallstreetbets,"It isn't really risking 100k when you're selling puts, in that you won't lose that money the same way you do buying calls. If you get assigned, you buy the stock.

2021-04-22 07:46:46,wallstreetbets,That's it!
2021-04-22 08:56:24,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the clarification. I do have over 25k and during the time of the position I was still over.
2021-04-22 08:54:28,wallstreetbets,Thanks I've never heard that term before
2021-04-21 23:59:21,wallstreetbets,You definitely belong on this sub.  PDT for sure applies to options
2021-04-21 23:57:00,wallstreetbets,PDT most certainly does apply to options.
2021-04-21 23:46:45,wallstreetbets,"I did a option spread on tsla last week, and was in the position for two hours and sold for a profit. I checked my account and it said I had 2 days remaining. Not sure just confused."

     (Congrats on those gains)"
2021-04-22 11:45:32,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the encouragement. I have 100 shares and I've been doing well selling covered calls. Using the weekly profit to buy puts to try to cash in on a big price move. It's been working OK but I have a bad habit of not cashing out of the puts soon enough and getting raped by theta.

What I might try is I think called a spread? I'll sell a cash covered put for say $150 but then also buy a put for $75 or something much lower capping my downside risk."
2021-04-22 04:05:53,wallstreetbets,He said naked puts. Could have meaned he would be a million in debt though.

2021-04-22 07:05:01,wallstreetbets,I see what you are saying. OP is probably selling covered puts and knows that people are degenerates on GME so is just selling short term puts.
2021-04-22 07:41:56,wallstreetbets,Just to clarify that their *extrinsic* value decreases as you approach expiry.
2021-04-22 12:59:44,wallstreetbets,So if you sell options the decrease in value as it approaches the expiry date is profit for the seller? I've known about theta gang for a while but I've never really know where to start dabbling in it.
2021-04-22 10:07:48,wallstreetbets,How are you selling options as an individual you don't already own?

2021-04-22 08:10:59,wallstreetbets,no because this is actually in the spirit of the sub. if you knew anything about the sub and options you'd realize that.
2021-04-22 17:14:51,wallstreetbets,He did the same thing (titled Last Post for a While or something similar) right before the turmoil in this sub and deleting of GME posts in early feb.

2021-04-22 10:11:03,wallstreetbets,but isn't it really risky.. so risky that you might get an insanely amount of debt.. while with calls you can kind of decide not to buy the option (if the stock drops price a lot instead of rising)
2021-04-22 11:42:28,wallstreetbets,"The downside risk is that you get stuck with the shares during a price crash, so I have a longer term put in place to hedge against that. I've been selling them at $200 which has lots of buyers but the stock rarely gets up that high so I haven't been assigned. Sooner or later it will get up there, I'll get assigned (my cost basis is $120) and I'll have to wait for a price drop to buy back in. But to me this is lower risk than selling puts."

2021-04-22 15:33:55,wallstreetbets,"I believe that this is incorrect.  It's cash-secured with margin cash.  A little bit different from a naked put because ""the naked put has much lower capital requirements and the cash can be deployed toward other investments. In contrast, the funds allocated to a cash-secured put must always be set aside.""  I had also called Schwab prior to doing this and confirmed this was the case.

2021-04-22 10:26:35,wallstreetbets,"I think he's just arguing that it's easy enough to say ""we totally have a turnaround plan!"" but between having a turnaround plan, executing it in that year or more that you mention, and finally seeing if it bears fruits, there is a long way to go.

Heck, every company doing poorly now has a turn around plan.

Yahoo had a turnaround plan. I don't own Altaba though."
2021-04-22 09:20:05,wallstreetbets,"True, it will be interesting to see how long the patience for this stock lasts when there is no short squeeze and it takes a long time to show any real progress."
2021-04-22 11:34:25,wallstreetbets,"They don't even have a ""new plan"" yet and you are already sure the new plan will blow away everything they have done in the past?

I'm not sure why so many people believe a company can simply re-make themselves AND grab market share from other companies already in that space.      

If it were that easy, don't you think the previous CEO would have done it already?  He had millions in profit incentives to do so.

Stop acting like the turnaround is a done deal and they are going to be wildly successful, not saying it is impossible but the odds are  against it."
2021-04-22 10:28:00,wallstreetbets,"saying it's unlikely it can drop 50% was exactly what DFV did in reverse by saying it could rise 50% or more.

Secured with margin cash means the funds would be borrowed if you need them and hence the put isn't secured at all. Margin requirements are subject to change at any time for the underlying based on volatility and you could be subject to a margin call. Something isn't cash secured with margin. Being ""secured"" with ""margin cash"" just means you'd be borrowing money from your broker. If you don't have the physical cash in your account to cover exercise/assignment in its entirety, it is a naked option."

I wouldn't recommend spreads on RH; they manage it in some weird ways that turned a profitable transaction into a loss a number of times before I got off of them."
2021-04-22 10:55:33,wallstreetbets,"True enough. But people are wanting GME to turn around. The IP is more valuable now then it was 5 months ago. Part of the success of a turn around is if people are willing to accept their new vision of what the company is.

The fact the CEO getting outted from game stop and every other move GME makes goes viral on reddit and other places. Shows how much people want something new from this company.

So I argue the chances of a turnaround with GME is far higher then with your other examples."
2021-04-22 12:57:30,wallstreetbets,Max risk on these is only realized if the stock goes to $0 and then is wiped off the face of the earth.
2021-04-22 00:34:27,wallstreetbets,"Just don't go in and out repeatedly of the exact same options contract. It looks to me like you're selling the contracts and then closing out those same contracts. You're not buying and selling the same contracts repeatedly so you should be good. It'd be a problem if you sold a contract bought it back at a loss then resold it again and rebought it at a loss and then resold it and then let it expire.

2021-04-22 13:25:37,wallstreetbets,"This is what confuses me about short put positions. For puts isn't it the same regardless? 

A CSP u have the cash locked up at Strike price × 100 per contract.

If u simply open the position without any cash, if u get assigned, ur still going to be buying 100 shares at ur strike price.

So whats the difference? What does it mean to be selling on margin when it comes to short put positions?

And based on OPs image. How can u tell its using margin?"
2021-04-22 10:32:39,wallstreetbets,The same way the big boys have been selling naked shorts for years.

Maybe when the stock floats back down south of $100 and pros are ""confident"" it's heading down they will try their luck a 3rd time shorting GME lol. I'd be a happy seller at $200."
2021-04-22 17:27:39,wallstreetbets,">A cash-secured put specifically refers to a put option that is sold when an investor has enough money in a margin account to cover the purchase of all shares that the put seller might be forced to buy.

2021-04-22 09:38:08,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the account. If you're straight brokerage, yes. If you're using a 401/457 you're probably only good for level 0. At that point it's all cash secured"
2021-04-22 13:08:00,wallstreetbets,Right
2021-04-22 06:40:34,wallstreetbets,"Sauce? 

Sounds a lot like wash sale stuff folks were talking about in last and first month of the tax year."
2021-04-21 22:45:20,wallstreetbets,"It happens, puts are often associated with bearish sentiment."
2021-04-21 23:35:02,wallstreetbets,Was not deep enough of a value
2021-04-21 23:40:18,wallstreetbets,"Whatever you want to think, but that's like saying $100 was too much back in Jan because DFV only paid $4. I think he is expecting a squeeze tbh, but you do you."
2021-04-22 08:09:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but he didn't sell those calls. He exercised them. Meaning he expects the price to go higher. He didn't pay $155 for those calls and even if it goes down he will make gains, but he would have sold them if he didn't think it was going up. So like I said, he has already paid the $12 for those shares, but he still got them when the price was at $155"
2021-04-22 08:23:27,wallstreetbets,Apparently OP’s broker is Schwab. See his comment below
2021-04-22 10:09:57,wallstreetbets,">naked  
>  
>100% margin

what?"
2021-04-22 12:01:49,wallstreetbets,"How do you know it's 100% margin?

I'm selling puts without putting out the cash first. Use IBKR with portfolio margin. They don't require the cash first, doesn't credit me with the cash gained from the sale, and doesn't really factor the entire potential loss risk against me in my portfolio."
2021-04-22 08:12:12,wallstreetbets,But also increase your risk exponentially yes
2021-04-22 08:25:13,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that’s what makes a WSB degenerate — high risk, high reward"
2021-04-22 14:14:58,wallstreetbets,"Selling puts below expected strike is neutral to bullish. OP expects strike to stay high so he won’t be assigned anything and can pocket the premiums.

Doing this on margin is free money if you guess right, because you only get charged interest for using margin if it is assigned. Reserving your margin buying power for the put does not cost anything.

However no brokers are allowing GME on margin right now, so this only makes sense if he can earn more via the puts than anything else he would invest the cash into."
2021-04-22 10:36:34,wallstreetbets,OP is relying on margin from his broker though
2021-04-22 13:41:46,wallstreetbets,"I GO ALL IN OKAY

2021-04-22 11:15:22,wallstreetbets,"I don’t need to, simply riding the wave.  Not sure what you are referring to though.  Cool story though Jumbly"
2021-04-22 02:47:08,wallstreetbets,"The wham on ANY stock is exactly the same when it tanks... Except I bought mine cheaper and collected premiums, while the real ""bag holders"" have nothing to show for it.

So, let's say you buy at $160 off the market and I sell a put at $140 instead for $8. It drops to $120 and my put is executed. Who's bags are lighter? < rhetorical>

And if it stays at $120, after a couple more weeks of $8 calls, I'll be back to profiting. You can take your loss. I don't have to."
2021-04-22 17:41:08,wallstreetbets,"I think you're confused. It is not cash-secured if it is not secured with your own cash. If you require borrowed funds, it is not cash-secured. Yes, you require a margin account to trade any options. But you're still confused. ""Has enough money in a margin account""--you're ignoring the ""has enough money"" part. That is different than has enough buying power. If you need to use margin, you don't have enough money because you need to borrow money to finance the transaction if exercised/assigned.

Again, those margin requirements are subject to change at any time based on volatility. If you sell a put, but you don't have enough cash (your own cash, not borrowed money) n your account to buy the underlying shares, it is a naked put. You very well might have enough buying power to buy the underlying shares on margin with borrowed money, but that doesn't make it cash-secured. It has to be secured by *your* cash, not your broker's cash."
2021-04-22 10:47:51,wallstreetbets,Nice I keep starting to apply then realize I'm not ready to trade options yet.
2021-04-22 11:56:42,wallstreetbets,Schwab won’t let you with GME.  100% margin requirement for GME right now.
2021-04-22 10:12:32,wallstreetbets,"Yah it’s an oxymoron, which is kind of my point."
2021-04-22 10:52:53,wallstreetbets,"I am new to this sub and as a Las Vegas resident, I'm very familiar with this ""high risk, high reward"" bet. Often I've come out on the wrong side. That is why I'd rather be a WSB degenerate instead of one at the 21 tables. I still have not bought any calls or options yet."
2021-04-22 10:42:55,wallstreetbets,Didn’t see that lol. Yea that’s a pretty risqué decision
2021-04-22 15:00:44,wallstreetbets,Today’s low is already $146. Still within that narrowing pennant. Big fucking deal

2021-04-22 09:07:25,wallstreetbets,"> The wham on ANY stock is exactly the same when it tanks

The difference of course is that it is much easier to get way over-leveraged with options than with owning stock and its especially easy to get lured into that trap when selling naked puts feels like free money - who doesn't love free money."
2021-04-22 15:33:37,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I just stick with a cash account, so it won't even let me get over-extended. Keeps me out of trouble."

It is definitely good that 10/10 patients were discharged from their study, but that is too small to make any conclusions.

2021-04-22 00:22:19,wallstreetbets,Will do!  Yes I know it is more than covid but their willingness to (in my opinion) inappropriately hype a product during covid is a good tell on how they will promote all of their proposed treatments
2021-04-22 10:35:31,wallstreetbets,No but this tells us what their company culture is like. Aka do not touch it with a mile long stick!

2021-04-22 08:20:01,wallstreetbets,Haha just read all the comments. Uhh yeah this is smart. You have conviction of a squeeze and don't know when yet. I was quite surprised by all the hate you got. You could set an alert and wait for it to start and then buy. If you don't have that luxury this will surely cover you. I've done this same thing to an extent. I've simultaneously sold credit spreads on it to fund the premium of the calls. Never thought about it before I accidentally did it and thought wow that's actually a really cool strat.

2021-04-22 10:54:05,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy a 900c for Jan 2022 and call it a day. If this squeeze it’ll hit 5k or whatever and that’s 400k in profit. They’re like 1000 dollars an option. You’ll cover the entire year and if it doesn’t squeeze by then then honestly fuck it at that point.
2021-04-22 11:05:36,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty new but I’m gonna say it doesn’t look good.

2021-04-22 06:00:32,wallstreetbets,Guys this is not that bad. Slowly buying a couple cheap options a week looking for a squeeze.. if he was ripping 3k a week on these things it’s a different story
2021-04-22 03:39:49,wallstreetbets,You're a fucking idiot
2021-04-22 09:07:33,wallstreetbets,"holy shit, you're the dumbest person on WSB....bro this stock BARLEY went over $500 for a 10th of a second with 140% + short interest.

2021-04-22 18:56:28,wallstreetbets,"Your long calls will be worthless upon expiration date unless you are correct on all three fronts: (1) direction, (2) magnitude, and (3) timeframe. If you are hoping you will be right, it is gambling. Of course, you will win big if you are in fact correct on all three, but the odds are against you.

Save your hard-earned cash, and research high-probability trades ."
2021-04-22 01:33:16,wallstreetbets,A deep itm call with a 90+dte expiration would have better results. Cheap otm calls are cheap because they expire worthless 90+% of the time.

2021-04-22 07:34:17,wallstreetbets,Blowing that 30K on hookers and coke would been more fun but hey it's your dough.  Rock on dude.
2021-04-22 09:09:48,wallstreetbets,These are some dogshit contracts. This leads me to believe you don’t understand options pricing.
2021-04-22 15:53:43,wallstreetbets,"REAL DIAMOND HANDS ARE NOT THOSE WHO HELD UNTIL THE SQUEEZE. Its easy to hold when you're loosing, knowing the price HAS to squeeze sooner or later and you'll find yourself in profits. REAL DIAMOND HANDS are those holding DURING THE SQUEEZE, knowing they could call it a day, sell and take profits, but CONTINUE TO HOLD because not only 10M$/share is the floor and only THE FLOOR, but also because all of this is a war for a cause bigger than us, that we can win only by BEING COORDINATED and TRUSTING EACH OTHER. REAL DIAMOND HANDS are ready to see the price make 50% (or more) retracements from high prices such as 100k to 50k, 500k to 250k or more, WITHOUT PANICKING OR THINKING WE REACHED THE PEAK. Why? Because THE PRICE IS WRONG. We set the price. Forger your usual techincal analysis. ALL SHORTS MUST COVER. How? BY BUYING BACK FROM SELLERS, NO MATTER THE PRICE. 

Hold the fucking line. The hardest past IS NOT DONE YET, DON'T FUCKING DANCE. FLOOR IS 10M$. Apes are strong, but only together. Let's stay together."
2021-04-21 21:59:38,wallstreetbets,Did news break of Elon buying them out? I’m confused
2021-04-21 22:32:12,wallstreetbets,Smart move. The 690 call is gonna pay off

Once you grow a few wrinkles on your brain you’ll connect the dots here and learn to buy shares and sell calls against them for those prices, and be cashing checks every week to buy more shares with."
2021-04-21 21:54:10,wallstreetbets,I don’t see the squeeze coming til after July. So I’m buying December calls
2021-04-22 03:10:53,wallstreetbets,How come only retarded GME calls reach the front now- this actually delays any upward motion  by giving hedge funds free money which they can use to push the price down. Lol so bad

its also 69,000 margin for a 5 dollar payout to sell those calls. Surely theres better uses for your margin.

2021-04-22 11:38:41,wallstreetbets,If I’m lucky... I’ll exercise the shares away from you!
2021-04-22 08:08:22,wallstreetbets,a cause? please. can't wait till you baboons are out of here.
2021-04-22 07:55:24,wallstreetbets,"There is no cause. I’m not in any team. I make my own decisions. 

I don’t really buy shares. Sometimes I buy 1 to track my options vs the underlying (autism), but I’d rather get deep ITM calls than shares"

2021-04-22 07:23:35,wallstreetbets,There we go. You understand my play. It’s been drawn out over many weeks.
2021-04-22 07:31:28,wallstreetbets,Not that bad?.....UVXY= phi beta kappa bad.  Unless your GS and you're shorting the piss outta that thing keep right on moving yo.

2021-04-22 19:02:36,wallstreetbets,"Oh I have plenty of those. But when I turned $800 into over $30k on calls when GME was $45... I started throw thousands at FDs and other positions

I want one more grand slam and then some FRO for the 30% dividend"
2021-04-22 07:27:23,wallstreetbets,"Trust me, I know. I just didn’t think GME would trade sideways for the last 2 weeks"
2021-04-22 11:35:43,wallstreetbets,Oh I know what I’m buying
2021-04-21 22:50:28,wallstreetbets,Yeah for the call writer

2021-04-22 07:32:54,wallstreetbets,Clearly you don’t understand options
2021-04-22 07:28:15,wallstreetbets,This WSB. Shares are for pussies
2021-04-22 07:26:50,wallstreetbets,Thank you kind sir!
2021-04-22 05:03:48,wallstreetbets,"There's a difference between a gamble and just simply throwing money away. Buying 0DTE SPY FD's is a respectable gamble and you can make loads of money for a strike 1-2% OTM. 

He's buying weeklies with strikes 100+ % OTM. It's just plain stupid. It's like buying 100,000 lottery tickets. Sure you could win if you pick right. But the odds aren't even remotely in your favor."
2021-04-22 07:36:21,wallstreetbets,I took profits when we hit $350 then managed to blow up my account buying weeklies
2021-04-22 07:23:02,wallstreetbets,Never
2021-04-21 23:09:44,wallstreetbets,Why would he exercise way out of the money calls.  That will make it a even more retarded play lol.
2021-04-21 23:34:59,wallstreetbets,You can't exercise OTM calls. Clearly you've never bought them before lmao.
2021-04-22 07:35:10,wallstreetbets,I have wrinkles but my play is literally keep buying weeklies til they hit
2021-04-22 05:04:49,wallstreetbets,Oh so it's July now. Got it. For some reason I had 3/19 and 4/20 circled because those were the last two dates which were supposed to be the squeeze. My mistake.
2021-04-22 05:56:53,wallstreetbets,"I don't, it seems to make one dangerously stupid."
2021-04-22 17:09:33,wallstreetbets,Oh I did sell and realize $30k profit. Just haven’t hit on any weeklies in a while
2021-04-22 16:51:55,wallstreetbets,"Wow, you really bought the hype."
2021-04-22 07:34:12,wallstreetbets,We could open our own Spac with his premiums
2021-04-22 11:49:54,wallstreetbets,"Well that's why you sell short covered calls but go long on buying calls. I make more consistent profits using their strategies. 

Not to say I don't enjoy buying a few FDs every now and then"
2021-04-22 07:53:03,wallstreetbets,"Hey I didn’t flair it as a YOLO, I’ll come back with a true YOLO one day soon"
2021-04-22 11:29:36,wallstreetbets,Hahah seriously. What a loser
2021-04-22 19:42:41,wallstreetbets,You don’t mess around.
2021-04-22 01:37:26,wallstreetbets,You ever hear of a covered call?
2021-04-22 08:05:28,wallstreetbets,"The ones selling it probably don't use normal margin. They're hedging with shares, but they don't need the full 100. That option has a delta of 0.0025. It's going to be a *long* time before they even need to buy a single share as collateral. And it's set to expire tomorrow."
2021-04-22 01:39:12,wallstreetbets,First of all shares would be cheaper collateral at only 15k/contract. 690 is 5x the current price and there is a week left. It's shocking they're even trading at $0.05
2021-04-22 08:07:36,wallstreetbets,Ever learn to read? He is buying calls.
2021-04-22 14:55:57,wallstreetbets,"Just wait until night! That way when you get there, it isnt too hot."

2021-04-22 19:00:11,wallstreetbets,"If GME hits $1000 like I think, any of those calls will be worth about $50,000 a pop

That’s why I just keep throwing money at it. At least one will hit and make me overall very profitable. Just took longer than expected and had to roll for losses for a while."
2021-04-22 14:16:14,wallstreetbets,Gladly! I need to get rid of some for profit eventually haha
2021-04-22 10:52:25,wallstreetbets,don’t worry they can all go to super stonk where they send citadel death threats and stalk their office in the middle of the night lmao

2021-04-22 19:05:21,wallstreetbets,GME is not something that one should count on. I would rather focus on something that would make a consistent return month in and month out. The financial market doesn't care what our wants or needs are.
2021-04-22 11:52:26,wallstreetbets,Turn your phone 90 degrees to the left and it’ll be mooning
2021-04-22 11:48:07,wallstreetbets,I’m honestly not convinced that you do
2021-04-22 07:51:24,wallstreetbets,I know that you are giving money directly to citadel every time you lose on your option bet when in reality if u just bought shares that would be a problem.
2021-04-22 07:35:58,wallstreetbets,What's the name of this sub?
2021-04-21 23:15:45,wallstreetbets,"Well he’d wait until they’re in the money to exercise them at such time the shares exceed the call’s strike, presumably during the big squeeze.  The only real reason I can think of to do this would be if the calls were illiquid and can’t be sold because nobody is buying them, so exercise and sell the shares would be the next best option.

In the first go-round the options were so messed up you’d make money off the expanding IV even if you picked wrong, and there was reportedly some trouble getting out of some of the options plays.   I assumed this was why op is buying weeklies now hoping it would squeeze on a Friday and exercise them, but my brain is pretty smooth so probably am wrong.

Either way it would save a lot of theta burn."
2021-04-22 10:54:23,wallstreetbets,"Or keep losing money indefinitely.

That too."
2021-04-22 11:26:36,wallstreetbets,Lol fuck off pussy

Sometimes I buy 1 to keep the stock on my radar or to track the underlying vs my options, but shares... nah I’d rather buy ITM calls over that.

This isn’t a cause or movement. I’m here to gamble."
2021-04-22 10:16:17,wallstreetbets,WSB is to make money on gambling. This ain’t UNICEF.

2021-04-22 19:11:55,wallstreetbets,No it wasn't buying in really to help a push. It was just buying in to make money. Learn options through and through before you waste money on them

I wouldn't do it anymore if the mathematical expectation is approaching negative. High risk, high return! All the power to you!"

2021-04-22 08:20:15,wallstreetbets,No I’ve done my research. Citadel is a god damn market maker. Every time you lose on an option they make money. It’s really not a hard concept to grasp.
2021-04-22 17:04:30,wallstreetbets,Which is the risk WE take.  Its not your risk.  It's my risk.
2021-04-21 23:30:32,wallstreetbets,"Hey I’m not advocating for it, I own my shares and may have sold him some of those calls.  Just trying to make some sense of the twisted logic that somehow made this seem like a good idea to someone in the first place.

2021-04-22 12:56:37,wallstreetbets,I don’t really read DD here. Data on fails to deliver and recent law changes make it very obvious what is about to occur.
2021-04-22 08:21:24,wallstreetbets,oh they are a market maker? did you just learn that word? lol
2021-04-22 17:25:36,wallstreetbets, That is just dumb logic. If everyone on this sub had that same viewpoint then no one would have any money.
2021-04-21 23:32:15,wallstreetbets,I don't know this seems like trying to hit the lotto here with such a low probability of working.  Or maybe sell it for a quick profit if it does run up on a good day.
2021-04-22 08:22:37,wallstreetbets,You’re just being arrogant at this point questioning my intelligence. Does it bother you that I am right?

2021-04-22 09:23:01,wallstreetbets,"What's funny is that this can really go multiple ways. If your engineer can communicate clearly and effectively, then yeah, having a business analyst is a COMPLETE waste as basically all they serve to do is waste your time explaining things to them. Things which they don't even understand, and so then you get stuck on client calls anyways which is one of the few things the business analyst is supposed to take care of so you don't have to. As one of those engineers, this frustrates the fuck out of me, but is also a huge reason why I've been promoted so much, so it kinda works out. Unfortunately, there are many engineers who can't communicate for shit. Many of them are trying their best, but there is only so much you can do when you aren't natively proficient in a language, and didn't start learning it until you were already starting adulthood. I'm not going to say they are stupid or they dont work hard, but fact of the matter is, if you cant effectively communicate in the native tongue of the country you live in, it is going to hold you back."

2021-04-22 01:50:45,wallstreetbets,"REAL DIAMOND HANDS ARE NOT THOSE WHO HELD UNTIL THE SQUEEZE. Its easy to hold when you're loosing, knowing the price HAS to squeeze sooner or later and you'll find yourself in profits. REAL DIAMOND HANDS are those holding DURING THE SQUEEZE, knowing they could call it a day, sell and take profits, but CONTINUE TO HOLD because not only 10M$/share is the floor and only THE FLOOR, but also because all of this is a war for a cause bigger than us, that we can win only by BEING COORDINATED and TRUSTING EACH OTHER. REAL DIAMOND HANDS are ready to see the price make 50% (or more) retracements from high prices such as 100k to 50k, 500k to 250k or more, WITHOUT PANICKING OR THINKING WE REACHED THE PEAK. Why? Because THE PRICE IS WRONG. We set the price. Forger your usual techincal analysis. ALL SHORTS MUST COVER. How? BY BUYING BACK FROM SELLERS, NO MATTER THE PRICE. 

Hold the fucking line. The hardest past IS NOT DONE YET, DON'T FUCKING DANCE. FLOOR IS 10M$. Apes are strong, but only together. Let's stay together."

2021-04-22 07:48:13,wallstreetbets,"Last year I saved most of my PTO until December and just took the last 3 weeks or so off. It was exactly like you describe, for like two weeks I did nothing, just rest and recuperation. Then in the last week, I set up a regular routine of exercise, yoga, meditation, and ritual work. It took a couple hours each day, but it was fun and beneficial, and I had plenty of energy to keep up with it.

In January, I went back to work, and briefly managed to keep it up. I had a great sleep schedule, 6pm-2am. That gave me several hours to do my routine in the morning when I had the energy, then I could go to work after. Eventually the sleep schedule deteriorated, routine got pushed to after work, then got later and later because I couldn't bring myself to do everything after getting off of 8 hours of whatever was happening at work.

January 27th was the last day I did the full routine, then my life returned to the previous shambling existence, with rare attempts to pick back up different parts of the system.

I'm working at a corporate job because a large company can provide a stable income, even if I put in like 50% effort, as I grow my savings towards my retirement number. Half a million dollars and I am free and clear to move to some low cost of living city and live the life I want to live. I sat down one day and typed out all the things I'm interested in looking into, and it's a [sizable list](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzz1mc/-/gq5w4d3). I don't understand people who say they'd be bored in retirement.

2021-04-22 16:13:21,wallstreetbets,">Corporate jobs like this are hardly creative or novel work.

Correct.  The work they are managing, however, creation of software, is creative and novel mental work.  

>And it's not designed to optimize management, it's designed to extract the most labour from a person in as possible without overworking them to where it costs more to replace qnd retrain them.

When talking about repetitive manufacturing labor, yes, that is what it was designed for.  As applied to mental work, it's simply a copy and paste job with no consideration for the differing capacities human beings have for prolonged mental effort as opposed to prolonged physical labor, the different importance of reducing interruptions, etc.  Of course the purpose is maximizing profit, and it is exceptionally poor at doing so.  The only reason such structures survive is because the work, software creation, is such an immense productivity multiplier that it manages to compensate.  If companies cared more about their fiduciary responsibility to act for shareholder profit, more than they care about propping up a dying model of the workplace and work that supports an expansive topheavy management class and their psychological need to feel useful, they might pay attention to things like the 1000+ scientific studies showing the destruction of productivity wrought by open floor plan offices, or the studies showing increased productivity in mental work jobs with shortened work hours, etc.  Instead, they ignore those things while pounding books written in the 1970s and 80s about managing manufacturing outfits."
2021-04-22 17:37:39,wallstreetbets,The idea of creating “shareholder value” has only been around since 1986 thanks to Alfred Rappapport. It’s just an idea that Wall Street has used to justify anything under the sun since then.

Im at the old end of the millennial range, nearly Gen X, so to me anyone born after 90 is basically a baby. The fact that the youngest is 30 just feels..weird. 

 And yeah, no one went to see office space in the theaters but we watched tf outta it on VHS/DVD. It wasn't like we ignored it completely and the youngest millennials/Gen Z kids were all ""Gimme!"" 20 years later or something and it only then became popular."

Let me tell you, the environment has literally sucked the life force out from me, and I have no more energy nor will to write any more code. But the biggest driver of moving to management was so I could get an office - it was a surreal feeling not having to constantly think about who is around, or feel like I’m being watched despite not doing anything other than my work. I **hate** that feeling.

Turns out, after I started this job, there are deliberate strategies by upper management passed down to us to make life less comfortable for employees. And I regularly eschew them whenever I can to ensure my team is as comfortable as possible. Things like no remote work, open floor plans, walking around to “get a pulse” of the employees. Fuck all that.

If there is one silver lining in this god-forsaken pandemic, it is that it forced *everyone* to work remotely. My management objected so much to it, but they had no choice. They are chomping at the bit to get back in the office. But in our yearly report, the CEO actually said “surprisingly, we were just as productive despite covid”. No shit, Sherlock"

2021-04-22 15:43:35,wallstreetbets,GME can do nothing for months like we have now. Maybe the occasional sharp rise or fall. Options are just gambling.
2021-04-22 18:36:26,wallstreetbets,"Something to look at, Marriott just finished their purchase of Westin, Sheraton and Hyatt vacation club. Their stock rose with that purchase higher than last year's numbers. Hilton just bought in conjuction with another large Vacation ownership In Diamond resorts , they surpassed Marriott total property availability by 40 resorts. I'm wondering why Hilton stock is so low in comparison to Marriott. Marriott is at 176 with a 52 week high of 188. Hilton is at 43 with a high of 43.50.  I personally think Hilton will surpass its future evaluated high of 53.50 when they start reporting their international sales numbers again. Above 60 would be my guess. Get it while you can.."

Following someone who made a play when it was 10-12 dollars a share and now making millions and you’re over here buying a stock that is way over valued thinking it’s gonna make you rich. You deserve to lose you money lol. GameStop is gonna be another blockbuster and that’s that. The smart ones are riding the waves and making the money they can till it tanks. You think the chairman’s at GameStop are going to invest everything they have in this? You’re fucking dumb. Donate your money to charity, it will be of better use."

2021-04-22 03:20:26,wallstreetbets,Just buy shares?
2021-04-22 03:20:36,wallstreetbets,Seriously if you’re still buying options on robinhood you deserve to lose all your money. (Not sure that that is robinhood tho)
2021-04-22 03:29:55,wallstreetbets,Pro tip: Just put a vertical line through those minus signs and you got yourself some grade AAA gains. Thank me later.
2021-04-22 03:31:46,wallstreetbets,Don't trade options on GME ffs.

2021-04-22 07:22:31,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands or selling?

2021-04-22 08:54:23,wallstreetbets,It’ll pop. We’re all rooting for you
2021-04-22 09:19:02,wallstreetbets,"Okay so I'm a little retarded but I think I have it so (in the top option) if GME goes to $280 today or tomorrow you could buy it at $200 a share and you would be buying 9,000shares.? And you either paid $128.70 or $12,870  for the contract. I'm assuming it's $128.70 because $12,870 is a huge risk for not much reward(just did the math it's a $720,000 profit so I guess it is a pretty big reward. But who would pay that seems like you have better Vegas odds.) So from what I think I know this would be an FD since it expires soon unless he bought it a long time ago and is just now showing us the expiration date. Can someone help me out let me know if I'm right or wrong"
2021-04-22 09:47:09,wallstreetbets,plenty of time left!  maybe change your attitude!
2021-04-22 10:00:28,wallstreetbets,That’s just you being an idiot. Nothing to do with the chair-man.

2021-04-22 08:23:05,wallstreetbets,"First, you should be in robinhood and second. Why not just buy shares?"
2021-04-22 12:53:56,wallstreetbets,Wsb compromised retards only allowing loss porn but anything else about GME is deleted

2021-04-22 08:59:12,wallstreetbets,"You do know diamond handing only works for shares, not contracts right? time decay tomorrow means even if they are slightly ITM you'll still be at a loss.

2021-04-22 07:19:47,wallstreetbets,You should buy shares and sell CCs to recoup your losses.

2021-04-21 20:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Very much F***** unless GME 🚀before 4pm Friday.
OP bought 190 call contracts (mixed strike price of 200 or 250). 
Which means if GME doesn’t hit 200 or higher on Friday OP will lose $120.000. He could have sold today for $20.000 maybe sell for $5-10.000 tomorrow or just pray for a miracle and make a quarter million on Friday..."

2021-04-22 10:16:33,wallstreetbets, Bro - missing a 0. He spent $120k
2021-04-22 11:58:34,wallstreetbets,Thanks! But now I’m a little confused with how he spent 120k. If I do the math would it be (90 buys * $143) + (100 buys * $77) = about $20000? How did he spend $120k? Or are those numbers (the 1.43 and 0.77) just how much those contracts are worth currently? Not how much he initially paid for the contracts.
2021-04-21 21:23:54,wallstreetbets,"I have shares too, but when the cat doubles down I go all the way in"
2021-04-21 22:17:08,wallstreetbets,Correction stupid for not buying options on dips. My 135 call is looking amazing considering for Friday!
2021-04-21 22:53:59,wallstreetbets,"Believe it or not, both are retarded"
2021-04-22 08:44:23,wallstreetbets,And still being on rh
2021-04-22 10:07:06,wallstreetbets,This is WSB. We didn’t know what shares were until 3 months ago.

2021-04-22 07:20:07,wallstreetbets,Or be broke and die..

2021-04-22 07:49:20,wallstreetbets,Adding shares in your honor !
2021-04-22 07:46:56,wallstreetbets,Health concerns. He likes the stock. He hopes it goes to $500 and beyond in the next few weeks. He hates money.
2021-04-22 12:07:51,wallstreetbets,😂 right underneath the lift off pad

2021-04-22 17:31:12,wallstreetbets,You made me actually LOL with that one
2021-04-22 17:50:15,wallstreetbets,Hahaha I laughed out loud at this
2021-04-22 06:51:34,wallstreetbets,Rocket already took off twice lol
2021-04-21 22:31:18,wallstreetbets,But every call that expires worthless is funding the entities you are hoping to squeeze
2021-04-21 23:26:45,wallstreetbets,This has been my strategy but ive been buying spy calls to get more gme shares instead.
2021-04-22 14:59:51,wallstreetbets,Welp. Looks like you are.
2021-04-22 12:40:10,wallstreetbets,"Young one? Lol you're a. Lying about your position.  B. Fucked. Those contracts are down 60% today alone and theta are that ass. So unless you bought them at yesterday's close, and sold at open your down a good 30k right now, which is probably like 300 bucks because we all know your lying about your position"
2021-04-21 21:58:46,wallstreetbets,"Wow,  I'm surprised they're worth anything right now with the expiration date so close and being close to 100 pts from the strike. 

But who knows,  GME makes some big moves.    Apparently 400 shares were purchased after hours for $258 tonight....so there is that."
2021-04-21 23:38:00,wallstreetbets,"Errr your math is off dude. If GME hits $175 tomorrow AND vol spikes to 500% your calls will be worth somewhere around $300-$400 each, depending on time of day and other variables."
2021-04-22 00:57:47,wallstreetbets,"Um, math"
2021-04-21 23:41:07,wallstreetbets,Only the sith jerk off to absolutes
2021-04-22 05:13:51,wallstreetbets,"It's a rollercoaster for sure, when I'm finally done, I'm gonna upload a screenshot of my account balance through the year, win or lose."
2021-04-21 21:59:02,wallstreetbets,"you are right

2021-04-22 16:01:48,wallstreetbets,"This should be a solid signal that managing your own money is not for you. In just one week, you managed to lose the amount of wealth that would normally take an average US worker 2 years of full time work to create. On a bet that probably a 10 year old could tell you was not smart. I’m hoping this is your play money and you have a professional managing your real portfolio. 

Although, this is why society is somewhat lucky that generation wealth is very hard to attain and continue to pass on. Eventually, it gets to someone who didn’t work for it (does not realize the value of it) and does not know how to manage it properly. On the bright side this capital is now in the hands of someone who is much better at allocating it."

2021-04-22 11:06:07,wallstreetbets,Yeah but he exercised the options. Bought the underlying stock for 12 dollars. He didn’t go out and buy more options is what I’m saying. Of course he had huge gains with those options. They were 12 dollar calls. Every share out in the market is a god damn fake.
2021-04-22 10:52:10,wallstreetbets,You don’t get it. He had that kind of money to burn in the first place. He will be fine my dude.

I was under the impression $250.77 break even on the one and $201.43 on the other. That's the price per share, and he buys 100 of them, so if the price goes to $250.77, that's $2,256,930, of which $2.25mil is shares and $6,930 is contract cost.

2021-04-21 23:17:03,wallstreetbets,But if the idea is that they have shorted more than the float supply isn't the issue. It is their capital and ability to avoid margin call.
2021-04-22 08:03:00,wallstreetbets,You think he's the only one thinking that way? It's the collective amount of all people like that that are significant and not a drop in the bucket.
2021-04-22 01:26:17,wallstreetbets,Because of spread? Not much you can do about that. At least after that you have your shares and they don't. Whereas expired calls they have your money and you don't.

2021-04-22 16:00:39,wallstreetbets,"I thought that each contract holds 100 shares, hence $0.77 * 100 = $77 and since both are calls, to break even he'd need the highest call to exceed it's calculated value. I don't even know how options are priced?"

2021-04-22 08:34:08,wallstreetbets,Yes but he cant control what they do and nor can you.
2021-04-22 01:29:17,wallstreetbets,Guess who earns the spread
2021-04-22 09:18:54,wallstreetbets,100% of the time it works in the opposite way to the other 90% of the time which is correlated with the movement of the remaining 10% of the time which functions as a direct inverse of 100% of the time
2021-04-22 18:13:12,wallstreetbets,B R U H
2021-04-22 16:40:20,wallstreetbets,"So the reason it's a break even is because you want to earn $0.01 profit if the call was exercised.

If the call is exercised, you must buy 100 shares at $250 each, that's $25,000 total in shares.

The contract cost you $0.77 each, so 100x$0.77 = $77.

All-in, that exercised contract costs $25,077.

If the stock price is exactly $250.00, then you're in the hole because you spent $25,077.00 on 100 shares that are only worth $25,000.00.

So it's $250.77 break even, since $250.78 would result in buying 100 shares at one penny cheaper than you paid for them after you factor in the contract cost.

Now if the contract was far more expensive, say $30, you spent $3,000 and your break even is $280.00 per share."
2021-04-21 23:58:23,wallstreetbets,Balls of steel brother. Take a step back and realize only 60% of the week has gone by. 40% is a lot of time to have left
2021-04-22 01:30:42,wallstreetbets,"Isn't it clear based on my reply that I am aware of who earns the spread? My point is there is no avoiding it, but you still end up with a share that they need to buy back. Where as with expired calls that's it. They won and got your money."
2021-04-22 18:17:22,wallstreetbets,"That’s like a 60 b market cap.

It’s easily going to 10k, 600b market cap. Could have saved some cash on the premium and bought more contracts."

2021-04-22 00:01:05,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but the 100k loss is tangible regardless. Even if they do print, their growth would be from the 20k of their current value to their future value. Because the 100k loss represents an opportunity cost that I paid that would not exist if I paid for these same options at end of day on Wednesday. That being said, I didn't hear no bell."
2021-04-22 01:37:13,wallstreetbets,"They already won when people didn't sell back in January during the infinity squeeze.

Any px now is a result of GME being illiquid. It's why that stock is so easily manipulated.

They've almost certainly made any losses back accumulated from Melvin's debt out already. Citadel's a market maker, their entire bit is staying delta neutral."
2021-04-22 01:44:02,wallstreetbets,"January was not an infinity squeeze. It was cut off at the fucking ankles. Nobody was even margin called at that point. You are welcome to believe whatever you like, but to me it seems glaringly obvious they didn't cover. If they did you wouldn't have read ""forget GameStop"" every day for the past 3 months from every market news team that gives out dog shit suggestions. The SEC wouldn't be putting out all these laws with how to deal with a catastrophic, unmanageable squeeze. They would just focus on preventing new ones from happening if that was their goal. And I'm not even going to bother going into any DD. Has Citadel made money manipulating GME since January? I would imagine so. Does that mean they have covered? Fuck no."

I'm not going to speak to what you should buy, but more about what will suffer or do well.

Any commodities like oil, gas, steel, timber, etc. Current my being exported will be blockaded and contracts with the EU will be suspended. The moment Russia crosses the border into Ukraine under their own flag and he US will enlist the air of NATO and will ask it's Pacific allies to cease trade with Russia. Russia will be bottled at all three sides and trade will grind to a halt. 

So puts on any major industries that exports out of Russia. Calls on any businesses that can fill that gap. 

While defense contractors in the US will get a bump it won't be because of fundamentals but patriotic sentiment. Most of the equipment to be used in a war has already been built and sold and thus priced in. So, short term calls on defense contractors whose products seem to be in the news most. Wait for the next defense bill to see whose actually getting new contracts before taking long positions."

What we would se if an invasion occurs is that there will be economical sanctions and the rubel will tank. So there might be a short play on the entire russian economy in that case.

Personally i don't think this is more than hot air. We might se a few border skirmishes so that Putin can distract his people at home from domestic issues. If invading ukraine was in russias best interest it would have made more sense to do it at the same time as taking crimea. But im not an expert."

Really anything American or American partnered that specializes in materials and engineering is going to be good. Mining and industrials would be good plays too because the US would try to centralize where they get their products from and that means big subsidies to those sectors to produce more.

2021-04-21 21:25:10,wallstreetbets,Ukraine does not have a invite to nato because they cannot pay.... Now with the US shift of forces to Poland and other cold war lines in the last few years and arming of Ukrainian forces there are extra staging points of gear and US personal.  Putin is playing chess with a newly sitting president that he annexed Crimea under as a VP with no retaliation.. so that said.. if he goes for it  which is slim to none... Then  Biden will have to go for it. Putin acts strongly but does not have the actual forces to invade against Nato at this time IMO.

2021-04-22 10:43:28,wallstreetbets,"But ceding from Ukraine was. The legislation body brought the ballot provision forward. This was an aspect of them voting to leave Ukraine. The Crimea was overwhelmingly in favor of the the government that had been overthrown. Then Ukraine was waging war against its own civilians in the east. Crimea understood what was coming for them if they didn’t agree with the western overthrow of the elected government.

This issue was brought on by the EU and the US. Had we stayed out, this issue would have possibly a different outcome.

The Donbas region was overwhelming Russian friendly and the driver of economic output in the country. They and Crimea had overwhelmingly voted for the government in that was overthrown. 

I call a spade a spade, I know people don’t like it. But had NATO stayed out, this would have not happened. Many people have died over Natos belligerence."

If it wasn't for the American hegemony after WW2, Europe would have been under the influence of a Soviet hegemony. And more than likely European soldiers would still be sent out to die for another country's cause/objective, except this in this scenario, the KGB would be disappearing any protestors or anyone with an opposing viewpoint.

But then again, sending other people to die for your country is a tale as old as humanity. Hell, the French Foreign Legion popularized it."

The breakeven on the $25 is only a 212% increase from close, versus the $30 breakeven that needs a 250% increase. I don’t think the added risk to reward (especially since I think hitting $40 to begin with is ludicrous) is worth buying anything over a $15c. 833% gains versus 816% gains, and the lower the price from $40 at expiration the more disproportionate the 15c’s returns will be compared to the 30c’s."

2021-04-21 21:48:00,wallstreetbets,"With MVIS being on the verge on releasing their A-Sample results this month (not too many days left in April) and the recent high short interest on the stock.  What are your ideas on a potential squeeze in the event they release successful PR on the A Sample.

IMO it seems to be a win/win if you’re willing to hold.

“Best in class” tech, multiple verticals, already working with key players in VR/AR, checks all the boxes for buyout on the way, PLUS the short interest.  

Is this a perfect storm?"
2021-04-21 21:19:37,wallstreetbets,Any shares under $15 is a complete steal Imo when you consider the future of this company

2021-04-21 23:03:52,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. If you're skeptical I would atleast start a small position. We're waiting for the press release of our Lidar A sample to be complete. That's the catalyst that caused us to run to $24 in the first place on just news of being on track for April but the market has killed mid caps recently. This is disruptive technology that you have a chance at getting in on early
2021-04-21 23:01:50,wallstreetbets,I bought at 18 and averaged down to 14. I highly suggest reading the DD on the Microvision subreddit. This is more then a squeeze. This company will be bought out

2021-04-22 10:28:52,wallstreetbets,I bought in at 22 in feb after DD and advice from  people who’d been following for much longer. Have since averaged down to 15. This is still absolutely a good time to buy. Holding tight onto baby mavis and buying more and more with every dip.

2021-04-21 20:58:22,wallstreetbets,I have been “Stealing” this for months now. Bags getting heavy if that getaway car doesn’t show up soon!
2021-04-21 21:11:58,wallstreetbets,It ran up before earnings last time cause rocket was going up AND they did their dividend around that time too.
2021-04-21 20:42:55,wallstreetbets,Loaded up more today. Bargain basement prices.
2021-04-21 20:51:15,wallstreetbets,This thing is a fucking bull trap. Every time I try I end up losing big
2021-04-21 21:07:40,wallstreetbets,Finally bought in today.  Felt like it was too good to pass up.  Immediately sold cc's for a little income.  Let's go boys!
2021-04-21 20:51:59,wallstreetbets,They are crushing right now.  Rates back in the 2s. Q1 I suspect was their best quarter ever.  Q2 off to a solid start I loaded a ton of new deals the past 2 weeks and they are all going UWM.  Nobody else is even close on price/speed/service
2021-04-21 20:38:42,wallstreetbets,What be nice to see some green days for a change.
2021-04-21 21:29:09,wallstreetbets,"Fool me once... you ain’t gonna fool me again. 

You might...

Buying at open."
2021-04-22 10:03:43,wallstreetbets,"It’s the poet hands on WSB that have kept this down. Buy and hold. At this price you get 5.5% on your money in dividend alone. Should have 2 back to back blow out quarters. I’m 70,000 shares strong."
2021-04-22 10:40:58,wallstreetbets,**I HOLD MY BAG OF UWMC AND WAIT IT WILL INCREASE AS THE COMPANY'S TREND IS POSITIVE**
2021-04-21 22:56:22,wallstreetbets,Right behind you good sir.
2021-04-21 22:47:33,wallstreetbets,I like the stock but I like RKT better.. I own both
2021-04-21 21:02:00,wallstreetbets,YMCA? 🤔
2021-04-22 00:54:08,wallstreetbets,What is the max amount of times one should ever buy the dip? Asking for a friend.
2021-04-22 08:18:01,wallstreetbets,LETS FUCKING GOOO !!!! Price Target 15 $
2021-04-22 19:51:39,wallstreetbets,"I agree that I think the market has this wrong and they will have blowout earnings (again). Rumors of refinancing’s demise is greatly exaggerated. 

In the meantime, I’m happy to collect a 5.38% dividend on a stock with a forward PE under 7. 

Remember too that the float is just a tiny fraction of the shares outstanding so when this gets a positive catalyst it could really jump. 

Fuck it, I just convinced myself to buy more."
2021-04-21 20:34:35,wallstreetbets,Paging r/chargeyourphone
2021-04-21 21:29:46,wallstreetbets,There's Russell inclusion rumors
2021-04-22 01:16:19,wallstreetbets,Ok say no more
2021-04-22 03:50:31,wallstreetbets,My calls be chilling at minus 95 with a month to expiry. What do I have to lose by waiting longer
2021-04-22 07:39:02,wallstreetbets,"This seems like a bull trap. People keep saying it’ll run up on for earnings, but it really hasn’t done much except go down for months"
2021-04-22 10:55:59,wallstreetbets,Grabbed a few shares...yolo
2021-04-22 11:16:13,wallstreetbets,I’m in
2021-04-22 11:46:36,wallstreetbets,Damn
2021-04-22 14:49:03,wallstreetbets,"I am bleeding on this stock.  I bought high of course at an avg of 10.71.  In February.  

I guess I should buy some more than"
2021-04-22 15:20:25,wallstreetbets,His battery is low from buying so many UWMC shares.
2021-04-22 17:37:29,wallstreetbets,Pretty cute that 100% of your posts are about uwmc. Are you an employee ?
2021-04-22 18:42:15,wallstreetbets,Got my calls in today 🚀
2021-04-21 21:25:39,wallstreetbets,#i can see why you want it to run. We ain't holding your bags 🤡
2021-04-22 02:42:41,wallstreetbets,Pipe dream
2021-04-22 08:28:56,wallstreetbets,MVIS is the way
2021-04-22 14:57:49,wallstreetbets,Its a trap
2021-04-21 21:17:43,wallstreetbets,Agreed.  Seems like forever ago when I bought in at 7.70.
2021-04-21 22:43:42,wallstreetbets,Where’s Baby Driver when you need him???
2021-04-21 21:27:41,wallstreetbets,You’re due for a win
2021-04-21 20:57:50,wallstreetbets,"I’m not saying you’re wrong... but if UWMC has been killing it all quarter, then why hasn’t its stock reflected this? It’s been red for like 2 months straight. And it’s supposed to all of sudden wake everyone up once ER hits???"
2021-04-22 07:53:35,wallstreetbets,"I had a loan through Rocket and tried to refinance. 

A loan officer using UWM saved me $4k at closing and was much more pleasant than Rocket."
2021-04-22 00:56:27,wallstreetbets,I couldn't decide which bag to buy. So i bought both as well.
2021-04-22 01:23:30,wallstreetbets,"Is there a max amount of times you should dip your spoon into the gravy?! 
I. Think. Not!"
2021-04-21 20:39:06,wallstreetbets,"As long as it's charged before earnings so OP can sell right beforehand, they'll be fine."
2021-04-21 22:47:06,wallstreetbets,There was a while back too. Then it wasn’t included and it kinda ... fell.
2021-04-21 22:46:17,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t give you the Birkin I’m going to stuff all my shares in if my life depended on it. Shit you probably don’t even know what a Birkin is.
2021-04-21 23:34:35,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-04-21 22:19:07,wallstreetbets,Fuck it. I’m in. 100 calls tomorrow
2021-04-21 21:33:02,wallstreetbets,I had my best quarter ever as a loan officer on track to do 30% more than my best year ever.  Stock is being trampled by short sellers and negativity towards rates rising margin compression.  They say rates are going up but there is no guarantee this recovery continues.   Rest of the developed world has crazy low rates even negative rates.
2021-04-22 10:18:41,wallstreetbets,Rocket has been overshadowing them because they are customer facing and more known to retail investors. UWMC customers are the brokers themselves to which they are dumping money into their stock. I was on the phone the other day with a broker to which he said he loves their software and that Rocket mortgage steals their customers if they interact with them. Not great business practices but it puts numbers on the board. I'm holding.
2021-04-21 21:42:17,wallstreetbets,They haven't released their numbers yet... In fact they have never released a quarterly... Sooo that's why.
2021-04-21 22:40:57,wallstreetbets,Because it’s been shorted like crazy and a lot of that will be coming to an end starting tomorrow with new regulations the SEC has out into place. This is a market wide change. You will see a great deal of stocks (especially small and mid caps) slowly climb up between now and the end of May. The bartender just yelled last call on uncovered shorts.
2021-04-22 19:47:38,wallstreetbets,Same here
2021-04-22 00:17:24,wallstreetbets,I believe it was an error on Russell's side. They weren't eligible Q1
2021-04-22 10:26:26,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-22 14:33:44,wallstreetbets,lmk how it goes ape
2021-04-21 21:38:09,wallstreetbets,"Copy that! 
I’ve got shares aka BAGS! Lol. So I’m definitely watching? 

Might have to either make things worse or some good money on some calls. When is ER?"
2021-04-22 12:06:01,wallstreetbets,How do I become a loan officer?
2021-04-21 22:56:43,wallstreetbets,All I hear is “bartender just called BOGO on UWMC MAY 21 calls”
2021-04-22 07:55:55,wallstreetbets,"No. Russell inclusion happens once per year. It CAN happen quarterly for IPOs... but UWMC was a SPAC, not an IPO, and therefore was not eligible to be added in Q1. It will almost certainly be added to the preliminary list at the end of May."
2021-04-22 02:19:15,wallstreetbets,"Russell said that float was too low, but according to UWMC that’s not true. Here’s to hoping they clear that up for next time."
2021-04-22 15:07:13,wallstreetbets,Sold my 7.50 calls just now for a quick 2k
2021-04-21 21:45:02,wallstreetbets,10 year approaching 1.53 tonight.  Might break 1.50 which would be a big move
2021-04-21 22:32:48,wallstreetbets,Before May 10th for sure. Read a number of places it will be May 5th.
2021-04-22 14:21:31,wallstreetbets,"Also it's added to Russel index on may 8.

Two close catalysts. It's gonna moon."
2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,FSR YOLO 
2021-04-21 20:19:17,wallstreetbets,I thought they were a scissor company!?
2021-04-21 20:43:04,wallstreetbets,Retarded YOLO
2021-04-21 21:15:43,wallstreetbets,"I bought when they were 17 dollars. Watched it go up 40% and down 40%. Holding long because I, personally, would buy their SUV (Ocean) if/when it goes in production."
2021-04-21 20:36:14,wallstreetbets,"I'm actually bearish on this one, read through plenty of good DD (the kind that was being drowned out bcuz fuck bears amirite?) that keeps me from getting calls on this one. I'm long RIDE and even SOLO but in the current year, I'm Smoky on this ticker chief

E: forgot to congrats you on the gains. Hopefully I'm wrong and you collect more tendies to come"
2021-04-22 02:47:05,wallstreetbets,Good luck!  This is a polarizing stock.  Many people hate the company others are willing to take a gamble.
2021-04-21 20:27:13,wallstreetbets,"I had been eyeing FSR and I felt I missed the boat, as it hit 13 I also started buying shares. I have 1300 shares averaged at 12.88 as well. Looking forward to the weeks to come. This company has a lot of potential to be a major competitor with Tesla through the partner ships they have created."
2021-04-21 20:46:12,wallstreetbets,Sounds like I’m in the right place
2021-04-21 21:25:05,wallstreetbets,Hard to watch but good decision
2021-04-21 20:37:34,wallstreetbets,"There’s a lot of smoke in all of these companies that are very new, I understand I’m jumping into a speculation for sure. But I do like this one. I’m keeping an eye on ride too"
2021-04-21 20:28:03,wallstreetbets,"Looking really good dude. Hope this continues to blow up. 

Congrats on your gains so far!"
2021-04-21 20:46:52,wallstreetbets,"I'm not an insider, but i know you should take your money and put it somewhere else. Just saying."
2021-04-21 20:36:21,wallstreetbets,Thanks looking forward to see where this goes
2021-04-21 20:47:40,wallstreetbets,Bipolar what did you bet on to lose that first 6k? I was in the hole 15k at one point took a miniyte to dig my self out of it
2021-04-21 20:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Btw, i didn't notice those were weeklys. So nevermind my retarded response.
We don't read, you should know that."
2021-04-21 20:50:20,wallstreetbets,What first 6k?
2021-04-21 20:50:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah feels safer being further out, I would’ve exited a weekly today for sure. I’m setting a 2 weeks hold on this. I’ve had much better outcome choosing my hold by time frame. 

The loss I saw you posted along time ago."
2021-04-21 20:51:34,wallstreetbets,"Which one ? Lol

Edit : there are so many"
2021-04-21 20:52:17,wallstreetbets,Damnn LOL I just felt that one too. “Which one” realest words I’ve heard all day.
2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,10 million strong 
2021-04-21 21:24:26,wallstreetbets,"You're early, like most of the time when I buy weekly call options."
2021-04-21 23:04:06,wallstreetbets,9.8 million* and about 7ish million of those came from GME.. for historical purposes.
2021-04-21 22:59:43,wallstreetbets,Subscriber go up. Average IQ go down (somehow lol).
2021-04-21 23:34:31,wallstreetbets,Ok I’m out of the loop... but what the fuck is a pokimane?
2021-04-22 04:11:14,wallstreetbets,"My God. I remember when this sub was a niche corner of reddit, a cornerstone of gambling for those who wanted to gamble without going to a casino. WSBGod, ControlTheNarrative, Analfarmer... here's to more retards doing more retarded things"
2021-04-22 07:45:50,wallstreetbets,"It's a sign. We're doomed.

Edit: called it."
2021-04-21 21:57:17,wallstreetbets,"On an unrelated note, what is the location pictured? I swear I recognize it from a Splinter Cell game.."
2021-04-22 09:14:38,wallstreetbets,Good old WSB. Be cautious here. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
2021-04-22 09:31:49,wallstreetbets,"It’s mostly GME people but since wsb is compromised, that number will decay over time again"

2021-04-22 13:43:30,wallstreetbets,Last time she showed up she crashed the markets
2021-04-21 21:49:29,wallstreetbets,I would love to have her back if we could go back to that subscriber count too
2021-04-21 20:25:24,wallstreetbets,She looks like my big toe
2021-04-22 04:55:38,wallstreetbets,Is pokimane Gucci Manes Pokémon?

2021-04-22 06:02:12,wallstreetbets,"this was actually a decent place (even if it was filled by degenerate gamblers) to get some niche news on niche stocks and see those niche yolos. Now it is GME, GME, conspiracy theories about GME, AMC, AMC and some sprinkling of BB and PLTR.

last year, just to name a few, pltr, gme, nio, prpl, psth, tsla, xpeg, edit , some guy showed his never failing spy put strategy etc etc. There was so much to see and do and as crazy as it sounds, learn here.

it's a shame what this place came to"

2021-04-21 20:21:47,wallstreetbets,"I think she is mostly just a twitch streamer. 
  
But I think the undertone of this conversation we're having implies that, after a certain level of fame, famous twitch streamers major fanbases are pretty much just waiting for the individual streamer to lose the clothes. 
  
Feel free to do an explicit search on her! Let us know what you find!?"

2021-04-21 22:20:53,wallstreetbets,Lol we're almost twins. As far as  cost per share.
2021-04-21 20:46:24,wallstreetbets,I would say you are far from being a bag holder. Your average cost is lower than 98% of us. Don't expect this to move too crazy for about two weeks or more. It does have a large short position which will likely cover before revenues that we already know will be a blowout. Would be foolish not to.
2021-04-21 23:32:23,wallstreetbets,I called the bottom today
2021-04-22 11:45:36,wallstreetbets,5200 shares at 8.80 checking in ... bag holders team meetup .. next Friday pizza and soda will be served !!!
2021-04-21 20:02:04,wallstreetbets,"This isn't bag holding bro, with those numbers you're just passing the bag"
2021-04-21 22:35:53,wallstreetbets,Holding 2600 shares at ~$7.80. It’ll start moving soon it just needs a catalyst. With earnings early May and a likely Russel inclusion following we’ve got our catalysts on the way.
2021-04-21 23:21:08,wallstreetbets,Holding 500 shares and 29 contracts that expire 5/21 hoping that earnings treat us well🤞
2021-04-22 01:01:13,wallstreetbets,"I thought I can't lose being in at 8.00.

2021-04-22 11:47:43,wallstreetbets,Congrats
2021-04-21 20:17:55,wallstreetbets,"You couldn't be more wrong. It's a deep value play, with the stock really low on basically nothing. Holding shares gets you a *great* dividend, and leaps are a solid play because the book value of the company is ~.09 above the current price. There's no guarantee of some meme stock spike, but this will be one that people will be kicking themselves in 5 years thinking ""why didn't I buy at $7?"""
2021-04-21 20:42:53,wallstreetbets,"It has only been trading for four months. You can't even compare rocket and UWMC. Might as well compare McDonald's to Red Robin. Price doesn't matter either. Market cap does. They are both number 1 in their channel. UWMC has a lower risk profile so when defaults from the shutdown finally happen, Rocket will feel it, UWMC won't. Rocket is also going to drop off big when refinancing dies down as that is a major part of their business. Their cost per acquisition is also much higher as they have to advertise heavily to get their customers. UWMC requires little to no marketing because they use brokers. One company is already valued pretty fairly, one is under value. Makes sense to invest in the one that is undervalued, not the one already trading high."

That said, I got the impression that their back end services were brittle and struggling to handle the scale they were projecting. Something I'm pretty familiar with.

2021-04-21 20:44:58,wallstreetbets,Viac was up almost 10% today.  Archegos getting liquidated drove that down.  This one is different unless there is a HF driving it up on massive margin?
2021-04-21 21:50:02,wallstreetbets,May work depends if the share price stays up and doesn't correct back to the mean.
2021-04-21 21:03:32,wallstreetbets,"I doubt it, the market cap is just small. It’s early and most people aren’t aware they’ve even gone public"

2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,VIAC YOLO update. The shorties are finally running and it’s time for the bulls to shine. 
2021-04-22 03:20:45,wallstreetbets,"That's a rough one but if fear of another block sell were keeping people from piling in (+shorts), it might spike up quickly. I've been trying to hear our the bear case, but haven't heard much that seems convincing thus far. Hopefully, today starts this run. I might buy a few lottery tickets at the same expiry/strike tomorrow."
2021-04-22 00:37:40,wallstreetbets,Super poor ape here but aside from my gamestonk shares im all in! Good luck! I really like the news coming out about VIAC and it should provide a really nice earnings.

2021-04-21 22:04:33,wallstreetbets,Good for you Ape...nothing burns more tendies than a wife that missed her period.
2021-04-21 22:34:52,wallstreetbets,"I know I sound like an idiot, but how did you make money, even when the stock price went down on specific days?"
2021-04-21 21:40:18,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's the dream man.... that's the dream.
2021-04-21 20:12:20,wallstreetbets,The Bro.
2021-04-21 21:51:19,wallstreetbets,Well they refinanced me yesterday and I'm on here. So there's that.
2021-04-21 21:39:17,wallstreetbets,Second this.  Holding too.
2021-04-22 07:07:06,wallstreetbets,Been waiting for the perfect storm
2021-04-21 23:08:52,wallstreetbets,"But you bought weeklies lol. 

Still I think you can hit somehow. Maybe another dividend announcement?"
2021-04-21 22:08:36,wallstreetbets,LMAO
2021-04-21 23:01:19,wallstreetbets,"I personally didn't, I just kept bleeding. Technically you could have bought puts to make money and days it went down, or sold and rebought, or even short sold. That's generally gambling and since I've usually lost more money by jumping in and out of a high conviction trade then if I had just stayed in the first place, I try not to do it.  
If you're talking about the green you see in my post, that's just the Daily Profit/Loss. It means the price went up by that much today (after they announced an earnings release date), but my position overall is still in the red.  
Some of the options I purchased today in anticipation of the earnings release,  however, I don't recommend options on this stock because it seems to be manipulated down. Shares are the way to go...which most of my position is. Or long term options also...problem is if every Tom, Dick, and Harry is buying options (both short and long term) then the stock could be pinned down forever and everyone gets fucked."
2021-04-21 23:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Cool, how was  your experience with them? I was just talking to my brother about them and he's buying some stock and is planning to use them to finance his new home."
2021-04-21 23:12:26,wallstreetbets,"Haha, I know, I know. I can't resist, but the bulk of it is in shares and I got some LEAPS in there.  


Edit: And we're just speculating on the lowered guidance. I think with the publicity they're received on WSB, they'll take market share at a faster pace. I'm already seen some posts on r/realestate about people being recommended Quicken Loans from their investor friend...little pieces here and there. Maybe I'm just biased."
2021-04-22 00:55:44,wallstreetbets,That's wisdom right there
2021-04-21 23:06:07,wallstreetbets,"Alright, thanks for the explanation, and I'll take your nugget of advice on this one."
2021-04-22 11:24:49,wallstreetbets,lol they should take a significant share in opendoor. good synergy. sell the mortgage and the house.
2021-04-22 06:34:20,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, it's was ridiculously easy. Filled out everything Saturday, Monday sent in all the documents they needed and spoke to them on the phone, yesterday the appraiser came to value the house. They move quick. I'm impressed."
2021-04-22 00:10:12,wallstreetbets,"Looks like RKT and UWMC are both undervalued at the moment. So many people are doing business through these services now. Profits are robust and the growth potential is also huge.


Really just a question of when sentiment will change."
2021-04-21 23:16:01,wallstreetbets,"Good Luck my friend.  


Not a pro/ not financial advice."

Stand in the market... Near them, on the exchange,

Half sunk a shattered stonk lies, whose volume,

And reported earning, and sneer of market cap,

Tell that its holders well those passions read

Which yet survive, typed on these lifeless things,

The bears that mocked them, and the gains that fed;

And in the description, these words appear:

My name is Palantir Technologies, FAANG of FAANGs;

Look on my Works, ye might, and despair!

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare

The lone and level charts stretch far away.”"

JMIA has slid from 66 to 30 since Feb 10, currently sitting on a support level, if it breaks below, it's still a good short.  I am also Bullish on AAPL, but I don't understand WTF it's doing.

2021-04-22 03:44:05,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is shit. Toyota sells 15 million  cars per year and has a market cap of 220 billion usd.  Why should Tesla, at present, be worth 3 times more, despite Toyota selling 30 times as many cars as Tesla?  Makes a lot of sense...

There will never be enough customers to buy 15 million Teslas. That's not going to happen.  The new EVs from Volvo and Audi smash Tesla and the new EVs from WV already sell better than Tesla in eg Denmark and Norway.  And Audi's Etron is by far the best-selling EV in Norway - a pioneer country when it comes to EV.  You’ll find Tesla in a 7th place behind VW, Hyundai, Toyota and Nissan. Demand has fallen by 76% for the Tesla Model 3 in Norway. This is not how you sell 15 million cars. This is how you lose a market.

It tells you a great deal about where the consumer mentality is headed. Not with Tesla. The new Volvo Polestar is awesome not to mention the Porsche Taycan. Tesla's brand has started to become plastic-like and actually seems a bit cheap. In a bad way.

Tesla's biggest opportunity is robot taxis.  It will not happen within the next 20 years. Then they can try and license their ai software, but there is fierce competition in that market.  Maybe there is the possibility of a data play, but it is a huge gamble.

Tesla's growth is solely due to the fact that Big auto has not been particularly interested in EV, because the facts are that there are still SIGNIFICANTLY more gas cars being sold.  It is simply a better business.  When the lines cross and EV becomes good biz.  Then I can promise you that Big auto will come at 200 miles per hour. They will steamroll Tesla. And then we have not talked at all about brand new players in the market such as a potential Apple.

Easy to grow 50% a year with the small numbers Tesla has.

Solar is a super bad business and is racing towards the bottom in terms of price.  Tech is generic and easy to make.

2021-04-21 21:55:53,wallstreetbets,"I have a question about bid/ask and orders, dunno where to ask. So I'll ask here. Or if you have a suggestion for a subreddit to ask, lemme know. There's a lot of stock subreddits but I dunno which ones would be good to ask this sort of question

So, say a bid/ask spread is ""bid: 5.51, ask 5.58"" (this question is based on the ticker [SEEL](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/goto/evaluate/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=SEEL&type=o-NavBar) in case that's of any relevance). The last price traded at is 5.58, which makes sense. Although Yahoo Finance has different numbers. But that's besides the point so just ignore that fact for now

My question is about how these numbers relate to a limit order (and just order execution in general). If I put in a limit order to buy at 5.52 (to ""overcut"" 5.51), will the bid price become 5.52?

Or is the bid/ask price only something the market maker can put in? If that were true, then would my limit order at 5.52 lead to a bid at like \~5.45 (5.45-5.52 is the same spread as 5.51-5.58)? But then of course I would get charged 5.52 because that's what I'm willing to pay, and MM collect 0.07/share. I just don't understand the specifics of how orders are sent and then executed"

2021-04-22 04:05:18,wallstreetbets,"Green and red are complementary colors. Together they contain the entire color spectrum. Mixing complements such as green and red usually results in black, brown or gray, depending on the values (darkness or lightness) of the colors and the proportions of each color in the mix. Adding a tiny amount of a color's complement to it will result in a subdued or ""grayed down"" version of the color. So mixing green and red will give you black, gray, brown or a darker, duller green or red.

2021-04-21 20:27:19,wallstreetbets,"When I was 10 years old I lived with my parents in an apartment building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. And there was a couple, very nice, quiet, a few doors down from us. And we’d see this middle aged couple every so often on the elevator

The man was always well dressed, and the woman wore stylish and expensive clothing. And when we shared the elevator, we’d acknowledged each other, saying good morning, maybe something about the weather. And then, one day when I was home alone I heard screaming and shouting in the hallway.

(redacted)

I was very frightened. But I recognized it was the voice of my neighbor and I opened the door. And she was wearing a house coat and one slipper, and her hair was in disarray. And she was terrified, imploring me to call the police. And down the hall I saw the husband standing by the open door of their apartment. And then he walked down the hall and screamed at her and took her by the arm and walked her back into their apartment.

I didn’t tell my parents what had happened, and the following morning when my father and I were leaving (my father to go to work, and I to school) the couple got on the elevator. And the husband was wearing a grey herringbone suit and his wife was wearing a fur coat and her hair was quaffed. And we all nodded to each other and said hello. And they acted as if nothing had happened"

Texas is also the 35th state in vaccination rates by % and two weeks ago or so it was hovering 45th.

You think that stopped the little engine that could? No siree bob. He just kept chugging along…chugga chugga toot toot. Not even when they climbed aboard the train, and popped out the eyes of the conducter, and blood and snot was drippin out of his eye sockets. Think that stopped the engine that could? Damn skippy…he just kept chuggin along…chugga chugga toot toot. Wasn’t until Charlie rigged the bridge with plastic explosive as the little engine was making his way across the tressel. BOOM…an explosion happened. And blood, and guts, and spit, and *** was everywhere. Bubba come crawling out the back with both legs missing. Lula May’s baby boy, and he looked up and me and he said,“ Payne I can’t feel my legs.” And I said,“ Bubba, they aint there.” And I looked down and them little bloody nubs was kicking. And I said,“ Bubba, its 30 miles to the nearest town, and unless you can flip upside down walk on your hands you aint gonna make it.” All of the sudden, Charlie was all over the place.

2021-04-22 01:41:31,wallstreetbets,"Why ITM?  I've been sticking to flipping 135 and 136 for the past handful of days, I'd rather grab those.  Volume 75k on 135 vs 6k on 131, bid ask spread is a lot nicer and tracks a lot better, and these higher volume stocks might get a little more kick from the IV.

Really tho any way you go today IV was still tanking from the post-event selling that pretty much every strike was red with AAPL being green, keep a close eye on that, when it starts trending in the other direction, when strikes start turning green when AAPL's flat, that's when you should feel like you're gonna miss the boat becauase that's IV ramping up.

I'm planning on getting some 4/30 today or tomorrow and hopefully IV ramps up to the point that it more than offsets theta and minor downwards movement, sell before earnings.  I'm thinking tomorrow might be the day.

Alternatively if you're worried about AAPL going down prior to earnings, you can go delta neutral-ish, stack strangles on Friday and sell before earnings.  Delta neutral removes underlying price from equation and at that point you'd be betting on IV causing a rise in value faster than theta bleeds (this is a very successful strat with limited profit potential, you can always dump the puts or calls when green early and continue to hold a delta pos or neg position)"

Everyone wants what they can’t have, women ignore men to drive them crazy, men ignore women to drive them crazy. You should always keep your options open, because relationships fall apart sometimes, not every love is one from a story book. You don’t need to paint with so broad a brush."

2021-04-21 21:00:13,wallstreetbets,April is the windiest month in Texas.  Just a little bit of wind can do a lot to reduce transmission in outdoor spaces  or areas with windows open or a bit of air exchange.
2021-04-21 21:02:12,wallstreetbets,"My guess is maybe weather has something to do with it? Isn't Texas in like summer heat already while most of the country is still warming up? On top of that at least where I'm from it feels like people feel like the pandemic is over already because vaccinations have started. Say grandma, grandpa and uncle Steve got the vaccine so you have a BBQ. Well Timmy and all of his cousins haven't gotten it yet. They bring it back to work/school (which seem to also be starting to lax on regulations) and the spread it around. 

The thing is though nearly the entire at risk population has been vaccinated. All the elderly and anyone with a preexisting condition were first in fucking line. Now when Tyler in accounting gets sick he goes to the dr, tests positive, and has what feels like a really shitty flu for a week or two. He's not going to the hospital and being put on a ventilator, and if he has to go the hospitals aren't nearly at the capacity they were in 2020 so there's no risk of them not having a ventilator. Everybody else just goes on about their day.


Who knows though I'm just a retard who has $40k invested in GME CSPs"
2021-04-21 21:13:52,wallstreetbets,"Definitely weather in my opinion. I live in montana and we had very few cases with no mask mandate last summer while most other states were eating ass 🤣 it was actually pretty surprising to me considering all the summer tourism. 
We just removed it again to so we will see if anything changes this summer."
2021-04-21 21:35:49,wallstreetbets,"Because the virus is caused by something, like radiation from a certain country dumping nuclear waste into the ocean right when covid hit, texas is immune because they eat nothing but hogs they shoot from helicopters, whereas most other states eat mostly food shipped from over seas and pulled out of the ocean.  Also the virus dies in sunlight and unlike California, texas spend most of their time outdoors since they arnt massively overpopulated and are busy flying around in helicopters finding said hogs"

Would meach much worse things for the Nascrack though, shit ass could fall out of it if these levels don't hold.

That said I think we hold because we are going into monster earnings and vaccine news is overall still good even if India is getting the shit beaten out of it."

2021-04-21 23:51:39,wallstreetbets,"Really the only advice you need. 
To add to my sage advice... 
Here’s how I see it. SPY has a big gap at 403. Most brains with more wrinkles would like to fill that Sooner than later. 

However they understand that the market is designed to make you look as retarded as possible, so the wrinkly brains know full well that this shit could hit 420. 

Bull case, we tested the 9 and 10 EMA, Dosent matter, and bounced. Tasty dip indeed. 

Bear case, we rallied a bit too fucking hard and it all seems a bit sus. Ber want to buy to help ease the hurt if those puts finally being green for a change. We will need a good dip, but Ber do what Ber do and they short the dips and their stop losses short cover into a rally. Logically they’re right about the gaps, and high RSI. 

The only play is the most retarded one tomorrow. Neither bull nor bear is right, we fuck off sideways to make us all look dumb as fuck and then they do the thing Friday

Edited for clarity Bc chimpu stole my phone"
2021-04-21 23:36:44,wallstreetbets,"Not if you just invest in etfs and wait long term, you cant beat trading algos especially when the market is volatile like its is now, so id have to disagree"

2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Bayer turnaround of a hammered Stonk Bayer the company that got hammered down to losing 2/3 rds of its valuation by buying the globally very beloved firm Monsanto is at an attractive buying point in my opinion. They settled most of the glyphosate cases now and are working on a solution for future cases. There will be a judge’s decision revealed on 12 th May. If the judge acknowledges the two billion additional payment on top of the 10 billion they already spent for the settlements. This stock will rally back because it trades lower than at times when analysts estimated costs up to 40 billion dollars. In reality it is much cheaper now. And here comes the next catalyst: Bayer produces the Curevac vaccines. So this will be Bayer/Curevac. Also they are in genomics and bought a lot of crispr tech companies. These companies alone could get a higher valuation alone if listed than the whole big giant Bayer is trading right now. I’m bullish and confident the company will manage a turnaround story.

Roundup was just found to really, actually, definitely, kill bees.

Oh good. This stupid headline is now spreading. 

Do you know under what conditions it kills bees in that study?

>They are about to lose one of their most sold products

No, they aren't."
2021-04-22 11:25:41,wallstreetbets,">Roundup was just found to really, actually, definitely, kill bees.

[Using a modified spray tower to simulate field spray conditions, the researchers found that 26 pesticides, including many (but not all) neonicotinoids, organophosphates, and pyrethroids killed nearly all of the bees that came into contact with the test pesticide sprays. However, seven pesticides, including glyphosate and one neonicotinoid (acetamiprid), killed practically no bees in the tests.](https://entomologytoday.org/2015/10/13/glyphosate-acetamiprid-low-toxicity-honey-bees-2/)

[We do know that habitat loss, disease, invasive species, climate, and many other factors have detrimental effects on not only bees, but most wild animals, whereas glyphosate is an important method in the toolkit to counteract many environmentally harmful effects of farming. As weed ecology professor Andrew Kniss writes, if farmers would be forced to forgo glyphosate, on top of consequences like increased soil erosion and fuel use, we could well see a return to less diverse rotations.](https://thoughtscapism.com/2018/06/11/no-glyphosate-is-not-a-threat-to-bees/)"
2021-04-22 03:58:17,wallstreetbets,Roundup lifts revenue by about only 8% it doesn’t way in that much. There is a lot more to Bayer than Roundup. Their biggest cashcows are Xarelto ( a blood thinner) and eylea an eye treatment. Blood thinners are used a lot right now because of Covid blood clot risks. But it balanced a bit because operations got postponed because of Covid in 2020 so there wasn’t that big of a jump in Xarelto sales.

VIAC generates 40% of it's revenue from advertising, 31% is subscription (or affiliate) fees, and 23% is from licensing content.

VIAC is transforming their business into a streaming giant, with PlutoTV (43 million monthly active users) and Paramount+ (launched in March this year, 30 million CBS AllAccess subscribers were moved to Paramount+). VIAC acquired PlutoTV 2 years ago for 340 million (now worth billions already).

next earnings is on May 6 (first time Paramount+ user growth will be reported).

&#x200B;

[VIAC price back to pre-COVID levels](https://preview.redd.it/rtoepeqkiku61.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d0979e1292a4d9341a959348311196cea32d1c)

VIAC is back to pre-COVID price levels after it announced a $3bn equity raise for content production end of March and after millions of shares got dumped on the open market after Archegos  blew up.

[A: NFLX, B: VIAC](https://preview.redd.it/jjv6xuzvlku61.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=251a483a42aa4460ca81b0622c6591d5e3d6aa54)

VIAC annual revenue was $25.29bn (NFLX was $25bn), while VIAC net income was $2.31bn (NFLX was $2.67bn).

VIAC trades at 24.9bn market cap while NFLX trades at 244.6bn (that's correct, 10x more). NFLX posted pretty disappointing earnings yesterday, also mentioning slower user growth for 2021.

Plus they have tons of outdoor billboards that people aren't leaving their homes so outdoor billboards are taking a hit. Suddenly VIAC is the second most valued where as they used to be the number 1. Now, Google and FB are the leaders in their space, and Viacom which was old TV, was the dominant player. I never even watch TV anymore."

2021-04-21 21:31:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah these companies need to find a good balance. Personally I really like going to a theater. It’s an experience and streaming can’t really replace it. I think a lot of folks feel this way.

2021-04-22 00:20:54,wallstreetbets,"lol nah man i don't even know if they have boiler rooms out here in LA. probably. 

just someone who has worked in the industry and is actually just kinda bringing you the lwidely held belief about the company. i mean i know this aint' the place for it but if this is a place people want to learn about their investments you should at least look at who runs the company and how they've managed to squander an excellent position with bone-headed decision after the other. vanity fair would be a good place to learn about the redstones or deadline hollywood. I like his graphs too, but they are backing up a pre-decided thesis bc when you don't cherry pick data it'n not as pretty. 

Just look how streaming services they've tried before paramount+. Worst part is they ruined comedy central and mtv in the process

you also might want to drop the crazy hedge fund conspiracy bullshit teaming up against wsb against every bear case. Might provide you a more balanced perspective. Great part is you can still totally decide what to do."

2021-04-22 14:24:32,wallstreetbets,What is it that makes you so confident it is worth more than its current prices?
2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry covered calls warning...be careful Be careful with writing covered calls for blackberry. They(institutions and shorts) want you to write these covered call. Total short on stock is about 60 million or 10% of all shares. They realized that blackberry has a monopoly in connected and EV car operating system with Blackberry QNX and IVY, and they also have monopoly in Cybersecurity with Blackberry Spark for protecting critical iot devices (government computers and phones, drones, trafficlight, meter, all smart city infrastructure). This is a very critical monopoly that Blackberry will not admit to yet because Congress will then break them up. 

&#x200B;

Why monopoly in cybersecurity for IOT?  
If you look at all hacking that happened since December on government and enterprise(30,000 companies), none using Blackberry Spark were impacted!!! After Department of Commerce was hacked they immediately switched to Blackberry Spark. Same with Airforce and Canadian Government.  Crowdstrike will be a joke in coming years. Only blackberry has a zero trust architecture out of all cybersecurity company, and that's why they are able to protect governments from hacks like Solarwind and others can't do it. 

&#x200B;

Why monopoly in Car EV and Connected Cars?  
The Blackberry QNX software is THE ONLY car operating system authorized for connected cars. This is why every car company is signed up with Blackberry. Even Tesla's component coming from NVDIA uses Blackberry. The NVDIA controller used by Tesla for their autonomous driving is running on QNX. QNX is inherntly the most secure operating system in the world!!! The proof is in contracts from every car company to blackberry. The Rev will be about $50 per car in coming years. The Blackberry IVY will add about $10-$20 recurring revenue per car per year in coming years. 

&#x200B;

So why not write covered calls?  
The institution and hedge funds and shorts will trigger them soon. The Patent sale will be minimum of $15 billion for 25,000 patents. Patent is bread and butter of any company. Chen said ""most patents' that's why i'm thinking he's selling more than 20k patents. $15Billion automatically takes the price to $40!!!!!! overnight!!! you will lose your shares to hedge funds that're short and institutions."

2021-04-21 22:14:49,wallstreetbets,Lmao if BB had a monopoly on connected cars and IOT security they'd be making more than $700 million revenue. Secondly Crowdstrike also stopped the solar winds hack. Third... you expect them to jump the monetization of BB per car from $4 to $50 in a couple years? Forth the patents are nearing end of life. Nobody is paying $15 billion for patents that are going to be done in 6 years. Lastly. I personally don't see congress breaking up a $700 million company growing at 6% a year because they have 68% of the EV market and lower %s of the other markets.  Look at  Luxottica and the eyeglass market. All you have to do is have competition and you're fine.

""Cars are like bombs"" is a timeless analogy, thanks. 

Wisekey sell a hardware backed protocol and BlackBerry sell a system, the hype around connectivity is the same and both are specialists in secure end points. Chances are they're mutually beneficial.

My point was BlackBerry don't have a monopoly on secure Comms in cars, I'm a fan of BlackBerry don't get me wrong I was calling this ages ago. My only draw back is I don't see Amazon ever allowing it's partners to profit, there's always some horribly structured skeleton in the cupboard that benefits Amazon, plug power are a prime example."
2021-04-21 20:55:56,wallstreetbets,So why was every other company hacked with solar wind and blackberry’s client are the only ones not impacted? Why did entire dod and department of commerce switch to blackberry after the solarwind hack? If this is your bread and butter u should know better. Why entire us military using blackberry spark !!!
2021-04-21 20:56:41,wallstreetbets,Only blackberry has zero trust on single platform with ai based software. And persona that’s only available on spark! Do u even know what persona is?

You just sound like a fool and a cry baby with these responses. Not sure how you mean for them to sound, but I picture them being said with a very whiney voice."
2021-04-22 13:55:34,wallstreetbets,What did sco make? Blackberry is leader in embedded systems for iot and ev cars and connected cars and also best cyber security per NSA. So sell the patents and use the cash to market best of the best products.

2021-04-21 22:27:58,wallstreetbets,"Dude. Do u know what blackberry spark is? It’s a unified endpoint security. John Chen and blackbrrry has been telling everyone that blackberry spark clients were not affected by solarwind hack!!!

Also, go look up blackberry Jarvis! It’s a tool that would have saved solarwind supplychain. The tool recently got endorsement from NSA and dod for best in class. The tool is for supply chain for spotting exactly the type of attack on solarwind."
2021-04-21 22:30:18,wallstreetbets,"U don’t seem to understand UES or blackberry Jarvis. Leave it to cyber security experts. Blackberry is a single platform zero trust solution...no other company has it. Crowdstrike had to partner with 3 companies to provide half baked zero trust that’s not even as secure as blackberry spark, and on top it’s expensive and inherently less secure than blackberry spark. Lol."
2021-04-21 23:39:11,wallstreetbets,Lol persona is beyond multi factor. You don’t need password anymore unless the ai detects it’s not you based on ur behavior like phone swipes or holding orientation etc. it basically can detect and stop insider threat like Edward Snowden. Dod tried to create this in house but failed badly. Blackberry has created this persona tech that’s now being deployed dod wide and everyone is using it. It’s a personal digital ai that make sure it’s you!! And not someone else.

2021-04-22 17:03:46,wallstreetbets,"SCO made the same thing - software. Including embedded systems. Very successful company in the unix space until Linux and Red Hat and others offered a better value.

THEN they tried to cash in on their patents and IP, like BB is doing now. Didn't work. In fact they became a laughing stock.

2021-04-21 21:02:54,wallstreetbets,Is it listed what the patents actually are? Who uses them? Is this something Apple needs?
2021-04-22 10:43:39,wallstreetbets,There is a reason their phones are no longer viable.
2021-04-22 09:53:08,wallstreetbets,"They've already lost a bunch of patent infringement cases.  Because these parents aren't enforceable because many of them are bogus.  How many of these parents are actually any good?

Whatever FB settled that case for, it already showed up in BBs earnings.  So, clearly it wasn't very much.  Probably because BB had a weak case and couldn't prove any actual damages."
2021-04-22 14:17:44,wallstreetbets,Dude u don’t understand blackberry products. Jarvis could have prevented solarwind hack!!! What part of that don’t u understand!! It’s a software supply chain tool that can spot hacked code!!
2021-04-22 10:46:12,wallstreetbets,"He has no idea what they are or what they are worth. His ""years"" of patent experience is probably the 3 months he has been bag holding BB thinking anything that is shorted will be squeezed.

If there was any massive value in these patents the company would mention them and analysts would have written about them."
2021-04-22 14:00:11,wallstreetbets,The company has been mentioning them for ages. They even break out rev from it but analysts refuse to value the patents. Go look at every analyst covering blackberry and not a single one has valued the patents.
2021-04-22 14:04:33,wallstreetbets,"So, is every single analyst wrong or do you wildly overestimate them?"
2021-04-22 14:07:30,wallstreetbets,I think these analyst don’t know how to value blackbrrry. They continue to value it as hardware company. They also don’t know the trchnology that blackberry has and why it’s a monopoly. It’s the best of the best. Even entire US military is using blackberry cyber security. Some department switched to blackberry immediately after solarwind hack. This is Tesla of connected car software .
2021-04-22 14:12:22,wallstreetbets,"No, it isn't. 

Why did you buy originally? You thought it was going to short squeeze, right? Don't turn that wrong assumption into an investment. Blackberry is right where it should be at. 

If you think every analyst is wrong yet you found the secret you should probably humble yourself and take a real look at the company without thinking about the bags you are holding. Ego has blown up now multi billion dollar hedge funds than a bad economy ever could.

Blackberry has a small niche in software with security. At one point, i believe, they were the only one approved at the government level. That isn't true any more. They are not special.

Also, learn what ""monopoly"" means before you use it for anything that is a market leader."
2021-04-22 14:16:02,wallstreetbets,You think blackberry will sell 20k patents for less than 10bil? I will write a article soon on why patents are more than that
2021-04-22 14:17:54,wallstreetbets,"If they have something worth $10b then the company would be worth $10b. It is not. It is worth $5b.

Name one patent that is worth anything close to that.

I am looking forward to your article on these patents."
2021-04-22 14:19:03,wallstreetbets,Omg that’s what I’m trying to say! This company patents are miscalculated. I will write article later today
2021-04-22 14:19:19,wallstreetbets,Patents are minimum $15 bil
2021-04-22 14:21:28,wallstreetbets,"You can say as much as you want but you are still wrong.

I will wait for the article to see what everyone is missing."
2021-04-22 14:20:53,wallstreetbets,If they were worth $15b then the company would take themselves private at the current market cap of $5b.
2021-04-22 14:34:52,wallstreetbets,Private equity would have bought them a long time ago.
2021-04-22 16:45:27,wallstreetbets,They didn’t have 5bil cash to buy up all the shares. Even if they did and tried buying the shares it would spike and they could never buy the shares for that much
2021-04-22 16:47:52,wallstreetbets,"The analysts are idiots. They are working to manipulate the stock for a buyer or are doing it for competetion, so Chen know what to do to shut them up."
2021-04-22 14:41:33,wallstreetbets,I know.
2021-04-22 16:46:36,wallstreetbets,Privat me equity can’t just take it private because they have cash!!! One of the guy in Canada tried to buy it for 7 bil 7 years ago and board had rejected it. This company is now pure software so ceo knows what it’s worth.
2021-04-22 16:50:38,wallstreetbets,"If you told any number of people ""hey, if you take bb private you can make $10 billion with just selling the patents"" they would be lining up. Every whale would be begging to get in on that."
2021-04-22 16:51:38,wallstreetbets,"Enough. Everyone on this site claims ""manipulation"" when they are wrong."
2021-04-22 16:44:51,wallstreetbets,Chen is not selling!!! He knows this company is worth 100bil. Plus how is company supposed to take themselves private when they don’t have the cash on hand?
2021-04-22 17:27:29,wallstreetbets,Okay.  Whatever.  I seriously don't even think you know which way is up.
2021-04-22 16:58:55,wallstreetbets,"Who is going to tell this to private equity? Ceo is a public company ceo, he can’t go behind shareholder back and make a deal with private equity!!!"
2021-04-22 17:00:49,wallstreetbets,Prem watsa offered 7 billion dollar to Chen when company was making hardware and failing. Chen and board rejected. Now they are the most secure software company in the world and in iot sector. All the design win from ev and car is future rev. What’s the value of it? Someone miscalculated big
2021-04-22 16:48:51,wallstreetbets,Chen would take it private. Are you telling me that he would rather work as CEO than make TEN BILLION DOLLARS?
2021-04-22 16:53:36,wallstreetbets,This is so bad I need to comment twice. If he truly believes he can turn a $5b company into $100b there is no chance he stays public. You move heaven and earth to become a majority shareholder and take it private.
2021-04-22 17:08:33,wallstreetbets,The hell he can't! Read up on Dell. Michael Dell took them private last time.
2021-04-22 16:56:33,wallstreetbets,How do u take a company private if you don’t have cash? Please explain
2021-04-22 16:57:11,wallstreetbets,He is about to show wallstreet and analysts how they have miscalculated blackberry.
2021-04-22 17:03:25,wallstreetbets,But someone tried to take it private and board rejected it. How can u take it private without approval from board? And at what price?
2021-04-22 17:09:33,wallstreetbets,You find backers and prove your numbers. Not hard if they have a legit $15b hidden in plain sight that they can sell tomorrow.
2021-04-22 17:09:59,wallstreetbets,You think it is worth 100b. Anything less than that.

2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PLUG has been beaten down too much these past few months, its time for a recharge. Im $PLUGged in. Holding til 30k+ 🔌 "
2021-04-21 20:38:17,wallstreetbets,"From Plug, Investor Relations:

Thank you for your email, and your being a shareholder in Plug Power. We are cautiously optimistic this will be concluded prior to our Q1 earnings release, so in that perspective we are hopeful weeks and not months away. In the interim the company continues to execute on all the endeavors we highlighted back in Jan 26th on the Business update call.

I can tell you at the highest levels we at Plug Power are very sensitive and aware of the stress and pressure this has had on our companies stock.

PLUG power also is not immune to the pullback and pressure in speculative/growth and the cleantech sector i.e. ARKK FSLR SPWR BE BLDP FCEL TSLA etc.

Of course nothing is final until its completed.

I do want to reiterate what the current situation, of our delayed 10-K, will not effect:

These changes will not affect:
Revenue
Cash position
Business operations
Our commercial arrangements
Our guidance that we laid out in the Jan 26th update.

KPMG has been our independent accountants for close to 25 years, and while they have determined our prior Financial Statements need to be restated, they are related to several non-cash items, relating to lease accounting as rule 842 came into effect in 2019 such as:
• book value of right of use assets and write down of financial obligations
• Loss accruals for certain service contracts
• impairment of certain long-lived assets
• classification of certain costs, resulting in a decrease in R&D search and expense and a corresponding increase in cost of revenue.

Our core material handling clients do business with Plug Power through either Direct Purchase, or with Sale-Leaseback agreements which hence involve operating leases.

Our accounting as a result can be complex and technical due to the nature of our business. These changes aren’t being made due to override of controls or misconduct, and KPMG had informed the Audit Committee that these issues are not related to an override of controls or misconduct.

Plug Power, at the highest levels, is focused on the tremendous opportunities and business propositions at hand. At the highest levels, Plug Power is also sensitive to the situation and the dynamics as a result and is working with KPMG around the clock to rectify and complete this process in order to release our 10-K as quickly as possible.

I hope this is helpful, we thank you for your support, and wish you and your family stay safe – Roberto

TL/DR: Restating before earnings (probably). If it's as harmless as they say it is, it'll bounce. Good luck on your calls"

When you Google ""state of Michigan Microvision,"" the first result on CNNMoney shows they currently still own 1M shares, which is a 0.64% stake. The filing system in MI also shows the date purchase as 12/30/20 with a filing date of 2/1/21.

I follow dot connectors like this very closely-- I imagine it would be all over the MVIS sub if they sold, which I certainly would've seen. Also, in case it was simply confusion, the state of Michigan DID dump their shares back in June 2020, but bought back at a higher PPS recently, so perhaps that's the thinking. They're still holding, though.

This is a 2-dose vaccine and I received my 2nd shot two months ago, which I understand is the minimum time needed for the trial. 

The study was recently changed to a ""crossover"" study, in which the people who received placebo in the first 2 shots will now be given the real shot, and vice versa.  I received my 3rd shot today. This effectively eliminates the placebo group, I have not been ""unblinded"" but all placebo group participants are getting shots, and the effectiveness of placebo/vaccine going forward can not be determined directly. This means that they must already have the data needed to obtain FDA emergency authorization. 

The time from Phase III start to authorization is now the same amount of months as  Moderna, Pfizer, and J&J took (about 4 months). 

Based on this, I believe the Novavax vaccine will obtain FDA emergency approval within the next 2-3 weeks. The stock can be expected to rise a moderate amount when this news occurs.

Since he now ""controls"" the contracts, can he sell them to somebody now for $18.65x4000=$74,600?

If he ""exercises"" his option does that mean he has to come up with $2,860,000 ($715x4000) and then he can sell them all for $740/share (closing price today)?

Sorry, another retard trying to learn...L0L"
2021-04-22 09:47:14,wallstreetbets,"The price of the contracts are traded during market hours like any asset - the buyers and sellers determine the price just like bid/ask spreads on stocks etc. The greeks capture the inherent value of options contracts through from real time market information i.e. time left til expiration, bid ask spreads, volume, etc. Long story short, as an underlying moves (i.e. Tesla here gains) the options become more valuable because there is time left on the contracts (albeit short) and the stock is moving further into the money. Essentially, call options gain value when a stock goes up, put options gain value when a stock goes down.

Most options contracts are not exercised, they are bought and sold just like stocks are bought and sold. This will tie into exercising in a moment.

Since he bought the contracts (paid premium), he can sell them whenever he wants up until expiration. If he has the capital to buy 4000 shares at $715 (40 contracts x 100 shares per contract at $715 which is the strike price), yes he can exercise his options and take control of 4000 shares of Tesla. He still has to *buy* them though at $715 per share (costing roughly $2,860,000) just like you said. If he sells the contracts though instead of exercising, he can still collect the profit without needing to put up nearly 3 million dollars.

You had the math part down, hope this helps."

2021-04-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I am shorting GoPro (GPRO) Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of GoPro and have been since the release of the GoPro Hero 2. 

But although I like the product and the GoPro Hero 9 is my current go-to action camera, the stock price far overvalues the company. The stock saw around a 520% increase to the peak of recent prices from last March. What justified this increase in price? 

GoPro’s recent turn to selling subscriptions and their high 2020 subscriber counts was the good news for investors. They had a total of 760,000 subscribers by the end of 2020,  a 145% increase in subscriptions from the previous year.  Those who follow this company closely know that this increase in subscription price was due to the release of the GoPro Hero 9 and the promotion of $200 off a bundle package with the purchase of a GoPro subscription. Users know that the grammar of the subscription details was very sketchy and it was unclear if users could immediately cancel their subscription after purchase without being charged the $200 they saved because they didn’t hold their subscription for a whole year. Their subscription numbers hold just based on their GoPro Hero 9 release, few GoPro users turn to GoPro for accessories. Most GoPro users will go online where they can purchase an accessory mount from a different brand for more than 70% cheaper. GoPro’s strength in versatility has always relied on third party gear for custom mounts and specialized attachments. GoPro users who are looking to mod out their GoPro with a mic, ND filters, or stands, turn to companies such as Rode, Polar Pro, or other companies that are cheaper and higher quality than the modifications GoPro provides.

The company also turned to its Quik app to attract anyone who does video and photo editing/storing, not just GoPro users. GoPro has always been releasing apps but the apps themselves were finicky and never worth using from my experience. It will definitely be interesting to see the report on the success of the app when the company reports its earnings on May 6th.

As a GoPro user, as much as I like the company, I see that the product line is stagnant. GoPro releases one new camera a year (plus the MAX) and it’s users can barely justify the upgrade due to minimal change between models. Many youtubers and influencers commonly tell consumers to wait for the next model to upgrade since differences aren’t very significant. GoPro’s latest release was a pair of floating black sunglasses. They have tried multiple times in the past to get into lifestyle gear and it never caught on with their consumer base but they continue to release lifestyle gear, an indicator of how little the company is focusing on change. The moat of GoPro used to be HUGE but now, every other company has an action camera that is cheaper, similar in design, and often does more than what the GoPro offers (DJI, InstaOne, Garmin). 

The company is stuck on its GoPro Hero line and for the most part it is trapped. It tried to expand into making drones but DJI snuffed them out quick. It relies too much on third parties to provide accessories for the users that their accessories don’t make them enough revenue. Their software apps have always been substandard. GoPro is not a long term hold and I would argue they are not a short term one either. Earnings report on May 6th!"

Subscription revenue model replacement of traditional one-time licenses is getting annoying for most users (basically draining you without doublequestioning if you really need it or use it)   
Keeping that in mind I would strongly agree with this DD. Never liked GoPro even knowing that they revolutionized the VLOGing industry.

2021-04-22 04:57:06,wallstreetbets,"sidewalk chalk really fucks with people. 

the past two years someone has been drawing strange green lines on the sidewalk outside of my apartment

a few months ago I went out for a cigarette early in the morning and I noticed a bum was taking a piss on the lines

He looked at me all googly eyed laughing through his underbite and said,

"" funny how how dilution works, huh ""

Then he started rooting through his layered clothes, reached in a pocket and chucked a green piece of chalk at me. He took off with his cart full of garbage (treasures) laughing and ranting about some crazy financial shit. That's when I put two and two together and I made 5."

2021-04-22 13:03:44,wallstreetbets,"To be fair to Motley Fool, I think their podcasts (MarketFoolery, Industry Focus, and Motely Fool Money) are pretty good and insightful; I admittedly consume more MF podcasts than any other in the financial space. However, the vast majority on articles written on the free version are hot garbage written by grifters (as useful as Seeking Alpha articles--which are about as helpful as sandpaper in an outhouse . . .). The only articles on MF I put any stock into are those written by reoccurring staff/analyst on the podcast (primarily from Lou Whiteman)."
2021-04-21 23:05:37,wallstreetbets,I hate how vague every comment is.

2021-04-21 20:02:24,wallstreetbets,Just your friendly reminder that Motley Fool isn't just a shitty news company. It's a hedge fund that also operates a shitty news company. Keep that in mind next time you go long one of the stocks mentioned in their articles.
2021-04-21 21:20:03,wallstreetbets,Motley Fool the piece of shit hedge fund? Just making sure were talking about the same Motley Fool the piece of shit hedge fund.  Because fuck them. Were taking the market back for the people. Ruining it for the hedge funds? Yes. Fuck them.

2021-04-22 06:20:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah when I first got into private investing I got scared out of good stock for being so trusting in them. Eventually I figured out there was nothing motley about those fools.

I just ignore those articles. they are everything that the critics here are claiming."
2021-04-22 03:48:42,wallstreetbets,"It's a dig at specifically the Motley Fool who regularly have writers who post FUD and bearish sentiment analysis on companies without a mention of what they make or what strides the technology held is taking. 

Not to mention a few times published articles have just had mistruths or just flat out bad DD. 

These publications also want you to think retail investors are complete morons."

Some of their picks have been stars, NFLX, NVDA, OLED, and will make up the bulk of my gains but that’s how it should be."

2021-04-22 10:48:33,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah they really target new investors and try and stir up fomo on the garbage they want to dump and fear into the stocks they want for lower.  There is alot of scum bag articles out there.  I remember the one that posted all false info and pictures of APHA and said the stock was going to 0.  Well it worked and crashed the stock and no consequences for false and misleading information.  It took a while to recover but the OG investors still saw the value.  Wish I had more money to throw at it at the time but I had already put my life savings into it.   Luckily I held and sold at the recent high (but sold half my position throughout the several years of recovery to pay the bills)

2021-04-21 21:09:42,wallstreetbets,"Articles are written by boomers who failed at life, went back to college with their millennial children, got a finance degree but failed their GAAP and CPA exams, and actually kind of understand what it feels like to be a millennial or younger in terms of job prospects but still bought a house for $20,000 in 1985 working as an auto mechanic that is worth half a million and a condo in Florida for $100,000 in 2002 that is also now worth half a million. Their retirement plan is 50% based on receiving social security and medicare because their 401K balance is under a million. They will leave their children the original $20,000 in equity and a reverse mortgage balance that exceeds the value of the properties."
2021-04-21 20:37:34,wallstreetbets,"Why does the podcast always mention the same six stocks?

* Chipotle

I don't know. But it's terrible for brand management. I hate having to explain the paid service is full of Fools and the free stuff is written by fools.

2021-04-21 20:38:04,wallstreetbets,"With RB, the last time I recall David mention TSLA was when he was reviewing a 5-stock pick from the free podcast. since he was reviewing a 5-stock pick, I'm going to guess that it was a pick from January or March of 2018. It may have been recommended since then, but I've only ever heard David talking about Tesla in terms of how it has performed since he last recommended it, never as a rec.

On RB it has not been an official rec since 2011, and I don't see where it was ever a Best Buy Now either. :)"

2021-04-21 20:34:31,wallstreetbets,"Higher price means higher risk of the stock price is a reflection of future growth rather current progress. Netflix just took a hit when their earnings report showed they didn’t hit their subscriber target. That means future growth was priced into Netflix’s share price and when they didn’t hit the target, the growth value was removed. 

A lot of people think Tesla’s future growth is already priced in, which is why so many think it’s overvalued. If you believe that, then you would believe a higher price represents a higher risk."

2021-04-22 13:35:18,wallstreetbets,"Entitled? Yeah. Ucky. 

I can see both lines of thinking. One, your parents dont owe you shit. Be glad you're alive. Two, your parents enjoyed economic prosperity built on raping the environment and taking advantage of foreign workers in budding international trade. That stopped working so now we take advantage of domestic workers too. 

I expect nothing from my parents, but I have a goal of leaving behind a security trust for my lineage.  When they start sterilizing people it aint gonna be the rich ones."
2021-04-22 17:42:04,wallstreetbets,"Naw. But you need about $1MM under management to draw at the same rate as the max SS benefit (starting at age 66) using the 4% rule. If you had $1MM under management and the max SS benefit you'd be living off around $70-80K/yr.   


Meanwhile, child of boomer here, I am trying to figure out how to get a >$4MM portfolio to have that same equivalent purchasing power when I retire (assuming 2% inflation YoY average). Basically having to save 2X my mortgage payment to achieve that with conservative return estimations. If I do ever receive SS, great, I will finally get that Porsche I want when my reaction time is like 10 seconds."

2021-04-22 17:54:18,wallstreetbets,"check out the ""Rulebreaker Investing"" podcast as a sample. some of the philosophy there is the same. One of the things David Gardner says he looks for when picking companies is that the ""experts"" claim the stock is overvalued. He explains why in the podcast. And it has to do with reasons like, a good company is going to cost money, something. He's not looking for overvalued like GME, just to be clear.

in a nutshell, from the latest 5 stock pick on the podcast from april 8 Rule Breaker Stocks are:

1. top dog and first-mover in an important emerging industry (ABNB)
2. having a sustainable competitive advantage (AXON)
3. strong past price appreciation.  (Winner's keep winning. a company that's doing well tends to continue doing well unless acted upon by some outside force, the same with a company that's doing poorly). (AVAV)
4. good management and smart backing (ATVI)
5. a strong brand (AAPL)
6. considered overvalued by many people who are observing them.  This David says, is the secret sauce. And while a stock might not have all of the above, this one only really applies to stocks that have the above criteria met. GME is overvalued, but David's not recommending it. Apple on the other hand... Everyone wants to say Apple is overvalued.

One of the reasons that he gives for why this works, if the first 5 criteria are met, is because you're getting the stock while everyone else is afraid to buy in, sitting on the side lines. but apple is going to keep winning. and as it does, a lot of these people are going to decide that they need to go ahead and buy in.

Just want to be clear, this last one may sound counter to what you want, but not every stock he recommends might be considered overvalued. but then again the writers on these finance sites (including the free stuff at [fool.com](https://fool.com)) say everything is overvalued and don't know what they're talking about right? He has rerecommended stocks here and there that are continuing to win. but he's only applying this to companies that are the top dog and first-mover in an important emerging industry. so there's risk there and more reward. and indeed, some of the strongest winners in Rule Breaker are re-recommendations. he'll recommend companies before they appear on Stock Advisor. trying to find the netflix, amazon, etc. very early. Stock Advisor tends to wait for companies to prove themselves a bit more.

when I was researching rule breaker and stock advisor, there was a critic many years back who wrote about how dumb he was because he had recommended Netflix again at such an overvalued price right before its price dropped to half that and would never recover. This was back in 2007. (I think Rulebreakers were originally recommended it in 2004 he said). David had the last laugh on that one.

edit: I know everyone criticizes Fools because all they ever talk about is Netflix and Amazon, but I think that's because of brand recognition. those aren't even David's biggest winners. I don't even see them recommended in Rule Breakers. Probably just stock advisor. The reason I say Netflix or Amazon is because everyone has heard of Netflix and Amazon. Companies like Mercadolibre, intuitive surgical, shopify, netease... I only ever heard of these companies since I registered for rule breakers, and it's hard to remember the names of these companies that I'm not invested in. That's not to say that people at wallstreet bets haven't heard of them, but when trying to pull some examples out of thin air, it's easier to remember examples like Netflix or Amazon."

2021-04-21 20:40:21,wallstreetbets,"Nah it was fly by night junk. If you went to google finance and looked at the ticker for the delisted company, you'd see a ""News"" item from one of these bots talking about the quarterly performance of the company. Except they hadn't posted quarterly results in a year. Since Google Finance was still just listing the last traded value of the stock, the bots would calculate a 0% rise in the price and do other pointless calculations. 

If the bots would just seen that the last trade date was more than a month before the current date, they could have saved their energy for something else."
2021-04-22 01:25:44,wallstreetbets,The more the merrier
2021-04-21 20:56:19,wallstreetbets,"Rulebreaker.Motley Fool has many paid services, but the only two that are really worth noting (unless you have lots of money to invest I guess) are Stock Advisor (SA) and Rule Breaker (RB)

Stock Advisor is picks by both David and Tom Gardner and their teams. you get more picks, but Tom tends to be a bit more conservative in his strategy. David's picks have historically performed better (on average, because his picks can also perform very badly, but when taken together, his picks beat the market by a much higher percentage). so for people who are not risk-adverse, you can sign up to Rulebreakers which is just David.

So where Netflix might have recommended in 2007 by Stock Advisor (I think), Rulebreaker might have recommended it in 2004 (it didn't, but I can't remember a specific example). Point is Rulebreaker is riskier and more about trying to find the companies that are going to be the next Netflix or Apple, Stock Advisor seems to be more conservative and waits a bit longer for these companies to prove themselves.  But you miss out on some growth (and some risk) in the process.

There are many articles that would give you better explanations of the differences. If you're interested, maybe give ""Rule Breaker Investing"" podcast a listen. There are many episodes where David Gardner explains his philosophy behind picking companies including the latest (free) 5-stock pick. and today's episode is a review of previous 5 stock picks.

David Gardner believes in keeping score, and not all of his picks do well. the ones that do well, have so far done spectacularly enough to overcome the ones that do spectacularly bad. :)

[https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/](https://www.fool.com/podcasts/rule-breaker-investing/)check it out. It's free, it's by David Gardner, so it's not the same as the normal free garbage at fool.com"

2021-04-22 02:57:57,wallstreetbets,"Negative return is certainly a thing. But negative growth is also, many companies have reducing profits, and many even have reducing revenues.

The buzzwords for risk in standard portfolio management do indeed refer to different concepts. 

Using the legendary risk manager Howard marks' definition of risk: ""risk is the potential of bad outcomes"". Under this definition, bad outcomes become more likely as price increases, and certainly becomes more likely if the price increases relative to fundamentals. But yes, I suppose risk in a portfolio can also be managed by weighting low or negatively correlated investments relative to the riskier ones."

2021-04-21 21:01:45,wallstreetbets,"It depends on how much money I have available to invest really. I started late, so I'm behind, so I'm really going after it. I try to do at least 1500-2000 a month because my goal is to catch up. so at first I was going to try and do 1000 per rec. but then I signed up and discovered the 5 Best Buy Now's per month. and there are guys in the community who have charted the returns on the Best Buy Now's if you bought and sold after 3 years. and since they perform so well, now I try to split my money 3 ways. In practice, I do maybe 300 per Rec, and 200 per BBN.

&#x200B;

I discovered there was a coupon to get 2 years for 99 instead of 1. I canceled and resubscribed just to get the discount. they didn't seem to have a problem with that since I was still within the 30 days atleast. It did take them a while to respond to me, but the did respect that I sent the email before the 30 days expired."

2021-04-22 08:46:40,wallstreetbets,"Do you remember what apple was at 20 years ago?! I’ll give you a hint. The iPhone hadn’t come out yet, people claimed they’d go under because they also thought it was a turd company, and the price was around 40¢ per share. 



Would you rather have purchased apple stock once it became a behemoth and it was safe? Or would you rather have purchased it at 40¢ per share when it was a company that had some really good ideas, that would go on to be THE driving disruptive force in its market, but people continually bashed because it was something that Cramer bashed? 

Take revenue and profit numbers out of your argument and tell me why you don’t like it? Because we know that apple, Amazon, and Tesla rewarded the people who invested in the vision and not the balance sheet. If you say it’s the tech, I know you have done your research of where things are going. If you say it’s the company history, I’d say that’s how they used to be before bringing in key players from major tech and auto companies to help navigate this ship on its course to destiny. 

The GME saga, blew the lid off the fact that hedge funds and other power players arbitrarily manipulated the price in their favor. And pulled the media puppet strings with hit pieces whenever they wanted. So, if you’re going by headlines or hit pieces, I could understand why you say it’s a turd. But I truly don’t understand why you could say that if you take a deep dive in to the tech, how it stacks up against the competition, and how it’s going to be a major disruptive force."

2021-04-22 07:13:51,wallstreetbets,"Been following MVIS for a while. Woke up to the news that Cramer said it's pure shit. Checked the price. 10,50$. Usually it bounces between 12 and 16. So  invested a bit and am up now 20%.

Thanks Cramer"
2021-04-22 09:49:59,wallstreetbets,"The difference is Apple was a real company with a previous track record of legitimate products and millions in real revenues. Apple was also always a consumer computer company. 

MVIS on the other hand, despite being in business since 1993, has not produced a single viable product and STILL has financials like: -83% return on assets, -267% return on invested capital, -541% return on equity. It also STILL only has 26 employees. 

What about this company after 25+ years in business makes you think it will be the next Apple? 

Because lIDaR? Cathie Wood has an Ark to sell you."

2021-04-21 23:06:24,wallstreetbets,"It *was* utter garbage. 

I bought in at around $0.95... sold enough to get my stake back around $7.50, and now I'm sitting on almost 1k free shares. This thing could go down to a penny and I'm still up. But I think there's a better chance of it going to $70 or higher."

People are allowed to disagree, it’s not a bad thing. After all there’s got to be both buyers and sellers. 

Hope you have a great day!"

2021-04-22 07:18:09,wallstreetbets,"No, you're missing the point. By your logic he should have sold at 800% already. Or at 400%. Probably even at 200%. You see where this is going?"

2021-04-21 21:11:33,wallstreetbets,"Beer, and alcohol in general, is easy to make. There are local distilleries everywhere. Does it mean they will be the next big thing? No. Same with weed. To grow it and create a national brand still takes serious investing which most people don’t have the means to do. And if they did, they’re a quick buyout away from joining a bigger company. I believe high tide and APHA will be major forces in the US market."

2021-04-21 21:58:04,wallstreetbets,"If its legalized nationally you'll see it enter the stock exchange in new York, sure some larger farms and distributors will go public, but much like other commodities you'll see weed futures and farmers reliant on government subsidies. 

Gone are the days of blocks of government cheese.

These are the days of bricks of government dank."
2021-04-21 22:11:06,wallstreetbets,Biden has been clear on his stance with this. As long as he’s President I don’t see it ever happening.
2021-04-21 22:19:05,wallstreetbets,Here’s how clueless I am...   I wanted a coffee in Amsterdam...  so me and the kids head into a coffee shop...
2021-04-21 22:59:06,wallstreetbets,"I hadn’t notice them bleed 34% over the last 3 months, why do you ask?"
2021-04-21 23:03:22,wallstreetbets,"Just so I understand it, my local illegal weed man has CHEAPER untaxed weed that is stronger and better and he delivers versus the OVERTAXED corporate weed at the dispensary that you need some card to get. I don't know _any_ weed smoker that is going to buy corporate weed until it's cheaper. 

2) I have been to amsterdam. You go into a coffee shop, they have a weed menu, you buy and smoke it. There isn't like a line down the street or anything like it. There is so much competition the pie is already split in to 100 parts. It's something you can literally plant and grow yourself. There isn't a dominant NAME to weed because everyone already got it from their local weed man. Purple Urkel or whatever else it's called. It becomes a novelty. You smoke it, get high, realize you overpaid compared to the Jamaican weed you got from the cornerboy up the street, and go back to the cornerboy."
2021-04-21 23:23:52,wallstreetbets,I almost thought this was r/investing and not WSB because I people were actually talking about the stock and not saying meme things haha.
2021-04-22 00:16:25,wallstreetbets,How would they needlessly put people in prisons tho
2021-04-22 00:29:50,wallstreetbets,... I mean taxes
2021-04-22 00:52:26,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully, I have a SNDL call that expires in 2023."
2021-04-22 07:11:00,wallstreetbets,The mistake in everyone’s analysis of this sector is that it’s crowded. There’s too much capacity. Legalization won’t fix that.
2021-04-22 09:47:39,wallstreetbets,"Mid term elections are around the corner, which means Dems could very lose control of either the House or Senate (or both). Dems have until Nov 2022 to legalize marijuana on a federal level. If weed doesn’t get legalized by 2022 mid terms then marijuana won’t be legalized this decade."
2021-04-22 10:01:17,wallstreetbets,"Buying Leaps and losing my a$$ for the past 3 months, but averaged down recently and seem to have found the bottom. Lets get high."
2021-04-22 10:37:32,wallstreetbets,"The overwhelming problem with Pot stocks is the companies are unprofitable.  In the end a Pot stock is really no different than any other agriculture play and the reason to own a company in my mind is because the company is making money or growing fast and taking share from their competitors. It looks like to me that Canopy CGC is on the cusp of making money and with its line up of beverages coming out may become profitable company in a few quarters so maybe it would make a good investment. I have been looking at Grow Generation that is the company that sells the fertilizer and supplies to grow Pot (I am a customer, bought some stuff yesterday) there might be more to make in supplies than the end product. I am an OG from California and been growing for over a decade the supplies are really expensive. I have spent over $1,500 on nutes to grow a dozen plants before so the easy money might be in the Supplies business as pot is cheap these days"
2021-04-22 11:11:53,wallstreetbets,So get some LEAPs eh?
2021-04-22 11:46:35,wallstreetbets,So when should I start shorting private prison stocks????
2021-04-22 13:41:00,wallstreetbets,It will bleed until the issue is brought up again or a company is specifically mentioned.
2021-04-22 16:17:53,wallstreetbets,Why do my posts get deleted when I post about literally this
2021-04-22 16:38:27,wallstreetbets,The problem with ALL weed stocks is illegal weed is better quality and cheaper....
2021-04-22 19:45:54,wallstreetbets,Imagine thinking weed will go out of style... where have you been the last 30 years
2021-04-21 23:08:42,wallstreetbets,"Did you know that ALL legal Medical Marijuana users must turn in ALL their firearms and ammo?  Your state knows who the users are. Technically all users must turn them in. It is a Federal Law.  I am not a gun enthusiasts but this is serious BS.  Write your senator now to get Marijuana removed as a Schedule 1 drug.  All that is needed is a couple democratic senators to be heros and not approve any bill until Biden signs an executive order changing it.  They work for ""We the People"".  On the day that it changes, then and only then is it worth investing in."
2021-04-22 04:58:01,wallstreetbets,Decriminalization is still a pretty big deal. It would allow the states to do whatever they want in regards to laws on it. I'd imagine a lot of states are probably going to want to legalize it because of those sweet sweet taxes.
2021-04-22 16:24:07,wallstreetbets,Don’t let any idiots talk you into SNDL. Their management is terrible
2021-04-21 20:37:17,wallstreetbets,"BioHarvest sciences dude

2021-04-21 20:23:27,wallstreetbets,"Because everything has been bleeding for like 12 weeks.  Shits been awful since like Jan 27th, today was a breath of fresh air"
2021-04-21 22:50:06,wallstreetbets,"Federal legalization means that anyone can now enter the business. The dispensaries that exist now artificially cornered the market with the help of the government.

TLDR: When weed is legal, dispensaries are going to have a shitload of competition."

2021-04-22 11:59:17,wallstreetbets,You should have started in November.
2021-04-22 05:56:45,wallstreetbets,And the bears can't seem to understand that growth potential is also a thing
2021-04-21 20:19:12,wallstreetbets,Grwg..they deal with all the growing equipment and have way less competitors than the dealers.  Its a coin toss between tlry apha Huge acb etc
2021-04-22 18:53:05,wallstreetbets,"I've actually made $300 off them lol, prob wouldn't happen again"
2021-04-21 20:10:05,wallstreetbets,"Wtf. That’s how you don’t kill off the black market. The 10% here is bearable here in Michigan, and a lot of people already think it’s too much.

41%? No fucking way. Nobody will pay $8.20 in taxes for a $20 g... they’re probably losing out on a fuck ton of tax revenue for the many people that will continue buying black market..."
2021-04-21 22:59:05,wallstreetbets,"This will be a big problem if legislation at the national level isn't a horse of a different color. The legal industry in California is DWARFED by the black market here and it's not even close. Combination of absurdly high taxes giving incentive to sell under the table and high barriers of entry make it really difficult for the people that are good at growing/producing cannabis to get into the industry legitimately, and for that I'm a little bearish on legal weed (god it hurts me to say that)"
2021-04-21 20:21:39,wallstreetbets,"You get what you want from a reputable place.  Initially legal sales are tough but over time they come down, CA Co wash are very competitive prices"
2021-04-21 22:21:22,wallstreetbets,"🆒

Glad you're able to predict the market with 100% accuracy.

But this is WSB, not r/investing, so I don't know any of the words you just said."

2021-04-22 10:19:14,wallstreetbets,I don’t get why people think weed is this insanely profitable. Shit is cheap af. It’s a plant. Would you be this hyped if corn was becoming legal? It’s never gonna produce as much money as alcohol does. May as well go sell oregano i’m pretty sure oregano cost more
2021-04-21 22:07:58,wallstreetbets,Always take them profits.
2021-04-21 22:19:23,wallstreetbets,"You can drop 25 states right off because of population and who cares market share. MO just says, “do it like x state or we ignore you.” When they decide to catch up MO will just slide in.

For the other 25, there’s what, like 5 lowest acceptable common denominator scenarios and they’re sitting on so much cash and legal and logistical and lobbying expertise they’ll have no trouble navigating and dominating the market."
2021-04-21 20:12:08,wallstreetbets,"I dunno, upwards of 50% it might get weird...

I pay 10% here in Michigan, and even I feel like it’s a lot, but I’ll pay it, it’s not so bad. 25-50% is just some bullshit though."
2021-04-21 21:02:29,wallstreetbets,"Meh. The level of knowledge among cannabis investors is extremely extremely low. If someone can't see the point because of the way it was delivered, then I don't give a damn because they were wrong in the first place anyway."
2021-04-21 22:37:53,wallstreetbets,"wouldnt it be just as good to do both cpg and retail?

it seems kinda limiting to not have the additional ability to expand into perhaps smoking lounges in the future or smoking bars or smoking entertainment etc"
2021-04-21 20:27:36,wallstreetbets,"That's not true and also makes no sense, why would they cut into profits that much.  Shit is grown in Humboldt/oregon/Washington and shipped or driven to NYC.  Maybe in East bumblefuck Nebraska but not in a decent sized metro"
2021-04-21 20:54:33,wallstreetbets,"Based on how much it will be taxed, it’s not ideal, I believe healthcare and real estate are far better investments"
2021-04-21 20:17:08,wallstreetbets,Also consider the regulations. Many states have limits to how many plants you can grow for sale. Also sales across state lines is also a big issue.
2021-04-22 06:12:47,wallstreetbets,"I think the big tobacco companies and Constellation brands will be the long term winners on legalization. In the short term, I'm most interested in the companies they have heavy investment in."

They provide software to producers, wholesalers and retailers for regulatory compliance. Not much on them since they just merged with HLIX but just put out guidance they are raising capital for acquisitions."
2021-04-22 01:05:02,wallstreetbets,"Any company can do what another can do but what if they don’t have the real estate to sell? We can’t really have a marketplace online just yet due to difficulty shipping products like this in the US, but I’ve considered REITs that focus on dispensaries as a decent approach to this for now."
2021-04-21 23:19:47,wallstreetbets,But what advantage so they have over existing companies already positioned in those states?
2021-04-21 22:42:00,wallstreetbets,"A tiered regulatory system is expected to happen. So there would be lines between production, distribution, and sales."
2021-04-22 10:58:22,wallstreetbets,"You may have gotten quality products that were independently tested, but they most certainly were NOT tested or approved by the FDA. To date, the FDA only has like 2 or 3 marijuana derived products they've approved (none of which are vape carts or edibles) and you have to have a prescription from a licensed health care provider to get them."

We picked up and rolled some fatass blunts and chilled with the guy. I lowkey hate the shops and will support dealers as long as I can for the super fresh cheap packs and good times.
2021-04-21 20:21:01,wallstreetbets,"They're consolidating because the Canadian barely has anyone to sell to. It's a whole different ballgame in the US, we have almost 10x the population. The real weed market is in the US. I expect Canadian pot stocks to drop like a rock once US is legal."
2021-04-21 20:56:03,wallstreetbets,"In Ontario it's 4 at one time. A decent plant can produce 300-500g's. That's anywhere from 1200-2000g's, or 3-5lbs. Most chronics would be hard pressed to smoke that never mind the other 12 plants they can grow in a year."

2021-04-21 22:53:57,wallstreetbets,By “new” you mean its still at a early point in the process of cannabis eventually being sold as universally nationwide as alcohol is? Yes. I agree. Still early. Industry still has most of everything ahead of them. Biiiiiig MSOs guy as well as that cgc from ways back
2021-04-21 23:27:08,wallstreetbets,"wdym? like producers wont be allowed to be distributors and distributors cant be retailers/sellers?

if its not a bother, do you have a source for this expectation?"
2021-04-22 12:13:21,wallstreetbets,That
2021-04-21 20:39:11,wallstreetbets,Tell that to tobacco
2021-04-22 07:20:32,wallstreetbets,What are your favorite weed stocks? I really like trulieve and iipr as my top two i think. I have some apha cuz i daw they were toing to be the biggest after the merge with tilray but looking into the business they still havent managed to turn a profit which makes me not want to invest much more into it.
2021-04-21 22:11:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes but at the same time those Canadian companies will be exporting to the US so that means their export market will also grow 10x so I predict their earnings will grow. Hard to say what happens to the stocks as things get priced in, etc."
2021-04-22 12:11:45,wallstreetbets,"In the sales of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms, there is a line between manufacturers/producers and distributors/retailers. This is more about lobbying and multiple groups having their hands in the pot than it is about consumer safety. These rules vary from state to state, so there are certainly exceptions that will be made as well as more strict/unfair regulations out there. 

I would assume that cannabis sales will likely fall under similar umbrellas in most states. Look to how your state handles alcohol sales."
2021-04-22 09:13:03,wallstreetbets,"the growing conditions for tobacco are more restrictive.  also it grows in big leaves.  also, it has to be air dried and requires lots of open space or a drying room.  so again, not the same.  thanks  though."
2021-04-22 08:08:05,wallstreetbets,"Just the 4 I mentioned above, nuvm though is going to be my dump if it goes positive stock, only down 5%, but has been very underwhelming...  the other 3 though, due to when I got in, are all currently 35-57% gains. I consider none of these “hold and buy for life” stocks, just wait for opportune moment stocks.... I personally think what some of the other commenters say is true, once legalization happens, it’s going to boil down to a few big corporations, and that’s when you buy it as a retirement stock."
2021-04-21 22:26:37,wallstreetbets,And some of the Canadian companies already have hemp grows functioning in the US
2021-04-22 06:16:16,wallstreetbets,"Mexico has legalized and will likely become a major exporter (like they have always been) when it's legal to do so.

2021-04-22 05:17:41,wallstreetbets,"Pain has a subjective scale and cannabinoids are already used in mass for pain relief, where its legal. Lots of chronic pain doctors don't even want to start with opioids because fear of addiction. It doesn't need to *replace* them 100% to be a financially successful investment. Getting 50% people not even close to opioids would be a tremendous scientific achievement."

100% not practical from a high school living at home perspective, but we def bongified that shit.

In conclusion, we were CRSR first and they owe us mailbox money."
2021-04-22 12:17:46,wallstreetbets,"no no, this makes sense, I agree that these regulations will extend to marijuana, thanks for clarifying

If I understand where you're coming from, CPG would improve the margins, because it limits the liabilities associated with these regulations, is that correct?

I still have a hard time understanding why retail wouldn't dominate in the long run (as in the loooooooong long run, when international marijuana conglomerates become common place). Wouldn't you always get better margins cutting out the middle man retailer?"
2021-04-22 09:15:23,wallstreetbets,"You're clearly talking out of your ass. Weed requires essentially all of the same steps. Controlled environment, has to be dried (like every plant that's smoked), idk why leaves vs buds is a huge factor for your either.

If you don't like weed just say it. Don't try and make tobacco sound complex."
2021-04-22 09:08:54,wallstreetbets,That’s a very good point. I don’t think they will put the Canadian companies out of business in the US but they own a lot of that market.
2021-04-21 22:26:25,wallstreetbets,"Trulieve dominates Florida.  The third most populated state in the US and we don't even have recreational here.  They will explode here if we can ever get it on the fucking ballot.  I swear we're gonna be the last state in the US to get it.  There are Curaleaf stores here so you can't really say there isn't competition.  Their stores just crush here.

2021-04-22 12:23:26,wallstreetbets,"The original comment wasn’t me. I jumped in to share my predictions for how regulations will go when it’s federally legal. 

I don’t agree that CPG will be the only way to go. Corner liquor stores are plenty successful. But those aren’t usually publicly traded. I predict that retailer chains could be hugely successful, if they follow a McDonald’s model of offering franchise opportunities to would-be small business owners. 

And some Consumer Packaged Goods (CPGs) will certainly be successful. That will depend on who can scale quickly and who can manage their brand successfully. I predict Phillip Morris will acquire as many of those successful brands as possible."
2021-04-22 09:35:28,wallstreetbets,I'm clearly not since people can and do grow weed in their homes.  never said it doesn't have to be dried.  I said drying large tobacco leaves requires lots of space.  that's why they build large drying barns.  I never said I don't like weed.  my comments have only ever been directed towards the logistics and economics.  so another false interpretation.  sounds like you're the one who doesn't understand what they're talking about.
2021-04-21 22:37:55,wallstreetbets,"""there's one other major company so you can't say there's competition."" 

Hahahahaha. There's 5 individual retail stores within a 10 minute drive of me. 

Breaking news for you: Trulieve ONLY dominates because there's no competition at all. Like non existent compared to almost any other marijuana market in the US. Your points reiterate my point about knowledge of cannabis investors.

Even pointing out the 3rd most populated state, yet has one of the lowest per capita ratios for dispensaries. You don't think that's weird and destined to change?"
2021-04-21 23:42:12,wallstreetbets,"Of course it will change.  But Trulieve does have a strong foothold (lead) on any new comers.  Are you comparing it to other states that already have recreational with your per capita stats?  Or just medical states? Last I checked Florida had about 420K card carrying medical folks. You don't think part of the reason they have one of the lowest per capita ratios of dispensaries is because they are the most populous state in the entire US without recreational? There are 20+ million people here.  

Florida is also the second most visited state in the country behind California (something like 35 million people a year) so recreational here would most likely multiply sales several times over and you think that would devastate Trulieve?  Competition will come and time will tell.  My guess is Trulieve will get sucked up by a bigger player.  I'll take my chances.  Thanks for the reply.  Party on dude."
2021-04-21 22:15:20,wallstreetbets,"That’s funny.  You mention Cali, Seattle, Colorado, Amsterdam...  Then, out of nowhere, Detroit.  At least we’re ranked high somewhere, for something.  Megatron may be on to something!"
2021-04-21 22:36:57,wallstreetbets,Michigan has been legal for few years now and has fairly good shit. Really you can find top quality bud almost anywhere that there are smokers willing to pay for it. Not sure where dude got the idea that if you haven’t lived you whole life in cali that you haven’t ever seen good weed before.
2021-04-21 21:12:22,wallstreetbets,why do you talk about their reasoning? you make no sense. its objectively a better company if it doesn't profit of the addictions of people anymore. periode

Here, since this is so difficult for you.

In this hypothetical example, you are a bad person who kicks puppies. You then publicly stop kicking puppies, and start kicking the local raccoons. You are still a bad person.

I hope that was helpful."
2021-04-21 21:44:36,wallstreetbets,your analogy is implying that selling tobacco has the same moral implications than selling weed what is absolutely retarded (or maybe you say kicking puppies is less bad than kicking raccoons what is also retarded btw)
2021-04-21 21:55:51,wallstreetbets,"No, but you seem like you really need this on a personal level which is really strange.

2021-04-22 10:44:51,wallstreetbets,"Nintendo has been around since 1889 and owns 2 of the biggest video game franchises, Mario and Pokemon, the latter also being the highest-grossing media Franchise despite only being around for 25 years. They saved the video game industry from collapsing after the 1983 crash. Crossed-shaped d-pad, shoulder buttons and battery backup were invented by Nintendo. They revolutionised portable gaming systems, motion controls and so much more. They always try to innovate, sometimes it goes wrong like with the Virtual Boy or WII U but other times like with the NES, GameBoy, DS, WII or Switch, they strike gold. They have survived some harsh years. They are the next Disney. As long as they continue to focus on developing fun experiences and pushing the boundaries for video games, I will continue to hold this stock."
2021-04-21 23:22:23,wallstreetbets,"Potentially, but I have been following NTDOY for years.  Not to long ago they couldn't break $20, and were stuck below that for years.  Mobile game PokemonGo got peoples attention and the thing exploded.  All of the properties, history and everything else Nintendo had going for it, and mobile games (Later the MarioRun game helped give it another lift).  This stock has never acted right, so while it would be easy to say how can Nintendo have a lesser value than Roblox, (which I believe is EXTREMELY overvalued).  I wouldn't bet on Nintendo mooning anytime in the near future."
2021-04-22 02:33:11,wallstreetbets,"I agree with this and also believe Japanese companies in general are a great buy right now. Japan's economy has been held back by low inflation for decades – in a very inflationary environment, like we now seem to be entering, we should be seeing major zaibatsus like Nintendo absolutely explode in value.

As always, not financial advice. I own no shares of Nintendo at time of writing. Ask your doctor if this post may be right for you."

2021-04-22 14:29:39,wallstreetbets,"That's not random, it's only the nouns."
2021-04-22 13:10:31,wallstreetbets,"Here's my hot take... The topic/question being answered isn't, ""who's more popular Mario or Mickey?"" It's, who's more well known. Hands down it's Mickey/Minnie Mouse. The type of content that surrounds the mouse, is more of less harmless and at times educational for kids. Which, is easy for parents to expose their kids to at a younger 2-5 age, or younger if reading books.

The younger a child is exposed to something, the more familiar they are to that child. Hence, more well known."
2021-04-22 13:26:52,wallstreetbets,"I was actually genuinely interested with the pikachu comment from your experience, because I feel kids these days do get way more exposure to things like Pokemon early on with plushes, toys, cartoons etc. Than Disney. But, that is likely based on the generation the parents grew up too. Also, id point out that your comment is very western centred, kids arent necessarily getting as much exposure to Disney and Mickey in particular across places like Asia."
2021-04-22 16:17:21,wallstreetbets,"I would agree, my views are from the western front. And, also a personal opinion.

Kids exposure to content as such being discussed is going to be different from culture to culture and house to house.

I grew up with the OG 151. I wouldn't mind if my kids wanted to watch it/learn about it. They haven't really wanted to... But, I still think that Pikachu is more of an older kid (5-9) entry age, and can't really compete on the level of ""well known"" as the mouse.

This may rub some people the wrong way. But, comparing the ""known"" level of Mario or Pikachu to Mickey Mouse, is similar to comparing Yao Ming to Michael Jordan, or Ichiro Suzuki to Babe Ruth. Both Yao and Ichiro are going to be OVERWHELMINGLY well known and loved by their respected countries. But, they aren't as well known as M.J. or The Great Bambino."

2021-04-22 07:35:44,wallstreetbets,"Hah, yeah, accurate dosing is important, especially for therapeutic doses. That one twitter thread shows it has a lot of promise for some people

I got into it specifically because LSD is limited to less than once a month and it's a 10 hour trip that keeps you awake, so not useful on a weeknight. It's been so nice recently being able to get off work and get blasted out of my mind, and be mostly good to go the next morning at work, unless I dose to close to bedtime and there's carry over and I need to avoid people til lunch. I like having a casual intoxicant.

On Monday, I took MDMA to celebrate Bicycle Day, and it was a wonderful roll, then as I was coming down I took a few hits of D8 and it shot me back into a full on trip. It was wonderful, a nice way to recharge after weeks of uninterrupted work"
2021-04-22 10:49:51,wallstreetbets,"You got the buying options essay from u/HellStaff, here is the selling options essay.  

[reddit.com/r/thetagang](https://reddit.com/r/thetagang) is a good intro to the lower risk methods of options trading.

Selling puts and/or covered calls (CCs) is one of the lower levels of options trading.  It's a very simple strategy unlike some other options strategies.  That doesn't mean it is the right strategy to use all the time.  I sell CCs because that is all Fidelity will allow me to do.

Buying a call is BULLISH.  You are buying the right to purchase a stock at the strike price at or before the expiration date.  You don't have to take the stock if your bought call blows up either you can always sell it for more than you bought it for.

Buying a put is BEARISH.  You are buying the right to sell a stock at the strike price at or before the expiration date.

**Major Key of Selling Options** \- premium is paid immediately which can be reinvested.

The last 30 days of the option lose the most value to time.  ThetaGang explains the math behind it if you give a shit - I sure don't.  If you sell covered calls picking a date 30-45 days away is usually the way to go because of the time decay.

Let's say I have 100 shares of AMC.  Looking at the 6/4/21 date that is 43 days away... a $10 strike is going for \~$1.75 per share (at least when I wrote this).  That means that if I sold the option someone would pay me around $175 for the right to buy my shares for $10 regardless of stock price on 6/4/21.  Reminder - they don't have to exercise the call (buy the stock from you).  This ultimately caps my upside while reducing my risk if the stock price drops.Max revenue is ($10stike+$1.75premium)\*100shares = $1150.If the stock hits $20 I still sell it for $10 share and keep the $175.If the stock hits $5 nobody in their right mind will exercise the option and buy my shares for $10.  I now have $500 in stock plus the $175 in premium.

If the stock price goes down that means the option will be worth less which means you can buy it back for less and wait for a green day to sell another call.  I've been selling SNDL calls for a couple of months and while I've lost nearly $700 on the stock I've also realized gains of $650 in covered calls.  Not the ideal scenario but a good example of how this helps reduce your risk.  Had I owned shares alone I'd be out more money.  Jokes on me though I used that $650 to buy more poor performers.  Although I also sold CCs on those so I hedged, but then I bought more poor performers.  It is a vicious cycle for sure!

As time goes on and the price fluctuates that options value will go up or down.  You can always buy the same option to close your position later.  I do this a lot when the option is worth about 33% of what I sold it for.

I've been doing this for about 2 months now.  So far most of my stocks are in the -10% to -25% range but my account is up about 40% since I started.  Failing upwards never felt so good."

2021-04-21 21:20:33,wallstreetbets,It happened to me with GME. Bought at $20 literally a day before the first run-up. Decided to sell some CCs just for that week and BOOM! Thankfully bc it expired EOW I was able to buy back in for the bigger squeeze the following week but lost out on a ton of gains.
2021-04-21 22:08:46,wallstreetbets,"Oh man I feel you on this. I bought GME in January and sold it on the run up. Then I bought back in when it was around $43 in mid February. My guess was that it was going to trade between $40 and $50 for a few months before gradually going back up, so I sold $50 strike CCs. Then literally the next day after I sold the calls, it started rocketing back up."

2021-04-22 11:38:32,wallstreetbets,"I think $20 is pretty risky. That target entirely depends on a squeeze. 

I am playing this in a manner that I expect I'll ultimately make money whether the squeeze plays out or not, but will make a LOT of money if the squeeze plays out. So I have $7 and $7.5 calls spread between May, June, and August, along with a Jan 22 LEAP at $6 (along with a few hundred shares of the stock itself)."
2021-04-22 12:35:55,wallstreetbets,What does that have to do with anything ?

Still, that leaves $43 billion of equity which is almost double their market cap. It's an insanely bearish valuation no matter what angle you approach it from, and that's exactly my point. Even doubling the expected loss of these two events then subtracting that all directly from equity still doesn't bring their Price/Book to a flat 1.0 (it comes out to about 0.93 if you're curious). What CS did was completely stupid, don't get me wrong, but this is a ludicrously bearish case to be pricing in."

Protein replacement therapy is also a huge opportunity for mRNA technology; preferably with further modifications to be less immunogenic.

Shit squeezed."
2021-04-21 21:35:32,wallstreetbets,I think part of it has to do with the Pattison attempt to take it private a few years ago at $16 per share..
2021-04-22 00:00:45,wallstreetbets,"My favorite expensive Oreo-wannabe cookies in the natural foods section used to sell a box of 16oz for what seemed to be an always on-sale price around $4. I don't imagine they sold much because of the price being higher than regular Oreo cookies, and no one giving much of a shit about where their junk food comes from. Probably pushed the quality date a lot.

Anyway, I kept buying them regularly. One day, I can't find them. There is some other box on the shelf, made by the same company, with the same kind of cookie inside. Net weight: 12oz. Same price, same sale.

A fucking TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT drop in one product shift. At the same retail price! Not 15.5oz, not 15oz, fuck, not even 14oz. 12oz. I was fucking FURIOUS. Did they really think I was just some stupid fucker that was going to pay 33% more per cookie now, out of fucking nowhere? At first, I doubted myself and did not know what the old box weighed. But I found it. And when I had that information in my head, I started taking the whole idea of shrinkflation very seriously. And very cynically.

I think I've bought two or three boxes in the years since, with one box purchased for me because they were my favorite, but I don't even look anymore. If it was a waste of money before, it's just a donation to the brand now. It's all off-brand junk food at the discount grocery store for me now.

I knew this kind of thing happened, but no one expects something as severe and as blatant as a 25% package downsize at identical retail prices. Even if it is for dumb overpriced crap already.

If you purchase anything on a regular basis, you owe it to yourself to track the price and the quantity measure of the items you're buying—on top of shopping around if you have the time to invest in doing so."

Basically, I picked this year, because GME created a hype overload where these meme stocks are all over social media. Even my trading apps notify me of the trending tickers on WSB now."
2021-04-21 20:58:24,wallstreetbets,Lol it's easy to say you won't dilute when you just signed debentures 6 months ago for 55 million shares. If those debentures are converted BB will have over 600 million shares. That is why I said they aren't shareholder friendly. Signing debentures for cash they don't need at the height of a pandemic right before releasing your largest product in years (Ivy) and selling a large part of your patent portfolio. Their last Fairfax debenture cash also went unused. They are paying Watsa for the privilege of giving him $6 calls essentially. I'm also comparing the shares with GME and AMC before they diluted this round. Not to the general market.
2021-04-22 01:50:25,wallstreetbets,"You sound convinced, you should buy some options! They are selling for next to nothing for Dec 2021.

I mean they’re so cheap for a reason of course...the only reason it popped in Jan was coz of the meme stock short squeeze hype (as did most other meme stocks).

It’s been a 5$ stock since late 2019, averaging about 7-8$ for 5y outside of the hype spike."

This may all still fall apart, if they don’t execute or get unlucky, but if this works the reward will be huge."

2021-04-22 02:24:21,wallstreetbets,"Ya, I just was saying it seems to average about 7-8$.

Another strike to 14/15 would be good for options tho, they’re cheap as right now."
2021-04-22 02:32:01,wallstreetbets,Well im a freaking idiot because i had the position on jan 27th and the only thing i did was close some incredibly profitable weekly options and sank it right back into the stock. Was not expecting robinhood and its masters to disable the buy button. Sigh. Was up 3 mill for a minute there.
2021-04-22 02:29:23,wallstreetbets,"Yeah a buyout is possible, but things are going to have to start going right well before that and I predict it will be for 30 or $40 billion but only if qnx-ivy is a commercial success. If it does have success the stock hits $30 sp, then $45 to $50 per share buyout. I think that could happen within 3 years if stars align."
2021-04-22 02:39:26,wallstreetbets,Damn that stings!

2021-04-22 06:29:16,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. No it’s not 118% (or whatever ridiculous number gme was lol) but 30% is high. We will never see a GME move again. Ever. But there are plenty of stocks that can be moved a couple hundred % easy.
2021-04-22 19:03:35,wallstreetbets,"Google would be my guess but I don't think it really matters who it is as long as they are a big enough player with deep pockets. 

Regarding A-Sample testing, it just means that automotive OEMs, like Ford for example, will start getting their hands on MVIS' A-Sample to validate the specs and decide if this hardware is legit enough to purchase for extended testing."

IMHO there are new shorts who have entered the game which don't get reported anymore. And retail owns a large percentage of the float. We will see what happens."

It's one of those ideas that sounds great on the surface and then you spend a little time thinking thru the core concept and realize it is full of holes."
2021-04-22 16:46:02,wallstreetbets,"And why couldn't they simply use the data to get lower loss ratios, and pass discounts onto the consumers ; aka what they're saying they're doing?

This thesis isn't proven so far sure, but also, it doesn't seem like a huge stretch to me"
2021-04-22 16:54:25,wallstreetbets,Every other giant insurance company already offers this. Hence root brings nothing to the table unless they are amazing at a marketing/acquisition.
2021-04-22 16:58:09,wallstreetbets,Or unless they are amazing at telematics and they can actually pull it off.
2021-04-22 19:20:20,wallstreetbets,"That's what I said, unless they have revolutionary proprietary algorithm. The data is just data. They aren't going to be able to get any more than the next company. The phones have GPS and gyro/inertia. Capturing the data is trivial for anyone. 

It's taking that data and making sense of it by separating signal from noise and turning into an accurate prediction model is where the magic happens. This is actually pretty trivial for a large company to do also once you have a large data set AND have access to the underlying claims data. I would argue All State is much better positioned to leverage this model than Root for example. 

The point is unless they create some insanely complex algorithm that has accuracy magnitudes better that other companies can get close to, then they have nothing going for them. As someone in the field of data modeling I can say the chances of Root being in a position like that are slim to none in this application just because data is the key and the big insurers already have access to way more data than Root does or ever will until they become their own underwriter and sell insurance at a deep discount (loss) to try to gobble up share, which would be prohibitively expensive. 

Maybe Roots model is going to believe their secret sauce is better than everyone else's, and they subsidize the premium by paying a part of it with a contract with underwriters that they get refunded a chunk of premium when loss due to accidents is below the expected amount. They would essentially be placing a bet that they can create better risk profiles, and now they are in the gambling business. Workable model for a while as long as the inputs remain constant (which they won't) but even then it won't scale well."

i want to post a DD post but i can't yet because the age of my 1st post on my account is less than 30 days 😩😩😩. calling for mod help rn

but i'm pretty sure it's gonna moon. it looks too good on paper, they have a proven business model that generates them cash which they're funneling into a retail brand.

they've spent 0 on ad spend so far, first time spending is in 2021.

This topic is easier to create there, cya Guys on the top! :)"
2021-04-22 10:57:58,wallstreetbets,"Well, I wish you all the best.. however IMHO for now (according to [this](https://gragieldowa.pl/spolka_arkusz_zl/spolka/CDR)) there are still way too many ""low price"" sellers. I'm not sayint that it is impossible.. But there are a lot of people willing to sell for (way) less than 500 and that's the main problem for what you're doing.

Right now (data is delayed of \~ 15 mins so it's not perfect) there are \~151900 shares being sold for less than 250pln and \~80200 for less than 200pln.  Total number of shares being sold rn (up to 10000pln ) is something like 1mln shares..

\+ It's really hard to find data on the short float absolute value..  

&#x200B;

IMHO, real hypothesis:

let's say that for being screwd Hedge Funds should be shorting something like 1/1.5mln shares.. If not more...  **AND,** maybe more important actual CDPR investors should behave **massively** (95+%) like true ~~retar~~  apes, so.. not being happy with a +5-6-7-10 or even a 20 30 40 50% but holding no matter what.. 

Now WSB has this level of coordination and we have seen it with gamestop.. But would you say the same for the average CDPR investor? (I'm not from Poland, so maybe you tell me :) )

Btw.. Don't get me wrong, it's definetely not impossible and the fact that 66+% of people are selling for 400+pln is impressive, but yeah.. It's still quite hard."
2021-04-22 07:32:56,wallstreetbets,"Now  482 329 stocks for 500 złoty is like  54,75 % of all sales volume."
2021-04-21 20:02:00,wallstreetbets,May I ask your thoughts on purchasing VXX ? Especially for so long? Are you expecting some sort of market crash soon?
2021-04-21 22:41:40,wallstreetbets,"I played it when it spiked, and the chaos of GME made me hold it. It’s a mistake, but it held even for like 2-3 months. It only fell off in like the last few weeks. I’m holding through this reverse split, because retail might do something stupid like sell off shares to buy VXX. 

Honestly, I still think something in the market is jacked. The fact that GME is still sky high (in my opinion) indicates the issue is unresolved. I could just be overestimating retail, since there is evidence that retail is responsible for the run up on Tesla. 

We’re also going through an economic experiment with very high stakes as debt exceeds GDP. No one knows the future, but if people like Ray Dalio and Micheal Burry are concerned, I’d listen."

2021-04-21 23:27:58,wallstreetbets,"I got 55 shares at 8.41 a couple days ago (college student). I really see some great potential with this stock. Not only has the price reached a sustainable bottom, but the potential of a short squeeze makes it even better. The company itself is well positioned to succeed in the Medicare market and has serious growth potential. They are disrupting a huge industry and this stock looks ready to take off.

Bullish 🚀"

2021-04-22 06:36:55,wallstreetbets,"Plus, who cares how many tickets they sell.  Stock price isn't about revenue it's about future potential.  Their future potential is ""we might temporarily make a bit more money in this dying space""..... yea that's definitely worth $1k/share...."
2021-04-22 06:43:58,wallstreetbets,And none of this matters at all.  Stock price hasn't been tied to sales since.... what the 40's or something?  Certainly not now.  People who think the stock price is going to go up because the theatres will get some revenue again have no business investing anyone's money.
2021-04-22 06:39:50,wallstreetbets,"It's doesn't matter if they die, that's not the question.  The question is why would this stock be worth more than $5-$10/share?  Because.... Dolby surround?"

2021-04-22 03:58:28,wallstreetbets,"That's a very immature way of looking at it, given that you live in a time where many engineering skills intersect with the arts. To name a few:

Autodesk, engineering architecture and construction
Ableton, audio engineering
React, web and mobile development


The list goes on. Segregating the studies is a huge disservice to STEM and any scientist or engineer worth their salt values creativity and critical thinking when it comes to producing solutions."

2021-04-22 18:47:42,wallstreetbets,It’s an inflated debt ridden stock $HOG. NOT sure why ....it’s going up because Jim Cramer said so
2021-04-21 21:39:00,wallstreetbets,are you still gonna hold these for earnings?
2021-04-22 07:06:26,wallstreetbets,Update they beat the estimated of 1.07. “SLM (NASDAQ:SLM) reported quarterly earnings of $1.77 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.07 by 65.42 percent. This is a 124.05 percent increase over earnings of $0.79 per share from the same period last year.” the earners was released after hours so you still got time today to get in before it goes up. Current price target by analysts is 22.25. Current ah price is 20.25. If there is a huge buying pressure with this low volume then it very well may got up more. Current have 74 $24 and 53 $25c
2021-04-22 18:48:47,wallstreetbets,I short on $HOG BUT it keeps going freaking up

2021-04-21 22:27:54,wallstreetbets,"Your reply doesn't even make sense to what I said. 

You don't exercise shares, retard. The ""YOLO"" thing on old wsb was buying crazy options with a lot of money. He did that, and no longer holds options. Therefore the YOLO is over. 

Also, with congress already on his ass, if he were to post when he sold, it would cause a very quick domino reaction of people selling. This would get him flagged for market manipulation, which he doesn't want. 

I never said anything about him selling shortly after buying."

2021-04-22 09:44:03,wallstreetbets,"So THOT medical assistant came over again the night before last and she is supposed to come over again tonight.  She says she wants to do a workout every other night.  Still no action, and this has presented a new problem: now the other female medical assistants want to come over and work out too.  Why is this a problem you ask?  Medical assistants are, in general, 200+ pounds, unvaccinated, and constantly covered in flaming hot cheeto dust.  My equipment can't handle the weight capacity and there's not enough ventilation to handle their fast food farts.  If i refuse, it becomes obvious that I'm only letting THOT girl come over because she's hot.

Meanwhile, THOT girl takes a sexy snapchat LULU pants selfie in my bathroom.  So everybody else on her snap feed has gotten exactly as much as I have to this point in time."
2021-04-22 17:51:18,wallstreetbets,"So here is journey with my work THOT up to this point in time:

1) Hot girl gets hired at my work.  She has a ring on her finger, i don't give her much thought

2) about 6 weeks ago that ring disappears from her finger (apparently she was engaged and then she wasn't)

3) she starts coming over to my office to chat a lot.  Trying to find out more and more about me.  Tries to add me on social media, but i don't have any and I'm certainly not giving her my reddit username.  

4) i sign up for snap and we chat before, during, and after work.  She adds me to her second account which features SFW workout pics.  She dreams of being an influencer

5) she finds out that i have a home gym and asks to come over.  I was hoping for sexy times, got the cold shoulder on sunday.  She comes over for a second time on tuesday and we chat this time while working out.  She tries to get me into her instagram feed, but i decline, so she takes a short workout video and some pics, and then one sexy pic in my bathroom for her 2nd snap account

6) she offered to buy me coffee this morning and is sending me lulu pics today.  She is coming over at 8ish pm PDT tonight"

2021-04-22 19:57:11,wallstreetbets,Fucking busy. Also busy because I spent soooo much time shitposting with you all that I got really behind in work. Lol
2021-04-22 12:48:09,wallstreetbets,This is better advice lol
2021-04-22 10:18:39,wallstreetbets,Making a move is like buying a way OTM call
2021-04-22 10:21:05,wallstreetbets,SIMP ALERT ⚠️
2021-04-21 20:03:01,wallstreetbets,You look young! That’s not terrible it could be worse and you could look like u/richtofin115
2021-04-21 20:14:45,wallstreetbets,"You could look like me. But then again, Tinder was the easiest thing I’ve ever done in my entire life so maybe that’s not a bad thing."
2021-04-21 20:10:04,wallstreetbets,No. I’m getting out soon. Waiting till it goes up a bit. I’ll always hold some but not to this degree
2021-04-22 19:00:41,wallstreetbets,Yeah. You’re gonna be poor. But my husband bought a fuk ton more TSLA in Jan. So you could be poor on that too
2021-04-22 17:02:47,wallstreetbets,Never heard of him 🥸
2021-04-22 17:08:02,wallstreetbets,"Okay... until we meet again, Larstim Norway 😞"
2021-04-22 17:01:09,wallstreetbets,They can also tell if you’re using the same accounts in the same app and they can tell if you’re using the same browser by device.
2021-04-22 18:10:35,wallstreetbets,"🤷🏻‍♀️

Edit: fuck"
2021-04-21 20:21:20,wallstreetbets,That would fucking suck. Lol
2021-04-21 21:06:20,wallstreetbets,"sold some of my soxl shares and palantir calls, so nothing big. looking to sell my dkng calls in the coming month"
2021-04-21 21:06:27,wallstreetbets,wbu?
2021-04-21 21:17:03,wallstreetbets,"That's fair, lol"
2021-04-22 17:06:54,wallstreetbets,I’m still up 700% 🤡
2021-04-22 17:35:29,wallstreetbets,It should at least be 3k by now 😔 Not even up 100% from the 2018 high
2021-04-22 19:22:53,wallstreetbets,He's not wrong
2021-04-22 10:31:57,wallstreetbets,GUH loll
2021-04-22 10:32:26,wallstreetbets,Hell yes I am
2021-04-21 20:06:06,wallstreetbets,This makes me so sad
2021-04-21 20:09:10,wallstreetbets,I don’t aim for “not terrible” 😭
2021-04-21 20:17:45,wallstreetbets,"I wanna look like myself, but I also wanna be better than “not terrible, could be worse”😤"
2021-04-21 20:12:36,wallstreetbets,Are you diversifying?🤡
2021-04-21 20:19:36,wallstreetbets,There were 30c call sweeps for may last week.  I jumped in.
2021-04-22 17:02:16,wallstreetbets,They didn’t do that for a friend of mine 🥸
2021-04-22 18:27:09,wallstreetbets,I see it
2021-04-21 20:23:01,wallstreetbets,I'm starting to be thankful for life's failures. I've learned all of my good lessons by fucking up. 90% of my lectures to coworkers and clients are stories about what not to do
2021-04-21 21:07:37,wallstreetbets,That SOXL worked out. Nice
2021-04-21 21:08:08,wallstreetbets,Nothing new just deep OTM VXX per usual
2021-04-22 17:07:19,wallstreetbets,🕵️But you didn't sell at the top 🕵️
2021-04-22 17:37:18,wallstreetbets,3k too low imo
2021-04-21 20:07:55,wallstreetbets,I knew what those were going to be and I clicked anyway lol
2021-04-21 20:10:13,wallstreetbets,That’s not what I meant! Omg k I’ll leave lol
2021-04-21 20:51:17,wallstreetbets,"That’s not what I meant! I was shit talking Rich it’s just a figure of speech. 😒

Could say that about anyone - example I could be worse I could look like u/richtofin115 etc etc"
2021-04-21 20:12:58,wallstreetbets,Diversification is for pussies and I’m not a pussy
2021-04-21 20:22:01,wallstreetbets,Good luck. It can really do anything or nothing all at the same time. Frustrating
2021-04-22 17:03:39,wallstreetbets,"I also think he literally commented that he did it to himself. Dead giveaway.

Your friend sounds hot tho he single"
2021-04-22 18:28:00,wallstreetbets,I know the edit was for you since I acknowledge automod would kill me
2021-04-21 20:28:50,wallstreetbets,Inverse everyone and ourselves.  Infinite loop of lessons
2021-04-21 21:16:07,wallstreetbets,might start joining you soon. i feel the rapture is coming 👀
2021-04-22 17:08:30,wallstreetbets,Good thing that wasn’t the top 😏

2021-04-21 20:11:47,wallstreetbets,😎 am I so predictable?

2021-04-21 20:14:34,wallstreetbets,Fannypackphantom = chad confirmed 😎
2021-04-22 18:28:36,wallstreetbets,It didn’t kill it this time lol
2021-04-21 20:30:11,wallstreetbets,The paradox of trying to inverse yourself is that you probably should have inversed the inverse so I decided to just ride the wave
2021-04-21 21:16:36,wallstreetbets,No the drop only happens when bears are ded
2021-04-22 17:09:58,wallstreetbets,"I'm LARPing, timing corn is really hard so I don't blame you holding

I can't imagine it's fun watching those numbers drop though"
2021-04-22 17:09:05,wallstreetbets,But you could've had more to buy the dip 😏
2021-04-22 17:40:37,wallstreetbets,Me too bb me too 😞

2021-04-22 01:44:06,wallstreetbets,"I requested access to C3.AI platform and was able to build ML models on my data within an hour.
I wasn’t able to get access to try Palantir.
So I went balls deep into $AI"
2021-04-22 14:00:31,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂😂😂
2021-04-22 14:03:29,wallstreetbets,"From what I have read it is all about licensing and US presence. I have never heard of Tilray operating in the US through other facets and this deal is supposed to, from what I understand, give them that access. I think there was also something to do with Aphrias connection to food products or something. This was a while ago. Im in 1/22 expiry  $30 strike at 275 a piece myself along with the same expiry $85 strike at 90 a piece. Theyre good long term thats for sure."
2021-04-22 17:23:33,wallstreetbets,Attorney here. I would not base a decision on this cursory overview of a law firm's practice or how a defendant in another suit (Tesla) is doing now.
2021-04-22 00:09:22,wallstreetbets,Time to sell a covered call and reduce basis!
2021-04-22 09:00:32,wallstreetbets,Bought in a $60 but averaged down to about $44 now. To the moon baby
2021-04-21 22:28:21,wallstreetbets,"Thank you again for post! Glad I listened, just sold for more than 20% gains today :D"
2021-04-22 04:57:42,wallstreetbets,Lol that's so petty :))))))
