2021-06-09 19:55:55,wallstreetbets,Exactly- why is the top tier company being bet so heavily against? Clear manipulation the last 2 years.

2021-06-09 19:35:01,wallstreetbets,The desperation is strong. WSB used to be a beacon of retardation - now it’s just a bunch of stupid people.
2021-06-09 19:45:37,wallstreetbets,You could also be wrong.

2021-06-09 19:58:03,wallstreetbets,"Sold my June18c today, is this the move? Should I rebuy Dec calls… 🤔"
2021-06-09 19:09:58,wallstreetbets,leaps are dangerous with the IV right now
2021-06-09 19:07:08,wallstreetbets,I had CLOV december/jan calls as well. Sold it all today/yesterday.
2021-06-09 19:35:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm thinking of selling covered calls for 12/2021 20c
2021-06-09 19:14:06,wallstreetbets,Good write up but fuck Chamath.

2021-06-09 19:21:16,wallstreetbets,I used to own this before I sold it to buy something more exciting.
2021-06-09 19:40:11,wallstreetbets,Bought the dip this morning 88 @ 16.2.  Hopped off CLOV at the top we in the WKHS army now! LETS GO!
2021-06-09 19:18:44,wallstreetbets,🐎🐎🐎🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕
2021-06-09 19:38:06,wallstreetbets,And still so heavily shorted. I have big expectations about the next few days 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-09 19:00:58,wallstreetbets,Is it gonna keep running tomorrow though?
2021-06-09 19:01:11,wallstreetbets,Run MFer run!
2021-06-09 19:53:43,wallstreetbets,Let’s ggoooooo
2021-06-09 19:43:41,wallstreetbets,Gonna load up on more tomorrow morning!
2021-06-09 19:07:43,wallstreetbets,Now why you gotta hide Momma’s ARKK from us?
2021-06-09 19:57:16,wallstreetbets,"It is the Highest Short Stock on the Market!  Shitadel Shorted it big time.  Apes are coming in full blast. Also, has HUGE growth potential!!  Love this STOCK..  I AM A WORSHIPER OF THE HORSE GOD!![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval)"
2021-06-09 19:16:09,wallstreetbets,Unhide other positions or ban
2021-06-09 19:03:04,wallstreetbets,"Look at the call volume for 6/11 and 6/18 week. Huge volume near in the money and could be a catalyst. That being said, if I Knew, I wouldn't be here..."
2021-06-09 19:08:34,wallstreetbets,Was ashamed of my 2.51%
2021-06-09 19:19:06,wallstreetbets,Arkk and AMC Aug puts.
2021-06-09 19:11:05,wallstreetbets,So what's the plan chief ?
2021-06-09 19:12:54,wallstreetbets,"If anything it would go the other way. The people selling you those calls are the ones moving the market. With high call volume coming up, max pain would likely be below those strikes. 

WKHS is a bad stock that lost the USPS deal and also has been struggling with their Lordstown investment. I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole, but that is just me"
2021-06-09 19:43:56,wallstreetbets,AMC puts watch out man the AMC gang gonna come egg your house or fuck your wife
2021-06-09 19:18:39,wallstreetbets,Pray to baby Jesus
2021-06-09 19:38:31,wallstreetbets,They aren't investing in Lordstown. They sold intellectual property to them in exchange for a 10% stake in the company and a license fee for each vehicle that Lordstown produces. They also have the option to use some of Lordstowns production facility as they gear up. They have plenty of orders to keep them going outside of the USPS contract and are still very likely to get a portion of the USPS contract.
2021-06-09 19:55:41,wallstreetbets,I had thought about that but there are worse things to be called than honest.
2021-06-09 19:56:48,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, I see what you've done for other people, and I want that for me 🙏 Amen."
2021-06-09 19:54:33,wallstreetbets,I'll never understand where people got the idea that $WKHS used a cash investment for stake... lol
2021-06-09 18:57:31,wallstreetbets,"Riding the nuke all the way down, waving that bedazzled cowboy hat with assless chaps cupping your magnificent testicles. Well done sir."
2021-06-09 19:08:51,wallstreetbets,I want to see what you’re hiding under those scribbles. 🤔
2021-06-09 19:04:08,wallstreetbets,Not bad but i think you should buy calls now.... Additional funding coming through!
2021-06-09 19:50:03,wallstreetbets,"RIDE deserves a fighting chance.   Shorting this company is shorting both the environment and America.   Moreover, its shorting the hard working peeps around Lordstown who are trying to build something great (after loosing so many jobs in the area).    

Before shorting, check yourself and your values.   

In the end, the company will do just fine, but it would do better if the stock was allowed to trend upwards & they could raise some capital."
2021-06-09 19:07:29,wallstreetbets,Nice work.
2021-06-09 18:58:17,wallstreetbets,"Bought 10 $15.00 put contracts yesterday afternoon for $800.00. Sold them this morning for $5390, so pretty happy with my first put purchase.

With how much the stock ran up on the last week, I figured it was due for a correction, their press release last night was an unexpected surprise to say the least 🙂"
2021-06-09 18:57:19,wallstreetbets,My Puts are not doing well....wrong strike I guess
2021-06-09 19:34:26,wallstreetbets,Short attack on ride left a lot of retail investors lose money. It was coordinated efforts by the shorts and Media recycling old news. This is totally outrageous and needs some spanking...... Bad short bad shorts![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)
2021-06-09 18:57:38,wallstreetbets,you think it’s going back down i bought 2 9p 6/18 for the hell of it earlier
2021-06-09 19:40:32,wallstreetbets,Selling puts is a risky business. Good luck to you! Keep crushing it.
2021-06-09 19:03:04,wallstreetbets,I heard Lordstown Motors is a fraudulent company. What happened to those reports?
2021-06-09 19:03:23,wallstreetbets,"This might be the best compliment I've received in a long time, thanks!

Just goes to show there's money to be made on the ride up, and on the way down too."
2021-06-09 19:10:07,wallstreetbets,"Oh it's just cancelled sell orders, sorry nothing exciting. The ones I actually sold are all on the pic"
2021-06-09 19:07:12,wallstreetbets,"We'll see, I fell like it's more likely to trend downward than up in the short time. Just gonna wait and see for awhile"
2021-06-09 18:59:15,wallstreetbets,😱
2021-06-09 19:13:25,wallstreetbets,Some of the lower dollar amount puts spiked like crazy right after the announcement. The timing was pretty tight to profit though
2021-06-09 19:38:29,wallstreetbets,"Um what? This was a reaction to the company putting out a statement saying that they might not be able to continue unless they got additional financing, and they weren't sure they could. This tanked due to fundamentals, it's not some short seller conspiracy"
2021-06-09 19:00:39,wallstreetbets,It looks like a lot of people bought the dip when it was in the 9's earlier. I don't think there will be major movement this week but who knows
2021-06-09 19:43:52,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I actually bought puts, then sold them to take the profits. I'd need to do a lot more research to feel comfortable selling puts."
2021-06-09 19:05:42,wallstreetbets,Not sure it's a fraud but they did misrepresent some figures on their financial statements. Stock tanked because they said they aren't sure they can secure financing for production.
2021-06-09 19:20:04,wallstreetbets,Lol okay. I wanted to know the secrets you were hiding. Thank you! 😂
2021-06-09 19:46:25,wallstreetbets,"Congrats, just a dollar and day late...IV pretty violate still, my Puts might come back to life..."
2021-06-09 19:50:27,wallstreetbets,"Well, it was pre-coordinated short attack with Media.

But congrats on profits, but I think you should sell your puts. I also bought 100 calls when it hit 9.50. 

This was a fud and recycled news that already was hammered on and now is history again. 

Lordstown has now 30k prepaid order and 100k none bindinf order. They also built all the beta and passed crash tests. Although they need some more testing, but they are having investor week starting from 21st. Furthermore, they will start their preproduction in July. They parts up to 1000 cars. But to make 2000 cars which was their goal this year, they need more funding. This was notthing new and old story.

2021-06-09 19:47:11,wallstreetbets,"ahhh - well in that case, not nearly as risky of a business. good job to you!"
2021-06-09 19:12:58,wallstreetbets,They just need to raise more capital which is not really a problem. FUD as always
2021-06-09 19:17:16,wallstreetbets,"Embrace the FUD! Let it flow through you, power you!"
2021-06-09 19:18:47,wallstreetbets,Not FUD from you. More like the medias and hedges like always. But hey.. i’m glad you were able to surf it

2021-06-09 18:46:05,wallstreetbets,honestly I look at the daily thread and watch out for tickers that people mention that look new and aren't super spammed yet and if it hasn't gone up more than 2-5% I jump in
2021-06-09 18:45:02,wallstreetbets,Agreed

2021-06-09 18:36:07,wallstreetbets,"Basically betting the stock will be a certain price by a certain date. You can make a lot with very minor movements but if you're wrong you can lose your whole investment. Lookup options contracts, and then spend a very long time studying how they operate and maybe doing a few very small plays that you're willing to lose everything on just to test it out."
2021-06-09 18:37:55,wallstreetbets,"I'm new to options but not terribly new to stocks (compared to some anyway). A call is an option.
The way over simplified explanation is that options are like insurance.

If you buy a call, you are buying the right to buy shares for a certain price. So if it goes up, you make money

If you buy a put you are buying the right to sell shares at a certain price. So if it goes down you make money

You can also become the insurance person; people pay you a premium to reserve the right to buy or sell:

Sell a call and you are obligated to sell at a certain price. Price goes down, you keep the premium.

Sell a put and you are obligated to buy at a certain price. Price goes up, you keep the premium.

It is much more complicated than that but that's the basic idea. People almost never exercise options, can't even find an explanation for when you would... They sell the option that they had bought.

Just for upvote Yolo because apparently that's all it takes in life: Crayons, Apes, Rockets

Edit to avoid confusion as it was brought to my attention by someone:

When you sell a call or put you get to keep the premium they paid you for that right either way, but you may have to buy shares at an unfavorable price"

2021-06-09 19:12:10,wallstreetbets,Is this a better way to make money than just buying/selling shares?
2021-06-09 19:13:58,wallstreetbets,Is there some reason they don't just exercise the option?
2021-06-09 18:28:18,wallstreetbets,Sell knowledge on gambling?
2021-06-09 19:18:37,wallstreetbets,"It can be because you have more leverage. 1 option is worth 100 shares for a lot less money. But if it doesn't go your way, you have nothing or close to it. When you buy shares, you can still sell those. Also, the premium changes as the option changes in value, so you can lose big and fast .


Better is subjective anyway. So far, I am a big fan of the wheel strategy on monthly dividend stocks.
Sell puts till you get assigned, then sell calls till the shares sell. Collect dividends the whole time you have it. It's slower but pretty safe."
2021-06-09 19:25:20,wallstreetbets,I think it has to do with cost. I can buy a single call on 100 shares of AMC or GME for relatively cheap (sort of... The premium would kill it) but the cost of 100 shares direct would kill me on my total account. So they just sell the option rather than actually buy 100 shares then sell them
2021-06-09 18:29:32,wallstreetbets,"Lol, yes. Capitalism bro"
2021-06-09 19:51:59,wallstreetbets,Oh that makes sense.

2021-06-09 19:23:06,wallstreetbets,Dude I bought WISH in the high 20’s and never stopped buying. I was literally getting butt hurt about it. And buying long option calls and getting straight cracked. But I’m back and I know this bish is going to pop. I have a post.

2021-06-09 18:24:43,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean? You bought the stock and it immediately went from 14 to 10? 

I am aware of the typo."

2021-06-09 18:04:46,wallstreetbets,Been bullish on INO for a while just like I am with MRNA while people laughed me.
2021-06-09 17:54:46,wallstreetbets,Nice job explaining
2021-06-09 18:14:48,wallstreetbets,"Great DD! This is a super long play, right? Clinical trials take years to perform. So this is like 5 years out, minimum, right?"
2021-06-09 17:50:08,wallstreetbets,Strike and Exp doc
2021-06-09 17:55:16,wallstreetbets,Hypospray. They made a mfing hypospray.
2021-06-09 18:47:54,wallstreetbets,"I'll watch for right now. Every Pharma company is jumping balls deep into new modalities (mRNA, siRNA, gene therapy delivery), it's good that they have stuff in the clinical pipeline - but 95% of that shit fails. Not to mention, bigger companies have deeper pockets to pursue more avenues"
2021-06-09 18:26:03,wallstreetbets,No thanks
2021-06-09 19:55:38,wallstreetbets,Sir I think you misspelled NIO

Companies like this that focus on the science and ignore creating products that are within immediate reach by applying the latest research I avoid as they don't make money. Want a profitable biotech with a big future, go for ABCL."
2021-06-09 18:36:59,wallstreetbets,So they branched off of the covid vaccines and found something to treat incurable diseases? Am I understanding this correctly?
2021-06-09 18:43:14,wallstreetbets,"How have you interacted with Weiner, D? 🧐"
2021-06-09 18:50:05,wallstreetbets,Any short term price prediction for a short term ape?
2021-06-09 18:02:28,wallstreetbets,What is dah fraud aboot bruh?
2021-06-09 18:07:05,wallstreetbets,Weiner's out for INO. It'll catch on any minute.
2021-06-09 18:13:29,wallstreetbets,Picked up a bunch of MRNA when a friend who is the chief medical officer for a hospital came over and told me to.
2021-06-09 18:06:41,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-06-09 18:39:42,wallstreetbets,Possibly. They are already in phase 3 for their HPV vaccine with an expected completion around July 2022. But I think positive result from that will be seen by many as proof of concept and the valuation will increase beyond the value of that treatment.
2021-06-09 18:36:25,wallstreetbets,Based on the design of the trials can make our break a great product. I watched a wonderdrug get the FDA axe because a research site (private) manipulated the data. It was awful to watch.
2021-06-09 18:06:17,wallstreetbets,"I don't have any experience in making price targets, but FWIW, I feel like 1/21/2022 20Cs are decent value. It might be worth waiting to see if this current hot streak cools off before buying though."
2021-06-09 19:03:19,wallstreetbets,"I disagree, they have multiple products currently undergoing trials. Not sure what you're on about."
2021-06-09 18:50:40,wallstreetbets,"Not quite, they were already developing this for other diseases then COVID hit and brought the tech to the forefront. It just so happens that it works for COVID. Part of what makes them valuable is that they're already ahead of the game on applying the tech to other treatments."
2021-06-09 18:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Probably not, the Covid RNA strand is specially designed to bind to the antigen binding region of the spike protein of the Covid virus. They can take the blueprint of that conjugate and switch around the amino acids - to hopefully help with incurable diseases, but it's a long shot. Over a million different amino acid combinations, so the likelihood of them guessing correctly is slim. Plus 95% of all projects never make it out of clinical trials, either because toxicity/efficacy/or cost."
2021-06-09 18:07:41,wallstreetbets,I’ll be pressing pickle with the rest of them
2021-06-09 19:04:52,wallstreetbets,Dope

2021-06-09 19:12:27,wallstreetbets,Might wanna roll out those options or something. If you set a limit order you might catch break even during the morning spike if there is one again. We have a couple weeks till earnings and there may be a continuous increase leading up to it. Probably why it hasn’t tanked.
2021-06-09 17:47:32,wallstreetbets,You're at least posting your fucking position.

2021-06-09 19:02:00,wallstreetbets,BB better run big in next 2 days or contracts dead. So you know how to trade options? If not buying shares is better for you....
2021-06-09 19:02:13,wallstreetbets,"I like BB. It's been a long play of mine for a while, and if I were in your shoes I'd still feel good about it."

2021-06-09 18:54:33,wallstreetbets,CLOV was a distraction. Congratulations to those of you that YOLO’d and got out. Those of you that bought high....Well....

2021-06-09 18:07:03,wallstreetbets,You’re retarded
2021-06-09 18:40:16,wallstreetbets,Did you read anything or just see the letters CLOV? I’m not a smart person but you make me look smart.
2021-06-09 19:06:43,wallstreetbets,Those that say CLOV is done obviously don’t pay attention to trends.
2021-06-09 17:48:47,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-06-09 17:47:19,wallstreetbets,it's in the name 🚀
2021-06-09 18:38:20,wallstreetbets,"it will, i dont doubt that"
2021-06-09 18:56:48,wallstreetbets,so lame
2021-06-09 17:48:01,wallstreetbets,They own 500k of Clov and 700k of AMC what’s your point. Those aren’t large enough numbers to make systemic shifts.
2021-06-09 17:45:10,wallstreetbets,"Wow , that’s hell’s impressive haha . I have a question what does the call price mean over the strike price … I really want to buy options but don’t understand them at all"
2021-06-09 19:09:50,wallstreetbets,"Same to you bud. Hole you got some too. Keep your stick on the ice. 
I am no expert in this game. But I just follow the fundamentals of the Ape community. Team work is the survival skill. 🙂"
2021-06-09 18:31:10,wallstreetbets,That's a compliment
2021-06-09 18:20:47,wallstreetbets,Howcome? Is it over?
2021-06-09 18:47:00,wallstreetbets,????
2021-06-09 18:53:27,wallstreetbets,"Ya man..we just have to hold sometime. sometime I hold for a three month and then boom...I made $5000.
I did that with Schlumberger.  Fuck man."

2021-06-09 18:02:16,wallstreetbets,Don’t buy if you don’t understand. It’s a good way to lose a lot of money. What you don’t see is the 99% of people who have lost a lot of money
2021-06-09 17:48:44,wallstreetbets,On a call option the strike price is the price you can buy the stock for if you choose to excercise. So if at expiration you have a $20 strike price and the stock rockets upto $100 you can buy 100 shares of that $100 stock for $20 per sharw. So you make $80 per share. Majority of people choose to just sell the option tho. Which depending on the time value has also gone up significantly in price.
2021-06-09 17:48:45,wallstreetbets,Call price is how much each option costs. If you see $1.19 it means 100 shares x $1.19 = $119 for the option.
2021-06-09 18:18:01,wallstreetbets,"Before you get too carried away, ask him if he got into clov before it moved or he just joined the other apes and was smart enough to sell. People like to post gains from stocks everyone else is meming into. When someone posts gains from a stock that no is talking about, then maybe that person has some talent. Not trying to be an ass. Just want to keep it in perspective. It’s real easy to lose perspective here. Gain money think you are the best in the world (even if it is just meme chasing). Lose money feel like dying. Keep your wits about you."
2021-06-09 18:48:34,wallstreetbets,😘
2021-06-09 19:16:35,wallstreetbets,"He sold his CLOV and put it on RKT, you’re over here hyping CLOV."
2021-06-09 18:32:53,wallstreetbets,They own more AMC and GME than they do CLOV. Simple as that.
2021-06-09 18:33:53,wallstreetbets,"Hear me out … 500k shares on the current volume doesn’t move it an inch. The media chases news stories like a sugar riddled child with ADD. AMC has been in the cycles for weeks. Not everything is a conspiracy. Correlation is not causation, etc, etc, etc."
2021-06-09 19:56:23,wallstreetbets,Seriously bro..this.  Spend at least 6 months learning reading and practicing simulations or something  with options different strikes dates and combinations before playing with real money. It won’t guarantee your success but it will make you feel like you have a shot. Better than finding about all the different strategies after all your money is gone.  That feeling sucks!
2021-06-09 17:52:26,wallstreetbets,I heard selling the contract is better than exercising
2021-06-09 17:53:44,wallstreetbets,How do you exercise?
2021-06-09 17:56:14,wallstreetbets,What does the call price mean ? Because I see $2 calls and a $8.00 strike price
2021-06-09 18:28:25,wallstreetbets,I bought last Thursday pre hype but call option were same price Monday market open when clov was 9$
2021-06-09 19:04:12,wallstreetbets,What do you think the future holds for CLOV? are we still in for the squeeze or Gama squeeze?
2021-06-09 17:53:29,wallstreetbets,depends on your investing strategy
2021-06-09 18:19:04,wallstreetbets,It is if you can’t afford to buy the shares
2021-06-09 18:12:09,wallstreetbets,Free weights and exercise bike
2021-06-09 18:06:52,wallstreetbets,It varies by broker. You may have to call or they may do it automatically
2021-06-09 18:51:46,wallstreetbets,"How do you buy call option,i never try it."
2021-06-09 19:42:50,wallstreetbets, I have no idea. Some people really shit on the stock. If you have some profit at least take out the investment and let it ride if you want.
2021-06-09 18:55:27,wallstreetbets,You have to apply for options trading through your broker but it takes like 30 seconds and just about everyone gets approved
2021-06-09 19:02:19,wallstreetbets,"Oh..ok. haha. I am so green and I am already running with the herds. Made a bundle too. But if you ask me about trade options, like puts and calls. I don't have a clue. Thks"
2021-06-09 17:51:33,wallstreetbets,"I’m in for 400 shares at 7.90 cost basis. Been holding that for a couple months. Yesterday I tried to get into 100 July $15 calls for .05, but order never went through. Today those same calls are worth .55. Just missed out on an easy 10x. Today I bought 20 Jan ‘22 $17 calls at $1.00. This stock is criminally undervalued and right now there is still very little hype. Once this thing starts to hit fomo prices the narrative on this sub is going to change really quick."

2021-06-09 18:43:31,wallstreetbets,Why did you want to buy yesterday. Something specific or just under valued? Thanks. I own a 100 shares and thought of adding another 100. It seems to have found a new level of support these last few days.
2021-06-09 17:57:04,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE ONE EVERYONE GET IN
2021-06-09 19:41:21,wallstreetbets,Same as you @45 shares but I have 6 calls. 8/9c 6/18 and four 11c 7/16. I may sell the 8/9c next week and roll it over to August calls.
2021-06-09 18:26:46,wallstreetbets,"no it isn’t, UWMC is a way better company.. not even comparable"
2021-06-09 19:09:47,wallstreetbets,Yup bought today 15c expiring 8/20 at open for 0.49 and they closed at 0.75. Was at 1.38 at some point too but held cause its only the beginning.

2021-06-09 17:54:24,wallstreetbets,"I’m sleeping in my car tonight at the rest area down the highway because wife threw me out over WISH. It was either sell or sleep in the car, really an easy decision. 💎🙌"
2021-06-09 18:02:15,wallstreetbets,"Look man. I have a shit job and barely anything in savings. I'm up to my eyeballs in debt now, and I'm hoping things turn around for me. I took what I had left in savings and put it all in WISH this morning at 13.50 in the hopes that by some miracle I'm not going to have to spend the rest of my damned life eating cat food. I am down 20% and won't make my mortgage payment if this bet doesn't pay off. Shit can get bad, but one day isn't going to be the deciding factor in any of this.

If you think that an 9% drop is too much, then cut your losses. You're showing us 20x in assets what I've managed to save over the last 53 years. There are other places to put that money.

I'm not saying things don't look bad. But things are never as bad as they seem."

You need to be stronger than that for your children. Take a deep breath, look up and move forward man. Those kids need their daddy!!!!"

As a father I can tell you that the only thing the kids want or need from you is knowing they still have a father. Trust me on that. So if you divorce go get your equitable share of parenting time and love those kids. That's all they will want. And as far as your ex taking them..tell her to lawyer up because you have the right to shared custody etc.all kinds of parenting schedules these days I have my daughter 3 of the 4 weekends each month and every other Wednesday overnight. 

see you on the moon."

2021-06-09 18:07:21,wallstreetbets,"Wish management has the following long term financial targets: 

-25-30% (of revenue) Cost of goods sold
-40-45% sales & marketing expense
-8-9% Gen & Admin expense

This implies long term net income margins of 16-27%. Analysts believe they will continue to grow revenue by 20-25% per year over the next several years.

Looking out 5 years to 2026 if we assume conservatively: 

-19% annual revenue growth from 2021 projected $3.2 billion 

-15% net income margin in 2026

-We get $7.64 billion in revenue & $1.146 billion non gaap net income. Put a 25-30 multiple on that and you’ve blasted off wayyyy past the moon 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Wish is a guaranteed multi bagger & not many people realize it. Joe realizes it tho"

2021-06-09 19:44:03,wallstreetbets,Demand is travel is coming but it’s the business class fares that actually make them $$. Crossing my fingers.
2021-06-09 18:45:20,wallstreetbets,"Airlines are a tough bet. Lots of debt and there’s no guarantees that business travel is coming back soon. I’m hoping it does though cuz I own UAL, AAL, and DAL."
2021-06-09 17:33:45,wallstreetbets,This is why we hodl.....down $7k today.....still FUKN hodlin
2021-06-09 17:32:18,wallstreetbets,"Have to say today was a frustrating day with CLOV. If people weren't so easily scared off the squeeze could have continued today.

A large portion of the float is tied up. Institutions and insiders hold over 40% of the float and since the company went publicly recently the shares are still short term so can't be easily traded.

The stock is heavily shorted with the last report at 41% and the past few days most likely meant more borrowed shares.

Short borrow fees are over 100% with little to no shares available. Most shorts got in when the price was low and in some cases they will be at double right now, so more than they bargained for.

If we hit $22 by EOW over 200,000 calls are in the money which would push a gamma squeeze.

What makes it attractive is the low public float at a reasonable price. Trading 500 million shares of CLOV costs a third of what it would need for AMC. The call options are already purchased and just waiting to be used so setting up a gamma squeeze doesn't require a high cost of entry like GME and AMC. 

This is not financial advice so I would love to hear your thoughts on the case for CLOV this week."
2021-06-09 19:09:02,wallstreetbets,"For those of you holding CLOV that are freaking out, I suggest you read up on the Elliot Wave theory. Major uptrends in stock price happen in 5 major waves. The first wave is the impulsive wave, the first breakout to the upside which shows the start of an uptrend. Then the second wave is the first correction wave. The correction wave in an uptrend is usually around 40-60 percent of the length of the impulsive wave. Then we get in to the third wave, the second impulsive wave, which is normally the wave with the most upside. Then the second corrective wave, then the last impulsive wave. Which totals to 3 major waves. Now with this in mind, give the CLOV chart a look. You will notice right away it appears we had the first major impulsive wave from 13to 28. That was the break of the sideways trend and the start of the uptrend. That is a 124  percent move up. Now if we look at the recent pullback that trolls want to call a “crash” there was a 50 percent move to the downside. That pullback is about in the range of the 40-60 percent of the length of the move up, sound familiar right? Now with signs of a bottom of 15.9, MACD curling up and breaking out to the upside on the 30 minute chart, and price currently at 17.15 at the time of writing this, we are seeing signs the second impulsive wave has just started. Trolls love to say the clov run is over, but in reality this is just the definition of an uptrend. This pullback was healthy and expected to continue the move up. As for the short squeeze, with the short fee now at a record high of 116 percent (I have never seen the fee that high for any stock before) I suspect shorts will start covering during the second impulsive wave up. Clov apes do not give in to the BS, we are right at the tip of the short squeeze and to give up now would be stupid.

Will be interesting to see there move tomorrow, will they try to cover some of do they think they can drive it down more and scare people off?

2021-06-09 19:29:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that played a part but I think the opening short caused that type of reaction. When people saw the drop some pulled money which led to fear dumping which led people to think it was over. When it loses a third of it's value it's hard to convince people everything is alright.
Premarket was going strong bringing the price up to $28 with 10 million in volume, not much more we could ask for to kick things off."

I've saw different sets of numbers for short interest on both and borrowing fees  and it looks to me that they are both set up to be squeezed in the next week.

There’s somewhat overlap from previous day being factored in during pre-market and at market open. With saying that- what happened with CLOV and Wish today? Opened up good but within an hour I believe they were back to around even for the day. 

That’s just something I’ve come to observe."

2021-06-09 19:30:10,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the post!  I admit I’m still figuring all of this out but I’m spending a lot of time learning what I can. I really thought today would rebound after the initial dip but either too many people sold or it was just a pump and dump and I missed the time to get out. I’m holding now because I don’t have many shares and perhaps it will go up (over a long time period) or in the next few weeks! 🤷🏻 No point in selling really since this was all money I said I was comfortable losing as opposed to my long term investments.

2021-06-09 18:22:22,wallstreetbets,"the big myth here is that 'shorts are forced to cover'. 

That only happens with retail investors. So the narrative that a short covering event will eventually happen is a false narrative in my opinion."
2021-06-09 18:39:55,wallstreetbets,"Check Ortex tomorrow, SI is going to be off the charts. Yeah maybe they can try to press a stock down with massive shorts (even if I guess shorting shares they haven't found, but it is not criminal if they find them within 48 hours just to get this right), but they ARE selling borrowed shares short massively today. They are digging a hole.

Let's not get conspiratorial and try to keep our facts straight for our fellow retards. WSB right now has just been an ape pool of ""This stock is a distraction. No that one is giving the HF's a free lunch."" The fact of the reality today is it was massively sold short and apes successfully created their own FUD because of a small long position by citadel and probably lost a lot of noobs their money.

God Speed.

Correction - Saw the author replied and I don't see the message. Wasn't calling your post a conspiracy, I was just making a general comment of the state of WSB on this crazy day. Appreciate the DD."

2021-06-09 17:26:12,wallstreetbets,">In violation of the short sale restriction someone continued to short into the bid going into AH.

What restriction. Shorts can still short on SSR.

Sure. Lots of shorts piled in but the price went down end of day because people sold out. That's just how it goes. Price goes down. People get scared. People sell. Shorts just piling onto that demand to make sure the price doesn't go up leading more people to sell.

Repeat. And that's it."

2021-06-09 17:29:47,wallstreetbets,"Shorts can still technically short sell after the SSR has been tripped, they just can't sell into the bid side of the spread. It needs to be in the uptick."
2021-06-09 19:34:01,wallstreetbets,"The majority of the decrease in price was fabricated, and not many people actually selling. The daily volume was well over 300 million. Paper hands doesn't account for that, and only a few hundred thousand shares at most were actually returned. What we saw today was mostly shorts selling back and forth to each other at lower and lower prices in hopes of triggering stop losses so they could buy up paper handed shares. They didn't actually get much though."
2021-06-09 18:26:55,wallstreetbets,"I generally agree with you though there are some semantics involved. As you notice I say they would need to cover at some point with borrowing fees so high. What I'm basically saying is that with those fees so high at some point it becomes cheaper to just cover the position instead of holding the position in hopes of closing at a lower strike price. You are mostly correct with the exception of failure to delivers, recalls, margin increases that can't be met, etc. Share lenders do occasionally force a borrower to close a short position. But this does not happen nearly as often as people seem to think that it does."
2021-06-09 19:31:25,wallstreetbets,Short selling into the bid after SSR had been tripped.
2021-06-09 17:29:04,wallstreetbets,"They can still short, but not into the bid side of the spread which is why it is called the uptick rule."
2021-06-09 17:29:41,wallstreetbets,No they can’t short into the bid they can only place a short as an ask.  That’s dangerous because if there’s buying momentum they be losing hard.
2021-06-09 17:45:52,wallstreetbets,"I remember there's a rule that they cannot short if the stock goes down for 2 straight days,  so if  it keeps going down then the best time to fight back is tomorrow afternoon the nearest to close time right?"
2021-06-09 19:50:57,wallstreetbets,"No, as I just mentioned in another response here there has been way too much of that lately setting completely unrealistic expectations. Because this is obviously a short squeeze Play and nothing more it would be silly to insist I or anyone else may have some insight regarding a price target. Dates that may see short covering can be predicted to some degree because of short return settlement dates, but even then there are ways they have been avoiding that as well."

Might stick to companies I'm more well informed on in the future but happy to hold in the meantime :). What is your personal hope with CLOV?  That it goes higher than the high and then sell?  Why didn't you take profits yesterday early today?  Thanks for sharing!
2021-06-09 19:16:29,wallstreetbets,"Semantics it is then thanks. Agree in principle that if the stock stays above a short position for an extended period of time, its bad for the owner of the short. I think though there is a prevailing myth running rampant in this casino that short squeezes are a common thing when in fact they are quite rare. Pressure on stock prices happens in both directions between profit takers (sellers) and buyers (short closes or just stake increases). We all want the pressure to be in an dramatic imbalance in our favor depending on the positions we individually take - but this shit is complicated with dozens of variables. And retail schleps like us are poorly armed to time these things in general."
2021-06-09 19:49:23,wallstreetbets,I was just watching what's her name's Mrs Naked Short sellers interview on cnbc and it seems like the SEC doesn't really have the resources to pursue everything even if brought to light and it takes years.

2021-06-09 17:32:13,wallstreetbets,"I don't know why you think it would be any more dangerous than regular short selling, it's a very common practice used to suppress the price to the strike that they had achieved prior to the SSR tripping so that they can try to continue to accumulate shares at that price to cover or reopen new positions with once the SSR has been lifted and they can continue selling into the bid."
2021-06-09 19:47:59,wallstreetbets,"I took some profits, and I hedged with some puts. I didn't post this because I lost my ass or anything, just trying to inform and clarify some things for people. 

I'm not going to speculate on price target however, too much of that going on around here lately and it's worthless. It only ever seems to set unrealistic expectations that is harmful to those who can't discern between reasonable DD and actual bullshit, and that's not cool. If there were some predictable trend here that would be a little different, but this is absolutely a short squeeze Play and nothing more. Because of that what happens tomorrow or any of the following days is anyone's guess. Somebody who is very well informed could make some vague predictions based upon short settlement dates and that's something that I'll be looking for, but even that is not enough for anybody who cares about credibility to make a prediction imo."
2021-06-09 19:23:45,wallstreetbets,"Couldn't agreed more, well said. I just wanted to clarify a few things if the goal is to explain to people they have unrealistic expectations."
2021-06-09 19:51:55,wallstreetbets,"Yup, and they make it incredibly difficult to report it. But you better believe if you break any SEC rules that cost the big boys money they'll be following up with you. Funny how that works isn't it?"

2021-06-09 19:56:21,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Anytime a conversation like this comes up I'm reminded of the quote from Westworld, ""This world isn't made for us, it's made for them.""

I'd be willing to bet that the vast majority of the new traders coming into Wall Street bets do not have the the money to avoid pattern day trade restrictions, and the SEC will tell you that it's to protect you. But I can't remember the last time I heard someone say that they were grateful for their inability to exit a position when it was best for them. Preventing you from minimizing losses or taking gains is somehow protecting you."
2021-06-09 18:12:57,wallstreetbets,You quit it with that logic! 🤣
2021-06-09 17:37:19,wallstreetbets,"You don’t have to. You try to short as ask instead of into the bid while the stock is upward momentum then you can comeback here and tell me how he went.

2021-06-09 17:41:44,wallstreetbets,"You're under the assumption that there is upward momentum, but because they are still allowed to sell in the uptick they can prevent upward momentum. That's exactly the point that I was trying to make."

2021-06-09 17:45:04,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about? I'm not shorting anything. I'm explaining how a short hedge can still short into the spread to suppress upward momentum once the SSR has been tripped. Ffs

2021-06-09 17:36:06,wallstreetbets,"Have to say today was a frustrating day with CLOV. If people weren't so easily scared off the squeeze could have continued today.

A large portion of the float is tied up. Institutions and insiders hold over 40% of the float and since the company went publicly recently the shares are still short term so can't be easily traded.

The stock is heavily shorted with the last report at 41% and the past few days most likely meant more borrowed shares.

Short borrow fees are over 100% with little to no shares available. Most shorts got in when the price was low and in some cases they will be at double right now, so more than they bargained for.

If we hit $22 by EOW over 200,000 calls are in the money which would push a gamma squeeze.

What makes it attractive is the low public float at a reasonable price. Trading 500 million shares of CLOV costs a third of what it would need for AMC. The call options are already purchased and just waiting to be used so setting up a gamma squeeze doesn't require a high cost of entry like GME and AMC. 

This is not financial advice so I would love to hear your thoughts on the case for CLOV this week."

2021-06-09 19:54:17,wallstreetbets,"Haha what a load of 💩, it was a pump and dump by citidel and you lot fell for it, all the unrealised losses for shorts yesterday are now no longer losses, i waited till it peaked and rode the crash down, citidel had $7 million of calls and $4 million of puts in CLOV so they could cash in on all you suckers on the way up and the way down, a simple Google search and a look on fintra would have told you it only started pumping after citidel filed their holdings on the 21/05/2021 not even 3 weeks ago."
2021-06-09 17:45:20,wallstreetbets,"this is nothing.

if the stock falls 20% in a day,

0.32% for a day trade is nothing

worth it short

if you shorted at open today, and rode all the way down, 

# you'd be up 40% even with the 117% borrow fee!"
2021-06-09 17:32:16,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I had the exact same sentiment. This is the first post I've written, as far as I can remember, and I've lurked here since when Tesla became the original meme stock. I was very surprised to see no other posts on it."
2021-06-09 17:41:07,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀👨‍🚀👩‍🚀🧑‍🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-09 17:38:54,wallstreetbets,I completely agree. Very well put. Let's hope it works out.
2021-06-09 18:51:21,wallstreetbets,40% by institutions isn’t unusually. It’s actually a little low.
2021-06-09 19:09:43,wallstreetbets,Variable
2021-06-09 17:28:42,wallstreetbets,"I did not expect to be explaining tables. There is this column where it says 'updated' at the top, and the cells below are filled with timestamps. These timestamps correspond to the numbers left of it. This means that yes, if you scroll down to yesterday, the borrowing fee was not that bad. Today, however, which I would argue is more important, it's at a monstrous 116.7%. This is an incredible indicator, as it tells us exactly how much shorts are paying right now."
2021-06-09 18:58:10,wallstreetbets,"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/amcs-meme-stock-traders-mess-with-corporate-theory-11623107259?mod=markets\_major\_pos11](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amcs-meme-stock-traders-mess-with-corporate-theory-11623107259?mod=markets_major_pos11)

CEO of AMC literally admitted that he's using reddit kids stock money to pay off debts - stock is worth about 2-6$ - you think that AMC is going to go up? with what?

AMC’s monthly cash burn was about $124 million in the fourth quarter. AMC managed to defer $450 million of rent obligations during the pandemic, but they start becoming due this year. The company is actively negotiating for rent abatements or additional deferrals to remain liquid.

AMC could manage to reduce its total obligation, but it’s hard to imagine the company’s landlords eliminating or even deferring rent much further — especially considering the company just raised north of $1 billion from equity and debt issuances, which is public information.

AMC has $5.8 billion of long-term debt — expensive debt that will further restrict future cash flows.

So how you think this company is going to fly north I have no idea. Movie business is dead - theaters will never return to what it was. Reddit kid money being used to pay debts - not investments. But yeah whatever hero you thinks going to push it to the sky go right ahead - but these ain't the movies."
2021-06-09 17:45:56,wallstreetbets,This guy is just spamming all Clover threads lol
2021-06-09 17:19:10,wallstreetbets,"That's alright, to each their own gamble"
2021-06-09 17:26:43,wallstreetbets,"Maybe personal profit is his goal, not your pet project of costing hedge funds money"
2021-06-09 17:25:12,wallstreetbets,You realise they own more of each GME and AMC than CLOV right?
2021-06-09 17:25:03,wallstreetbets,Citadel owns 500k CLOV shares. Volume traded today is 336 million. Do you see how what you're saying makes no sense?
2021-06-09 17:32:12,wallstreetbets,You’re beyond retarded
2021-06-09 17:49:12,wallstreetbets,LOL yet they own AMC and GME... 500k shares is nothing to the current volume. Nice try guy.
2021-06-09 18:43:12,wallstreetbets,Makes sense but they would have to buy back the shares right ? The only way they succeed is if after they short all apes and Institutions also dump meaning they can cover at lower price. If apes hold and buy that is when the squeeze will be on right ?
2021-06-09 17:32:30,wallstreetbets,"Ok I see that yes so basically it was just paper hands selling and longs / hf cashing in their gains all day. Why do so many assume the hf ONLY short? This is incorrect, they also acquire shares that aren’t shorted so I technically the stock could’ve just went down based on regular selling.. that does happen u know?"
2021-06-09 17:56:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah bc it’s the only ticker that made big bag holders. If you were lurking that bad you’d see I also provided advice to others and congratulated those that sold and secured profits. I also hold amc. Nothing is happening so I’m quiet on it. Simple explanation. Not everyone is acting in malicious intent. Instead you’re telling people to “hold the line”. Coaxing people into feeling good about holding bags.
2021-06-09 17:25:16,wallstreetbets,"Stop encouraging ppl to fomo, nothing you said is concrete and all speculation."
2021-06-09 19:59:40,wallstreetbets,"They're not called hedge funds for nothing, however amc and gme didn't go because of the HFs it went up because of apes, CLOV only started pumping after citidel filed their holdings of $7 million calls, $4 million puts and their 500k shares in CLOV which was filed on the 21/5/2021 not even 3 weeks ago, coincidence, I think not."
2021-06-09 17:41:46,wallstreetbets,"Paper hands and smart apes. The smart apes bought in days or weeks ago, theboaper handed ones are the ones that bought it in the last day and are now selling at a loss. As soon as I saw news articles saying Reddit lost its interest in CLOV, I figured it would be a day like this. Like GME and AMC, they all took big hits after their initial record highs.
But if history has taught us anything, it's that the Phoenix will rise again from the ashes. Stay strong fellow apes, trust the process."
2021-06-09 17:36:59,wallstreetbets,"Could have been for sure. Paper-hands, new shorts, and selling of open positions of other HF's are all undetermined parts of the drop in price. No idea which is the largest player. However, it is unlikely that the 43.54% short interest has been remotely covered, as the price has gone down, and the borrow fee rate is at this height. So no matter what caused the drop today, the data at hand tells us shorts are bleeding and plentiful, and that's all I need to know."
2021-06-09 18:36:38,wallstreetbets,"GME had loads of bag holders for months, apes holding at 350+ when the price dropped below 200. What is your point ? You do realise this is a zero sum game when one person wins the other loses."
2021-06-09 17:29:29,wallstreetbets,No it's really all rather fact-based. I could include the investopedia link to borrow fee rate if you'd like.
2021-06-09 17:39:47,wallstreetbets,Will be interesting to see the number tomorrow. I mean if the fee is over 100% they would need multiple down days that are big just to cover the fee? That’s before any assumed profit.. it’s a strange thing to see that’s for sure
2021-06-09 18:42:58,wallstreetbets,"And each time GME ran there were more sellers trying to sell bc they were holding bags at all price points. I know this is a zero sum game. It’s basically a prisoners dilemma. All I’m saying is stop making those who didn’t buy fomo,  and those who are bagholding to continue to hold losers. Everyone has to have their own exit strategy but I see that’s rare here."
2021-06-09 17:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Just a troll, don't waste your breath"
2021-06-09 17:54:29,wallstreetbets,"Agreed! I'm curious to see what tomorrow will bring. The main advantage of a high borrowing fee is that new shorts are unlikely to be opened, and old shorts are pressed to close their positions. The high borrowing fee implies that there currently are very few shares locatable to be sold short; there aren't many real shares left to be shorted."
2021-06-09 17:36:10,wallstreetbets,Wish is going to the Moon!!!! AH is green already.
2021-06-09 17:48:21,wallstreetbets,$wish added 60k at close

2021-06-09 17:35:16,wallstreetbets,With the lockup expiring later this month and only 10 percent  of float shorted currently...I don't see it tbh. But I'm just a retarded ape so don't listen to me

No reason amc fell like this but clov,bb,and aemd all the other shinny tickers they throw at us. I'm in AMC at 9.45 so ya keep creating bag holders and not winners."
2021-06-09 17:16:03,wallstreetbets,That average lmao
2021-06-09 17:44:36,wallstreetbets,"Hmmmm began posting yesterday, and literally has only discussed WISH, nothing strange there!"
2021-06-09 17:21:33,wallstreetbets,"WISH is a trap. WSB chatter on WISH is massively out of proportion to every other interest trend.

To those who bought the hype, good luck. I did, got out early. On further investigation there is some serious WSB fuckery happening with WISH."
2021-06-09 17:53:15,wallstreetbets,Lawsuit
2021-06-09 17:26:30,wallstreetbets,Wish is shit. You search for one thing and all other items that you're not looking for come up. 15% fee for sellers but still shitty business
2021-06-09 17:36:55,wallstreetbets,wish is like the shittiest website and company on the net. We've been through this already during the IPO. Useless stock that no one likes.
2021-06-09 19:12:45,wallstreetbets,"WISH is trash and you made a bad decision, GME is the real play"

2021-06-09 18:05:07,wallstreetbets,Not all of us care about stocks based on their shorts. $WISH has actual fundamentals and is going to the moon. It's still on discount so last chance before we launch 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-09 18:15:50,wallstreetbets,"Thank you master roshi but snag a senzu bean and calm down. Much respect for running the hedges into the ground but WISH will create winners, bag holders, moon dwellers, Mars pirates and maybe make Pluto a planet again. 🙌🏻"

2021-06-09 17:18:53,wallstreetbets,It's spicy haha this shit will be at $20 soon enough
2021-06-09 17:51:06,wallstreetbets,LOL Im not Scooby-Doo'n people big dog! I created this account because of the WISH rally-- which I was previously invested in. Loved the momentum around it because (IMO) WISH actually has legs and would be a sound investment regardless. Of course I'm trying to come up but if I can help the community and burn some shorts too that's a win-win 👊🏻
2021-06-09 17:31:44,wallstreetbets,I bought in months ago my man-- been buying the dips to get my price to where it is now. Most analysts have put out buy ratings and I believe consensus is around $20. It will get there 👊🏻
2021-06-09 18:04:06,wallstreetbets,FB had The same lawsuit after there IPO it didn't hurt the company or shares at all.

2021-06-09 17:27:01,wallstreetbets,LOL no I'm sane and I have been invested in WISH for a while now. Made an account when the rally started because this stock is valuable but was taken to the shed when it actually has legs. Peter and the WISH higher ups are locked in and regardless this stock was bound to 🚀.
2021-06-09 17:35:53,wallstreetbets,Out of all the meme stocks this is easily the most sound one to date-- get out the kitchen if you dont have the sauce 🔥🔥
2021-06-09 19:00:38,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, if we’re choosing AMC or WISH I’d certainly pick the latter. I get the GME MOASS hype but can’t see why ppl are valuing AMC anywhere close to what it is. Biggest ‘meme’ holding still GME, but I’m sprinkling in some WISH/WKHS/WEN too—all of which are better plays than AMC in my humble (cough: retarded) opinion 🙏🏽"
2021-06-09 18:03:24,wallstreetbets,Agreed keep up the good work don't let them discourage you this reminds me of when I bought FB at the IPO then it crashed to 18 bucks now there well over 200 get in now hold for year's and you will be rich.
2021-06-09 17:43:25,wallstreetbets,"Right man, To the 🚀🚀🚀😅"
2021-06-09 18:46:21,wallstreetbets,"hot garbage. Have no position. We all went through this back during the IPO. Wish is a lost cause, guy. just trying to warn guys like you who got sold by bots today."

2021-06-09 18:01:48,wallstreetbets,Exactly ceo can't vest his options unless the stock price gets to 40 I believe
2021-06-09 18:48:48,wallstreetbets,Again I bought in months ago have met the CEO and a few of the higher ups. They're extremely intelligent and fully grasp the market they serve. If anything you're dissuading people from a sound system investment and it's weird how much you care for not having any juice behind it. Leggoo

2021-06-09 17:14:00,wallstreetbets,"Awesome to see your gains on an American Industrial Company. I think small to midcap American industrials are really going to take off because of infrastructure spending and general sentiment. A few examples that I've honed in on include Foster (FSTR), Graham Corp (GHM), Park Aerospace (PKE), Gulf Island Fabrication (GIFI), ATN International (ATNI), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Consolidated Communications (CNSL), and Genie Energy (GNE)."

Something something “fundamentals” too, but what sold it for me is that it was one of the only tickers that didn’t end red today, and had similar patterns to other stocks on wsb a day or two before they took off and rocketed. Keep in mind I’m a smooth brained ape with a small account, but I think at open CLF will be very green. Who knows if it will stay that way or plummet after market open"

But if you must know I have 195 AMC shares at 12.95 average.  The money amount isn’t important.  It’s the percentage gain.  Which won’t exist with CLF LOLLL

2021-06-09 17:16:25,wallstreetbets,"I’m super new to options but if they bought calls for $9 at the current price, wouldn’t they be banking on the price to drop? Like a put? Just trying to learn"
2021-06-09 18:49:07,wallstreetbets,38% short an climbing. Break 22 by Friday and it’s dangerous times for shitidel
2021-06-09 17:06:09,wallstreetbets,So clov goes moon?
2021-06-09 17:12:34,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of people are going to buy back in soon. A lot of people made some bank this week and cashed out, which rightfully so.
But now that the stock dropped $16 today, I feel like everyone who was going to sell, already did. And I think alot of people who cashed out when it was high, are going to buy back in.
This is the first big hit the stock took in a long time, have faith it's only temporary 🙏
Edit: price"
2021-06-09 17:23:50,wallstreetbets,"I would’ve  been apart of that 5mil if I would’ve just not been greedy and sold my calls at market open.. now I’m negative, praying wallstreet tards hop on board one last time😞"
2021-06-09 17:16:41,wallstreetbets,This will likely be used as collateral for short share return requirements.

2021-06-09 17:19:27,wallstreetbets,That link brings you do a deleted post
2021-06-09 17:23:32,wallstreetbets,Not if you pay a 10 dollar premium. The play here is that CLOV won't be less than 9$ on 7/16 but will also be above 19$ at some point in the future
2021-06-09 17:10:52,wallstreetbets,God I fucking hope so lol
2021-06-09 17:20:41,wallstreetbets,I cashed out 2000% this am. But I’d have to disagree with the last point there are ALOT of bag holders. Any thing past $20 and sellers will step in to at least break even. CLOV is done for.
2021-06-09 17:31:15,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-06-09 17:19:53,wallstreetbets,"Damn auto mod, one moment."

2021-06-09 17:28:47,wallstreetbets,"Hey man congrats that's awesome. But don't forget, alot of people did that with every other meme stock, and every single one of those had multiple double digit losses. They all also had multiple rallys too."
2021-06-09 17:39:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah and at each rally there were more sellers than before. Stifling another bull run. That’s not even considering day traders that will scalp this at any sign of strength.

2021-06-09 17:16:21,wallstreetbets,"Awesome to see your gains on an American Industrial Company. I think small to midcap American industrials are really going to take off because of infrastructure spending and general sentiment. A few examples that I've honed in on include Foster (FSTR), Graham Corp (GHM), Park Aerospace (PKE), Gulf Island Fabrication (GIFI), ATN International (ATNI), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Consolidated Communications (CNSL), and Genie Energy (GNE)."

2021-06-09 17:50:42,wallstreetbets,STLD ?
2021-06-09 17:57:25,wallstreetbets,I think Market cap and or ratio on STLD are a little too high for the industry. Could be a positive play but I think the room for exponential growth is too limited.
2021-06-09 17:01:32,wallstreetbets,Right there with you man. Haven’t sold a thing!

2021-06-09 17:39:21,wallstreetbets,"You hop to all the clover posts to boast your gains, are you not satisfied with them that you need to bash other people? I keep seeing your 2000% gain, and somehow you are not happy. Almost like you’re worried it could have been 4000%. Take the profits and be happy"
2021-06-09 17:32:17,wallstreetbets,"Can I interest you in a savings bond? I get that a guy can get totally wiped the hell out, and if you just take that risk then basically you’re gambling, but compared to an options yolo or placing a large wager on the NHL playoffs when a team from Las Vegas is involved, it’s not a proper all or nothing gamble. If you have a conviction that the price you bought at could not possibly be the all time high, and you would rather risk waiting potentially years to recover and reap a few percent than sell at a loss, then in my mind it’s less like a gamble and more like not knowing whether you have made a short term investment or opened a savings account."

This guy bought shares so not so bad. He can hold a lil longer. But I can tell by the way he threw 80k at the top yesterday shows he has no risk management. He lost 15k all bc he didn’t do any TA. He would’ve saw past support at $17 and set a limit order. Sold some at $28 an ATH"

Frankly a lot of us are chasing the craze and learning as we go, and hopefully we all know how dangerous that can be. But like I said, if he’s at peace with the idea that he may have to weather a storm, and that was a conscious decision, then I respect him for not getting emotional and breaking his plan- it MAY mean that instead of taking the loss that he just takes a longer time to get his gain- hopefully."
2021-06-09 17:59:55,wallstreetbets,Much aggressive

2021-06-09 17:51:54,wallstreetbets,It definitely takes time man! If we’re being honest I started trading back in Jan with the GME craze. After being a bag holder from not selling my gains I decided I should fall back form wsb and learn. Now I’m back lmao

2021-06-09 17:07:17,wallstreetbets,I'm sorry. I don't like it when normal people like you and me get taken. Fuck those dudes!

2021-06-09 18:10:26,wallstreetbets,"Amc is going to be huge, don’t fall for the FUD"

2021-06-09 18:13:16,wallstreetbets,"What we need now is the mass exodus of all these distractions.. wish, clove, bb etc. if we apply the pressure we end this war on top apes"
2021-06-09 19:57:47,wallstreetbets,Hf are fucked !! I love this fucking stock.
2021-06-09 16:54:31,wallstreetbets,Vote no on the share dilution question
2021-06-09 19:18:54,wallstreetbets,AMC to the moon!
2021-06-09 17:09:26,wallstreetbets,"Load and hold AMC until tripple digits, as simple as that"
2021-06-09 17:27:50,wallstreetbets,Hope this doesn’t get removed OP
2021-06-09 18:32:00,wallstreetbets,Get this to the front page
2021-06-09 18:59:49,wallstreetbets,Dude.. there is some serious sweeping under the rug on amc. More than I remember for gme.
2021-06-09 18:21:41,wallstreetbets,Where is u/deepfuckingvalue when we need him the most 😭
2021-06-09 18:26:36,wallstreetbets,Bought 33 more shares today. AMC Apes together strong!
2021-06-09 17:09:09,wallstreetbets,I had shares from way back when $20 was still a dream and totally forgot I had a limit order to unload when it hit that.  Saw the $50 mark with excitement before realizing it auto-sold well before.  Learned my lesson for next time.
2021-06-09 17:49:51,wallstreetbets,"I hold AMC, but I was late to the party, and I only hold a tiny chunk- to enough to stress about. Needed to join the ape team... ape solidarity and all, ya know? (They don’t call them meme stocks for nothin’).
I’m more focused on things like CLOV, WEN for short term.    The long term stuff I like is TSLA, VTI, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, TXT, SHOP, TGT,...  boring stuff like that that don’t do the whole hockey-stick thing like we might see for CLOV or WEN... and like a lot of you apes did with GameStop and AMC."
2021-06-09 16:57:09,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-09 17:26:54,wallstreetbets,😧😳
2021-06-09 17:52:21,wallstreetbets,"I bought a good bit less than you of AMC, but for a higher price. I’m jelly of your holdings. But, I hope you got some eggs in another basket."
2021-06-09 17:08:12,wallstreetbets,"I’m voting yes. That’s for next year at the earliest, I want the company to survive, they might need that, I’d rather win in the long run after saving amc, otherwise I would have cashed out already"
2021-06-09 18:26:12,wallstreetbets,"The AMC party hasn't even begun, you certainly aren't late."
2021-06-09 17:09:12,wallstreetbets,"They can survive, voting no just means they offer something more beneficial to us as investors and we have an option to choose that or not"
2021-06-09 18:35:04,wallstreetbets,Maybe you are right.  I guess I could put a little more in- but I’m joining in a little deeper on the CLOV bandwagon hopefully down at the business end of the hokey stick.
2021-06-09 17:11:26,wallstreetbets,But he already gave us a large popcorn
2021-06-09 17:12:02,wallstreetbets,The popcorn was to butter us up for a yes in share dilution
2021-06-09 17:45:46,wallstreetbets,Is that a buttered popcorn joke??  I hope so 🤣
2021-06-09 17:02:44,wallstreetbets,"Bought calls yesterday saw it go up 63% this morning, but didn’t sell instead bought some shares then started taking losses. at what seemed like the lowest point mid day I decide to buy some more calls. Really beginning to question if this was a good idea, but I mean it’s higher than it was last week and 06/18 is a week away. Starting to sweat but still holding dont fucking let me down"
2021-06-09 17:14:58,wallstreetbets,CLOV has leadership from previous top medical corporations in the tri state area and is Medicare credentialed. The idea is phenomenal. Hold on tight.
2021-06-09 17:18:35,wallstreetbets,"Upvotes, good work!

**CLOV**

The information that I've posted here a few times regarding number of short shares returned today on CLOV, and the violation of the SSR can be found here. Please take a look at it, up it so that others can see it before it is drowned in the rest of the noise. Thank you!

2021-06-09 17:11:09,wallstreetbets,I wish I bought calls I got F****ng SHARES
2021-06-09 17:11:36,wallstreetbets,Clover is a tech enabled health insurance company. They don't provide health care at all
2021-06-09 16:57:11,wallstreetbets,Tldr; I’m upset I lost money on a gamble
2021-06-09 16:53:55,wallstreetbets,Your bags aren’t caused by bots but by profit takers like me :)
2021-06-09 16:59:28,wallstreetbets,"I mean CLOV may look good compared to AMC but there’s a legit reason it was shorted to shit. Calling it a good stock is a stretch.

Company misled investors twice already by not disclosing SEC inquiry and lying about contracted numbers. Latest quarterly numbers were also terrible with claims paid higher than premiums received and as a result operating cash flow declined by 5x."
2021-06-09 16:56:02,wallstreetbets,The pin has been pulled on AMC.
2021-06-09 17:40:05,wallstreetbets,"We will stay on earth until all the apes stop chasing every banana and finish what we started on gme and AMC. No reason amc fell like this but clov,bb,and aemd all the other shinny tickers they throw at us. I'm in AMC at 9.45 so ya keep creating bag holders and not winners."
2021-06-09 17:27:39,wallstreetbets,It's a doctors office and a p&d
2021-06-09 17:29:39,wallstreetbets,10 CLOV 12/17 $15C CMON MAINE I NEED THESE IN THE MONEY AGAIN
2021-06-09 17:05:47,wallstreetbets,I’m with ya. Reminds me of the down day on GME during the big run up. Down 20% in a day but still up 70% in three days. It can’t go straight up. If shorts really did only add today I like where were at.
2021-06-09 19:58:21,wallstreetbets,"Buying weeklies on a meme stock with insane IV after a 80%+ gain was a bad idea. I see CLOV going past $25, but it could be on June 18th or the week after. Hard to say really, margin call can be this Friday or next week. Buying leaps for a 2-5X gain is safer."
2021-06-09 16:59:52,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣
2021-06-09 17:00:43,wallstreetbets,"Lost money today* been in since Friday so I’m up overall. What I’m trying to say is if I make a bad decision and get a trade wrong, fine, that happens, but we can help each other by not falling for FUD"
2021-06-09 17:26:33,wallstreetbets,"Congrats? I’ve been in this since Friday so I’ve profited also, by all means make your money. Not sure why you’re taking pleasure in other peoples misfortune - this is the attitude that is weakening WSB"
2021-06-09 16:57:20,wallstreetbets,"Hol' up,.. we can take profits?"
2021-06-09 17:19:21,wallstreetbets,Profit taking doesn't explain 367 million in volume and blatant violation of the SSR.
2021-06-09 17:09:52,wallstreetbets,"It was already determined the SEC inquiry was routine and not something had to be disclosed. It’s in a growth stage, not concerned with cash flow"
2021-06-09 17:07:50,wallstreetbets,Next stop....moon
2021-06-09 17:47:33,wallstreetbets,"Dudes been going on all the clover posts bragging about his gains. It really feels like he’s uncertain about his huge gains and that it might not be the top dog of gains in the end of it all, so he prances around making everyone else feel bad to support his bias"
2021-06-09 17:44:46,wallstreetbets,"No the attitude ruining it is ppl thinking they can all win. You spreading this info helps no one. Not everyone can profit. There must be bag holders. Your inadvertently creating more, probably to save your own bags. Stop acting like you’re on the side of morality. This is the market and has no use for your emotions."
2021-06-09 17:12:08,wallstreetbets,It's called the 'sell' button (and options only if you understand them). You then get extra money that appears in your account on green side. I know... Money... Green... Take your time.
2021-06-09 17:23:17,wallstreetbets,"Selling counts as volume, also there is no blatant  violation. You’re just speculating."
2021-06-09 17:15:11,wallstreetbets,"You’re not concerned with an insurance company paying more in claims than it receives in premiums?

I have no position in the company whatsoever and people can invest their money however they want, but IMO it’s one thing to gamble looking for a short squeeze and another to actually know what it is you’re investing in"
2021-06-09 17:10:48,wallstreetbets,🤦
2021-06-09 18:42:33,wallstreetbets,"I’m not saying everyone can or will make money. It’s wallstreetBETS. What do you think made GME and AMC so powerful? Yea it was a good set up, but emotion. Apes together strong. The only way this works if our emotions make us irrational. Time will tell"
2021-06-09 17:23:43,wallstreetbets,LMAO
2021-06-09 17:25:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm not speculating, you could watch it happen in the L2 data. It was plainly obvious that selling was being done into the bid side of the spread."
2021-06-09 17:41:53,wallstreetbets,"I know many don’t like Motley Fool, but as they say “During the first quarter of 2021, the company earned approximately $1,005 per member per month in Medicare rebates, which amounts to $12,060 annualized. That is well within the national average of $9,240 to $22,248 in reimbursements for each Medicare beneficiary between the age of 65 and 95-plus. The report alleges that Clover pays doctors twice the normal Medicare reimbursement amount ($100) as one of its main tenets for the bearish view on the stock. However, it's difficult to see if this has much of an overall impact on Clover Health's practices as its plans are not that far off (if not lower) than the reimbursement rates of the average Medicare Advantage plan.   

It is also important to note that Medical Advantage organizations are legally required to pay 85% of premiums on members' health benefits and quality improvement. Not surprisingly, industry peers typically pay a number just around the minimum requirement to maximize profits. However, Clover Health spends up to 95.4% of its premiums on patients' medical expenses. Naturally, patients are more inclined to switch to plans that offer better value for their money.”

So yes, I do like the prospects of a company that  could disrupt our garbage ass health care system, is trying to attract patients by doing things that will help them attract patients, especially when it could work accounting wise"
2021-06-09 17:26:09,wallstreetbets,Like I said. Speculation. Just bc your have a small piece of info doesn’t mean you know what’s “blatantly”  happening. You have a small piece of a much bigger puzzle.
2021-06-09 17:28:28,wallstreetbets,"You can tell me you think I'm speculating all you want, but it was plainly obvious. You could watch the exact definition of a short sale restriction violation happen in real time on the level 2 Data right in front of you. If you weren't watching that, I'm not sure how you could even comment on what I did or didn't see, and if you were watching it and didn't see it that also doesn't mean it didn't happen just that you weren't paying attention. Lol"
2021-06-09 17:42:00,wallstreetbets,…..ok. I made money otw up on my calls and now I’m up 100% on my puts. I’ll stick to my line of thinking.
2021-06-09 17:46:22,wallstreetbets,"I don't see how that's at all relevant to the conversation that we were having. Either way, congratulations I guess."
2021-06-09 17:44:41,wallstreetbets,This if you like money.
2021-06-09 17:53:22,wallstreetbets,They don’t wanna hear it. Lol they assume I’m a bot. Really just a GME back holder from January that took time to learn the markets so I don’t repeat past mistakes.

2021-06-09 18:40:50,wallstreetbets,Wish I was in at amc like that but at upper 40 and 50 it makes no sense for me to join in bc I could buy many shares but very happy for you we can trade places
2021-06-09 18:41:06,wallstreetbets,Couldnt
2021-06-09 17:10:15,wallstreetbets,i will stay a retard with Dimond hands

2021-06-09 17:17:16,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands is another word for bag holder

2021-06-09 18:48:56,wallstreetbets,Okay fine don’t let me down lol I can buy about 40 shares tomorrow waiting on my other crypto funds to be transferred but I will buy and hold with yall
2021-06-09 17:38:53,wallstreetbets,Better have a bag then nothing I say
2021-06-09 17:09:02,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Yeah. I suppose that’s why I kept the two contracts. That way if something crazy happens and it balloons to $50+ I don’t feel shitty about selling all of them. The $8k definitely takes a lot of weight off my shoulders. I was down $2500 all time. Not anymore!
2021-06-09 17:46:08,wallstreetbets,Ngl this gave me a good laugh 🤣 I love yall.
2021-06-09 17:15:56,wallstreetbets,"Same! My all time was down before CLOV. I felt slightly bad thinking it could run more but that was emotions talking lol my pragmatic side said 

“buy puts 😈”"

2021-06-09 16:57:55,wallstreetbets,I was sure she was going to be taken out the next day by the big hedges.

2021-06-09 16:52:00,wallstreetbets,I like both. That CLNE is my new beautiful though. Got in it today.  More tomorrow.
2021-06-09 17:12:59,wallstreetbets,Need to see UWMC break the $10.50 resistance then it’ll fly
2021-06-09 17:21:34,wallstreetbets,CLNE is up in AH and may open around 14-15 tomorrow. Worth it not just in the near term. Recognia Technical Analysis deems both short-term sentiment (2-6 weeks) and long-term sentiment (9 months to 2 years) as strong. CLNE is a solid investment either way.
2021-06-09 16:51:49,wallstreetbets,"It’s absolutely the way.  Not just for us apes, but the outside world and universe are coming on board too- massive upside

2021-06-09 17:15:06,wallstreetbets,I crawled out of bed at the crack of noon to see my sell order for some of my 12c calls printed on the morning spike.  I have some $CLF calls I will sell in the next 2 days and roll into more $UWMC calls for July.

2021-06-09 17:06:13,wallstreetbets,"Right, if this trend continues  I may sell shares after hours and buy back in on the day dip. I've gone from 500 up to 26000 the last week. It's crazy."
2021-06-09 17:48:21,wallstreetbets,"So I don’t get how this works, how long do I hold? Dropped a measly $100 into it this am"
2021-06-09 17:52:42,wallstreetbets,Killing it
2021-06-09 18:08:14,wallstreetbets,"Eli5 please, where do people find information on these stocks before they go full ape? Is it just meme season or are these actual good buys and there's tons of research behind its recent price action?"
2021-06-09 16:55:10,wallstreetbets,"I really just don’t like the gap up from the 8th to the 9th, in my experience, all memes aside, all gaps get filled eventually. Very, very tempted to ignore this warning though."
2021-06-09 19:28:55,wallstreetbets,Fk Yesterday I had 43 Contracts and I fucking sold it for 0.02. FML
2021-06-09 16:59:57,wallstreetbets,"I hope so, I have June $9 calls that didn’t make it into this screenshot because I’m on mobile"
2021-06-09 17:16:20,wallstreetbets,I sure hope so. I have been holding for a while.
2021-06-09 17:01:30,wallstreetbets,CLNE is the only one that’s powering through and is up AH. All the other meme stocks are down
2021-06-09 19:09:01,wallstreetbets,I think CLNE and CLF are worth holding after all this. I’ll take profits on on most of my shares and maybe keep 500 or so to hold
2021-06-09 17:04:14,wallstreetbets,"Yup, only meme stock that is up AF. But can’t do anything about calls AF anyways"
2021-06-09 18:07:20,wallstreetbets,"I was tempted to sell on the morning spike but I was worried it would take off like CLOV did the other day so I just held for a bit. Sold a handful of calls to double my initial cost so now it’s just house money. First time doing that, I usually take all my profits quick and get out."
2021-06-09 19:35:01,wallstreetbets,"Clf has more post, but CLNE seems easier to move"
2021-06-09 17:09:03,wallstreetbets,Make sure you don’t price them too low. Volume is low and FOMO is high AH so you can get away with selling for ridiculous amounts sometimes. I sold some shares at $15.20 this morning and then bought back after open.
2021-06-09 18:56:47,wallstreetbets,"However long you feel comfortable if you’re happy with the gains now, sell it"
2021-06-09 18:49:48,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t full ape, you’re looking at less than a 4k gamble here. I’ve just been following WSB and jumping on what’s trending. I had CLOV and WISH  earlier this week but got out yesterday"
2021-06-09 19:45:03,wallstreetbets,What strike? I didn’t see any contracts that cheap
2021-06-09 17:18:35,wallstreetbets,"Don’t wanna jynx but we didn’t take a hit aH like ever other stock. Tis be a good sign, we print tomorrow!"
2021-06-09 17:31:17,wallstreetbets,CLNE is my best performer right now. Granted I just bought it a few hours ago but very happy to say the least.
2021-06-09 19:33:54,wallstreetbets,Yup I noticed this too !
2021-06-09 18:04:43,wallstreetbets,"Well, not to brag, but UMWC is up 1.20% ;)"
2021-06-09 17:09:33,wallstreetbets,Nice.
2021-06-09 17:09:51,wallstreetbets,At one point it was over 16 I think.
2021-06-09 19:51:14,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I can wait another day I suppose"
2021-06-09 18:52:16,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the response, when I said full ape I just mean the stock goes up in spectacular fashion often accompanied by diamond handed apes but not dependent on such but thanks for the tip, trends are your friends I suppose."
2021-06-09 18:04:33,wallstreetbets,"UWMC and CLNE are both still green, I take it as a good sign"
2021-06-09 18:03:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, right after I sold and I thought I just sold 20% of my shares before 🚀"
2021-06-09 18:59:47,wallstreetbets,I’m far from doing a diamond handed yolo. I play it safe by WSB standards. The initial bet was only about 3% of my portfolio. I already sold enough to recover my initial bet + a 100% gain and now letting the house money ride. Makes it easier to hold through the dips.
2021-06-09 16:50:08,wallstreetbets,Post the numbers fortune teller ape. I’ll read them
2021-06-09 17:38:42,wallstreetbets,Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?

2021-06-09 18:03:09,wallstreetbets,Think it dips a bit from here? Ran hard today. Well by VIAC  standards.
2021-06-09 18:57:49,wallstreetbets,No dip!  Look at the company
2021-06-09 17:07:17,wallstreetbets,I dig it.

2021-06-09 19:12:16,wallstreetbets,Am I the only one looking through the comments and noticing how all of the accounts creating comments were made within ~30 days of each other?
2021-06-09 19:30:28,wallstreetbets,20 + SOON
2021-06-09 17:18:54,wallstreetbets,"I sold 2 puts on WISH @ $15. & $12.50, jokes on them if they print.  My avg cost will be low $8.00 from the premium adjustment.  W/E if they print, I’ll just sell calls later."
2021-06-09 16:49:48,wallstreetbets,"Is there a way to show why the volume, with so much going on if it isn’t all sell would drive the price the way it has?"
2021-06-09 19:13:21,wallstreetbets,"Fellow ape tard here, just getting into WISH, loaded up on 1000 shares after hours. Keep holding fellow fuck tards."
2021-06-09 17:41:10,wallstreetbets,"We will stay on earth until all the apes stop chasing every banana and finish what we started on gme and AMC. No reason amc fell like this but clov,bb,and aemd all the other shinny tickers they throw at us. I'm in AMC at 9.45 so ya keep creating bag holders and not winners."
2021-06-09 16:47:41,wallstreetbets,It’s not looking to good :/

2021-06-09 16:54:11,wallstreetbets,"you’re welcome fellow internet person. Keep holding. Chance it may drop more before an increase , which i say buy more if possible. Solid stock outside of the meme squeeze capabilities"
2021-06-09 17:57:49,wallstreetbets,"Up in the after hours, seems like the club is getting bigger 😂"

2021-06-09 16:45:19,wallstreetbets,I bought in at the peak. Nothing but pure love for the stock market considering this is my third day investing
2021-06-09 16:52:56,wallstreetbets,I didn't hear no bell. I'm buying more tomorrow.

2021-06-09 16:50:34,wallstreetbets,I pumped and dumbed the shit out of this to buy more AMC and GME
2021-06-09 17:14:30,wallstreetbets,I bought $11 Puts once I saw this thing peak and start to crash.  My fear is they will be realized.
2021-06-09 17:30:56,wallstreetbets,"Ouch, I definitely don't feel bad about my decisions now."
2021-06-09 18:05:54,wallstreetbets,So you're saying buying in after a stock goes up 80% and then 100% two days in a row is....... not a good strategy?
2021-06-09 16:49:56,wallstreetbets,CLOV was a shitadel trap. GME and AMC are the only sure things.
2021-06-09 17:45:12,wallstreetbets,CLOV it up your arse 🤡🤡🤡
2021-06-09 16:50:47,wallstreetbets,Put them in $well
2021-06-09 17:46:59,wallstreetbets,Same. It happens can never tell how low or high it will stop. 🤦‍♂️
2021-06-09 17:07:25,wallstreetbets,"If you see a rally that’s growing, just let it be. You need to catch these things at the bottom/on a red day"
2021-06-09 16:48:05,wallstreetbets,Yeah never do that again. Lol look at key support and resistance. NEVER buy in at the top.
2021-06-09 16:48:20,wallstreetbets,I did this am after I cashed out my calls for 2000% 😭
2021-06-09 16:59:33,wallstreetbets,Wise.
2021-06-09 17:48:35,wallstreetbets,lol you from Fresno?
2021-06-09 17:56:53,wallstreetbets,"Saw Clov up at 40% at open and said nope I’m skipping that, it ended the day up 80%. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn’t."
2021-06-09 17:09:48,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Il keep that in mind.
2021-06-09 16:50:05,wallstreetbets,Where do you find that?
2021-06-09 17:05:00,wallstreetbets,I thought I was missing out so I panic bought. I don't understand anything about key supports or resistance. I don't know the first thing about investing I just buy when ever it seems like it's going up. Turns out that was as high as it went
2021-06-09 17:50:55,wallstreetbets,From Apetown
2021-06-09 17:17:57,wallstreetbets,"Generally speaking. And careful with FOMO and with these meme stocks, the retard meme here is definitely funny, but there’s some autists here with hysterical lines of credit, daddy’s money, editing of page source ability, or pure brain damage who make plays here. You really don’t want to be them. Don’t beat yourself up but don’t be truly retarded either. Unless you want to trade your financial and mental stability for upvotes. I think some do lol

Edit: to add, investing is not a team sport."
2021-06-09 16:53:34,wallstreetbets,"Not in Robinhood. You gotta use charting software. Use webull. You can setup a free account, and still use Robinhood to trade (I wouldn’t)."
2021-06-09 16:54:43,wallstreetbets,I agree ! We bull is good for trading. I use RH to gamble options. TradingView to monitor tickers.

2021-06-09 17:15:34,wallstreetbets,Price target for this week ?
2021-06-09 16:41:20,wallstreetbets,$TR will be the next $GME.  Massive short squeeze about to happen 🚀🚀
2021-06-09 16:47:22,wallstreetbets,"The current market cap is $21B.

The highest market cap this company ever had pre-2021 was $10B back in 2007. The highest it’s been in the past decade was $6.5B in 2013.

The current market cap is $21B.

If you thought an ER beat would guarantee the stock moving up, I don’t really know what to tell you.

ER’s are fundamentals, I can assure you that nobody who owns GME wants it to start trading on fundamentals."
2021-06-09 19:17:56,wallstreetbets,The companies valuation is no longer tied to reality.
2021-06-09 16:52:26,wallstreetbets,You know that was in the estimates and they crushed it right?
2021-06-09 16:47:25,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-09 17:30:38,wallstreetbets,When you're this far from trading on fundamentals price targets are pretty meaningless.

2021-06-09 17:13:14,wallstreetbets,"Other way. Max loss is $1,480."
2021-06-09 17:21:20,wallstreetbets,"That’s a bear call spread, no? A bear call spread would be betting on it to go down. But you SOLD the bear call spread, meaning you bet on the opposite. The opposite of down would be up. 

Or am I not reading the trade correctly?"
2021-06-09 17:30:16,wallstreetbets,It's a bear call spread because they sold it. He wants the stock below 330.
2021-06-09 17:30:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Bear call spread. 

I'm betting on it not going up. So down or sideways would be fine."
2021-06-09 17:35:13,wallstreetbets,"Ah word. My brokerage displays it differently! Thanks for clarification! I am up $240 on my bear call spread, and looking like I could end up max profit tomorrow! It isn’t as wide as yours 😆"

2021-06-09 16:55:12,wallstreetbets,"The hedge funds didn't cover is the concensus.  Positive news for GME means the stock price stays higher than it really should be which is bad for short positions. If it stays bad long enough or continues to go up and they get margin called then an actual once in a lifetime style short squeeze happens. 

If the company does bad or stagnated the price drops down to a place where the hedge funds can cover and not go bankrupt.

This why holding is so important to the squeeze."

HF and MM needed liquidity hence they named shorted this and other stocks to raise temporary capital, now that they don’t need it for covering GME, it flows back into CLOV and others, both shares n calls.  LFG!! 🚀"
2021-06-09 16:46:05,wallstreetbets,Remember GME tanked then it went BOOm again.  Dont be that guy.
2021-06-09 16:34:43,wallstreetbets,"I’m a “ride or die” CLOV bitch, but you lost me at “I have thought of two scenarios.”"
2021-06-09 17:09:29,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer: I trade vol, not financial advice.

Respectfully, I disagree - I'll add a bit of market mechanics from my understanding.

&#x200B;

A number of hedge funds were probably short $CLOV. There is precedence for funds to short a basket of companies as part of a larger strategy. I think in this case it would have been ""short Chamath companies"" but they do not coordinate in the way that is suggested. There are too many sharks in the water. Fast money (bots) are on both sides of the trade. If a rival fund sees that retail is collectively buying up call options, they often swoop in and give the ticker a push to the upside.

&#x200B;

Why would they do this? A large fraction of the trades that people like you and me execute are against dealers/market makers like Citadel. Market makers care more about the bid/ask spread and changes in volatility than the direction. In order to achieve this delta neutrality, they hedge on the sale of the option and as the underlying moves.

&#x200B;

Those call options that WSB loves so much act as accelerant. There have been tons of previous posts around here on the greeks so I won't go too into detail. In short, the teeny tiny calls that everyone here buys have massive gamma changes as the price moves up.

&#x200B;

Options do play a role in a stock's ability to move up in value quickly. I haven't looked at CLOV specifically, but if call strikes were in fact limited to $22 at the highest before today, a large amount of the OI would have been well ITM. Options way ITM have much less of a hedging effect. Also, retail mostly doesn't exercise them. Everyone on this sub has the attention span of a goldfish (no disrespect, I am the same). As a result, those calls get dumped as people move on to other plays. If the sentiment changes enough, people stop buying OTM calls at the new listed strikes and the price crashes. The dealers then dump their hedges because they aren't necessary anymore."

2021-06-09 16:51:55,wallstreetbets,Same sold my 11$ calls when it was at 23$.  Might buy back in if it goes down a little lower to check out if the 6/18 and 6/25 catalysts pan put.
2021-06-09 18:59:24,wallstreetbets,Let me know
2021-06-09 16:38:59,wallstreetbets,Fr. How much are you down?
2021-06-09 16:40:59,wallstreetbets,"Someone was saying clov would be $4. 

Dont know waht happened to the dude. Hopefully he didnt short it"

2021-06-09 17:49:21,wallstreetbets,Holding.
2021-06-09 16:44:15,wallstreetbets,"Made a killing (given that I’m not investing crazy money) but then literally lost every cent today. I made a post about it but it’s time to get some strategy and boundaries together because without that I feel like it’s just a gambling addiction which is not what I need lol. So far I’ve kept it within reasonable limits and haven’t lost what I can’t replace but I gotta educate myself more if I’m going to keep doing this.

Lol while I wrote this I get the notification “GME IS DOWN!”"
2021-06-09 17:01:25,wallstreetbets,"This is helpful honestly. I do tend run on losing trades fast, I’m very new and am sitting writing in a notebook trying to get some kind of strategy going. Can I verify that you’re A) holding more than you started with and if so B) do you have advice on what kind of fluctuation to tolerate and at what point one should just get the fuck out? Side note, I’m not working with money that I need to survive but don’t want to have that be a reason to set it ablaze."
2021-06-09 16:37:18,wallstreetbets,"Bc the actual earnings call isn’t until 5pm ET, where they will announce more than just EPS and revenue….  Watch for after then."

2021-06-09 19:26:14,wallstreetbets,Just gotta hold . Works all the time.
2021-06-09 16:44:25,wallstreetbets,Right!? I woke up the other morning cause my GME alarm set for $340 went off and then I saw CLOV was up and said fuck it. Still holding GME!
2021-06-09 16:54:37,wallstreetbets,I'm to unknowledgable and scared to do calls lol
2021-06-09 16:41:56,wallstreetbets,Idk about $4. $15 at best. I’m confused how you saw the peak this am but held
2021-06-09 17:01:30,wallstreetbets,Coming from someone who made a killing and lost it all. Be careful you’ll constantly search for that high again. Nothing compares to seeing 3-4 digit percentile returns. But more often than not your see a - 100 percent on your Friday’s when gambling
2021-06-09 17:03:29,wallstreetbets,I am in no way giving anybody any financial advice because I don’t want it to become where I said to buy or sell based on what I think and I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night knowing that if I told you to hold or sell I would lose you money or cost you money.. I’ve only been trading and buying stock for 15 months..
2021-06-09 16:41:40,wallstreetbets,What earnings do they make? They still losing money...
2021-06-09 18:32:08,wallstreetbets,Ayo 🙌🙌
2021-06-09 16:53:13,wallstreetbets,I mean I made about half of what I put it but idc. At least I'm not stressing about the loss right now
2021-06-09 17:05:01,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate it. Do you have guidance on how much loss to tolerate? And then obviously you don’t pack it up and go home forever (unless you do) but then I guess you should take that money and diversify again. 

Funny enough I sold on a big profit this morning and when it crashed I was like “buy the dip I’m a genius” lol. I even, I shit you not, bought more at closing. I just wrote everything out and all things considered I’m in the hole $75 from my trading. Not bad in terms of bad but bad in terms of...good. I’ve never seen triple digit returns and would be way out of there. When I got the big return on CLOV I had diversified that day and when clov was taking off, was able to transfer the money from one meme stonk to the performing one. Today the mistake was being like “worked once should work again then I’ll be fucking golden”.

Turns out the thing that worked was waiting to see what worked, not any specific move. I’m currently trying to sort out how much loss to tolerate. I’ve been selling at like 5-10% but with the stuff being so volatile it’s hard to know where it’s headed and I can’t always be staring at the market even though it’s tempting to."
2021-06-09 17:27:50,wallstreetbets,Financial advice taken! I kid but expect to take this stuff as just one additional perspective and experience but not a prescription to riches.
2021-06-09 17:16:04,wallstreetbets,"If your buying and selling stock than honestly your playing it safe and recommend this way. Options is when I got in trouble. When is triple my net worth over night. And than want to do it again. 

Advice, I’d say if it’s good enough to screenshot sell. That’s something I wish I paid more attention to lol. 

Once your portfolio is up a considerable amount I would pull out at least your initial investment. ( you get a lot more careless when’s it’s the “ houses “ money. 

Like I said stick to swing trading stocks. I made great money from that. I never made those screen shot worthy amounts but it was an honest living. 

On loss tolerance id say that depends on you and your situation. I’m fortunate to own a successful irrigation company. My wife makes decent money and out house in 6 figures in the green. So I’m a little more careless about my “ investments” but if I did this full time I’d be alot more carful. A lot good traders will pull out 10-15 percent down and put it into something they think they can make it back. 

Hope any of this helps. As I am a fucking tard myself."
2021-06-09 17:24:22,wallstreetbets,"This is definitely helpful and I appreciate it. I’m young-ish (27) work, am about to finish my masters, and charge a solid hourly rate. If everything collapsed my family would help and I don’t have kids so if there was a position to take on risk I’m kind of in it. 

Is swing trading just trading once a day? I actually started the transfer of my savings money into my RH account so that I could meet the day trading requirement while being super diligent to not spend more than I’m comfortable with ($1000-2000). Is that a horrendous idea lol? It feels like I have to be able to set up unlimited stop losses when things go up fucking 20% and then crash to -10% in less than an hour. 

I had the wisdom to sell, but when it crashed I bought again (oops)."
2021-06-09 18:01:28,wallstreetbets,"Swing is how you avoid pdt rules. Just means you buy today sell tomorrow. Typically stick with some burning stock and can make 1-10 percent a day, just depending on the market and without much risk. As most morning stocks if they have a bad day you can decide if you want to hold for a few more days to make your money back. When I was doing stock only and no options I literally never lost money. Like maybe once of a Chinese coffee company that may not be named. But that was the only time. Than I got big balls and went for options. 

I’d highly suggest swing trading and learn Ning how read charts. Even if it’s as simple as understanding supports and resistances. 

Also another piece of advice is eliminating the words “ what if “ because that shit will
Keep you up at night. If you sell for a 5 percent profit and the next day you could have made 20 percent who gives a fuck you could have also lost 20 percent. We’re all just guessing. While they maybe educational guesses and some are better at calculating nothing stopping this shut from tanking tomorrow or soaring to the moon. 

Also Robinhood is a pretty dope app for beginners ( insert the hate ) but I’d go with td Ameritrade if I was gonna do a 25k account or Webull but they are Chinese soooo idk how feel about them but that’s where I’d day trade stock because of there premarket and aftermarket is great and there charts are the best"
2021-06-09 18:03:08,wallstreetbets,Sorry for the shit typing iPhone hates my fat fingers.
2021-06-09 18:01:53,wallstreetbets,Boring*
2021-06-09 18:26:18,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, I tried out some different platforms but eventually found myself back on robinhood honestly in part for their consistently live updating graphs. I got kind of screwed on both fidelity and Ameritrade by that. Probably a lack of experience on my part but Jesus lol.

I’ll read on the resistances and support and consider branching out on brokers at some point in the near future. I would like to be able to trade with a trailing stop loss for profits and having a cutoff sell point.

Is there a loss point that you found worked for you when swing trading? Aka if something tanks 25%, should I really hold onto it another day?"
2021-06-09 16:29:06,wallstreetbets,It could have been worse. It could have been CLOV.

2021-06-09 16:29:56,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-06-09 19:02:01,wallstreetbets,"Market makers will buy shares before the options expire as the price of the underlying gets closer to the strike price of the option. The number of shares they buy is usually close to the delta of all options added together. 

For example, if fake stock $X was selling for $10/share, and there was only one strike price available for call options at $10, and the delta of that option was 0.50, then market makers would be sure they held 50 shares of $X for every option they sold. If the price of the underlying stock then increased to $20, the delta for those options would increase to something like 0.90 (because the probability of the option expiring in the money is very high), so the market makers would want to have at least 90 shares for each option they sell. So market makers buy additional shares to limit their risk.

When the underlying price moves that much that fast, the gamma (a second order derivative of delta) of the option also increases. This represents how fast delta will change when the underlying stock price changes. When it's high, option prices swing more violently when the underlying stock price changes.

Hence - a gamma squeeze.

All of this is happening before the expiry."
2021-06-09 17:04:47,wallstreetbets,Start bit before before $13 and then continue after as more and more strikes go ITM
2021-06-09 16:52:30,wallstreetbets,We just getting started !
2021-06-09 16:53:36,wallstreetbets,If it continues to climb you could still jump in. Of course I tend to do that & everything drops like a idk I can’t think of anything lol

2021-06-09 16:40:05,wallstreetbets,"I’d like to say you’re going to treble your money, but the shorts have this one buttoned down.  Hope I’m wrong and it goes back to 22.65 at least."
2021-06-09 17:11:27,wallstreetbets,"wow, that is some next level autism.  I like it."
2021-06-09 16:35:15,wallstreetbets,UWMC was the one you should have picked. It’s ready to double.

2021-06-09 16:42:14,wallstreetbets,"It can’t break 22.70. Soon as it goes near there a wall pops up, but some whale just put in 1.2 mil on $23 calls. So I figure if I lose, at least I got company"
2021-06-09 16:42:59,wallstreetbets,I just like this ticker better. It makes sense to goto the moon.  Keeping it 🦍
2021-06-09 16:42:06,wallstreetbets,Yea I agree on this.
2021-06-09 16:46:21,wallstreetbets,What expiration date? That right there is probably another lid on the price. No way the writer wants that option in the money.

2021-06-09 16:29:07,wallstreetbets,Because they also own a bunch of other crap. And Dana can go suck on an egg.
2021-06-09 16:26:21,wallstreetbets,Two guys dry humping for 3 minutes at a time and with no regionalism to the fighters makes it lack luster. UFC peaked with Christian Audiger and monarchy t-shirts.
2021-06-09 16:30:25,wallstreetbets,I don’t give a crap about Dana.  I’m not letting that tool deter me from hoping on this sleeper
2021-06-09 16:28:27,wallstreetbets,"Its only been making record high revenue the last 10 years..... 

You should probably watch more of it.  Dry humping is a thing of the past that some people think still happens."
2021-06-09 16:25:48,wallstreetbets,Your wife is a weekly squeeze
2021-06-09 16:40:26,wallstreetbets,I support this message. GE MOON I SEE TICKER I PRESS BUY
2021-06-09 16:23:32,wallstreetbets,I think the so called news about inflation is going to make all boomer stocks tank tomorrow
2021-06-09 16:45:29,wallstreetbets,"Here’s a little story about your darling company. I do things for them, that’s about as specific as I’m really willing to be. So, we had a thing to do for them 2 days ago, was all set and ready to complete the task. The day before, GE, hereby known as the company sent me an email saying not to do the thing until the 29th, cool no problem we’ll get set up to do the thing on the 29th instead.

So, yesterday, the day after the email, I got a phone call from someone definitely not named Tony who works for the company. He sounded nervous from the first words, which were heyyy uhhmm remember the thing you were doing for us that is part of our million dollar project? Well it’s 10:51, supposed to be done by 11am and just checking on where you are...

I then froze for a second, pulled up the email, and read it to the sender of the email. It was a “typo”, he wrote in the email the 29th, but actually meant the 8th(yesterday).

Needless to say all of my resources were already allocated elsewhere, and he was SOL.

This type of thing is absurdly common for the company, and it’s exactly why I will never invest a nickel in them, despite me strongly believing the CEO is the right man and is making the right moves.

This is not financial advice, and should be considered a work of fiction or entertainment."
2021-06-09 16:47:03,wallstreetbets,Ge was a great asset to buy for me way down in the 8.53

2021-06-09 16:45:20,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for support, but don’t just blindly buy the ticker. That’s never smart."

2021-06-09 16:50:01,wallstreetbets,Nice. Sounds like literally every company in the world. I used to work for the John Hopkins AP lab and that was a regular. Luckily we were R&D with blank checks so it was ok. And there are no share holders.
2021-06-09 17:05:46,wallstreetbets,"If there is one thing I learned, is the bigger the company,  the bigger the clusterfuck is with then. At a small company, one or two people would probably be involved with whatever project. With them? That project probably went through 20 different hands atleast before it got to you"
2021-06-09 17:15:42,wallstreetbets,Big oof.
2021-06-09 16:51:00,wallstreetbets,That’s pretty much cash value right now.
2021-06-09 16:30:02,wallstreetbets,Maybe you thinked wrong
2021-06-09 16:32:02,wallstreetbets,Just a squeeze on the weekly calls sorry. Bad title.

2021-06-09 17:57:41,wallstreetbets,"Many years ago, I made the same mistake.  But, to make matters worse, I did it on my parents account which I was managing/helping with at the time.  My father wanted to buy Ford. ... you know.. good big American company and all.   Yup... made the dumb mistake of buying ticker symbol FORD - not the American automobile manufacture. My father held that stock (Forward Industries, FORD) for a decade or more until just recently.  So, you aren’t the only one."

2021-06-09 17:30:46,wallstreetbets,Ford’s last ATH was 1999. You could have bought in middle school and still lost money.

2021-06-09 16:47:11,wallstreetbets,Congrats on the gains. Just can’t get behind the company that built my dad’s truck that always seemed to break down right in front my school 😂😂😂😂
2021-06-09 16:42:09,wallstreetbets,"I like what the company is doing, and I like their new lightning pickup.
I don’t like the almost 4 Billion share float."

2021-06-09 16:21:39,wallstreetbets,It's really a good company!  I bought 100 shares for the long haul last month.  I think it has real potential.
2021-06-09 16:20:15,wallstreetbets,Hopefully tomorrow isn't too horrible so my CLF call can print!

Lots of stock are getting massively shorted so it's tempting for someone to take ""gains"" (While leaving the real money on the table) and move on to something that has a lower price of entry.  


I got in on WorkHorse because at the time I could have gotten more share compare to AMC when I notice what was going on.  


Too much going on too many shorts are shorted it's nuts."

2021-06-09 16:18:41,wallstreetbets,So selling at 2000% is paper handed?
2021-06-09 16:34:17,wallstreetbets,I made money. Now hopefully this dip will make me some more. If I diamond hand everything I will not make money. I’m here to make money. My diamonds hands can’t hold every stock I buy forever.
2021-06-09 16:29:20,wallstreetbets,lol we came to a point where being called paperhand is a beautiful thing since it means u secured the bag a walked away with +50% profits while others bought the top and are waiting for tHe sQueeZe some random autist promised
2021-06-09 17:55:37,wallstreetbets,"CLOV is a shitty SPAC merger that is under DOJ investigation and has never posted a profit. People are using 3 week old data to figure it’s short interest is 36%. Definitely high, but not a GME short squeeze candidate. 

It’s volume over the last 2 days was 10x normal volume. Even if every single short seller covered (40mil), that still leaves 9x (320mil) the normal amount of volume being traded.

CLOV went up because a bunch of people who started trading stocks a month ago think everything is a short squeeze and buying shares means you’re killing hedge funds. This is a retail pump. And today, retail dumped. 

Protect yourself by taking gains when you make them."
2021-06-09 16:44:53,wallstreetbets,This sub is full of hedgies that are buying lots of small lots and 3 mo dte calls them marketing to the idiots here.  The idiots buy the shares and the hedgies sell their calls then bail leaving retail holding the bag.

2021-06-09 16:31:11,wallstreetbets,You can't just speak a squeeze into existence
2021-06-09 18:19:41,wallstreetbets,"So, basically you need to jump in as soon as possible. And get rid of them as soon as it meets your expectations like 100% is good enough. Don’t wait for 300%. It’s highly risk. So you got to act quick and evaluate the risk and reward. Once it is up, just move on! There are always opportunities. And it is not worth the 10000% risk for the 200% return possibility. Even so, more than half of the dd is fundamentally wrong and not even worth to put $ in no matter what"
2021-06-09 17:17:59,wallstreetbets,Maybe this whole thing was a pump and dump in the first place. Just maybe.

If a couple more big funds like Hwang go belly up then you could see banks start to actually check margin on big big short sellers. Until then, they will be able to hold their short position for years."

If BB drops below $14 by friday, therll be no hope as most of the calls wont be in strike price and therefore the sellers wont have to purchase shares. Everyone if you see a sharp drop in price don't panic and sell what you have too."
2021-06-09 16:43:53,wallstreetbets,Nobody here owes you a damned thing.
2021-06-09 16:27:02,wallstreetbets,Me too. Riding the waves
2021-06-09 17:01:02,wallstreetbets,Amen
2021-06-09 16:17:57,wallstreetbets,Guilty as charged 🚀😢

2021-06-09 17:12:55,wallstreetbets,"I fell for it.. I’m embarrassed, I’m ashamed but when I heard $WEN named a meal after y’all I thought oh man it’s got2b real   I know guys.. I know... hubs should divorce me, my bf should run away w my sister & my sugar daddy should cut me off"
2021-06-09 18:07:27,wallstreetbets,"Which with WSB's passion for loss porn, profit = good is even a stretch."
2021-06-09 17:26:09,wallstreetbets,"This guy gets it. Everyone expects to pump up their stock of choice, and no one has an exit strategy. I was happy with my 30% gain on $CLNE, I'm going to buy some tendies tonight in celebration. I'd be blown away by 2000%, and my jaw is on the floor that you had the balls to not sell sooner than that. Hats off to you, sir"
2021-06-09 16:28:01,wallstreetbets,"In this case, yes. 

What would DFV do?"
2021-06-09 16:33:32,wallstreetbets,Exactly lmao I’ll be a paper hand any day bc it means i profited. Some of these people find pride in bagholding. Gotta be a martyr complex.
2021-06-09 18:15:14,wallstreetbets,"I know here I am with thousands of dollars for doing nothing while all these guys are crying about people pushing other stocks cause they are left with the bag. Most guys ""diamond handing it"" are only doing it because they bought at the top and don't want to sell at a loss but disguise it like they are doing something for a cause. Nah your just an idiot"
2021-06-09 18:27:12,wallstreetbets,This. Take your gains folks. Not everything is a rocket ship. Some of it is skimming cash off the top during a pump and dump.
2021-06-09 16:29:11,wallstreetbets,Don’t be completely restarted apes just somewhat retarded
2021-06-09 17:44:33,wallstreetbets,"It’s not, institutions are only allowed to sell so much of their position at one time. On top of that, the institutions that own most of the stock aren’t shorting it…"

2021-06-09 16:22:19,wallstreetbets,RKT all over again. GME March spike followed a week after the RKT distraction
2021-06-09 19:17:49,wallstreetbets,I just don’t get it BB is really the only play I mean if we all just jumped in at this price we all could kill it but we spread our money out and everyone is bag holding BB is really the play at this price I’m only holding 500 shares and some long out calls but I’m just not getting it let’s all get on this and ride this train
2021-06-09 18:15:04,wallstreetbets,"30,000 patents owned! Some very serious, under the radar shit they have!"
2021-06-09 17:05:05,wallstreetbets,Better be. I’m in the hole on today’s calls. But still holding!
2021-06-09 17:19:43,wallstreetbets,Also bag holding $NOK and $CLOV deep in the red on both as I bought at the absolute high for each. Average cost per share on NOK is $6.74 and $27.00 for CLOV. I need some cash flow so I can average down cause I’m getting bent over right now.
2021-06-09 17:25:01,wallstreetbets,Let’s go $ NOK!!!
2021-06-09 17:09:56,wallstreetbets,I so want $NOK$ to take off
2021-06-09 16:58:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it's people who are selling after hours. Institutions are doing most of the selling. Look at GME and AMC after-hours today. Identical drops and gains. When these stocks start to have identical trading patterns, it's not because of individuals."
2021-06-09 16:24:01,wallstreetbets,You keep squeezing
2021-06-09 17:14:31,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-06-09 17:30:26,wallstreetbets,Thank you! I bought 11c 6/18 calls back when they were 0.55 per contract lol it ran AH and PM and opened at $10.35 ! I sold all but a couple and let that ride till this am around the peak lol closed those at $17.50. Anyone tell me they could’ve saw those gains and not sell is lying or dumb lmao
2021-06-09 16:30:33,wallstreetbets,Idgaf what would DFV do bc I think for myself. DFV doesn’t live my life. Doesn’t set my buy orders and definitely doesn’t set my sell limits.
2021-06-09 18:18:01,wallstreetbets,He’s watching our every move
2021-06-09 18:13:42,wallstreetbets,"My roommate fucking bought in early this morning and he’s holding the bag. He is one of the biggest diamond hand motherfuckers I know!!!! It’s impressive to watch to be honest. 

The funny thing is that true apes don’t care about money, they genuinely like the stonk. Whether it’s because a service, product or a short... we like the stonks"
2021-06-09 16:35:30,wallstreetbets,"DFV also had excellent DD and foresight, not a bot army pushing stocks. 2000% is fantastic. Congrats!"
2021-06-09 18:25:28,wallstreetbets,We need to get our shit together around here
2021-06-09 16:37:08,wallstreetbets,You got a fair point!! DFV did great DD. CLOV was a pump. I rode the wave up. Cashed out and bought puts that are now green af
2021-06-09 18:27:07,wallstreetbets,This is a 38% short float. An this is not I repeat NOT a shitty company. Short baztardz ruin company’s an people’s lives.
2021-06-09 16:39:34,wallstreetbets,"Good luck, in time I'm confident you'll regret those puts."
2021-06-09 16:43:22,wallstreetbets,I already cashed out 1/3 at a 75% gain. Looks like CLOV is falling AH. When I wake up I’ll be sure to sell another 1/3 for 100% :)
2021-06-09 16:48:53,wallstreetbets,Shieet I regret I didn't pull out sooner and catch another rocket than wait.
2021-06-09 16:11:28,wallstreetbets,I’m all in

2021-06-09 16:15:45,wallstreetbets,"Steel is the highest it’s ever been, q2 is going to blow q1 out of the water.been holding MT and CLF since January and those my strongest performing stocks."
2021-06-09 16:16:19,wallstreetbets,have been in since last month at $18 due to the booming steel prices
2021-06-09 16:49:08,wallstreetbets,This is a very good play and safe.  You earn div. and it is a inflation play.. As interest rates climb and they will in time.  This will as well..
2021-06-09 17:19:14,wallstreetbets,Steel build our country. Gonna buy more CLF tomorrow.
2021-06-09 16:38:54,wallstreetbets,Ok but isn't it too late? I don't want to jump in on the tail like with clov.
2021-06-09 17:26:32,wallstreetbets,"I think small to midcap American industrials are really going to take off because of infrastructure spending and general sentiment. A few examples that I've honed in on include Foster (FSTR), Graham Corp (GHM), Park Aerospace (PKE), Gulf Island Fabrication (GIFI), ATN International (ATNI), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Consolidated Communications (CNSL), and Genie Energy (GNE)."

2021-06-09 16:50:55,wallstreetbets,I mean the ceo is great but what about chinese steel. hasn't it been a huge factor and contribution to the decimation of the american steel industry that china can essentially undercut them and dump steel into the market?
2021-06-09 16:18:03,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure Apes love tbf. Apes love green lines and just follow ticker with biggest green line. Intuition tells me this tanks tomorrow, we'll see."

2021-06-09 16:22:23,wallstreetbets,Apes were writing about this one before today. Apes made green stick go up
2021-06-09 16:29:24,wallstreetbets,"Yeah.. but this rise wasn't Ape initiated. WSB has picked it up and run with it but, shit I picked up a few early doors as well but I'm quite skeptical the WSB momentum will carry through on this one."
2021-06-09 16:20:59,wallstreetbets,I’m glad we can all enjoy the fact we’re down money
2021-06-09 16:14:22,wallstreetbets,LOL and I was scared that I am down $700 bucks
2021-06-09 16:15:58,wallstreetbets,Bro wtf is going on how does it keep dropping. With all this volume and short interest.
2021-06-09 16:14:46,wallstreetbets,RIP.  Hold for the dead cat bounce?

2021-06-09 16:18:45,wallstreetbets,The thing about volume is that selling counts as volume
2021-06-09 16:17:04,wallstreetbets,I'm asking the same question
2021-06-09 16:24:42,wallstreetbets,"No, but of smart people who decided to take profits instead of sitting there looking at unrealized gains like a true retard"
2021-06-09 18:19:30,wallstreetbets,Yea I also fomo bought amc at 12 but I’m not regretting that one
2021-06-09 16:19:32,wallstreetbets,Yea I know but everyone was selling at 9:30-9:35am. Who the fuck would sell when that shit dropped 5-10 bucks in one day.
2021-06-09 16:24:06,wallstreetbets,If someone selling ......someone is buying 😂
2021-06-09 16:26:01,wallstreetbets,tell me ur a paper hand bitch without telling me ur a paper hand bitch

2021-06-09 18:26:52,wallstreetbets,Ah so you’ve never had to sit through a lose then?
2021-06-09 18:20:00,wallstreetbets,Bro go look at the amount of institutional share holders owning this thing. Tons of shorts and tons of holds too
2021-06-09 16:28:25,wallstreetbets,Since when is taking 2000% profits off the table paper handed? I rather be than than a bag holder lmao
2021-06-09 16:56:51,wallstreetbets,Guilty 🤚😩. Ima go back in and catch the rocket again once it goes off again. But for now ima laugh to the bank while that one person who dug a hole for themselves flame me
2021-06-09 16:27:05,wallstreetbets,I sold this am for 2000% profit. Paper hand or not I guarantee you’re bag holding rn
2021-06-09 16:13:28,wallstreetbets,"Thank you - it's a positive position compared to last year, but this is not overall a good result.

This being said; I'm bullish on the transformation and this report does show an improvement. HODL"
2021-06-09 17:17:39,wallstreetbets,GameStop dumping after an earnings beat officially makes it a tech stock. The turnaround is complete.
2021-06-09 16:19:51,wallstreetbets,And we are back at $300- another loss is another gain.  Buckled and ready 🚀
2021-06-09 17:22:24,wallstreetbets,GameStop 💪💪💪 you don’t turn a container ship with one swing of the wheel! This ship is changing direction quite quickly! See it turning from last earnings report and today’s. Epic stuff GameStop staff 🙌
2021-06-09 16:13:09,wallstreetbets,Nobody cares about fundamentals anymore or GME wouldn’t trade for $300.
2021-06-09 16:12:47,wallstreetbets,buckled up
2021-06-09 16:52:18,wallstreetbets,"Stock will be down 15% by tomorrow morning. Retards will likely buy the dip, and it'll rocket past it's earlier high today. Factor in the Amazon CEO/CFO onlining into GME and a more positive sentiment will probably stabilize the volatility until the next round of bullshit starts, probably."

2021-06-09 16:14:37,wallstreetbets,"So this is good news, why did the stock tank (after hours) almost $20 instantly?"
2021-06-09 16:19:24,wallstreetbets,"They appointed a bunch of ex-Amazon execs, they are just going to feed off the carcass at this point"
2021-06-09 17:40:40,wallstreetbets,"GME is likely going to pull a Fanatics situation. Don't be the one peddling and selling everyone's crap, be the one providing the solution to peddle everyone's crap as the officially licensed retailer to do so."
2021-06-09 16:10:27,wallstreetbets,Cohen NOT CEO

2021-06-09 16:15:32,wallstreetbets,Just keeping holding were in the long game now!
2021-06-09 16:33:53,wallstreetbets,"I'd say it is a good result. They've pretty much stopped the bleeding on all fronts and can now actually focus on making the transformation a reality. The revenue's will come, the profits will come, and most of all the MOASS will come. BUY HOLD and trust the process 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-09 16:19:01,wallstreetbets,Stock markets today simple: er beat = stock crash; er fail = stock moon
2021-06-09 16:23:33,wallstreetbets,"This isnt good news, its pretty bad news in the boomer world, the only people that would sell based on ANYTHING said for earnings would be boomers and institutions. 

If you thought for a second GME was going to have a ""good"" earnings you really do belong here.

You bought GME as a hype train, or a squeeze, if you bought GME based on fundamentals you are genuinely retarded."
2021-06-09 16:22:19,wallstreetbets,"Generally, regardless of whether a company posts good or bad earnings, stockholders will cash out. If its good, holders liquidate to take profit. If bad, holders liquidate to cut losses.

Just means the stock's on sale lol"
2021-06-09 16:19:51,wallstreetbets,"because when reality sets in and you compare their earnings to what their stock price is its garbage.

this is why people have said its overpriced for what the company is currently."
2021-06-09 16:53:18,wallstreetbets,"Another 5m shares to be sold ATM

No Ryan Cohen CEO

Numbers ok, not great 

No guidance

Market cap not sustainable given current growth, earnings, no buyback/dividends"
2021-06-09 16:17:53,wallstreetbets,Because these are terrible earnings for their market cap.
2021-06-09 16:18:16,wallstreetbets,BecauE noticing trades on fundamentals any more and my wife hates me.
2021-06-09 16:47:24,wallstreetbets,"This is the best quarter they are going to have. COVID reopening, MASSIVE amounts of free marketing... and they post this? Barely beating earnings. Plus another dilution. This is not good."
2021-06-09 16:11:31,wallstreetbets,"Cohen wasn't up for CEO. 

He's now the Chairman."
2021-06-09 16:12:05,wallstreetbets,"duh. he was always going to be the chairman, and he now is."
2021-06-09 16:16:32,wallstreetbets,Medium term I think.  Looking at price movement vs volume I think it's getting closer and closer
2021-06-09 16:37:11,wallstreetbets,"It's not, they're still a business which is losing money.  My points above still stand though, this is q1 so a couple of months ago, and I think q2 may pull into profitability.

I'm still bullish AF, but I'm not going to try and paint this as a GOOD result. Equally, I'm not painting it as bad either as it's a good improvement."

2021-06-09 16:28:36,wallstreetbets,"Very heavy rumors going on in the wrestling community that WWE is working on a deal to be bought by NBC very shortly. Several top names were cut in the middle of their TV storylines randomly, and it has been speculated that was done to help clear high value contracts that could hold up a sale."
2021-06-09 16:15:27,wallstreetbets,this guy fucks
2021-06-09 18:42:54,wallstreetbets,"Aside from the rumors, which are only just  that, WWE is actually  a financial  sound company.  Throughout  the pandemic  they have been cutting costs  left and right. They have let go many of their contract talent. Some involving a million $ a year.
 With the restart  of the economy  and ppl wanting to go back to normal, WWE has resumed  touring and that's a big part of their revenue.  Ticket sales and merch is where it's at and they made nothing during  the pandemic.  Also they have a new Chief  Revenue Officer, Nick Khan,  that seems to be the master mind behind lots of the changes happening. Hell they had Logan Paul on a PPV just a few months ago. Also WWE makes and owns a lot of content  outside of wrestling.  They make documentarys that wrestling  fans absolutely love and consume like crack addicts. This is a real shit DD but check the chart.  After today's bump there trading at prices equal to nov 2019. Its only up from here  🚀🚀🚀"

2021-06-09 16:38:33,wallstreetbets,we tried uranium last year. never took off. could we go nuclear this year? 🏭
2021-06-09 16:35:18,wallstreetbets,Wtf is this?
2021-06-09 16:58:23,wallstreetbets,"The etf is illiquid for options.  No one's gonna buy it. There are better uranium plays than this. Your other  chart contains a stock trading at .35 Aussie dollars.  I suspect it's market cap doesn't meet the rules.  

Ban."
2021-06-09 18:42:25,wallstreetbets,Ditto to the max. Loaded down. NXE and URNM are my only other holdings.

2021-06-09 17:40:28,wallstreetbets,what's the 1 min thesis?
2021-06-09 17:32:18,wallstreetbets,Could not agree more! they are joining the Russel 3000 at the end of the month. Same idea as the etf albeit smaller effect I would think!
2021-06-09 17:04:44,wallstreetbets,in July. Urnm is in september

2021-06-09 17:05:41,wallstreetbets,I am happy to elaborate if you care to elaborate your WTF
2021-06-09 17:04:23,wallstreetbets,You could check that for yourself in 2 sec.. And they both meet the criteria which is only 30 million caps for URNM. I think you should be banned because you did not take 2 seconds to check this out before making an accusation.
2021-06-09 17:43:19,wallstreetbets,Buy uranium Equities now
2021-06-09 17:44:50,wallstreetbets,"Low market cap (300 million) in combination with its Wyoming leases. You're talking lots of land and deposits, and a deep red state hungry for industry to support a struggling local economy. Regulation could be lax if right people came into power. I also think the Lost Creek project could be promising. It's a highly speculative play but I think the possible returns are worth taking the gamble if you have the cash to spare."

a  proven producer , they have another project and can ramp up to 2 million lbs for $50 million ...It's not much of a gamble"

2021-06-09 16:21:51,wallstreetbets,You seem a bit confused. BB is a solid stock.
2021-06-09 16:17:26,wallstreetbets,Think ur getting BB confused with clov and wish chief
2021-06-09 16:18:53,wallstreetbets,clov and wish were bots
2021-06-09 18:25:05,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of it revolves around our focus being splintered into all these new names; clov, wkhs, wish, clne etc etc. We were about to pop and were taking over reddit with BB name mentions and then a few days later everybody is fractured and 4-5 different names are being endlessly pumped on WSB. I am long and strong BB, I sold some of my call options purchased in April on Monday and I will be adding shares with the proceeds if it dips significantly. 4800 shares long and strong."
2021-06-09 16:26:18,wallstreetbets,"Once it moves below $14 thats a time to start worrying. $15 is actually real comfortable, we just need to keep seeing high volumes, and once we break through $20, there will be no stopping it.

Edit: WE formed a bit of a cup & handle, right now is old bag-holding investors all selling. We HAVE to see this stock break \~$20 or it will not surge."
2021-06-09 17:59:42,wallstreetbets,Guess what I don’t own🤣. It was a crapshoot at open today. 3 zeros behind the numbers in the loss column in the swing trades. If you made some money that’s bad ass. That’s why we play the game. Good luck.
2021-06-09 16:24:08,wallstreetbets,But is it worth its current SP or higher?  At this time no.
2021-06-09 16:31:39,wallstreetbets,This is a June 11th expiration date.
2021-06-09 16:33:02,wallstreetbets,I think you're too retarded to see this is an option and not shares.
2021-06-09 16:29:44,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Considering the other companies doing similar stuff and it's potential. Of all these meme stocks, BB is the most solid one."
2021-06-09 16:36:34,wallstreetbets,I’m not commenting about the bad calls. I’m commenting about you saying BB is a pump and dump stock
2021-06-09 16:53:08,wallstreetbets,I’m holding to give my parents a happier retirement…

2021-06-09 19:54:39,wallstreetbets,Diamond handing will kill you in the long run with meme stocks. Take your profit. You could miss out on more yes but it’ll feel better than holding until you’re at a loss
2021-06-09 16:26:24,wallstreetbets,Should of sold when it was at 70.
2021-06-09 18:55:37,wallstreetbets,"Maybe consider flipping that into something else, there's a lot of opportunity out there"

A few examples that I've honed in on include Foster (FSTR), Graham Corp (GHM), Park Aerospace (PKE), Gulf Island Fabrication (GIFI), ATN International (ATNI), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Consolidated Communications (CNSL), and Genie Energy (GNE)."

2021-06-09 17:33:34,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the informative post. My only concern with NIO is the high market cap. I honestly believe that there are small to midcap innovative Chinese tech companies that could easily be valued at over 25 billion USD and I wouldn't be surprised. There's the country risk that everyone talks about, but that's the whole reason companies like them are undervalued. High risk very high reward. Companies HUYA, WIMI, ZEPP, DOYU, JKS, JWEL, IFBD, MOMO, BLCT, MKD, etc. A ton of cheap innovation with high gains potential. There could be a smear campaign going on to keep these shares cheap long enough for rich connected folk to get all their money in. It obviously isn't a certainty, but worth the gamble if you ask me."
2021-06-09 16:12:51,wallstreetbets,Nio has good potential YOY deliveries increase. Holding long term and buying dips. $100 EOY.

2021-06-09 18:26:19,wallstreetbets,"The annual migration of North America’s monarch butterfly is a unique and amazing phenomenon. The monarch is the only butterfly known to make a two-way migration as birds do. Unlike other butterflies that can overwinter as larvae, pupae, or even as adults in some species, monarchs cannot survive the cold winters of northern climates. Using environmental cues, the monarchs know when it is time to travel south for the winter. Monarchs use a combination of air currents and thermals to travel long distances. Some fly as far as 3,000 miles to reach their winter home."

the trick to making money on meme stocks is to buy in BEFORE they pump, if you are buying in after shit just went up 100% in 2 days you are asking for trouble

try looking for stocks with meme potential that have been steadily climbing/stable over a month, and buy at that point

2021-06-09 17:35:51,wallstreetbets,"I honestly believe small to midcap American companies with innovation potential are going to see astronomical gains because of the combination of infrastructure spending and speculative investing. Money is going to be racing into these companies before it's too late. Companies such as Asensus Surgical (ASXC), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Meatech (MITC), UR Energy (URG), Agrify (AGFY), Vision Marine (VMAR), CNSL, CMLS, EBIX, PKE, RMTI, FSTR, Genie Energy (GNE), GHM, GIFI, JAKK, LFVN, Aemetis (AMTX), ATNI, Audacy (AUD) and BBGI could likely fly. I also like innovative small to midcap Chinese companies. There's the country risk that everyone talks about, but that's the whole reason companies like them are undervalued. High risk very high reward. Companies like HUYA, WIMI, ZEPP, DOYU, JKS, JWEL, IFBD, MOMO, BLCT, MKD, etc. A ton of cheap innovation with high gains potential. There could be a smear campaign going on to keep these shares cheap long enough for rich connected folk to get all their money in. It obviously isn't a certainty, but worth the gamble if you ask me."

2021-06-09 19:16:05,wallstreetbets,Buying heaps of WPRT because it's undervalued like the other automotive stocks and it's a good cheap buy in with a lot of room to grow. P/E is 185.65 at 6 bucks a share and they manufacture OEM and IAM parts for vehicles along with low emission fuel and natural gas and high performance fuel. It's a diverse company that has several ventures in its cap and I believe that this will set it to explode in value the same way WKHS did.

Don't sweat the small stuff.

I expect Jim Cramer to claim he saw all this terrible shit coming and claim divine insight too so don't be surprised to hear nostradumus tomorrow ""I knew Gamestock was just a joke MEME stock"".

2021-06-09 16:20:36,wallstreetbets,"Ticker Tribalism is overrated. 

If the only way your stock can go up is if you drown out the support for all the other stocks on WSB. It's probably not a good play to begin with. 🤡

Have you noticed almost everyone promoting $CLNE doesn't feel the need to point out that $CLOV, $WISH, $WEN, or $BB is underperforming today?

That's because we understand, the value and merit of our stock. That's because we know this a $24+ value stock with solid fundamentals. That's because we know if we can maintain $CLNE about $13 on 6/18 we'll trigger the biggest squeeze of the summer.

We don't need to put down any other ticker to uplift our agenda. If you belive in another stock, good for you I hope you make lots of money. If you got burned, I'm sorry for your loss.

Join the winning $CLNE team, there's plenty of room for everyone on the moon.

Or don't, that's okay too. We won't shame you for sitting this one out.

WISH is a good stock you’re right about the fundamentals, but right now is the WORST time to buy it.. and if you got 150k in shares you not selling premarket cost you at least 75k today.

2021-06-09 19:46:56,wallstreetbets,"Traditionally, it has not. Steel stocks move slowly and for the most part stick with the indexes (Russel 2000 is best representative). Even when steel prices (HRC futures) rise 4%, which translates to pure profit at these steel prices, the steel stocks don't move with it. They are utterly slept on, and it's why I've been long on steel for two months now.

So the answer to your question is: Whatever the market as a whole does is likely what us steel will do. CLF is probably an exception at this point, given how much attention it is getting."

2021-06-09 17:31:13,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. If any stock is going to run, it's going to be WKHS. It just needs to flat for a few more days."
2021-06-09 19:35:20,wallstreetbets,lol this is bad advice
2021-06-09 16:09:54,wallstreetbets,Because you don’t like steady 7% gains day after day?
2021-06-09 17:05:04,wallstreetbets,Yeah man you need to learn how to read the market better first. Invest and watch what things do daily. You’ll get eaten up in fast moving trades.
2021-06-09 17:58:16,wallstreetbets,Yes

What does this mean for you? STEEL will go brrrrr  🔥🚀🌕💵🤑

$CLF is the play."
2021-06-09 16:24:15,wallstreetbets,Solid company. Inflation equals commodities rise. Steel is a sleek play then. Company is heavily undervalued. Have a solid track record of how to pay off their debt. And not an actual garbage company like G M E. Or A M C
2021-06-09 16:53:26,wallstreetbets,Bro I turned 3k into 18k just fomoing on WEN and WISH. You’re a loser 😂

2021-06-09 17:36:29,wallstreetbets,"Awesome to see your gains on an American Industrial Company. I think small to midcap American industrials are really going to take off because of infrastructure spending and general sentiment. A few examples that I've honed in on include Foster (FSTR), Graham Corp (GHM), Park Aerospace (PKE), Gulf Island Fabrication (GIFI), ATN International (ATNI), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Consolidated Communications (CNSL), and Genie Energy (GNE)."

I honestly believe small to midcap American companies with innovation potential are going to see astronomical gains because of the combination of infrastructure spending and speculative investing.

Companies such as Asensus Surgical (ASXC), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Meatech (MITC), UR Energy (URG), Agrify (AGFY), Vision Marine (VMAR), CNSL, CMLS, EBIX, PKE, RMTI, FSTR, Genie Energy (GNE), GHM, GIFI, JAKK, LFVN, Aemetis (AMTX), ATNI, Audacy (AUD) and BBGI could likely fly over the next few years."

2021-06-09 16:04:48,wallstreetbets,"The biggest lesson I learned is that even if every post on WSB is pushing a ticker and it has a good day, you have no idea who the people posting are really working for, and the next day the tendieman can take it all away and much more.  Take your gains on unicorn pumps when you have them.  Phantom losses are much easier to live with than real losses or bag holding for months."
2021-06-09 16:17:30,wallstreetbets,Was wondering the same thing 290 million volume today and it dropped. But still buying will take off soon🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-09 19:06:29,wallstreetbets,"because the get rich quick idiots are panic selling like crazy and the smart people are buying up every single one of those shares at an amazing rock bottom price. when price fluctuates downwards, there are more sellers and when it fluctuates upwards there are more buyers. and with all that chop there are scalpers playing the volatility buying and selling repeatedly every minute"
2021-06-09 15:54:40,wallstreetbets,Thank you for making me feel better at 11.47
2021-06-09 15:55:17,wallstreetbets,"exactly, even if i lose some cash right now, I know it'll go up eventually"
2021-06-09 16:07:53,wallstreetbets,Feels much more like a huge coordinated short attack than paper hands to me.  But I guess we can see what happens tomorrow and Friday!
2021-06-09 16:14:10,wallstreetbets,"I never really YOLO.  But I have been having a great month and figured what could go wrong???  Germany really got me though as WISH was up 3 points there above the US AH high and I said, well, better buy at 4am at $17.50, cause it was going to $20!  It wasn’t."
2021-06-09 16:31:30,wallstreetbets,I love that you knew I was not dressed.  Tried to sleep.  The nightmares were too intense.
2021-06-09 16:45:46,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is literally a casino"
2021-06-09 16:22:08,wallstreetbets,"Same. I was actually able to catch AMC and CLOV at a good time thanks to this sub, so I'm happy about that. But I know when to stop. I took my profits and put them into my Vanguard ETFs."
2021-06-09 16:05:26,wallstreetbets,"Same here, not worried tho because either way its a good long term investment with great potential!"
2021-06-09 19:01:04,wallstreetbets,Probably lettuce hand this one.  🥬
2021-06-09 18:24:29,wallstreetbets,"Ahh, a long time holder of the bags.  Hats off to you good sir.  Hopefully $15 or $7 tomorrow.  I’d rather they get me out at breakeven or bring me max pain as quickly as possible so I can double down and get out that much faster.  In theory!"
2021-06-09 16:20:17,wallstreetbets,Yup.  I knew it was garbage the first time I used the app and saw everything was a joke at best to send to your friends.  But everyone should also know CLOV has a ton of problems and is run by billionaires with shady billing practices and ongoing SEC and DOJ investigations.  Greed ruins lives.  I’m curious if these repump or simply go completely back to where they were a day ago.
2021-06-09 19:08:56,wallstreetbets,A month?!?  Who can possibly hold that long!  I actually had to hold HUMBL for almost six months before getting back to my average recently.  I hope it’s $10 tomorrow or less so I can add a ton more.  Two truly retard moves back to back sometimes creates a true autist result.

2021-06-09 15:57:54,wallstreetbets,I actually sold at $14 but then like a true retard bought back in at between $13-$11.  I guess I’m hoping for $7.80 for a complete dump.
2021-06-09 18:18:12,wallstreetbets,"I normally would agree with ure statement , however wish under 20,00 USD is a joke regardless of Reddit army supporting it. They have considerable revenue , with massive growth in logistics revenue , and development of wish local network, current fair value should be placed between 20-40 usd range , not 10-15 range, it go destroyed by shorting on top of lock up expiration , with Reddit putting on some revenge i would like to see 3 digits range not fair value range."
2021-06-09 15:56:39,wallstreetbets,My dumbass bought it at 11.69 thinking it would blow up... but gonna hold mine as well
2021-06-09 19:02:44,wallstreetbets,"if your expectations for success are massive profits 1 or 2 days after buying in then you are going to be disappointed often by the stock market, retard."

2021-06-09 18:34:38,wallstreetbets,"As an e-commerce platform with DD and fundamentals I agree.  Any position under $20 is a good hold.  The IPO was cut down insanely.  But the same thing happened to SNAP and Facebook and it took a long time for them to recover.  So as a wrinkle brained long term investor, I fully agree with you and should park my bags and move on with my life until the $20 departure flight is leaving.  Sadly, I am a smooth brained flashing lights car chasing ape retard and may get out at breakeven the first chance I get lest I have to hold this for a year and miss other shiny bobble pumps.  Kills me because I was up $10k on this yesterday in AH but just knew it was gonna pump more today and had to do that YOLO.  And you’d say, no you stupid ape, don’t chase those flashing lights into oncoming traffic!  But those shiny beads of glass made me almost $900k in the last year by following absolute garbage and own poop eating logic that makes our boy Jim Cramer pop his shiny bald top.  If it’s still down tomorrow I’m closing some puts I sold that are way in the money and will grab more of this currently absolute feces train for the next pump."
2021-06-09 16:10:16,wallstreetbets,Dumb together bro
2021-06-09 19:04:44,wallstreetbets,"Wait, this isn’t a casino?!?"
2021-06-09 17:09:01,wallstreetbets,My great month was +$200k so this hurts but it’s not time to drive off a cliff.  I will have forced patience with this now and if it goes back to $9 will just add another $100k.  So it can go to $7 😂
2021-06-09 16:26:56,wallstreetbets,"In simplest terms. When the stock is going crazy, millions of shares trading hands, everyone wants in, options prices go up (supply and demand). Not a great time to FOMO when IV is crazy high."
2021-06-09 16:31:16,wallstreetbets,"It’s the volatility of the underlying (share price) on which an options contract is based. It’s one of the things that effects the value of the contract.

Generally speaking, the value of an options contract is higher when the IV is higher. So when a stock is massively hyped, or approaching earnings, you’ll see the IV spike, causing increased contract value.

If you’re buying calls for example, you’d want to buy the contract when the IV is low (I always try to buy at under 100%) and sell it when it’s high.

Some of the recent meme stocks have had insane IV, in some cases 600% or higher. It’s a very risky move to buy contracts when the IV is so high as the value will absolutely plummet when the IV drops back down."
2021-06-09 17:24:18,wallstreetbets,Lol. Good luck!
2021-06-09 16:27:36,wallstreetbets,"Got it, thank you!"
2021-06-09 16:37:38,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the explanation, it makes sense to me but I haven't traded options yet so no experience with it. So basically the higher the IV, the higher demand for that contract at that point in time, the more valuable the contract is. Did I get that right?"
2021-06-09 16:41:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah essentially.

Also something to be aware of is IV crush. This happens when the underlying share price goes up, but the value of the contract ends up going down. It often happens if you hold a contract through earnings. After earnings the IV will drop, and if there hasn’t been a significant enough rise in underlying share price, the contract value will go down. People get super confused when the share price goes up after earnings but their options contract loses value. 

Super important to take note of IV, as well as the Greeks, before trading options"

2021-06-09 16:08:28,wallstreetbets,I made 6k off them this morning alone. One I was shorting them since yesterday to get a little bear money which was 2k & this morning I sold puts at 9 which i rebought netting me a profit of 4k. Now I entered the posted position an hr ago & sold covered calls to limit my down size which will net me 11k by the end of friday. Heavy money bags here.
2021-06-09 16:02:02,wallstreetbets,Definitely a fair bull argument

2021-06-09 19:48:28,wallstreetbets,Well done you beautiful ape.
2021-06-09 15:54:53,wallstreetbets,What’s a good SNDL Call option? I’m looking at 7/16 $1.50
2021-06-09 16:13:55,wallstreetbets,"Umm, super smooth brain here, some even say smoother than glass. Anyway, why would short interest vs daily volume mean much of anything on its own ?

Ex, company A has 100 mil shares available, company A daily average volume is 2 mil, how you say ? Not everything is amc or gme with 100’s of millions in volume a day. Also, institutional shareholders don’t always trade shares back and forth all day, another possibility, a few whales that bought in early and holding till potential buyout probably not moving millions of shares a day either. 

So company A, if they shorted shares were 5.0 or 5x daily volume, wow that so high right. Except that’s only 10 mill. Even at only 20% float theirs still more than enough shares available to cover in next to no time.

Not saying it’s bad DD or not putting any personal opinion on SNDL, just stating short interest ratio without lots more data to apply it to means basically nothing. You put together one corner of a puzzle, and your telling us what picture the puzzle will make, you have much more data to collect before this can be taken as serious or any potential at all for a short squeeze (remember short squeezes are super rare, no sure when we all forgot this)

Also pump and dumps are not and will never be short squeezes."

And unfortunately yet again. You either chose not to read a damn word but reply to someone, Or your just trying to be an ass 🤡yourself. I gave and example, “company A” I read every word you wrote. Absolutely no where did you say it was 300m average. Just because you did a shit job writing up your DD that I can only assume your expecting some kinda praise for, your not getting it when you do a shit job writing it up.

2021-06-09 17:09:19,wallstreetbets,You better hold. The lowest price since IPO is $7.52. We are closer to the bottom price than the top price of $30+. Worst case it goes back at least to its IPO price. This company definitely has potential.
2021-06-09 18:46:23,wallstreetbets,I'm with ya
2021-06-09 18:57:30,wallstreetbets,You didn't lose anything 😉
2021-06-09 19:21:24,wallstreetbets,"This happened today after hours with $WISH cost jumped to $14.68

https://imgur.com/a/ehDO3EV

Not sure why 🤔"
2021-06-09 16:28:31,wallstreetbets,and/or the option expires worthless
2021-06-09 16:42:42,wallstreetbets,I hate this statement so much
2021-06-09 16:50:37,wallstreetbets,I was up 800+ and now 27+ 😟
2021-06-09 15:57:31,wallstreetbets,"I lost quiet a bit too, but I'm not worried tbh. Undervalued and good long term potential on this either way."
2021-06-09 15:54:01,wallstreetbets,I think we have the same bag
2021-06-09 16:10:19,wallstreetbets,"You don't ""invest"" in meme stocks, it's a gamble. I have no idea why people put in so much money into this. The risk of losing most of it is huge.

I made money on wish because I sold at opening. I don't believe any of the stuff being peddled in this subreddit. It's just manipulation of your emotions.

If you want to be successful in the stock market, it's about risk management as number 1 and emotional intelligence and self control as number 2. Or you become broke quick.

You really should take a real trading course. If you are interested, I can recommend a good one that wont cheat you and will teach you very valuable skills. I'm in it myself."
2021-06-09 15:54:11,wallstreetbets,Not much else you can do then hold.
2021-06-09 18:00:28,wallstreetbets,"yes definitely. its only down because of how high it went so quickly overnight that people sold off in the morning for profits. it kept its strength pretty well after the drop from the morning sell.

if you cant handle to see the line go up, AND down, then the stock market is not for you"
2021-06-09 16:15:26,wallstreetbets,"Well, you lose when you sell. But also when your contracts expire."
2021-06-09 17:02:23,wallstreetbets,More or less the same position for me too... I started with 500 on AMC flipped it up to 13k now I'm down to 5k. Not a loss unless I sell though amirite.
2021-06-09 18:12:59,wallstreetbets,"i think what you meant to say was ""I WASNT PATIENT ENOUGH SO I HAD TO PANIC AND SELL IT ALL FOR A LOSS SINCE MY EXPECTATION FOR SUCCESS WAS 400% GAINS WITHIN A FEW HOURS"""
2021-06-09 17:18:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah your loss is unrealized, but your net worth is down for real."
2021-06-09 18:02:35,wallstreetbets,so? GME went back down to $46 after the first panic sell off by retards and selfish cunts
2021-06-09 16:18:27,wallstreetbets,Stupid Apes like 🍌🍌🍌
2021-06-09 16:18:29,wallstreetbets,That's only if you trade options.
2021-06-09 18:25:54,wallstreetbets,"I mean i want Lambo fast, not when I'm 60 lol"
2021-06-09 17:36:21,wallstreetbets,"You mean like the OP who ""you only lose if you sell"" was just directed to?"
2021-06-09 17:37:30,wallstreetbets,"""You only lose when you sell"" is an extremely common, general purpose statement when related to stocks."
2021-06-09 17:43:36,wallstreetbets,"Dont try and lecture me about the etymology of your favorite catch phrase. Options trading, particularly when your FD's are fucked is the most absurdly inappropriate time to say something so foolish. ""YoU OnLy LoSe If YoU SeLL""

Move along, and stop picking fights cuz your bummed it was a bad day to be in on a P&D. Direct your anger on something else like the dick youll be sucking for $10 and a chocolate frosty."
2021-06-09 17:48:52,wallstreetbets,"All I care about is etymology, certainly not games of money chicken."
2021-06-09 18:08:54,wallstreetbets,"youre the one who sounds like a bitter little cunt, tbh"
2021-06-09 18:34:17,wallstreetbets,relax. You can unwad your panties. GME will be back above three bills by opening bell.
2021-06-09 16:05:37,wallstreetbets,"Love the thoughtful run through. Been in AMRS for years but doubled down on the dip below 11.

Up 130k babayyyy"

2021-06-09 15:59:11,wallstreetbets,"I sold last Wednesday, partied for a week now re-enjoying"
2021-06-09 16:02:05,wallstreetbets,I sold my 6/18 $30 calls last Weds too before close. Partying with ya.
2021-06-09 15:49:38,wallstreetbets,Hmm. Gonna wait for this to flag and then buy in. Why would it be a good opportunity to buy now?
2021-06-09 15:55:57,wallstreetbets,OMG literally no this is so so so retarded. The upfronts were trash. They're crossing their fingers that they're going to get a wider audience... I don't see that happening.
2021-06-09 16:22:13,wallstreetbets,You must be new around here

2021-06-09 15:49:39,wallstreetbets,There’s so much going on with steel right now that you haven’t even included ; China isn’t exporting any steel at all and HRC prices are so high the tariffs don’t even matter - I tried to post something to this thread regarding price of steel but mods are whack af
2021-06-09 16:12:49,wallstreetbets,I live in northern MN. Iron ore capital of the world. and the mines are raging!!!!  They can’t produce enough fast enough right now.  They are making bank right now.  And construction boom is unreal for steel.  My construction projects have steel 8 months out because of demand!   Ape builds buildings and wants more clf
2021-06-09 15:47:58,wallstreetbets,We just like this stock
2021-06-09 16:15:30,wallstreetbets,"Steel=Always hard

2021-06-09 16:35:21,wallstreetbets,balls of steel
2021-06-09 15:59:36,wallstreetbets,This sucker gives me gains everyday
2021-06-09 17:49:33,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the counter argument. I suppose the reason people don't worry so much about tariffs is that the landscape has fundamentally changed because of China's approach to exporting. Export rebate has been axed and China is now far more concerned about its co2 emissions and own access to steel (see eg import duties relaxed on scrap - used as a more environmentally friendly way to make steel).
2021-06-09 15:56:26,wallstreetbets,We just like this stock
2021-06-09 17:48:49,wallstreetbets,I just bought 6668 shares and wish me luck 😉

2021-06-09 15:44:27,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the bag holders club it’s not that bad in BB

2021-06-09 15:44:24,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂 hope you didn’t sell amc for this.
2021-06-09 15:47:04,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands baby 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-09 15:50:28,wallstreetbets,So is it over because I’m down a grand on the day?
2021-06-09 15:47:54,wallstreetbets,Everyone claiming it’s a pump and dump then pumping amc/gme lol
2021-06-09 15:43:40,wallstreetbets,Pump and dump mate seen it a mile off
2021-06-09 15:47:36,wallstreetbets,We told y’all it was a pump and dump lol
2021-06-09 15:45:40,wallstreetbets,Everyone warned that clovr was a pump and dump man. U shouldve put that into amc/gme for a chance at the squeeze. I hope ur gonna be aight
2021-06-09 15:43:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah I never pull out in time
2021-06-09 15:44:10,wallstreetbets,A classic guh
2021-06-09 15:44:15,wallstreetbets,damn
2021-06-09 15:49:36,wallstreetbets,This is why you ignore those “hey everyone this is the next stock” posts. $amc and $gme are the only valuable plays. Nothing else is comparable by data. Short interest percentage isn’t everything.
2021-06-09 15:46:40,wallstreetbets,My fucking hero!  You should have that made into a poster!
2021-06-09 15:48:03,wallstreetbets,I suddenly don’t feel as bad for my $15c currently out the money

2021-06-09 15:59:01,wallstreetbets,My man went all in on a stock that was already 300% up.
2021-06-09 15:59:16,wallstreetbets,So far..
2021-06-09 16:13:15,wallstreetbets,"LMAOOO, how do people not know to never buy when the market opens"
2021-06-09 16:18:05,wallstreetbets,"You have shares, you're good."
2021-06-09 16:22:31,wallstreetbets,If media is pushing a stock why would you listen? This is nothing more than a trap and a way for the hedgies to have more liquidity. Stop falling for this crap. It will happen again and again. Don’t take your eye off of the real prize. 🍿
2021-06-09 16:56:02,wallstreetbets,You about to get PDT margin call tomorrow. Good luck man! 100% diversity jesus!
2021-06-09 17:45:04,wallstreetbets,"If your phone dies out, did you really lose anything?"
2021-06-09 15:48:59,wallstreetbets,I pulled out when CLOV first hit $20. Doubled my investment and bounced. Though that $27 peak was pretty damn sexy.
2021-06-09 15:54:20,wallstreetbets,Fucking lies
2021-06-09 15:48:37,wallstreetbets,Yeah facts his 12 thousand loss will turn into a 20 thousand dollar loss overnight.
2021-06-09 15:54:03,wallstreetbets,Lies don’t fall this bullshit lol 😂
2021-06-09 15:50:46,wallstreetbets,been bag holding since Jan... eh... it is what it is... you only lose when you sell low lol >!\*at least that's what I tell my self to be relatively sane \*crying on the inside\* !<
2021-06-09 17:18:34,wallstreetbets,"With BB, that bitch is tanking also..."
2021-06-09 15:51:37,wallstreetbets,I believe that was Wayne Gatsby the sportsball player.
2021-06-09 15:57:20,wallstreetbets,Hope not i lost $800 😭
2021-06-09 15:55:22,wallstreetbets,"those are a short squeeze, notice game stop is still up even months after the squeeze"
2021-06-09 16:54:01,wallstreetbets,"Youre being down voted by those fucking double agents. When in reality youre right, AMC & GME are the go to. The ONLY. This page is now infested with distractions and misinformation. I see less and and less ""Ape"" here and I see only hedge monkeys and their spam bots, FUD tactics. There was no reason for your comment to be down voted like that. Trust nobody talking about any other stock for right now... maybe not ever, this page is infiltrated. Even if there's an actual  decent stock with some potential, it decreases interests in the real bananas. Interest elsewhere is not Ape minded, Real Ape only knows GameStop and AMC. Hedge monkeys are NOT APE."

2021-06-09 17:22:03,wallstreetbets,AMC launched to $36 before “tanking” back to $24 for a bit before mooning. Stay on the sidelines if you want
2021-06-09 15:56:18,wallstreetbets,This is true. Doesn’t hurt to squeeze then move on after. Mainly my point is not helpful to bash other people here :/
2021-06-09 16:56:58,wallstreetbets,I already know this brother ape. The fud doesn’t affect me anymore. I know some will be crushed by it but not this ape. I appreciate your comment though.🙌

2021-06-09 16:25:01,wallstreetbets,It does hurt. Hedge funds gained liquidity and are laughing at all of you guys. Don’t get side tracked

I guess it was best to skip buying stocks today and wait for tomorrow.

I was surprised you asked me to edit my first post to your specifications.

&#x200B;

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with buying stocks, I'm saying those tickers had suspicious amounts of pumping last night here that didn't feel right.  Then a lot of people lost a lot of money investing in them.  That's two sides of a triangle, I'm free to deduce the other one.

&#x200B;

There are things coming out about AMC specifically this week that are pretty shocking.  Just like SLVR, something that was pumped here during GME's first run out of nowhere including INSTANT MEDIA CONFIRMATION of the supposed ""new pick"" while not being organically fomented here, these stocks took pressure off of AMC in a critical moment.  I'm an investor, investors get suspicions based on the environment.  Manipulation occurs often.  I made money on CLOV so I'm not really complaining, just saying that it was sus"

2021-06-09 16:23:31,wallstreetbets,No I don’t know lol I’m new to the market:)
2021-06-09 16:26:46,wallstreetbets,"Futures contracts are contracts to buy certain commodities in the future. Each commodity is backed by the commodity they represent. For example, if you buy a Lumber contract, you are buying a contract that allows you to take delivery of 110,000 feet of lumber.

There are cotton, silver, gold, wood, cattle, corn, oil... the list goes on .

Since you are knew to the market, I suggest you do a little research on a topic before you blindly comment with your opinions on the matter. Good Luck!"
2021-06-09 16:28:22,wallstreetbets,Thanks! And I wasn’t trying to dissuade people:) just thought it was worth mentioning lumber prices are gonna keep goin up for a couple years that’s all lol. But I’ll do more research in the future.

2021-06-09 15:54:58,wallstreetbets,"Kinds wild that Tesla can’t get fsd down, but dominos pizza autonomous can"
2021-06-09 16:14:18,wallstreetbets,"A lot of stuff here makes sense within our current realm of understanding but I think it can downplay human potential in constant innovation especially in things such as technology. As you yourself know a lot of these statistical models have been around for many years but haven’t really been applied for ML at this level for companies until later 2000’s and that’s because of how much power we have now with computers. Just compare a computer from 2000 till now, in my own lifetime they’ve changed a lot and will continue to keep getting better.

5 years I can get that setting up FSD would be extremely difficult but when we think of changes in things like quantum computing and how that potentially can become commercial I think that can heavily influence what’s possible. Even now people are creating algorithms to protect data encryption from quantum computing because of how powerful they are. I can’t imagine companies being able to utilize that power. As we’ve seen in the tech field things are constantly changing. Is 5 yrs a crazy timeline? Probably, our lifetime? Who knows really. ML has really blown up in popularity and use since 2000 so I can’t imagine how things might look in another 10-20yrs"
2021-06-09 16:23:03,wallstreetbets,"> So with that out of the way, here are 4 reasons, why there wont be any (level 4) FSD cars in the next 5 years, not from Tesla, and not from anyone else. Let me start with the non - technical ones.

https://www.npr.org/2021/06/05/1003623528/california-approves-pilot-program-for-driverless-rides

Looks like level 4 is already here?"
2021-06-09 17:09:49,wallstreetbets,"This is a very solid DD.  I agree that we are extremely far off from autonomous driving.  Things would have to be much much different for it to be possible in my mind.

Biggest would be having a full network of autonomous vehicles, so many decisions would be simplified if there were no human driven cars to worry about so that it's much easier to anticipate or predict what the vehicles around you are doing.  Think standardized actions when certain inputs are reached.  The key is having all the vehicles communicating with each other or viewing the surrounding vehicles inputs to help predict the actions of the vehicles around yours.

Anyway, everything you've brought up is very informative.  I think the current best application for the data is more beneficial to the older car manufacturers with better servicing capabilities.  Think of adding more sensors to evaluate the status of individual components of the motors and similar.  Over time you can start to have predictive maintenance of components as some may be giving similar readings before being fully destroyed giving an indication to the driver that a sensor/component will need to be replaced before the part has had a chance to fail yet.

Many heavy industrial equipment manufacturers have started using big data for this exactly.  It helps to streamline their service business and drive higher customer satisfaction by reducing downtime.  Anyways, thanks for your input as I have been thinking the same that Tesla was the first to the table but the technology can't grow fast enough to prevent the true car manufacturers to catch up and possibly better use the technology that currently exists."

2021-06-09 16:37:39,wallstreetbets,"I looked into quantum computing last year, because a friend of mine from university is in a quantum computing startup that was actually bought up by one of the bigger players. I don't think they are anywhere close to commercial use, and it also does not seem to be the general solution to all NP hard problems that some people thought it might be.

2021-06-09 16:19:30,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't answer my question, but sure"
2021-06-09 16:19:06,wallstreetbets,Deepmind's research project started in 2014 and Alphago started beating GMs in 2016?
2021-06-09 16:35:51,wallstreetbets,"Your question does not make sense. 

You compare driving a car with beating a GM in chess. Why not compare driving a car with playing chess at all? Anyone can learn it in 5 minutes I would say.

Beating a GM is equally as hard as beating lets say a Formula 1 driver in ""car driving"".

With that out of the way, it is still not the core of the problem I mentioned. The simplicity of the game is actually only relevant for the data problems. The data in chess or Go is very binary - there wont be any errors in it.

Data from the real world is much more problematic. Pictures, Video, radar.. all of those need to be processed, they will contain flaws and uncertainties. Since you will introduce flaws and weaknesses when processing input such as video, any follow up algorithm (like driving the car) will be prone to error.

In the games we mentioned, that is not an issue - and STILL it was hard to solve.

&#x200B;

Finally - while the current ML models are supposed to be somewhat close to how our brains work - they really arent even close. That is why our brains are much better in some tasks that require lots of ""intuition"" based on very little data and will be worse in more technical tasks (such as games of chess or Go, which can be beaten by pure computing power due to the simplicity of their underlying structure)"

2021-06-09 15:12:33,wallstreetbets,Trend has been upwards. I bought 5 at 315$ if it tanks I can avg down. Not selling them. I made the mistake and sold 111 shares at 48$ . I'll regret it for years. One thing I've seen about GME is it never goes like they think it will.That's what I like about it.

2021-06-09 15:57:40,wallstreetbets,">Trend has been upwards

This means hardly anything from a realistic standpoint when 99% of all stocks that have existed 5 years ago are upwards trending and so has the market as a whole. Even more worthless when a once in a century event happened that could literally have changed the way the market works for the forseeable future."

2021-06-09 16:08:44,wallstreetbets,"As a short squeeze play, it might work. As an investment,  guess it could also work. I think innovative small to midcap American companies are going to continue flying given the combination of infrastructure spending and speculative investing. Companies that could bring in serious gains include Asensus Surgical (ASXC), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Meatech (MITC), UR Energy (URG), Agrify (AGFY), Vision Marine (VMAR), CNSL, CMLS, EBIX, PKE, RMTI, FSTR, Genie Energy (GNE), GHM, GIFI, JAKK, LFVN, Aemetis (AMTX), ATNI, Audacy (AUD) and BBGI. If you're willing to get even riskier in pursuit of gains, small to midcap innovative Chinese companies such as HUYA, WIMI, ZEPP, DOYU, JKS, JWEL, IFBD, MOMO, BLCT and MKD could also yield great returns."
2021-06-09 18:44:19,wallstreetbets,"A junk company???? They have the third largest production plant in America.  They completely retooled the line for manufacturing, and went above and beyond so most of the truck and their van will be created in house instead of contracting out work.  Think of the money this will save them in the long run not having to worry about shipping large parts of the truck to lordstown for assembly.  EV SEMIS are not right around the corner and the cost of gas and shipping is going to go up.   They spent more money now to make a lot more in the future.  Is their product luxurious?  No.  It’s not meant to be.  Work vehicles will be the majority of EV’s we will see on the road till atleast 10 years from now.  And none of the major manufacturers are going to devote 100% of their time and money to EV’s until Atleast 10 to 15 years from now.  A junk company doesn’t fill 6.2 million square ft with workers."

Even without any funding they produce 1000 truck from September to EOY instead of 2200. Really not that far from eachother....and that's IF they don't get a loan. Which they will"

2021-06-09 16:01:43,wallstreetbets,This stock was heavily shorted when it was traded under $10 bucks and another squeeze is coming
2021-06-09 15:09:15,wallstreetbets,You can set good till cancelled sell orders on Robinhood and Fidelity for options. Saved me on WISH this morning too.
2021-06-09 15:13:29,wallstreetbets,"So on RH if you place the options order after hours, it will execute the next day? Apparently from what I've read fidelity will only do it for that after hours session, then its cancelled."
2021-06-09 15:16:57,wallstreetbets,"You have to set the limit sell order (good till cancelled) before the market closes the previous day, unfortunately, unless there’s a way I don’t know about."
2021-06-09 15:20:38,wallstreetbets,"Basically yeah this is the limitation.
I only trade options on RH because Fidelitys app sucks shit (especially for options).
I'll just have to do this next time, better to put in a limit sell the previous day thats too low and still take profits rather than be bag holding because you fell asleep."

2021-06-09 14:58:27,wallstreetbets,"I've owned NOK since February. I am happy with it as a long play. It's probably the only stock I own with 'good fundamentals'. That said, it underperforms consistently. 

If you look at the trading activity, there is an obvious and regular oscillation of .03c to .05c. 

Just a suspicion, but I think the high-frequency trading does a thing to it's price. Not sure exactly how that would affect the stock, but it's there clear as day.

Ima hodl it."

2021-06-09 15:26:50,wallstreetbets,"Its worth noting that NOK won the Artemis contract in 2020.  Nokia is currently contracted by NASA to build a 4G network on the literal moon as an early-stage setup for sizable human presence by 2028.

While the contract itself isn't a huge inflow, the simple fact that Nokia can be like 'Yeah, we made it so you can have the fucking moon in your contact list' is pretty optimistic.  Even overlooking short term profits, NOK looks like a solid long term play, too.

2021-06-09 17:45:30,wallstreetbets,I know lol im trying to figure out what’s going on
2021-06-09 15:11:12,wallstreetbets,"I think the short-interest portion is the most interesting catalyst, as the lock-up for shares expires June 14th and right now there are 30m in short interest so over 50% of the tradeable float - kudos to that other post on the front page.

But beyond just that gamma squeeze potential - there is actually some real meat to this name.

Here is a copy of a Credit Suisse report I got a hold of which has a $24 target and $44 bull case.

Our price target as a result remains at $24 and we maintain our Outperform rating based on the following thesis points: 1) targeting a large and underserved addressable market earning less than $75,000 in annual income, 2) underpenetrated addressable population across all geographic regions and 3) rising monetization with improved product enhancements.

For the Blue Sky scenario, we use 8.5x 2022E EV/Sales, towards the high end of Wish's high-growth comparables (Etsy, Mercadolibre, Pinduoduo), to arrive at $30.4 billion in enterprise value and ~$32.2 billion in equity value, which is equivalent to ~$44 per share.

2021-06-09 14:58:31,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations! Don’t sell it all though, it can go higher still, way higher. 

Shorts only managed to bring price down 12% after two days with +30% and +85% gains and now it seems they are runnng out of shares to borrow because cost to borrow has skyrocketed to insane 116%

2021-06-09 15:12:10,wallstreetbets,Awesome dude! Congrats!
2021-06-09 15:18:54,wallstreetbets,"It will consolidate, but looking at $30 at the next jump. 👊"
2021-06-09 16:15:22,wallstreetbets,"Regretting the decision this morning to hold. 😬

Someone give me hope....I don’t want to be the bag lady."
2021-06-09 14:44:47,wallstreetbets,"any thoughts on BB. I just bought it and as always it dropped right after. Im not retarded enough to know what to do, so do I hold or sell."
2021-06-09 16:44:34,wallstreetbets,"I got rid of it all at about 26.5, will look to buy back in. After being down so long I just can’t resist 100% gains."
2021-06-09 14:54:43,wallstreetbets,😭😭🤣🤣🤣😭🤣
2021-06-09 15:20:56,wallstreetbets,About a week or so far the 30$ jump or sooner? 🤔
2021-06-09 16:21:38,wallstreetbets,"just hold another week .... it will go up closer to June 18th. 

Not financial advise just good old ape shit :)"

2021-06-09 14:48:33,wallstreetbets,"BB is not a squeeze play. It just gets pumped by bag holders every few months. I bough at 14 during GME and fucking fell to 9. It’s a shit company. And then when you hold for a few weeks you hear shit like “Guys this was never a squeeze” or “Guys, this company has pivoted to tech. All it needs is a car contract.” Its a fucking disease bro. BB stands for Broke Bagholder."
2021-06-09 15:25:16,wallstreetbets,If I knew that I would be smarter than Warren!
2021-06-09 15:26:46,wallstreetbets,I’m averaging down. Have some amc gains from when I paper handed during last weeks little adventure

2021-06-09 15:37:00,wallstreetbets,Damn good one
2021-06-09 17:03:13,wallstreetbets,Question from an uneducated grape: What's the advantage of buying call options in stead of purchasing shares? Is it just that if it tanks you're only out the cost of the option?
2021-06-09 14:58:46,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-09 14:48:44,wallstreetbets,We are ***all*** retarded.
2021-06-09 15:11:15,wallstreetbets,Is $18 the resistance?
2021-06-09 15:11:34,wallstreetbets,"Realistically, what's your end point?"
2021-06-09 15:11:23,wallstreetbets,This

2021-06-09 15:38:10,wallstreetbets,Should be $25+ AH
2021-06-09 16:39:18,wallstreetbets,"Awesome to see your gains on an American Industrial Company. I think small to midcap American industrials are really going to take off because of infrastructure spending and general sentiment. A few examples that I've honed in on include Foster (FSTR), Graham Corp (GHM), Park Aerospace (PKE), Gulf Island Fabrication (GIFI), ATN International (ATNI), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Consolidated Communications (CNSL), and Genie Energy (GNE)."
2021-06-09 15:49:15,wallstreetbets,Hopefully 30+ sooner or later I added 200 more shares on the dip

2021-06-09 15:31:05,wallstreetbets,I'm a poor ape.. but just bought another share.
2021-06-09 14:51:15,wallstreetbets,"$WISH How is this extraordinary run not getting top mention on several stock news sites. I personally don't think many have caught on yet. Tomorrow people will realize more and more what is taking place here. Do not be surprised if we end the day with the watchers list around 100k instead of 19k. This is just getting started, so if you feel as though you are late, no worries.... you are actually on time. As long futures look decent going into PM, expect this to open around $20. I believe there may be one last minor dip on the open before this rockets to anywhere between $30-$40 EOD. It's too hard to predict because FOMO has not even started yet."
2021-06-09 14:47:37,wallstreetbets,"Bought in at $13 today, then jumped in with both feet when it went dipped to $10 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-09 14:55:01,wallstreetbets,"So many reasons to be optimistic! No one can deny that if WISH is successful it's massively undervalued. With the backing of the dumbest investors (who will buy more the more it fails) it's a win-win: Either it does well and the hedge funds get on board, or it does badly and we support it and destroy the shorts!

2021-06-09 15:06:49,wallstreetbets,"I bought $WISH yesterday on a whim but I researched more and its not all positives.  Despite the pandemic increasing online sales and a huge increase in revenue this year, they have not managed to make a profit.  Also so much of the market place is located in China so there are tariff issues and supply line problems due to the lingering effects of the trade war.   


I still think it has a lot of potential to compete in the market space, especially if Amazon is broken up with stronger anti-trust laws potentially on the horizon. It just seems that $WISH's management team is absolute garbage. Hopefully it moons but its not a sure bet by any means."
2021-06-09 19:13:09,wallstreetbets,"Have anyone here actually used wish? It's a marketplace full of cheap chinesium products and scammy sellers, literally nothing there is of good quality, it's all plastic crap. It's basically Alibaba but all the products are cheaper and worse quality."

2021-06-09 16:40:51,wallstreetbets,"You bring up some interesting points. I honestly believe small to midcap American companies with innovation potential are going to see astronomical gains because of the combination of infrastructure spending and speculative investing. Money is going to be racing into these companies before it's too late.

2021-06-09 16:41:46,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! Appreciate the insight, again feel bad this isn’t getting any traction I think the thesis is solid. (But I’m sure I have a bias lol)."
2021-06-09 14:53:16,wallstreetbets,Did you read the post. Fucking nimwit
2021-06-09 14:41:31,wallstreetbets,Wow. You must be a special kind of retard if you were able to loose money beginning your journey just after the Covid crash
2021-06-09 14:47:19,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-09 14:47:56,wallstreetbets,How on earth did you loose money in that time period? Options or what? You could w literally thrown darts at a board and cashed in.
2021-06-09 17:26:06,wallstreetbets,Hellen Keller would have made minimum double the investment in that time frame
2021-06-09 14:39:18,wallstreetbets,So buy more and hold?
2021-06-09 14:39:18,wallstreetbets,Dotn forget today is day they announce the share count also. I’m sure they will announce at closing
2021-06-09 14:50:04,wallstreetbets,And ortex reporting more shares borrowed than expected!!
2021-06-09 14:49:16,wallstreetbets,I mean we’ve been saying this. 🦍🦧
2021-06-09 15:07:18,wallstreetbets,I’m assuming to wake up tomorrow at 9:30 am look at my phone and be rich based on this post alone 💎🤲🏻
2021-06-09 15:08:08,wallstreetbets,It’s so obvious too me that these other plays are distractions to keep people away from the real squeeze over here
2021-06-09 14:40:20,wallstreetbets,could you please explain what this means? my smooth brain don't know graph
2021-06-09 14:42:16,wallstreetbets,"Lol pivot points rarely hold true. If it was that easy everyone would be rich. 
You've only begun with TA. 

Gotta use your head with 1000% more effort."
2021-06-09 14:39:19,wallstreetbets,On June 10 there will be CPI data so I only expect a huge push south
2021-06-09 14:43:33,wallstreetbets,Fuck AMC and it’s bag holders - assholes sabotaged CLOV with Citadel bullshit. I hope AMC crashes and burns.
2021-06-09 14:41:27,wallstreetbets,"I keep adding more at the trendlines 💎🙌🏻. Once it breaks the top trendline we would potentially see 72, then 100, then the sky is the limit after that. By that point they’ll have to cover. This could easily be the next VW of 2008."
2021-06-09 14:43:21,wallstreetbets,Thats what i did 👅 hold and lick it

2021-06-09 15:10:14,wallstreetbets,Especially when the biggest winner at clov was citadel lol it was so obvious what was happening
2021-06-09 14:43:18,wallstreetbets,"Basically, one of the strongest bull flags I’ve seen on a 1hr chart to date. In short, this is an extremely bullish consolidation as it keeps testing the support trendline and not breaking it. Higher lows on the 1hr chart is exactly what we want"
2021-06-09 14:44:59,wallstreetbets,"The bull flag set up on a 1hr and daily chart is one of the strongest bullish indicators. Is it fool proof? Hell no, but the majority of time it works out. Saying rarely is quite an overstatement"
2021-06-09 14:46:53,wallstreetbets,"Damn bro, who hurt you?!"
2021-06-09 14:45:19,wallstreetbets,Lol you mad you got caught in a bull trap at clov? 😂
2021-06-09 14:46:15,wallstreetbets,It’s not our fault you got rug pulled because you think every stock in the whole damn market is a short squeeze.
2021-06-09 18:06:14,wallstreetbets,"Uhhhhh, this isn’t helping your cause. Beyond which have you just started in the stock market or something? Stocks go up, stocks go down. It doesn’t have anything to do with “AMC bag holders”, amc shot a load early in the year then retreated back to $7 for ever, then it blew up to $70. Take a seat, grab your dick and hold."
2021-06-09 14:42:11,wallstreetbets,Love it

2021-06-09 14:45:18,wallstreetbets,"much appreciated, thank you!"
2021-06-09 14:53:38,wallstreetbets,"Majority of the time you'll get yourself caught in false break outs and downs. If your trying to disagree with this it just tells me your inexperienced. 

Pivot points aren't entry or exit points and are extremely simple to spot. 

The market makers are smarter than you and by using beginnier ta skills you'll decimate your account unless you just hold forever. 

Good luck trying to day trade with pivot points."
2021-06-09 14:46:54,wallstreetbets,Nope I’m waaaaay up but the shit that AMC bag holders pulled is below board and totally fucked up. Posting shit about Citadel when Citadel owns more of AMC.

2021-06-09 16:21:49,wallstreetbets,To Mars fellow ape! 🚀
2021-06-09 14:58:43,wallstreetbets,"I never once said this is the ONLY way to trade, however, this is an extremely bullish pattern no matter how you look at it. Majority of the time is a false statement, minority yes. I’ve been trading for roughly 5 years now, I know more than you think I do lol"
2021-06-09 14:52:41,wallstreetbets,"I’d say happy birthday, but your mom should’ve swallowed."
2021-06-09 14:50:00,wallstreetbets,Then why are you whining like a little bitch? Go stick your big gain inside your wife so deep that she leaves her boyfriend and stop complaining.
2021-06-09 16:40:52,wallstreetbets,godspeed
2021-06-09 14:51:54,wallstreetbets,Because I was up 9000% before all the Citadel bullshit lies by what I thought were fellow apes but I guess all that gets tossed aside. Apes get desperate when they buy at the top and scramble.
2021-06-09 14:38:07,wallstreetbets,Best of luck man. I don’t have much money to spare but I’m in with 10 shares. Hoping to see this rocket launch
2021-06-09 14:40:09,wallstreetbets,There's a $1 trillion infrastructure bill in the works. Biden will deliver! American Steel baby!
2021-06-09 14:41:15,wallstreetbets,Wow I jumped out of CLF way too early.
2021-06-09 14:54:59,wallstreetbets,"I put in $45,000 this morning to CLF at $21.20. Missed buying in on Monday under $20 due to funds I put into CLOV and dumped that on a Stop Order at $25 thankfully. Cleveland Cliffs is one of the largest iron ore pellet suppliers for the steel industry. There is a lot of up pressure for this in my plow-boy opinion."

Edit: Just sold. Good luck guys!"
2021-06-09 14:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Wish I would have looked at that earlier but it's at an all time high in 5 years, I'm out."
2021-06-09 14:54:16,wallstreetbets,"jump back in, it’s still early"
2021-06-09 19:22:45,wallstreetbets,Not gonna lie…I hope you are wrong!  Either way at least you exited on your own terms!  I want to exit by handcuffs
2021-06-09 14:44:46,wallstreetbets,It’s not all time high in 5 years yet LMAO! Wait for it to be 35-40$
2021-06-09 14:46:29,wallstreetbets,You do know theres a steel shortage right? Fundamentally this is safe af.
2021-06-09 14:57:04,wallstreetbets,Its got the legs to run up. There's a lot of up pressure for CLF
2021-06-09 15:15:33,wallstreetbets,ATH was close to $125 in 2007
2021-06-09 14:46:09,wallstreetbets,Rh indicates it is in the last 5 years from today.
2021-06-09 14:47:28,wallstreetbets,There's a shortage of nearly everything it's covid. Meanwhile long time large share holders may want to dip out.
2021-06-09 14:58:39,wallstreetbets,I guess I wish I knew more?
2021-06-09 15:23:09,wallstreetbets,Not sure what the 2 stocks have in common?
2021-06-09 14:55:40,wallstreetbets,That means literally absolutely fucking nothing.
2021-06-09 14:46:58,wallstreetbets,I know 🤡 but that’s about to change in a week. The all time high soon going to be 35

2021-06-09 15:53:43,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit dude, CLF all time high is $125."
2021-06-09 19:25:14,wallstreetbets,Lol. I love you . Finally someone that would make me look smart in front of my wife!
2021-06-09 15:54:50,wallstreetbets,No one knows how far it will go. I'm only saying it'll probably dip somewhat before anything else happens.
2021-06-09 19:42:15,wallstreetbets,Ahh yes. Look I just don't buy all time highs. Could it go higher sure. The possibility of long term big share holders pulling out keeps me away.
2021-06-09 14:42:28,wallstreetbets,"Huge upside here. I'm in. Well, I've BEEN in and am still in. Holding 10k shares and multiple calls. Let's. Go! 🎯🎯"

2021-06-09 16:14:42,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, 90% of the time it feels like people saying ""squeeze"" don't even have data to back it up, and probably don't know what it means"

It's a bunch of ""expert"" traders who made some money catching a couple meme stocks exploding since they first got their robinhood account 8 months ago and now think they're fucking market savants. It's the same useless regurgitated buzz words spouted about left and right. Everything is not a squeeze, any  movement against your positions is not market manipulation, your positions are not worth some arbitrarily high number just because you say they are, diamond hands are not the key to making money trading. I'm all for catching hype trades and making a buck on a viral ticker, and I'm even all for exposing reckless overcrowded short positions. But quality has gone to absolute shit over the past several months. I miss quality DD posts where people can actually fucking learn something.

2021-06-09 14:48:02,wallstreetbets,Thanks for saying buy pltr (even sarcastically) enough people will skim this and buy that it should save my position.
2021-06-09 17:06:10,wallstreetbets,Ban the word squeeze and ape from this subreddit
2021-06-09 18:37:10,wallstreetbets,"Man i've been wondering WTF happened to this place,  took a break from options and wsb last year. i come back, not more retards or autists reeeeing or f@ggots delights but everyone talking about being apes? What is that a reference to? I just noticed it's now 10M!!! was 200K when i joined, like x50.  I guess wsb got culturally wiped out by the influx.

And no one getting told to fuck off to /r/investing when talking about buying shares (i;m not talking about selling covered calls).

Anyways i got some ATM CLNE 6-18 calls yesterday afternoon and sold half at open today for a measly 326% profit (it went higher before i sold). while these *shareholders* would have had 40%.

Edit: Shkreli probably wants to stay in jail at this point. The loosers are butthurt and downvoting, it's hilarious."
2021-06-09 17:39:33,wallstreetbets,Thank god. If I have to see one more “DD” focused on a short squeeze because of a “massive short interest” of 3% I’m gonna lose it. That and all the “let’s screw the hedge funds” madness.
2021-06-09 14:36:10,wallstreetbets,Would just use another word for squeeze.
2021-06-09 18:32:53,wallstreetbets,"Can we also limit anyone who says moon, mooon, moooon or moooooooon to one post a day.  Fuck it can they just be outright banned.

But, right or wrong, the returns some of the stocks have done recently is amazing. So something is right even when it looks broken."

2021-06-09 16:24:53,wallstreetbets,Gamma sqoize
2021-06-09 15:55:14,wallstreetbets,so... short squeeze on PLTR?
2021-06-09 19:55:08,wallstreetbets,"People will just find a way to say ""squeeze"" without typing it out then will accuse the mods of censorship and being Citadel bots.

The amounts of actually retarded idiots here is far to high for this to have any positive effect."
2021-06-09 16:19:12,wallstreetbets,I don't think it would work. The term ape came from the influx of noobs to the sub and some didn't like the word retard. I got temp banned 3 different times in early February for using the word retard. Banning squeeze will just insert a new phrase.
2021-06-09 15:29:04,wallstreetbets,due diligence has recently consisted of going on finviz and sorting by short interest. would be down to see this end.
2021-06-09 16:01:49,wallstreetbets,But then when’s the squoze?

2021-06-09 16:39:22,wallstreetbets,Fully agree. It takes me 1 hour to filter through all the noob noise these days to make money instead of just 15 mins a day 6 months ago for roughly similar gains. This is extremely time wasting
2021-06-09 15:01:24,wallstreetbets,fucking so down for this but you know damn well its not gonna happen because some hedge funds have some mods in their pockets. I might even get banned for this comment.
2021-06-09 17:06:02,wallstreetbets,"Agreed big time! The moderators should take a tangible action as soon as possible to remove these mostly false “squeeze” and “yolo” claims as the less resources the apes will have at the end of the day, the less appetite they will have to return to the market. I am aware that they might be in favor of lack of regulation, but those posts are nothing but false flags. Other than that, people will still have the liberty to invest their money however they want."
2021-06-09 16:25:49,wallstreetbets,"Let's try it.

I don't believe short squeezes would happen - it is just another technique to hype a stock. Remember when the short interest on GME was high? Then GME placed off market a big chunk of stock, I believe at $250. This is just my speculation, but what if this stock was loaned to Melvin at an interest rate that is less then Melvin would have to pay in the open market in return for favors? (from our vantage point, we don't know what deals are made behind closed doors)"

2021-06-09 16:05:34,wallstreetbets,You still read those posts? You don’t remember SLV bros and what happened with that? Loud minority yelling loud and then exiting their shit positions in a sideways Andy stock.
2021-06-09 16:29:37,wallstreetbets,Where do I buy puts on this?
2021-06-09 16:34:30,wallstreetbets,Petitions almost always work out so lets do it.
2021-06-09 16:35:59,wallstreetbets,Short squish.
2021-06-09 16:36:27,wallstreetbets,"It is from hedgefunds pretending to be retail, what did you expect?

Edit: besides banning the word squeeze we should als ban short interest"
2021-06-09 16:43:26,wallstreetbets,Quality all time low and volume all time high….
2021-06-09 16:48:22,wallstreetbets,seconded as well
2021-06-09 16:48:49,wallstreetbets,All I saw was squeeze and spce :)
2021-06-09 16:58:24,wallstreetbets,Please god yes
2021-06-09 17:01:49,wallstreetbets,Might have to ban the short too.. lol
2021-06-09 17:02:38,wallstreetbets,You know there’ll be an alternative word like juiced
2021-06-09 17:03:03,wallstreetbets,i concur
2021-06-09 17:06:31,wallstreetbets,Gotta add shorts and short interest to that list.
2021-06-09 17:07:53,wallstreetbets,FUCKIN EH!
2021-06-09 17:09:12,wallstreetbets,"Lets start calling it a ""Bear Hug"" 😁"
2021-06-09 17:09:14,wallstreetbets,Lately?  Or since January?

302nd this."

2021-06-09 17:13:03,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Just pump and dump posts
2021-06-09 17:13:58,wallstreetbets,That makes perfect sense to me
2021-06-09 17:14:38,wallstreetbets,And any screenshot or mention of Robinhood.
2021-06-09 17:16:23,wallstreetbets,please god that would be awesome.
2021-06-09 17:18:03,wallstreetbets,We just need to switch to “ firmly grasp it “
2021-06-09 17:18:41,wallstreetbets,But there are [long squeezes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_squeeze) too.
2021-06-09 17:18:42,wallstreetbets,This will surely work for at least 10 minutes
2021-06-09 17:26:44,wallstreetbets,Please oh please oh please!!!
2021-06-09 17:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes, start baning words. Always works out great for everyone involved."
2021-06-09 17:29:00,wallstreetbets,"""Buy PLTR shares, short squeeze incoming""

This is the only thing I read. All in on PLTR"
2021-06-09 17:31:27,wallstreetbets,"DD makes no difference other than simple understanding of share structure, that is literally all.
Get enough retards slap shares and options and it will go up, its as simple as that. No need to pretend stuff that doesn’t even matter, unless you’re investing and not trading."
2021-06-09 17:32:07,wallstreetbets,"DD doesn't matter anymore, just follow the pump and sell before the dump"
2021-06-09 17:32:49,wallstreetbets,No DD anymore haha
2021-06-09 17:36:06,wallstreetbets,"I feel like the word DD should also be banned for a while. Everything is fucking DD now. 

Your balls itching isn't DD."

2021-06-09 17:39:47,wallstreetbets,Here here
2021-06-09 17:41:09,wallstreetbets,Can’t we just make up another retard term for squeeze
2021-06-09 17:43:56,wallstreetbets,Ban short too. Tired of short interest being the one and only thing the majority of DD focuses on lately.
2021-06-09 17:45:40,wallstreetbets,Please add the phrase “short interest” in general for the love of god.
2021-06-09 17:45:44,wallstreetbets,Please add the phrase “short interest” in general for the love of god
2021-06-09 17:46:19,wallstreetbets,And squooze

Most of the posts I see are random people throwing 100k at something and throwing a bunch of rockets and moons on it when they post it.  


It would be nice to see actual discussions."
2021-06-09 17:50:36,wallstreetbets,"I wholeheartedly agree, until someone wants to discuss a potential gamma squeeze."
2021-06-09 17:53:11,wallstreetbets,Please
2021-06-09 17:53:44,wallstreetbets,but then people will use even sillier words like squoze
2021-06-09 17:53:57,wallstreetbets,"MOASS! I’ve heard that so many times, still waiting though…"
2021-06-09 17:54:04,wallstreetbets,Ban everybody who has subbed in 2021. This sub isn't what it used to be.

2021-06-09 17:57:10,wallstreetbets,Just let the squeeze happen first before banning the word please and thank you
2021-06-09 17:58:53,wallstreetbets,So.. um... what's the next SNEEZE play?
2021-06-09 17:59:10,wallstreetbets,Your exactly right. I've been thinking this for the past month. Shorties are trying to make ends meet by fooling retards into bagholding the stocks they are heavily invested in
2021-06-09 18:00:22,wallstreetbets,Ban it forever
2021-06-09 18:00:27,wallstreetbets,Insert synonym

2021-06-09 18:25:17,wallstreetbets,So is squozzling off the table?
2021-06-09 18:28:56,wallstreetbets,Yea let's call it a squish instead!
2021-06-09 18:29:18,wallstreetbets,Pump and dump is illegal and accounts susoected to engage in this should be investigated and reported
2021-06-09 18:30:15,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-09 18:31:17,wallstreetbets,But if they are already on here. Won't they see this post and just dig through our posts more thoroughly?
2021-06-09 18:31:17,wallstreetbets,What DD. I havent seen good DD here since I lost all my money speculating on which tanker company was forcing it's executives to fill their swimming pools with sweet crude.
2021-06-09 18:32:28,wallstreetbets,DD has been horrible since Jan. Got better and is back to trash with people giving wrong numbers and trying to “squeeze” stocks that make no sense
2021-06-09 18:35:57,wallstreetbets,They will just say moonmm
2021-06-09 18:36:05,wallstreetbets,Retard says what?
2021-06-09 18:38:26,wallstreetbets,"remove the words 

ape 

moon

evil shorts

2021-06-09 18:39:45,wallstreetbets,One short smush coming right up.
2021-06-09 18:40:41,wallstreetbets,Please ban this post because it includes the word squeeze.
2021-06-09 18:40:41,wallstreetbets,"Today a ""DD"" on CPSH showed up on multiple pages, the only information besides basically calling upon wall street bets to come save it was they have a sales team member.  you guys are officially being called to dig out every bag holder since February"

2021-06-09 18:41:27,wallstreetbets,Yes let’s temporarily ban this word. This post will then make the news as it effects the overall market
2021-06-09 18:43:05,wallstreetbets,"The only thing that will stop this is banning new accounts from posting or commenting

everything else is a nothingburger"
2021-06-09 18:44:58,wallstreetbets,So buy PLTR?
2021-06-09 18:46:36,wallstreetbets,Won't need to in a month. It will happen by then.

2021-06-09 18:49:23,wallstreetbets,Are we going to have a code word for squeeze then?
2021-06-09 18:49:33,wallstreetbets,This sub is a steamy pile of 💩now
2021-06-09 18:49:44,wallstreetbets,Please also squooze and squoozed.
2021-06-09 18:50:10,wallstreetbets,Definitely should be.. Cause we’re causing most of the positive volume & negative volume! The people following the moves we post play what we tag for the day and set amount of gains up & down heavily! Like Half Retards 🔥
2021-06-09 18:50:51,wallstreetbets,The truth is wsb mods are deleting posts with proper DD.  Recently I saw a BNGO dd which was really interesting.  I came back to the post to find it deleted.
2021-06-09 18:52:31,wallstreetbets,"Whats this, r/investing?

Anyways, there is this company that is branching out to ecommerce and expanding into to esports area (esports is like 200b market right now) and great leadership coming from Amazon mostly. Great future yknow. Also they are dabbling with creep toe currency. All of that on top of reopening after the pandemic. I guess this company will control the gaming sector, be like the amazon for gaming."
2021-06-09 18:52:54,wallstreetbets,"maybe mention the stocks that actually involve illegal conduct

and yes i’m looking at you clov"
2021-06-09 18:53:23,wallstreetbets,What does DD mean?
2021-06-09 18:53:25,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
2021-06-09 18:54:02,wallstreetbets,What if DD is on lemon futures and we are talking about making lemonade?
2021-06-09 18:54:54,wallstreetbets,I thought this sub wasn’t about quality DD though. Super confused at this point. What even is WSB anymore?
2021-06-09 18:55:26,wallstreetbets,I’ll retard that
2021-06-09 18:55:30,wallstreetbets,"Squeeze, as in the illustrious $WKHS Workhorse squeeze that' the mother of all squeezes.  I think we should wait for that to play out first, agreed"
2021-06-09 18:55:39,wallstreetbets,I agree
2021-06-09 18:55:41,wallstreetbets,"I've been pounding the table for months saying that you really need low float in shares for a short squeeze to work.  These apes just Google high short interest and pick the top ticker without understanding the mechanics of a squeeze, that is a liquidity driven bubble with a need for people to buy (the shorts) and a catalyst."
2021-06-09 18:55:41,wallstreetbets,this meme stonk is ready for big Orange Juice
2021-06-09 18:55:46,wallstreetbets,Swear every ticker is a squeeze atm

This company is 10x stronger and has a higher future than most of the stocks y’all been pumping on here. Most of the real SPCE investors from the start want organic growth. With or without WSB, this is going high. Don’t hate on SPCE just because you apes think everything is going to short squeeze, and now it’s taking away from AMC or GME. We didn’t want to be associated with y’all anyways lol. Stay in your lane."

2021-06-09 19:16:14,wallstreetbets,But how am I supposed to squeeze my tendies while reeling heux when they see my moon lambo
2021-06-09 19:17:18,wallstreetbets,Agreed!
2021-06-09 19:17:59,wallstreetbets,"I don't know. The perception of a squeeze is important for driving some of these prices up. I mean, MSNBC fucktards are all reporting on the squeezes and that drives price action.

Maybe instead of ""sqoze"" we can just refer to it as ""price discovery"" like the hedge funds and MMs do. (Price discovery is my favorite, ambiguous, catch-all term)."

2021-06-09 19:25:11,wallstreetbets,"Retarded means slow and isn't always referring to mental state or capability. Brain fog has been used a lot to describe one of the effects covid has on long haulers, like me. Brain fog is basically a slowing down of mental processing and/or a memory recall impairment. Retard means late in French, so I presume it should be acceptable to utter at a university, sans the politically correct so-called cancel culture of real or imagined (dragons) mock indignation expressed by some people. I prefer clasping, grasping, embracing or clamping to the s word, which I mainly (pun intended) reserve for special occasions. To the moon!"

2021-06-09 19:39:55,wallstreetbets,"Please have a bot just delete everything with the word squeeze, and DD posts should require some actual proof of statements. Can’t believe how much, Trust me X is happening, or its X shorted or w/e but there’s zero proof of anything. All sounds like snake oil if you cant prove your statements. Half the times I think their just regurgitating what they’ve heard and they got no idea if the guy’s comment they got it from is even true."

Actually fuck it lets only go with articles from CNBC because they go through the editorial process. At least that way whatever fucking idiotic metric you use to measure who does and does not deserve a platform will definitely work.

2021-06-09 19:59:01,wallstreetbets,"This or something like this. I feel that part of the retail revolution and our greater access to data than ever, is our ability to create a short squeeze situation. This is literally us changing the rules.

I'm just squozing."

Thanks for looking into this.  Don't know how you could accomplish it, but I have faith the mod squad will figure something out."
2021-06-09 17:38:49,wallstreetbets,Can you just ban the word short? I’m tired of being reminded I’m not just mentally challenged but also vertically challenged while here
2021-06-09 19:16:08,wallstreetbets,"Hey folks and u/zjz. I wrote the EndGame DD series on GME. These rules sound great in isolation, but all they do is make it harder to actually publish good DD.  
  
Most of my DD was pretty long - over 10 pages in Google Docs before I posted them to wsb. Almost every time, the post was deleted by some automod rule, and more often than not, I did not know what rules I was breaking.  
  
Also, there were several times that not only was the post deleted, I was banned and/or muted from WSB for several days at a time. Meaning several of my posts took multiple days to get onto WSB, and by then some of them were outdated.  
  
The longer / more thorough the DD, the greater the probability it hits one of the now many automod rules. This honestly is frustrating and discouraging as someone who likes to conduct and then share thorough research. It ends up not being worth it."
2021-06-09 19:35:10,wallstreetbets,"Ban anyone who says ""ape"" or uses a rocket emoji."

2021-06-09 19:54:07,wallstreetbets,Also when did Autist turn into Ape & positions or ban stop being a thing? I feel like a confused old man
2021-06-09 19:44:03,wallstreetbets,"I think the real problem is wallstreetbets went from one or two million followers to 10 million followers in three months. Money brings greed, greed brings people. A lot of people see this as a super fast buck. Unfortunately I am guilty of the same. I have been on Reddit for years (7 or 8 or something) and would stop by this sub randomly because it interested me, yet once the meme stock hit the first time I was like ok, maybe I need to pay attention. And so I have. 

Point is, you can’t get 8 million new people wanting to say their piece without diluting the product that those 8 million people got interested in. An interesting conundrum. And until the money that can be made daily from here leaves, I don’t think you are going to get rid of the dilution of this subreddit. Just my personal thoughts. 

Look! No retard, ape strong, or rocket ships, so I’m sure this post will go nowhere lol. Again just a thought."

Find some tickers that correlate, make your trade.

Im looking at PGE (supplies water/hydro energy), Tejorn ranch (exporter/grower of a lot of CA Agg.), and then theres desalination, and agg. irrigation companies.

Maybe that's easy to say after-the-fact though. My question is who's buying? If scrapers are the ones losing out, they deserve it, but I just think it's wrong to lure new investors into a stock with the expectation that it will be the next GME, or the next AMC.

2021-06-09 19:33:46,wallstreetbets,"Do you know how much DD has been done over GME pandering to the masses of the squeeze being about to hit since January? More than I truly ever want to have to count up. I'm sure the same for AMC, CLOV, BB and the other meme stocks, bc they know that's the trigger word for people to buy them without caring at all about fundamentals. Still waiting on that MOASS for GME I've been reading about since January.


 Full disclosure: have sold all my positions in GME after making money back in January and rebuy/sell here and there as a result of you apes to make more money. Your theories don't pan out aside from making it a very volatile stock for swing trading or, at the very least, needs to be acknowledged that this could be a very long term investment to get to the vaunted MOASS and that it's not going to happen in a month or less."
2021-06-09 19:50:47,wallstreetbets,"So, I guess I was under the misimpression that the whole thing with these meme stocks is that DD makes them looks like a poor investment, and yet there are some folks who ignore this and invest anyway.  And sometimes end up making a bunch of money.  I mean, I'm fairly certain this is why they become heavily shorted in the first place.  It seems somewhat odd to me to hear someone complaining about DD in these cases."

2021-06-09 16:43:08,wallstreetbets,"It’s almost like there’s a mass of people who unthinkingly dump money into anything with moderate+ short interest without any regard to fundamentals, and then call the resulting increase in price a short squeeze. Self-fulfilling (and perpetuating) prophecy at its finest. 

Look at $RIDE, for fucks sake. They just publicly announced that they don’t have the money to do what they’re supposed to do as a business, and are at risk of eventually not being a business. Very understandably, stock dropped to $9. Aaaaaand then shot up to almost $13 within the day because other people on the internet say the squeeze hasn’t been squoze or whatever. 

Are there shorted companies out there with good fundamentals? Yes (see: CLF). Does that mean every one of them should be “squeezed,” or that any positive price action must be a short squeeze? No.

I’m not saying there’s not money to be made off of the mania, but I think OP is correct that this sub and its trading patterns have become so formulaic as to become an easy manipulation tool. I’m not sure banning the word “squeeze” would actually do much in the long run, other than maybe clean up the feed a notch and force creative alternatives, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a valid point."

2021-06-09 18:18:19,wallstreetbets,Well that's kind of retarded.
2021-06-09 17:58:06,wallstreetbets,"yep, people take proper words for a thing they have a low opinion of and use them as insults. as the insult becomes common, academics turn to newer words with less negative connotation, and the cycle continues"

Yes.. and they are about the same meme stocks from wsb, usually posted by someone active in wsb.  I understand why people are annoyed at the term being thrown around to artificially manufacture excitement, but don't really care if the term is banned or not."
2021-06-09 18:13:47,wallstreetbets,"you are correct. The mods had pinned a post shortly after GME took off the first time and random people were piling into the sub.

2021-06-09 17:02:20,wallstreetbets,"The people who lose money care, presumably. 

Take a look at volume profiles on a 10 or 20 day chart for all the recent “short squeeze” memes and tell me what you see.

I’ll tell you what I see: a sizable mass of volume above current prices. That’s bound to happen — someone’s gotta buy to get it to the tippy-top — but I’m betting that mass of volume is mostly people who got in after seeing a “short squeeze imminent!” post on this sub, and I’m betting they’re not stoked on the money they’re losing. 

Like I said, there’s clearly BIG money to be made, IF you’re among the first to get in, and there’s some money to be made if you’re quick to slide into the pump and the first to get out before the dump. But I’d wager that the ones who are making the most money off of this are the ones who’ve been in these positions long before posting about squeezes and shit on WSB, and I’m guessing that folks here would be disappointed to find out the percentage of those early-adopters who are not retail investors. 

Again, the problem isn’t that there’s money to be made. The problem is that this sub has become an easily manipulable mover of the meme market — this was OP’s point."

I lurk for ideas about where I can scalp some profits on a pump and for the occasional good meme.

2021-06-09 14:25:12,wallstreetbets,"So, does this mean shortsellers are paying 116% annual interest on their borrowed shares?"
2021-06-09 14:30:41,wallstreetbets,"Also should be noted that Russell inclusion happens June 25th at this point. When June 25th comes, its the largest trading day of the year and EFTs and funds have to buy shares at whatever price to reach the quota needed. This adds long term stability to stocks but also will have a huge influx on buys that will burn any shorts more. Keep the pressure on as its only a matter of time 🚀🚀"

2021-06-09 15:04:40,wallstreetbets,So what does this mean?  They're trying to lower it so they pay less interest?

2021-06-09 17:34:10,wallstreetbets,"If you add up the number of shares shorted today alone you get about 2.4mil on a 367mil volume day. THATS NOTHING. If you really think the hedges didn’t jump onto a sinking ship for quick profit, that is they saw the top shorted it and got out before the bell closed, you’re crazy. This is not going to cause a major increase in SI. 

Now correct me if I’m wrong but once you’re short a stock the lender can’t raise your interest rate so previous shorts aren’t going to feel the pressure to sell, well because the interest is only 4%. Would love a link to say whether this is the case."
2021-06-09 18:58:51,wallstreetbets,Someone explain why a high borrow fee matters in this situation literally like I’m 5 years old
2021-06-09 19:22:00,wallstreetbets,AMC goes down 7% and 3 million people in WSB come here like “FUCK CLOV YOURE TAKING MONEY OUT OF OUR GOD TIER AMC YOLO FUCK CLOV FUCK CLOV FUCK CLOV” like a bunch of true selfish degenerates. BE HAPPY FOR YOUR FELLOW APES!

2021-06-09 14:27:00,wallstreetbets,What’s wrong with shorting a stock at $27 that was $9 a week prior?
2021-06-09 14:31:28,wallstreetbets,[deleted]

2021-06-09 14:26:52,wallstreetbets,"Yes for the shares they are borrowing TODAY, its up from only 4.5% yesterday. The last time this happened GME and AMC went to the moon 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀"
2021-06-09 14:28:16,wallstreetbets,Correct and that changes all the time. The more pressure the higher it will go and they will have to cover at some point as they will most likely be margin called.
2021-06-09 14:26:51,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-09 14:27:03,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-09 17:35:49,wallstreetbets,Yes so they saw the top got in shorted it and then bought back in at the bottom. No one will hold something that has 100%+ interest. And previous shorts from today are only 4%.
2021-06-09 14:41:07,wallstreetbets,Why can they not buy before June 25th when they can see price is less than what they might expect on 25th?
2021-06-09 14:49:11,wallstreetbets,Had to make a post about it after seeing all the BS apes were spewing about CLOV. Seems like AMCtards are butthurt that it didn't moon more so they want to trash CLOV. I missed out on AMC myself don't see me whining about it
2021-06-09 14:36:43,wallstreetbets,Man said Bis 👌🏽☘️
2021-06-09 14:29:41,wallstreetbets,"Exactly bro, I got positions in GME, BB, WKHS, CLNE and UWMC too still had to pick up some CLOV but apes wanna hate lmao 🍀🌖🚀"
2021-06-09 18:11:57,wallstreetbets,wish everyone had your attitude - amazing at the end of trading the amount AMC clowns in the chat rooms bashing CLOV and telling everyone to flee - one asshole even said he was buying shorts - mind your own fcking business people - its a shame too because a lot of small money guys bailed with a loss and wont be able to reach that gold pot - (if it truly happens) - cheers
2021-06-09 14:37:15,wallstreetbets,"I bought CLOV months ago. I set a limit sell for $23 last night and my app sold it at the peak, $28. 😂😂😂 fuck CLOVE!!!"
2021-06-09 14:44:21,wallstreetbets,Riding this one with you 8/20
2021-06-09 15:08:55,wallstreetbets,It means when the price spiked it became higher than what they originally borrowed shares at. So to make money they had to bring the price down by opening new short positions at these higher prices and selling those shares short again. There aren't shares available to borrow because they doubled down on there short sales by opening new short positions which is why the borrow rate skyrocketed.
2021-06-09 18:15:24,wallstreetbets,in order to rent or borrow a short stock there is a borrow fee - typically it isnt much - a few points - but if the shorts are hard to come by then the price increases - so today the hedgies were paying 116-119% to borrow shorts against ClOV - i think the magic number was below 17$ and we almost had them but hence the naysayers fled and i think the CPI coming out tomorrow scared buyers off - Now I dont know if that below 17 was legit or not - in fact how does anyone know? But I do know the borrow fee at that rate is high and rare - it was that high during GME and AMC prior to taking off -
2021-06-09 14:37:09,wallstreetbets,"Over 900k options are already ITM for the June 18th expiry date, they just added all the strikes over 20 dollars yesterday. Seems primed for a squeeze to me"
2021-06-09 16:58:50,wallstreetbets,that makes it easier to squeeze because large institutions don't get caught up in day trading. further confirms belief in thesis of the company for future success. thanks for the FUD though.
2021-06-09 14:35:38,wallstreetbets,Lol Ford is not at 227%
2021-06-09 18:19:53,wallstreetbets,ford is right where she belongs - $15 - been there forever
2021-06-09 14:28:19,wallstreetbets,"If there was shares available to short, it wouldn't be over 100% interest. This reeks of naked shorting just like with AMC and GME."
2021-06-09 17:54:09,wallstreetbets,"He’s also not taking into account that only 2.4mil shares were shorted on a 367mil volume day. This didn’t cause the massive correction. Additionally nothing stopped the people shorting today, with 100% interest, to have closed before the bell. No one holds shorts with 100% interest. This post will lead people to hold losing profits or go drastically red. Took my profits at just above 20. Take profits and move on."
2021-06-09 15:27:46,wallstreetbets,Use that same logic on GME and AMC... yeah no.
2021-06-09 14:32:47,wallstreetbets,"Buddy citadel is a market maker, they own shares of GME and AMC too. Be a retard not retarded smh"
2021-06-09 14:56:39,wallstreetbets,Looks like it’s stuck around $20
2021-06-09 15:04:31,wallstreetbets,"Ok, let me get my diamond ball"
2021-06-09 14:36:04,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I’m in"
2021-06-09 14:34:55,wallstreetbets,Or they just continue to short and drive price down until we lose interest
2021-06-09 17:37:59,wallstreetbets,"Interest doesn’t change on shorts currently shorted. The people shorting before today are 4.5% or less, most probably less. Additionally no one holds if something has >100% interest."
2021-06-09 14:57:50,wallstreetbets,I think they can buy it til June 25th so at any point til then they gotta buy and will still inflate it.
2021-06-09 15:05:17,wallstreetbets,So I should hold then? I was close to selling when it was $28 a share
2021-06-09 14:50:43,wallstreetbets,Fuck You and Congrats
2021-06-09 17:41:35,wallstreetbets,"So approximately 2.4mil traded short today on a 367mil volume day caused this to tank 25%? People took profits. You’re gonna get a lot of people burned. Those shorting likely bought back their shorted sales before the closing bell, no one holds with interest >100%"
2021-06-09 14:38:10,wallstreetbets,https://iborrowdesk.com/report/F.MM doesnt this show that??
2021-06-09 14:32:39,wallstreetbets,Soooo you’re just speculating?
2021-06-09 17:58:05,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. People coming after me bc I’m congratulating those that took profits, providing advice to those that bag hold, and tell people who are still pushing CLOV to stop making more bag holders for their own gain."
2021-06-09 15:32:36,wallstreetbets,If you shorted amc at $70 and covered at $45 you’re sitting pretty rn sooo. Nothing wrong with shorting. I agree amc and GME got some suspicious activity. But CLOV?
2021-06-09 15:01:59,wallstreetbets,I wish
2021-06-09 14:43:43,wallstreetbets,Lmao. Sniffing Joe Biden is here and buying meme stocks 😂
2021-06-09 18:16:03,wallstreetbets,"Actually that’s untrue. If you’re holding a short position, the current borrow rate still applies to you. In fact you’ll get a letter from the lender stating that the cost to continue borrowing the stonk has gone up."
2021-06-09 15:16:30,wallstreetbets,"Yes, hold and I would suggest not looking at the price for a couple days. I suspect that to might get ugly, possibly until the 25th, that is when CLOV gets added to the russel Index and ETF’s and Index’s have to buy a bunch of shares at any price. That is when we will see the squeeze at the latest IMO"
2021-06-09 18:22:37,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at 21 and gave no fucks when the price went to 28 today.

Maybe it’s retarded, but it’s the retardation that wins. What am I going to do? Try to predict every 3 minute spike the next two weeks?


Stocks can just as easily move out of your sell price after and then what?

Should also mention I give no fucks it went down to 16. It can go down to 5 tomorrow and it’s still not dead money."
2021-06-09 18:42:02,wallstreetbets,"You are arguing with people that have an agenda.

People start quoting 100% borrow fees as if there's only one reason why that can happen.

AMC went from 5% to 85% borrow fee and the price kept dropping, then it mooned with the borrow being 6%. People read too much into things because of ignorance. But sure, everyone is free to trust a stranger with their life savings. 

Anyone checked when clov lock up expires? I wouldn't be surprised if it's next week, hence the sudden pump in the last 3 days."
2021-06-09 19:28:27,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure some people sold buddy, never said nobody sold. This doesn't mean that folks with short positions didn't double down which is what the high borrow rate indicates. Also of course they can hold it, its 100 percent interest per YEAR. A couple of days may not make a difference with what you stand to make..  


You're saying I'm gonna get a lot of people burned for replying to this guys question? lmao"
2021-06-09 14:41:00,wallstreetbets,https://iborrowdesk.com/report/F
2021-06-09 14:35:16,wallstreetbets,Your question is the same as asking what's wrong with shorting GME and AMC because they used to be at $5 and $3 respectively. The borrow rate wouldn't be high if there was a ton of shares available to borrow lol.
2021-06-09 18:07:34,wallstreetbets,It should be mandatory for people to show their positions with posts like this.
2021-06-09 15:34:02,wallstreetbets,That’s easy to saw because you see the results but you would be dumb to short any meme stock currently
2021-06-09 15:38:51,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah.  Bummer.  Oh well
2021-06-09 18:46:23,wallstreetbets,No. That is absolutely false. Your borrow rate is set at what it was when you took a short position. You’re welcome to provide a link to provide otherwise.  It if you can’t see the legal implications and the conflict of interest to change someone’s interest rate you most definitely belong here.
2021-06-09 15:23:15,wallstreetbets,So more dips and more buys before 25th?
2021-06-09 18:48:00,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, but trying to inform as many audiences as possible. I’d hate to see people get fucked and hate seeing people trying to take advantage of them when a golden goose has already been cooked."
2021-06-09 19:26:45,wallstreetbets,"Yea because it moons after the shorts cover... hence the borrow rate goes down when the actual moon happens because shorts are covering. The high borrow fee is an indicator of what's to come, you would expect it to be going down while the borrow rate is high just like with AMC and GME. Why don't you use your brain instead of claiming others have an agenda?"
2021-06-09 19:29:25,wallstreetbets,Tell me once where I said that this was the sole cause of the tank in price? I simply highlighted what high borrow fee indicates
2021-06-09 14:41:43,wallstreetbets,Oops. My bad
2021-06-09 14:37:26,wallstreetbets,No it’s not. I understand that CLOV being short before was it getting beat down. But now? It makes sense. Why would you not short a stock that ran 100% on hype when it was worth less than $10 before. This is coming from someone that bought calls.

2021-06-09 15:38:01,wallstreetbets,I agree with you on that one! Lol that’s why I got CLOV puts. I’m bullish amc though

You're now being charged a stock borrow fee to maintain a short position(s).		

Your short position(s) in the security(ies) shown below has been classified as hard-to-borrow. As a result, as of 07/23/2020 we began charging a daily stock borrow fee to maintain the position. We'll attempt to notify you if the security's classification changes to easy-to-borrow. 

Please note that stock borrow fees for a short position can change daily as a result of changes in the price of the security and the availability of its shares in the securities lending market.

Borrow rates are subject to change without prior notice. Rates on borrowed securities are subject to change based on the supply of and demand for the security in the market. Generally speaking, the higher the demand to short the underlying security, the higher the fee or rate to borrow the shares.”

2021-06-09 19:35:31,wallstreetbets,"“To make money they had to bring the price down by taking out new short positions” you implied this is why the price ranked. Instead of analytics saw a slowing and peaking for a meme bubble, look at all the other stocks since GME, and decided to grab some tendies. Sure “buddy” you’re doing great stuff."
2021-06-09 17:43:07,wallstreetbets,You are the combo breaker of usual WSB. Most people here will just double down for reasons.
2021-06-09 14:42:00,wallstreetbets,"So you think its straight to continuously short, even to the point of naked shorting just because something ran on hype and you're in a losing position? CLOV isn't a scam or a fake business which is what shorting is for in the first place lol. That means its fine to short GME and AMC just cuz they went up on hype?"
2021-06-09 19:36:41,wallstreetbets,"and I have 200 shares @ 12.20 and some calls, I sold my other 200 @ 23"
2021-06-09 14:47:27,wallstreetbets,"You do not know it’s naked shorting. You can sniff for clues but there will never be concrete evidence. You are speculating and encouraging others to buy based on your theory. Naked shorting is illegal. That’s a fact. You can’t 100% prove it’s happening here. So why continue to bring it up. Also to your last point, yes. If someone shorted amc at $70 and covered in the $40s that’s great for them. They made money. Which is the whole point of the market. You keep assuming all shorts started their positions earlier and that’s wrong. Shorts are not some centralized group. Retail investors can also be shorts."
2021-06-09 14:55:16,wallstreetbets,"Yea, there is some speculation on my part I agree. I never encouraged anyone to buy in my post I simply addressed all of the CLOV bashing that was going on in the sub. Read the post never once did I say to buy, only that CLOV had the potential to move like GME and AMC did. I said that example about GME and AMC shorting in the sense that they had been naked shorted. That was proven with GME because there were more shareholder votes than shares. If you want concrete evidence of naked shorting then no I cant give that to you, but I can say that I haven't seen borrow rates of over 100% besides with GME which was naked shorted. And yes I know and agree with you that shorts aren't a centralized group, when I say shorts I mean those who have a short position be it retail investor or HF. I wrote HF in the post because apes don't understand that concept and this is WSB retard."
2021-06-09 17:43:24,wallstreetbets,Mvis had 129% fee borrow.. its done it 2 times now. Would've been 3 if weekly options werent put into play. Wsbbetter. Im a noob but have come to understand how things work over time. I get burned sometimes. Sometimes i don't. Here i am hesitant to go jumo into clov with high premiums. Is it worth waiting a day or are they going to return znd forced to cover. How long csn they bury this in weekly option plays to mitigate losses and drag it out. I am asking for your case of buying calls tomorrow for a 2 week exp vs waiting a day and buying option further out to cover FTDs and settlements.
2021-06-09 15:00:49,wallstreetbets,I think we have came to a consensus lol I agree you didn’t explicitly tell ppl to buy but it definitely increases FOMO in some ppl who cant make decisions for themselves
2021-06-09 17:45:16,wallstreetbets,I sold 2 8/20 $15 calls at $22.xx still have 1 call left no shares. Why should apes go balls deep tomorrow at open vs waiting a day.

2021-06-09 17:51:49,wallstreetbets,"I bought at limit $18 this morning. In my opinion, CLOV is definitely an excellent buy...I'm in the medical field and totally understand about Medicare Advantage and how it works. Medicare patients provides the physicians office the most reimbursement compared to HMO Medicaid. Clover Health uses software programs for clinical use, medical providers and to save the government money (most importantly tax payers money; look at your pay stubs and check how much they're deducting from your salary for Medicare tax). Now, Clover Health will have medical providers to actually do home visits with the seniors at home. How convenient is that!!  Overall, I will buy more CLOV tomorrow!"

2021-06-09 16:57:36,wallstreetbets,also i gotta control my emotions with 200%\~600% swings. its so freaking hard to do XD

2021-06-09 18:01:41,wallstreetbets,"CLOV and attached companies and investors  are under DOJ investigations. CLOV is a trap stock IMO.  The underlying business model is garbage and profits will never moonshot because its funded completely by government funds, the software they claim to be pioneering is fraught with issues and per the doctors who have used it ""sucks"", they have had extensive turn over in their executive ranks, the billionaire who brought the company public may have broken the law doing so  there's all kind of sketchy shit going on with it, and there are a bunch more reasons that I would never call this a long play. Namely the executives in charge of it being responsible for price gouging.

2021-06-09 16:59:14,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. We all knew by this point having seen what happened with GME & AMC & the downward pressure applied by the institutions, that it was likely to happen here (it's always likely I figure).


But it's not like any of my calls have expired yet..."
2021-06-09 15:10:28,wallstreetbets,So i am a noob but that crazy jump in fee borrow is nuts. They only have 100k shares available. There is no way they can keep this up. Again i am a noob but ate we in the middle of the squeeze?

2021-06-09 18:44:46,wallstreetbets,CLOV is a pump and dump sourced by hedgies. Do some research this company has 4 employees 😂
2021-06-09 19:10:13,wallstreetbets,Definitely didn’t get the same support GME/AMC did for some reason. Technicals aside people wanna shit on people here for no reason lately
2021-06-09 14:20:31,wallstreetbets,Cheap at the moment. $1.50 per call.
2021-06-09 14:28:42,wallstreetbets,Possibly. I think can go to 40. Ofcouse no guarantees.

2021-06-09 14:25:13,wallstreetbets,"Not a pump and dump, genuinely has a high short interest, as you can see from the borrow fee."
2021-06-09 18:44:49,wallstreetbets,I recommend looking clov up on youtube. They have actual value as a company and zero debt.  The biggest investors in them are large institutions like Blackrock that only invest in companies with a real future.
2021-06-09 14:28:04,wallstreetbets,More dump than pump
2021-06-09 17:15:26,wallstreetbets,"My avg is $20, fingers crossed I can make up my loss"

2021-06-09 14:20:02,wallstreetbets,I already did by buying calls today
2021-06-09 15:57:42,wallstreetbets,I’m holding 100@ $27.00 so you’d be getting a bargain by comparison. I went in this morning and got immediately fucked. So now I’m long CLOV.

2021-06-09 14:29:52,wallstreetbets,Puts are different from a short. Also buying puts now is a bad idea due to IV crush that is likely to happen.
2021-06-09 17:39:38,wallstreetbets,and then you manipulated the stock by telling everyone to sell in the CLOV chat room - you Sir are a grade A dick - you should be banned from Reddit - that is a shit bag move my man -
2021-06-09 16:43:18,wallstreetbets,I made 100% returns on puts today. They’re going to print even more tomorrow when this pump & dump crash lands

2021-06-09 19:17:55,wallstreetbets,Till I die.
2021-06-09 17:42:33,wallstreetbets,can you give some reasoning why?
2021-06-09 14:34:27,wallstreetbets,"You say there isn’t enough short interest as you give data that shows short interest of the is 45 percent of the float and only 20 percent of the float on GME. Do you know what you are talking about? By the way I hope you realize Citadel also owns calls in AMC, and owns shares in GME. They are market makers, they own thousands of different stocks"
2021-06-09 14:42:01,wallstreetbets,You just mathematically showed why CLOV has more squeeze to go?
2021-06-09 14:37:26,wallstreetbets,"By the way fee is now 116 percent as well, check fintel. Your data is outdated."
2021-06-09 14:28:03,wallstreetbets,"Good man, love you fellow ape, thats what I have  been saying the whole day"

2021-06-09 16:17:18,wallstreetbets,Citadel owns virtually no stake in $CLOV.
2021-06-09 17:20:08,wallstreetbets,FYI....a reverse repo is when the banks lend money to the Fed in exchange for treasuries. With aggressive QE the Fed has been buying bonds like crazy and the banks are sitting on a shitload of cash they are not lending out.

2021-06-09 18:08:15,wallstreetbets,"You're an idiot for real. Hyping people up about a pump and dump. Want to video chat, feel free to as I know people are screaming bots hedgies and the rest. Clov has 4 employees and citadel own a fuck load of shares? Not a bit suspect?  They ride it up, get everyone on board and then dump it and short against clov so that they make double bubble."
2021-06-09 16:29:37,wallstreetbets,Me too holding 29 bought a 27 and my wallet hurting rn
2021-06-09 16:19:08,wallstreetbets,I hope you eventually can work it up so that you can get out even.
2021-06-09 14:36:38,wallstreetbets,Hold or sell? I'm similar
2021-06-09 17:13:24,wallstreetbets,"This has no debt and index companies will be buying a shit load of shares around June 25, but thanks for participating."
2021-06-09 17:11:30,wallstreetbets,Thoughts on 25@$9.15? Got in a month or so ago when I saw a dd on clov.
2021-06-09 18:57:38,wallstreetbets,I don’t think you know what bag holder means.
2021-06-09 18:55:59,wallstreetbets,At 9 bones a share that still puts him up nearly 100% RN. If he’s holding a bag it’s of money
2021-06-09 17:15:16,wallstreetbets,100 shares? I don’t consider that anywhere near a bag holder. But we are all retarded 🦍 let’s make some money together
2021-06-09 14:31:47,wallstreetbets,I know what puts are lol I trade options. I bought in when IV was below 150% trust me. I’m good.
2021-06-09 18:00:23,wallstreetbets,"When buying puts you think of a reasonable price target and measure the intrinsic value, IV being high makes it a bit more rough but puts at 26->28$ were fine, especially if they were closer to ITM, 15/16/18/20 that I have are all 100%+ profit"
2021-06-09 17:48:23,wallstreetbets,You must be crazy bc I was never in a chat. Then to say one person manipulated a stock?  Are you using common sense?
2021-06-09 18:14:26,wallstreetbets,Now you wanna be quiet after you look dumb as fuck. You’re account has no history besides pumping CLOV.
2021-06-09 17:49:53,wallstreetbets,Its owned by shitardel this is just a way they can make money out of you they will dump you and take the profits to short amc and gme ...
2021-06-09 14:36:26,wallstreetbets,"My data goes by s3 which is the leader in short interest 


They can't get out of amc or gme I guess you didn't see the data now  that was just release from ortex either with what they just uncovered ...."
2021-06-09 14:48:51,wallstreetbets,"Actually they don't... check how many institutions  hold shares in the company also do not go by fintel as they have been off alot 

my data is from s3 which is the leader in short interest"
2021-06-09 14:49:29,wallstreetbets,By the way have you looked at what ortex just uncovered? Fintel showed  something way different and didnt add up
2021-06-09 14:40:23,wallstreetbets,By the way have you seen what ortex just uncovered ?
2021-06-09 14:46:41,wallstreetbets,By the way my info is from s3 which is the leader in short interest fintel has been wrong alot with alot of numbers
2021-06-09 14:39:43,wallstreetbets,No it's not this data is from s3 who is the lead follower on short interest
2021-06-09 14:29:58,wallstreetbets,I also tried warning people  yesterday  but now pple are starting to realize something  isnt right all I'm trying to do is look out for pple
2021-06-09 14:31:01,wallstreetbets,Exactly but now people are starting to wake up and notice something isn't right
2021-06-09 15:02:43,wallstreetbets,For what exactly ?? My data is from s3 and provides accurate information by the way have you checked out what ortex just put out ... fintel numbers showed some bogus numbers and ortex just confirmed it for amc
2021-06-09 16:19:58,wallstreetbets,Citadel  owns 500k shares Aswells  an ton of options on the stock
2021-06-09 16:18:29,wallstreetbets,🤣 105 percent is owned by Institutions   check your facts
2021-06-09 17:24:01,wallstreetbets,Guess you dont understand  how the train is connected
2021-06-09 17:30:16,wallstreetbets,Yee yee
2021-06-09 17:16:04,wallstreetbets,Lmfao!!!!!
2021-06-09 18:40:21,wallstreetbets,"Nahh, OGs from January and before know it's GME or nothing. Maybe AMC was somewhat legitimate, but not anymore after the share offerings. Good luck to everyone, but GME is the one and only real MOASS.

Hedgies probably pumping all these meme stocks to cover their GME losses, hence the huge sell off this morning."
2021-06-09 18:38:34,wallstreetbets,Well I bought yesterday at around the same price and I'm still holding. To the moon.
2021-06-09 15:23:41,wallstreetbets,Ignore message i did not see notification. I am looking at august calls right now. Feel like that is 8 weeks out which accounts for some settlement dates. But am somewhat fomoing and want to buy earlier. Someone other than people saying buy and eat crayons actually give some good thoughts. I have mine but am looking to align with someone else in a way.
2021-06-09 15:26:48,wallstreetbets,Keep buying the dips
2021-06-09 17:28:35,wallstreetbets,"bro, you mean 25 June?"
2021-06-09 19:09:30,wallstreetbets,"They definitely do, exclusively to mainly GME & AMC, nothing else"
2021-06-09 17:18:45,wallstreetbets,"It’s not even about apes at this point it’s just common sense if the stock goes up 100 to 200 percent in a few days…  you’re fucking retarded buying anything in regards to that stock no matter what, whales will DUMP on you Unless there’s 1 billion other buyers buying those shares  up"
2021-06-09 18:52:39,wallstreetbets,Cite for four employees?
2021-06-09 19:37:27,wallstreetbets,"hay dumass they own 500,000 that aint shit a pissy 10 mil and hfs lost 500mil yesterday do the math dumass"
2021-06-09 18:49:57,wallstreetbets,irony
2021-06-09 19:56:42,wallstreetbets,Option chain
2021-06-09 18:53:47,wallstreetbets,Same. Still green on it but not like I was at market open
2021-06-09 18:32:40,wallstreetbets,"It’s 100% okay to feel this way but why be a prick about it? Seriously, just shut the fuck up if you’re gonna be a dickhead. I’ll bet real money you don’t talk shit like this face to face."
2021-06-09 14:37:49,wallstreetbets,Hold!!!💎🙌
2021-06-09 18:09:16,wallstreetbets,Look a little someone up called citadel.
2021-06-09 18:59:24,wallstreetbets,I don't think you know why CLOV is absolute garbage bullshit.
2021-06-09 19:02:10,wallstreetbets,"He said he won't sell ""anytime soon"". By the time he realized his bag will be worthless."
2021-06-09 16:19:47,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't trust you to flush my shit down the toilet
2021-06-09 18:03:52,wallstreetbets,They buy practically every stock in the market and own <1%. The fact that Citadel owns something doesn't make it a bad trade.
2021-06-09 19:25:34,wallstreetbets,You should sell AMC and GME if that is your reasoning. They own more shares in those companies than CLOV lol
2021-06-09 14:53:15,wallstreetbets,"I dunno I may be lost by the relevance of the numbers. To me your saying CLOV has 43.54% shares shorted vs 19% GME and 11.59% on AMC. I mean correct me if I’m wrong about something here but it sounds like CLOV is gassing up. 

I do know institutions run everything as you mentioned before but to me this is irrelevant as all stocks are institutionally owned

What happened with Ortex?"
2021-06-09 14:43:37,wallstreetbets,Yes that AMC short interest is a lot higher then expected and shorts didn’t actually cover but instead borrowed shares that weren’t shorted were covered. I will be opening a position back in AMC once clov is done. But holding WKHS for longer because I think it has more potential because of less institutions owners
2021-06-09 14:41:31,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes the good old “your source is wrong mine is right” 
Your source is correct, but it’s from a day ago. Yesterday short fee was 4 percent. Now it is 116 percent as updated 1 hour ago.
Here is the link so you can see for yourself 

https://fintel.io/ss/us/clov"
2021-06-09 15:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Because you’re copying and pasting this propaganda everywhere… I see u, ape smell poop"
2021-06-09 17:12:21,wallstreetbets,Which is less than 1% ape. They own more AMC.
2021-06-09 17:25:22,wallstreetbets,"I do, but for you to say 2+2=5 you have to get called out"
2021-06-09 17:30:56,wallstreetbets,Buy some CLOV
2021-06-09 18:53:46,wallstreetbets,"GME is the BTC of meme stocks, sure. But with enough capital and monitoring you can play all the fields. You don’t have to limit it to GME or die. BTC is currently losing that battle to ETH."
2021-06-09 19:00:48,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-06-09 14:52:54,wallstreetbets,Whats the magic number we're looking g for? I'm an amateur at this
2021-06-09 16:23:32,wallstreetbets,That’s cool. I’m sitting on 2000% gains off my calls and sold at the top. Wbu?
2021-06-09 14:56:48,wallstreetbets,Fintel gave us bogus numbers s3 provided accurate number ortex just confirmed short interest as of May 28th is 102 mil short interest for amc ... looks like amc will moon soon
2021-06-09 15:06:10,wallstreetbets,Also you have to look at who owns the float  institutions  own it by large margin
2021-06-09 14:45:16,wallstreetbets,Good man just be careful I gave you all the information I can to help pple
2021-06-09 14:43:45,wallstreetbets,Again your going by fintel.... s3 is the leader in short interest in the market by the way did you see what ortex just uncovered o wait you follow fintel they didn't say anything relevant
2021-06-09 15:10:09,wallstreetbets,How is it propaganda when it's true I'm sorry your not educated on it and how it works when something is found it gets brought to light and clearly you are sheltered from knowing actual facts ... it's ok not like the truth but it helps you better yourself and I want to look out for pple with actual facts and data knowledge  to know the difference  of what they are getting themselves into
2021-06-09 17:14:10,wallstreetbets,Again amc they cannot get of because they owe to much ... so there stuck ...institutions  in clov is 105 percent ...
2021-06-09 17:16:37,wallstreetbets,"Also didn't you see the news ortex about amc ??? 🤣🤣 fintel put out bogus numbers ...


All data I have posted is from s3 the leader on short interest ..."
2021-06-09 14:56:02,wallstreetbets,"We expecting 40+ after that it’s up to you when you get out, how much risk you can stomach."
2021-06-09 16:49:02,wallstreetbets,Come on you are talking to fellow degenerate gamblers. Tell us about the losses.
2021-06-09 14:58:50,wallstreetbets,Ortex is asking me to sign up for something?
2021-06-09 15:28:12,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that who owned GME and AMC though? Shoot AMC just openly threw shares at an institution to raise money and no one cares lol. So why would anyone care here?
2021-06-09 15:50:43,wallstreetbets,"You sound like you work for S3, or something.  Either way you arent coming off like you are acting in good faith, thats why youre getting metaphorically jumped here."
2021-06-09 15:42:55,wallstreetbets,"i don't know anything about anything, but someone said to buy it so i did"
2021-06-09 17:21:12,wallstreetbets,Which is due in part to shorts. This is how AMC and GME started. Looks like shorts won out but your DD is terrible.
2021-06-09 16:56:22,wallstreetbets,I was down 50% on my amc calls but exited immediately lmao
2021-06-09 14:59:16,wallstreetbets,Also ortex only gets data when they don't get fucked over by brokers like in this cases always check several others Aswell Check there twitter
2021-06-09 15:32:19,wallstreetbets,And they cannot get out because they are trapped and owe a ton of money .. amc didn't openly throw shares ... they had stated they were going to use up share months ago.. and that was there since 4 years ago . clearly you don't know what your talking about .. the difference here is institutions are in the opposite  side of the fence and own 105 percent
2021-06-09 15:55:41,wallstreetbets,But I am tho and it's up to you to decide if you wanna fact check it you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him drink it  and I don't need to work for s3 it's public information anyone can look it up
2021-06-09 17:48:41,wallstreetbets,Don't do that always research  amc just did a count  501 million shares and some how there 872 million shares  institutions  are fucked its time to strap in boys amc is going to the moon
2021-06-09 17:21:48,wallstreetbets,Actually no it's not but good try
2021-06-09 15:58:32,wallstreetbets,Actually thats not true at all. They did an offering months ago and just did another one. Your saying institutions own 105% of AMC?? 🤨 I’m just asking and answering basic questions. Things like “you dont know etc” just tells me your grasping for straws here and oddly want CLOV to go down 🤔
2021-06-09 17:34:58,wallstreetbets,Institutional ownership over 100% was literally part of the DD behind the January GME short squeeze. It means a bunch of synthetic shares are being traded.
2021-06-09 15:59:23,wallstreetbets,No 105 percent is own in clove
2021-06-09 16:02:16,wallstreetbets,Also what part was not true  look up the share holders meeting before you comment that your saying is not true they had shares they were holding in reserve  next time get the fact straight about on how and why before jumping the gun shareholders knew what was going on
2021-06-09 17:39:37,wallstreetbets,Guess you didn't hear what just happened with amc ?????  There more then 872 million shares on the count there only 501 avail  🤣🤣 amc is going to moon now better jump on it institutions  are officially fucked
2021-06-09 16:09:16,wallstreetbets,"Its ok bro I gotchu, in Q1 they issued 278 million shares. They just did the offering to the institution more recently for 11 million shares."
2021-06-09 16:15:49,wallstreetbets,Again it's not new news to pple that are shareholder they got know before anything ... again Apples to oranges
2021-06-09 16:16:22,wallstreetbets,Thats why I thought it was weird when you wanted to argue about it 😂😂😂
2021-06-09 16:17:27,wallstreetbets,O no lol I was saying that as shareholders new before anything beforebthe bs articles lol
2021-06-09 14:21:33,wallstreetbets,Good luck with  20 contracts you have 10X the balls of my self!

2021-06-09 14:17:36,wallstreetbets,"Some education  for pple getting on a hype train 


It's a pump and dump  citadel  is making money from you they have tons of contracts on the way up and on the way down and they are going to dump shares there limit to dump 30 to 90 day guess how long its been since they acquired shares ...... all look at the reverse repo they were lent out money so were other hedge funds . It has now reached an all time high... everyone flocking to clov for some reason and thinking it's going to squeeze its not

2021-06-09 16:12:13,wallstreetbets,I just took the L and dumped it back into AMC. I figure I may as well try and take my buddy's advice and invest in companies I actually like/support. Ive been riding AMC since the beginning of the pandemic because I'm a huge movie buff and I was trying to help them survive. I actually had AMC's A List Membership before the pandemic hit and plan on getting it again. I will never pay for Netflix or any other service because I can stream anything for free. The A List Membership is the only thing I would ever pay for. I'm even debating dropping Amazon because I don't really order anything anymore.
2021-06-09 14:43:49,wallstreetbets,"The good news is that it's very obvious $14 is a reasonable price, it literally traded at double that just months ago, and nothing has changed! This really is different from the other WSB plays, the stock is actually worth more than that. At least I WISH it is."
2021-06-09 14:44:48,wallstreetbets,WISH for the win! It's not overvalued and can go up without WSB support!

2021-06-09 14:30:16,wallstreetbets,it has been shorted and distorted.
2021-06-09 14:49:06,wallstreetbets,"There's two huge factors working against coinbase...

1. Crypto is essentially a bear market, \*any\* negative news (even if it's BS out of context like the recent ""Feds recover bitcoin for Colonial Pipeline"") will drive the prices down temporarily. The overall volatility is still too much for many.

2. Like others said, lots of competition out there, so unless they have a sizeable competitive advantage their stock is just going to drift along.

&#x200B;

Your call on what to do... Either cut your losses and invest in something with better returns, or hold for the long term and see where it goes."
2021-06-09 14:52:07,wallstreetbets,I bought in @ $330 and sold all for a loss once dipped under $300. I started buying back in when it hit $250sh and have averaged down since the crypto crash. 10% of portfolio 52 @234.52
2021-06-09 14:13:25,wallstreetbets,I think it’ll passed that price again eventually . Could take a while tho
2021-06-09 14:25:06,wallstreetbets,I use Coinbase to buy my crypto…. I think one day it will go back up because they take a fee for both sides of the transaction. The more users coming on-line and getting into crypto the more revenue they will have. If they take those fees and reinvest them in crypto and crypto rebounds. Skyrocket.
2021-06-09 14:19:33,wallstreetbets,I'm holding the bag on some COIN too. I've got faith tho. That app is going to be around for a long time.
2021-06-09 14:27:48,wallstreetbets,"Too much competition out there, coin is no longer the only way to buy crypto. They no longer hold any competitive advantage."
2021-06-09 14:22:32,wallstreetbets,"Its essentially a market bet on crypto. What is challenging is that its an equity, so you are tied to 9:30-4 each day, where cryptos tend to see big movement outside trading hours. Its hard cause you are basically limited to trading during trading hours on news/market that operates at 24/7 in the crypto world. For a long hold, if you can keep grabbing it at this down point, it will work out. But cryptos are starting to fall below 50d/200d lines which means if they do pull up it could take a while."
2021-06-09 15:14:21,wallstreetbets,Looks like a pretty good exit right here. You bought at the top of a massive crypto-rally. Sell and buy EV stocks while still 50% off highs. You'll be thanking me when COIN hits 30 and you're up 100%.

2021-06-09 14:25:55,wallstreetbets,They cover 400k shares last week and it jumped over 100% they are still 100mil short something like that but all good man I was being a dink best of luck to ya
2021-06-09 14:54:02,wallstreetbets,How much higher can amc go? Could it go to 200 or 300?
2021-06-09 15:10:02,wallstreetbets,I can’t give a price target but this is something thats never happened before retail own the float so when it’s time for them to cover and nobody sells the demand will go higher and higher making the price rise till we let them cover that’s just my opinion but based off the 100% gain off a tiny fraction of shorts covered I think it’ll go high as fuck
2021-06-09 16:20:02,wallstreetbets,High as fuck like $500?
2021-06-09 16:49:22,wallstreetbets,Who knows I’m selling on the way down after the shorts have covered

2021-06-09 14:02:32,wallstreetbets,"get in with a company that actually worth helping..$Clne has good if not great fundamentals .. 
let's Go Ape with purpose.🍌🦍🚀"
2021-06-09 14:04:53,wallstreetbets,Sndl is such a trap stock.
2021-06-09 14:08:19,wallstreetbets,"AMC, trading at a nice discount."
2021-06-09 14:30:17,wallstreetbets,You only lost if you closed your position
2021-06-09 16:09:51,wallstreetbets,TLRY IS better
2021-06-09 14:33:34,wallstreetbets,Never sell WISH
2021-06-09 14:01:45,wallstreetbets,Cuz I’m absolutely retarded
2021-06-09 14:33:39,wallstreetbets,SNDL is a worthless stock
2021-06-09 14:50:16,wallstreetbets,I agree. SNDL will pay off imo
2021-06-09 14:03:51,wallstreetbets,"That makes too much sense, I’m trying to loose all my money"

2021-06-09 14:05:20,wallstreetbets,"Pull your money out now and just sit on it for a day or two. Don’t go chasing dumb ass plays because you’re hurt about losing some money. Don’t be emotional in the market

Edit: looking at your post history- you’ve lost a shit load of money. Pull out now and just chill. Take a break. Clear your head. The market will be here in a month"
2021-06-09 14:05:57,wallstreetbets,you kidding me! ..you work fucking hard for that money don't just throw it away ..Apes unite $CLNE

2021-06-09 14:51:13,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-09 16:18:43,wallstreetbets,Next time post your order first so that we all have a chance to win
2021-06-09 14:03:43,wallstreetbets,Yep! Took out 10x of my initial $300 before I snapped this. Funny I nearly bought 1000 more of these but this will do lol 🚀
2021-06-09 16:43:59,wallstreetbets,Right?? My bro was pissed when he saw 😂 I just aped in before close.
2021-06-09 14:21:46,wallstreetbets,"It looks like it is comming down off of a ~15% move. Are you expecting this to form a bull flag or retrace down further? 

Your reasoning in the DD makes sense, the only apprehension I have is that it seems to be recovering relatively slowly when compared to other stocks which COVID had its way with."
2021-06-09 14:13:57,wallstreetbets,Positions?
2021-06-09 14:45:38,wallstreetbets,Alright I'm in for 1k shares and 10 calls for 01/22
2021-06-09 14:33:03,wallstreetbets,in regards to technical analysis i see this as following a trendline upwads with a small correction but not breaking past the 20 or 50 day MA looking at an expanded 3 month window. in the past week it has gone below the 20 day MA but hit a resistance at the 50 day MA. I expect it to continue trending upwards. so I expect to see a bull flag.
2021-06-09 14:18:03,wallstreetbets,I'm not rich by any means. I have 77 shares and 1 $5 call option set to expire 01/21/2022
2021-06-09 14:22:12,wallstreetbets,I have a set recurring investment in MITT but I only put in what I'm willing to lose. I am saving to buy a house and with today's market I am shit out of luck.

2021-06-09 13:55:25,wallstreetbets,"I know it's not about the company itself, but where I had sympathy for BB, Gamestop or AMC, I wholeheartedly detest Wish."
2021-06-09 14:13:11,wallstreetbets,Do you guys thinkt the squeeze on WISH already happened?
2021-06-09 13:54:07,wallstreetbets,Dude they are gonna leave us to die. It’s up to us to fix this. I’m down 700 on clov and 500 on wish. U will be ok. I dug my self out of a 7000 dollar loss this week. If my retarded ass can do it so can you
2021-06-09 14:51:16,wallstreetbets,"Don't sell brother, give it some time, this company has actual value"
2021-06-09 17:00:23,wallstreetbets,I buy more before the market close. Hold the line soldier.

2021-06-09 13:57:04,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I bought 250 Wish this morning and I'm down between 600-800 depending on these dips....  


Honestly thinking about just selling. This stock mad me angry because it immediately dips after I put money in it....but has had zero growth despite more people buying than selling."
2021-06-09 14:52:55,wallstreetbets,Got some shares and quite a few contracts. I ain’t going anywhere lol. Good luck to you
2021-06-09 14:14:00,wallstreetbets,I’ve noticed. I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised

2021-06-09 13:58:44,wallstreetbets,That’s what they keep telling us not to do. Don’t be a bitch and sell. Just wait. My patience made me 1700 on clove alone last night. Just wait and buy more if u can
2021-06-09 14:56:51,wallstreetbets,"Yesssir I'm all in as well, diamond hands till I die"
2021-06-09 16:28:31,wallstreetbets,Yep! I am also! How dare it keep dropping!
2021-06-09 14:05:10,wallstreetbets,True...but it was $8 just a few days ago too....
2021-06-09 14:03:19,wallstreetbets,But the question is how long. I’m to impatient to wait a week. I need this day in day out kinda flow.
2021-06-09 14:08:36,wallstreetbets,"From someone who would be up over 500k from 30k if I never sold my investment and only waited or bought more, learn from my mistakes and just hold. It will always bounce back harder then the fall on these meme stocks"
2021-06-09 14:03:36,wallstreetbets,"I guess I can wait it out...I wasn't really planning on keeping money in Wish for very long to begin with.  


Thought I could make a decent profit just for a 1-3 days before selling.....just puts a bad taste in my mouth is all....  


I know you only lose when you sell..But idk what's going on with this stock at the moment."
2021-06-09 14:23:22,wallstreetbets,"I am not giving financial advice. I can just say I will hold, as I feel that we have a longer breath than the shorties. I mean look at the volume today"
2021-06-09 14:11:00,wallstreetbets,I doubt your real ( actually paranoid) but if you are. This gave me hope. So thankyou.
2021-06-09 14:05:58,wallstreetbets,I know how that feels trust me. I try to sell off at the end of each day even for losses but u can’t fuck urself out of 500. That shit can make u 5000 to 50k if u play it right.
2021-06-09 14:06:57,wallstreetbets,"And neither do I, but hey this is a casino not a Wendy’s. I’m sure u get my point"

2021-06-09 13:57:16,wallstreetbets,I missed this takeoff
2021-06-09 14:02:45,wallstreetbets,Not even remotely. It’s barely up 11% and the majority of WSB hasn’t even caught on to the play.
2021-06-09 14:02:55,wallstreetbets,Still time the contracts are super cheap
2021-06-09 14:16:48,wallstreetbets,Could I DM you with questions about the call option? I am new to options and not crystal clear on how they work exactly
2021-06-09 14:13:59,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna lie, I understand contracts in theory but in practice I’m confused"
2021-06-09 14:14:58,wallstreetbets,Just bought an option!

2021-06-09 14:48:16,wallstreetbets,"Easily my favorite speculative squeeze. Low market cap, little volume, great chart, highly memeable, higher short float % than most of the other crap wsb is pumping."
2021-06-09 14:15:01,wallstreetbets,im in for a 100 shares
2021-06-09 15:49:23,wallstreetbets,this is the deepest of deep value plays. I'm all the way in. get ready for lift off. I'm a TWNK bull. I'm so long its not even funny
2021-06-09 14:14:51,wallstreetbets,Positions?
2021-06-09 19:18:02,wallstreetbets,Definitely meme potential on TWNK. It also seems like a very low risk investment (their dips are currently 1~3%

2021-06-09 13:51:52,wallstreetbets,When is dividends on this one?
2021-06-09 13:56:55,wallstreetbets,Soooo undervalued
2021-06-09 13:55:50,wallstreetbets,Holding 100 shares @ $10. Selling is not an option.
2021-06-09 13:51:00,wallstreetbets,Worth $18-$20 a share without being overvalued.
2021-06-09 14:34:19,wallstreetbets,Share buyback was the LFG for me
2021-06-09 14:47:57,wallstreetbets,Honestly I sold all my calls this morning with the gamma and used it to buy shares since I had yoloed my account into calls
2021-06-09 14:44:19,wallstreetbets,Holding 10k shares @9.2
2021-06-09 15:04:19,wallstreetbets,"680 @ 8.53 and a few calls.

Even the CEO is with us at war with the short sellers by initiating a 300m buyback of shares"
2021-06-09 15:26:50,wallstreetbets,Bought my measly 100 shares today.

2021-06-09 16:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Been holding since $8 a share.

One of the very few stocks listed on WSB that actually has solid fundamentals. And dividends. Even if this doesn't squeeze I'm in it for the long haul."
2021-06-09 14:05:36,wallstreetbets,Wait till this gets some more attention. 🚀🚀
2021-06-09 14:54:33,wallstreetbets,Not much but I've had 20 shares that I bought @ $6.80

2021-06-09 13:50:05,wallstreetbets,I'm still hodl
2021-06-09 15:13:13,wallstreetbets,You can not buy today to receive the dividend on 7/6. Today is the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the day the stock starts trading without the value of its next dividend payment.
2021-06-09 15:22:23,wallstreetbets,The open interest on the 6/18 10c is actually only 42k

2021-06-09 17:32:50,wallstreetbets,I heard Russell inclusion this Friday and only 89 million share float.
2021-06-09 17:52:15,wallstreetbets,Ishbia is going to windmill dunk on this opportunity.
2021-06-09 18:20:52,wallstreetbets,In for 80k shares
2021-06-09 13:54:05,wallstreetbets,I have 160c
2021-06-09 16:10:42,wallstreetbets,Definitely worth a buy. Short or Long - $.10's a share in dividends. I have bought and will continue to buy this MF.
2021-06-09 18:53:26,wallstreetbets,I'm doing my part 27k shares been waiting for squeeze chatter for a while before even thought of been here since December
2021-06-09 19:39:15,wallstreetbets,Now or tomorrow is a actually a legit time to strengthen or open a position with uwmc. This looks good
2021-06-09 19:46:16,wallstreetbets,I've been in UWMC since it dropped to 8.49. Gonna hold this stock forever. Got some calls though.

2021-06-09 17:37:35,wallstreetbets,It’s PE ratio is 44.58. Doesn’t that mean it’s overvalued?
2021-06-09 14:25:15,wallstreetbets,So buy puts?
2021-06-09 19:36:02,wallstreetbets,"I think I bought this today, fuck, so many meme moon shots I can't keep track! -Lol"
2021-06-09 15:08:13,wallstreetbets,Today last day to get dividend on July 6 So you have like 50 mins to buy some. Bought 130 shares today.
2021-06-09 19:32:01,wallstreetbets,Holding a 7 dollar leap and 26 shares.
2021-06-09 14:00:55,wallstreetbets,Confirmed 🚀 hop on boys 🤙

2021-06-09 13:55:45,wallstreetbets,July 06 which isn’t as far off as it seems
2021-06-09 14:18:20,wallstreetbets,"I agree, plenty of upside on UWMC. I'm on board"
2021-06-09 16:38:43,wallstreetbets,"Best actual value play, also has nearly no shares left to borrow for short sellers and a borrow fee of 38%+ and rising"
2021-06-09 19:45:27,wallstreetbets,Actually fair value is closer to 11 ro 13 bucks. Not 20
2021-06-09 16:04:09,wallstreetbets,"And the share price is already near the strike, which means the MM's are covered or close to it. There's 68k open interest at $9 so maybe that's where he's getting 100k (68k+42k, so actually 110k), but it doesn't matter, those are covered too. I don't think anyone posting here knows how a gamma squeeze happens or how to recognize one when it does."
2021-06-09 18:55:54,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah recirculating my Dividend $2710
2021-06-09 18:15:14,wallstreetbets,"Do it, pussy."

2021-06-09 19:31:54,wallstreetbets,But which one will it be?
2021-06-09 19:50:45,wallstreetbets,So true
2021-06-09 14:12:36,wallstreetbets,Thats the payout date. Today is the date uou need to have shares by market close. Solid company too. I almost want to downvote posts about it to keep the mouthbreathers from turning it into a pump and dump
2021-06-09 13:58:38,wallstreetbets,Say less!!!  15k at the end of the month. Why??? Because I’m an ape🦍🍌🍌 and I want to see the moon 🌝🚀🚀🚀 yolo!!!!! 🚀🚀🚀 💎💎hands
2021-06-09 16:10:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you’re right. I did some quick mental math but the 100K open interest actually came from the 6/18 $9c as well as the $10c. I made this post on a hurry on my phone so I didn’t have time to double check. I also have no idea how the fuck a gamma squeeze actually works."
2021-06-09 18:15:38,wallstreetbets,You are what you eat...

2021-06-09 16:49:02,wallstreetbets,Price needs to go up fast and put expiring high OI strikes in the money. MM's hedge with shares on the way up. They don't just buy all the need when the share price hits the strike. The entire market would be insanely volatile if that were the case.
2021-06-09 19:40:08,wallstreetbets,"Considering I bought RKT calls, you’re probably right!"
2021-06-09 16:46:32,wallstreetbets,"Ah, i had it wrong. Oh well."

2021-06-09 14:07:18,wallstreetbets,The June calls are my casino gamble. It's a risky bet for me.

2021-06-09 14:49:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah dude. And if I'm wrong you can always reinvest in a new meme stock next week. I like the meme potential of RKT with the housing market hot and a P/E of 8ish.

2021-06-09 14:19:58,wallstreetbets,I'm a long-term bull. I just think the action on the indexes is whack right now. The easing of semiconductor supply constraints makes me less worried about inflation in the long-term.
2021-06-09 14:07:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah. You can buy puts that have a <1% break even price 0-2 days before expiration and get decent leverage without being stupidly OTM or paying wild time premium. They can pay off huge if you get a big move but will also quickly cost you thousands if you're wrong or time it badly. It's also really tough to time the exit of the trade because the IV burn is really bad. Not recommending it but that's a way to do it on a budget.
2021-06-09 14:46:34,wallstreetbets,Could also try TQQQ puts maybe.
2021-06-09 13:40:32,wallstreetbets,TLT puts are in the 200-300 range
2021-06-09 13:51:16,wallstreetbets,"Well it’s leveraged so maybe not a great long term trade, but SQQQ if your thinking about a quick rip tomorrow"
2021-06-09 15:27:55,wallstreetbets,"Well, I might keep my amc positions then. Already intended on keep my GME"
2021-06-09 17:26:19,wallstreetbets,"In all seriousness tho, meme stocks are just that. Memes. Unfounded and mostly pnd. Just look at GME right now. It's so insane. It will be interesting to se how a possible correction will affect them"
2021-06-09 14:45:22,wallstreetbets,TQQQ puts actually could be a good play. $6.00 for ITM puts expiring July 2 and you need a 2% dip in QQQ to break even. I might actually try those.
2021-06-09 14:17:30,wallstreetbets,"See, I hate this trade. SQQQ is currently at $10.00. That means even a 10% correction on the Nasdaq only translates to a ~$300 per-call profit for an ITM call. A 10% correction on an ITM QQQ put translates to a ~$3400 per-put profit. I'd rather just go OTM on very short dated QQQ puts than fuck with the -3x leverage for the risk-reward you get. TQQQ is an okay bullish play since you actually have a decent underlying price but the inverse funds need to do a reverse split to make them at all worth buying options in them. (Nothing against you, I just don't like the play)"
2021-06-09 15:37:49,wallstreetbets,I like AMC under a 30B market cap. That's not totally unfounded. They can use the funds they raised to buy every local theater that went under over the past year.
2021-06-09 16:07:57,wallstreetbets,"Unlike AMC, I feel GME is vastly overpriced. If we are talking fundamentals, I don't think Cohens strategy will save the retailer. He is entering into an area that already has good saturation. GME may be able to earn some initial capitol via offloading real estate (the K-Mart approach), but I am starting to agree with institutional investors that it really will end up going to Blockbuster route, although maybe it has been delayed a bit."
2021-06-09 17:00:12,wallstreetbets,"Retail investors are ignoring that physical games in general aren't a hot commodity. 

Sony made \~3.5x revenue on digital sales than they did on physical.

Microsoft is focused on service offerings like Game Pass too.

GameStop isn't going to die anytime soon but they're not going to magically reverse the trend of falling physical sales as a recurring revenue.

2.5 million shares at 3:20pm and about 3.4 million within the prior 20 mins. Crazy. Someone's gonna regret that tomorrow."
2021-06-09 13:25:29,wallstreetbets,I believe in TLRY. Won't be $300 but let's see it hit $60+ again.

2021-06-09 14:52:05,wallstreetbets,"Do you seriously think they would let it get to 500k and let you be able to sell? Not a chance, you seen what they did with GME when it hit $500 they cut that quickly and drove the price down. If AMC hits tripple digits you better be smart and take profits"
2021-06-09 16:26:16,wallstreetbets,Lmao. Good luck with that.
2021-06-09 14:31:03,wallstreetbets,"It's almost as if some hedge fund conspired to create this narrative of buying and not selling or the company itself.  


The thinking is that the WSBers are so dumb, we can convince them to hold after they had made returns that the average investor may never see in a lifetime."
2021-06-09 13:46:20,wallstreetbets,Also it has been squeezed out so the weakest shorts have already covered. The new short interest is at higher cost basis per share so they're harder to squeeze out. They can be squeezed out but I think it will require so much capital to do that it isn't really realistic at this point. Shares are too high priced now. If shares were $5-$10 and the SI was 40%+ then that would be totally different story.
2021-06-09 15:40:06,wallstreetbets,"Why would I sell before the squeeze, why lose out in that kind of money"

2021-06-09 14:31:42,wallstreetbets,"Bro, these people do not care about facts. They want to lose money at this point."
2021-06-09 15:41:07,wallstreetbets,Haha 😂 give me a fucking break. You invested in AMC for its fundamentals? If so then you are beyond retarded.
2021-06-09 16:02:41,wallstreetbets,Have to get people started some where. The chit chat with AMC has seem to fallen off lately.
2021-06-09 15:44:25,wallstreetbets,🤣 citadel is manipulating CLOV and I hope you figure it out the hard way. AMC is making a lot of people rich wether you agree or not

2021-06-09 15:06:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m so deep in UWMC, I’ve got green coming out of my -

Anyway, you should add the gamma squeeze factor. 

UWMC is now above $10, which means over 100,000 options contracts are ITM for June 18th. At $11, it’s something like 120,000 open interest that would be ITM. 

The gamma squeeze is real, and it will probably trigger the short squeeze. 

Oh yeah, and the buybacks too."

2021-06-09 13:32:35,wallstreetbets,That buy back program should scare the hell out of shorts. New companies on the market typically issue more shares in the market.  The complete opposite is happening of why hedgies short new IPO or SPAC.  Beautiful position for a squeeze.  Nice DDick

We got some volume this morning but it seems theres enough borrowable shares out there for the shorts to still drive the price back down. Im sure plenty of people took profits today, but once thats done and the available short supply dwindles this things going to be under some real pressure and its pretty damn expensive to maintain an open short position."

I'm very happy with this one.  You get a dividend, the quarterly earnings reports have been solid, they have been a leader in wholesale mortgages for 6 years straight.

2021-06-09 15:04:20,wallstreetbets,"If it helps, I sold some of those today."
2021-06-09 16:56:04,wallstreetbets,"New to options as well. (This week)

From what I read... it's not just price of the stock, but really the volatility up and down as well. 

If WSB gets a hold of this stock, like they did GME AMC CLOV call option prices go through the roof. (Even of they are not in the money) 

I sold a couple of these same options you mentioned. I purchased yesterday for some pretty good profit today. (Low volume yesterday, high volume stock up 10% today... but options were never in the money) 

It is a true gamble esp with short term calls in my opinion. Think of a short term call option as a pull of the slot machine. You could win big, chances are you just dumped 20 bucks in and got nothing out.... however.... if the stock hits and goes waaay up! OMG huge wins.

I have been looking for ""cheap"" contracts... like .05 to .50 cents per. (They dont have to be in the money, just close to strike price with a lot of volatility from what I have seen) 

BTW.... I notice that there is always a ""sweet spot"" on options pricing... no idea why... but options that expire a week later or earlier at the same strike price is like double the cost. I am dumb so probably missing something completely obvious. 

By going cheap I dont loose everything, and have some good upside! 

These calls sold for 5 cents yesterday and I seen them at over a dollar today. 

Long term calls are totally different in my opinion... I look at those as purchase in something you likely believe in, and dont have dough to purchase shares right now. 


TLDR: not huge balls ape, conservative investor. I purchase cheap calls in hope's they hit big. I have no idea what I am doing. 

Not advice. I am likely drunk and eating crayons in my own tears of lost dough as you read this. 

Good luck !"

But I also think it's a good business with good fundamentals that has momentum.

2021-06-09 17:11:00,wallstreetbets,They don’t buy all 10 million shares once the price passes $10. They buy or sell a portion of the shares as the price moves up or down. You only get a gamma squeeze if the price spikes very high very quickly and they end up needing to suddenly buy a large enough volume of shares in a short enough amount of time to really jack up the bid.

Many steel consuming domestic companies wrote a letter asking for the tariffs to be lifted. Also, the EU has already conceded on many counter-tariffs in good faith. If so, CLF will eat one. Conversely, if the US refuses to lift tariffs, CLF will rocket. I'm too scared for this one but I'm hoping I get major FOMO for the sake of keeping American jobs and steel manufacturing strong."

Put quite a lot into CLOV early yesterday morning and rode it up to $27 today, then dumped it on a Stop Order at $25. Had my eye on CLF Monday and Tuesday but wanted to get in under $20. I settled and got in at $21.20 this morning, thinking it should get up to $25-27 from what I've researched. Just my UNprofessional plow-boy opinion. The play was CLNE, up almost 30% so far this morning but I missed it. Have a Limit Order to buy CLNE at $11.50. Will see if it will execute or not."
2021-06-09 14:28:25,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, but while that is all playing out, iron ore pellets are in high demand from the steel industry, which Cleveland Cliffs supplies through its mines. The demand is still going to be there, allowing up pressure on price"

It's a pump and dump  citadel  is making money from you they have tons of contracts on the way up and on the way down and they are going to dump shares there limit to dump 30 to 90 day guess how long its been since they acquired shares ...... all look at the reverse repo they were lent out money so were other hedge funds . It has now reached an all time high... everyone flocking to clov for some reason and thinking it's going to squeeze its not 

here's some data for you 

$CLOV short interest is $585M 49.10MM shares shorted 43.54% SI% of Float 30.33% S3 SI% Float 2.04% fee and rising to over 4% Shs shorted up +4.53M shares, worth $54M, +10.2%, over the last week. Shorts down -$554M in 2021 mark-to-market losses; down -$502M on today's +85.8% move

2021-06-09 13:23:59,wallstreetbets,"Actually, besides lots from today, my only shares are from back in early March. It was going up steadily until about late April and then was either sold or shorted more, which I’m guessing is what attracted Reddit. Again, do your own DD, but I bought because it is a fundamentally strong company IMO."

2021-06-09 13:09:33,wallstreetbets,Tbh I think if anything bots are downvoting this and pumping WISH and CLNE etc to try and kill $CLOV on its dip after 100% this week

2021-06-09 13:09:26,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-09 13:50:01,wallstreetbets,"From what I have heard, Citadel owns 500k long shares, which is a drop in the bucket for them, and a drop in the bucket compared to the 700 million volume yesterday (and 300 million today so far). 

Again, I encourage everyone to do their own DD because people can skew data and information on here. 

And again, not only is this a short term short squeeze play (do your own DD), but this could be the turning point in a imo fundamentally strong company, similar to how GME has turned around since its squeeze."
2021-06-09 13:29:33,wallstreetbets,More traction than hundreds of millions in volume?

2021-06-09 13:55:55,wallstreetbets,And you are saying your source says there is not enough short interest to cause a short squeeze? I’m struggling to see what you are trying to say. I’m trying to get people to do their own DD vs reading something like this to make decisions.
2021-06-09 13:33:09,wallstreetbets,Same!
2021-06-09 14:03:01,wallstreetbets,There is no short squeeze look up reverse repo citadel  amongst other owe the fed by you guys going over there purchasing up stock the contract citadel has is making them money to pay back the fed today it reached an all time high they need money and suddenly clov poped up and pple don't realize there helping them there making money off contracts and dumping shares

2021-06-09 13:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Let’s do a fair comparison.  

Order from Amzn, next day delivery, stock price $3000+

Order from W, one month delivery, stock price $300+

Order from Wish, two months delivery, stock price $30+

Damn!!!!  Wish is a BUY BUY BUY at this level.  Thx dude!!!"
2021-06-09 15:11:34,wallstreetbets,"Wish local hopefully improves the delivery time. Long delivery times is an issue for e-commerce, but they working on it.

As for their products, people should stop bitching, if you buy a drone for $10 that supposed to cost $200, then expectations should be low. You get what you pay for.

It definitely not a future Amazon, but it fair priced at current range."
2021-06-09 13:09:59,wallstreetbets,This is a dud

I think all these online only retailers are going to take a huge hit once all these restrictions are lifted and people go back to normal life. I'm not just meaning wish, I think Amazon is going to take a huge hit soon too"
2021-06-09 13:24:02,wallstreetbets,Seen the same exact comment on another post fuck off you bot
2021-06-09 13:34:40,wallstreetbets,"Wish’s financials are rather solid, lot of changes have been made to their app/business as well. 
Buying direct from China has been huge for years, not without its own set of challenges though. Wish already made the buying experience so much better. It’s an epic stock if they continue streamlining this experience. 5bn cap is peanuts for this kind of business. Maybe do some DD?"
2021-06-09 13:18:10,wallstreetbets,Enjoy the ride and find a new wave if and when the time comes
2021-06-09 13:41:18,wallstreetbets,I normally keep to myself but I felt compelled bc I like the ticker. Someone wrote out a long DD that I didn’t read and I decided to buy some and the. Some more. Lol don’t look into it too hard I eat crayons!

2021-06-09 13:30:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah because it's my opinion lmao like how am I wrong? Online retailers have been BOOMING during covid, yet Chinese POS a wish has been on a downward spiral the last 5 months, how is that happening? What's going to happen the next few months when all these covid restrictions lift? All these online retailers are going to take a hit"
2021-06-09 13:40:58,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you on all that, and I think they will be in a much better place post-covid, then they were pre-covid. Same with Amazon, Walmart; there are so many online retailers that really benefited with covid.  I just feel that as lockdown and all these restrictions are lifted, that all these online retailers are going to take a hit, especially the ones that are online only"

2021-06-09 13:44:20,wallstreetbets,"This is all China product man, highly doubt people gonna get on a plane to buy it in person haha
Besides you said yourself how beaten down the price was, what you reckon wish at like 2/3 bucks ? 2bil cap ? Even Melvin knows better lmao"
2021-06-09 13:57:52,wallstreetbets,"So what you cry baby bitch? Idgaf what you do, I just gave my opinion on the topic. You still couldn't give me a reason as to why my assumptions would be wrong. 
Make a million dollars, go broke, I really couldn't care less; good luck buddy"
2021-06-09 14:23:18,wallstreetbets,"Right? No matter where you go, most of the time it is a made in china product. What I don't get, is how they have took such a big hit in the last 6 months though; down 43% since they went public. 

I see why people are saying they are undervalued, and they might make a decent jump in the next few weeks. I almost bought some this morning after all the hype.

But then I realized,  in the next month, alot of places are going to be lifting restrictions. Shit, the USA is almost open for business, and here in Canada, alot of restrictions are lifting in the next coming weeks. This Friday Ontario is finally letting non-essential retailers open up. 

I will be watching them though, I think they might be a great play in a couple months after whatever impact they might feel with the reopening of non-essential retailers"
2021-06-09 14:57:25,wallstreetbets,"Market has been hot, ipos even more. They could have slipped under the radar and then shorted by funds for just that reason. 
And no doubt with China shopping there are people with bad experiences that wrongfully blame wish.

I can see lifting restrictions have a lot of impact on travel related sector but retail? I’m not so sure. even more when it comes to specific products or general China products. Most retail stayed open all this time? I really struggle to see what you mean please elaborate because I’m curious if I’m missing something. 
Oh I just see now you’re talking about Canada, I really think the hit would be marginal at most. 
Online shopping has been on steady increase for a while, think all the mall closures.. 
if people can wait to get the product I think many rather buy online than go out of the house and spend more money for a similar product. 
Wish is already a huge player and I think they can leverage in many ways. Good luck!"

25.4 million total shares, 87.8% restricted leaving 3.1 million tradable shares. 

Lol who is this guy? First day on the stock market?

BARK = The Original Bark Company. In case you didn’t know …

This clown is likely looking at the Britain based Barkby group LOL rookie mistake. When we provide ticker names, they are generally US based companies unless we specifically states it’s an international name."

2021-06-09 15:16:19,wallstreetbets,"Yep. That’s why retail traders lose. Wrong information. 

A quick look at their 8K released two days ago…
125 million shares are authorized, 5,561,195 million shares issued, adding to the 19,873,805 million existing Common A shares. Do the math… 25.43 million shares outstanding. 

Take into account the 87.7% held as restricted securities, you’re left with 3.1 million shares trading. 

Come on dude, if you want to go against Bloomberg, you may want some better software than Market Watch lol thanks for the laugh."

2021-06-09 12:55:03,wallstreetbets,This is a tough one. Looks like it coming into a descending pennant as momentum is shifting downward in all timeframe candles. About a 50% chance it goes down instead of up.
2021-06-09 13:12:48,wallstreetbets,Pennant or pennies.
2021-06-09 19:25:42,wallstreetbets,"Weird, your bottom line looks nothing like the horizontal line pennant has. If anything it's a symmetrical triangle on your example"

2021-06-09 13:08:09,wallstreetbets,ROE is growing and looks to be over Key 10% threshold this year!
2021-06-09 13:55:26,wallstreetbets,"I agree. HUYA is going to be HUGEA in my honest opinion. It is one of many undervalued small to midcap innovative Chinese tech companies that could easily be valued at over 25 billion USD and I wouldn't be surprised. There's the country risk that everyone talks about, but that's the whole reason companies like it are undervalued. High risk very high reward. Not just HUYA. Look at WIMI, ZEPP, DOYU, JKS, JWEL, IFBD, MOMO, BLCT, MKD, etc. A ton of cheap innovation with high gains potential. There could be a smear campaign going on to keep these shares cheap long enough for rich connected folk to get all their money in. It obviously isn't a certainty, but worth the gamble if you ask me."
2021-06-09 13:03:24,wallstreetbets,Also TENCENT is their major backer

2021-06-09 12:56:31,wallstreetbets,Where are you getting this 70% short number?
2021-06-09 13:01:49,wallstreetbets,China gaming co? No thanks
2021-06-09 12:59:34,wallstreetbets,I’ve followed it myself since the spike to 30+ and use that with the bi monthly short reports and a company called Ortex data.
2021-06-09 13:02:22,wallstreetbets,Why not? They are literally the hottest growing market for gaming in the world and it’s not even close.
2021-06-09 13:07:26,wallstreetbets,Can you send Ortex’s data? The bimonthly reports have closer to 10% short interest than your figure.
2021-06-09 13:34:37,wallstreetbets,Zero faith in their numbers
2021-06-09 13:08:37,wallstreetbets,You’re looking at outstanding shares. You need to look at the float.
2021-06-09 13:10:34,wallstreetbets,Says 30% on ORTEC as of mid May - not saying this is a bad contender just trying to understand where your figure was sourced - 70% is all my chips in
2021-06-09 12:54:54,wallstreetbets,I’m missing the logic here.. steel is hardly a perfect substitute for timber lol

$CLOV is a good buy. I’m not missing the boat (or rocket or whatever we want to call it) on this one.

2021-06-09 15:35:14,wallstreetbets,"I didn't buy the dip but I didn't sell either. HOLD

 Little nervous nobody is talking about it today but I fucked up and sold AMC at $31 and the next day it was $70 peak so I don't wanna live with ragrets again."
2021-06-09 13:25:31,wallstreetbets,CLOV is still very affordable given where we're going. CLOV investors held strong today and bought the dip. We're in really great shape going forward and the next several weeks will be crazy.
2021-06-09 16:01:01,wallstreetbets,"Agree with you. I am holding until $50 (mental goal) squeeze or not. Humana's and UHGs of the world are trading at $400+. Yes, the size isn't comparable, but revenue is not what matters - in 3 years, CLOV has a good potential for similar EPS. HOLD! Mark my words."
2021-06-09 15:53:15,wallstreetbets,"I bought 100 shares @10.05, bought 100 more at the dip. Learned my lesson selling off AMC too early, and I’m hodling this one until it hits the moon 🌙"

2021-06-09 19:50:58,wallstreetbets,Clov is owned by citadel. Literally the company we were trying to bring down for shorting GME. Clov is definitely an attempt to bring people away from gme and amc

One of the reason for the spike in the last two days. Regardless, the shorts have to cover for this eventually.

Also, the best explanation for gamma squeeze on $CLOV: https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/nw9qd1/massive\_gamma\_squeeze\_incoming/"

2021-06-09 14:52:21,wallstreetbets,"I bought at 24. I hold cryptos, so being down -13% is nothing to me at this point. If you’ve HODL cryptos, you’ll understand where I’m coming from."

2021-06-09 13:25:08,wallstreetbets,"Feeling like the ""institution ownership"" is FUD. Maybe not malicious FUD, but just misunderstanding. I saw a graphic someone posted -the only one I've seen to date- that had institutions owning like 65%; the thing is, it was misleading because ETrade, Ameritrade, Robinhood, etc were classified as ""institutions."""
2021-06-09 12:53:37,wallstreetbets,"THIS JUST IN:  
Citadel owning CLOV is fud… they own less than 0.05% of the float and have 6m calls and 3m puts.  
More than likely that they have a massive short position too seeing as they paid Hindenturd to write fake short reports the past 2 months."

Index funds will start buying soon as this will get added to the Russell 2000. No debt, institutions will be fucking idiots is they sell this before the short squeeze. I can see them selling at $200"
2021-06-09 12:46:07,wallstreetbets,"if that were true we would see the change in ownership to the apes lol every sell was bought by someone else. there's a limit to how much a single entity can dump. besides, every company will have that including the squizzozzle companies. AMC execs literally dumped shares mid squizzozz"
2021-06-09 12:47:26,wallstreetbets,"At the end of the day, the institutions are still investors who want to make money. If the institutions deem that there is a potential short squeeze coming, they will hold. However, most obviously, they will pull out at the top of the squeeze. Thus, institutional ownership won't necessarily prevent a short squeeze from happening; however, there is a potential for a big sell off at the top. You just have to exit according to your stop loss or target price strategy."
2021-06-09 12:56:49,wallstreetbets,AMC is up a gazillion %. What do you mean
2021-06-09 18:19:34,wallstreetbets,"Well according to the institutional ownership list, Greenoaks has 64% of the shares and Citadel has less than 0.5%."
2021-06-09 19:06:33,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly what I mean. Your holdings are not the only talk of the town sir, there are 10 million people in this group. Is it actually surprising to you that people have ideas other than the one you’re following? Cmon bud."

2021-06-09 17:04:06,wallstreetbets,Danm right. I've been through the gme/amc run and missed on multiple opportunities. I'm not bailing till we hit $100.
2021-06-09 12:54:10,wallstreetbets,Private parts it is
2021-06-09 16:42:31,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I’ll give you my support of only $10k."
2021-06-09 12:53:15,wallstreetbets,"AMC short squeeze has not happened yet. It's okay for the executives to sell their shares as long as it's helping the company we all own, which it is. AMC is 85% owned by retail at this point. You can't really compare any of these to what AMC is doing."
2021-06-09 13:21:06,wallstreetbets,He's bag holding
2021-06-09 15:10:12,wallstreetbets,Big difference between pump and dump and some shorts covering and buy and holding at high levels and HFS getting margin called and the price mooning. We havent seen this yet with either GME or AMC.
2021-06-09 13:10:04,wallstreetbets,Yeah but none of the shorts have been covered yet.
2021-06-09 18:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Well, I mistrust that company more than 99.5% of the time so I'll take my chances and say there's something going on there. They don't invest into anything without a plan; they will always get something out of it. At this time, there is 0 transparency on how much Citadel speaks with CLOV. For all we know, they could have employees talking to each other all the time. Again, even if it is small, they aren't stupid and will most likely benefit from this.   


Robinhood on the other hand...that is scary"
2021-06-09 12:58:30,wallstreetbets,Yeah I sold my calls this am for 2000% gain. Bought puts. They’re up now as well

2021-06-09 17:59:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah... so what? When GME first got it's squeeze on January, all the new reddit accounts were hyping AMC. Look where it's at now."
2021-06-09 18:05:11,wallstreetbets,no one cares -
2021-06-09 15:12:19,wallstreetbets,I am sure this will get more hate as it moves up in the upvotes.

2021-06-09 19:00:43,wallstreetbets,"I agree with the fact nobody needs to try and shit on each other’s picks and holdings. We’re seeing way too much of this these last couple weeks. But also, CLOV isn’t just hopes and dreams. It’s still up a shit ton and is also still right at previous all time highs. This has made a lot of money for people and still has a ton of room to grow, it was almost $29 in premarket. I’m holding my 200 shares @ $20 avg cost. I have good faith we’ll be back in the green tomorrow with positive inflation sentiment. If bad sentiment about inflation, we’re ALL gonna be in the rough tomorrow."
2021-06-09 19:58:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah-true about AMC! 

Bummed about what happened with CLOV today but had much less money in since I am just learning so I've hardly lost anything except big %s not a lot of actual money."

2021-06-09 13:53:14,wallstreetbets,AMC isn’t going to squeeze lol and if it happens it’s mostly retail investors that’s gonna get hurt. Short interest has been decreasing so it’s basically gonna stay flat or until people start selling and it cascades down
2021-06-09 14:54:21,wallstreetbets,"Lol you think those guys are diluting to help the company? Wake up retard, they’re dumping shares to line their pockets. They don’t give a fuck."

2021-06-09 18:00:51,wallstreetbets,Except this one is a concerted effort by their subreddit to use WSB popularity to make a quick pump and dump. AMC made far more sense as pandemic came to close it would not only pick up by it was being shorted fierce. 2 very different situations.

2021-06-09 14:56:42,wallstreetbets,"I guess I'll have to find that out for myself. Maybe you're not wrong, I hope you are. I'm gonna hold on to my AMC tho, just in case."
2021-06-09 18:55:30,wallstreetbets,"Sure clov is undervalued fundamentally but you'll see for yourself once it get squeezed then returns to 10ish levels then will take months to grow in value.This wasn't meant on clov specifically, it's just it's hard to see so many stocks being pumped to expect them all to get the squeeze they deserve. There's too much greed and dilution, bit for those with good timing, good for you."

2021-06-09 16:03:32,wallstreetbets,Man I’m asking myself the same question. Some people on here rather you bag hold and post loss porn so they can enjoy their own gains. The only way to ensure not to be a bag holder is to secure profits. Seems that doesn’t register here lol
2021-06-09 18:04:35,wallstreetbets,Ive said yeah man.. reading an actual sentence exist to ! Ive read the link when he sent it to me the first time and said yeah man ! Yeah man !
2021-06-09 18:05:34,wallstreetbets,Except AMC is only 20% short and that's literally the only reason people are even pumping it I kid you not. Just turn off your brain and go ape otherwise nothing makes sense here.
2021-06-09 13:04:34,wallstreetbets,"A few million apes can most definitely destroy Wall Street's elites, and it is quite satisfying to watch."
2021-06-09 14:56:59,wallstreetbets,"Imagine, classifying being up 415% as not a squeeze. How deluded are you? Lemme guess, you want AMC to be at $1,000 a share right, which would be a 11,000%+ increase from three months ago."
2021-06-09 14:57:32,wallstreetbets,I’m not telling you to sell at all bro.

2021-06-09 12:37:40,wallstreetbets,"yeah I think that is what will end up happening. FOMO will kick in by a lot of investors, and this will get driven up even higher. As long as it remains above the critical MA's, then on the technical levels we will see higher highs, perhaps even higher than what we saw in February."
2021-06-09 15:00:51,wallstreetbets,"Damn, im not going to lie. It’s one thing to short a stock and sit there quietly while u launch short attacks like some did to gme/amc/etc. but its another to short a stock and shit post them with personal attacks, especially mocking them for having fatal crashes. Thats a huge slap in the fucking face to any test-pilot that pursues a greater cause for advancement. HUGE. 

This makes me want to buy more. And i was already sitting pretty on a 80% gain."
2021-06-09 13:11:31,wallstreetbets,"Dates that have been floated around are July 4 and July 18 (Branson's birthday). They hold their cards pretty close on announcing those dates until they're fully locked in. Buy the rumor, sell the news

2021-06-09 12:43:31,wallstreetbets,"This is what they what. They want to distract from GME & AMC with other meme stocks, hoping people will sell out their GME & AMC shares to buy into CLOV, etc. Then trying to cause friction between every group. 

I hope everyone is still holding GME & AMC, buying into CLOV, UWMC, BB, CLNE, IVR, etc. making big gains and then buying GME & AMC with the profits. I want to squeeze to Pluto here."
2021-06-09 12:37:29,wallstreetbets,"Only problem with CLOV is Citadel........ to be fair its the same mm hf AMC and GME have issues with.

But, they are wildly different issues"
2021-06-09 12:48:49,wallstreetbets,"Clov, wkhs, and Wendy’s now apparently, are pump and dumps with an institutional majority ownership. They’re distractions to redirect focus from gme and amc which have a vast majority retail ownership. There’s no chance of a legit short squeeze in those stocks because the hedge funds are helping to drive the price up to dump it later for a big profit to help cover their losses in amc and GME. They know what people on this page are doing and saying and are manipulating it. Every time amc or gme starts rallying, here come the bots and new or rarely active accounts spamming with other stocks GameStop and gme are proven retail driven with potential for massive profits while the others are driven by institutions looking to cash in on retail investor enthusiasm and distraction. Sure, you can make damn good profits in those stocks as long as you get out before the hedges dump them but they pale in comparison to the profits that’ll be realized when the shorts are forced to cover in amc and gme, something that keeps getting pushed further and further down the road because people keep getting distracted by the shiny new thing the institutional investors put in front of them"
2021-06-09 14:16:17,wallstreetbets,Hedge Funds using their stocktwits accounts and discord groups to divide and conquer.
2021-06-09 14:24:27,wallstreetbets,"I’ve got AMC and I’ve got CLOV... but definitely more focused on CLOV working for the masses of retail investors. 
There is a reason why retail investors are in the mainstream media and why some of the stocks discussed here have charts that look like hockey sticks when you look at a chart spanning more than a week or two. Whether you have a few hundred or a few thousand to throw at it... gains are gains. (But, as optimistic as I am, don’t cash out your retirement to put in this one stock, CLOV, or any one single stock.)"
2021-06-09 12:59:29,wallstreetbets,AMC and GME are the real play until the squeeze takes places. Other tickers are distraction until then.
2021-06-09 12:38:47,wallstreetbets,Bruh you can not compare clov to gme wtf are you on😂
2021-06-09 12:47:27,wallstreetbets,Because people invested in amc or gme purely in it because they fomo’d … don’t have enough to diversify .. and wanna see there own pockets fatten .. it’s that simple really
2021-06-09 12:36:20,wallstreetbets,"AMC and GME, BB  are the real plays here, others just a destraction IMO, they will be forgotten a few days from now."
2021-06-09 13:25:12,wallstreetbets,AMC is an impostor.  They attack anyone not buying AMC or if you buy more GME.   Board is toxic.
2021-06-09 12:39:00,wallstreetbets,We are spreading ourselves to thin. People going to clov is ruining our movement for our generation and the next . This will go down in history books if we can pick them off 1 or 2 stocks at a time . They just jumped to clov way to soon . Same thing happen in January with GME people went to amc and spread ourselves to thin now we have 3 stocks .. 3 months later we will have 4 stocks . We let the hedge funds plan and react like this . This movement is dead if we don’t use our numbers
2021-06-09 12:34:06,wallstreetbets,AMC ALL THE WAY...FUCK CLOV
2021-06-09 12:35:24,wallstreetbets,"You want value? You want Deep Fucking Value?? GME is THE stock.. always has been, always will be.. Mr. Burry even said that there would never be a setup like this again."
2021-06-09 12:46:22,wallstreetbets,Those that join late want to get picked up. CLOV and AMC both can go up. No reason to hate.
2021-06-09 13:30:59,wallstreetbets,"I agree, there’s a lot of despondency between us apes and what retail stocks we’re all focusing on. I figured the original 3 was AMC, GME, and BB. All of a sudden we’ve got CLOV, CLNE, even a few others out of left field being pushed. Apes stronger together 🦧🏝🦧"
2021-06-09 12:34:19,wallstreetbets,From what I’ve seen (haven’t been able to confirm it myself) citadel is heavily invested in CLOV so by buying into it you are giving the HF more money to fight off the squeeze
2021-06-09 14:00:01,wallstreetbets,"Because they are diluting interest in the stock. They are literally the SHF's wet dream, doing it for FREE. Fuck that."

2021-06-09 13:19:54,wallstreetbets,True but we are trying to make money and being divided doesn’t help us lower class
2021-06-09 13:04:54,wallstreetbets,All my dollahs are at the movies. 🦍🍿🚀🌛.
2021-06-09 12:48:51,wallstreetbets,"agreed. AMC today is looking a lil shady...but she’ll bounce back. I have some in BB as well, but will take profits when needed to sink more into AMC. Lets get this $$$ apes!🚀"
2021-06-09 13:35:30,wallstreetbets,Hope so or we’re all gonna bleed
2021-06-09 15:28:34,wallstreetbets,Or they want everyone to keep their money in amc and gme while making money on other stocks...
2021-06-09 12:40:52,wallstreetbets,Citadel is bearish on CLOV so not sure what’re you talking about.
2021-06-09 13:34:39,wallstreetbets,Right I agree with this guy amc gme!!
2021-06-09 14:18:34,wallstreetbets,I’d say it’s the new investors with dumb tactics lol they  seemed to have this idea if you bad mouth one stock the money leaving would plow into theirs. Very odd strategy
2021-06-09 14:25:49,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
2021-06-09 13:01:03,wallstreetbets,Negative. I could make a case for CLOV being a better squeeze potential than AMC both gamma+short.
2021-06-09 13:06:09,wallstreetbets,Gme is at $300+ the squeeze has already taken place lmao
2021-06-09 13:36:22,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-09 12:49:24,wallstreetbets,Thus.
2021-06-09 13:21:26,wallstreetbets,No we want to make money so we can diversify but clov do your research before investing. its just a bad call I’ll continue to scalp it from your bad decisions
2021-06-09 12:38:23,wallstreetbets,"AMC GME B..B! THOSE THE THREE! 

I made a little song"
2021-06-09 13:33:06,wallstreetbets,"150% return from clov does not sound distracting, in that same time GME only moved around 25%. Can’t hate on people for chasing gainzzz."
2021-06-09 12:48:31,wallstreetbets,Bruh it's the stock market not a movement. We're here to make money. You guys are so cringe.
2021-06-09 12:39:06,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you, man"
2021-06-09 12:37:49,wallstreetbets,Burry who’s a bear? Lol
2021-06-09 13:22:34,wallstreetbets,">next .

Just spreads us thin that’s all ."
2021-06-09 12:49:36,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, why divide each other and turn one another off from investing in each other? Not smart."
2021-06-09 12:36:29,wallstreetbets,"That’s false. Citadel has 10x more shares of AMC than CLOV. That’s because they’re the market makers for Robinhood and are forced to purchase 100 shares for every put option they sell. That’s actually very bearish, in fact that’s how gamma squeezes are created."
2021-06-09 13:22:18,wallstreetbets,It's as if they expect people to actually yeet everything into only 2 stocks. Diversify bitches.
2021-06-09 13:26:10,wallstreetbets,AMC looks like a bunch of toxic wannabe traders on their boards.  Not like GME.
2021-06-09 14:12:28,wallstreetbets,Tis nothing more than a scratch my fellow Ape.
2021-06-09 12:42:12,wallstreetbets,Citadel is the MM for Clov
2021-06-09 14:29:51,wallstreetbets,Maybe! As if there are only two stocks in the whole market.
2021-06-09 13:24:14,wallstreetbets,"Should diversify before throwing all eggs in one basket. A bad call yet people are up some 30%
.. profit is profit…. If people wanna get in and out no harm. As long as everyone’s making money I see no point in everybody telling others to only buy one thing …"
2021-06-09 13:02:36,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't make anybody ""cringe"" that they have more in mind for their investments than just making money. If we keep letting the hedge funds run the market like this, it won't be long before we won't have a market to invest in anymore. If you don't find that's your weight to bare, that's fine but don't down other people for trying to make the stock market a fair playing field. That's what's cringe."
2021-06-09 13:17:11,wallstreetbets,You realize we don’t make money if we don’t stick together right ? Yes it’s a movement So us low and middle class can have a shot at making the money . That saying rich get richer . Well how about us too ?
2021-06-09 12:38:41,wallstreetbets,You must be new my fellow ape
2021-06-09 13:26:13,wallstreetbets,"But, it doesn't. They are all their for taking."
2021-06-09 12:53:17,wallstreetbets,"I'm new around here. Trying to get a feel of the place. Seems to me people get into stocks early and then try to convince others to join. Those others themselves missed the big moon ride, and want a new stock to moon thinking those two are old news.

Basically, don't overthink it, just eat a banana."
2021-06-09 13:07:54,wallstreetbets,AMC is around 80% retail now.
2021-06-09 13:47:24,wallstreetbets,Problem is what is going to come next? More and more keep popping up and thus it's spreading everyone's money into different places. It's diluting the cause. How you going to squeeze something if you keep buying others...
2021-06-09 13:27:57,wallstreetbets,lol not everyone is toxic. just a shame with all these other petty stocks being used as a distraction tbh. AMC blew up and we are crashing and burning each other to the ground when we could easily just unite.
2021-06-09 14:34:43,wallstreetbets,Exactly we can attack short sellers from all directions.
2021-06-09 18:47:41,wallstreetbets,Yeah how did that knowledge turn out for you today ? we all knew this was going to happen you guys should diversify away from ClOV you picked the wrong stock . Just helped those dudes get more money to screw the other stocks . Great work
2021-06-09 13:35:14,wallstreetbets,The game will always be rigged against us. You need to figure out how to beat it.
2021-06-09 13:34:10,wallstreetbets,Sticking together would classify as a pump and dump. We share stocks we like here...
2021-06-09 13:09:49,wallstreetbets,Hmm not when the amc management keeps diluting and plans to dilute more as they continue to sell to the hedges.
2021-06-09 14:27:10,wallstreetbets,GME is the way.
2021-06-09 18:49:38,wallstreetbets,I bought more. More of this and more of other stocks i hold. Hopefully it dips a bit more soo I can get more on sale. Same with amc . The longer it is on sale the better. I’ll buy when I can. Could both be red till end of year and I’ll still add to the position. Invest what you can afford to lose right
2021-06-09 14:54:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's what we're trying to do, so, I don't know, I just feel like we all need each other right now. The amount of disinformation that flies around about every single little thing really requires dedication."
2021-06-09 13:12:31,wallstreetbets,"That's not what's happening. This was all part of a deal that finalized in April, and now they are selling off their shares to cut down on debt. And of course, there's probably employees that are selling for a profit, which is fine, that's their prerogative, but not to dilute the market."
2021-06-09 13:15:02,wallstreetbets,"Go read their SEC filings, and their future plans for the shares. I lowered my position on AMC after reading it, crooked management. At one point they had a discussion to give each other 11.5 million shares as bonus 🤦🏻‍♂️"
2021-06-09 13:51:53,wallstreetbets,"I don't see anywhere in any of the SEC filings where it says they're giving each other 11.5 million shares as bonuses. I know that there was one employee that had 11.5 million shares a couple of weeks back and they sold it, but reading through the filings, I don't really see a problem at all. I see a CEO that's interested in getting back on track."
2021-06-09 14:37:56,wallstreetbets,"I've held a large position of my portfolio in sens for months now.  I truly believe in a long term appeal to the stock hence why I've been buying shares.  They have a superior product to their competition further their main competition trades ridiculously high DXCM 392.15 as of this typing.  It is also a ""feel good"" company to invest in as they are making products that improve their users quality of life.  A possible squeeze play is just a added bonus to my already high opinion of the company.  I see both long and short term appeal to the company."
2021-06-09 16:10:45,wallstreetbets,I’m in for $20K at an average price of $2.26 proud 🦍 and owner of 8100 shares
2021-06-09 12:34:13,wallstreetbets,I'm in for 10 big ones.

2021-06-09 13:08:55,wallstreetbets,"You son of a bitch, I’m in."
2021-06-09 13:08:55,wallstreetbets,I think we'll see some weak resistance around 3.80 but then easy to the 4.7 - 5 range
2021-06-09 13:00:49,wallstreetbets,"Why does my post formatting keeps changing fuck, now the pictures are just links help"
2021-06-09 12:48:41,wallstreetbets,I'm in but very conservatively. You didn't use a SINGLE rocket emoji.
2021-06-09 12:35:31,wallstreetbets,lowkey feel bad for the ppl not in $WISH rn
2021-06-09 12:44:42,wallstreetbets,10k? I wish I had that to put in
2021-06-09 12:48:15,wallstreetbets,"Please read at least the fundamental parts and dont yolo in life savings haha, it's actually surprising how good this company has toughed out. It's very hard for small cap biotech companies to stay afloat, and we have a good one here."
2021-06-09 13:32:35,wallstreetbets,fluttering around 3.3 right now. think it'll break through soon? is there any catalyst coming up?
2021-06-09 12:53:46,wallstreetbets,Will update post now that I'm on mobile with emojis then!!
2021-06-09 12:45:06,wallstreetbets,"I dont know, I feel if they didnt get in early yesterday they missed quite a bit"
2021-06-09 14:45:42,wallstreetbets,This aged well lol
2021-06-09 12:59:56,wallstreetbets,10 shares lol.  I basically put it on my watch closely list.
2021-06-09 13:13:02,wallstreetbets,"Wendy’s has me with a nice amount to play with, apes rise"
2021-06-09 13:51:03,wallstreetbets,"We're early on it, and the closest calls expire June 18 so still got a good time to for options and they're dirt cheap lol"
2021-06-09 13:45:29,wallstreetbets,"If you look at the charts you'll see that 3.3 is the area of support. The catalyst would be WSB and other retail investors getting on it aswell so we can squeeze the shorts. We need this post to reach the top basically.

But SENS is still cheap and IV% is low from the get go so people should try to find the next squeeze after WISH and now CLF lol. Maybe tomorrow when people celebrate GME and their CLF gains lol"
2021-06-09 15:02:07,wallstreetbets,Clov to the moon
2021-06-09 12:31:22,wallstreetbets,"So they shorted CLOV at $27, a stock that was like $8 not too long ago

I'm failing to see the problem here"

2021-06-09 12:39:10,wallstreetbets,The Hedgies played you bro...
2021-06-09 12:43:34,wallstreetbets,Looks like you're karma is too low to reply to your own thread. I'll say this. You are implying this is all a ruse from the shorts to drive down the price. You implied the stock dropped simply because more shorts were added this week. Maybe the shorts have been playing this game longer than you or I and realize what goes up must come down and shorted near the top
2021-06-09 12:34:08,wallstreetbets,RIGHT LMAO
2021-06-09 12:36:35,wallstreetbets,I mean it makes sense to short a stock that rises so drastically. The shorts arent driving the price down. the bag holders that bought in at $12 then watched it go down to $7 then up over $27 sold to finally realize a profit. Congrats to them they earned it. It was a helluva ride
2021-06-09 12:41:15,wallstreetbets,Most people on here don’t understand the markets. They come here to gamble on speculation
2021-06-09 12:48:12,wallstreetbets,"I was one of those people, but I got off the ride at $17, decided I wasn't being a good ape and bought back in at $27. Brain feeling smooth as glass."
2021-06-09 12:53:19,wallstreetbets,Yikes I can feel that one it's so vivid

2021-06-09 12:28:14,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. People only get mad over pumps if their the ones bagholding. Problem is too many people are buying at the peak after a stock has rallied 50% believing there's going to be a ""short squeeze"""

2021-06-09 12:31:04,wallstreetbets,This. I said on a different post earlier that it feels like we are being pulled in a lot of different directions right now. We don’t even see GME posts on here any more. Last week we had plenty of apes on here behind BB but they have all disappeared. I’m still holding CLNE and I’m sticking to BB & GME. Keep those 💎 🙌 strong fellow apes!
2021-06-09 12:33:14,wallstreetbets,"Theres a ton of noise I agree, but baby apes need CLNE and BB plays to get our chance too. Barriers to entry or some shit like that. Do we need to consolidate around a handful sure, but we know who the big apes are. Always respect to our forefathers on the AMC/GME diamond hold. but also dont listen to me I drink Palmolive and can't wipe my own ass."

""We"" aren't a thing. I never signed up for ""we."" I signed up to get a feel for market tendencies, make tendies, and buy lambos. How some retards on this sub choose to invest is there business. I don't think half the people on this sub know what they're even doing, so I just disregard. There are good plays and there are bad plays. It's each individual's job to figure out which those are.

WSB is not financial advice, nor a collective, nor a democracy."
2021-06-09 13:07:23,wallstreetbets,"Gme and amc all the way! I'm very happy with my huge returns and they are only looking tastier. To me all the other ""meme stocks"" are misdirection. Take clove and wendys for example, big hedge funds jump on early positions and then bots start spamming it in here. Then they post on the news that it's trending on web. It's a misdirection to splinter new apes away from the cause. And I guarantee you that they will all sell of at the same time and leave you holding the bag.

New people to this site, you better be very cautious"
2021-06-09 13:14:55,wallstreetbets,How are you holding CLNE at a massive loss? Its at like $13 rn. Its been between $9 and $10 for weeks. Really curious about this apes cost basis

2021-06-09 12:53:01,wallstreetbets,Cmon mate this is literally what I was complaining about up above hahah. I respect the grind in finding these stocks but we really need to consolidate around the current plays we have instead of branching out to new ones. Thanks for the heads up though will definitely look into it if it gains some momentum on the subreddit
2021-06-09 12:58:35,wallstreetbets,"Well you're not wrong but I think its dumb to think anyone making any plays on this subreddit are using valuations or logic including those who ""know"" what they're doing. We're obviously throwing money at already inflated stocks in the hope that more of our autists band and pump it even higher. There may be good plays here but without the momentum they're all overvalued junk anyway. You can say we're not a collective or a democracy but buddy the only way we're all making money here is if we combine our pea sized brains just like the asses at wall street do when they manipulate the markets. Yeah they're going to see everything we plan in here and try to counter us but we've got 10 million hands here with more capital in the back. The only we can win is together"

2021-06-09 13:45:11,wallstreetbets,"I think it's more along the lines of when we band together we have more money collectively to throw in one place, but now we're dividing our collective input and it's making us weaker as a whole. Amc is not done. People keep chasing pumps trying to get rich, and ultimately that isn't what this movement is about. I'm relatively new to reddit, but I've joined this movement because I believe in the principle behind it. I'm not trying to go against any OG's here, but I think it's pretty obvious that if we all put our money towards one, or two, or even three of these meme stocks it will ultimately be better than everyone branching off to try and squeeze the whole market. This will probably be removed by a mod because imma noob here, but I wanted to at least try to put it in perspective."

To answer your question before WSB got ahold of it no. 28-30 EOY was the thesis and if steel prices remained high in 2022 add another 10. Thats still a 40-50% return for most people who got in on this earlier in the year for commons 100-200% for leaps."

Lita's of babies will be made. Lots of new house hold formation. Lots of houses since we have been under building for ten years and have  incredibly low inventory. EV pushing up copper. Inflation going from a 1.5-2% run rate in 2010-2019 to 2.5-3% plus in 2020-2029. Also why do prices have to come down just because the RATE of inflation comes down? Why wouldn't producers just keep the price steady and increase their margins? Wage inflation is here people can afford to pay high prices. I'm thinking a portfolio of 5 stocks is all you need for this next cycle."

2021-06-09 16:19:44,wallstreetbets,"You will need to find the right alloy... Which means expensive.

You are probably using standard 304 stainless.

Most pharma manufacturing equipment is 316.

Maybe try asking on a civil engineering subreddit.

Maybe Hastelloy would work, but it isn't a steel and it is awfully expensive."
2021-06-09 18:44:56,wallstreetbets,does it have to be stainless? can you use galvanized?

2021-06-09 19:39:21,wallstreetbets,"So galvanized corrodes in salt air because the protective coating ""sacrifices"" itself...but it is stronger than stainless so for docks and decks, we use galvanized bolts and replace ever 10-15 years. But screws in poly furniture, we have good stainless screws and then there is bad stainless screws...depends on company. Grills, outdoor kitchen equipment...same thing...if good SS it will last 10-15 years...crap stainless @ 6mos. Fish cleaning sink.... maybe 2 years, faucet 1 yr."

Just not sure if I hold out on all my contracts for CLNE, or if I should sell atleast one or two of the profits I can right now and leave my $12 and $13 contracts in for later."

Further, you can calculate how much money you’d make by exercising, and compare it to how much money you’d make by selling the contract, and if I were you I’d go with the more money scenario"
2021-06-09 12:24:14,wallstreetbets,Good luck!! I'm rooting for you
2021-06-09 14:05:15,wallstreetbets,"I figured it was an easy as my math was.  Also, exercising would require you having the funds to cover the shares, which I am sure not everyone has on hand."

Then once their connected vehicle app system starts getting popular they should make plenty of money, that is if Amazon doesn't take too large a chunk of the profits. The news is nice, will give BB a boost in stock price for a bit then I'm sure it'll stagnate. Probably better to hold for the long game tho for when they start raking in the app money"

I started investing a little at a time on Robinhood in mostly ""safe"" things but I'm not brave or reckless enough to sink all or even most of my savings into something with a risk of losing. 

I would covet any advice. I'm still learning."

2021-06-09 19:54:58,wallstreetbets,It’s not their phone. The tech radar article is a fud. Blackberry is only licensing them their keyboard and software. Blackberry does not make phones!
2021-06-09 17:14:14,wallstreetbets,At least 420
2021-06-09 18:11:20,wallstreetbets,Well see a drop to about 6 to 9 dollars and hopefully a jump from 4 to 20
2021-06-09 15:49:35,wallstreetbets,"Because there's a filtered water cooler next door named QNX.

Software and services have way better margins.  Besides, Mike and Jim fucked up the phone sales by thinking too much like carriers (and hiring carrier execs)."

2021-06-09 14:39:59,wallstreetbets,Yes sir I am retarded
2021-06-09 19:55:05,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.  Like on Monday, I bought a $clov call option and Tuesday morning I was SOOOO happy to finally break the thousand barrier on my account… only for it to dip.  Then I got paper hands and sold after I was back in the 700s.  

Today, I had 850 at open, but because I listened to retards on here, I lost almost half of that by close.  I know that’s the game, and that stocks go up and down, but damn if it just doesn’t seem too coincidental that MOST of the time when I try to get on a hype train, its almost always way too late.

AMC is another good one.  Got in too late, but made a good profit… at first.  I listened to all of the baghol… erm, I mean, diamond-handed hodlers and my profit went up in smoke.  My call on AMC is literal shit right now.

Ugh…"

Hell, even venerable Tanium was better than Cylance.  Endgame, Carbon Black, Cynet (out of Israel) are all using AI/Machine learning. IBM's Internet Security Systems were doing machine learning on the content side with the German acquisition of Cobion.  That was back in the late 2000's.

Does BB have room to take advantage of the space? Absoutely.  Are they the best things since sliced bread and the AI pioneer that you're claiming that they are?  Not even close.  You can do you own searching for Cylance."

[here is news](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity)

If IBM has the best security Ai then why they decided to sell blackberry cylance/protect instead?  
[here is the news](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-and-ibm-canada-establish-a-new-partnership)

if IBM security is better why they using blackberry in their IBM 360 SOC product? why not use IBM's security?

If blackberry cylance or blackberry protect is not the top best security. how is it able to predict ransomware 5 years in advance?  darkside predicted by their ai model 5 years ago!!

2021-06-09 12:30:24,wallstreetbets,Let’s go as a die hard Ford fan and owner let’s show the American F some respect.
2021-06-09 12:43:57,wallstreetbets,"Did you seriously forget the new Ford lightning full electric truck, and the just revealed Ford Mavrick hybrid truck (40MPG, 4K lbs tow capacity, $20K starting price)?"
2021-06-09 12:11:46,wallstreetbets,Love it.  Owned Ford for years.  LFG!
2021-06-09 13:08:42,wallstreetbets,My wife's boyfriend is a Chad who doesn't use reddit and has already got stonks in Ford. It looks to be a good move.
2021-06-09 12:11:45,wallstreetbets,The bronco is ass ugly and I don’t think it will do well however the MACH-E and the new Ford lightening I think will.
2021-06-09 12:20:50,wallstreetbets,Ford went from low 11s to 16 in 2 weeks after F150 lighting demo. You missed the play already.
2021-06-09 12:16:36,wallstreetbets,Yo I like Ford but the new bronco is dumb as hell. It looks like a Scion xB and it’s the size of a Mini Cooper.  Ruined.  Fords problem is Ford.
2021-06-09 12:53:23,wallstreetbets,"I like Ford, but they have a major chip / production problem right now.  Methinks the company said it will cost them $2B in missed profit this year."
2021-06-09 15:37:51,wallstreetbets,I mean if Ford is in my “diversified” portfolio. Idk if it will ever be a short term yolo but hey I never planned to sell my position in Ford anyway.
2021-06-09 17:25:06,wallstreetbets,"I never-ever would have considered $F until just recently. I think going electric is going to be very good for the company.  But, I question whether or not they will rise as fast as other opportunities this group is known for.  I bought a good sized chunk of $F (and then wrote call options against the positions) after they did their electric truck rollout, but I’m still more enthusiastic about some of the other stuff the WSB apes are doing... particularly the stuff the mainstream financial medial has picked up on like CLOV and WEN. Note- I’m not an expert here."
2021-06-09 17:28:19,wallstreetbets,"Jeazusz, don’t say that. I’m in deep on TSLA (since pre-split.. around 2018 or something) Plenty of room for both F and TSLA to grow.   Elon might piss people off, and he may or may not be a good person, but his massive compensation package is directly tied to growth and that matches the goals of TSLA equity holders."
2021-06-09 12:14:05,wallstreetbets,"And, I forgot to mention the recently resealed Ford Maverick, the truck for the ""city guy""."
2021-06-09 12:44:56,wallstreetbets,F
2021-06-09 12:48:19,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I forgot.  How did I?... brain fart day."
2021-06-09 12:17:17,wallstreetbets,"Considering they can’t keep up with the number of Bronco pre-orders, I think it will do just fine."
2021-06-09 12:17:36,wallstreetbets,Mach-e is the ugliest version of a rav4 I’ve seen yet tho.
2021-06-09 12:29:26,wallstreetbets,"It's literally a redux of the 1966 bronco which was also boxy and compact.  The Bronco didn't hop on an F series chassis until 1978.  While that second generation (78-79) is my favorite, the first gen broncos bring a mint on the collector market.  That's in spite of the first gen being sold nearly unchanged for over a decade."
2021-06-09 13:02:19,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, so we wait for the dip and take it to the next level."
2021-06-09 19:20:11,wallstreetbets,The great thing about $F tho is how cheap the options are(LEAPs in particular).
2021-06-09 13:29:03,wallstreetbets,Ford is going to make an fuckload of money with the new Maverick.
2021-06-09 12:53:50,wallstreetbets,That's ok.  Just continue your diet of glue dipped crayons and keep smiling.
2021-06-09 15:39:53,wallstreetbets,The Bronco wont be a long production run anyway. Now that the auto industry has tracked what happened with cars like the H2 Hummer they do things like the Bronco as temporary runs while the hype is strong.
2021-06-09 19:05:21,wallstreetbets,Im sure the bag holders from 1999 wont mind.
2021-06-09 12:11:07,wallstreetbets,You know what. I'm in. +264 shares.
2021-06-09 12:09:10,wallstreetbets,"Not sure what charging network means but have you seen Tesla charging network?

2021-06-09 12:13:56,wallstreetbets,"There’s a company that has charging stations and doesn’t make that much profit.

This is more of a strategic positioning of market share on charging points. 

There won’t be much profit in charging unless they up the rates to same like gasoline price."

2021-06-09 16:31:28,wallstreetbets,"They can flex their charging locations.

If it takes minimum 20-30 min to charge your car for 200 miles-ish of range, it encourages the return of old style diners, cafes, and coffee shops.

The charging itself is a negligible return. The renting of real estate to star bucks, clean bathrooms, cafes, diners, book stores, etc coupled with secure Wifi... This is where profit will be generated"

2021-06-09 19:39:17,wallstreetbets,It’s a SaaS model. Service subscriptions are the play with charging stations.
2021-06-09 16:43:48,wallstreetbets,"By the time they rolled this out and there’s enough ICE to EV conversion the battery tech would have changed to solid state where the charge time and capacity is 10 times better. 

In order for people to convert from ICE to EV time and range must be same if not better than gasoline."
2021-06-09 14:11:39,wallstreetbets,"My comment stands. So because one dealership will sell you a Ford truck and then sell and install an XL conversion, it means Ford is partnered with XL? Am I missing something on that page?"
