03/17/2021,stocks,She is religious and discussed it. ARKK is heavy in tech stocks so the dip may have led people to bail more than her religious views IMO but that doesn’t bother me.
03/17/2021,stocks,"The stock market doesn’t care about religion, look at the graphs and make your own decision whether she’s successful. This is like asking if she was black and invested with BLM in mind."
03/17/2021,stocks,What did she say about religion
03/17/2021,stocks,The stock stopped going up
03/17/2021,stocks,first I've heard of it. I'll keep buying the stock.
03/17/2021,stocks,After they realized she might have problems they started looking and found them
03/17/2021,stocks,The problem with ARKK is that it has little to no alpha. It basically tracks with a 2x Nasdaq. If the market turns so will the fund.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yea sentiment immediately turned bearish when she came out. She’s had great performance so far, so whatever she’s doing is working."
03/17/2021,stocks,Curious as well

03/17/2021,stocks,"It depends on the stock and what is happening.  Short term stocks that are pumped will go up farther faster.  In the end when the pumpers cash out the stock will go back down.  The end price will be the same, but  the ride itself would be different.  Shorting a stock doesn't change anything about the fundamentals and the same fundamentals that cause people to short a stock will eventually cause it to eventually go down which is why people shorted it in the first place.  Contrary to the memes people don't short stocks out of spite or to drive them down they short them because the believe they are going to go down anyhow.  Without shorting you will see a lot more pump and dumps and people who get caught up in the memes will lose just as much in the end."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I’m a parent. The owlet was the bane of our existence. As first time parents we wanted our child to be as safe as possible! Owlet sounds good on paper until it doesn’t work the way it should. Imagine sleeping at 3am. And the monitor goes off. Your child stopped breathing. Pure fucking panic. Only it wasn’t that. Your kid just kicked the sock off in it’s sleep. We experienced that maybe 3 times in one week and my wife was ready to lose her mind. 

We took our concern to our pediatrician. She explained it’s a nice sentiment but it’s a piece of technology that works for some but mostly provides more paranoia than comfort for new parents. 

I read up on early reviews too but our experience is less than a year. Figured we would donate it on market place since it was barely used and expensive. We left a description about our issue and no one ever picked it up. For free. Then I looked on market place and searched owlet. Dozens of posts. Disappointed parents, etc. 

Every parent or doctor since that I talked to said it’s a gimmick to rope in new parents. You must not love your kid if you don’t spend $100+ on a sock. Give me a 2 way baby monitor with full lcd screen and a carbon monoxide detector over that any day."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I recommend reading the App Store/Google Play reviews. There are a lot of complaints about the quality and usability of the app and devices, which to me is concerning. Usually you can only thrash your reputation once, as it's hard to come back from it."
03/17/2021,stocks,"^ This. We still use the smart sock but it has it’s glitches. The camera is a piece of shit, we got so frustrated we stopped using it and bought a Eufy."
03/17/2021,stocks,As a parent of 2 and a hypochondriac that would have freaked me out too. We use the two way monitors as well. But SOMEONE is buying their products because they are growing. If they can get a grasp on the type of issues you had with the sock it could really be popular with people especially those with children who have certain health issues. I have also read a lot of good reviews as well as bad ones so it goes both ways
03/17/2021,stocks,Eufy is a great choice. Agreed on camera.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I agree that the financials make it an appealing stock, but I just can’t stand by the product. Turtle Beaches headsets are cheaply made and are not appealing. I’ve also read very negative reviews about their current high end headset that just released. Another reason I decided not to buy in is bc they haven’t tested the water on different PC markets (keyboards, mouses, etc). 7 years ago when I was into gaming, turtle beaches dominated the headset market and they still do but I was disappointed to see that they still only focus on headsets. It does sound like a good short term investment tho"
03/17/2021,stocks,I've had HEAR in my port for like 2 years. Bought more when it dipped to $17ish but sold a lot at $26 and again at $30. I have about 1/2 my original stake remaining.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Did you know that ""A Toyota"" is a palindrome?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I read an article that said Toyota has battery tech that could kneecap Tesla. Toyota has a history of quietly working on stuff and not being public about it. 

About 2 decades ago, a bunch of books came out about Toyota. In the US, we always touted Ford's assembly line. As Toyota became the largest car maker in the world, they invited American auto execs to tour their facilities and they were blown away by their Just In Time manufacturing and it spurred a trend towards ""lean manufacturing"".

I wouldn't be surprised if Toyota steals the crown from Tesla as they start releasing their new models."
03/17/2021,stocks,Proud Camry owner as well so a little bias here lol
03/17/2021,stocks,I've owned domestic trucks for as long as I can remember it wasn't till recently that I got fed up with their garbage. I ended up buying a Tundra and I couldn't be happier. Toyota has a life long customer and actually their service departments are pretty damn good too
03/17/2021,stocks,TM is also the leader in hybrid. There's a lot people not ready to go full electric.
03/17/2021,stocks,VW just announced they’ll be all electric by 2025 too. Haven’t looked at any numbers on them though. Odds are pretty good that in 10 years Tesla will be just another car company.
03/17/2021,stocks,"TM is on my short list.  

They are a solid vehicle manufacturer selling vehicles globally.  This also means that they have a stream of income from the parts market they manufacture as well (at least until the OEM market catches up).  People who buy a Toyota often buy yet another and another.  Brand loyalty is a good thing.  Their vehicles are catered to the markets, such as small diesels in SE Asia, but also not supplying those to the US American market and focusing on gasoline engines. 

But I do not see them growing as phenomenally as Tesla, nor being a Tesla killer.  The Toyota Prius wasn't first to the market, and the plug-in version was a flop.  The Hybrid Prius was great (apart from the battery failures) and used by Steve Wozniak to go 105MPH in his.

Here's the reasons why NOT to buy them:

* Slow to capitalize on innovation such as electric cars and an autopilot
* Lack of breadth, TSLA has SpaceX, Solar City and the Boring company in the news
* Their flagship Lexus (LS) is little difference in price from a Tesla Model S, but you're not going to find many buyers.  The Tesla Model 3 has more features than a Camry and is considered ""cool""
* Killing desirable models such as the Supra, leaving the title to the NSX

They are going to run into the same battery issue as TSLA, while TSLA has not only locked up a supply chain from Panasonic, but built out their Gigafactory in Sparks NV (which is running at full capacity if I do recall) manufacturing batteries.  TSLA is also building out factories in Texas, Germany and China.

I actually went looking at the Lexus LS (online shopping) last night and though it did carry a modest $79K premium, it came with features such as the traffic-aware-cruise-control.  The speed of the sedan wasn't great at 4.6s in 0-6 and years back it would cost more than $140K for the top of the line edition pushing me to the S-class MBZ.  Today, I am leaning towards the Plaid+ TSLA because of the features, and the driving experience (though quirks do abound)"

Fidelity is... Fidelity. Ol' reliable. Standard extended hours. No fees. Very wide OTC availability. Great customer service and plenty of peace of mind leaving my money there. You can even get a debit card and spend cash from your accounts."

03/17/2021,stocks,Thanks. I'm reading more into Argentina
03/17/2021,stocks,"There are several reasons why exponential growth is sustainable and what's most sensical. 

First, if you have a company, and you earn more than you cost (if you don't, you'll go bankrupt), the company will add more value to it every year. This money will be invested (either directly by the company, or indirectly by say dividends that are used to invest in other companies one way or another) into the market. This money will not only increase the market cap, but also be put into work and generate even more money. This is a typical feedback loop that generates exponential growth. What's interesting here is that not all companies need to succeed; it's enough that the net generated worth is positive.

Second, the stock market is essentially a pyramid scheme (chill, I am not saying they are the same, but that they share important characteristics for providing more value to those who invested earlier---this point is rather complex from a game theoretic view, but the basic idea is that it nudges the market in favor of earlier investors, no matter how the market goes), where everybody (except some hedge funds and those who buy shorts) have an incentive to increase its value. So there's a built-in incentive to sell higher (and of course buy low, but that's not the point, since people are psychological beings that have a harder time to accept losses than reap gains). This is the breeding ground for an expontential increase in value of stock.

Third, ... there are many more reasons, e.g., game theoretic. But I will leave this here for now."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I’m really curious about that also. Where is all of the money coming from? It’s not just a question about the future, I don’t really understand how it worked in the past also. 

Since 1927 (the earliest year I found data for), the stock market has gone up by a factor of about 235. Some of that growth is due to inflation, but not all. A dollar then is worth 15 dollars today, not 235 dollars today."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You can ponder it as a volume of cash, which doesn't exist, or the  amount of cash injected by each person.  Yet.

In the US, the average household makes $25K for easy math.  Every year, the number of households increase by 10% and the inflationary pressure on the dollar causes wages to increase by 2%.  100M x $25 = $2,500 Y1.  Y2 makes it 110M x $25.5 or $2,550 and repeat.  

So where does the extra money come from?  If the Government were to ""print"" more money, it would also be required to spend that money to get it into circulation.  This would increase the monetary supply and of course put pressure on wages, along with expenses such as home prices.

Now many of those people get more jobs, increasing the amount of money that can flow into the economy, and spend that money going out or buying stocks.  Some of them may even create companies that get listed on the market.

Okay, that explains how household net worth can increase - the Government prints more money, spends more money to get that money into the economy.  More people mean an exponential growth of expenditure and future outflows of capital.  

The same thing happens to the market.  Excess capital is invested into the markets (after all, stock markets are there to raise money for companies going IPO), and this may include people creating leverage.  Also, you run into the case of CDOs where a product can be resold as a larger block of (e.g. ETF) and subsequently resold multiple times.  

But it starts with the Government printing more money allowing more money to flow ""into"" the market as more buyers purchase the same commodity at a higher price."
03/17/2021,stocks,How many companies were there back then. Also how many people invested back then compared to now?
03/17/2021,stocks,"I actually agree on those points, however im not seeing the connection between them and the notion that exponential growth is sustainable. 

The issue I'm proposing is more so an issue with reliably increasing cashflow into stocks. For instance if, in 30 years, Apple has a market cap of $34.6 trillion in 2051 and everyone was investing in it, it would be mandatory that every year, the average investment into it would also have to increase by 7%.

If everyone that can invest in apple did, but collectively had only 3% to give, which we all have personal investing limits, even businesses, then the exponential growth would be forced to level off, not because the demand is there, but because it has outpaced financial supply.

What im saying can alternatively thought of as 'end-game pyramid scheme', where 100% of the population knows about it and participates as much as they can, but because of the rules in the pyramid scheme, everyone is pressured to satisfy an ever increasing financial demand among themselves, and are let down if they can't keep it up."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You had me until the pyramid scheme paragraph.

>So there's a built-in incentive to sell higher.

There's also an incentive to buy a company lower than you think you can earn from it as well. Price discovery is a real thing."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Population growth also factors in, more goods and services existing with growing populations and also the rising standard of living worldwide."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Good point, apparently in 1924 there were 2 billion people, yet today there are over 7 billion, that alone makes understanding the trend easier (although something else can be said about the global population plateuing once every country becomes developed, leading less people to be born and invest/own homes.)"
03/17/2021,stocks,Thanks for asking the question. I have wondered the same thing. Reading your question made those two items pop in my head.

this is a numbers game."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You do not have to use margin. Deposit the amount of money you want to invest and then be sure not to use more money than you deposit when buying stocks and you will never need to use the margin. Additionally, if you do somehow overspend and dip into margin be sure to deposit money within a couple days to clear out the margin owed before you have to pay interest."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Cash or Margin accounts are both fine. If you don’t get charged for unused margin, then it really isn’t a factor. You can choose to not use margin."
03/17/2021,stocks,All margin is that the brokerage house will front you money. You don’t have to use margin if you don’t want to. For example if you sell a stock and want to buy another stock that same day but need to use the cash from the sale to do It the brokerage house will front you the money until the sale of the stock is settled which is normally a couple days. Without margin you would need to wait for the transaction to settle before using that money. I would definitely use a margin account if they offer you one.
03/17/2021,stocks,Thanks for your response that makes sense. So basically they loan you money until the sale of the stock is settled? Does that have interest or cost anything extra?
03/17/2021,stocks,Yes that’s right and they do charge interest. You can also buy stock using margin for longer periods of time or take the cash out of the account. So it’s really like a loan from a bank. You should be aware of the rates if you use it for more than the first example I gave. Also be aware of margin calls and maintenance requirements you can easily look them up online.

\- "" There is always a chance of them doing more offerings, although I don’t see that happening personally. "" - No, CEO made clear that they did not plan it in the near future

\-  **Acquisitions:** One of the european ones will be a producer of machines, prop. central or eastern europe, to help them reducing their time to market for Dragonfly NG

\-  ""Able to be used in space. Whole lot cheaper to have some electronic component manufactured right there instead of having to send something into space "" No, at least not now and this is not he plan.

03/17/2021,stocks,Thanks so much to everyone responding so far! You’ve all been helping out tons!
03/17/2021,stocks,Vanguard for passive investing and fidelity for active investing. However I would suggest TD over fidelity for active trading

03/17/2021,stocks,Lmaooooo if this ain’t the truth
03/17/2021,stocks,this is the way
03/17/2021,stocks,Why would you say Schwab?
03/17/2021,stocks,"The transfer fee is leveraged FROM RH, _not_ Fidelity."
03/17/2021,stocks,I’m really sorry but I don’t understand the first top part? :/
03/17/2021,stocks,"Easy, free, reliable.

Also, they bought TD Ameritrade so I'd prefer not have to worry about the upcoming conversion of the account.

The other options have merit but I have 7 different Schwab accounts and don't pay anything.  Except the one time I was charged a foreign transaction fee of $50.  They removed it but now I just avoid stocks that have a 5 character ticker and end in 'F'"
03/17/2021,stocks,Ok. Like I said. Unsure because I'm still learning and new to this. I thought based on other posts that fidelity would reimburse the fee under x parameters. Or am I wrong about this?
03/17/2021,stocks,In that case go to Fidelity.
03/17/2021,stocks,Think or Swim is a trading platform run by TD Ameritrade. If you're moving from Robinhood... it's probably not for you.
03/17/2021,stocks,"TD = TD Ameritrade. Thinkorswim is their trading platform / app, which is super robust, and far superior to the clunky interface that Fidelity uses (never used Vanguard, but I believe it's more geared to buying and holding rather than active trading).

TD / Thinkorswim is best for active traders, and those who like to obsessively watch every single tick. Fidelity is nice if you like to trade OTC stocks, because in most cases they don't charge any extra commissions on those like some of the others do (TD charges $6.95, for instance). I have an account with them just for my OTC stocks.

Anyway, I'm partial to TD  obviously, but Fidelity has a good reputation too, and for whatever reason, most Robinhood refugees seem to be moving over there. Maybe someone else here can give their perspective on why?"
03/17/2021,stocks,Right on thank you so much!
03/17/2021,stocks,"They didn’t reimburse in my case but honestly it’s cost of choosing a bad place to trade. (Lesson learned on my part.) I also had to call as RH transferred my _cash_ shares (variety of portions, not just meme stuff) as margin even though my Fidelity account wasn’t margin enabled. Fidelity flipped that switch for me with no problem in less than 5 minutes and no questions.

I just wanted to make it clear for folks that RH is the one charging you the $75, not the new broker. Not an attack on you by any means."
03/17/2021,stocks,"OR you could move from RH and spend a few hours or days learning the app.

I was confused as hell but played with it, googled terms, played with paper trading etc until I got used to it.

Sure, it's not user friendly, it's a trading platform, it's supposed to give you a shit load of info with as little clicks as possible. RH hides everything from you."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Eh, it’s the only app I’ve found where you can make a similar interface to RH’s which I absolutely love. 


I would say if one is a new trader to stay away, but for people who are intermediate who have been using RH it’s a great substitute."
03/17/2021,stocks,No worries. My coworker talked me into setting up an rh account like 4-5 months ago. Just thought to expand somewhere that looks more reputable long term. But I'll bite the bullet if necessary. I just want a better place to put money long(er) term than my bank.
03/17/2021,stocks,Sounds like I should dump the $1400 into Webull then.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I dont quite understand your question but in this scenario all you did was save $3. Hypothetically if you sold it again at 217 and then bought it back at $150 that would still have nothing to do with the wash sale rule. 

The wash sale only affects your ability to claim losses on your taxes, it doesn’t affect what you actually make. In this case, you had a loss of $75. Due to the wash sale rule that loss can’t be included in your taxes because you immediately bought the stock back and are still holding it."
03/17/2021,stocks,"no practical effect.

for that one $295 share, you had a $75 loss.

when you bought it back at $217, your new cost basis is $217+$75 = $292, for tax purposes.

if one day the stock climbs back to $295 and you sell, that $217 share earns you  $295-$292= $3 in capital gains. You don't lose any money.

if it climbs to $250 and you sell, you would have a 250-292 = ($42) capital loss when reporting taxes"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Oh! Am I understanding this correctly: Let's say from all of my trades I have a net gain of $50 at the end of the year, the $75 wash sale won't come into play because I've made a profit (and not claiming an overall loss)?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"If your net gain in real life is $50 then on your taxes you will have to put profits of $125, because the $75 loss is not allowed to be included in your taxes since you immediately bought the stock back. 


Basically, the IRS doesn’t consider it a real loss until you go 31 days without touching that stock again.  

($50+$75=$125)"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Sorry for all of the questions, hope I'm not bothering you! I appreciate the help. 

Just watched a video from Fidelity, and it said that the cost basis is automatically adjusted when wash sales occur. Is that a good way to see if the wash sale is currently hurting me or not? Like if the adjusted cost basis is less than the current price of the stock, am I good? Or do I have to wait until I calculate net gains/losses at the end of the year, then factor in the $75?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Your broker does all the calculations for you and includes the correct amounts for you on a 1099 form that they prepare for you at year end. You don’t legally have to do any math.  

Of course you probably should anyway as double checking never hurts, but you aren’t required to. 

As far as what number is displayed when you log in and look at your stocks, that’s a different story. All brokers do that differently. Some brokers just stick to the real life cost basis, and some brokers factor in wash sales and subtract them from your displayed cost. I can’t speak to what fidelity does as I’ve never used them. However, you can be sure that next February, your 1099 will mark your wash sales and exclude them from your totals."
03/17/2021,stocks,Got it. Thanks a lot for your help!
03/17/2021,stocks,Looks like you'd be paying the 22% short term capital gains tax so yea looks about right. Not a c.p.a
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes, sounds about right."
03/17/2021,stocks,I'm in a similar boat. Do i need a tax guy now or can I port the data from robinhood and turbotax will tell me what's what?
03/17/2021,stocks,"You can’t claim the losses for this year on last year. However, you can claim a portion each year moving forward until the entire amount is deducted. 

There are still deductions you can take on your personal taxes that can help lower your taxes owed. 

As far as the amount you owe on your short term gains, that’s probably correct. They rape you on that. It is a sham what they do and is corrupt but that is the way of the world currently."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Go. Call. A. CPA. 

You're in way over your head or Reddit's collective brain on this one. You need to be calling someone for professional help right now, not looking for answers on a forum."
03/17/2021,stocks,I owed 2k on my state taxes and didn’t make any short term gains I’d say you’re pretty lucky there
03/17/2021,stocks,"Not a cpa.  This seems about right to me.  If you have 65k of realized gains on closed positions, then yes - you will owe a decent chunk in taxes."
03/17/2021,stocks,I don’t know. What percentage of your winnings is considered as taxable income and then what marginal tax bracket does that fall into
03/17/2021,stocks,Yes they will import
03/17/2021,stocks,Nah. Ain’t that hard with Turbo tax. Getting a CPA will cost $1000 minimum
03/17/2021,stocks,Nice. Thanks!
03/17/2021,stocks,"He's already done it with TurboTax - what he's asking for (any way to alleviate the resulting $18k tax burden) is something he should be asking a professional, not Reddit."
03/17/2021,stocks,There isn’t a way. He made gains.
03/17/2021,stocks,Yes. You have to pay a fee when you do though. I believe its 50 dollars every time you do it. So do it in big chunks.
03/17/2021,stocks,Why not open a Fidelity account? Or just purchase the equivalent Charles Schwab funds? It's a difference of 5 basis points. That's inconsequential.
03/17/2021,stocks,They’re not free if you don’t have fidelity. Probably better to just buy VTI or open a Fidelity.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Why are they zero fees?  Anything I need to be aware of?  I have fidelity but have been thinking of buying VTI on fidelity because 0% just sounds wrong. 

Any feedback?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yep, I’m sure Charles Schwab has similar funds. Unless you really really want those fidelity funds, you’re gonna have to pay a fee. But if so, just open a fidelity account? It’s free so you’ll save yourself a few bucks"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Depends on the ticker what the margin value is,
Some can be 100% even."
03/17/2021,stocks,"But in this case I have paid 66.66% of the price and I have borrowed 33.33% of the price from the broker, by logic my initial required margin should be equal to the amount that I have paid, so $2,000, am I right?

I am just asking for this particular case, where a purchase of $3,000 is made as first purchase in a margin account with $2,000 of cash. I can't borrow $1,500 (50% of LMV) because my Equity would be lower than $2,000 and this is forbidden in a margin account."

03/17/2021,stocks,Apple Tesla pretty easy picks
03/17/2021,stocks,are there any value etfs? that's what I've been looking for is a good one of those to start a position in.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Industrial ETFs (i.e. VIS but pick your flavor). Everyone’s supply chain is maxed out and they are all trying to get product moving as quickly as possible. Demand is there with cash flowing, it’s just a matter of time before sales hit."
03/17/2021,stocks,all the low PE stocks are fucking overpriced right now
03/17/2021,stocks,"Well the rates should actually be risen in one year imo. By not doing that until end of 2023, they gave the market a two year and a half year period of nearly zero rates. Rates are like gravity for asset prices: when reates stay low, asset prices rise, especially if this situation lasts 1-2 years at least."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I had a small position in BA, quadrupled it but then averaged up to $253 lol. Still looking like it has a lot of room and could easily surpass its $400 mark in the next year.

I looked up Intel, I like what I see but do you think it would be worth waiting for a sub $60 dip in the next month?"
03/17/2021,stocks,WOOSH
03/17/2021,stocks,"The biggest one is VTV, vanguard value which is total market but heavily weighted in big value stocks like Johnson&Johnson, there are also small and midcap value etfs."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm not really sure but that's not necessarily how value works. It would be better to look for undervalued businesses with lots of potential individually and invest in them slowly over time. An etf like that would kinda just be someone's opinion. 

If you want a ""etf"" based on value investing then Berkshire is basically that tho"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I understand that low interest rates are generally good for stock prices, but where does the 20% come from? Are you guessing the market will go up 20% this year?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I never try to time anything and I’m not sure what’d cause a 10%+ dip for Intel when it’s been underperforming the rest of the industry and is now playing catch up 

ITM leaps r fairly priced and I’m playing around the fact that the US will aggressively try to solve the chip shortage problem. My bets on Intel.

I personally don’t like penny pinching and trying to time the perfect entry. I just start my positions at anytime and gradually DCA to add to it"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Well, the last time the fed lowered the rates under tramp back than, the markets have risen about 40% without having great earnings growth. I just assume, the market would react with 40% over the next 2 years like back then. So not really sophisticated, rather a educated guess"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Ah, gotcha! Yeah, I don't know about what the market will do. I focus on a few stocks that I feel like are massively undervalued/mispriced by the market. So I don't really care about what the market does and just stick to my high conviction plays.   


In terms of value vs growth or low pe vs high pe, I obviously can't tell you what is better in the coming years. Most of the stocks I track are young high growth companies and therefor high pe stocks. This comes from the fact that I believe the market does a particular bad job at predicting future growth rates and margins for young companies. Then again the market does that fairly well for mature companies that have stable cashflows and such (most of the time value stocks).  


Anyway, in my personal opinion I am not surprised about the low interest rates and I expect them to be low for at least a decade. I believe we just entered a new era and investors simply have to take on more risk to get their returns.   


One last thing I want you to think about is: pe ratios historically always topped out at 20-25 and that was at a time of interest rates and economic growth of 4-5%. At the moment we are sitting at the upper end again (about 25) and of course everyone thinks stock prices are high, but think about the following. We basically have 0% interest rates globally and economic growth might be good in 2021 (because of the bounce back from covid), but could be slowing in the future. If these conditions persist what prevents us from seeing market wide pe ratios of 30-50?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Depends on inflation: with a 2% inflation, a risk averse investor would pay up to a p/e ratio of 50 because then he would at least get 2% return from the stock. But then, holding stocks would not be reasonable and people would sell it off"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I would absolutely put more than just 16% into VOO, as it’s an S&P 500 ETF and kind of a good picture of the overall market. You’d probably want this to be a good big chunk of your portfolio. As with the Ark ETFS and ICLN, they have more potential to return profit greater than the average S&P 500 etf return, however, that comes with much much more risk. Higher risk higher reward. Your portfolio as it stands is overwhelming growth, just be cautious. These are volatile times too"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I am a simple Investor, I see ARK, I upvote."
03/17/2021,stocks,"how about you incorporate a hedged in your plan. 

please trade responsibly."
03/17/2021,stocks,"If you’re in the UK you will not find all of these ETFs. ARK don’t exist in European markets but VOO, ICLN and QQQJ all have equivalents. 

Of course, ignore my comment if you’re setting up accounts in the US to trade rather than with UK/European brokers."
03/17/2021,stocks,I would take a look at each of the ETF's holdings to make sure there isn't much if any overlap.
03/17/2021,stocks,VOO vti DGRO vym are my go to
03/17/2021,stocks,"I fully expect ICLN to keep bleeding money for a while. The growth of their value since the start of corona has been \*massive\*, but there's not really a reason for it at all. At least with ARKK funds, you can make the argument that a lot of those companies are growing at a super fast rate (I think a lot of them are overvalued, but whatever), but are people / energy companies really ordering solar arrays and wind farms 10x faster than January of last year? Double? Maybe. Triple? On the outside, but I could be convinced. 10x? Get out"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Thanks dude, that makes sense. I'll go up to 30-40% for VOO"
03/17/2021,stocks,I would say triple is not a farcry
03/17/2021,stocks,"Same. Got in at 14$ and sold low 20’s :0 I’m keeping my distance for a while, gonna maybe go back to it once it looks more... reasonable"

03/17/2021,stocks,I wonder who will it actually be. At one point it was Hyundai and now it’s BMW. I just hope it’s coming and with a good manufacturer that let’s Apple do whatever they like to do with it.
03/17/2021,stocks,I’d rather see apple and Volkswagen join forces because vw has already come out saying electric is the way of the future for car companies especially with tech companies taking over market share

I think it's going to be a company who hasn't been rumored. Ford? Gm?"

03/17/2021,stocks,"7- SQQQ. If you’re gambling on a crash, go big or go home. Once you get 30% gain, pull it out and wait for the upswing to hit TQQQ."
03/17/2021,stocks,"That entirely depends on the reasons for the crash so you would then need to compare your scenario against previous examples and extrapolate what you can. Account for variations in communication and necessities, as well sociological and environmental psychological impact. 

E.g. Crashing due to a natural disaster that has short term but devastating impacts (hurricane or flood) will be quite different from a long term natural disaster such as an extreme drought or blight. Another consideration is a terrorist attack (homegrown or foreign) or a form of energy problem (Oil crisis or grid failures) or bubbles popping like the Dot Com or housing crisis..

03/17/2021,stocks,Every crash is unique and has its intrinsic. Studying the pass can only be useful to a certain extent. You need to focus on the underlying causes of the crash to have a better understanding of where to put your money.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but all of those ""Other Bets"" only make up 0,5% of Revenues at the moment. It's hard to tell if they will ever make a significant difference.

03/17/2021,stocks,Why not? Who's to say QQQ won't continue rising parabolically?
03/17/2021,stocks,It’s a lit stick of dynamite- hold on too long and it absolutely will explode. Would not recommend anyone actually do it unless it’s money you truly don’t mind losing. Definitely don’t cash out your entire fund and stick it in there. But if 100k is like 5% of your account? That’s a risk I’d personally take.
03/17/2021,stocks,Swing trading is where it's at
03/17/2021,stocks,"because all of nasdaq is overvalued. 

If you think about the S curve, initial run up is slow, then parabolic, then slow again.

03/17/2021,stocks,"That's a theory. I think the rise in multiples across the market even at, say, SIX, have started to make big tech multiples look by comparison and that increasing market breadth will be impetus for next leg up for QQQ

And if QQQ is somehow reflecting strength of tech (though it's composed of companies like Mendelez snacks even IIRC), then it can continue going up rapidly. Technological growth continues apace exponentially still. 

Also, I actually don't think Nasdaq is overvalued. Certainly not all of it. Yes, by conventional Schiller PE ratio, but not if you believe what Schiller himself said recently about valuations in indefinitely low rate environment.

Point is: if it's the Roaring 20s, we've barely begun. I keep an open mind"

03/17/2021,stocks,He refused to comment on the bank leverage ratio and said that had an announcement coming in days to come (so I'm hoping next week considering the policy expires the 31st)
03/17/2021,stocks,He got nervous when asked if we would be able to avoid the deflationary pitfalls that Japan fell into. Other than that - it was pretty well cleaned up and just rhetoric nothing of substance.
03/17/2021,stocks,"A really good statement, this seems more in tone with reality. Im confident we are going into a strong recovery and inflation will be manageable."
03/17/2021,stocks," ""The FED certainly gained more of my trust. I hope they can actually do these things and that today’s news aren’t just words and numbers.

Based on today’s reports, the economy is on good track. Inflation will stay moderate and interest rate will stay around zero for some time still.""

I would recommend you go look at the past history of the Federal Reserve's ability to predict the future. Look at how closely their projections match reality. In short, It's terrible."
03/17/2021,stocks,He says the Money printer is well oiled with fresh ink cartridges & He does not give a fuck about inflation. The party must go on! 🥳

03/17/2021,stocks,Inflation moderate? Thats not what i see at the grocery store
03/17/2021,stocks,seemed kinda evasive and actually admitted equity prices look high.

03/17/2021,stocks,He corrected these markets. That's a good thing
03/17/2021,stocks,I have confidence in Powell but he dodged a lot of questions when asked about the current admins future economic policies which worries me a bit but the Fed and Sec Mnucin did a hell of job the last year and overall things look good going forward.
03/17/2021,stocks,I didn't listen to him and I normally don't listen to any of his or any of the feds speeches for the last 15 years  and  my stocks still went up today like they normally do. Next time I'll listen to him and see if that changes things a bit
03/17/2021,stocks,Sounds like I’ll still be able to get a low rate on my next mortgage in July. I’m happy about that.
03/17/2021,stocks,Pretty sure he’s a robot.
03/17/2021,stocks,Idk him saying we were likely to see inflation rise to 2.4% by the end of the year was a bit concerning especially when we are still recovering and have 11% unemployment (participating and not participating).
03/17/2021,stocks,Havent heard of him in years.  He's got to be well into his 80s by now?
03/17/2021,stocks,I went full send as well. Took a nasty hit on Tuesday because of it. Mad some of it back today. But was definitely sweating a bit.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Not stupid at all, this week has been the most predictable week in a very long time. It was clear the people were throwing around FUD about interest rates that was truly just, ""what is Powell does something different than what he's been saying they'll do the entire past year, including just two or three weeks ago?""

It was obvious there would be a freakout ""just in case"" this morning, followed by Pow saying what he said and the bull rrush being back on."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Anyone else find it funny he has ran out of reasons to keep rates low, and cannot admit the zombie economy he's been propping up will explode if he quits buying bonds. So now he has to pretend to care about women and black employment numbers."

2. Higher prices at the grocery store doesn't mean inflation..."
03/17/2021,stocks,You do realize that 1) there's this weird thing that happened last year that threw supply chains a giant curve ball and 2) there's more grocery stores than the one you go too.
03/17/2021,stocks,Or gas stations

03/17/2021,stocks,Nah bruh
03/17/2021,stocks,lol
03/17/2021,stocks,That's hyperinflation. There's basically no scenario where a country with modern central banking that prints its own currency would experience Venezuela-esque hyperinflation.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don't know if it's a death sentence for the country, but yeah, don't hold cash or low yield stocks. Commodities, real estate or stock in companies that are going to stay active. I just can't see anyway a country the size of the US can hit Venezuela or Zimbabwe level inflation, 2000% in one year requires a massive amount of money printing and corruption, something just not achievable here."
03/17/2021,stocks,"so from what you wrote, I am inferring, 'ideas cost money' 

a hedge in 'smart metals' and currency (euro) along with shorting the us bonds and emerging markets, will cost you less and expose you more than, pouring it into stocks.

03/17/2021,stocks,"True, this sub justified their stocks rising 100% in 6 months in a global pandemic on falling yields and now are claiming rising yields will have no effect on them.

03/17/2021,stocks,In the UK at least people stuck at home spent money they would have used on holidays on DIY so all supplies for that went up in price or were just unavailable. I would imagine that has also come into play in the US.

03/17/2021,stocks,Bought at $4 weeks ago on the eve of WSB Cohen tweet decipher rumors. Sold the following day at $8 for a quick double up. I’d tread lightly here. I haven’t seen a catalyst worth mentioning besides that.  I don’t video game tho. I also don’t give financial advice.
03/17/2021,stocks,They're really promising and I honestly think they're going somewhere as gaming is becoming more digitalised. Partnering with mobcrush is only a small step and I see them expanding alot in the future.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Agreed, not much new news right now but lots of potential from their ability to scale and the continued/new partnerships they talked about in their earnings report. The management team seems capable to me, but definitely tread carefully as the other guy said. May dip short term (scale of a few weeks-months) but I believe one year from now it'll have been worth the hold."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yep, I was looking at then the next day I saw it referenced WSB as a good move for GameStop going into e-commerce to buy them out. Next day it was heading up. I have been waiting for them to stop pumping it so I can get in between 3-4 where it was."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Almost all of their money is from ad revenue through partnerships with companies like Netflix, Disney(?), Top Golf, Cinemark, and some others with some revenue also from minecraft server hosting subscriptions if I'm remembering their earnings report correctly.

03/17/2021,stocks,"That is very helpful! I just looked up the dividend, and it seems to be $0.70 per share on Apr. 20. I don't know enough about dividends to know how this will affect my exit strategy, or why the price went down after the announced dividend."
03/17/2021,stocks,I'm curious to know how did you manage to find it at $4?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Just bought some this morning because I liked the trending on their charts.

It's gone steadily from $4 to almost $18 in about 5 months."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I had 200 shares at around $4, and when it ran up to $9 really quickly I set a stop-loss on half for $7.50 to protect some of my profits. So of course it did what everything always does when I set a stop-loss: dipped just enough to touch it then went on its current big run. Happy to let my 100 shares ride, but wishing it was still 200."
03/17/2021,stocks,What a beautiful chart.
03/17/2021,stocks,Very nice numbers
03/17/2021,stocks,Same. Was actually the last time I learned that lesson. I had 3200 shares at around the same price. I was switching off Robinhood and I set a stop/loss because I wasn't monitoring it as much. We probably got boned by the exact same dip.
03/17/2021,stocks,I like how you compare the stock price and not the market cap. Vw is at 200b while tsla is at 670b. They are very different companies and fundamentals.
03/17/2021,stocks,"This is not investment advice, but the press has been very favorable after vw's presentation yesterday. Their German stock took off, too. They are the biggest company in Germany, again. A lot of people a lot smarter than me think they can give Tesla a run for their money in the global EV market. And, if I'm not mistaken, they already do outsell Tesla in the EU. Yeah, a lot of it's hype, but a lot of it is a major, legacy automaker taking EV tech and climate change seriously."
03/17/2021,stocks,I have a friend who's been hyping up Quantum scape and Volkswagen partnering up for a while. Is this jump in stock price related to the partnership?
03/17/2021,stocks,I’m a believer that vwagy will be a runner up to Tesla. Like Toyota to Honda. They have a new ceo who is rethinking the company. Plus when the VW EV bus comes out it will be a hit. I’m loving the rise.
03/17/2021,stocks,"One other note that can help your decision, [VOW.DE](https://VOW.DE) is the common german stock. 10 shares of VWAGY are equal to one [VOW.DE](https://VOW.DE). [VOW.DE](https://VOW.DE) closed at 303. VLKAF, another VW ticker (there are six of them) is trading at 430.

Here's an explanation of all the VW tickers. [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3chy9/what\_is\_the\_difference\_between\_volkswagen\_tickers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3chy9/what_is_the_difference_between_volkswagen_tickers/)

Disclosure: I bought 50 shares of VWAGY at an avg cost of 26.74 thinking that VW's EV push would pay off a year or two down the road."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I think VWAPY is a much better ticker right now. It hasn’t run up quite as much and historically VWAPY is trading at 20% discount to VWAGY. And even at 20% it was considered as good value. 

The 20% “discount” is due to VWAPY not having voting rights which is a moot point for most investors.  

VWAGY is at $43 and VWAPY is at $28 right now. That’s 35% discount. Seems like arbitrage to me. 

Currently holding VWAPY."
03/17/2021,stocks,I dont think any fundamentals justify what's happening right now lol
03/17/2021,stocks,"Tesla is not valued at $700 per share because they sell EV.  The market is pricing in their future prospects in entering the gigantic markets of residential solar, HVAC, auto insurance, and fully autonomous driving tech.  Car manufacturing will always be low margin.  From this perspective, VW will never, ever, be valued like Tesla.  Best of luck to them though."
03/17/2021,stocks,I too waffles at $18.. and I continued to waffle. Why am I me?
03/17/2021,stocks,"The pop in VWAGY (which is an ADR) today is driven by a short squeeze on its related German equivalent VOW, which has a free float of less than 8% vs short interest of 10%. 

The preference shares VOW3 (and its related ADR VWAPY) which are far more liquid (90% free float) are up as well due to EV hype but not that much. So it's a mix of technical and fundamental reasons. If U.S retail keep buying VWAGY then the squeeze will continue...
VW is a weird stock as the ""main"" share is the preference share, while the illiquid one is the common share."
03/17/2021,stocks,Don’t blaspheme the cybertruck like that
03/17/2021,stocks,"Did you just try comparing 2 ticker prices lol.

People please use DD


Tesla’s  worth more because EV and tech is the future, not only are they an auto manufacturer but they’re stemming into other tech sectors with their energy storage, solar panels and other EV and tech ventures.

Tesla is a status symbol, just like with Apple, they may not necessarily be the best on the market during times, but if it becomes cool to drive one and everyone wants one they’ll sell regardless.


And last time I checked no one flexes VW, but I’ll see a tesla in damn near every rap video/youtube video. Free publicity sells!"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Google search Diesel Gate. 
VW will always be crap."
03/17/2021,stocks,The catalyst was the CEO of another established company EV business giving themselves the title of Technoking..
03/17/2021,stocks,Im hoping this dips into the 30s or 20s ...i wanna buy in but thats the fomo boy in me
03/17/2021,stocks,I’m still scarred from the VW “we are here” posts  during the big pump and not dump GME money heist.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Of course they do outsell Tesla in europe and also in america, its a far bigger company than Tesla and far less overvalued."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Their new EV line is selling exceptionally well (a lot better than Tesla in most (all?) european countries) and they're slated to release a few additional Models this year.

Idk if i would read anything beyond this into this surge."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I really don’t hope that my original post gave off the impression that I think VW is a true Tesla competitor. But they can be huge in the EV market. I love the rise as well, but this might be worth 4 or 5x what it is now when EVs gain even more traction."
03/17/2021,stocks,Neither of them have voting rights since they're both unsponsored ADRs. Otherwise 1 is 1/10th preferred and the other is 1/10th common.
03/17/2021,stocks,What’s the difference between VWAPY and VWAGY? Why does VW have two symbols?
03/17/2021,stocks,Why do they have two tickets?
03/17/2021,stocks,This is the second wave of the short squeeze we’ve been waiting 13 years for!
03/17/2021,stocks,So the same as TESLA then.
03/17/2021,stocks,VW will have >50% market share in the EV sector in 5 years easily.
03/17/2021,stocks,"They invested a lot of money into battery tech via northvolt(sp?) in the last few days. They had a 'power day' event much like Tesla's battery day and said they plan on fighting Tesla in the battery market, not just buying batteries from third parties like they do now. All in all they plan on cutting costs of battery production by 50%. 

All good news for VW."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yea his analysis is ridiculous but so is yours, if tesla is the future so is vw, the issue with comparing two prices is that price doesn't matter its market cap that does."
03/17/2021,stocks,"No one flexes VW sure but do you have any idea which brands VW owns? 

Lambo, Bugatti, Porsche, Audi, Bentley...... so yeah the world's most expensive cars."
03/17/2021,stocks,i think so.....Tesla and VW are no where near the same thing
03/17/2021,stocks,"The irony is that VW's push into EVs is a direct result of them being caught in diesel gate. I didn't forget. I'm willing to forgive, however."
03/17/2021,stocks,"They’ll downvote facts in this thread, it’s okay homie Ill give you an upvote."
03/17/2021,stocks,I should have been more clear. I believe their EV sales are already greater than Tesla's in the EU.
03/17/2021,stocks,"And in America - would love to see that statistic? 

Cause I think you’re chatting crap.

“To be precise, 79% of all EVs registered in the US last year were Teslas. Yes, that many.”

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/tesla-cars-ev-registrations-us/"
03/17/2021,stocks,"ID.4 is the big one this year. New electric model every year until 2025 is on the roadmap. 

They have the biggest car factories in the world, so can reach economies of scale faster, and then start offering cheaper cars."
03/17/2021,stocks,"At this point, almost every company is a Tesla competitor. It's just a matter of how long it takes for them to get good EVs with FSD into the market."
03/17/2021,stocks,Yes you are right. Sorry. Will make a change to my other post as well.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Because it is stupid. Seriously. I spent days researching it. And they don’t have 2, they have 4.  

So there are two main tickers: VLKAF (ordinary) and VLKPF (preferred). Their current prices are $421 and $279.  The only difference is that VLKAF has voting rights. Unless you own a significant % of the company that doesn’t matter. 

Now VWAGY and VWAPY are ADR shares that trade at 1/10 of the main two I discussed above. Neither of these have voting rights. And yet VWAGY is currently at $42.1 and VWAPY is at $27.9. That’s a huge discount!

Additionally, the cheaper preferred stock is being traded on the German exchange and is more liquid. 

I think this anomaly in pricing is because US investors are not familiar with all these different tickers and buy VWAGY. It is almost like a pump these few days mainly driven by US investors. 

I think either VWAGY will come down to the level of VWAPY or VWAPY will catch up with VWAGY. 

Regardless this huge discrepancy makes no sense.

03/17/2021,stocks,"But it will probably continue to make billions selling cars.

Heck, their new EV line is out for what, like 5 months, and they're already selling more electric cars than Tesla.

And they're releasing another 2 or 3 new models this year."
03/17/2021,stocks,tesla isn't powering cities you stupid fool
03/17/2021,stocks,"OK in the above comment you said no one likes vw cars now your bullish? But whatever, like I said diversification dosnt equal more value, teslas other ventures are not doing well, the story of tesla powering cities sells, the reality is that they are losing so much money in other ventures and are taking their eye of the ball, cars. Yahoo made this mistake as well, they tried ro get as much diversification as possible and took their eye of the ball search, and look what happend."
03/17/2021,stocks,"That's so not true, like I said if you do multiple things but they are all losing money vs one thing that is more profitable, which one do you think wins, again diversification dosnt equal value which is especially true in tesla's case."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Never said VW wouldn’t. 

Just stating the fact that the models of their business are much different and thus valued differently"
03/17/2021,stocks,"are you not aware of the megapacks? or the green mountain power deals that saved vermont millions? 

or the UK and Germany energy grid supplement that utilizes autobidder? 

or the Austin Texas Battery to Grid in Angleton

or Southern California Edison's Mira Loma substation, located east of Los Angeles

the now second Megapack at Burgess Hill in the Mid Sussex District of West Sussex

the South Australia megapack

United Power Cooperative 30 miles north of Denver that supplies the area.


i know im missing some as well"
03/17/2021,stocks,They already do... this sub has turned into a joke. They have mega packs in southern Australia and have had them there since the Australia blackouts in 2016 and 2017. They’re currently constructing more mega packs in Austin
03/17/2021,stocks,"You need to spend money to make money pal. 

Absolutely bullish seeing a company invest billions into ventures that can change the world, and I’d be a fool to not secure some sort of shares in that company."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Nothing happens overnight, tesla is doing ro many things in such a early stage eventually it will all crumble, teslas cars need to up quality they need to if they want the luxury market, cars are an extremely capital intensive industry and they can't afford to do 20 things at once, this exact same mistake happend ro yahoo they didn't perfect search and tried ro be to many things and eventually it all fell down. Amazon perfected books before it went to toys and it perfected toys before it moved into aws, it took Amazon 20 years to get to where it is, tesla is trying to do it in a short time frame and it will not work like it has not worked in the past."
03/17/2021,stocks,What happens if it doesn’t burst and elon pulls of successful profits?  Ill be glad I locked in my shares at 550 presplit price
03/17/2021,stocks,"Sure you can take that risk if you want, but you treated it as if tesla is so much better than vw, and the story of tesla is the data and their business model has flaws, I won't tell you what to do but I'm done with tesla holders acting like tesla is foolproof."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Volkswagen makes some absolutely horrid ICE, but i hope they turn around when it comes to EV for yours and my sake."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Lol, vw is a conglomerate, audi is wonderful so is porche, and I'm sure you like lamborghini and bugatti, and tbh vws ice cars are not ""horrid"" and their evs are undeniably better built than tesla, bow you might not care about luxury or build quality but there are many who do, basically cars are subjective and to call a company who owns many respected brands horrid is a little ignorant."
03/17/2021,stocks,Have you worked on any of those cars lol? Tesla needs to make cars more “reliable” says the nay sayers. Pretty sure you didn’t mention a single reliable brand.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I never said reliable I said build quality, meaning quality of materials or how about roofs not flying off stuff like that, that's what German brands are for and to claim that those people who want a luxury experience instead of a techy one are picking horrendous cars is ridiculous."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Not sure about books, but the Plain Bagel on YouTube does a great job breaking down stuff like this:
https://youtu.be/hP027bv2jCg"
03/17/2021,stocks,Thank you!
03/17/2021,stocks,No problem!
03/17/2021,stocks,BXE had a 1 for 5 stock split on 7/6/17 then a 1 for 12 stock split on 6/7/19 then was acquired in an all-cash deal by Spartan Delta Corp for CAD 87.6 million on 6/1/20. Adjusted for splits the share price in 2014 was around 400 CAD vs a buyout around .2849 so your position would have netted $140 in cash - perhaps check your brokerage account to see if it was deposited and if not you could probably track it down. The transaction should allow for a realized loss tho on your 1099 for your 2020 tax return so got that going for you.
03/17/2021,stocks,"They were doing so bad that they did reverse splits to keep the value not penny, but it kept dropping so it still ended up as penny stock.

You got it before oil price crashed, which killed a lot of related stock."
03/17/2021,stocks,I'm gonna guess they did some reverse splits.
03/17/2021,stocks,Why guess? It's current market price is $0.38/share.
03/17/2021,stocks,Never heard before of Bellatrix but it’s likely they  have done a reverse stock split meaning they reduced the shares issued. If this happened then your shares should still be worth the same as your other 500 shares that you had in the past
03/17/2021,stocks,"Well your numbers account for the number of shares I currently own.  I had 600 shares, which turned into 120, which turned into the current 10.  That's how many I have now.  There was no buyout at least that I was made aware of.  So it looks like I'm stuck with 10 shares worth .38 each?  My cost basis for this stock is $2171.  I'm guessing I can't take the loss on my 2020 taxes since it looks like I still own the 10.  Do I need to dump them now so I can claim the loss for 2021?"
03/17/2021,stocks,That's an innocent view on reverse splits
03/17/2021,stocks,Sorry - looked further - the transaction is pending court approval in Canada. Probably will close in 2021 ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/23/2020789/0/en/Bellatrix-Announces-Sale-Transaction-in-Connection-with-its-Strategic-Process.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/23/2020789/0/en/Bellatrix-Announces-Sale-Transaction-in-Connection-with-its-Strategic-Process.html))
03/17/2021,stocks,"But its true, they are merged together to form more valuable shares"
03/17/2021,stocks,"ok thanks.  so if I wait till this goes thru, my 10 shares will automatically be sold and I'll get around $150 for them?"
03/17/2021,stocks,Reverse splits 99% are very bearish
03/17/2021,stocks,"The ONLY time a company would do *2* reverse splits is if their share price tanked.  
It's pretty obvious their share price plumetted, as well as OP's investment.  
Glad to have you contribute, but please ensure you provide accurate information, rather than give others false hope."
03/17/2021,stocks,unless those more 'valuable' shares crash...
03/17/2021,stocks,Yes sir.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Ahaha sorry, as I said above I don’t even know what bellatrix is, I don’t know any background history or what the share price of that company is. Next time I’ll provide more accurate information by researching the stock before providing advice. Thanks for the feedback"
03/17/2021,stocks,"well i guess that’s better than nothing.  i was expecting $3.80.  i don’t understand how you got the multiplier number to estimate value, but i sure appreciate the help."
03/17/2021,stocks,"NP; we're all here to learn! I often come here to learn, too.  
GE just announced some news including that they want to RS to raise their stock price, and as soon as they announced that, their share price fell by quite a bit. Many of their shareholders know that RS aren't good, and it is often times a last-ditch effort by companies. GE more than likely won't continue to fall much as a result of a RS, but many of their shareholders let them know what they thought about it."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I was just using your share count x the 0.2849 per share which was quoted online. The transaction included the assumption of debt so I was assuming no debt reduction from that number but I looked at the court order and they're actually in the Canadian equivalent of Chapter 7 so I doubt there will be any proceeds to distribute to equity holders - my pricing must be very delayed - sorry about that. I wouldn't expect the $150 and that actually changes things as it now qualifies to be deducted.

You should fill out a form 8949 with your 2020 tax return and just list your full cost basis for what you bought and put $0 for sale price. Nice time to take any offsetting long-term capital gains if you want to offset the loss at all.. But I'm no accountant and this is doesn't qualify as accounting nor financial advice."
03/17/2021,stocks,I like IG. Havent had experience with any other brokers but neat and easy to use. You need to be eligible to open an account though. Doesn’t take long at all to check.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Degiro
- low fees
- access to all markets
- very good app"
03/17/2021,stocks,I use igindex had some issues with trading212 before with bad servers during busy periods
03/17/2021,stocks,I use iweb-sharedealing (by lloyds). No bells no whistles not even an app(their web has mobile interface) but lowest fees. Withdrawals are a bit slow but not a problem for me.
03/17/2021,stocks,What do you want to trade?
03/17/2021,stocks,I use ajbell you invest. Fees aren’t free but has a good selection of stocks and is easy to use. Also use Freetrade for smaller punts but has much less stocks listed
03/17/2021,stocks,Thankyou all
03/17/2021,stocks,"TradeZero. It's a Bahamian broker with SCB and global regulation, so it's vetted to give international services, and it allows a lot of services that I didn't get on 212, namely stuff like quick execution, premarket and after hours trading, and options trading. The fees are high through, but those fees are mainly reserved for options trading, which isn't a big deal for me since options themselves are a 1:100 leverage. 

If you're not comfortable with a non-UK or European based broker with FCA regulation, I'd recommend IG or Interactive. I don't go with them because the stock selection is limited for what I like to trade, and they hardly offer any options trading - it's pretty much all CFDs, plus the interface isn't as sexy as TradeZero."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm keeping an eye out myself. Depends if by better you mean still free. 

Freetrade is really simplistic for buy and hold and it's enough for me, very basic though and a bit crippled without the paid features. 

Degiro sounds good, I would have gone for it. But no ISA, which is a deal breaker for me."
03/17/2021,stocks,Doesn't offer an ISA though.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Terrible website, terrible fx fees, terrible service."
03/17/2021,stocks,You trade stocks. For ISA check Moneysupermarket.
03/17/2021,stocks,Change your plan of 90% mutual funds to 100%. It sounds like you can’t handle the monthly price changes for single stocks
03/17/2021,stocks,"Do you think your positions are overvalued or undevalued after the correction ? It’s the only thing to look at
Also it seems that your portfolio was very sensitive to tech stocks, there is probably a diversification problem here.

Maybe sell the stocks that you think are still overvalued (try not to pay attention at how much they loss value) and buy some other stocks in other domains.

Also dont panic sell :)"
03/17/2021,stocks,"And if you haven't already, you should look into opening a (Roth) IRA. Dividends and gains are tax-free, and you can buy and sell virtually any stock. I actually opened one a few months ago and it only took 5 minutes. I funded it and the money was in my account the next day."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don’t see the sense in selling at a loss. Take it out if there is a legitimate better opportunity for the money, but don’t sell just to yolo it on something else. Also you might have just learned something about your risk tolerance. Unless you plan on batting 100% on these smaller riskier plays, it’s probably not a good idea to start if you want to sell down 20%"
03/17/2021,stocks,If you’re not trying to get rich quick then you shouldn’t worry about short term moves in stock price.
03/17/2021,stocks,"As long as the high risk stocks you are holding aren't complete shit penny stocks, but growth stocks, you should hold them for the long term and maybe lower their cost basis if you have done DD on them and have conviction that they will be big in the future. If they are shit penny stocks then consider selling and rotating the money somewhere safer since you aren't very experienced

The market being red is the best time to look for buying opportunities, so don't worry about your solid long term positions and focus on other stuff you can pick up."
03/17/2021,stocks,"My own view.
I've decided to study macro economy and monetary history. Since than I hate the monetary system we have, hate the fact we work for paper that they keep debasing it's discussing the illusions we live in.
I have physical silver and gold. Gold and silver allocations.
Silver, gold, uranium mining stocks and farmland.
I've got about 5-10% in crypto.
If I had more cash. I would have some allocated to emerging markets. Farmland properties. Properties and land in different countries (emerging countries). Second passport and a house to move in case things go wrong where you live."
03/17/2021,stocks,"He doesn't need to avoid stocks completely, but he should take a long term view of all his investments.  Forget about short term trading altogether."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I think it's less about handling the ups and downs. I'm using money I can afford to lose and understand stocks don't only go up.   


I was more looking for some advice or strategy from others who have been in similar situation. What are some plays for when you have bad timing and your positions are red.   


Some that come to mind:   
\- if you believe in the company, sit on them and wait for a bounce back  
\- sell some at smaller loss to open a position in something else you think will be more profitable  
\- sell some covered calls for premium to help offset  


\- something else?"
03/17/2021,stocks,This is solid advice. Thank you. I can do a better job at taking a closer look at my positions and the valuation of each.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Good tip - thank you.   
I currently only have a 401(k) through my employer and my own personal brokerage account with Fidelity."
03/17/2021,stocks,"yea - appreciate this reply.   
I agree, not selling at a loss to yolo on some meme stock. I'm not trying to get rich over night.   


I'm just feeling a bit stuck as all my positions are red. I don't want to sell at a loss and I don't have much cash to take advantage of the lower red days for good entries.   


Maybe a lesson learned is about how much cash to keep on hand?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"If you have capital gains, it's often times smart to sell some of your losses at the end of the year to reduce/eliminate your capital gains taxes. Put the money to work in an index fund where it will actually grow. In one sense, it's a type of double gain; instead of paying perhaps $1,000 in capital gains tax, you might pay $0. Then your new ETF is put into a position of being able to grow and make money, rather than trying to get it's head above water - which may or may not happen.
I still have a few shares of Ford from 20 years ago that are down ~20%. I keep them as a visual reminder, and a reminder of what dead money does to you."
03/17/2021,stocks,"thanks.   


What would you consider ""short term""?   
That is one of the things I'm trying to better understand. Are people either day-trading or holding stocks for several months / years? Is there not much in between?   


I'm sure it's personal preference and some people set limit sells at 10%, 15%, 20%, whatever the case may be... maybe it takes 3 days to get there, maybe it takes 3 months?   


It's all new to me - so happy to gain some perspective."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Thanks for this advice, I appreciate it.   
Part of my problem was maybe not leaving enough cash on hand for the red days, which is why I feel stuck.   


I don't have garbage penny stocks - most are one's I've read up on, some I have less conviction about then others."
03/17/2021,stocks,"That, and retirement is supposed to be for the long term, not short term.  
OP should also dump a ton more money into ETF's/Index funds when markets eventually tank 25-50%"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I actually opened mine thru Fidelity; my job used them, so I already had a profile set up. It was ridiculously easy, and I'm glad I did it."
03/17/2021,stocks,"The volatility of certain stocks in this market, like GME and AMC for example, along with other meme stocks, have given a lot of people the false impression that you can make 10%, 15%, 30% in 3 months or less. In reality, this is rare. If it wasn’t, everyone would be rich. You just can’t expect stocks to move like that. On the flip side, if something has suddenly jumped 30%, you’re likely too late to get in. Either it’s a short squeeze or a pump that will plummet back to earth, or all the good news is priced in already and there’s slow attrition from folks selling and making profits. Rarer than the stock that jumps 30% in a short time is the stock that jumps 30% and then 30% again. 

I’m a believer that you can beat the market, but you have to be very deliberate with your choices and have realistic targets in mind. There are some very smart people on Reddit but it’s really hard to find the ones who are doing good, solid DD and who are just bullshitting or trying to pump a half-baked idea."
03/17/2021,stocks,This is great - thanks for taking the time to further respond. Very helpful.
03/17/2021,stocks,laws.
03/17/2021,stocks,Even leaking such information to family and friends is illegal... Many still do it... some get caught... See Rajat Gupta ex CEO of Mckinsey for example
03/17/2021,stocks,Controllers of media can surely manipulate stocks through “journalism” as well
03/17/2021,stocks,Im sure this happens 99.9% of the time. usually via leaking info to friends and taking a cut of the big $. If you had access to insider info you would too.. I would 110%
03/17/2021,stocks,The honor system lolz
03/17/2021,stocks,"Nothing. They do this. They get away with it, too. We just only hear about the ones that get caught.

Some companies have blackout periods where they have upcoming news and advise employees not to trade for that period of time. If they do trade, the company rewards them with a ticket to the unemployment line."
03/17/2021,stocks,not much
03/17/2021,stocks,For sure a lot of insider info is leaked. It's one of the reasons I think long-term investing is the best option. The smart money already knows the news before it breaks
03/17/2021,stocks,Martha Stewart
03/17/2021,stocks,nothing happens to them

03/17/2021,stocks,Martha Stewart might be more relatable.
03/17/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/17/2021,stocks,I think it is due to FIFO. You probably bought your shares at different times. For tax purposes the shares your sold were the first ones you bought  First In First Out. Your remaining shares were priced higher so your basis went up. LIFO is Last in First Out.
03/17/2021,stocks,"My assumption would be a Wash sale. You would need to look at the realized gain/loss for the sold share and/or the transaction history of the purchase.

Edit: Cost basis isn’t an average, but instead separate purchases will have different cost basis."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Not a wash sale, as your are correct. It should only be for losses. What platform are you using?

Double check your bought/sold history to make sure you are putting in the correct orders. Most likely it’s just a glitch that will sort itself out by tomorrow."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Look at your total stock value not your per share basis. 

Say you bought the first stock ever at $100 and the other 33 at $221.06. That’s a $217.5 average and total investment of $7395.  At this time let’s assume the stock is at $221 and for easy math doesn’t move until you buy back your share. Your total stock value is - $7514. You are up $119

Now you sold one. So the $100 share is gone (first in first out) and you have 33 shares at $221.06 each (and $221 sale price in cash. This is a $121 profit on that first share.) your total value is $7293 plus $221 in cash = $7514

Now price drops and you spend the $217 on a share. 

So you have 33 at $221.06 and 1 at $217

Your total investment is $7511.98 average $220.94 - up from where it was, and your total stock value is $217x34 = $7378

Should the stock go back up to $221 you will have $7514 but you spent $7510 on it so this time you’re up $4


It’s much easier to compare the current single stock price to an average cost per share though than total up the complete value each time.

Your total investment is up by $100 because you bought in by a higher price than what you bought the first share at. But you made a profit on that first share.

TLDR - you made a profit on your first share that you cashed out. Then you put this back in at full cash value. So you technically have more money invested than you did before (you just turned that $100 of unrealized gains into realized gains and invested it). But because the average is around the market price, it’s not an overall profit.

This is very hard to visualize/calculate when you don’t take into account the moving stock price. You have to separate p it chase price from current value in order to see the profit."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Ok sorry I edited my other posts out a million times but I found your $100

You are not taking into account the changing price of the stock when you are looking at “I made $4 or lost $100”

You MADE $100 on the first stock you sold, but you put it back in the market at $117 higher than you had bought it at (and $4 less than you sold it for.) Thus almost completely washing out your profit on that single stock. And meaning you have $100 mode of yo he own cash (vs unrealized gains) in the stock.

You will not see your $4 profit in your cost basis, but rather in your total stock current value (assuming it stays at $221.)."
03/17/2021,stocks,This happened to me too. I’m also new and curious
03/17/2021,stocks,The weird thing is that for a different stock I did actually sell for a loss then buy back and it was labeled as a wash sale but this time around it doesn’t say that it is.
03/17/2021,stocks,I trade on Fidelity.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yup, that's exactly what happened. 

I just found out that you can sell specific shares so I sold my highest paid one ($295) for $221 to bring my cost basis back down to $217. Since the stock is so volatile, I was able to buy one back for cheaper ($217) than I sold it for, but that triggered a wash sale. I'm not sure if that was a bad or good thing - on one hand I brought my cost basis lower by a decent amount but on the other hand I don't know how/if the wash sale would negatively affect me (even if let's say I brought my average cost lower than what the stock is currently worth)."
03/17/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/17/2021,stocks,"And some platforms you can change it from first in first out to something different, but I know Fidelity does it that way at least by default"
03/17/2021,stocks,They were bought incrementally over a couple of weeks and a lot of the transactions were only 1-4 shares at a time. The range of the price per share also varied a lot. Some were purchased at below $150 and others above $250.
03/17/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/17/2021,stocks,"Okay, then that explains it! My initial shares were probably bought at least $150 less than what they currently are. I wasn’t aware that you could choose which shares to sell specifically."
03/17/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/17/2021,stocks,"Thanks, it worked! Let’s say “hypothetically” that I just sold one of the earlier shares I bought (at $295) for $220, then buy one share back at $210 to lower my cost basis. Do you think that the wash sale would be worth bringing down my average cost per share (back down to $217/share from the initial $220.5/share) if the stock is currently worth $220+? Or will the wash sale overshadow the profit?"
03/17/2021,stocks,Lots of large companies are getting a lot of debt because of how cheap it is right now.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Debt is still cheap.

The last decade has taught me... Never, ever, bet against the House of Mouse.

They're a true conglomerate. They'll be talk of antitrust loooong before anyone has the gall to mention their debt."
03/17/2021,stocks,I'm not at all concerned about disney
03/17/2021,stocks,Borrowing money is essentially free currently.  The House of Mouse will be fine.
03/17/2021,stocks,Simply because rates are so low that getting in debt is lot more advantageous that spending your cash
03/17/2021,stocks,"Disney is one of those companies that you don't have to worry about their cash flow and in my opinion even at its current price its undervalued. 

It not a matter of if Disney+ will pass netflix its a matter of WHEN."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I think we have a lot of younger adults here.

You might not understand it now, but when you have kids and grandchildren, you will understand. You WILL be a Disney+ subscriber, for your sake, not theirs.

And so far they are on pace to pass Netflix in subscribers by 2024. That sounded ambitious in the report, but I'll take the under."
03/17/2021,stocks,"No, I’m not concerned at all. They’ve been racking it up since debt has been very cheap lately. Different metrics like D/E, current ratio, etc. also show that Disney’s debt is pretty well under control even though their credit rating did get downgraded. It can only get better as parks open and they can pay the debt down more.

Disney will always be around. It’s just a huge company with a brilliant brand."
03/17/2021,stocks,Cheap! Debt doesn’t even hold against real inflation (free money)
03/17/2021,stocks,what value are you looking at?
03/17/2021,stocks,"If Disney's debt was a problem, we'd have heard something along the lines of credit default swaps pricing in x% chance of Disney default."

03/17/2021,stocks,The House of Mouse has some been a monopoly longer than boomers have been alive.
03/17/2021,stocks,What’s anti trust
03/17/2021,stocks,"Can this sentiment be seen with Ford too? They're expansions into EVs seem to be pretty fun to speculate and while they have a crapload of debt that really shouldn't turn off their prospects right? 

Also wtf VW"

If they have to buy on the open market, it may push the price up even more.  
I'd hold for a while, but when they do actually take over the other company, there is a decent chance your account will be subject to a $30 'restructuring fee' or something like that. So you may want to sell right before the deal is finalized to avoid any possible fees."

03/17/2021,stocks,I'd say you could have bought stocks and keep buying as it went down if you believe it's undervalued. But that's just my opinion.
03/17/2021,stocks,*following
03/17/2021,stocks,"I haven't looked at all into EV chargers.   I know nothing about them.   I have a question. 

The electrical grid has been built over a long period of time to supply the right amount of power to where it's needed.   It's very hard to build things in America.      I'm picturing a typical apartment complex supplied with power lines designed for all the apartments household loads.  Even adding just half of the parking spaces with charging stations would require higher voltage lines,  including different substations upstream, with more power plants connected. 

How are EV charging stations going to get the infrastructure needed to supply them?  What time frame do you expect this to happen."
03/17/2021,stocks,Short term depends on the USA infrastructure bill.  There's a good chance that EV charging network subsidies or tax breaks will be in it.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I’m still buying daily, but now I’m starting to second guess myself."
03/17/2021,stocks,Residential chargers are going to require major electrical upgrades.  Commercial installations are less of a problem.  They normally have higher capacity already and anyone setting up a large charging installation is going to verify that as part of the site plan.  I think that on-site energy storage will be necessary to reduce transient loading during commuting hours.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Ah ok, I thought you were using leverage, my bad."
03/17/2021,stocks,"All of the power lines have a voltage and Power rating (KW). They are sized for a small (10%) over predicted peak demand (hottest summer day in the south or coldest day in the north).  

If you predict large scale adoption of EVs (say 50%?) that load demand will be much higher with all the charging stations.   Before you can install enough charging stations the power lines would need to be replaced with larger capacity ones, and those need different poles to support them.  It's also inefficient to take residential voltage (220V) and then raise it to 600V for high capacity charges, much better to use 1.4KV and step that down (lower voltage means more amps for the same power and high amps means high heat).  That means different sub stations upstream. Overall,  an increase in electricity use (substituting electricity over gas) means more power plants. 

So commercial is much more challenging than residential since comercial areas have more impediments to putting in bigger lines, poles and substations and don't have a lot of spare distribution capacity (don't want to de-energize an area for a month to run the new lines).  

Just based on how long it takes to build things i wouldn't bet on even moderate scale adoption of EV and therefore charging stations for a minimum of a decade and realistically much longer."
03/17/2021,stocks,"The NEC will have to adjust to accommodate residential charging stations and utilities will have to up their residential voltage to 250/125VAC but that's probably the practical max due to the limits of existing appliances and safety concerns.

Residential stations can be of lower capacity since homeowners will tolerate longer (often overnight) charging.  Smart meters enable off-peak metering and scheduled charging times for load-balancing.

The difficulty of adding grid capacity will depend on the location.  Some will be easy, some not.  Utilities usually don't have to shut the grid down when installing new lines, only for switchover.  They do that all the time."
03/17/2021,stocks,Thats not how any of this works.  You can't just adjust residential voltage! Where do you think adding grid capability is easy? I'm asking a serious question!  They absolutely do NOT switch out lines all the time.  Get real.
2021-03-17 19:47:48,stocks,"Cost per share of stock going up overnight? Hey guys, 

I am fairly new to trading; I barely started back in August of 2020.  I have noticed that my last two trades have done something very weird and I couldn't find the answer on Google.  I have bought a stock for a price and then it changed.  

The first time happened last week.  I bought a stock at $260 during trading hours, and a couple hours later, still during trading hours, TD Ameritrade had my cost per share of the stock down to $218.  This time, I bought the stock during trading hours at $210, and I woke up this morning to see that my cost per share was $230. 

Why is that?"

Thank you for the responses.  I am not talking about the market price of the share.  I am talking about my actual order that had already gotten filled.  It would say that my order got filled and show that I have shares in my portfolio at X amount of dollars per share and then later that price changes.  

So even after my order has already been filled, the price that I paid per share can still change?"

03/17/2021,stocks,I use TD Ameritrade as my brokerage and I was previously aware that they average out the cost if you purchase more shares of the same stock.  I was confused because I had completely closed out my position and re-purchased at another time.  What made things even more confusing was that at first it reflects the cost that I put my order in for and then later changes.
03/17/2021,stocks,I think this might be the answer.
03/17/2021,stocks,Ahhhh...wash sale. Didn't think of that one.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Previous ownership (as in all of those shares were sold) should have zero bearing on current cost basis values. That's ridiculous and provides zero benefit that I can see. Once a share has been sold, it's gone. 

Old purchases are relevant to cost basis only while any of those shares are still held.

If I buy 100 shares, my cost basis for those shares never changes while I own the shares (unless you're using an accounting method that reduces the cost basis when writing covered calls or reinvesting dividends, but pretend that you aren't for simplicity). If I am still holding those shares when I buy another lot of 100 shares, then I would own 200 shares at an average cost basis derived from the two purchase prices. If I sold off the first 100 shares, then the average cost basis would be just the price paid for the 2nd lot--the shares bought at the 1st price no longer exist in the account.

Why would anyone want to average the price of closed positions into the cost basis?"

""However, the ideological framework one must have to follow these doomsday scenarios is both far to optimistic on humanity's ability to forecast, and far too pessimistic on humanity's ability to adapt and innovate. "" -   


This is basically you telling us not to trust the consensus of scientists across the world - and I don't think you really justified why we should do that, even if previous generations has been wrong about religion etc.  


 I also think that if we want to be optimistic on humans ability to adapt and innovate we should put our money in that direction and not against it. But i do agree that oil will be profitable for the foreseeable future, but I think there are equally big gains to be found in greener energies, and putting your money there might fuel that innovation that you talk about."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don't really know what I should say or what you are asking. Do you want to me draw similarities to the fact that the same fortellers of the past were also considered top of their field? Or should I get into the methodology for scientific consensus? Or how scientific consensus is, as a concept, antithetical to science? Or how simply believing something because someone else says it's true doesn't mean you're closer to the truth than saying you lack the understanding to make a judgment on it (which is the most similar to how I believe) 

The question of what should be done is far more tricky. It is the critical driver with my disagreement with most doomsday ideologies. I don't really like discussing it because you're only ever right in hindsight. Like how Germanys push to wind energy was a complete disaster by almost every metric but those who pushed for it aren't too keen on examining it now. Or how peak oil was taught in California curriculum but no one who believed it wants it admit it anymore.  These were predictably bad ideas, but were considered fact. 

I'm not telling anyone to not trust the zeitgeist of modern scientists. Literally not what I am saying at all. 

Yeah, green energy might be a great investment. Have at it. I don't like it for reasons more akin to the reason I don't like defense contractors. However this new trend of activist investor is insanity and fundamentally misunderstands how the markets work and how equities are priced. Buying a green company could be a great investment, but doing so to encourage green development is complete horse shit. That's not how the market works."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Saying ""scientific consensus"" is just a shortcut so we don't have to go over the thousands of reports by nasa, Berkeley, ipcc, etc in a reddit comment thread.  Litterally 97-98 percent of studies on the topic says that global warming is manmade and continuing emissions will increase the global effect. There is nothing antithetical to science in agreeing with all those reports instead of saying:  Ah we can't know anything, people have always been alarmists. 


I don't care about the failed curriculum of one state in one country or a badly executed push for greener energy in Germany.  It is irrelevant.  

I agree that the effect of buying stocks for most people won't affect any companies greatly, unless you buy ipos. But pushing up the stock price will make it easier for the company to take out loans to do new research etc.  So it is not completely irrelevant where you put your money.  But yeah,  it's impossible for most people to affect the stock price even a few cent"
03/17/2021,stocks,"The market is determined by last price paid, not total people who have bought. 

I agree with all of your first paragraph with the exception of saying ‘agreeing with these studies isn't antithetical to science’ although not antithical, agreeing with studies you haven't read isn't anything. It's not wrong, but it certainly isn't science"
2021-03-17 19:26:27,stocks,"Your worst picks for the last 30 days After looking at stock performance to date this month, I have a clear cut winner. I followed the Motley Fool advice of buying a company called Lemonade (LMND). It was recommended at around $140 and I bought up a bundle of shares. It dropped to almost $80 within days and has hardly broken $100 in weeks. After reading some additional DD from other Redditors, their summary that Lemonade will simply be out leveraged in an already stiff market makes sense. Being new to investing, I made the mistake of buying quickly and not following research. Just for anybody else's sake, please don't make the mistake of buying LMND. It's complete garbage and would be surprised if I break even again with the initial investment."

A thesis about a stock is only disproven in the long-term, not the short-term.

This idea of abandoning a stock because you are in the red is a terrible way of thinking and you will always feel like you are losing. Ben Graham said, ""In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, the market is a weighing machine.""

03/17/2021,stocks,"I know its a joke, but people with foresight have done that. Bought thousands of stamps back when they were 30-40 cents, now they sell them for 48-49 cents (2-4% off). Companies have to buy a minimum, but the profit margin is there with quantity."
03/17/2021,stocks,As far as I know ChargePoint is big in US but not in the world. EVBox is the biggest in EU and are coming to US. EvBox already have more than 200K Charging Stations across EU. EVBox is still in SPAC but should be Ready to merger in late Q1 or early Q2.
03/17/2021,stocks,There are a lot of good potentials in China for sure. The tensions between the US and China have been the main driver to avoid stock holdings there.

03/17/2021,stocks,I bought at 30 thinking I found the dip. Was up 15% the first day and then sold off most when it crossed 32 the other day. Maybe yesterday? Days just bleed into one another lately. Still have 100 shares I’ll let ride.

I currently hold some ABNB. Where did you read or discover this fact? So even if travel takes off again, the stock won't rise or have to split?"
03/17/2021,stocks,A new IPO and market leader in its growing business was a worst pick? Surely they aren’t your top loser. I think there is still a ton of growth especially with this desire to have investment properties. Social media is only making this more likely. I don’t even think the Airbnb market is near flooded and has plenty of growth.

As for lock up ending, gamers aren't going to stop gaming."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I kept buying during the correction. My average is $32.87 ($32.53 actually after closing the first covered calls I sold against it). Not sweating it at all. I also believe people think the end of the lock up period is a bigger deal that it’ll end up being."

03/17/2021,stocks,"It sounds like plenty of brokers accepted it. Although I don't know how that's really good PR but hey, it's up almost 7% 

Still makes me hate the company though"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yea, for some reason it's up slightly after that news which has confused me enough to hold my attention for now. After that publicity stunt I have no interest in the company long term, but with analyst upgrades I thought it might be worth holding onto rather than being impatient

Then again I'm only down 15%, so I wouldn't be too sad to rid myself of it"

03/17/2021,stocks,"I got some great picks with Motley Fool. And only one dud. And a bunch of recommendations I didn’t buy but which have proved strong. It’s the luck of the draw I’m afraid.

They do actually research into the health of companies and their overall performance on their portfolio is worth the small fee.

Like another user said, you also gotta hold on for the longer haul."
03/17/2021,stocks,Motley Fool recommends holding stocks for years not months. While you may have purchased at a bad price point that doesn't mean the recommendation was terrible. Definitely don't follow the Motley Fool if you are trading in and out of stocks.
03/17/2021,stocks,"My guy, if you


-	Are ready to throw a five year old insurance company under the bus after investing in them for **a month** when you’re supposed to be investing over the course of years
-	haven’t made more than $100 with their picks consisting of PINS, SKLZ, MTCH, ETSY, ABNB, CRWD, DIS


Then you need to either need to rethink your strategy (MF is for *investors* not day traders) or the stock market may not be for you. I have the same service, used it to guide my picks including LMND and I’ve still made *many* more times the $100 the service costs."
03/17/2021,stocks,"If Allstate, with their $45 billion in revenue (2019) is valued at $35 billion, there is absolutely no freaking way LMND is worth a fifth of that with a revenue of barely $70 million. I get that the market is all about speculation but, come on.    
These companies crack me up. LMND market themselves as a ""tech-based"" insurance company. What the hell does that even mean? Aren't all insurance companies tech based at this point in the 21st century?"

Edit: Unlike ICLN and QCLN which I dumped at one point due to a stop limit, I held PBW because its stop limit didn't trigger.  I then averaged down.  I rebought ICLN and QCLN lower and have buy limits set to average down if they continue to bleed."

03/17/2021,stocks,Good point about spreading out the risk among 15+ companies. What amazes me is many of their picks are $500+/share. So to setup an ideal MF portfolio with even a handful of stocks in 15 of their companies will probably be $100K.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Be careful. There is unlimited downside, but only a limited upside. Its best to stay away from shorting unless you really know what you're doing."
03/17/2021,stocks,"People say they are short on a stock but that doesn't necessarily mean they are actually short-selling the stock; He's probably buying puts since he said he ""sold at the dip"". 

Most brokers will not allow you to sell naked calls or borrow shares so unless he is professional (or well connected) he is probably buying puts."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Same here. If I think a stock will go down, I simply buy put. At least with buying, there's a limit to what you can lose."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I agree with this. I liked ARKK because it is made up of a lot of the stocks I like anyway like SQ and TSLA. It's around 10% TSLA so it tends to follow how well TSLA is doing. I plan on holding for a long time anyway, if I wanted to trade swings I'd buy TSLA outright."

03/17/2021,stocks,"Haha no I didn't but in that high, I bought in at 5.00 per share. It's been a roller coaster of a stock though, it goes up about 10 percent and then dips right the fuck back down. It's really strange how volatile it is"
03/17/2021,stocks,Yeah. That was my thinking too back in December too. Then it went sideways while airlines were increasing. Then their Max deliveries were low after approval. Then they had breakdowns and suspension. Week after I sold they went up 20%. Oh well. Honestly I'm more venting than being critical of my handling and I don't know if I would have done something different the next time. Their commercial customers could have easily switched to another manufacturer and never gotten back to their 2019 levels. Probably even got lucky with Covid such that there wasn't strong demand to switch to Airbus.
03/17/2021,stocks,I call BS.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Similar to Tesla, the price makes no sense when compared to competitors. Compare the current valuation and revenues vs say expedia, and even with huge growth, expedia still looks the more rational pick. Or almost any other booking or hotel chain.  

I was also really concerned to see that despite such huge growth and market presence  that it still is not making a profit. This is not unique to airbnb - many of the middle-man businesses like Uber, Deliveroo, etc, seem to have the same question. 

It may still rise, just like Tesla rises. Or it may go the other way - fall despite beating earnings estimates - this happened to many ""expensive"" tech companies, because perfect growth is already priced in."

03/17/2021,stocks,"Aaaahhhh. I don’t mess with options. They seem to be set to hover in a narrow price band for a bit, so they seem like a dicey short term pick up."
03/17/2021,stocks,Oh maybe not then
03/17/2021,stocks,"Well said. I'm also down on Corsair at the moment but it's the kind of stock that makes me think of Warren Buffet's advice that ""If you are not willing to hold a stock 10 years, don't think about holding it for 10 minutes.""  

For all the reasons you said, I think that's some good insight for Corsair. Gaming isn't going anywhere, their high margin product line appeals to professional streamers which serves as free advertising, and when you compare to Logitech I think it shows plenty of room for Corsair to grow in the long run (LOGI has a better P/E right now making Corsair stock more ""expensive"" but I believe Corsair's growth potential outweighs that)"

03/17/2021,stocks,Corsair PU and Corsair RAM is what I saw recommend 90% of the time when building my pc. Got both and they work great.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Logitech definitely beats Corsair in several categories on peripherals and smokes them in the higher end category. 

Most common combo amongst professional PC gamers is the Logitech super light wireless mouse/g pro mechanical keyboard. 

Corsair is a lot of times a decent value option for the casual pc user but they aren’t the premium peripheral company. 

They have the advantage of having their own Fans, CPU coolers, RAM sticks and Power supplies though and that’s where your main focus should be as an investor"
03/17/2021,stocks,"They are definitely getting impacted by the GPU shortages right now - not all of why they are underperforming but a part of it for sure. I just built my first PC and luckily got my hands on my stuff right before the shortages really hit. I know there are a lot of people out there waiting to build now or to upgrade until they can get the GPU they want. 

Sure - they make pretty much all the other non-essential items for the build, but it's all a chain and when one link is struggling they all are impacted."
03/17/2021,stocks,">	If you need a pc, you will end up with corsair parts. The company will grow, no doubt. As for lock up ending, gamers aren’t going to stop gaming.

You’re forgetting that there is a VERY LARGE group of people that play videogames on things other than a PC, where CRSR has very minimal presence. Also forgetting that they have competition so many other companies that make parts. 


I’m primarily a PC gamer, but have been gaming for close 30 years on all major platforms (and the game.com). In that time I’ve purchased *two* Corsair products."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm not pretending to know anything about the market. The MF picks though are typical of wealthy investors. When they talk about 800+% growth one key insight they seem to overlook is many of those stocks were bought a potential 1/100th the current recommended price. Nobody knows how many entities invested in tanked. So it's not terribly impressive to cherry pick your highlight reel of picks (and sell subscriptions to monetize those), but omit the $100K's spent elsewhere that went nowhere. His original AMZN pick at ~$2-3 was amazing to still be beating that drum seems a bit odd. Will Amazon grow still? Probably. Will it see the 10000%+ growth since inception, many seem sceptical on that one."

No professional player who is playing a shooter game is using a wired mouse. It’s a disadvantage to have a cable you have to base your mouse movement around.

The basis of their stock worth is primarily based on US military investment. Nobody has any idea where the US will stand 10+ years in the future.

2021-03-17 19:23:32,stocks,"$UPS Questions so over the last couples weeks or so ive been trying to research UPS, what do you guys think about the  it? is it good over the long term or will it only return to pre covid prices. my main though process with having an eye on it is that the world is becoming more and more about  ordering stuff online and having things delivered to them. UPS is everywhere  but looking at their stock over past years its been really stagnate so i wasnt sure if it would even be worth it to hold over a long time."
03/17/2021,stocks,"UPS is a great company, and a great long term hold.

A headwind that I can see is that Amazon is starting to peel away from fully relying on UPS/FDX with their own fleet of vans and airplanes."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I literally just thought of this after reading your post...but with the USPS vape mail ban, when you order ejuice and related online, it needs to be shipped via fedEx or UPS.

Frankly, this is what all of the shipping services need to be doing with the bump in parcel services-- Not just taking everything and overloading their networks.  For all that Amazon will eventually be delivering their own stuff in the profitable places, they pay terribly low prices and so I don't think it'll be as much of a loss when they do.   I'd still do a DD into their financials bearing mind that some of the stuff last year is going to be pretty wildly out of the norm, but I think they have a good infrastructure and are fairly solid in general."

03/17/2021,stocks,"IMHO, I would drop WFC, and plow that capital elsewhere. 

Their business practices are shady at best, and they were the only Bulge Bracket bank to fail the Fed's stress test. 

If you're in it for the dividends, then that's understandable, but otherwise I would stay away. If they can fix their practices and stop making headlines for making poor choices, then I may reconsider my stance, but for now that's where I stand. 

I would recommend UBS in place of WFC. New-ish CEO, company is coming off of 2 strong quarters, dividend is good."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It’s going to be difficult managing your allocations across that many stocks every two weeks, not to mention staying current on all of them. I’d condense down to broad ETF’s for the bulk of your portfolio and then choose a smaller number of stocks as your asymmetrical growth engines. It will be easier to manage overall and you’ll likely have reduced risk and better overall gains. You can even choose some growth and/or thematic ETF’s for more aggressive growth exposure while reducing overall risk."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It depends on your goals. I’m in similar boat and originally diversified into a bunch of stocks. But I’ve completely changed my strategy to be more aggressive. I currently have 70% of my portfolio in SPCE and $1,000 free to chase the daily dragon. Pretty much breaking even ATM. I almost pulled the trigger on UAMM the other day, would have tripled. Darn.

2021-03-17 18:42:23,stocks,"A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates **TL;DR:** I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here's a Google Sheet with the data

**EDIT: Too many people in the sheet are locking it up, so here are some direct links:** 

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

&#x200B;

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.

&#x200B;

**In the end the two I landed on were:**

[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms

[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data

&#x200B;

**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
   * What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
   * Which social media is the most profitable?
   * What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
   * How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

&#x200B;

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

&#x200B;

**Other interesting finds:**

Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasible

StockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%

**Conclusions:**

Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

&#x200B;

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Geeze this is impressive, are you still constantly updating it? If so I would love to use this.

Edit: Not sure if you saw this post, but it may be helpful to figuring out which stocks are being highly discussed on Reddit. Figured I would paste it here, maybe it's helpful, maybe it's not.

03/17/2021,stocks,"It's great to see how these scrapers actually resolve! Quick buying and selling isn't my wheelhouse, but it might be interesting to play with a little. Guess we'll see how this whole sentiment analysis holds up long term, if the GME and associates craze dies down.

One interesting thing to look at categories you've decided are viable in more detail would be a graphic display of the data (days to max, % to max, etc.) to get a better idea of the distribution and what that average means. 

Would also be interesting to know what numerical criteria you're using for step 1 - ""hasn't popped yet"". And to have a look at them to see the minimum number of different random stocks from this pool that need doing each day to acceptably minimise the chance of a loss in the back data. 

Impressive testing! And thanks for sharing this!"
03/17/2021,stocks,I'm trying to update with today's ATH data but there are so many people in the sheet it's not allowing me. LOL
03/17/2021,stocks,"This is an incredibly high quality post with research that benefits everyone. Thank you for sharing your findings!

There is a general fascination with looking for the perfect opportunity that nets a 1000% gain, but a strategy like you described is a much more consistent and efficient way of making such a gain.

Consider that, if every other week for a year you make a 10% gain, those 26 10% gains combine to a 1192% gain! And that's just every other week at the low end of the percentages you observed!

For the past month, half of my strategy has been this method, also using reddit, but I was doing it naively by manually reading through the major stock-centric subreddits. You have provided a means for me to more consistently apply this strategy, so thank you again for taking the time to put this information together for all of our benefit!"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Appreciate the share. How many of the tickers are you buying each day? Looking at unbiastock, I see 25 tickers between 250 and 500 score on 24H, of which 15 stocks are well below the average gain of 15%. So are you buying all 15 of those stocks or doing another screen to narrow a bit further? Also what is your stop loss strategy?

I think looking at change in reddit score might also be a useful metric to tighten your picks."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Hi, new trader here. Thanks for your post and the hard work!

I'm not sure I completely understand the methodology in your conclusion though. I'm trying to reproduce with current data as an example:

Going to Unbias Stock, selecting All Subreddits and Past 24 Hours comparison, $BA (Boeing) is the first ticker that seem to match your criteria:

* Sub 500 score
* Good increase in score (+21.54%)
* Small increase in price (+0.29%)

Does that mean that investing tomorrow in $BA will fall in your normal distribution that has an average increase of 15% of the stock price within 4-8 days?

Are there other criteria? should be low market cap etc?

Thanks for your help!"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Great analysis, just like anything else though, once the patterns become known, folks will exploit it and the patterns will change. What's true now won't be once everyone knows about it."
03/17/2021,stocks,This is why the big guys are afraid of retail traders. Their charade is to claim that trading is hard and only they know how to consistently crack the core. But the distributed hive mind of retail traders are already figuring out consistent strategies that the big guys probably employ.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Can you explain what you mean by ATH data? I understand ""Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet"" as getting all the tickers that reached an all time high during the day but it doesn't make sense to me? Or you're tracking if it's profitable to jump on the bandwagon after ATH hit?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Wait

> Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time.

Isn't this an argument AGAINST, not FOR buying after ATH?"

03/17/2021,stocks,"Thanks for posting this.  This is basically a more advanced method of how I've been trading lately.

Am I missing something?  If I filter ""paper trading"" by social score <500 and date < March 1st, and look at "" % change from Buy to Max"", it looks like only 43/160 (\~25%) are >=15%, even within the maximum timeframe?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Couldn’t this be a very temporal phenomenon? 

Recently Reddit stocks have gotten enough buzz that the attention alone can boost their value. That doesn’t mean it’s going to be that way forever. If we move into a bear market, a lot of Reddit users and retail traders could start losing more often than they win, lose interest and stop buying stocks in enough numbers to raise their value. 

I still think that qualitative analysis beats quantitative analysis when buying stocks retail. Big traders have a huge amount of computing power to tell where stocks are going to move day to day, but ordinary people understand their own behavior as consumers, and can think about what brands they like and trust and how that’s going to change over time better than any machine or hedge fund can."

03/17/2021,stocks,"This is really really dangerous. Back testing data to find what strategy works and then using that strategy is extremely risky. In quant land, it’s illegal.

Once you have an idea, you should backrest it to verify the idea... but don’t *find* the idea through back testing to solve for the best variables."
03/17/2021,stocks,what is ath?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yep, I'm still updating daily! I'm hoping once I have 10,000+ data points over the course of a few months some clear trends will appear"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Great thoughts! How I determine if it popped is I look at the category it's in, so let's say it's a score under 500. If the average increase at that point is 15% and the stock has only gone up 5% then I know there's a possibility for it to go up another 10%. But if it's already hit 15% then I know it'd have to be above average for me to squeeze any more profits out of it."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Word of advice, don't use Google sheets at this point.  

You'll run into problems such as the ones you're encountering

* Switch over to [GitHub.com](https://GitHub.com) (as mentioned above) 
* Use markdown so you can quickly and easily create tables

The benefit of using GitHub is that you're not only not subjected (double negative, lol) to rate-limiting, but if you do eventually pick up a programming language such as Python, others can help automate your process through the fork and pull-request model.  In addition, someone can simply fork your repository and pick up where you leave off if you ever decide to go on vacation, and you can pull in their changes via merge into your content.

The GitHub UI is fairly easy to use, but the local Git repository can also let you store CSV or XLS spreadsheets allowing others to download.

GitHub is made for large scale releases, thousands of developers and millions of people to peruse content.  And there's little to no chance of a DDoS taking them down at this point plus they offer the ability to work offline, such as a cafe in Bali with your girl."
03/17/2021,stocks,It's a really interesting piece of work and google docs are perhaps not the best platform based on the amount of interest it's going to generate. Have you considered hosting it somewhere? I am sure folks here will be happy to assist with the costs and manually inputting the data that you are doing every day. Pleade let us know if we can help you with this at all!
03/17/2021,stocks,"That's exactly my thought process too! Of course I'd love another GME surge or something similar, but I have been making consistent 10% - 20% a week gains off this low and slow method for the last month. I spread my money out so that my losses are small and my gains are cumulative."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It depends on the day and tickers. Monday I bought 5, spending $1000 each. Tuesday 3 of them hit 15% and I sold, then bought 2 more. Today one is at 10%, another at 3%, and another at -1.5%. I'll hold them until they hit 15% or until 5 days. At 5 days I'll sell no matter what.


After that I'll look at what else is popping up that day, do some Reddit searches to see what everyone is bullish on, and pick up any that seem to stand out. There's no clear sign that says ""BUY THIS STOCK!"", so in the end you still have to go by feel a little bit. This spreadsheet just narrows the tickers down to a reasonable amount"
03/17/2021,stocks,"So since it's a Reddit find and it has a score of between 250 - 500, that puts it in the 500 category. 

Based on the data that means it'll have an 86% chance (160/137) of being in the money soon. In that category it takes an average of 6 days to hit max profit, and that profit is on average 14.77%

Now, all that being said you have to do the real-world check, especially with something as big as Boeing. Skim through Reddit for that ticker and see if sentiment is bullish or not"
03/17/2021,stocks,"That's true, but algorithmic trading by companies is definitely a thing. Would be extremely surprised if something similar wasn't already going on, just in the black box of investment firms rather than visible to us. If everybody on reddit hops into this wagon that might be different, but so long as the people trying this particular formula remain a little fish in the grand scheme of things..."
03/17/2021,stocks,The nice thing about how I'm doing this is that as the patterns change it'll reflect on the sheet. I've seen a few changes already as different movements happen on social media
03/17/2021,stocks,"Wouldn’t everyone knowing this pattern just make the rise quicker, not necessarily change the outcome? Cause then everyone is buying these stocks the trying to dump at 15%, so it’ll be a quick jump then drop. 

Im new to this and not trying to doubt you just curious."
03/17/2021,stocks,And then people will move on to something new and the meta will change but this will be viable again.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Not ""folks"" ALGO does something like 95% of all major stock trades, they move billions in seconds. Need coders to update ALGO code, so you do have a bit of a ""window.""  


AKA  Dude, I'm with my babe in Bali, we're totally stoned, I'll update but give me a  weekend.  


Peace.  :-)"
03/17/2021,stocks,Was just about to say exactly this.
03/17/2021,stocks,EXACTLY. A hive mind of half a million people is more likely to be right than a team of 10 traders who do it for a living
03/17/2021,stocks,"ATH = All Time High

The reason I wanted to start tracking that is that I realized that a lot of these stocks hit a high and keep going for a few days, so there's a golden opportunity to take advantage of that momentum. So if a stock hits an all time high then literally everyone who owns it is in the green. That'll really increase sentiment that it's going to moon. But after a few days all the bag holders start selling off their stock now that they're in the green, or limit sells hit, or whatever, and the price starts to drop. So you have a few days to catch the upward momentum before it starts to drop"
03/17/2021,stocks,That's exactly what it is. There seems to be a strong correlation between stocks getting mentioned across a lot of subreddits but not getting a lot of attention yet and then popping pretty strongly later on
03/17/2021,stocks,He uses  [Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php)
03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm running into the same issue. lol Google recommended I publish it, so here's a link for that. Maybe it'll work better

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml"
03/17/2021,stocks,You da real MVP
03/17/2021,stocks,"Google does allow a site to be published. Try this site here to see if it works better. With everyone freezing this one up I may just go this route in the future

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#"
03/17/2021,stocks,"That's a good question. I considered going into more detail with the 5000+ category but didn't want to mess up my nice, clean tables"
03/17/2021,stocks,"You can download, I don't mind. I'm not profiting off it so I don't need to keep it proprietary. I just thought it'd be useful for everyone. If I download it it freezes the data so it's only useful as of today, it'd be better if you can get Google Sheets to load and just save a version for yourself"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Interesting, thank you!"
03/17/2021,stocks,Same here
03/17/2021,stocks,"You might have to wait, there are over 60 people in it right now, but here's the lowest scores

https://imgur.com/gallery/q81yrXN"
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's a sieve formula. So any score under 250 falls into the ""250"" category. Any between 250 - 500 falls into the ""500"" category

The numbers themselves are how many mentions they're getting across the different social media platforms"
03/17/2021,stocks,Mostly shares. I love options plays but for most of this I wanted to be risk averse in case the strategies weren't paying off.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Sure, and don't call me Mary"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I update it every day a little after 4:30 (ATH data) and then each morning around 9am (Sentiment data), so if you just save yourself a copy every couple days you'll be in the loop"
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's interesting the way it's working out, but what it indicates to me is that stocks that are just starting to get talked about tend to see an increase in price more often. The ones that are getting talked about a lot have probably already spiked."
03/17/2021,stocks,"One of the many useless Twitter stock ""gurus"". In this case they seem to be pretty successful just by latching on to picks that Reddit picked up much earlier"
03/17/2021,stocks,It's a site like motley fool
03/17/2021,stocks,"I've done a few, but since I'm still testing I like the freedom of shares. Once I get more confident in it I will probably use it for weeklies"
03/17/2021,stocks,It's in there. They don't get it in advance so much as they jump on the bandwagon. If you look at their scores they're only profitable for tickers with a Reddit score greater than 5000. That means it has already blown up on Reddit. That's usually when they jump on it.
03/17/2021,stocks,I think it's due to how many people are in it right now. Maybe you can save a copy in your google drive?
03/17/2021,stocks,"No, I've run into the same issue. Sometimes I'll see something that looks like a really popular stock (GIVE is one) only to find out that the scraper is misinterpreting it as a ticker symbol. When I catch those I'll delete them from the list, but sometimes they'll slip through"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I can go back and get you the specific tickers if you want, but here's my RH account for the last month and last week. You can see the rough start to the month most of us had, and some ups and downs as I was experimenting with the data and playing options. 

Then around the 8th is when a month's worth of data started resolving into something I could use. I started noticing trends popping up and trying them. As I got more confident I started committing more money. From a month ago I'm up 15% overall. 

EDIT: Old link didn't show my full month's gains, just the total on the 8th  https://imgur.com/gallery/KBdRbOI"
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's just data. It'll change as the conversations change, but one thing that's likely going to be forever now that we've entered the internet age is that people are going to talk about what stocks they want to buy.

The more people talking about a specific stock, the more likely that stock is to increase in price.  That's what this sheet is attempting to capitalize on"
03/17/2021,stocks,"It already passed through one correction. Why would it not work in a bear Market? People are still talking about which stocks to buy, and there is always something going up. If enough people are talking about a stock then there's a good chance it's going to go up in the near future, no matter what the market is like"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don't know. The data hasn't been running long enough to tell if anything here can give indicators for good long-term holds. I would be hesitant to use it to try to predict that. The only thing this tells you is what stocks are being mentioned most often across social media, and do they go up in value after getting mentioned often?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"How is it dangerous? It just parses out different data on stock movements. This is basically a summarized version of 1000 different stock charts, and how it compares to Reddit mentions. 

It's not only not illegal, I guarantee every hedge fund has something similar"
03/17/2021,stocks,So...you can't use data to come up with a hypothesis?
03/17/2021,stocks,The amount of information youre choosing to give others access to without asking anything from us is pretty outstanding of you.  Its appreciated.
03/17/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/17/2021,stocks,"Awesome, I will be using it as well!"
03/17/2021,stocks,Is this the tool you use OP? How do you tell which ones are the most discussed on reddit
03/17/2021,stocks,"Interesting, I've never looked into it before. I'll give it a shot. Thank you!"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Someone suggested GitHub, so I'm going to check that out tomorrow. It started off small but now that it is this big Google is having trouble keeping up with it"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Excellent!

There is also opportunity to squeeze a little more gain out of each position by selling covered calls (granted, many of the hyped stocks don't have options).

If the strategy is already to sell at a 10-15% gain, you can sell a covered call expiring at the end of the week with the strike price being your target sell price. 

Since you were going to sell anyways, you aren't hamstringing future gains. At best, you increase your gain by a few percent. At worst, you lessen your loss by a few percent.

Of course, you have to have the capitol to buy at least a hundred shares- Takes money to make money, as they say."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Right that makes sense. Getting from the 15 to 5 is probably the hardest part. Are you looking for catalysts, general sentiment, whatever you get an interest in? Also do you buy at market open or just once your research that morning is complete? Thanks"
03/17/2021,stocks,Super helpful. Thank you so much!
03/17/2021,stocks,AIEQ
03/17/2021,stocks,"That's great, and I'm sure it will work for some folks. But because the data is backward looking, there are always going to be folks late to the party."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Think about what you're saying though. If the rise is quicker, but folks are still waiting 4-8 days for the peak, you've got other folks saying to themselves, ""wait a minute, the gains that used to take 4-8 days are happening in 2-3."" They take their profits, then suddenly, those folks waiting 4-8 days are like, ""wait a minute, I missed it."" Folks start looking for the new pattern, find it, and again, you have others saying, ""actually, this is where I profit.""

Patterns only hold until people on the other side of the trade realize how they can beat you."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Plus, people who are EXTREMELY talented at coding and data analysis, but didn't join the finance world are able to apply and share their talents and tools with the rest of the world. This is a net win for the world"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don't know about that.  

I'd trust a medical doctor (or team of) to diagnose (and fix) a problem rather than crowd sourcing it.  

The more technical the issue, the less ""right"" more people are going to be.  We see this in the hard sciences such as physics and mathematics where leaps are made by individuals.  And also social sciences  where statistics hold sway debunking ""common"" knowledge.  

When trying to figure out a direction in which to research and spend time investigating, then understanding where the crowd goes makes sense.

Case in point is the rise in ETFs, going counter-intuitive to many experts (e.g. HFs) and crowd sourced experts buying the latest Christmas fad."
03/17/2021,stocks,Thanks! So ATH data you’re scraping is not related to social mentions but an entirely different source of tickers?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Unless it's $PENN, then it drops off the cliff :)"
03/17/2021,stocks,"You should shutdown your links, and use this instead"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Damn dude I just wanted to say as a Retail Investor just starting out for the past few months I am thoroughly impressed. Thank you so much.

Do you mind if I try out your strategy?"
03/17/2021,stocks,Looks like reddit is pretty good at picking... uh. makes sense as they are scraping from reddit as well. I didnt see what industry or company was in what grouping. It would be cool to use this long term to watch sentiment and industry interest change.
03/17/2021,stocks,Thanks for explaining!
03/17/2021,stocks,Fantastic news!
03/17/2021,stocks,"Can you outline precisely what you do to update? I imagine you're copying and pasting in thousands of tickers yourself every day, right?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"LMAO. I though as much, just wanted to make sure!"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Isn't Stocktwits more of a Twitter-like site, but for stocks? But yes, that place is full of ""gurus"" who spam it lol."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Aye, I opened the original and was able to save a copy.  Far quicker."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I think he meant bad practice, not illegal."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You misunderstand.  Backtesting an algorithm you created to see if it works is fine.  Backtesting data raw to *create* an algorithm based on what *would hav*e done best is wrong.  It's also extremely dangerous.  In other words, if you go into the backtesting trying to solve for a variable to create the maximum possible backtested return, you're breaking the rules.

The vast majority of HFT algos play on exchange/market mechanics or riskless arbitrage, not a hunt value.

tldr: **Do a walk-forward analysis on your test to check for overfitting**"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Correct.  Using the same data to develop a hypothesis that you use to test a hypothesis is obviously a huge problem as the test will always come back 100% positive.  It's an overfitting error on steroids.

It should always be:Step 1: develop hypothesis / algoStep 2: backtest algo

In this case, I don't think OP was trying to indicate a play to trade on going forward so it isn't an issue.

Look into ""walk forward"" testing to learn more about it."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Sure, go for it. I'd recommend saving your own copies just in case something happens to this or I get bored updating it (I probably won't, but who knows)

At this point it's pretty plug and play. Just copy/paste the data into the sheet and copy the formulas down, the rest takes care of itself"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Nope, [I use this one](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). It's not my site, it's just the best scraper I've found and actually scores the results, which is amazing. I'm not sure who created it but if anyone knows please give them credit"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure the best strategy quite yet, but right now what I look for is:

1. Has the price hit or come close to the average expected % increase for that score? i.e. If it's in the range 250 - 500 then the average % increase is 15%. If it has got up 5% then I can still get in, if it's already 15% then I know I missed my shot

2. Is it being mentioned across multiple subs in Reddit? If it's only popular in 1 or 2 subs then it's probably not going to take off. I don't mind if each post only have a few comments, I look for a large number of groups talking about it, not 1 or 2 large threads

3. Does everyone seem pretty bullish?


After that, I tell myself to buy at the end of the day since in general buying late in the day and selling early is more profitable over time, but I don't always have the self control to wait. I get itchy wanting to spend my money lol"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Thanks for pointing it out. Not great performance on that one overall. 

For anyone else interested:

TIL that a social media sentiment ETF, BUZ, previously existed and was shut down"
03/17/2021,stocks,"That's true, this isn't a crystal ball. But everything falls on a bell curve so this shows which categories have the highest probability of success"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Ahh yeah that’s a good point, thanks for explaining!"
03/17/2021,stocks,"You're so right. I'm a Continuous Improvement guy with multiple business degrees, so my love is in data analysis, pulling metrics, finding trends that cost companies money, etc. I never really had an interest in joining the finance field but I do love collecting and parsing data!"
03/17/2021,stocks,I wish there were more resources and groups for coders who are looking to toss their resources in tbh. Want to spend more time coding things like this but have very little idea of where to start or even pool my resources with others.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Exactly. That's from FINVIZ, which just gives hard data. So it's not sentiment based, just price based"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Good call, let me go do that"
03/17/2021,stocks,"That's why I'm sharing it! I hope it works out for you - if you figure out any use in the data that seems to work really well let me know. I've had good luck with mine, but I'm always willing to try something different if it works for someone else"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I was thinking about the theory of the Wisdom of the Masses and how 100,000 people are more likely to be right than me just hunting and pecking around the internet, which gave me the idea to start tracking this. Fortunately there are plenty of stock scrapers to help do the heavy lifting for me"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Sure! Here's the process:

1. Go to Finviz or Unbias and copy/paste that into a blank excel sheet, cut out the columns I don't need, then copy/paste as values into the spreadsheet. 

2. I remove duplicates based off columns Where and Ticker. This deletes new occurrences and ensures that the data continues tracking from the first time it popped up

3. I copy the formulas in the spreadsheet down. This gives me the current stock price for today

4. Then I copy the stock current prices and paste them as values into column N. This locks in the price on the day it was entered"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Could be, I'm only familiar with their Twitter feed"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm fairly certain there's a FINRA regulation against it, but google isn't very helpful in finding it. It's been a while since i hung up my quant hat.  It would only apply to hedge funds or other entities that manage other peoples' money, not individual investors obviously."
03/17/2021,stocks,I didn't back test anything since the scrapers don't offer historical data of how much conversation what happening on any particular day. This is real-time data that I've been collecting daily for over a month
03/17/2021,stocks,Thanks. I've read on a bit further in the comments and it's clear to me now that you're using some jargon I'm not familiar with. It's clearer to me now what you meant though.
03/17/2021,stocks,U/Swiss-Rock
03/17/2021,stocks,"oh cool, thanks, and what time frame do you like to use?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Makes sense and thanks for the quick replies. I wonder if the change in score also is a leading indicator. Looking at 48h score vs 24, I would expect that a score that is trending higher would on AVG also predict price increase. I know unbiastock allows you to check score history over past few days. I’ll look into it. 

I think the most important part of your strategy is not getting greedy. Just a few major losses can wipe out all your small gains very quickly."
03/17/2021,stocks,There was another social media sentiment ETF that started up less than a month ago. Goes by the ticker BUZZ
03/17/2021,stocks,"I’m a scientist and I do a ton of network analysis. I’ve been extremely busy lately, but I’m going to turn my network analysis skills towards the stock market once I get some free time"
03/17/2021,stocks,great job. I can tell you put alot of work into this and hope it pays off
03/17/2021,stocks,"How long does this take you to do? Do you know any Python? Feels like you could easily automate this process so it just updates as scheduled. I'm sure Finviz and Unbias have APIs, but if not, you could use beautifulsoup or something to scrape the data you need in to a table of the correct format."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Gotcha. Do you know how Unbias calculates its Reddit score? I would like to replicate your paper trading model with my own and I'm trying to establish where you get info on the tickers with them most mentions. That can't be the Reddit score, because that would just put your ""buys"" near Reddit score of 500, so you must be getting your data somewhere else!"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Oh gotcha, you’re probably right. I have no knowledge of FINRA requirements.

Also lol @ your comment being downvoted."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Why is this practice illegal though? Can you explain, I don't understand."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Here's a good article for you to read:
https://therobusttrader.com/walk-forward-analysis-testing-optimization-wfa/

if you have a month of data, try using the first two weeks to solve for the variable to see what works best, and then test that variable against the data of the last two weeks to see if that variable holds up as the best identifier."
03/17/2021,stocks,u/swiss-rock
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah, had heard about that one - the fact it's not the first of its kind wasn't prominent in it's self-hyping news though!

Did you hear much about how quick it acts and trades on sentiment?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Which I'm pretty sure that the new BUZZ is the same thing as the old BUZ, but re-branded with a push from some social media \ media personalities."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Normally it takes about 10 minutes each morning and again each night. Right now it's taking a lot more because so many people are in it. lol

I don't know Python otherwise I'd LOVE to update it. The data I pull is pretty routine, I just don't have the programming skill to automate it"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don't, unfortunately. u/Swiss-Rock could answer that, they're the creator of Unbias"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm used to it.  My last set of posts here was correcting someone who referred to ""beta"", ""alpha"", and ""sharpe ratio"" as ""technical indicators"" in a thread about whether or not technicals were relevant. (he had said that technicals were relevant because beta and sharpe ratio are relevant).  I told him that those weren't technicals - they were performance and risk measurements..  and I was downvoted to oblivion.  No amount of linking actual definitions or showing lists of actual technical indicators saved me.  

tyranny by the majority, I guess.

But in this case there is a distinct possibility that I'm wrong about this.  I could be confusing an unethical practice with an illegal practice. FINRA memos dont necessarily make something illegal. Besides, OP isn't setting up an algo, he's just evaluating indicators, and I'm being overly difficult by applying quant standards to him on a subreddit like this.  IDK why I am the way I am sometimes lol."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It fundamentally violates a few principles. First, it isn’t very safe because there’s no way to effectively test it unless you do walk forward testing. Second, your *rationale* is based off of past performance, which completely violates the main tenet of FINRA: past performance is not indicative of future results. 

There’s another illegal practice whose name escapes me. It consists of starting 16 different newsletters for a given stock. Half predict the stock goes up that month, half predict the stock goes down.  A month later, you discontinue the ones that were wrong and make new predictions for the remaining ones: half say up and half say down.  Five months in you’ll have one newsletter left that will have been right each month and can brag about being right each month. But did you actually guess right? No. You just had such a large sample size that you covered all the different outcomes. That doesn’t mean that you’ll be right next month.

Algos that backtest to solve for the best variable are the same - they found what worked best in the past and eliminated all the variables / indicators that didn’t work best. In essence, what you’re solving for at the end is that one news paper that was right 5 months in a row.

I hope this helps clear up the difference between solving for what worked best vs testing a hypothesis.  The first is pure correlation, whereas the second we *try* to find causation."
03/17/2021,stocks,"That's an interesting article, I'm a statistician by heart and a bit by degree, so I love that kind of information. The reason I'm not applying anything to it is that I am not trying to make it predictive (even if I'm using it that way in the real world), I want it to express real-world data and nothing else. 

The reddit scrapers can't tell you how much a certain stock is going to be talked about tomorrow or the next day, or how much it was discussed in the past, so any analysis other than today is just conjecture and useless in this case."
03/17/2021,stocks,"So I'm not entirely sure what specific data you grab from finviz, but have you tried Google Sheet's IMPORTHTML function?

For example if you browse here: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl

You will see a table of data below the chart

The function below uses my cell A1(containing AAPL) and Index 8(that's the Index of the table above in the HTML) and then parses out the value on Row 9 Column 4, which is Current Ratio

=IFERROR(SUBSTITUTE(INDEX(IMPORTHTML(""https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=""&A1,""table"",8),9,4), ""*"", """")+0,"""")

03/17/2021,stocks,I see.  I guess i'm so used to reading predictive threads that I assumed yours was too.  That was careless of me.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Oh wow, this is fascinating and could be a good way to automate pulling in the Finviz ATH data. 

The screen I currently use is the Screener tab with the signal of New High. Then I just copy/paste manually from the tables

03/17/2021,stocks,"Hmmm... it looks like I might be able to use this to pull stock prices each day too. Might be more reliable than Google Finances wonky functions. I  need to look into how Finviz presents historical data.

2021-03-17 18:33:41,stocks,"Understanding wash sales I unwittingly did a wash sale after repurchasing a security a day later after it was sold (as a stop loss). I repurchased the stock at a higher value relative to what I sold and thus triggered a wash.

I would like to avoid this in the future because it totally fucked my cost basis. Is this the disadvantage of having a stop loss? How do I avoid this in the future"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Don't have a stop loss unless you are planning to exit at that price without looking back.  Whether you rebuy lower or higher than the sell,  your cost basis will be adjusted if it's within the 30 days after selling at a loss."
2021-03-17 18:20:20,stocks,Thoughts on Joanne fabrics It hit the Nasdaq this week under JOAN and has hardly moved from its initial offering of $12. It’s one of the last brick and mortars my family shops at because my daughter makes clothes and family members knit. They say they like to feel and see it up close to make sure material is what they want. They also buy seasonal decorations here. Just like Michael’s or hobby lobby. Trying to determine if this is a buy. Float is low and trading volume is also really low. At $12 a share I feel like it’s a get in early price. Not sure though because they had high profits but some of that could be due to pandemic. Thoughts?

03/17/2021,stocks,"I feel like all those cloth masks that were made last year caused a one year spike in sales. That and I feel like a lot of people were exploring crafts during lockdowns. I am not sure if it is sustainable with these boons to their sales ending. Whenever I went in prior to COVID, there were never a lot of people in there aside from the line at the counter where they cut your fabric for you.

I hope I am wrong though because my mom loves that store so much and almost all of its direct competitors have died out. Hobby Lobby and Michaels have no where near the selection of Joann Fabrics."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I shop at Joann's occasionally and they have a similar sales model to JC Penney: never pay full price for anything. I have an app for my Joann coupons and walk out of there paying about 40% - 50% of the price tag.

As a upper middle class knitter, I never buy yarn at Joann's unless I'm teaching someone how to knit. I'll admit to being a total yarn snob and buy only indie brands at local yarn stores. However, there are indie yarn clones to be found at Joann's, usually trailing the trend buy six months.

As a quilter, I buy most of my thread and supplies at Joann's. I also shop at local fabric shops for Moda and other named brands, but joann's has the best selection of media related fabrics. If I want to make an item with a sports team logo or a comic book character, I hit up Joann's first.

As for stock growth protential, I'm not really sure what the future holds for joann's. Even before the pandemic, crafting was taking off. But alot of crafting festivals are going to open back up and that will take customers away from Joann's."

03/17/2021,stocks,"Chewy is a great company that is continuing to dominate and grow in a pretty saturated market. That said, I think it’s grouped as a stay at home stock (even though it’s been growing huge since well before covid), and as such will continue to dip as we get closer toward full vaccination. I just think the rotation out of many WFH stocks (like zoom, peloton, etc) will continue even harder once reopening is actually here. So I’m waiting to buy, but I think it’s a great long hold, and I certainly could be wrong and it may resume its uptrend soon. FWIW, as a long term customer I would never shop elsewhere, and a lot of their customers feel the same. They really are the best in their industry."
03/17/2021,stocks,STIC/BARK for me.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Great stock, reasonable price and time to buy, I see it as a really great long-term hold, and hitting around $120 shows there's potential, but given the times we're in I think $80 is a reasonable price, in that it's fair and about 30% discounted off from the high, however considering it's also risen very rapidly like many other similar stocks, can see it potentially coming down more. Personally I own at around $50."

The company will also offer the virtual health program as a service for other employers nationally.

Amazon Care launched as a pilot program two years ago to provide convenient urgent care visits virtually for the company’s employees in Washington state.

I hate having a blind spot in my due diligence. Already down sizably on my position. I think it's time for amazon to be broken, first they destroy mom and pop, then massive retailers, now it's other growth stocks. In the end everything will just be amazon.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Hell yes, exactly what I did. Amazon is known for spitballing and see what sticks. They may take some market share but overall this has little to no impact with Teledoc. 

The TAM of telehealth isn't even 1% tapped, there's plenty of room for growth. If anything it could help with lobbying pressure insofar as not passing any legislation that might hinder progress in telemedicine."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't worry about the Teledoc holdings, I have stocks of both AMZN and TDOC. Critical success factor for Teledoc in my opinion is their Livongo acquisition. If they focus on the chronic health market coupled with their specialty instruments and IOT devices, that's where the moat starts to build. If they try and fight Amazon head-on for the one-off consultation market then that's where it might get rough. But there's a reason why they acquired Livongo so let's see."

Ultimately competition is good.   


And I still have hesitation of loading up on TDOC, might be useful for initial screening but not much after.

03/17/2021,stocks,all full-time Amazon employees have access to a good health insurance plan starting on day 1
03/17/2021,stocks,"Have you seen the relative valuation, acquisitions and partnerships? The only way you could see no upside here is if you don’t believe in the future prevalence of tele medicine. People hate leaving their houses unless there is alcohol or food involved and it’s far cheaper for companies than traditional doctors visits or attempting to develop internal tele med infrastructure"
03/17/2021,stocks,"You realize $40 is nothing for screening? You'd be paying $300+ in person (unless you have good insurance). Bad experiences can happen in person or online. My wife is a telehealth nurse practitioner and I've been surprised at the range of services that can be provided, both acute and disease management."
03/17/2021,stocks,weren't they doing that with their cashierless stores? are those still a thing? Or are people moving to curbside delivery.
03/17/2021,stocks,no doubt. i understand it's popular and will be part of our future. i also believe that the hype is all baked into the current price

You’re the first person I’ve encountered who acknowledges the importance of telemedicine moving forward but still doesn’t like Tdoc. Only other detractors I’ve seen think tele med is a COVID play.

03/17/2021,stocks,Can you explain the reason?  I'm genuinely interested in the Japanese markets.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Back in the 1980s japan went through a similar low intrest rate bubble as us, people took out loans at low rates and bought land and stocks and the bubble got so big that the imperial palace in Tokyo was worth as much as all of California, eventually the boj was forced to raise rates and pop the bubble, the problem is that japan has little to no  imagration and a low birth rate so the economy really isn't moving its just kinda stuck in time, part of this low birth rate and imagration are due to how expensive living got in the bubble and also due to the culture, also America will have a burst like Japan but we will most likely recover due to our high birth rate and imagration as well as having the reserve currency."

2021-03-17 17:28:47,stocks,"CDX at All Time Low, Bond Yields Continue to Increase. Corporate debt during the pandemic has increased significantly - the worldwide total of which has reached about $80 trillion dollars. Due to low bond yields, new corporate bonds are typically of a lower grade. Bond traders are trading lower grade bonds due to a total decline in yield in the bond market. Even junk bonds are only giving sub 5% APR. However, they are being misreported by the credit agencies, and even highly graded corporate bonds are actually complete dogshit at the moment. Moody’s + Standard & Poor’s are not weighting variable loans for corporate debt at all basically, since it is their belief that the 10 year will not trade above 2% within the next 3 years, so even corporate bonds with a shit-ton of variable loans may be graded highly. 10 year yield hit a high of 1.68% today, and it’s yield has increased by approximately 60%-70% from the beginning of the year, so idk when the yield will actually stop increasing. 

The yield increasing affects almost every asset class, since they all need to provide an APR that is higher than government bonds (arguably the safest asset class.) So variable loan interest rates will increase proportionally (why would someone loan another money, when there is a less risky option at a higher APR?) We could see the debt bubble begin to weaken as there is an interest rate squeeze in these “Safe” corporate bonds. 

We are also seeing another potential housing bubble - real US home prices are almost back to 2008 levels, with no increase in the real wages of the (US) population, I think it is mostly due to speculation in housing driven by the low interest rate environment, and is being further exacerbated by what seems to be the first bear market in bonds in the past 40 years. (Everyone needs to get in NOW before rates increase, basically) I’m not sure how many of these loans are variable rate, but basically nothing has changed since 2008 to prevent another housing crisis - the CDX is also trading at an all time low. I think a housing bubble is less likely though, since hopefully banks have changed their lending practices, and due to government stimulus. 

Nobody knows what will happen - this is likely the first bear market in bonds in the past 40 years, and it is unlikely that there are traders who can offer insight into trading during 60s-80s. Stay safe out there."
03/17/2021,stocks,From what I’ve read the banks simply transferred that risk from the housing bubbles to corporate properties.  With the pandemic a lot of rents aren’t getting paid.  This is most likely the next bubble IMO.
03/17/2021,stocks,So... what’s the good news?
03/17/2021,stocks,"What exactly do you mean by ""this"" as the next bubble? Current market at large?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"It’s all just macroeconomic trends, they’re neither good or bad. I think Moody’s may be compromised currently though, just like in 2008, which could indicate that the bond market is fraudulent again.

I guess the good news is - as long as the government keeps pumping money into debt/equity markets, the party will probably keep going."
03/17/2021,stocks,Maybe bubble is the wrong word.  Catalyst for recession is probably more accurate.
03/17/2021,stocks,Ok lets say that a recession is coming. Whats the best way to holdout? In the global economy its not like you could hold a foreign currency as thats likely to be affected too. Own stocks?
03/17/2021,stocks,"No idea.  I know some people try to hold cash or bonds, but you have to see the crash coming.  I just hope I can afford to not have to liquidate assets if we have a bad recession."

03/17/2021,stocks,I thought the concerns were about Chinese auditors being dishonest and so you can't trust the reported financials from the Chinese side.  I'm avoiding all of them.
03/17/2021,stocks,"The general answer to questions like this:

You have to analyze the financial statements to determine percentages of revenues and business in the different countries and evaluate accordingly.

If 99% of the business operates in China, the USA segment will not impact the stock very much. (I am not sure if this is actually the case with this company.  I know nothing about it specifically.)"

03/17/2021,stocks,"There's more dishonest shit with American companies buddy.   
Plug, Nikola, RIDE says hello....to name a few. Not to mention Theranos, Enron and the piles of SPACS that turn out to be scams.   
Stop taking credit from America. Everybody knows America is number 1. That includes number 1 in scams."
03/17/2021,stocks,I don't understand why it would matter?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Gullible people thinking that US companies are all clean. I'm sure Ride, Enron and Theranos were also audited by reputable auditors."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Uh no. There is far more chinese crap out there than american. American companies are audited by reputable branches of reputable firns. Chinese companies are not.

Bring this garbage back to /r/sino, they'll eat this bullshit up."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Lmfao, is that you r sino?

""No one gets caught in China because the government is in on it, so that means nothing bad happens in China!!1!"""
03/17/2021,stocks,"Well, the ADR stock is bought in US currency, the real stock is bought in chinese currency"
03/17/2021,stocks,Oh please. Go back to your SPACS.
03/17/2021,stocks,You are an idiot. So go invest in Nikola.
03/17/2021,stocks,Why does the currency its bought in matter? Like if you had an ounce of gold it doesn't matter what currency you bought it in. If you sell an ADR you have to take USD for it and then as soon as it settles get whatever currency you want with it. Why would the underlying asset trade for different real prices in different currencies in a way that's any separate from the exchange rates?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Lol why would I invest in those, they are almost as bad as chinese stocks.

You'll be taken more seriously in r/sino, really."
03/17/2021,stocks,"> Nuh-uh you're dumb

C'mon, you can do better than that can't you?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"To buy in US stock market you have to use Gold.

To buy in HK stock exchange you have to use Silver. 

Silver rises more in value during the next 5 years than Gold does. Gold stays approximately the same during these 5 years. Which currency would you rather have, gold or silver?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Why is the price of the stock not adjusting to be the same on both exchanges? It wouldn't matter. It's like asking if a pound of brick is heavier than a pound of feathers. You're buying a stock, not the currency."
2021-03-17 16:42:15,stocks,"Can someone explain to me why bond yields are becoming so important now? What am I missing? It seems as if the 10 year bond yield was double what it is now, yet it didn't stop or slow down the bull market that went on back then, so why are people saying this is the reason for the market being pulled down? I thought the market tended to go up with inflation, so why are we going down?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Interest rates matter, and if they rise high enough there are a few theoretical issues.

1. Bonds become more attractive as an investment because they are a safe way to get a guaranteed return if the yield is high enough. No one wants bonds right now because the yields are abysmal, but if they went up enough people might reconsider.
2. Companies, (speculative growth companies in particular), have had access to basically free debt with interest rates so low which has inflated their values. If they can no longer access free money, they start to look like riskier stocks and people will rotate to safer havens.
3. There are concerns with inflation, and one of the tools to combat inflation is to raise rates. If inflation ends up being bad enough, the Fed may be forced to raise rates to combat it. This could have cascading effects, and typically you would only want to raise rates if the economy is strong enough to handle it. Given the COVID situation, it is unlikely that the economy is all that strong right now (though it might be).

On top of this, there is just a lot of uncertainty in the markets right now. It is unclear how reopening is going to play out and the market rallied to all time highs through a pandemic. It is reasonable to wonder what the next couple of months hold. We may see the economy rip back to life, we may see the effects of trillions in stimulus causing inflation, we may pay for the effects of COVID economically from kicking the can down the road last year. Given all this uncertainty, it is reasonable to see skittishness from rising yield rates as it is hard to say how things are going to play out."
03/17/2021,stocks,"The market is overreacting to everything right now because valuations are so high. There’s a sense that the party can’t go on forever and when you see the returns a lot of folks are sitting on who have held or built positions since last March (or since Dec ‘18, or since 2008) it makes sense that some of the big boys are taking some risk off the table and/or moving into Value stocks."
03/17/2021,stocks,With growth stocks you are betting on future earnings so if inflation is higher then technically you are paying for less return. I feel like the market is so fragile that any bad news can cause it to drop significantly and at the moment it's inflation and 10 years yield.
03/17/2021,stocks,Do you know why the stock market rose last year when the Fed pushed rates down so much?
03/17/2021,stocks,They have always been important.  They have just been low for a long time.  When they rise some choose them over riskier things like stocks.
03/17/2021,stocks,"There's been a 200% rise in the cost of money since summer. How could that not affect every valuation and the entire leverage of the market? 

There is also a rotation into reopening cyclical stocks."
03/17/2021,stocks,"People are failing to catch the fact that the retail investors weren't even near these numbers they are today.. Couple months ago you were looking at less than 20 percent of the market bring towards the retail investors... That number continues to grow every month now we're over 30 percent. All data up to this year in the market means nothing anymore. There is no data for over 30 percent retail investors, and stocks like $GME, $DOGE are clear signs of that. Bond yields are currently safer due to this fact, and will be until data catches up to retail, which it won't be able to considering they apes with some extra cash are about as unpredictable as you can get again look at what happened with $GME. It truly was a dumb investment at first when looking at the data at the time, but guess what one guy with a little bit of faith, and several followers proved the data wrong. Anything from this point on will be nothing but speculation...."
03/17/2021,stocks,"If I understand correctly, some companies depend on the yield because they took on debt with variable interest rates. Short-term rates probably matter more than long term rates. So if the bond yield rises, the interest on their debt goes up too. Might not sound like much when yield goes up a few basis points, but for a company that has to payoff millions upon millions of debt by 2024-2026 it matters a lot. Accordingly the value of their stock should drop because of the inherent risk of not being able to pay back the debt.

&#x200B;

For example in the [10-K of $BLDR](https://investors.bldr.com/node/13351/html) they point out the following:

>As of December 31, 2019, our debt totaled $1,300.0 million, which includes $242.1 million of finance lease and other finance obligations. We also have a $900.0 million revolving credit facility (“2023 facility”), under which we had $27.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $82.2 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2019. In addition, we also have $298.6 million in obligations under operating leases.  
>  
>Our substantial debt could have important consequences to us, including:  
>  
>**exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, and corresponding increased interest expense, because borrowings under the 2023 facility and the $52.0 million senior secured term loan facility due 2024 (“2024 term loan”) are at variable rates of interest;**

&#x200B;

That's just a small part of it and this article does a good job explaining the big picture part of it:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/yield-curve.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/yield-curve.asp)"
03/17/2021,stocks,"All companies valuations are based on discounted future cash flows.  Matured companies have more of these cash flows now and expect zero to negative growth in the future.  They like inflation / higher interest rates because it means they make more money now while they still have market share.  These are like your Dow companies.  

Tech companies, which make up a lot of the S&P500, have valuations that are largely based on future growth.  With most of their cash flows based on future earnings and earnings growth, an increase in the discount rate will significantly reduce the value of these companies.  

This reflationary trade is a reaction to rising interest rates and thinking that now its time to move money out of companies that are betting on future cash flows, and move money back into industries based on current cash flows.  Cost of cash determines which one is more appealing from a valuation perspective."
03/17/2021,stocks,Because it's a quick rise. Market will stabilize when the yield stabilizes.
03/17/2021,stocks,It’s the rate of change of yields that’s important. When yields went down to near 0 last year equities rallied. Now that yields are going back up of course equities valuations are going to be in question.
03/17/2021,stocks,"The market is looking for an excuse to sell off. Most people feel it grew far too much far too quickly. At the same time nobody knows where it ""should be."" The sell offs are good to create a new bottom. 

It's more about the future than the now. In the next 12 months most things will turn against the market rather than for it. The market is about where things will be not where they are.

Such as all the recovery stocks at much higher levels then they were pre pandemic."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's a bunch of hokum pushed by the media, but the idea is that as yields rise, future cash becomes more expensive, thus high valuations for growth stocks appear even more high, causing them to sell off as investors favor easy profit over bigger risk.

That said, as OP and others argued in this thread, stocks have increased just fine in the past at much-higher yield levels. So this seems more like an excuse for the market to sell off after a huge runup, causing a perfectly healthy correction in prices. Once this bond nonsense dies down, I expect the market to meltup as we work our way into April and beyond. Just be patient for a few more weeks, and buy any and all big dips."
03/17/2021,stocks,"inflation means essentially money now is worth more than money later

therefore, companies making money NOW > companies making money later

ie. Airlines, Industrials, Financials > tech companies making profits in 2023+

thats the simple explanation."
03/17/2021,stocks,Cuz I’m trying to buy a fuckin house!
03/17/2021,stocks,God I miss Trump.
03/17/2021,stocks,Because there are too many speculators in the market these days I.e. people that think they are smarter than everyone and over think the shit out of everything having to do with the market.
03/17/2021,stocks,Its clearly MMs.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Preston Pysh explains this insanely well on a recent pod. Highly recommended.

03/17/2021,stocks,💚🖇✏️📘because the house of cards is collapsing  ?!?!
03/17/2021,stocks,"Treasury yields are the benchmark for interest rates. As yields rise, borrowing costs for corporations and consumers rise. Also, as yields rise, the yield becomes an attractive alternative to higher risk equities. Increased borrowing costs and an attractive alternative for investors is triggering a sell off in equities. Ultimately though, we’re in a prolonged low interest rate environment. Bond yields will never be above 5% anytime soon and the Fed can/will step in to suppress yields if necessary. Equities got a huge boost from low interest rates - some of that effect wears off as interest rates rise."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I too don't understand the panic. 10 year yield has no significant impact on the market in long term, so f it and buy cheap."
03/17/2021,stocks,Inflation
03/17/2021,stocks,Exactly.... seems like the 10 yr bond yield is just an excuse for some reason... seems like they really want that to be blamed in the event of a huge market crash. Can't imagine what they'd be trying to cover for.....
03/17/2021,stocks,Well stated. I will add that higher interest rates can make stock buybacks with debt more costly and stock dilution more likely. Also higher debt service cost raise the risk of bankruptcy in weaker/ less profitable companies (think Gamestop).
03/17/2021,stocks,"This is very well started and a welcome comment on a subreddit that seems to generally misunderstand the bond market. 

I would like to add that this sensitive market isn't exactly new. If anyone recalls, the market was making nonsensical swings with North Korean fear. It would move a lot based on any news about trade wars. Remember when every Twitter twat was tweeting WW3 with the Syria situation? 

The market, and more importantly the investors always find something to worry about. Personally, I think monetary policy is one of the few things I agree with he market on, it's a big deal and far more influential than some tweet war with North Korea"
03/17/2021,stocks,"There are several rates that matter. What happened last week is that rates on Treasury paper went up because auction prices went down because bond traders were bidding less, front-running what they thought were inflation signals, which they expected to cause the Fed to raise their interbank lending rates, which would raise bank rates to the public, which would cause cash to become scarce in corporate borrowing, which would make bond traders buy less Treasury paper.

The Fed stepped up and said they don't think the signals are significant, and that they'd keep their rates and asset flows where they are...for now.

The bond traders played themselves."
03/17/2021,stocks,"This is the answer. 
Edit: the comment above, not mine


 Free or very cheap money can turn into killer money for someone who knows what they are doing.

An old boss used to say to me, “Why use the money from your savings to buy a new Chevy truck when they offer you it interest free? Keep it in the bank drawing interest and you’ll make money in the end.” While this is somewhat different, it’s the same thing.

Why use my money to buy the stock, when I can use someone else’s money, cheap, and then use the rest of my money to buy even more? Dangerous thinking I believe, but I’m not a stud trader."
03/17/2021,stocks,"The other piece I think you are missing is that many institutions hold low yielding bonds now if yields continue to rise that will trigger a sell off. The bond market is massive, larger than the stock market. If this sell off happens you could see the fed start to implement yield curve control."
03/17/2021,stocks,"But even with rising rates over the last couple months why does no one ever mention that the 10 year rate has been declining nearly 1%/year since 1980? I mean we always hear people say to ""zoom out"" in relation to stocks but the 10 year seems to be something the market doesn't care to ""zoom out"" on."
03/17/2021,stocks,Bingo bango bongo
03/17/2021,stocks,"This in my opinion is wrong, all of last year I heard valuations make sense because yields are low, if you rationalize valuations with yields you have to deal with the consequences when they rise, also rationalization valuations with yileds is really dumb but the market is normally irrational."
03/17/2021,stocks,Sort of a self fulfilling prophecy.
03/17/2021,stocks,"See that’s what I don’t get. If inflation is high, you should be investing more into growth stocks, not less. Value stocks and cash are just going to lose value with inflation."
03/17/2021,stocks,"To add to this, the overall stock market hasn't been ""pulled down"" by a significant amount do to bond yields rising.  Tech/ speculative stocks for companies that are not profitable are greatly impacted by this since they won't be able to borrow basically free money to fuel their growth.  Debt is getting way more expensive"
03/17/2021,stocks,"> There's been a 200% rise in the cost of money since summer.  

Can you explain a bit more on this? How did the cost of money increase 200% since summer? What is causing this increase?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"It isn't just explicitly variable rate debt. Companies usually refinance debt rather than paying it off, because the cash is more valuable in investment or operations or as a buffer.

But as rates rise, that refinancing becomes more expense, and not companies start to pay down debt, or, if they were already just kiting their losses, they start to file bankruptcies. Reorganizations, mostly, but then the liquidations start. It starts to affect the supply chains that every company is a part of, and business overall gets more expensive and slower. And then the layoffs start. And then it all feeds back through the loop and amplifies itself. Until it's all avalanche of failures and rising rates.

It's the Fed's job to moderate it. To put negative feedback into the system to prevent the system's natural positive feedback from driving it to destruction."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Exactly if you rationalize valuations with yields which is a stupid thing in my opinion your going to have to deal with the consequences when they rise, you can't have your cake and eat it too"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Tech stocks being at all time highs make sense to me. What doesn’t make sense are the recovery stocks that are above pre covid levels.

There is an overreaction where many babies get thrown out with bath water and then it takes some time to normalize again."
03/17/2021,stocks,You didnt think it was hokum when last April stocks started soaring despite a historic economy lockdown.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Except that nothing is cheap. Everything is overvalued currently. The only companies that should be worth 2x what they were pre-pandemic are ones that benefitted from it, but even companies that saw a -2x in revenues are still trading 2x higher than their ATH pre-pandemic.

This makes bonds really attractive as long as the yield goes up some from where it’s currently at."
03/17/2021,stocks,Username check out.
03/17/2021,stocks,"This so fucking much. Funny how bipolar this sub is.  We where in a fucking global pandemic and they where cheering rising tech stocks because the central banks stepped in and squashed bond yields.  Now they are pissed the feds words can move the markets.  No shit when you give on the free market and transition to a Fed planned economy the Fed's words are going to mean a lot.

No can even claim this caught them off guard everyone has been chanting how its a good idea to switch to value stocks for 2-3 months now.  Hell I'm up 8% on XDV.TO this last month, probably the most boring dividend ETF there is."
03/17/2021,stocks,"This in my opinion is wrong. But that’s like, just my opinion man"
03/17/2021,stocks,"High inflation increases interest rates, which can absolutely ruin growth companies."
03/17/2021,stocks,LMAO that's not what value stocks mean
03/17/2021,stocks,Value stocks tend to be consumer staples and utilities which benefit from inflation
03/17/2021,stocks,Why do value stocks lose value with inflation? Go ahead I really want to hear your answer lol.
03/17/2021,stocks,How can growth stock grow when there’s no customers sell its product
03/17/2021,stocks,"You’re oversimplifying. “Growth vs. value” really just says “this company is making money” vs. “this company is predicted to make money in the future”.

A lot of traditionally value stocks are predicted to grow because of real economic recovery as well as inflation. 

Things like commodities and their producers do well in a high inflation environment. 

Banks do really well in a steep yield curve environment. 

Oil will do really well as the economy reopens and people start traveling again. 

All technically “value” plays, but in the end, value stocks can grow just like growth stocks. The recent trend is just that enough companies in the “value” column are predicted to do well that it’s become a pattern."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Rising interest rates. The ""cost of money"" equals ""how much do I have to pay to get a dollar I can spend or invest?""

200% increase sounds big, but rates were so low it's not much in absolute terms. People are happy to agree to pay it to keep doing what they are doing."
03/17/2021,stocks,I did think it was hokum
03/17/2021,stocks,ladder attacks 😂😂😂😂😂💥🚀
03/17/2021,stocks,"Increases have been proportional to the increase in total stock market cap tho, no? Late last year the overall market seemed to have recovered back on track from before March 2020"
03/17/2021,stocks,"How long have you been on this sub, because for the last 8 months all I heard was stocks are justified since bonds suck, now they suck less and people are surprised, so are stocks high because bonds sucks or something else, cause without that rational stock valuations are just because they are."
03/17/2021,stocks,?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Not him, but if I recall correctly, doesn’t inflation negatively impact real returns when inflation is above 3%? Obviously we’re far removed from that rate, but there has to be some upper limit on inflation that would show a negative impact on even the most perfect balance sheet."
03/17/2021,stocks,"How does inflation correspond to customers not spending? Same logic applies there, why hold cash when u can buy things. 

If anything, slightly higher inflation around 4% what everyone is projecting suggests a growing economy which means consumers should have plenty of money."
03/17/2021,stocks,"True. But what I mean by “growth” and “value” is the rate of growth.

“Growth” stocks I’m considering to be stocks that are high growth/high risk like Tesla and ARK types. “Value” stocks, like you said, would be more established companies that are more stable. So they will have lower risk but the rate of growth won’t be as high.

So the logic goes that if we take worst case scenario and we have 10% inflation, you want something that’s going to have more than a 10% rate of return, and you’re probably not going to get that from more established stable companies (value stocks)."
03/17/2021,stocks,Thanks! I'm still confused.. The interest rate still remains at 0% and has been this way since March of last year. Isn't that a decrease in the cost of money since it costs basically nothing to pay for a dollar to spend or invest? I understand that the money supply is increasing because of the 0% rate and that's affecting the valuation of basically everything. Just confused on the 200% rise part.
03/17/2021,stocks,"And what did you believe caused the stocks to go up in 2020, resulting in sp500 reaching all time high in August?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"We’ve overrecovered from March 2020 and it’s largely due to people working from home and saving more money than they could pre-pandemic. If you have a majority of your net worth in the stock market, bonds are a hedge against the inevitable crash that we will have. Obviously nobody knows when it will happen though. There’s a very high probability that once that crash does happen we won’t be seeing the ATH’s we’re seeing currently for years"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Valuations made sense in the confusion because ppl thought that companies would be getting loans nearly free(less than 1% interest) so they could keep growing. It was projected to be like this by the fed till nearly 2025. Now w/ a stronger economy than everyone thought, the promise of more vaccines, and massive stimulus it is likely going to cause significant inflation. The feds job is to control that so estimates of a rate increase are now much much sooner(like end of 2022 in some ppls opinion). This means no more relatively cheap loans for all these growth companies, which will hurt their short term prospects and valuations. You’ve been stuck in an echo chamber for 8 months, but to everyone’s credit no one knew we could bounce back this fast."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Value stocks are stocks that are considered to be companies trading below what they are really worth. They're usually very stable established companies like Johnson & Johnson or Allstate. You aren't betting their future value will go up but rather that the market will realize they're currently undervalued and the stock will go up to what it should be. They often are companies that issue dividends as well, so you're getting some income that way rather than just holding to sell later."
03/17/2021,stocks,I just think why would people would spend money on goods that cost more than it is already are because inflation will cost the products price to go up even more
03/17/2021,stocks,">So they will have lower risk but the rate of growth won’t be as high.

That’s a bit of circular logic though. “Growth stocks grow more because they have a higher rate of growth.” 

You’re making the assumption that economic conditions will be favorable for these high growth companies. For example the lending rate and rising bond yields can make it hard for unprofitable companies to borrow enough cash or get enough investment to stay afloat until they can become profitable. Depending on what happens, we could see a lot of them go out of business. 

The growth vs. value trend is a helpful metric to pay attention to, but in the end the underlying companies have to do well and actually grow. 

You also mentioned risk. The risk is that the companies can go up a lot but can also go down a lot. My speculation is that this is the part where a lot of them either go down or don’t see many gains."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's not really 0%. The [Fed Funds Rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp) is officially 0-0.25%, so not all borrowers get 0% (probably only the largest interbank balancing transactions).

And that's not the rate corporations and individuals get from banks.

The Fed rates didn't go negative through the whole pandemic, so they won't now."
03/17/2021,stocks,What are the indicators that we have overrecovered? As a novice it looks like we are on to the same track we would have been without the crash? Is this why? Because instead of a natural recovery we have gone back on track unnaturally?
03/17/2021,stocks,"I know that, what I'm trying to say is that when people rationalize something for 8 months and suddenly when that dosnt work everyone just says it's not a big deal, rationalizing stocks with bonds is so unbelievably stupid, also just as a comment, the more reliant the stock market gets on low rates the worse the end result will be aka japan."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Sure, but if inflation is high, say 7-8% like a lot of people are fear-mongering, then are you really expecting higher than that level of gains from those stocks? I would say no."
03/17/2021,stocks,"That’s what I am saying. With time things will always get more expensive, so better to spend money now rather than hold off and buy it later when it’s more expensive.

Then again, people and investors aren’t exactly rational."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Fair enough. I happen to believe that interest rates will remain low for the foreseeable future. A slight increase like we’re seeing now might make people panic in the short term, but the fact is that we are still and will remain near all time lows."
03/17/2021,stocks,My point is that shouldn't the slashed funds rate represent a decrease in the cost of money and not an increase?
03/17/2021,stocks,"The red flag is that we’ve been in a pandemic since March 2020 and there’s companies that are literally bleeding dry, yet they are trading at twice or more of what their ATH was before the pandemic. This should only be the case for companies that had increased revenue due to the pandemic, yet its literally everywhere. Try zooming out more than a 1 year chart, 2 year and 5 year charts really highlight it."
03/17/2021,stocks,Higher than growth stocks in the same environment. You're basically looking at the investment environment of the 70s and 80s.
03/17/2021,stocks,"This isn’t natural inflation. Because our wages isn’t increasing, but the things we buy are like essential goods. Since we have less spending money on luxuries"
03/17/2021,stocks,"It is, but other rates are up. Treasury bond rates since a few months ago and mortgage rates since the beginning of the year, for instance."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Right but as a whole the market is about on par as it would have been without the pandemic. Would that not indicate that there will be a sell off of the overvalued stocks into others? I get the argument of share value vs revenue, but with so many companies being hurt by the pandemic, which is slowly coming to an end, could this not just be value based on the expectation of recovery?"
03/17/2021,stocks,Fair enough. I just happen to think the traditional thinking is wrong when it comes to inflation and investment. That doesn’t mean it’s going to change any time soon though until the big fish change their strategy. So you’re probably right.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Wages almost never go up with inflation, if they did, inflation wouldn’t be so scary. But you’re right in that things will get more expensive"

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lands-end-crowdstrike-plug-power-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow futures steady as bond yields rise but Nasdaq futures fall

> * Dow futures were steady Wednesday even as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a new 13-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve’s post-meeting release of new economic and interest rate projections and Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference. However, Nasdaq futures slumped about 1%, in step with recent pressure when bond yields rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday broke a seven-session winning streak, retreating from a record high close. The S&P 500 also fell from a record close, breaking five straight days of higher finishes. The Nasdaq bucked Tuesday’s trend and finished higher.

*****

> # 2. Powell needs to tamp down inflation concerns while defending policy

> * As bond yields rise on concerns about inflation, Powell needs to convince traders that easy current Fed monetary policy won’t overheat a recovering economy that just got another Covid stimulus boost. Central bankers get a new batch of housing data to consider at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect February housing starts to drop 2.5% following a 6% decline in January. Building permits for February are seen falling 7% after January’s 10.4% gain. The Fed concludes its two-day March meeting Wednesday afternoon, with no one expecting any change in rates from near zero or any shift in the extraordinary measures designed to support growth during the coronavirus pandemic.

*****

> # 3. 15% of U.S. adults fully vaccinated; Trump touts shots to supporters

> * New daily Covid cases in the U.S., down about 80% from early January, continued to fall as immunity protection increases from vaccinations and high levels of prior infection. More than 15% of the U.S. adult population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, while heading in the right direction, health officials say those vaccination numbers need to go much higher to stomp out the disease, which killed an average of 1,285 people in America over the past seven days, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

> * Former President Donald Trump urged people to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying he would recommend it to “a lot of people that don’t want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me.” However, in a Fox News interview Tuesday night, Trump acknowledged that people were free to decide for themselves whether to get shots.

*****

> # 4. White House sets low bar for Thursday’s U.S.-China meeting

> * The White House is setting low expectations ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan’s first face-to-face meeting with their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday. According to a senior Biden administration official, the two sides won’t deliver a joint statement and no major announcements are expected.

> * Reflecting Washington’s concern about the erosion of Hong Kong’s rights, the U.S. sanctioned an additional 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over Beijing’s ongoing crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. China said the new sanctions expose America’s “sinister intention to interfere in China’s internal affairs, disrupt Hong Kong and obstruct China’s stability and development.”

*****

> # 5. Uber grants UK drivers worker status after losing labor battle

> * Uber will reclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers, in the wake of losing a major labor battle there earlier this year. Under the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers in the U.K. will get some benefits, including a minimum wage, holiday time and pension contributions. However, they won’t receive full employee benefits. In a SEC filing, Uber said its U.K. ride-hailing business accounted for 6.4% of all mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shares of Uber fell more than 2% in U.S. premarket trading.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, March 17th, 2021! :)**"
03/17/2021,stocks,"For tech stocks getting hit by bond yields - is there any chance they'll reverse course and move upward after the fed comments? Slim to none?






I'm trying to average down as much as possible a couple positions and wondering whether how I should go about timing that today"
03/17/2021,stocks,Someone needs to tell Trump that the dead can't get vaccinated.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes, my biggest question also lol."
03/17/2021,stocks,What time is the speech?
03/17/2021,stocks,literally right before market close.....
2021-03-17 16:38:22,stocks,"What would you guys do? So, I put most of my free money (outside of my 6 month emergency savings) into my brokerage account. I treat it as a savings account - I know that is probably bad. I don't have a ton in there I only make a modest (60k yr) salary. 

I keep three ETFs since I can't be fussed to do proper DD since I'm not super smart. I do CNBS - $2500, VUG - $2500, and VTI - $2500. I try to keep them all equally invested. 

My roth only has one holding VG 2045 retirement fund. Just throwing that in here for a more complete picture.

I typically use this money in my brokerage to fix stuff around the house pay for vacation etc. I try to keep my emergency money for job loss or catastrophic event.

Anyway, CNBS I feel like is being too heavily influenced by meme stocks eb and flow. Would it be smarter to cash out at a slight loss and just reallocate to VOO? 

This money sits most of the year unless something major happens, but would like some more thoughts. 


Thanks!

Edit: I also considered cashing out CNBS for MsOS knowing that legal weed in NY is around the corner.

Edit 2: my friends also make fun of me for exclusively investing in ETFs. But I get too paranoid at individual stocks. I don't like feeling like I need to check them daily. From what I've read and learned in books the average person only averages 8-10% which is what most etfs do, so why bother? I don't make enough to do wide bets on stocks.

Edit 3: wow a silver! For this? Thanks! I didn't realize this was an award worthy post, but ty!!"
03/17/2021,stocks,Why so heavy in cannabis?
03/17/2021,stocks,I agree that ETFs are the way to go. I do 80% of my portfolio into ETFs and the remaining 20% into individual speculative stocks.
03/17/2021,stocks,"If you use it like a savings account for actual expenses, then you're better off investing in ETFs or stocks that are stable. I would say to watch out for a market correction, but you have 6 (!!!) emergency savings funds. I think you'll be fine."
03/17/2021,stocks,I like VT or VXUS for international markets. No king rules forever. Lots of development going on in other markets. Good to have a piece of it for the long haul IMO.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Short term bond funds are a low risk way to keep your money active but liquid. I had about 7% of my account in VBIRX until recently, and treated it like an extension of my high yield savings account. After assessing my savings, I realized I had enough cash in the bank that I didn’t need to also tie up more in VBIRX, so I sold out of that fund and put the proceeds into intermediate tax exempt muni bonds, which are still liquid but a bit more volatile.

tl;dr bonds"
03/17/2021,stocks,"You'd fit right in over at r/Bogleheads, they're good folks.  Think there will be a push towards legalization soon which might be an ideal time to get out of CNBS while in the green, the last few weeks have been very hard on that fund but even my state (Wyoming, for pete's sake) is suddenly like 'oh we need money, maybe we should think about this a bit' so you might find a nicer exit point fairly soon.  

&#x200B;

MSOS isn't bad, but the whole industry is one giant swing right now.  Most of the industry news lately has been good but there's still some pretty jagged swells and dips."
03/17/2021,stocks,6 emergency saving accounts. Personally too much for me may not want to ask what I would do. I’d cut that down to one.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Good for you!  You understand your weaknesses (whether it's lack of interest, time and even money) and focus on doing what you can with what you have.

* Investing in ETFs for the long run is certainly your best play.  Someone stated that VTI over 10 years returns 12-14% when you include the dividends.
* Having VUG and VTI (2/3rds) is certainly fair but I'd consider it high without knowing your cash position.  You'd be risking growth by having too much in VTI/VUG and potentially get bored and increase your risk.
* CNBS ... that's what I would consider either an individual stock (e.g. TSLA) that you like, or FU money you don't mind losing.  

50 .. 60% in a long term ETF that not only is going to grow, but not crash to zero and pay you dividends?  ZERO wrong with that in my opinion.  

Do not discount your cash position - it's also an investment opportunity so you want to build it up and tear it down as you decide to invest.  If you lose your job, you are going to deplete it before your portfolio, and vice versa while you work.  

* 10% cash
* 50% ETFs for long term growth
* 20-30% for that long term (>1 year) investment horizon
* 5-10% in that FU money to buy GME or individual stocks / gambles.  

If you have 6-months saved ($5K as per your expenses) you should be able to plow money into your portfolio until you get to $50K.  If you don't have that $5K, build that up while you're also increasing your portfolio size but not going overweight on the cash reserve, as that's very boring."
03/17/2021,stocks,It's weird to me that I make 1/4 of what you make but invest the same amount if not more..... Wtf
03/17/2021,stocks,"Just like weed stocks, and it's becoming legal all over so figured an ETF instead of individual stocks would be a safer bet?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I'd love to do stocks  - but I'm just not good at interpreting all the info. Plus, seeing that advisors and managers rarely beat out the marker I figure what chance do I have?

Of course I see the people who made millions on tesla and GME and think damn, wish I did that, but I don't have the skills they did."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Good idea, I haven't anything in international markets. Maybe that's the move."
03/17/2021,stocks,I'll check it out...looks like it stays fairly stagnant. Going 3¢ either way over 5 years seems like a lot
03/17/2021,stocks,Oh sorry that should say 6 month. I'll go edit it
03/17/2021,stocks,"I have 12k in my 6 month emergency fund. That would pay my mortgage, car insurance, utilities, food etc. 

I have another 6500 in liquid cash, and I have 7500 in my brokerage. I'm just trying to figure out  the best way to invest outside of my roth (I do max to it yearly). 

So you think I have too much in VTI/VUG?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I guess I'm confused? I max out my roth, and have 7500+ in brokerage investing.

You make 20k a year and invest more? So that means you make about 10 an hour.

So you're investing roughly $1000 a month based on what you say. Which means:

1. You live with your parents
2. You have a significant other paying your bills
3. You live in an apartment with way less than 600 a month in rent and don't eat

Not sure why you wanted to try to weird flex. Maybe I'm misreading it, but seemed like an attempt at being passive aggressive, followed by not thinking."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Here's a lesson of what happened in Canada.

The weed stocks went to the moon before legalization.

The week after, they crashed."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah definitely, maybe sell like 40-50% of that to put in VOO?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"For every person that’s made a mill on those 100’s lost a ton. 

You’re smarter than you’re giving yourself credit for. I really like your disciplined approach to strive for realistic returns. Stay the course!"
03/17/2021,stocks,"You're right - even the hedge funds and professionals who do research all day don't have any edge. ETF's beat almost all of them in the long run. Their skill isn't stock-picking, it's a combination of good salesmanship and luck."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Just something to think about, there isn’t anything wrong with making money on the same stock twice :) basically for what it’s worth I’m 21 and kinda out of my comfort zone here, but I hang with the 5-10 companies I know by heart with how they move and their patterns, and just reinvest at the appropriate times for them. I’m not sure if this helps at all, but I haven’t seen it mentioned yet and figured it might not be a bad shout! 

Good luck dude, it’s consumed a part of my brain since the start of the year lol. Give yourself some more credit in the brains department ;)"
03/17/2021,stocks,👍🏼
03/17/2021,stocks,"Short term bonds are pretty steady as far as investments go, but they aren’t completely immune from shocks. For example, VBIRX has lost 1/2% since the beginning of 2021. My guess is this is due to the bond rout that happened in February. I was still up over several years when I sold out, and made more money than if I’d parked the money in a savings account."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I own a condo and live with a roommate

550 mortgage
301 condo fee
114 insurance 
100 electric bill
79 internet
100 gas
200 food
(-500 roommate)

That's 10k on bills yes

I don't go on vacations. I don't upgrade my utilities, I don't have student debt. I don't have kids

I would fucking kill to have 40k at my disposal every year

You should be flexing. You have all this money that could be 4x-10x in 10 years"
03/17/2021,stocks,Good call - yeah I sort of wanted to stay invested till NY legalized recreational marijuana and then cash out. But wasn't sure if I should stick with CNBS or swap to an American MsOS etf
03/17/2021,stocks,"Here's a lesson of the difference between Canada and America. 

Canadians LP's are bleeding cash and not accelerating growth. American MSO's (particularly the big 4) are generating very strong revenue, with many having positive EBITDA and growing at rates above 100% YOY, without half of the states being legalized yet. Canada population is about 1/10 of America population. California population is approximately equal to Canada population for comparison. TAM is explosive for US compared to Canada.

For example: CRLBF could very well generate 1 Billion in Rev in 2021. Their market cap is sitting right near 3 billion. Growth is expected to be near 200% yoy for this upcoming Q. Find me a stock that is generating that much revenue with a market cap so low."
03/17/2021,stocks,I'm open up to doing whatever. I just am thinking CNBS and weed in general isn't worth it at this point.
03/17/2021,stocks,I appreciate that. I just want to retire not poor.
03/17/2021,stocks,Not all LPs are bleeding cash. Cannabis is where I'd advise against an ETF and just recommend Aphria or Canopy. An ETF is a poor idea if the industry as a while is relatively unhealthy while there are clear leaders in that industry.
03/17/2021,stocks,How much is your loss/ what did you buy at?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Have you ever used an investment calculator to look at what your money will be worth when you retire? Assume your annual 7-10% and things look great.

03/17/2021,stocks,"You're entitled to your opinion, but I disagree. Just look at how much CGC lost in 2020. I'm pretty sure it was over 1 Billion USD (1.3 C). I don't follow APHA as much, but they are acquiring TLRY. I personally thought TLRY was the best bet of the Canadians. APHA and CGC also don't have much growth potential in the US, even though everytime there's news in the US the Canadians some how go up. It's because US names must be OTC until MORE/SAFE are passed and RH, many funds and institutions can't buy OTC. For 3-5 years, US has the potential for highest growth, then for 5-10 years, Europe. 

I also disagree that MSOS is a bad idea. Although their ETF has a high expense ratio, it holds the Big 4 (5 if you count Terrascend) and all of those Big 4 are likely winners. Just look at GTBIF's earnings today. 546% Growth annually Yoy. 374% EBITDA growth YoY. That's INCREDIBLE. And they are hampered by headwinds. Those headwinds will soon become tailwinds though, once MORE/SAFE are passed. Plus MSOS you can buy options. OTC we can't buy options. I'm holding a lot of MSOS leaps atm. Concentration in the big 4 is likely a better bet for shares, though. I personally like Cresco who is trying to be the PEP of Cannabis."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Like $148. Nothing major or to worry about.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Aphria acquired Tilray and Aphria was in far better shape than Tilray.  Actually, when the merger was first announced us Aphria people were a bit upset as Tilray's finances are kind of dogshit.  But I feel now that merger is necessary due to all the market catalysts, and Aphria's superior management should get that ship righted especially after cost-saving synergies (ugh, I hate that word).

You mention Europe, which is an important reason why I'm invested in Aphria.  Aphria/Tilray are making solid moves in Europe and (less importantly, though still there) Latin America.  I understand the market demand is less overseas as it stands now, but I expect that to continue to grow over the next decade, especially since American culture exports itself so well in media--legalized weed will acquire a new, habilitated image worldwide, I think.   I think we are in agreement on this point, and Aphria/Tilray should enjoy a huge first mover advantage there.  I still would not discount their presence in the USA, though.  They have expressed an intent to make heavy acquisitions to move into the USA.

Actually Aphria is the only MJ company I really like particularly of the Canadian ones, but despite how I feel about the other Canadian LPs I feel Aphria is a very solid and well-run company.  I also am quite sure Aphria/Tilray will be acquiring American companies to further move into the US space, just like they acquired Sweetwater Brewery.  

I wasn't directing my comment about ETFs at MSOS but more ETFs like MJ and YOLO, MSOS is probably the **only** weed ETF that's worthwhile!  I mean to say if you're going to go MJ or YOLO you might as well cut the fat away and just go with Aphria (soon ""Tilray"" but mostly in name only) and maybe Canopy.  The rest of the Canadian LPs are too poorly managed and grew too fast, too quickly.  I'd suggest you look into Aphria as well."

2021-03-17 16:21:42,stocks,"Are we sure all these sentiment scrapers are good? Is anyone concerned we keep seeing these sentiment data scraping posts? I have been tracking stock performance of some of the original ones posted on here and it's terrible...but if you check the website or scraper tool they have moved the goalposts, ie restarting the fund or changing the cost average. 

Frequent mentions does not equal positive gains. Ever since the GME hype, I am leery this kind of sentiment  information and the positive feedback loop of creating more mentions and more people buying is extremely valuable to parties interested in short positions. It provides nice research on stocks people will likely buy with no DD other than it was mentioned a lot. And coincidentally many of these stocks are already your classic meme stocks technically overvalued.

I have been tracking roughly 400 tickers that have appeared on 48 hour and weekly sentiment lists and it's performance is inferior relative to index funds over that period. Of course there are some winners but I've yet to have any top 10 or 20 list for a period outperform an index. 

Are we sure this sentiment scraping stuff isnt just playing into the exact data shorty wants? You get replies in the comments like ""this is genius!"" and ""I'm going to make so much money"" and check the acct and it's often less than a month old only active in stock subs with a couple comments. 

Be careful folks. The sentiment data may identify stocks worthy of further DD, but the amount of euphoric responses to daily sentiment scraping posts worries me we have a lot of short research occurring on here disguised as help."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I don’t mind them. They’re interesting insight into what the subs are looking at. I don’t take them as recommendations to but the stock however.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Hi,

**I run HypeEquity**, a Sentiment/Financial analytics tool.

# You're right, most of us are bullshit. It's infuriating.

**Here's why:**

People are using tools like PRAW and are simply shitting out content by counting CONTAINS of Ticker symbols.

**Example:**

""I LOVE GME""

This can be construed in a number of wrong ways.

LOVE is not the ticker, but systems may pick it up as Lovesac

GME is the ticker in question

""Number of mentions or score"" data points are simply looking at the above ""LOVE"" comment and attributing upvotes, which continues to obscure the data.

**Some sentiment systems even do things like add multipliers on Flair**, *which is just more bullshit* and continues to obfuscate the data.

\--

# It's because people are being lazy.

It's a symptom of people who see the news and want to make a quick buck or build a following.

In fairness, our system has sometimes fallen over due to the obscurities of the English language or maybe a particular lexicon difference between subreddits (""to the moon!"" etc).

People just aren't spending the time to do it... right.

\--

This is something I'm acutely keeping an eye on, we're even releasing a new Sentiment Engine 2.0 update in a matter of days to squash and improve upon our ML model. For context, we almost released last night and I said No because I found odd tickers that shouldn't exist or were mis-represented.

We're now going to look at the individual word choice (is it a noun, adjective, placement in the sentence structure).

We're looking at contextual content in surrounding comments (did someone mention GME in the OP and now someones responding to the OP)

# How I plan to be transparent

I'm actively writing up a post on this in our subreddit because it's a large update and I think people need some transparency to better believe in the numbers.

I'm going to explain how we pull in data, our parameters for it, and the difference between scraping content and then evaluating it for analysis.

Edit: [Post is now up](https://www.reddit.com/r/HypeEquity/comments/m7cttm/hype_equity_beta_update_4_a_monumental_change_to/)

# Otherwise it's just more bullshit."
03/17/2021,stocks,"As a n00b, I though jumping on those mentioned often and looked good would be ideal for long term gains. But then as I start looking deeper and seeing some stocks have spiked with the influx of new traders at the end of Feb (meself included) I've switched to doing more flips, instead of holding. So now when looking at stocks mentioned I evaluate on the day-trade potential. So yes shorters love the scrapers."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You are completely right, but you should highlight what you add in your last paragraph earlier in your post!"
03/17/2021,stocks,"A few thoughts:

* The usefulness can vary based on where they are scraping and how they compute sentiment (use of and configuration of NLP, for example).  Few share their ""secret sauce"" so difficult to determine effectiveness of their methodology.
* The analysis provided caters to the growing generation of young retail investors who tend to focus on posts which garner a higher engagement rate (likes, comments, upvotes, retweets, etc) instead of relevance of content.
* Macro trends tend to be more useful yet I haven't found anyone offering longer term analysis.
* Related to above, I haven't found anyone offering correlation analysis - sentiment compared to volume, price, short interest, or as a function of company news (earnings reports, hiring/firing announcements, insider transactions, etc).  I feel this would be far more useful than stand-alone sentiment analysis.

Personally, I find the analysis as interesting but not pertinent overall to my DD."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I think they're interesting, personally. There can be some good data coming out of them. The top 10 total or whatever is kind of useless because it's obviously going to be the usual. Ive seen some that show % change or only tickers that have suddenly become mentioned multiple times which I think would be a much more significant indication of potentially significant movement. I agree that it'd be possible to develop hype of a ticker through faking the data but it seems like it'd easily be noticed because there's so many different scrapers out there collecting data that you could reach a consensus. I'd be more concerned about bots creating fake hype by commenting which would then affect the scraped data"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Ive always thought of them as fun market recaps, and maybe an idea generator at most. Imo, theyre kind of a terrible tool to base your investments on. Most of the time a stock hits that list because its already going through a rally, so youre already late to the party by the time it pops up on reddit. Youre beyond fashionably late by the time it hits the front page."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Their marginally interesting. I don't understand why it matters all that much. Buying a company because you're predicting public sediment is a fool's errand. Buy a company because you're predicting the company in absence of the market.

03/17/2021,stocks,"I’ve always thought something like this would be most useful for indicating which options would be the best to write OTM covered calls on.  I wonder if there’s a correlation between reddit mentions and option pricing compared against a stock with a similar beta and no reddit mentions. 

Reddit loves calls and I imagine the volume change would be far more noticeable in the options market.

A fun hedge play would be buying a “reddit” stock, writing a call, and then shorting a non reddit stock of the same beta / industry (as highly correlated as possible) and buying a call with the same distance from strike / date.

When I get more time I might test that out. It’s fun to think about.  It could go sideways pretty easily though."

03/17/2021,stocks,"Yup!  It was called NLP and we used it in customer satisfaction sentiment.

* ""Item was great!""
* ""Item arrived broken""
* ""Item wasn't broken""
* ""Item was good, for the most part""

The NLP aspect finds associations (negative and positive) along with strengths (e.g. ""broke"" vs ""very broke"" vs ""F'd up"") to give you a sentiment with regards to the transaction and potentially with key items within the sentences.  

When we deployed and modified this technology, about 8-10 years back, it was in the early stages and could be replicated in code with a hash (we tried to grow our own).  

Today, it's more refined and should be using external databases for contextual relationships.  

Sentiment is good, in fact it's great - but it's up to the ML (and reviewers) to tweak the code / context to figure out what needs fixing and I wouldn't rely 100% on it for my DD."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I will try. 

The market is functioning as a group of independent actors all trying to price assets the best they can. If a short seller is artificially driving the price below the real market value, you have a discount you can take advantage of. You, a member of the asset pricers are seeing a price below market real market value. The real price is asymmetric to it's trading price. (for shorts it's vis-versa) 

People would argue that driving the price down hurts shareholders, but it's the opposite. When I buy a stock, the only thing I want to happen is for the price to decrease. The price increasing doesn't help me until I realize the gains. 

The most important thing to remember in the market is that you aren't buying prices, you're buying shares. Shares, independent of the market are inherently valuable. 

I own a ton of Apple shares. The greatest thing that could every happen to me financially is if Apples price became asymmetric and dropped to 0 for more than my lifetime. Yes, I would lose all of my investment, but I would also be able to purchase all of Apple with zero dollars. I don't care if I can't sell the shares later because the intrinsic value if the company is unbelievably high."

I was always expecting it after reading this [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921000518/tm211407d1_8k.htm) as they claimed AMZN purchased in excess of $200M in goods and causing execution of their warrants with value greater than $400M.. There was no way AMZN purchased that amount since they only sold 25,000 forklifts spread out over 10 customer per their investor presentation.

I am curious if AMZN sold the shares after execution, even at this price it would be a nice profit for them.

SEC needs to investigate them - they essential trade warrants for sales and no real revenue."

2021-03-17 15:18:32,stocks,"Applying Occum's razor to the stock market Looking back at the last year on the stock market, I see a bubble. Many people on this forum confidently proclaim that there wont be another crash anytime soon And that buying this dip is the correct thing to do. That leaves us with 2 possible scenarios.

1st scenario, were in a humongous bubble based on the valuations pre-covid to current valuations and it is currently in the beginning of a major crash. 2000 dotcom crash charts almost perfectly match our current charts.

2nd scenario, pre-covid the entire market was wrong on the valuations for the past several years on stocks.  During the pandemic, the public and institutions became lucid to the fact that tech, gambling, weed, ev, ecommerce, btc miners, chinese stocks etc  were all wildly undervalued and so the market rightly corrected for this 200% - 1000% deficiency in market cap over the past year. Sub 10 P/E ratios were also wrong and P/E of 30 - 170 is appropriate for the first time in history.

Occams razor, the simplest explanation is usually the right answer.

Am i to believe that the market was wildly wrong in undervaluing stocks like zm, shop, aapl, tsla, BLNK, DKNG, PENN, TLRY etc over the last several years? What does everyone think?

edit: Since the dawn of the republic, has an industry or sector ever gained 200-500% in one years time or less and held that value? ie not a crash"
03/17/2021,stocks,Occam.
03/17/2021,stocks,"So much has changed between those two times, why would you expect valuations to be the same?"
03/17/2021,stocks,I didn't realize we had so many fake online companies trying to be the next AOL in 2021.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Re: ZM, Occam’s razor would suggest the market was right to value ZM low before the pandemic and high now. We just spent a year away from everyone with no choice but to force ourselves to incorporate it into our lives and our businesses. Makes perfect sense to me. 

Re: AAPL, it just broke $100bn in revenue in a single quarter. It’s massive, but it’s still growing. Why can’t it rightly be more valuable now than it was a year ago? Razor seems to back reality here too."
03/17/2021,stocks,"This is a false dilemma. It ignores a changing landscape as a possibility. 

I believe there will be movement of money within the market (sectors and stocks continuing to fluctuate while the market rebalances), rather than money leaving the market. In fact, I expect that awareness of the market and increased savings rates may result in more money moving into the market. 

I’m calmly buying the dip."
03/17/2021,stocks,Maybe some fundamentals changed (e.g. gov aid) and it's a 3rd option
03/17/2021,stocks,"I’m not sure. 

Tesla’s valuation grew at a 74.1 percent annualized rate over the last ten years. 

At the same time, its revenue grew at a 75.1 percent annualized rate.  

So basically you’re seeing a company grow its market cap in line with revenues."
03/17/2021,stocks,Just look at today's market! The FED will announce something. Most likely that there will be no policy changes in the near future. Yet SnP 500 is down 0.6% and NASDAQ 1.2%. This shows barely contained panic right now. The FED will announce early afternoon that they are not increasing interest rates and the markets will swing wildly into green territory. Simply that a totally neutral announcement has this effect on the markets shows that we are one bad news away from mass panic selling. And eventually some bad news will come.
03/17/2021,stocks,Stopped reading after I saw the word CUM 😎🙏🏻
03/17/2021,stocks,Can not agree more. A crash is coming.
03/17/2021,stocks,"You didn't mention monetary policy. Our monetary landscape is very much different from 2 years ago. I remember saying in March of last year that if Covid turned out to be a nothing burger (which in many ways it did) that the markets will skyrocket because of fiscal and monetary policy. That's it, literally nothing else would need to happen to cause equities to sky rocket. That's exactly what happened

However, at these evaluations, I only see 4 options for the market

1. We have a crash in the next few years

2. We don't have a crash but our projected 10-20 year returns fall well below average 

3. Human ingenuity increases productivity to where the these companies actually do justify their evaluations with healthy growth 

4. The world continues with absurd monetary policy that will screw all younger generations for year's but make the asset markets continue to be hot. 

Personally, I hope the market crashes and the government offers no bailout. But we all know that wont happen"
03/17/2021,stocks,We have J. Poww to thank for this.
03/17/2021,stocks,"We're nowhere near dot-com valuations.

Look at S&P returns over the past 2 years when adjusted for $DXY (Us dollar vs basket of foreign currencies)

we have barely climbed.

Then tell me which tech companies in 2000 were making 100 billion a QUARTER like AAPL and AMZN are now doing.

comparing this market to 2000 is just lazy and doesnt make any sense."
03/17/2021,stocks,What has changed to make those companies worth double to quintuple more?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Not that I agree with the OP’s thesis, but we absolutely have so many companies trying to be the next Tesla that may not be fake, but certainly have high valuations despite making no vehicles at the moment. You can definitely see the parallels there."
03/17/2021,stocks,"RE: ZM

Biden’s saying the vaccine will be available to every adult in the US by May, who knows if the current work from home economy will last after that. Wouldn’t Occam’s razor suggest that if the pandemic weakens, so does the boost to Zoom’s value?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"those were just simple examples. Look across the board, BLNK was a penny stock, the other EV companies were in the same boat. I could go on and on. If anyone can give reasonable explanation as to how the market ""missed"" by 200-500% on a ton of stocks Im all ears."
03/17/2021,stocks,"ZM is more of a value now than before the pandemic from a multiples perspective. 

It’s now has some of the best earnings multiples of any SaaS company.  It’s similar to Paycom in earnings multiples."
03/17/2021,stocks,So wouldnt that lend creedance to the bubble theory?
03/17/2021,stocks,This time is different is the least likely explanation.
03/17/2021,stocks,so are you saying because of stimulus's its a bubble?
03/17/2021,stocks,I cant shake the feeling were in the top of the crash right now.
03/17/2021,stocks,500k people dead after mask mandates and lockdowns is nothing?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Oh like so many things. So many things. The presidency changed, a rare US gov with near-control of government, a few trillion dollars of fiscal and monetary policy, technologies were invented and others died, huge numbers shifting to remote work and remote schooling, a global pandemic... I could rattle things off for days.

You shouldn't expect valuations to remain constant. They're always in flux. At different stages in the business cycle and as inflation changes the attraction of future growth looks more or less attractive and thus monetary & fiscal policy can cause large shifts even when the fundamental business has stayed the same. So much can change. So much has changed."
03/17/2021,stocks,Do they currently make up the majority of the S&P 500? If not they I wouldn't worry about it.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don’t think that assumption is correct. Yes, we will use zoom less on a whole, especially kids returning to in class learning. But zoom has become part of the business world now. It has proven to be a useful tool that will not be going away."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's not just the pandemic that will decide Zoom's fate. It has competition, and more companies are looking into and have implemented their own version of Zoom. So while Zoom enjoyed a veritable monopoly in 2020, those days are over.

ZM has been on a downward trend since late 10/2020 which was still very much ""high COVID season"". I'm the opposite of an expert but I won't be buying stock in it again. I don't think it's bottomed out yet."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Lots of people have been forced to engage with the technology whether they like it or not. The potential to incorporate remote school learning, reduce the need for business trips, virtual conferences instead of reserving conference rooms and pulling people away from their desks, etc etc. Still lots of things to see play out."
03/17/2021,stocks,"There are certainly bubbles as well, and I think the last month has already begun showing that."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You are right. Their is no reason for it. Some companies can get away with the absurd valuations for now because they are excellent businesses in a time of 0% interest rates, like Apple but they aren’t worth twice what they were a year ago they just aren’t. Zoom isn’t worth anything close to 100 billion. We’re still buying peices of these businesses, it’s still about putting down cash now to get more later"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Obligatory, “this is not financial advice”. 

Nope. I’m averaging down on Apple while the herd is “making recovery plays” and the ripples pass through other sectors, because I expect that a significant portion of the people who were in Apple at $140 will return shortly. This is the sort of rebalancing I’m referring to. 

Again, I don’t expect a burst (rapid pulling of money from the market). I expect that the money will simply rotate within the market a bit before settling.

Edit: in the interest of entertainment, I think tech may be sluggish for up to 3 months, but will resume growth."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I do believe that this time is different, not saying that the market will not behave like before"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Just saying that it's maybe a temporary new normal, that can be seen as a bubble but can last longer than ""usual bubbles"""
03/17/2021,stocks,Actially all market indicators point to extreme overvaluation. It is much more than feelings.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Well, not nothing. But not that big of a deal, especially compared to the original projections. It depends on the context of what you compare it to.

Also I'm pretty sure the death toll is around 2.5M"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Right, I mean ZM did triple revenue last year and trades at a lower revenue multiple now than at IPO. Similarly e-commerce gained years worth of expected adoption/growth in one which impacts everything from retail to payment processing. 

Companies faced a massive suppression on margins/earnings due to lockdown mandates which inflates P/E significantly in certain sectors. You either believe that’s short lived, or you believe the company/sector is fundamentally changed forever, which probably guides how you view companies. I think both will be true for various companies and that the market will react in time.

The entire political landscape did shift, which is driving optimism towards increased ESG investment/spend seeing as how that aligns with potential Dem policy spend. 

We certainly have pockets and companies of inflated values, but that doesn’t mean you can just ignore the last year worth of change/information and assume everything will revert."
03/17/2021,stocks,"This time it is different, neh?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"All you did was say nothing but in a long and roundabout way. ""So much can change"". If so much can change, then its equally likely that they crash this year


after all, ""so much can change"" like you say."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm not worried, but I am curious.

I remember as a teen reading about this weird company named Google, trying to be the next Yahoo or Dogpile (yeah, Dogpile), with stock shares going for something like $20. I remember thinking how funny the name was and that it'd never catch on, but maybe I should get my parents to put some money in it.

We didn't.

So while I have the majority of my money in S&P500 and another mutual fund, my ""pocket change"" goes into what could be the next big thing, mostly in mutual funds focused on innovation and emerging markets. Because I'm relatively young, I'm banking on at least one of these ""next big things"" to be the Google I could have had, and I'll be that much more comfortable in 20 years.

Let's just hope society as a whole doesn't collapse. 🙃"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Agreed. Because my work is considered an essential service, we never stopped going in to the office. But we still use Zoom or MS Teams for our meetings to help keep distance. 

In our work, we will continue to use video chat meetings more than we used to, but it will never fully replace in face meetings."
03/17/2021,stocks,Wouldnt someone who was in at $140 on Apple have been burned for almost 10-20% loss? Whats your reasoning behind them returning? Personally if I've been burned for 10%+ on a stock its hard for me to return and buy it again.
03/17/2021,stocks,Oh so you’re saying you can time the market? Wow you must be a billionaire. Well done.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I really don't understand how you arrive at ""equally likely that they crash this year"" from that but you do you."
03/17/2021,stocks,lol your line of reasoning makes no sense
03/17/2021,stocks,"Same with me.  We switched to MS Teams for all meetings and conversations in the office, even though we are in cubicles next to each other.  I have seen almost zero Zoom use personally, although I hear it’s popular with churches and schools.   Gotomeeting is being used to a degree (it sucks though).  MS Teams is by far the dominant app, in the construction space at least.  I also don’t see a huge reduction in use post-pandemic.  Some people have discovered they like working from home and will keep doing it."
03/17/2021,stocks,Because they may have been in it at $140 from a start of $22.
03/17/2021,stocks,"For the same reason anyone enters any stock because they believe it will make them money. High profit report, getting into EV market, new iSomething,... anything can be a trigger for Apple to start rising fast and people wanting to jump on it. Apple is not a volatile stock, it has had a fairly steady climb and it's certainly here to stay. With a good trigger, it's a fairly safe money machine."
03/17/2021,stocks,I had this problem but you lose a lot of good stocks because of that. Just because your timing was bad or some larger player changed their positions is not meaning the company won't recover. You can see that in a lot of stocks.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I’m just a humble millionaire. 

But, in essence, you are saying this time things are different? Something fundamentally changed? Or have I completely missed out on your message?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I had to work from home for two weeks when I had Covid. I absolutely hated it, and it just drove my anxiety through the roof. Was so glad to be able to come back to the office."
03/17/2021,stocks,"So OP seemed to me to be saying ""why are stocks valued so much today when they weren't valued so much a few years ago? How can you explain this?"" and I replied ""why would you expect things to stay the same?"" and then OP challenged me on the fact that things do in fact change and so I listed off some major macro stuff that has changed as why you shouldn't expect the valuations not to change.

So many double negatives there."
03/17/2021,stocks,I’m more of an office guy too.  Although I would probably dig a couple days a week at home - I wouldn’t want to do it all the time.
2021-03-17 15:01:42,stocks,"Premier Oil - Interesting 31st March Merger I'm pretty new to trading, but, I bought some Premier Oil stock (500 @ p19) and I'm going to buy a lot more depending on earnings - 18th of this Month. The reason my stake is so low is that I only began trading in late 2020. The earning will probably be pretty bad, but, I'm still bullish for the reasons below. 

Why I am ***BULLISH:*** 

Premier Oil lost around 70% of its stock price in 2020 and has been increasing in piecemeal ever since. It was announced that Premier Oil and Harbour Energy will be merging, which would create the largest independent oil and gas company by production which will perhaps create $200 million in equity value. 

Also, Premier has said all regulatory conditions had been satisfied and all anti-trust approvals received.

However, sanctions by a Scottish Court on their restructuring is still required, the result will occur on the 19th of March - a day after earnings. This could be really bad OR really good. 

Interestingly, the reverse merger will repay and cancel the bearish debt hanging over Premier, which is amazing. However, this means that shareholders of Premier will end up with only a small 5.45 per cent of the group. 

Linda Cook will also be taking over as CEO which seems like a good thing. 

In **conclusion**: 

I like this stock. I would really appreciate some insight from any passing readers. I understand that Oil is on the decline, but, I feel like this sector will still be okay for a while. As I said, I'm pretty new and I haven't done much DD (or any at all) so I would appreciate some constructive criticism, I'm not sure if the price will rise a lot per share but I think it will rise by at least 20% if all goes to plan."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Oil will always be around whether people like it or not. We've still got at least another good few years whilst the green energy starts to really take over. Green energy has been in a bubble during covid so I think now the market is getting a reality check. Thank you for the small dd, I didn't realize they had earnings call tomorrow. I'll add to my position if need be. Even if it's terrible results the market can sometimes react the opposite way, just like rolls royce did last week and now it's on a rally. Let's see"
03/17/2021,stocks,I actually think oil will go up so this may be a good play. They were not on my radar until I just read this. Going to look into them more now. Thanks for the information.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I bought loads last year at p15 and sold later on at p47. I hadn't looked at it since as I liquidated to cover another debt. I'm shocked is dropped back down again. 

Looks like it might be worth a punt at sub p30 prior to the merger. The reason I hadn't held before is because they don't pay a dividend."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Awesome DD, will definitely be following the progress as I myself do believe that the oil sector will be around for a while. Look at both Chevron and Exxon, they are both recovering and look like they will be around for a while. They are planning a future within green energy but that will take a while."
03/17/2021,stocks,Fuck oil

2021-03-17 14:37:18,stocks,"Let us talk about JinkoSolar #JKS So here we have the worlds largest solar panel producer, growing like a beast, in a future-orientated market. The P/E ratio is at a ridiculously low 15 as of today (the P/S is at 0,5). And it gets barely any attention by the media or analysts. As a matter of fact last year the stock was only covered TWICE by two analysts.  So my question is, what could be the reason why the biggest company in probably one of the most important future markets is being ignored like that?  


Disclosure: I am invested in #JKS"
03/17/2021,stocks,Because it’s got the ‘30% Chinese stock discount’ built in. It’s a strong company with a MASSIVE 59% institutional ownership. Solar is suffering as a sector right now but it’s a solid long term hold.

I have a stock sheet to help me choose about stocks and/or options and up to very recently, it worked really fine but it changed.

This sheet works with GoogleFinance and helps me with the technical analysis.

The point not working anymore is about the price at close the day before. 2 days before (and more) works well, but not the previous day...

>=INDEX(GOOGLEFINANCE(**TICKER**,""close"",WORKDAY(TODAY(),-1)),2,2) doesn't work

but

>=INDEX(GOOGLEFINANCE(**TICKER**,""close"",WORKDAY(TODAY(),-2)),2,2)

For example, I know that the closing price of NFLX 2 days before was 520.25, but not yesterday's one.

03/17/2021,stocks,"I still believe that these short-term drops are great buying opportunities ahead of the market meltup that many analysts expect in the latter portions of this year.

03/17/2021,stocks,"**Stock Market Weather Forecast**

Today is Fed Announcement Day, the day we all gather round and listen to old Mr. Powell tell us about how interest rates aren't raising and the Fed will stay the course on its current policy, and all the little boys and girls in Wall Street make believe that he might have said something else.

Expect big swings up and down throughout the day, with the first swing taking us upward at market open, but the greatest swing coming at 2:00 PM.

I'm predicting today will be a red day with a NASDAQ high of 13,616 and low of 13,395.

The next three days will be rocky, but when it's over, we'll know for sure if the correction is over or just beginning. If we end the week above 13,600, we're golden.

[*View past predictions here.*](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/1Jw6B)

*EDIT: This was a really bad prediction. I'll stick by it for tracking my success rate, but in case anyone wants it, our support line seems to be firmly at 13,272. Resistance is 13,403. Both of these could be broken after 2:00 PM, but should hold until then.*"

Probably gonna invest a bit more with the three paycheck month coming up and just increase a few of the positions and then maybe look at NOW (like the company and use them everyday in my professional life but they are a bit pricy for me) and SPCE, plus one or two pennies and maybe a few others if they fit my fancy.

On the bright side, if I keep looking at the stock market at work, that problem should resolve itself."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Decent day, everything green except for my two penny stock where my total loss/gains are .10 loss for HIPH and a 7k gain for DFLYF.  Up 3.32%.  I am a noob and I started on January 24th by Feb 20 I was losing my ass to a tune of 6.5K.  Got super lucky on DFLYF to get back to even. I have been pretty lucky and have had time to digest some nuances of the market I did not realize.

1. if a stock goes up like a rocket....it usually falls down like a rock.  With DFLYF I was up to 12k at one point.  Got greedy thinking I was going to the moon still exited with 6k
2. learned what a limit order was, which helps me earn a few dimes
3. learned what a stop loss was, saved me a few times
4. learned that profit is profit no matter if it is 6 dollars or 6k
5. Wash sales suck
6. Having money available to buy shit on the fly is a good idea.  10-15 times so far I have ended the day green because of a quick 2k buy and a quick turnaround sell for 2150.  Yeah, I have missed some larger gains but I still was green at the end of the day.
7. Meme stocks can earn you a pissload in a second, and break you in a second.  Gamestop has made me a pretty penny and lost me a pretty penny.  That shit is like heroin....try it once and GTFO.
8. Diamond Hands are complete bullshit on a lot of stocks.  Thank you rocket mortgage. (i will be crying Friday when it hits 100)
9. DD is a pain the ass and time-consuming as Fuck.  It takes a skilled human to parse through all the info, ADHD sucks for that.
10. I am learning about margin trading and I think I might avoid that for a while.

51 days into trading  I am up 12.5%.  I know this is not easy but after a shakey start, I will take what I can.

It's sitting at 34.50 right now which is pretty overvalued tbh and probably off the back of the airline hype, but if it sells off I think it's worth a look."

​

I was wondering if someone can help me please with an Ingredion stock analysis from the Morningstar premium account. 

​

I am particularly interested in 3 things: 

​

1) how is Ingredion performing 

2) how good is a premium service like Morningstar performing in analysis

3) what are your opinions about Morningstar and Ingredion 

​

03/17/2021,stocks,"I'll post it here as well...

Anyone looking at what's happening with Volkswagen? CEO gave a Elon Musk Style presentation on Monday at their ""Power Day"", the more liquid preference share VOW3 went up but the thinly traded ordinary shares VOW went through the roof and decoupled from the preference shares (they normally trade very close to each other).

The ordinary has 10% short interest according to IHS markit vs less than 8% float... 53% porsche, 20% state of lower saxony, 17% Qatar and read on bbg that the Porsche family controls another 2.3% via a trust in Austria...

The run up on the ordinary seems to have been caused by the fact that US retails are buying the american ADR VWAGY which is somehow based on the ordinary not on the pref. (yesterday volumes on the ADR were 11.3x the 3M average vs only 2.6x for the pref)

looks like the shorts on the ordinary are getting squeezed, anyone else following the situation? 
here article from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/vw-ceo-s-embrace-of-the-elon-musk-s-playbook-is-paying-dividends)

03/17/2021,stocks,"I am new to options and going slow. Everything I have risked is well within my risk tolerance. I also don't mind closing out trades to make a .0000001 gain because making the trade in practice makes more sense to me. Can someone(s) check my strategy/give advice? This trade isn't about fundamentals :) I am trying to learn with a volatile stock with minimal risk. 

I have a CSP for AMC 3/19 11.50. I bought at .975. The ask is .41 right now. My assumptions are AMC will drop further and may likely go below 11.50 by Friday. I want the stock but I think I can get it lower than 11.50 if my assumptions are correct. 

Based on my assumptions, should I sell to close with a net \~$50 gain from the trade? And write another CSP at 8 or 9? I do expect the option cost to change at open as the stock drops (and this will effect my buy to close)."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I think so many people on here were like ""oh, hydrogen sounds cool, I'll buy some of that"" and never bothered to research anything else.

Of all the different green technologies, hydrogen has the steepest path to success. So many extremely difficult and expensive barriers to break through. Also, they are not even a green technology since 90% of the world's hydrogen comes from natural gas. Blows my mind how many people don't know that."

03/17/2021,stocks,The difference between this morning and rn are zero for an investor tho

There was no way AMZN purchased that amount since they only sold 25,000 forklifts spread out over 10 customers per their investor presentation.   Lovely booking sales and giving rewards - I am waiting to see when Walmart gets their warrants executed."

03/17/2021,stocks,Happens to me all the time
03/17/2021,stocks,Agreed but I don't think the market is oversold yet. It needs to finish the correction so it can move higher confidently
03/17/2021,stocks,It is irrational indeed. Being in for the long term makes short term volatility less problematic. But...yikes.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Isn't it the opposite? The rate keeps increasing because nobody wants to buy the bonds? Then that increases interest rates, which spikes inflation worries, which is why nobody wants to buy bonds, which causes bond rates to increase to attract buyers and thus we can't get out of this cycle?"

03/17/2021,stocks,"long haul stock, period.

but I understand the frustration, out of all the meme stocks (besides tesla), this one should not be behaving the way it has been with expansion into a diverse array of sectors with contracts (government, automotive, materials (3m), airline (Airbus), etc.). they are planting obvious seeds into these giant companies to prove their disruptive software, and the company heavily prioritizes the company mission over profits, which is huge for long term (sounds familiar? - tesla). I understand the valuation is high, but look at snowflake.

I would not worry about this in the short term, but it is infuriating.

Cutting the keystone pipeline? The same amount of oil will still need to be transported but now it’s being done by inefficient trucks that emit C02 and cost more.

Limiting federal lease? Lease royalty and availability to drill goes up, increasing overall lease operating expense."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I agree, but the human mind can't help but reconsider their choice when facing obstacles. 

E.g, have a big fight with your girlfriend and reconsider the relationship. Have a shitty first week at your new job and reconsider if it's the right one.

Of all the green tech, hydrogen has the most difficult path to success. It's difficult and expensive to store and move. Also, when was the last time you saw a hydrogen station on the side of the road? All that premium gas station real estate is already taken, and  the companies that own those gas stations are all focused on how to add electric charging options to their sites. Hydrogen isn't anywhere on their radar.

Two... hydrogen isn't even a green technology. 90% of the worlds hydrogen comes from natural gas. I'm amazed at how many people don't know this."

Choppy Tuesday and Wednesday and green Wednesday afternoon-Friday was too predictable. I'm selling the rest of BAC around 1, probably 12 to be safe.

That explains the reason it tanked because most of those shell companies got completely and thoroughly socked when the Nasdaq sold off.

There doesn't need to be any conspiracy here about it being shorted either, when the Nasdaq gets beaten up, you'll see more speculative type stuff, even if it's a thing that will be great for the world, get an even worse beating than the big names.

03/17/2021,stocks,"> Help us jpow

jpow is the reason stuff is down. everyone expects good overall but bad for the market news from him.

people think he's going to say unemployment is falling faster than expected and that he expects a full economic quicker than expected and release better projections than prior reports. while in theory this is a good thing, it's going to increase the odds of interest rates rising sooner  rather than expected (maybe 2023 rather than 2024) and THAT is going to freak some people out.

there's also the fact that the SLR ratio relaxing from when things crashed last year was a 1 year thing that expires in a couple weeks, and the expectation is that jpow isn't going to announce an extension today (and will ultimately just let it expire)

tl;dr, jpow is more likely to make the afternoon worse than the morning."

The idea is great, but integrating with POS systems are a nightmare. They're all old and rubbish, and you need that integration to drive the mobile app, plus it has fountains of data. Fundamentally I think the real players in this space are Square and iZettle (bought by paypal). They are building modern POS systems that have mobile ordering functionality, and modern apis for anyone to connect. 

Tough to tell how these companies will do without a big change in tech, but it's a long time coming."

I will have lost $2,000 -- but at tax time, I will have to pay another $2,250 in taxes, because I'll be taxed 15% on those gains, ignoring the losses."

03/17/2021,stocks,Did you pay attention to the stock you're talking about? DIS is not up but down right now
03/17/2021,stocks,It's probably the official date confirmation that blew it up
03/17/2021,stocks,For short term APPS have not failed me.
03/17/2021,stocks,"> ASLE - Not red today, but I think that's a good sign. It's way down from it's 52 week high, but has been slowly creeping up over the past few days.
> 
> They refurbish and sell used airline parts (mostly engines) to the airline companies. I think they are a really good recovery play because even when the airlines start making money again, there will be a big focus on cost savings and reducing debt. ASLE is the only real player in the ""used"" parts sector."
03/17/2021,stocks,In English please.
03/17/2021,stocks,">	Can anybody convince me why I should hold onto ICLN? 

Because this country isn’t reliant on clean energy and there’s no expectation of clean energy stocks to be profitable until it is. Look outside your window and count the number of electric cars you see. I don’t understand how people were thinking ICLN was going to be going 300% in 3 months. 


That’s the thing with getting in on the ground floor, it’s the floor for a reason. There are a bunch of people that dumped Apple when Windows 95 came out because it was waving big red dicks at them going from $.40 to $.20."
03/17/2021,stocks,Lol I see this everyday. I'm not holding but I almost feel bad for everyone else. Dump it if you think green energy isn't the future.
03/17/2021,stocks,I sold it a while ago. It didn't do anything under Obama either. It seems like it rose in anticipation of the Democrats taking office. Turns out the Dems seem to be better for oil and war related stocks.
03/17/2021,stocks,I'd wait for Jpow to tank the market
03/17/2021,stocks,Don't buy it until they significantly reduce the amount of PLUG in the portfolio. Needs to be 4% or less in my opinion. Anything more than that is not a good sign.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm invested in it and i admit i keep regretting it lol


I think once the ""correction"" is truly over and we go back to a real bull market, ICLN will do just fine.... but sometimes i question my choice of not having sold it at the beginning of the correction lol"
03/17/2021,stocks,"They're heavily dependent on PLUG. When PLUG was going ham it was great. Today, PLUG is getting crushed for restating their financials so ICLN is hurting. I think clean energy still has good long term growth. If PLUG recovers or they shuffle their position in PLUG, the share price will improve."
03/17/2021,stocks,Are we still expecting a March 29 release??? I haven’t been able to find any recent news other than the filing and speculation.

03/17/2021,stocks,"I say this as someone with almost 5% of my stock portfolio in PLTR, that the stock may trade fairly flat for a long time and I personally don’t think people should be committing large amounts of their portfolio to it yet."
03/17/2021,stocks,Yes that's why the ceo dumped all his stock

03/17/2021,stocks,Stick to mutual funds if you want to make money. Start day trading if you want to lose it. Pretty simple really
03/17/2021,stocks,BABA literally has 30 times the revenue with once again 30x the profit margins.
03/17/2021,stocks,"You'll make money just because of the dividend.

03/17/2021,stocks,Stop loss maybe? Sell part of it I dunno I’m not an advisor. I broke even on PayPal when I coulda made a couple hundred a month ago when it started dropping. No one has a crystal ball.

Sell and take profits"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes, and yes. Don't paper hand during a routine correction period. Just be patient."
03/17/2021,stocks,Yes.
03/17/2021,stocks,Nah that was BS
03/17/2021,stocks,Who said it was delayed?
03/17/2021,stocks,Not every dip is a coordinated attack... WSB got to you with that bullshit huh?
03/17/2021,stocks,This may surprise you but people are allowed to sell on the market...
03/17/2021,stocks,The stock market frequently dips around 10:30. It's not a coordinated attack
03/17/2021,stocks,Happens just about everyday with most stocks from what I’ve seen.

03/17/2021,stocks,I haven't done a full DD on POSH specifically but everyone prefers etsy and pinterest over poshmark. I see some analysts rating posh a buy so may be worth looking into.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Try applying for level 2 again. My experience is that they will only bump you up 1 level at a time. Say you are at level 0 (no options allowed) and apply to get level 3, they will only get you to level 1. You apply again they lift you to level 2. They don't jump you through multiple levels in one approval it seems."
03/17/2021,stocks,Same thing Happened to me about two months ago. Waited like a week and then reapplied and said i had more trading experience and the riskiest/most aggressive trading profile. Got approved in two days.

They're buying houses cheap, renovating them, and selling them much more expensive on their own platform."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Never happening because most retail investors actively trading lose money in a normal market, which means the big players usually profit off. I don't see them lobbying.

Besides, more people in the market = more gains. Everyone benefits investing in the market long term."
03/17/2021,stocks,That would be a strange idea. I think retail investors is only a positive thing for the economy and even hedge funds 99% of the time.
03/17/2021,stocks,I have a friend who has been trading it a bit. I'm not convinced it's a real company lmao.
03/17/2021,stocks,I'll be adding 25 shares to my portfolio today. Thanks for sharing.

2. How are you down 10% still? NASDAQ has mostly recovered at this point"
03/17/2021,stocks,Paper hands
03/17/2021,stocks,"Selling is the smart thing to do. Most portfolio managers see a 5% loss as a sign they need to change their strategy or adjust their portfolio. A 10% loss is massive. Losing 10% of your money before the market even opens is BAD. Think of your risk tolerance. If you need this money then losing 10% of it is intolerable—think of all you can do with that money, think about what you’ll need in an emergency, think about long term savings."

03/17/2021,stocks,They released a Summary of Economic Projections @ 2pm and the data confirmed what he has been saying all along. Before investors were weary. Now it is more confirmed.  No interest rate spikes until and hyper inflation is not an immediate concern.
03/17/2021,stocks,Well said
03/17/2021,stocks,A lot of people on this sub almost seem to think you are only allowed to buy on red days

03/17/2021,stocks,I sold one stock because I was scared of the reaction tbh...and my bet lost. Guess I'm waiting for the next dip if it happens..
03/17/2021,stocks,The market dropped in anticipation of the press conference. It wouldn't really make sense to keep dropping after Powell said exactly what he was expected to when the market already sold off beforehand
03/17/2021,stocks,"Thought I'd learned my lesson, as usually I watch prices continue to drop after buying. Oh well, I'm sure we'll revisit some of these prices again."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Just like the last green shift in 2008. 

Green energy may be the future, but I can be a quick way to destroy capital if a 2008 repeat happens"
03/17/2021,stocks,"People with huge sums of money realise they can get a 2.5% return on their money from bonds which is risk free. This means they don’t need to take a risk in the market any longer and thus move their money from equities and into bonds. This means that lots of selling occurs driving prices down.

EDIT: Appears I am wrong please see comments below"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Treasury bonds are where you give your money to the government, and the government gives you your money back in X number of years with Y% interest. The changes in these yields are what is most likely causing this market turbulence, which is imo asinine because it is (or should be) very disconnected from stable companies doing their own thing and is creating market volatility which puts everyone on edge."
03/17/2021,stocks,"My high was almost too high for the low.

I'm always wrong on Powell day."
03/17/2021,stocks,Just wear the brown pants. You'll be fine.
03/17/2021,stocks,Same. I even have some oil and that took a shit yesterday. With jpow talking today I we are in for the worst
03/17/2021,stocks,Yes
03/17/2021,stocks,Still only down 7.6% the last month compared to my ZG position down 26.3% the last month
03/17/2021,stocks,You’ve got a point. I think Imma buy 50% now and 50% after the speech.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I cant find when hes speeking, anyone got a link?"
03/17/2021,stocks,When does he speak?
03/17/2021,stocks,"TXN

I'd likely keep it simple and target stuff in the Nasdaq-100 though, if I were to be honest. Watching the behavior of ARKK, if we are going to see rates continue higher over the year, it's game, set, match, for the fun stuff."
03/17/2021,stocks,I'm 50 in so today hurts.  But I think I've made more than I lost today solely on the dividends over the years.

03/17/2021,stocks,"everyone on this forum expected him to say exactly what he said, and last time it tanked the market. Markets are weird."

03/17/2021,stocks,But did they make it REALLY clear
03/17/2021,stocks,They did. People continue to not believe them.
03/17/2021,stocks,They did. That’s why I’m personally very confused. This isn’t new info.

03/17/2021,stocks,I guess if I plan to hold long term I shouldn’t worry then huh?
03/17/2021,stocks,"This is why I like lists. When I'm down, and I see everything else is down, it makes the sting a bit more tolerable."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It does help. I made a watch list that just has a bunch of different sector ETFs in it I call ""market health"". I check it from time to ti.e to see if it's everyone or just me.

TPL is the only thing keeping today from being bleeding day for me. I still don't even have a full share but it's pulling hard for me. 4.81% today."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Agreed, it's better to know other people are getting hammered, as I am today lol"
03/17/2021,stocks,The market has been absurdly bullish post COVID. I think that this correction was imminent at some point. 😶
03/17/2021,stocks,Down with reality
03/17/2021,stocks,Why does it make perfect sense for either to drop after the pandemic? Tech they’re in hasn’t really made a dent in regard to the current situation. This is long shot stuff. Especially ARKG.
03/17/2021,stocks,Care to share your thoughts on it? I'm curious.
03/17/2021,stocks,"My man I've been averaging down throughout March 😄 

What's up with the Fed?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Same here. Always gotta keep in mind that when you try to time the market, you are competing against other market timers, and its very difficult to beat the pros and the bots. For retail like us its best to buy and hold for years."

03/17/2021,stocks,Sq is the more speculative play of the 2
03/17/2021,stocks,"PYPL is the better play. Before all of the bond yield craziness, PYPL was touching $310. They have more going for them in my opinion with venmo and their investments in taking crypto, adding to future profits. I think we've hit the floor with PYPL at $240 range. Once the dust settles with the market volatility and stocks start acting on their own again, I expect PYPL to get back into the $280 range pretty quickly."
03/17/2021,stocks,Good
03/17/2021,stocks,That or Bulls on Parade ;)
03/17/2021,stocks,Yeah.  It’s just so strange that this one is so far off.  I didn’t know if maybe there’s shenanigans because it’s a company that’s involved with the Chinese government and contracts.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Although Intel is not just a CPU though, they’re well diversified company. Also based from AMD, Intel is still the leader.

“Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies.

Also, Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs.”

From AMD’s Form 10-K Dec 2020

Intel still have a very large capital and cashflow than AMD to stay in the game, not just in CPUs, but in Ai generally."

It affects the market for various secondary reasons (e.g. Companies rely on people buying their corporate bonds; if the yields on bonds look bad, so do the yields on growth stocks, etc)."

03/17/2021,stocks,Yes definitely avoiding the highly speculative companies.
03/17/2021,stocks,You probably have. And this is just a temporary dip. ABBV always recovers nicely. It's too attractive of a dividend stock to sell off too long. I have a medium-sized position in this myself and am not worried at all. I'd love to add more shares at a discounted price. Such a great dividend.

They saw massive, unprecedented growth in 2020, and investors are going to be watching their earnings report with the expectation that that growth will continue as the nation reopens.

I would bet on that growth not continuing. These companies all have new competitors, decreased interest, and the loss of a motivation to continue using their products. 

They'll probably all do better than they did in 2019, don't get me wrong -- but they'll also probably drop from their ATH over the next 12 months."

03/17/2021,stocks,"What are your thoughts on how the whole GME-scenario is going to end?

I can see three ways: 

For one, the squeeze somehow does happen. Price goes close to a thousand or beyond that, hard crash, over. 

Number two, same thing, but no squeeze. Crash from this current level of around 200 back to the low two-digits, and over. 

Or, in my opinion most likely, this continues to yoyo up and down while people are unsure. The level gradually goes lower and lower until we’re back to reasonable prices (maybe $50 to $60 ?)

What do you think?"

03/17/2021,stocks,"Question about naked shorting, a possible stock recall and Cede:

I'll try to be as brief as possible. It seems like the hedge funds simply keep shorting GME over and over again to try to cover, thereby digging themselves into a deeper hole (using a credit card to pay off another credit card). This normally would end in disaster once your credit runs out. But – will their credit ever run out? Since it seems they can short the same stocks – wether naked or real – as many times as they want, can they just keep doing that indefinitely if they want?

Unless GME does a stock recall, wherein they're supposedly screwed, right? But I've been thinking: how do us retail investors know that we're holding 'real' shares? What if shares we bought are counterfeit? And on top of that there's Cede and Co, who actually own the stocks while we just 'license' them, so couldn't they just decide that the hedge funds have the real stocks while us suckers actually have the fake ones and screw us over that way?"

03/17/2021,stocks,You guys ever think this has nothing to do with the bond market rather everything to do with GME. It caused funds to lose literally billions of dollars. Where do they find that money? From existing positions in the market. That's why everything has been red for so long. Blame GME.

03/17/2021,stocks,There's my Warhammer friend!
03/17/2021,stocks,All of wallstreet apparently
03/17/2021,stocks,When is he speaking?
03/17/2021,stocks,any news？
03/17/2021,stocks,heavily considering buying the dip. IMO it was an overreaction to some accounting issues. CEO still committed to his numbers and profitability. I think we are going to see a swing
03/17/2021,stocks,"Considering the Chad share buy of their CEO, I don't think a dip back to 9 is gonna happen. Idk tho."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Bear. Call options are too expensive and retail investor morale is low, so no one is buying em and therefore there will be no gamma squeeze. I do think a lot of people are waiting to see what might happen at ER, but I suspect it won't be enough to get gamma'd since no one can really afford call options right now."
03/17/2021,stocks,I kept a few after selling off the majority a few weeks ago. Someone said it perfectly that its a bad movie you are just dying to see the ending to.
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's been pretty stagnant for a while, bad signs for a hype stock since it's boring. Low volume overall aswell. The one thing I think could pump it a bit are the stimulus checks, but not that much probably. I think it's gonna decline slowly but steadily in the coming days"
03/17/2021,stocks,"""The biggest drawback to using beta to make an investment decision is that beta is a historical measure of a stock's volatility. It can show you the pattern so far but it can't tell you what's going to happen in the future."" - Investopedia.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but I don't see why this would be the next big thing if beta is a result of historical numbers (which appear to be numbers of a couple of years, with a monthly update?). Eager to learn more about this, so if anybody could explain this better to me?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Does -8.3 BETA mean that it moves 8.3 times as fast as the general stock market, in opposite direction?"
03/17/2021,stocks,Who invited the good news bear. Someone better get you some honey!
03/17/2021,stocks,"Squeeze will never happen, the whole thing is predicated that everyone is lying about numbers, a claim with no evidence and also unfalsifiable = a claim that belongs to trash. 

With that being said, what you’re seeing here is simple bubble or mania buying. Market makers buying slightly cheap and selling to retail traders willing to pay overpriced amount. It might go up a bit here and there but nothing big since whoever wanted to buy in already has. but it’ll definitely come down eventually. There’s no predicting when it’ll go down since usually it’s triggered by something causing a panic, like a sell of or just a bunch of sell orders happening at the same time.  After that yea it’ll probably settle at around $50 which is overpriced still but with new management and all is justifiable. It’ll probably slow bleed $30 eventually"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I’m betting on a big rise before it comes down. There’s too much hype & too many pending catalysts that could cause the bubble to pop up, before rapidly descending. Potential to unload positions on way up for some nice profit."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It’s worth noting that before all the coverage of a possible short squeeze, GME had a target price of $125-$150"
03/17/2021,stocks,"It’s a casino man, it can fly again but get just as easily swatted down lower than your entry point in a matter of seconds"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Honestly in my thought if it really is smaller hedge fund using the stock to go after larger hedge funds which is what I have read then this weeks activity would make sense to me. 

If I were managing one of those hedge funds I would want to let it kind of do it’s thing Monday, but maintain some level of stability which we saw. 

Establish SSR for Wednesday which happened  yesterday when we saw it dip to 170s. Then bring it back up to a level where retail investors feel comfortable investing stimulus checks with it ending above 200. 

This in my opinion would give a great set up for Wednesday run up, followed by a dip Thursday to once again establish SSR for Friday where then it would be run up to bring the naked calls ITM forcing them to be covered and increasing the price further. 

But that’s just my thoughts on what I would do. I’m looking at taking some profits today in full disclosure and reinvesting if I see it dip again tomorrow. I’m also an idiot just an FYI"
03/17/2021,stocks,I think it has another run but there will be a better entry point later in the day. At least I hope so...
03/17/2021,stocks,"Stimulus checks are hitting this week (I woke up and mine was direct deposited in my account this morning). So un-ironically I think that will give it some more rocket fuel, because dumb apes. The crater is approaching though.... (at which point I'll probably by 1000 shares!)."
03/17/2021,stocks,this sorta shit is why people were talking about requesting their physical certificates
03/17/2021,stocks,"Even if it goes down to 50, they would have made so much money off the short. They know it's going to go down eventually, that's why they keep shorting. 

The second paragraph is just.....tin foil hat hour if im  being polite lol"
03/17/2021,stocks,I agree with you 100%. I know these hedge funds have billions and connections to the highest levels of government. Assuming there is even any squeeze left ...they certainly aren’t gonna pay out more than $483 a share since they blocked all buying at that point. I know the GME cult is gonna say “ThEy HaVe To RePlAcE tHe ShArEs Or Go To Jail”....is that even true? I doubt any financial people going to jail for naked shorting GameStop.
03/17/2021,stocks,"all depends on your risk tolerance and your expectations. Long term investments are the safest place to put the money. there are some extremely stable companies out there. Short term plays can be highly lucrative or totally bust you.

03/17/2021,stocks,"I have been saying this for a month. If you run the discounted cash flow analysis, as Wallstreet claimed to be the big issue with growth stocks, this tiny rise in rates is a blip.  There is no doubt in my mind it was an excuse to trade into value/cyclical and run those up at the same time beating growth down for reentry.  These value/cyclical trades are mostly BS!  Take a look at Live Nation for example. Being touted like crazy, it is now above its prepandemic high and then some. Shit earnings, was declining prior to the pandemic as 1 and 4th quarters have always sucked for this stock. Cuban is a big holder and has been pumping this turd...nothing against Cubes. There are some great value/cyclical stocks, but most of them are so overvalued it is redonkulous!"
03/17/2021,stocks,Billions is peanuts here
03/17/2021,stocks,"Who is the bad guy in that scenario, GME or a corrupt system?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I do think that, yes."
03/17/2021,stocks,I made 5% on LMND in 4 hours today (I tend to day trade my stocks)
03/17/2021,stocks,GME and AMC's beta is negative. They're inversely correlated with the overall market
03/17/2021,stocks,didn't they go out of business years ago?
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's absolutely a possibility, especially considering how many calls were bought in the second half of the week last week. Whether or not it will actually run up and gamma squeeze to the moon is unknown; we saw how much resistance there was to break 300 last week with an absolute assload of calls at that strike.

Otherwise the only compelling catalyst is the day that Cohen speaks about his position in the company and plans for the future, which could likely come with the ER. Only reason I'd be looking forward to the ER though, since it's safe to say none of us invested money in GME for it's astounding fundamentals."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Quadruple witching day, Options, Ryan Cohen hinting at becoming CEO (not fixed to 19th though), Earnings on 23rd (calling shares back after?splitting them?), New DTCC rule might kick in on 19th too."

03/17/2021,stocks,"It will 100% not squeeze on the 19th, call option volume is too low and at too disperant of intervals. 23rd is ER, even with good news, call option buying volume is too low and will likely remain too low."

03/17/2021,stocks,"there will be no more gamma squeeze. the open interest is way lower this week as opposed to last week. If anything, there will be a short squeeze following some

03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm a newbie, but from my understanding there is an inverted correlation like you say. I'm not sure it is 8.3 times as fast, but - 8 is stronger than for - 2 for example. I'm hoping someone with knowledge and experience can shine a light on it."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I didn't say I believed that was going to happen – I was just asking about possibilities.

I mean, so much other crazy stuff has happened with this so far, who knows, right?"
03/17/2021,stocks,That was my concern.
03/17/2021,stocks,"The safest volatile stocks I’ve found so far are LMND & FLGT, but you would need about $1k if you want to make good money...
FLGT had a regular bounce from $90-$110, today it started at $107 and has already gone above $121 (since it was above $100 premarket, I thought it was a down day and didn’t jump in but later found out they just signed a gov’t contract)
LMND was my play today, I bought 20 shares @ $98 and just sold them @ $103.50 for a $107 payday

I would love to find other stocks with reliable volatility,  I enjoy making a regular payday, even thought it’s not high dollar (my dad’s friend regularly has $5k paydays, but he is also playing with much more bank than me)"
03/17/2021,stocks,"also, learning the stock market is a good thing. Don't let me dissuade you. Why not start smaller? Dare i say the much hated Robinhood might be a good place to start. I think they have a minimum of 100 bucks to open an account. buying stocks with robinhood is extremely easy. Open to other opinions about which house to use from the group here. Mess around with the 100 bucks to get the hang of it. Trading stocks can be an emotional rollercoaster. 

I suggest you learn about fractional stocks and cash violations. Learn about margin accounts. I dont suggest you open a margin account when just starting out but cash violations and margin accounts kinda go hand in hand. Learning about cash vol will lead you to learning about margin anyway."
03/17/2021,stocks,Both - SEC shouldn't allow something to be shorting like this. Likewise GME should issue more shares.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah Ive been confused about that. Looking at GME graphed agianst the SPY, it seems like the biggest inverse was during GMEs initial rally then crash. Its behaved pretty normally since. How can we be sure that lingering beta values arent a result of that spike and crash; and not due to the intrinsic nature of GME? Ive been trying to find out how Yahoo and Bloomberg came across these numbers, as Im not certain beta is satistically significant at this point."
03/17/2021,stocks,I feel a resurgence.
03/17/2021,stocks,Which we keep saying and yet the damn thing is still 200 something
03/17/2021,stocks,Yeah I ended up selling. If it shoots up again and the MOASS does end up happening I'll regret it like but tbh a lot of the GME stuff just seems a bit too desperate and cult-y for me to wanna gamble it
03/17/2021,stocks,OOOOHHHH Oooooh OOOOOHHHH

03/17/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/17/2021,stocks,"No short squeeze either though since short interest is likely 30%, or if there is high short interest, the due dates for those are way off in the distance."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You don't need any experience to understand what beta is. However, beta means NOTHING to a meme stock like GME. Even for regular stocks,  beta can only be useful if you consider large time windows. For day trading it has very little meaning."
03/17/2021,stocks,"True - then again, AMC's earning sucked and they were shit pre-Covid, yet the rally continues! Over $13 this morning."
03/17/2021,stocks,What platform is someone like you using? With mine fees would eat up that profit and not make it worth the risk.
03/17/2021,stocks,What a poor take. You should never be allowed to short more than the total available shares. Period.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I took 2 roller coaster rides on the GME rocket...
I got in @ $161 and rode to $217 then jumped back in @ $280 and hopped off @ $327 just before the drop (lucky me)
I decided the paydays were decent, but the unreliable volatility was going to give me an ulcer and I didn’t need the potential gains costing me pain or medical bills."
03/17/2021,stocks,It's hard to know with the volatility.
03/17/2021,stocks,"30% is still pretty high and is more than enough for a short-squeeze if, and it is a big if, GameStop recalls all its shares."
03/17/2021,stocks,Thanks for responding! Noted 👍
03/17/2021,stocks,"Wow...fees? Still?  I use a few different platforms (I’m a sucker for bonuses for opening accounts)
Stash charges a monthly fee (I pay $1/month) but they offered me $30 when I opened my account and added $5... a week after adding the money, I didn’t see the extra $ so I sent them a message and they added $50 to my account, so I got $50 for $5 ...
Then I have Merrill Edge which I’ve had since 2014, but sometime between 2017 when I sold my AAPL and this February when I got back into trading, they eliminated their old $7 fee... so now I can trade all day... I still have some 1 penny federal fee per order (not per share) but that is very negligible...
Finally, I recently opened up a Schwab account....another bonus giver, they gave me $100 (apparently it can take a month, still waiting because I just opened it a week ago)... no fees, no minimum but the platform isn’t as user friendly as Merrill (at least not on my iPad) ...
If you want to open an account with either of the two bonus companies, here are links...
I guess the one you do (unless like me you do both) it matters how much you invest... in order to get the bonus in Schwab, you need to deposit $1,000 or more, whereas Stash only requires $5 investment.

03/17/2021,stocks,"I agree with you, that's my first point. SEC shouldn't allow more than total available shares to be shorted. But they also must step in and force GME to issue more shares when nearing 100%."
03/17/2021,stocks,I got in early at 20 and got out before it crashed the first time....ofc it then spiked to it's record high a day later lol. I didn't want to stress out trying to get back in
03/17/2021,stocks,True but hasn't reddit been talking about this for months now? Surely all the hedgefunds shorting gamestop have GTFO by now and the whole thing is just being held up by the last gasp of hype and stragglers like me who bought in too late
03/17/2021,stocks,"What? no. 30% is average and that short interest has to be new shorts, folks agreeing to sell in the 100s. No way itll be enough for a squeeze. I mean it may make the stock go up some but its not consolidated enough to squeeze it."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Ahhh I see, the problem seems to be that I'm Canadian lol.

Appreciate the detailed response, hopefully someone else can find use of these great apps."
03/17/2021,stocks,I just ditched schwab because they dont have access to IPOs. in the middle of a transfer to fid
03/17/2021,stocks,How would GME benefit from that? It’s not their fault that a firm decided to naked short them into oblivion. SEC forcing them to issue more shares would set a bad precedent considering most consider the SEC is already in bed with various fund managers
03/17/2021,stocks,"... and then the shorts short those shares too. That solves literally nothing while massively dicking over the company and existing shareholders. Shorting could also then be used specifically as a tool to arbitrarily force companies to issue more shares, which has its own set of manipative problems"
03/17/2021,stocks,"If you're suggesting to have gme issue shares, that's up to the executive board cause they're the ones who decide what to do with the stock. I'm betting they're going to recall the shares. Check Ryan Cohen's cryptic tweets; I believe he has a plan on the 4th q earnings call"
03/17/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/17/2021,stocks,"A recall of all shares by GameStop’s management would create a similar kind of scenario to Volkswagen when Porsche bought the vast majority of the shares in that company in the lead-up to 2008, and VW ended up squeezing on just 12% short interest. So 30% is more than enough."
03/17/2021,stocks,">30% is average

LOL. In what universe??????"
03/17/2021,stocks,What about WealthSimple? No fees for me here in Canadia
03/17/2021,stocks,"I’ll likely keep them a little while because Merrill wouldn’t let me buy ARK when I wanted to, but Schwab did so if nothing else, I can keep it for the things Merrill won’t do"
03/17/2021,stocks,Not every hedge fund wants GameStop to go out of business. They got money to make on other stocks too.
03/17/2021,stocks,"No way they will do that though, if anything they'll distribute more shares to fundraise"
03/17/2021,stocks,That’s why I said it’s a pretty big ‘if’. Lol
2021-03-17 13:17:30,stocks,"Need help understanding selling CC's - sounds too good to be true. So I've been looking into selling covered calls, and my understanding of it makes it sounds extremely profitable for such a low risk that I think there must be some kind of fundamental mistake in my understanding, because when something sounds too good to be true, it normally is. I've known about selling CC's for a while, but I saw in a thread on WSB that someone sold just 2 11/19 800C's on GME for $20,000, and this piqued my interest as I didn't realise it could be this profitable. Of course, GME is a very volatile stock so options contracts will have a larger premium, and this comes with the downside of you needing to hold a volatile stock until November. But when I run the numbers on my head on a more stable stock, it still seems sounds like by far the best investment strategy, and it makes me wonder why everyone isn't doing it.

Say for example, you buy 100 apple shares for $125, for a total investment of $12,500. According to yahoo finance, right now a 3/26 $130C goes for 0.94, x100 that's $94. Obviously the stock has a reasonably high chance of hitting that price, but even if it does you're still keeping the premium plus $500 gains from the stock moving up $5, so you wouldn't be too unhappy. But let's say it does hit the strike price, you can just sell your stock, buy back in at the new higher price, and repeat your strategy. It seems to me like you could be making at least $70 a week in premiums off just a $12,500 investment, x52 weeks a year thats $3640, more than a 25% annual ROI with the only downside being that you have to hold 100 apple stock, which could potentially fall, or potentially rise more than 25%. Is this really how it works? Is there something I'm not considering?"

03/17/2021,stocks,"You pretty much summed it up. CCs are absolutely great to generate a small and steady income stream, simply by holding a stock. They‘re like a take profit that pays you, in a way. If you buy the stock with a set-in-stone intention of selling it at a certain price, CCs are free money. 

One small error in your post is that the risk isn’t the stock rising 25%, it’s rising above your strike, causing you to miss out. For example, if your strike sits at 120 and it goes to 125, you‘ll spend quite some time „making up“ your lost profits. 

I think the reasons you don’t see a ton of retail traders doing it are fear of missing a big jump, and fear of options in general. You also have to remember that you’re still carrying the full risk of the stock losing a lot of value, while giving up the chance of it gaining a lot of value (for you)."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Covered calls cap your gains while still exposing you to the same downside risk. The premium is also dependent on how volatile the stock price is, if the stock is **too** stable, then the premium is also going to be really low. Using your AAPL example, let's say you buy 100 shares for $125 and sell a 3/26 130C for $0.94:

1. If the price of AAPL shoots up to $150 at expiration, you're forced to sell at $130, giving up an additional $20/share = $2000.

2. If the price of AAPL drops to $105, you keep the $94 premium, but you lose $20/share = $2000. The +$94 is going to seem like nothing next to the -$2000.

3. Realistically, you're looking at a 10-20% return/year selling options, which sounds pretty nice but you also have to actively manage it. Some ETFs can return that much or more, and all you have to do is buy and hold and check it once a month.

4. It doesn't really give you much protection if the market goes against you, just a band-aid at most. While there's stories of people who turned a losing position into profit by selling CC's, it also ties up a lot of capital in a losing position rather than cutting losses and deploying elsewhere for potentially bigger gains in a shorter amount of time.

CC's work best in a sideways market or one that's slowly going up at a predictable rate, but not so well when things are volatile or dropping."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It’s not free money because the stock can drop also. The 25% you calculated is if the stock never goes down. 

Also, it’s possible that at a certain point, you won’t be able to afford the shares anymore. What if you can afford 100 shares at first, but then the stock shoots up a lot past the strike price, and when it comes time to buy back after getting assigned you can only afford 94 shares?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"The strategy you're referring to sounds a lot like wheel strategy. I don't personally use it, but I use a simple CC strategy that works for my investment style. I have a couple hundred shares of stocks that I have a target sell price for, and will hold in the event they go down so I have no reason not to do CCs. Say my target sell price is $65, I then sell $64 covered calls and collect $100 premium. If they don't assign i keep my $100 and still collect any dividends. If they do assign, I was planning on selling at $65 anyways so it makes no difference to me."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Because you cap your potential upside, but your downside is still the same. Most of the time if you invest in a few stocks. Some will be up and some down. Over all you might make money. But if all of the stocks you held that went up were capped, they may not offset the losers, over all you might not make money, even with the premium. Depends on volatility and how much premium you can collect."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Right now cc's for GME are very lucrative. I'm in GME for $73 per share. Just did 2 cc's Monday @ 800 exp. 4/16. They netted me over $2,400 each. If the price skyrockets I'm ok with the stock selling @ 800 ea. as that will be $160,000 plus the over $4,800 royalty to invest on the next price crash."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You also should research “Poor mans covered calls” if you are interested in this.  In short you buy a deep in the money call that has a far out expiration date. Then you can sell covered calls against them in the short term. Your long term call ( called a LEAP) acts as collateral for owning 100 shares. You can sell covered calls for a fraction of the price. In your example, you’d probably only have to throw down 5 grand for one AAPL LEAP instead of 12 grand and still collect the same premiums. As other people are saying though, it does cap your upside if your sold calls get exercised"

You buy back apple at $140 but now you can only buy 93.5 shares with your $13,094. You'll need to buy another 7.5 shares for $1050 to do another CC"
03/17/2021,stocks,"A premium of 94 usd is less than 1% compared to your investment of 12500, why even bother? And if you buy back at higher price, you can easily pay more than you earned from the premium, depending on when they exercise.

Options are most profitable when you buy and sell huge number of contracts, instead of writing and sell. But of course the risk is also sky high."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Simply, it’s not too good to be true. Usually the amount you make is very very small. If you have a stock with high IV your returns can be better but you also run the risk of the stock tanking or exploding past your strike. 

My first attempt at a covered call was with SBUX many years ago. It was around $40 and I think I wrote a call at $45. The stock went up, I got exercised, and then watched in horror as it continued to climb to $180... thinking about all the gains I missed from collecting the “free money”."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Take a look at the covered calls strategy guide at option alpha https://optionalpha.com/members/guides-checklists

It goes very in depth about the profitability and potential risks."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You're basically right, and it's a *relatively* safe strategy. You run the risk of underperforming the stock if it spikes higher that the strike that you sold at, but you are correct that you still make a profit. You also have the risk that the stock tanks and you can't sell CC's at a high enough strike/ premium to breakeven any more (unless you just hold until the stock recovers). It's certainly a strategy though but it's not like magically free money and if you're looking to invest long term it's probably easier/ better to just buy and hold."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's not too bad. I've been doing it for a while but have missed out on huge gains when my stocks got called away like gme, bb, plug."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Doing this with a stock that has been trading sideways for a period of time, such as Amazon is the way to go. Stocks with high volitility, this is not the preferred strategy ."
03/17/2021,stocks,"The risk is the opportunity cost from capping your upside, while having a similar downside risk (minus premium)."
03/17/2021,stocks,"If the stock drops you’re in a shitload of trouble. 

It’s VERY risky as we are entering a potential bear market. Very risky."
03/17/2021,stocks,"The biggest mistake in your understanding is that you can “sell the stock and buy back at higher price” when you get assigned; the issue with this is that calls expire generally on Friday after trading so your assignment of it happens, happens off hours and crosses a weekend.

Stocks are volatile across weekend boundaries and if a stock indeed rockets, it’s not going to wait for you to buy back in at a reasonable  price on Monday. Even more so if you set a lower strike price to maximize premium and it rockets past that. This is why covered calls are said to get only 50% of the up side.

You also can’t keep doing it in a bull market because the capital required to buy 100 shares of the stock goes up each time this happens. You’ll end up running out of money. On the other hand, in a real bear market you’ll be losing value in the underlying stock so it’s arguably better to sell and hold cash to buy the dip.

Does that make sense? 

Covered calls especially those near the money are not risk free because you’ll need to buy back at higher prices if the stock goes up and can’t sustain it if it keeps going up. Rolling allows you to adjust this a bit but at the cost of losing your premium gains so it’s like holding with no swing trades.

If it keeps going down you’re worse off than selling to cut losses and buying back later.

There’s no free lunch. Covered calls do best in a flat market where everyone thinks it’s going to rocket or crash but you’re betting on it not doing so."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Great way to make some amount of income, but it’s not as easy as u think.

If u get exercised and have to buy back in at a higher price then u’ll never turn ur position into a long term investment. 

Try telling urself u’re ok with selling at a certain price during a huge break out and see what happens..it’ll make u rethink selling cc’s that are close to ITM when a part of u actually wants to hold the position for a very long time"
03/17/2021,stocks,"you've got the jist of it. there are only 2 things to keep in mind

1. if a share blows by your strike price, you miss out on that revenue (say you get that $130 aapl call in your example, but it ends up closing at $180). you still made money, but less than you would have otherwise

2. if you buy a share to sell CC's on and then it tanks in value, it puts you in kind of a bad spot. your premium doesn't cover the losses, then when the call expires and you do your next round, the desirable premiums could represent a loss if they strike.

now, of course, neither of those things are deal breakers. i'm totally on board with the notion that selling covered calls is AWESOME. my cc income vastly outpaces my dividends.

selling puts is pretty awesome too if you have margin enabled on your account (since you're required to have to have access to the money in case the strike hits, so it just reserves a portion of your ""available for trading"" balance, but obviously you wouldn't want to have actual cash sitting there doing nothing which is why you'd just have it reserve margin room you're not using anyways).

basically you get paid a premium when you sell just like a CC, but instead of doing stuff above the price point, you go the other direction. you say ""i'd totally by aapl if it dropped to $100/share"", then sell something like the $100 4/30 which currently has a 30 cent premium.

if aapl drops below $100 share in the next month and a half, someone can force you to buy the shares you would have bought anyways, and if it doesn't, you just made $30 without even having to buy anything."
03/17/2021,stocks,Everybody is doing it. And the only risk is losing the shares so pick a strike price you are comfortable selling at. Nothing else to consider.
03/17/2021,stocks,Thanks for your reply. I feel quite excited after looking into this strategy - to me it seems like the perfect balance between risk and returns when compared against other investment strategies. I'm gonna start looking for stocks I'm willing to own a hundred of (don't have the liquidity to buy 100 apple stocks right now).
03/17/2021,stocks,"If the stock is dropping, you can also buy back the covered call and sell the stock before expiration.

Using your example - instead of #2 where you're sitting on a losing stock until expiration, you can buy back the call as the stock starts dropping. Assuming this is done correctly, buying back the call should result in a small profit. Then you can dump the stock at a loss without worrying about sitting on it until it crashes. 

Basically, you can still use a stop loss if you have a stock that's covered.

Yes, in this scenario you're most likely losing money but the covered call serves a hedge to lower the impact of that loss."
03/17/2021,stocks,"From then on you can sell cash secured puts every week until it goes down again (or at least for some time until it becomes useless if it rises too much). 

It’s only a long term strategy for relatively stable assets though."
03/17/2021,stocks,Writing covered calls against deep ITM long term calls would be a good strategy if you don't have the money to buy 100 shares outright.
03/17/2021,stocks,I don't think you understand the difference between a covered call and a naked call. A covered call is when you already own the 100 shares for each contract

03/17/2021,stocks,"CC on GME for anything more than a week or two out is risky. Now I'm no expert but as I understand it it's quite rare for options to be exercised before the expiry. So if the stock rises even above you're strike before expiry you're kinda screwed since you can't sell your stock and definitely don't want to rebuy the options. You're only hope is essentially that it closes above 800 on April 16 or that you get lucky and your options are exercised early.

Imo you're missing out on a lot of potential for a little less risk to the underlying."
03/17/2021,stocks,this morning you could've sold a 4/9 215 call for something like 74 and so your shares would've been free and potentially still in your portfolio 😔
03/17/2021,stocks,"This is a good point. If you don't have the capital to buy back into apple couldn't you just find a different stock that trades at similar numbers to apple and switch over to that one instead? But I'm starting to see that the risk is a bit higher than I thought at first - there's only so many companies I would be comfortable owning 100 shares in. It still seems like a strategy I'm gonna get involved with, but I can see how the ROI is representative of the risk now."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You sell CSP at the same strike as the CC that was assigned and collect premium on the held cash. Then if it gets assigned, start selling CC again. Rinse repeat.

Do it with a different stock. Treat stocks like cattle, not pets."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's less than 1%, but that's weekly. I've had it drilled into my head that the safest investment strategy with the best returns is investing into an ETF and hoping for 10% returns annually on a better-than-average year. Selling CC's seems slightly more risky in the sense that you have less room for diversification as you have to own 100 of a share as far as I can tell, but 25% annual ROI makes it seem more than worth the risk of simply holding 100 shares in a reliable stock like apple. It makes it seem to me like you could retire with just $125,000 in savings and live on a $30k 'salary'. Of course this would mean putting 100% of your savings into apple which isn't a great idea, but you could still probably find some room for diversification by splitting this investment into 10/15 similar stocks.

You might pay more than you earned from your premium to buy back into the stock, which is what is meant when people say that selling CC's puts a cap on your upside, but then you're holding a more valuable stock, so you're not actually losing any money, you're just missing out on potential gains had you just simply held the stock. To me the consistency of selling CC's is more than appealing enough to make up for this."
03/17/2021,stocks,"> Doing this with a stock that has been trading sideways for a period of time, such as Amazon is the way to go.

i would imagine amazon isn't going to be realistic for most people in this sub. at over $3k/share, someone is going to need over $300k worth of amazon to sell CC's against it.

of course, if it splits, that would change a lot. AAPL would be a lot harder to CC against than it currently is if it was $500/share."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You can buy the same call strike/date to close your position and sell the stock.

The risk in that case is the stock itself, independent of the covered call. But yes, holding certain volatile stocks is very likely to bite you."
03/17/2021,stocks,"If the stock drops, your call expires worthless. Selling covered calls does not increase the downside risk compared to simply holding stock. In fact, it even lowers the impact of the downturn since you can collect premiums while it falls."
03/17/2021,stocks,"No problem at all! I felt similar when I heard about them for the first time. 

I‘ve been testing the strategy on a paper account for some time now, while trying to find a  good company where the needed investment is reasonable. You‘ll notice that it’s not really as good as it sounds at first - which in no way means it’s bad, just not too good to be true. 

It can be tricky to find the right strike price, and naturally, those that are likely to end ITM are worth much more, which is tempting. 

One thing that you might have missed (I‘m just assuming since you didn’t mention it anywhere) is the possibility to roll a call. If it ends ITM but you don’t want to sell your shares, you can buy it back close to expiration day for about the difference between market and strike. That means you will lose the difference between market and strike, minus the premium you got. That way, you can keep your stocks and sell the next CC right away! You still lost some money that way, but your new call is hopefully set better and you can start recouping your losses right away."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes, generally speaking covered calls are safe to exit during a crash, because the premium of the call option dives with the price of the stock, so you can buy the contract back for credit and then exit, if you need to. 

It's cash secured puts that are hard to exit during a crash and which represents the most dangerous leg of a wheel strategy. If you put near the money, and the stock crashes, you're basically bag holding - no real exit available because when a stock is crashing hard, rolling out and under is going to cost you. 

Still, it's better than getting assigned while the company goes bankrupt. But that's the biggest risk with the wheel strategy and it's why it even works - because there are people on the other side betting against your ""safe"" profits."

also if you're worried about not having enough money to buy 100 shares again, you need to have some rules in place:

1) always have a cash reserve. this helps you manage your position if you need to buy back the call (lets say the stock goes down and now the call you sold is worth like 0.1, buy it back and sell another one when the stock recovers)

2) you can always buy something like 120 shares of the stock the first time. sell 1 covered call and if the stock goes up a lot and the shares get called away you still have 20 and you only need to buy 80 more. this at least helps you in the scenario that the calls are way ITM"

03/17/2021,stocks,"That’s actually a good point to bring up, but your concerns are unfounded. Why? 2 Reasons:

First, under normal circumstances, a call will never get exercised before expiration. Why? It just doesn’t make sense. To put it super simple, as long as there’s time left, that time is worth something. If you own a call with a week left, strike at 50 and an underlying at 60, why would you buy the stock now? The strike price is fixed. It is certain that you can buy it in a week at 50, no matter if it rises to 70, 100 or 1,000. Buying it right now would only open you up to the risk of it falling between now and expiration. If you want to realize your gains right now, you can sell the call for the difference between strike and market (10 in my example) and even some payment for that time (the premium). 

The second reason is that, mathematically, there is no difference between a call getting exercised or you rolling it. If you roll a call, you first have to buy it back. That’ll cost you pretty much exactly the difference between strike and market. The same amount you would lose (by missing out on it) if your shares get sold below market. To go back to the example, you can prevent the call from getting exercised by buying it back for 10, so you keep all your shares that are now worth 60. Or you let them get called away, get 50 for each, and buy them back at 60, paying 10 more than you got. Either way, no real difference (besides tax reasons in many cases). Then you sell the next call. That’s what rolling is, in very simple terms. Actually just a fancy way of saying you close one position and open another right after."
03/17/2021,stocks,"In the OP, part of the strategy mentioned was to re-buy the shares after being called to run the strategy again and that is what is being referred to in the comment.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Cash secured puts carry their own risks, so sure, you can do it to hedge your bet on the call, but there will be scenarios where you lose hard on the bet.

**Scenario 1**: Amazon trading at $100. You sell a covered call for $110 for $1 x 100 = $100. Amazon rockets to $150. You sell a cash secured put at $110 for $0.1 x 100 = $10. Amazon continues to rocket to $1000 over the next year. You've gained $1000 + $100 + $10 = $1110 but lost out on $90000. Selling covered calls + cash puts in this situation is basically equivalent to selling too early and then not wanting to buy back in because ""it's too high already"" - a classic mistake.

**Scenario 2**: Macy's is at $50. Sell a covered call at $52 for $1 = $100 + $200 = $300. Macy goes to $53.5 and you get assigned. Sell a cash secured put at $52 for $100. Macy's crashes to $20. You just got caught bag holding at $52. Total loss = $300 - 3200 = -$2900. Macy's then proceeds to trade at $20 for the next decade, or goes bankrupt, and you're down the entire -$2900 even if you get out.

Both scenarios can and have happened to people in the past.

There's no free lunch with the wheel strategy - it just seems there is because people generally pick ""safe"" stocks. But if the stock is 100% safe, to begin with, then there won't be any one buying options. So there's always risk and you *will* be caught, sooner or later. That's why ""buy and hold"" is always a superior strategy in the long-term if your options strategies are average or below average. Of course, if you know what you're doing, you can beat the market, but that requires skill."

03/17/2021,stocks,"You’re completely right in that there’s no truly free money on the market. Everything has to be paid for somehow. 

Where I kind of disagree with you is that it seems to me like you’re taking fundamental risks of stock ownership and „shift the blame“ towards options. 

For scenario 1, you even say it’s a classic mistake. Why sell a CC for a stock you would hold after it rises 50% in a short time? Why not just buy the call back if you think it might rise or stay at that level? You‘d still be in the green. Granted, it‘ll make the psychological aspect a bit harder. But if the belief that it could go to $1000 wasn’t there when selling the call, it wouldn’t be there without it. 

Scenario 2, you‘d be even deeper in the hole if you just held the stock. Your options cushioned the fall a bit. If you simply bought at $50 and held until $20 that’s 3k down. Buy and hold isn’t superior in this case. 

I absolutely don’t want to make it seem as if there’s no risk, it‘s absolutely there. It’s just very manageable in my opinion. As long as you don’t get greedy for high risk premiums."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah but if the stock shoots up, the call that was sold will have gone up in price. It’s possible that they wouldn’t be able to afford to buy back the call. Or even if they can afford it, they would have lost money on it, since they’d be buying back at a higher price than they sold for. My point is, it’s not free money."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Most brokers will give you temporary margin to do a roll out. That's not the issue.

The issue is that you're actually not making any money when you do a roll out. It totally destroys the profit margin of an option. Granted, you still get the up side of the underlying. But imagine rolling out forever - you'll never collect the premium so it's like holding a stock forever without the flexibility of swing trades.

But it does solve one of the biggest problems with covered calls, which is forced limitations on the up side. Played well, roll outs can give you the *choice* between getting a premium and underlying up side. It's a solid way to hedge the call during bull markets though you'll probably lose money if the underlying moves heavily against you regardless since it's hard to break even on a roll out then."
03/17/2021,stocks,But the share price goes up so you don't lose money. It's just your gain capped
2021-03-17 13:15:55,stocks,"Economic Moats/Competitive Advantage What Warren Buffet calls the ‘economic moat’ we refer to as ‘competitive advantage’. The term refers to a companies ability to keep competition at bay over the long term life cycle of the business, maintain majority market share and favourable economics. What force is stopping or limiting the competitions capability to compete? What stops the competition from cutting their lunch? A company can have one or more of the five types of economic moats: intangible assets, cost advantage, efficient scale, switching costs, network effect. 

Here are Some examples of the economic moats/competitive advantage of some companies (or what I believe to be the moat) :

Apple — Apple’s brand power, the belief in its product superiority by consumers and its ability to create a large cult following, allows the company to price its products at double the competitions and still outsell the competition in the market place. 

Coca-Cola — The powerful brand behind Coke gives them the ability to demand higher margins and outsell the competition. Coke the brand is directly associated with happiness. Coke is a product where the customer will reject the competitions equivalent at a discount, and buy the Coke product at a premium. 

Intel — Intels vertical integration and its operations across the entire supply chain line in the chip sector, gives intel the ability to outdo the competition on every level and hold majority market share. One year intel will focus on chip innovation, the next year it will focus on production innovation and capabilities. Despite fierce competition from AMD and NVIDIA, intel has maintained its market share of the industry.

Amazon.com — Amazon is an operating system for society and daily lives of individuals. It has created a cult following who truly believe Amazon is a necessity of life equal to water, food and oxygen. Some Amazon prime members have and do become suicidal when they lose access to their account. The brand has made itself into an integral part of the day to day lives of individuals, and has made life without Amazon inconceivable for its customers. 

Facebook — Facebook takes advantage of network effects, product and brand power. As more people start using Facebook, then more people will be attracted to Facebook because their friends and everyone they know use it, it becomes a social necessity. Facebooks product and brand is so powerful, even its strongest and fiercest critics still use it.

They're focused on future-looking companies, and their underlying stock prices are still very high, even after the recent tech corrections. However, now that people are getting more vaccinations and countries are starting to open up more, if we are able to return to some of our normal activities, it seems like we should be headed for a bull market in the near-term future.

During times of optimism, growth stocks usually do well. However, I'm still reading lots of negative comments directed at the Ark funds. Shouldn't they do well if we head into a bull market?

So in a ""strong economy"" they get little benefit, but if borrowing costs go up, input costs go up, that is a problem for companies with a lot of debt and little revenue. A lot of these high growth companies get by on debt or issuing equity, which was possible because of the weakness of the rest of the economy (nothing else people wanted to invest in).

do you think I could have done this if the entire market didn't sell off that happened last March from COVID?

Again this is incredibly easy to look up and prove. everyone on the planet knows it happened expect you apparently.

03/17/2021,stocks,"This is actually a great buying opportunity. I'm a CPA and there was no malicious wrong doing here. Basically what's going on which happens frequently in accounting field is interpretation on a highly complex Lease Accounting standard (ASC 842). The standard relates to how you record certain equipment and property leases. A lot of judgement is required on how certain leases are treated. Certain treatments require you to put more liability or expense on your books over a period of time. It just looks like the auditors at the last minute decided that they wanted the company to slightly switch up the treatment when then caused the need for restatement.

Why is this not as bad as people think? Because they are not restating their revenue and sales numbers. If they had to restate on how they are recording sales, then that would be a huge issue. Luckily here is just related to their treatment of some of their expenses and liabilities so it shouldn't affect their continued outlook on revenue targets in the future.

(Except for fuelcell, plug and irobot, never heard of the above companies)

Checking for overlap between the two, I found only FATE therapeutics(according to 
https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php)

What do you guys think? Too early to say MOON will win over ARKK in the long term? 

Ps: since I am based in EU, I can't buy either of these etfs. However, arkk has inspired me to buy into baidu and tdoc is my biggest holding (bought before I heard of Arkk). Regarding Moon, only company i own that overlaps with the moon holdings is plug (but not as individual holding, but through IQQH). Plug is 10% of iqqh, and iqqh is my biggest holding"

Wat?  No it wasn’t."
03/17/2021,stocks,I think the problem is that they have to do what they can to avoid moving the price too much. The point at which you are moving the price isn’t related to how large your fund is. So there is kind of an upper limit on the dollar value of what you can buy at once. So when you are small you can pick up a position that is 5 percent of your portfolio so when it doubles in price you get a solid return. That same position if you are big could be .05% of your fund. If that doubles in price it doesn’t really move your total needle that much.

03/17/2021,stocks,"The kinds of companies that most people are investing in are worth billions of dollars, and the average person is probably investing hundreds to thousands of dollars (*maybe* a shade over a million if it's your life savings and your upper middle to upper class). So even if you invested all of that into a single company you'd be looking at a 0.1% share of the votes. And any investor will recommend diversifying your portfolio, so even if you are quite well off you're not going to have anything close to that much. Add to that the fact that most votes are for stuff like ""Certify Steve Duff as finance officer"", ""Confirm B&C accounting for the internal audits"", or ""pay the board their salaries"". There's not much there that you'd really care about if you weren't already pretty involved in the company.

Obviously all of that changes when you're investing millions to billions, or you're investing in really small companies (that probably wouldn't be on a public exchange). But if you're doing any of that then you really shouldn't be taking advice from r/stonks"

TL;DR Do you think this stock will have a run up prior to FDA approval followed by a dip before the announcement or is this going to be a situation where the announcement comes unexpectedly and it would be easy to miss that upward movement because there seems to be no set date? Also, how do you think the stock is going to perform this week, is it going to continue on a downwards trend?

Hey I've been looking into NNOX. I started pulling the trigger on my buy but my main broker doesn't have them so I had to buy them through my bank and actually old school telephone call them like a dinosaur to finish getting the account setup.

Of course it had to go up while that was going on. Stocks always go up when I'm planning to buy in. They know.

I'm leaning more towards being bullish because I think even without the FDA approval they still have a market.

I'm planning to go long on them. I'm bullish because of the distuptive business model more so than the technology.

I'm just wondering if I should buy now or wait for a dip. I know other companies tend to have a run up before FDA approval and then an immediate dip just prior. But there doesn't seem to be a set date and not a lot of confidence in the company because their main innovation isn't really ""new"" just cheaper and more convenient. But that's also why I'm fine taking the risk of actually holding through the FDA approval because I think this actually increases the odds it will pass.

Is it going to run up and then dip before approval or is it possible this is going to be an outlier where the approval is suddenly announced and it's possibly too late to catch that upwards movement?

It's also gone down a bit today. Do you think it's going to keep sinking this week?"
03/17/2021,stocks,I think it will trade sideways until FDA approval. The risky money is in already. It’s mostly going to be people just positioning for the FDA announcement. IMHO people and institutions will pile in after

I understand basic questions are to be posted in the general thread, but I have scoured the Internet for an answer to this question and have not found one--it is not a basic question, it seems.

So, how might I determine this? Is there a listing somewhere?

I got slapped with a $50 commission fee by Fidelity on a trade that was quite literally listed as having a $0 commission. After the trade executed, the commission fee was *factored into my cost basis.* Fidelity accepts no responsibility for that ""because OTC stocks list and de-list from the DTC all the time."" As if it's totally okay for them to approve a trade for a specific amount, and then slap me with a fee I didn't agree to.

The first time I purchased a non-DTC eligible stock, I was warned that there would be a commission fee. This time, there was no such warning. In fact, it feels like I was straight-up lied to by my broker about the cost of the trade (for the record, I am switching entirely to Schwab for regular trades and E\*trade for certain OTCs).

Does anyone know if or how it's possible to determine an OTC stock's DTC eligibility?"

2021-03-17 08:35:35,stocks,"Lumen Technologies Inc (LUMN) - Too Late To the Party? r/stocks 

I'm a huge fan of Dr. Michael Burry and how he manages Scion Asset Management, LLC.  The guy does his due-diligence and thinks about his investment opportunities from an outside perspective.  If the numbers and story pencil, he will bet against anyone and doesn't let the court of public opinion cloud his judgment.  

I'm inquiring about the recent Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) $LUMN trade.

Based on my research, Scion Asset Management acquired 1.15M shares of $LUMN at an average value of $9.74 per share.  This trade accounts for approx. 8.02% of Scion's portfolio.  If we're looking at Burry's past investments, he's usually one of the first players to the table.  

Lumen has not only rebranded their name and marketing efforts, but their entire business strategy moving forward by selling B2B data and fiber optic services since many customers are moving away from phone lines/services: (direct quotes from my research)...

1. ""**Lumen** is a measure of the brightness of light, and the company’s competitive advantage this century has come from its massive fiber network, stretching 450,000 route miles. That has helped CenturyLink survive even as consumers cut their home phone lines in favor of wireless providers and switched off DSL in favor of faster alternatives.  But transporting light signals can also be a commodity service. Lumen is now pushing to offer more higher-value applications and enterprise services directly to its customers, reflected in the company’s new motto: “**The Platform for Amazing Things**.”
2. ""Lumen, which was primarily an ISP/Phone company, stepped up their B2B and backbone connectivity to major Internet companies which the purchase of Level3. They'll be key to serving as the fiber backbone for 5G.""

Earlier today, I submitted a limit buy order for $LUMN @ $14.00 which won't be executed until tomorrow when the market opens.  I don't believe this trade will turn a real profit for 1-2 years as turning a battleship of this size takes a significant amount of time and resources.  But looking at the story and fundamentals, the strategy is sound.  Outside the rebranding and change of strategy, Lumen is using some of the newly minted capital to paydown, high interest, debt. 

Am I too late on this trade?  Are there any other bits of information I'm missing out on?  I don't see too many cons which worries me.  If you have any additional pros/cons, please let me know.  Any responses will be happily received!"

03/17/2021,stocks,"It is always difficult when the stock had a recent runup. But if you have looked at the valuation, did your DD and think that it will have a decent return in 1-2 years why not have a small position on it?"

03/17/2021,stocks,"Not if you think they'll keep paying off their debts and building out fiber to migrate and expand their existing Centurylink customer base, or if you think their edge compute strategy is going to work.

I'm in at a bit over $11 and holding since I wasn't impressed with their penetration rate for FTTH (28% as of Q4) and they're not having the growth in enterprise that I want to see yet, but if I wasn't more excited by DISH as a 5g play I'd probably still be buying."
2021-03-17 08:34:29,stocks,"Question about Negative Beta Good day everyone, I have been reading several posts and articles about Beta value (Correlation and Volatility indicator for stocks). While it is common to have stocks with a beta value of more than 0 (Correlated to market at varying volatility ranges), it is highly unlikely (according to many sources like investopedia) for a stock to have a negative beta. Some typical stock categories with a negative beta include commodities (gold, etc.), shorted stocks (Stock market index goes up, but the shorted stock goes down) and the usual: Very poorly performing stocks (after downgraded ratings). Furthermore, such cases usually result in short term changes to beta value (i.e. Beta value of 0.5 to -0.5 for a few weeks due to a massive share price drop in a bullish market), and the beta values usually return to their previous values soon after. 

As I have just started reading into this topic, I have two questions:

1. Are there any other stock types that fall into this category of negative beta?
2. For negative beta to happen, the market's movement is inversely correlated to the movement of stock price, which happens to the stocks types mentioned above. However, is it possible (at all, theoretically or practically) for a stock to actually affect the larger market? 

I'm sorry if there are any mistakes, as these information are all obtained from self reading and learning. Please correct me wherever possible so that I can nib the mistakes at the bud. Thanks!"

03/17/2021,stocks,"You rarely find equities with a negative beta because the value of an equity is derived from its perceived future value. This perceived future value is not idiosyncratic, in that the company is the only factor in the perceived value, in reality there are underlying systematic factors that are always baked into a single company’s stock price (e.g. economic growth, inflation, animal spirits, etc.). For a company to have a truly negative correlation to the market it needs to be able to survive betting against the human tenacity to growth and earn. Which is not a position many people would take. 

If, in theory, there were a truly negative beta equity out there, I believe that it would only be short term and then the company would find equilibrium to some low (though positive) beta. Given the transitory nature of corrections and recessions, it would be practically improbable for a negative beta equity to exist for long."
03/17/2021,stocks,"The stockmarket goes up in the long term. If there is a company or type of companies that have negative beta for a long time, their value will approach zero, meaning they will probably go bankrupt and get taken off the exchange.

If the stockmarket would stop going up in the long run, then it would be possible for such negative beta companies to persist for a long time."
03/17/2021,stocks,GME has negative beta lately 😁
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes, I understand that in a bull market, a poorly performing stock would have negative beta. But what about a negative beta during a bullish market? It would mean that despite the market going up in the Mid-long term, the stock would have to mirror the market movement through out the bullish period right? Assuming the stock goes up as well. 

That’s also true, but one would think that a negative market will also result in negative sentiment across the stocks in the market as well, it would be hard for single tickers to go against the direction of the market due to the movements, majority of which are made by large players."

03/17/2021,stocks,Thanks! Yes I read same. No serious side effects.  All articles yesterday only used headlines that were negative. So guessing shorts were closing out positions before possible boost thursday
03/17/2021,stocks,Yeah all good news. Just dropped. Only negative I found was insider selling but they normally do that every 3 months or so.
03/17/2021,stocks,Yep. Crazy but it drew my attention when it held at 6.40 and read up on stock and all was good news. So maybe was a short covering because he thought stock rise happening? Got me. Figure take a gamble since company seems solid but if anyone finds something I missed let me know asap 🤣🤣🤣
03/17/2021,stocks,Cash sheet looks good. Debt to cash appears reasonable. One competition I know of. Revenue steadily increasing. The buy rating and the stock price estimate to 13 was done today.

2021-03-17 07:48:22,stocks,"$PLTR Alex Karp Interview: FULL BREAKDOWN 3/16 Karp's interview is being overblown.  The headlines are clickbait.  He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.

Karp would rather put his focus on having the company put its ""best foot forward"" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.

He was asked in the middle of the interview ""How would he entice new commercial customers?""

He then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.

They talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.

HE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the ""INVESTORS"" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.

He can't on camera ""PUMP"" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.

TLDR

So about an hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.

Foundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.  IBM and AWS bow down to PLTR.

Intrigued yet?

03/17/2021,stocks,Are we supposed to know which interview you're talking about?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Those partnerships are not exciting as all the potential revenue from then is already priced in....and more. The company does not provide great earnings, they over emphasize on their growth percentage when it was almost all government contract and barely any commercial.  My issue with the stock is that the valuation of a company that provides such mediocre results at 40b means they have to execute perfectly just to avoid a drop in price. I don't want to pay such a premium for the hype. They could have a great product, but execution of sales and revenue is what makes the return on investment. You hear all the shareholders pitch how they're not a new company just because they're new to the market.  This leads me to a larger concern to why I should expect them to get it together in the next 10 years when they haven't in the previous 20.

All that doesn't really matter on here though because the pltr  bulls love to cover their ears to any bear case. They downvote anyone with an opposing view,  so all you'll see is the great hype posts.  This will cost retail investors money as they're drawn in and will buy at any price because there's no skepticism on the current valuation. I would buy pltr, but not anywhere over 25b figuring in the current partnerships (and thats still a risky price based on revenue.) No one can seem to give a projection to how much revenue each blue chip deal is in dollars and cents for annual earnings at the end if the day, they just hear the names and scream buy. Math out a generous stream of income just from those deals and you still wont be talking 2x their current revenue which even at a generous multiplier puts 40b high.

So many who own complain about their stagnant company share price where there are many other companies providing great returns. Then they counter with the potential for years to come.  Well,  then stop complaining about today's price,  it's high and it's going to take a while before they can grow into 100b company.  Frankly,  I'd bet they won't get to 100b. Most companies don't,  but the consensus of the retail investor is that every new tech company in the market should be hundreds of billions."

Lol Palantir is still yet to make money after over 15 years of existence. Even with that, their tech is not scalable, needs deep integration and not generic.

To top it all, what they need is fundamentally AI domain and some company like Google can easily beat them at this and integrate with their cloud.

Now tell me any other argument apart from “they are patriot”? If you invest for that reason, that is fine but stop with this BS long term view.

Any big tech company like Amazon, Google or smaller like AMD has long term view but also aware of short term needs to survive as business.

Edit: I guess people are simply after confirmation bias. Good luck bag holding for “long term” growth when Cathie pulls out."

This is super anecdotal, but what really stands out to me is their culture.

They seemed genuinely interested in the impact they were making. Obviously that's what they are paid to do, but something about them just sets them apart from all the companies I saw in that building. They really left an impression on me.

Weaponizing AI is very dangerous thing to do. The scientists in Google who refused to work on the project, like Jeff Dean ([https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/09/googles-ai-chief-on-automl-autonomous-weapons-and-the-future/](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/09/googles-ai-chief-on-automl-autonomous-weapons-and-the-future/)) did that because they understand the deeper implications.

I work in technology architecture and in a world where the amount of data we collect is growing exponentially, data architecture and data ontology is the seed of all information systems. With more and more unstructured data we create, the ability to automate ontologies is game changing. 

If something is indeed ""just another data analytics/mining"" company, the last companies who would partner up are your IBMs and Amazons. These companies eat other industries for breakfast (for IBM, at least in the past). 

So if a company that made one of the world's most advanced intelligence platforms (IBM Watson) and another which turned from an online bookstore to arguably the world's most disruptive company (e-commerce, cloud, logistics, groceries, video, now healthcare) decides to partner up with Palantir (a mere 5 months after Palantir started ringing their bells and whistles), I wouldn't bet against them."
03/17/2021,stocks,Well you're a gambler sir
03/17/2021,stocks,Good for you
03/17/2021,stocks,At least support your statement with arguments. You really are not going to sway people the other way by just saying its not going to outperform the market.

03/17/2021,stocks,Did I do good?
03/17/2021,stocks,"I think you're way overreacting man.

I've been reading non-stop Reddit posts for months about Palantir, and I've literally seen no one try to cancel them.

I don't agree with Thiel's politics. But I'm not here for politics, I'm here to discuss stocks."
03/17/2021,stocks,From what I understand they worked with certain companies in the past that used PLTR’s software and that’s all it takes these days. By that same logic if someone runs into a crowd of people with a Ford then the media should bash everything Ford does moving forward.
03/17/2021,stocks,You obviously don't have the attention span to watch the interview in its entirety.
03/17/2021,stocks,"He just calls them out appropriately for previously being ""enlightened"" then selling out to China for a few bucks. He's the only tech company that says no to China and it makes him a pariah, but I like it."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I’ll preface this by saying that the beauty of this exchange is that there will be a point at which it’s apparent which of us is right. With that, this is about prediction, not opinion, so there is no need to argue. 

This is not financial advice. 

I believe that PLTR will push above $50 within the next year. 

Though they’re not yet profitable, the product has been proven many times over. This is a key point at present, since they’re in position ahead of future potential competition. I agree that they are susceptible to future disruption from other entities, but that they have awhile before that is relevant. 

Existing contracts have expanded, and they’re adding more contracts. I expect this to snowball.

I’m holding PLTR with an active eye over the next 2-5 years. I feel that they’re low risk at present, with risk increasing over time."
03/17/2021,stocks,Why did you think this comment was worth copying and pasting
03/17/2021,stocks,"Because they’ve continually raised capital as a private company until going public as a direct listing (not an IPO, note the difference because it actually matters here). Had it not been for RSUs and current notes they would’ve turned a profit their second quarter as a public company. Please learn to read a balance sheet."

To put it bluntly unless you have proof of what Google's board thinks or some public statements, you're just making it up... all the Fortune 500 companies promote diversity or racial equality at a minimum as a business advantage if not a corporate responsibility. It's been long known that a more diverse workforce is more productive... not just for different kinds of ideas but also hard facts like different holidays or different vacations. So apparently being a ""social justice warrior"" is normal business practice for a large corporation. It didn't start with the Internet or politics."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Lol so google hired people and apple/palantir hired corporate drones?

03/17/2021,stocks,Their erp suite is just a way for them to connect their platform to a company’s ERP. It’s not meant to replace ERP functionality and running on AWS just means it’s like every other application being developed.

03/17/2021,stocks,Long term holder and supporter of PLTR myself but I don't think Karp is an engineer?
03/17/2021,stocks,"I worked with pred drones, so all the products associated with that business.


Being an engineer doesn't cause someone to sound like Elon Musk...even tho he isn't even an engineer so that point makes even less sense.


Buying and selling a stock doesn't mean you only care about the stock short term, that is ridiculous. What CEO of a company only cares about the short term? Thats a nonsensical statement.


I didnt bet against Elon and I'm not betting against karp. I have thousands of shares of PLTR and 50 in TSLA."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I already said I would buy under 25b valuation.  Just as I said,  I like the company.  I just don't like the stock price.  I think if it holds,  it will trade sideways for a while with ebbs and flows to the share holders. As mentioned they hope to do 5 billion by 2024. There are software companies who do that business today valued in that 40-60b range already and they're already doing whet pltr is hoping to do."
03/17/2021,stocks,But what product?  In every interview they always avoid answering that question. I watched this one today on CNBC and learned nothing.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Commercial growth by their own presentation was less than 10%. The rest was government.  The reason I know it's priced in,  is because I can read a financial,  and there's nothing about what they bring in dollars and cents wise puts them closer to revenue.  As an investor,  I need income results to yield returns that make sense.  We're in this to make money,  not pipe dreams. Those partnerships are just a handful of deals.  Just because they are big companies,  doesn't make them big streams of revenue.  You take dollars and cents to the bank, not a popularity contest of clients."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You are utterly indoctrinated my friend and can't listen to anything that doesn't paint Palantir in a rosy picture. And I say this as someone that's long and bullish, but stop with your delusion."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Bought more at the dip today, am I doing this right?"
03/17/2021,stocks,Don't you love FUD ruckeers?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Their biggest customer is the government. Our government is up to it's eyeballs in debt and constantly under pressure to reduce costs. Their business opportunities in the private sector are almost purely speculative at this point with no hard data on contract amounts, length of contract, services to be provided, etc. 

Also, their platform development plan (what they do with their software in the future... what they are working on) is practically non-existent. 99% of the time, in the software world, this means that they have no real plan. If you have a great plan on where you software is going, you talk about it. You brag about it. You give your customers confidence that the things they want the software to do are being worked on or are at least planned for. PLTR does not have this. 

Good enough?"
03/17/2021,stocks,You're a pump and dump.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Nah dude. There was a guy in here today telling me Thiel threw ketamine parties with boys and was going to get #me too’d. 
I reminded him of defamation laws. They’re in here watching trying to bring morale down about the company. Fuck those people."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Oh...it’s everything for them. Thiel doesn’t act like a gay man should. He doesn’t support “the community”. They support law enforcement in their job. It’s ridiculous. Last week they were after Dr Zeuss books. Now pltr. All this is an issue but Google filming your every move from covert eye glasses...not an issue. 
I think I’ll buy more pltr tomorrow because I HATE the Chairman Mao cultural cancel revolution asshats.

Where can I buy a PLTR shirt? I want to wear it as much as possible to piss them off more. I’m going to wear it in a gay pride parade."
03/17/2021,stocks,"See, Palantir only attracts douchebags 🤷‍♂️"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Don’t get me wrong. But the same people that believes it is long term, are not okay admitting it has high valuation even today. If it is long term, expect your returns in long term."

03/17/2021,stocks,You mean the 6 cents per share adjusted earnings?

03/17/2021,stocks,"""If I don't build this then my enemy will"" is a very popular argument when it comes to weapons and technology. It was used very extensively in the case of nuclear weapons too, e.g. ""We need to build a doomsday machine before the soviets do"". However, this type of logic is very dangerous, and people have realized that; that's why we have the nuclear arms control agreement and we don't live the constant fear of being blown into pieces. We need to do the same thing for AI."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I should’ve been more clear. 

What would you like to see the stock price at?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Disclaimer: I wouldn't call myself a Palantir expert, I've personally never used their tech. 

From my understanding it combines multiple data sources into one platform. For example, say a criminal is in both Facebook's database and also in the FBI's. Palantir would be able to merge the data in a presentable and readable format. 

I'm a Junior Developer by trade, so this sounds incredibly attractive to me, as I know how annoying working with multiple data sets can be. That's why I jumped onboard 4-5 months back @$24. However, I'm also new to the market, and didn't really understand the financials/valuation at the time of purchase. Seeing Palantir at a market cap of 50x sales worries me now, I'm not sure how relevant that statistic is but I see other growth companies trading at much less."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Their Foundry platform is basically data analytics /cloud computing software. I read somewhere about how Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure have the same functionalities as Foundry. I also read that PLTR differs from AWS/Azure because their service teams help clients build/code solutions within Foundry, but the services package costs more. Im guessing governments choose PLTR over the competition for their extra services."

That's higher than Refinitiv analyst estimates of about $309 million in revenue for the first quarter."""

They have provided data on contract amounts and lengths even in their recent quarterly earnings call. So, I am unsure where you are getting that non-info from. Do they show each and every contract individually? Obviously not because thats sensitive information. In terms of future development and their current focus its on modularity so it makes it easier to integrate their software into other ERP and gives possibility for use of smaller/medium companies."

03/17/2021,stocks,"This is absolutely a guess, I have no knowledge of the subject, but I'd say that they might have chosen PLTR over AWS or Azure due to antitrust issues with Amazon and Microsoft as well. 

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook are on the knife's edge right now (as in, the last and next couple of years). People are worried about their personal data, there is tons of scandals with how they use it to influence people, and these giants being too big and too powerful are something that (at least publically), both left and right seem to agree. I think everyone knows that they will not be allowed to operate as they do now forever, so I'd guess 'the government would try to avoid being dependent on them as well. 

(For the record, I'm not naive, I am pretty sure that the government will not ""save the people"" from this. They probably have most politicians in their pocket on both ends of the spectrum, to some degree, and politicians love what tech can do for them, so I doubt they will put a *real* stop to it. But at least publically, there is scrutiny, and likely, there will be changes on how they can/will operate)."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don't want to be sarcastic,  but let's say they do grow the revenue in the first quarter by 23 million dollars over the projection.  How many billions do you think we should add to the market cap for that? Should they now be worth 60 billion,  perhaps 80?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Ok then... let's look at some other signals... 

At the end of Feb., 3 PLTR executives sold 2.7 million shares. Ask yourself... why would they do that? Yes, the are probably mostly paid in stock, but which situation is more likely? All 3 executives needed the money right then and there OR All 3 executives believed that's the highest price they would be able to get for a very long time? 

Also... a quote directly from Karp in this interview: ""We’re in this for the long haul. If you are speculating or you’re thinking about this short-term, there are plenty of other things to invest in. If you want something else, it’s a huge world. Buy some other stock. You don’t have to buy Palantir. No one is forcing you.”

The CEO is practically saying ""Don't expect the stock price go anywhere anytime soon."" What does he mean by long haul? 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? Who the hell knows. Either way, it's a signal to me that the company leadership does not expect their stock to perform at or above market levels anytime soon."

He was one of the people whose duty was to press the button, but he refused to. 

""On 26 September 1983, the nuclear early-warning system of the Soviet Union reported the launch of one intercontinental ballistic missile with 4 more missiles behind it, from bases in the United States. These missile attack warnings were suspected to be false alarms by Stanislav Petrov, an officer of the Soviet Air Defence Forces on duty at the command center of the early-warning system. He decided to wait for corroborating evidence—of which none arrived—rather than immediately relaying the warning up the chain-of-command. This decision is seen as having prevented a retaliatory nuclear attack against the United States and its NATO allies, which would likely have resulted in an escalation to a full-scale nuclear war.""

03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes. It's a proverbial comparison back from security analysis with Dodd and Graham referring to diet term price movements. 

I currently have 32 companies in long in,  I usually do not disclose for the sense that I'm not a professional or analyst and I would hate people to take my recommendations and lose money. Some of these holdings are 5 years plus.  I'll throw one example out there.  I bought a ton of ARWR back through 2014-2016 starting in the 5$ range, after they dropped from the teens.  The HEPB thing intrigued me after what Gilead did for hep C.  I thought this was the surefire low price.  I rode down to around 2$ after they scrapped their original IV DPC delivery of the rna, to develop the subQ version. I was in a loss for a few years before they took off.   They are 1 of my 32 holdings (much trimmed to take profits and rebalance.) I don't know if I would buy them at today's price.

I generally eye up good companies dumped on poor short term sentiment. To answer your question,  I added companies like Sarepta, and Bluebird to my watch list on bio. I haven't pulled the trigger, as I'm right now looking into the pipelines since they're in the billions opposed to my initial buy of arwr in the 200m range.  I have PLTR as a watch for software,  but not ready to buy at this level.  I sold off 3D systems this year after running up since buying in Sept around 5$.... so I would like to get back in that space,  I'm eyeing SSYS now since they just diluted, and are better valued as a major competitor. I'll disclose one other,  long ADSK since around $130. I think they're a great play as the software company to support 3D printing. If you believe that manufacturing parts will eventually become digital on demand,  their potential growth is enormous.  I also eye XL. They just got hammered, and provide a great bridge EV play for trucking.  Most EV plays are valued at 2-10b without product on the road.  XL has product,  a value under 2b. I don't think it'll be easy to go fully electric from ICE in heavy transports.  They'll likely be a short term play for less than 5 years. 

The only thing I can say is diversify into many of industries,  don't go too tech heavy which is easy to do these days.  I've found more peace when one company or segment does not take up a majority of my portfolio."

03/17/2021,stocks,"> And I sure as hell wouldn’t be showing my cards to the competition.

I work in software development, and that's not how software companies work. If you have a solid plan and you believe in the strength of your product, you tell everyone about it. You want the competition to know that you are so far ahead of them that they shouldn't even try to compete. You want your current customers and potential customers that you have tons of new features and functionality that is in the pipeline and being worked on. You want to show strength and a confident development plan. PLTR isn't signaling that.

Like I said, I could be completely wrong about PLTR, and if I am, I will gladly admit it. But, ever since the Kathie Woods hype died down, they have done nothing but underperform the market. Even today... down 3x what the NASDAQ is down."

One thing I’ve noticed in my IPO plays is that a lot of the time public sentiment has more effect on the price then anything else day 1. So setting some google alerts and watching the news leading up has proved of some value to me, when dealing with IPO."

I later took the $13k and put it into ARKW when it took a large position in Roblox. I know this doesn’t give me full exposure to Roblox but does give me exposure."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Un hun, IPOs definitely may be worth following for the sake of observation of the market's overall psychological status. How they play out can indicate how mature a bear market is by how excessive the enthusiasm.

And finally, the stock itself can be a good long-term investment prospect. But first day and first week valuation can very wide of any reality.

2021-03-17 06:50:59,stocks,"Is it just me or does ARK look like a pyramid scheme? I did really well this year betting on ARKs holdings, but recently I began looking at CathiesArk charts. It seems like every time a stock of theirs began to crash ARK bought to stop the downward movement.  This is especially evident in their top 20 holdings.   


 About a week ARK drastically cut its buying, and liquidated 50% of paypal, all of TSM, and large chunks of several other  stocks.   
Right now ARK is slowly selling off most of its biotech stocks to pay for the slow pump on its top 10 holdings.

I think that one big outflow day and ARK will have to liquidate a ton just to keep its head above water.   


Am I crazy to think that one big outflow could snowball into a rapid liquidation event??


edit: some people have mentioned rebalancing. All I see is her holdings increasing massively on EVERY crash. Recently is the one of the only times I've seen her sell. The Paypal and Taiwan semiconductor liquidation looks like a mass liquidation to free up cash. Am I missing something?"

This phenomenon was described by one academic group from Berkeley and shortly following this discovery another independent group from Harvard applied it to a mammalian system. Originally, the crisper technology was used as a molecular biology technique at a basic science level to create unique cell lines, etc. What CRSP is trying to do is apply this technology for clinical applications. There are several challenges as you can imagine and frankly for this company to go all in on crisper is risky, but huge reward if/when it works. They are working with other pharma company's like vertex I believe so there can be a greater chance of success there. Honestly this is how pharma goes it either works and you have it.... Or not.

You can even mow your own lawn, using a Craftsman mower, and you can sell your services as well, making money.

03/17/2021,stocks,"I'd also like to add that for a lot of biotech, they spin out of technology developed by people at academic institutes. For example, professors and researchers will create the technology and be named in the patent, but because they work for a university, the university owns the patent. This is all stipulated when you're hired/enrolled for school. 

Companies can be started by the creators, but they'll license the technology from the university. I believe this is the case of CRSP.

But it's not just startups that do this. Large companies like Bayer, Pfizer, etc will also license technology or therapeutics from universities. They just don't have the manpower or resources to study everything they want to, so it's good business to find academics who have and license it.

03/17/2021,stocks,"As another commenter suggested, I go with ARKG. It’s wayyyy too early. I saw another comment mentioning that CRISPR will end organ transplant rejection? Sure, but if that takes so long to develop that it doesn’t occur in your lifetime or occurs when you’re really old, why invest in it? I’d invest in a broad genomics ETF like ARKG to capitalize on what I think are going to be the real money makers in the field in the next couple decade: genetic sequencing and bioinformatics, while still having a stake in CRISPR (there’s been a HUGE rise in prevalence of single-cell genetic sequencing and advanced bioinformatics amongst biomedical scientists (am earning my PhD in Bioengineering, see it every day)). While CRISPR has had a huge impact and will continue to have an enormous impact, I think media hype and oversimplification is often confused for change-the-entire-world-in-a-decade type potential. That being said, if people are excited about something, price will go up in the short term whether the company changes the world or not, so maybe do invest. But there’s a lot of growth yet to occur in the industry - bugs in the BASIC science of CRISPR are still being worked out, let alone meaningful widespread clinical translation (although there has been some clinical translation). So there are still many decades for companies to rise and fall, new companies to become the “big players.” If you are going to invest in a single company now that’s purely CRISPR based, I do think CRSP is the move. But it seems a bit risky for me.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Advantage? I believe they don't have one.

When it comes to scienceing, especially with CRISPR--Cas9, is that it's really, really hard. In this specific case pretty much hit and. So this publicly traded company just has to keep sciencing like crazy to science a science. In the meantime the other scientists at several other non-public (the best ones, IMO are not public) and public companies are sciencing. So while no doubt these scientists are scienceing their science, there's also the next guy scienceing their science and, in this case in particular, they're all throwing darts in the dark hoping to hit bullseye, patents or no.

So yeah, go ahead and invest, but fundamentally all biotech companies are risky af. I'd personally look into ones that are using CRISPR-Cas9 to non-humans, if there are any in the public space."

03/17/2021,stocks,"As someone who is a clinician and has used CRSIPR in real patients, I will say they are quite aggressive. I’m a little nervous about the solid tumor trials as I don’t know if their play on CAR-T cellular therapy will be effective like it is in hematologic malignancies. With that said, their ability to do allogeneic cells would be MONUMENTAL if effective."

03/17/2021,stocks,"As someone in the field, I wholeheartedly disagree. They aren’t using prime editing like BEAM is using. There’s too many off targets for CRSP therapies to get approved by the FDA. Prime editing has the advantage of no off targets which is huge, especially in the progeria therapy they’re working on"
03/17/2021,stocks,This is a great response and I upvote so I hate to be that person but it’s “CRISPR”... It’s an acronym.
03/17/2021,stocks,"So as a Molecular Biology student that often study’s the use of CRISPR this is a major misconception. CRISPR has and will be extremely effective in altering cell lines as you stated but the application is not “clinical” overall it’s literally finding the exact gene in the millions of genes of our genome, that for example causes over proliferation (cancer) or causes a autoimmune response channel to stay open(lupus). So in short, the application of CRISPR is already present it’s now just the thousands of trials that must be done on different cell lines to find these vital genes. It is also significantly more complex than that but for simplicities sake I’m gonna leave it at that."

Do you know of any private companies that are competing with CRSP/BEAM? 

Also what’s your thoughts on NVTA? Are they slightly different to the two above?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Fellow molecular and cell bio student. My school literally has a lab class I’ve taken on trying to use CRISPR on an organism to see a visible mutation. Cancer is probably a bad example for targeting with CRISPR just because cancer tends to mutate like a mother fucker. Grabbing mutations like they’re achievements in “Plague Inc.” to the point where it’s likely that a stage 3 cancer has the identity of about 15+ cancers even if it’s localized to 1 organ :( CRISPR is really good at targeting a single type of gene so we see some actual therapeutics already being tried (see: sickle cell anemia cured in a patient, and hopefully other single nucleotide mutation-causing diseases [muscular dystrophy and the like]). Some other reasons why CRISPR, the silver bullet that it is, isn’t as popular in therapeutics: “off-target” changes in your DNA, and ethics. Off target changes are pretty rare but imagine trying to fix a gene with an intricate Apple Maps system, only for Apple Maps to send you else where and absolutely wreck your body. Ethics: what if these changes affect the gonads! Now we’ve created genetically modified humans with little understanding of how that can affect future generations. Food for thought! Id still buy a couple stocks with what savings I have 🥴"
03/17/2021,stocks,"As somebody in technology and having a basic understanding of AI, would you say CRISPR is dependent on ""training data"" for AI alogorithms or is it something different. Like does it take genes from 1000 people WITH a specific cancer and a control group of 1000 without and then try to learn to identify the common denominator genetically for that cancer? I haven't spent a lot of time reading about it, and I feel like the material is a little over my head sometimes."

03/17/2021,stocks,"oops, a typo, sorry"
03/17/2021,stocks,"That’s true. Either way, we are 8-10 years before the inflection point for gene therapies, and a lot can happen to CRSP, BEAM, Mammoth, and so many others before we hit that point."
03/17/2021,stocks,I’m loooooooong on Beam and only Beam. Slowing DCAing. We’ll see where I am in 15 years.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Best case scenario the trial goes exceedingly well and they bring their product to market by 2024. As every biotech goes, it’s a gamble, but if you held from now to 2024 and things go to plan, you’ll never see today’s prices again."
03/17/2021,stocks,"So yes and no, and that’s the hardest part. So in some diseases you theoretically could do this, and would need even less individuals if you identified the specific cancer gene, as you can specifically test said gene further to determine its use in the disease or process. With cancer though this becomes very complicated because many different genes may be activating/inhibiting and just overall interacting with one another to create the outcome we see. At some point I strongly believe self-learning AI will be able to recognize the patterns and ways cells interact more effectively than humans do now. This being a reality would be a game changer and allow us to determine significantly more about diseases, and the way cells even work and dare I say it maybe one day cure cancer. 
I also feel like things are flying over my head when reading most of these CRISPR articles and it’s my major. This shit is dense and it takes me hours to read an single article so don’t worry!"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah definitely tough. As a scientist, I enjoy investing in biotech but it’s definitely a challenge with how speculative it is"
03/17/2021,stocks,"If CRSP and similar ""technology"" received the attention amd financing that COVID-19 has, how quickly do you think it would reach where it needs to be? This topic is incredibly interesting to me."

03/17/2021,stocks,What about DTIL and PSTX? And doesn't SGMO have some sort of patent advantage over CRISPR?
03/17/2021,stocks,"I imagine of you can isolate certain sections potentially affected, it might be possible to do a ""diff"" concept similar to code in a version control system to look for differences. I think that maybe more important than actually finding genes to apply therapy, this could be good for even finding potential health issues early or before they fully manifest right?

Edit: Also thank you for the in-depth response."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I think those 10 year projections would be cut down to 5 years. I believe there’s only 19 pharmaceutical companies studying gene editing therapies right now, and only 5 (?) of those are publicly traded. If you double or triple the amount of players in the field, reduce the FDA wait times in half, and increase funding by 250%, we’d have therapies for everything from Chediak-Higashi to male-pattern baldness. I truly believe these therapies are the future of medicine"
03/17/2021,stocks,Yep. Same feelings here.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Both have great futures in my opinion. 

As far as your comment goes, it’s not that straightforward. There’s a lot of unknowns as far as patents go. CRSP suing BEAM. Beam suing CRSP. Rumors that CRSP will be suing SGMO. Myself, and many others on yahoo message boards, have been pulling our hairs. What’s actually going on and who has proprietorship over what exactly? And if we are wondering who has the legal ball, I have to imagine that large firms are hesitant to invest until the air is cleared"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I think you could try to in theory but there are just too many interactions and unforeseen forces that alter things in a cell. For example I believe it’s something like 70% of genes are not actually transcribed, so therefore they don’t even function in a cell, the 30% is what matters so if there’s a difference outside of that or even inside of the 30% it may not matter, there are just too many variables"

03/17/2021,stocks,"I haven’t heard of gene therapy being used on unborn babies. Right now the study of focus is on therapies that would cure life-debilitating diseases caused by point mutations. These are cases where the DNA code has less than 5 base pairs of damage. The therapy are proteins that replace the broken strands with the correct base pairs. In the case of Beam, they’ve created the protein that will fix the mutation that causes sickle cell disease. The caveat? They’ve only done it in mice, and they don’t have a delivery system, ie how to get the drug to the mutation. 

Male pattern baldness is probably 15-20 years out, since now you need to fix multiple different spots of the DNA. Designer babies are science fiction at this point. Even if you could do it, how would you cross the placental barrier? How would you even get FDA approval? And lastly, if you could do it, should you? I don’t think it’ll happen in my life time, and I’m 30.

2021-03-17 04:27:19,stocks,"Secondary Offerings - a good time to buy? Recently, one strategy that's been interesting me is looking for biggest losers at the end of day to shop for value stocks. I've seen that typically stocks will dive in price when they announce secondary offerings. Is this typically a good time to buy at lower prices? Or are secondary offerings a sign that a company is hard up for cash, and probably doing poorly?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"One issue is that most of the companies in the biggest losers for a day tend to be obscure, unprofitable, flaming balls of fire staving off bankruptcy. Sure most of the good ones (if you can manage to find them in that stack which is heavily reduced in good ones) will eventually come up after a typically sizable wait, but you would be missing out on gains from opportunity costs because you could've just invested in something else which isn't mid crisis and waited for that crashed stock to finish cooling off so that you can get gains in the meantime.

Secondary offerings with new shares dilute the value of current shareholders, which is always bad in the immediate sense, but can be good longterm, there are also offerings in which the company sells it's owned shares without making new shares, this doesn't dilute shares and has more of a neutral effect on the stock value."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It depends on the stock.

A secondary offering could be a sign that a company is hard up for cash, and often is. But they can also be to fund new initiatives, growth or acquisitions. 

If a stock really is tanking after an offering, that's usually a sign it's the former, not the latter."
03/17/2021,stocks,"There are many reasons why a company may issue secondary offerings, typically; it's to raise capital to pay debt, a shareholder recommendation, appear more attractive. 

Whether or not the issuance is a good buy signal depends on a few key variables; if it's a small cap and (or) an early growth stock, whether the issuance is dilutive or non-dilutive, and the extent of dilution."
03/17/2021,stocks,Good question! The key is to make sure the secondary offering is not diluting shareholder interest by adding more new shares into the picture.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Some companies have to do this, but the impact is pretty measurable. REITs do this a lot out of necessity, but it usually isn't a bad thing since they can't retain much income (and can offer very decent total returns over time).

03/17/2021,stocks,"That’s rough, and reading the press release reveals that none of that money is going to the company, which makes it worse. At least when a company offers more equity, they raise money that may boost its operations. But here, it looks like a pre-IPO investor is selling out big. They may have been someone who invested early on who has made a boatload with the IPO and is cashing out. 

This is a big risk with IPOs. Most will come with a lockup period (usually 180 days) where original investors can’t sell for a certain number of days. Then that date hits and there’s a lot of profit taking, the shares hit the open market and the stock takes a nosedive. Even worse is when stock options are involved. 

You may be able to anticipate all this by reading a company’s EDGAR filings with the SEC—though it’s dense material. Or simply try to wait out the 180 days before buying into any IPO."

That depends on your target time frame and the company’s outlook.

Or, you may feel that ARKK is likely to perform better in the near term, and believe that CRSP is unlikely to break out imminently or ever. In the first case, you would likely hold. In the second, you might back out of CRSP and into a different position.

2021-03-17 04:06:31,stocks,"ARK Trading Strategies As a subscriber to ARK's daily trade updates, I've been curious to watch how she trades around the volatility over the past few months.  Cathie has stated on several occasions that she uses large cap stocks as ""cash-like instruments"" and rotates into them when her conviction plays get frothy (thus expanding her total population of stocks).  When the market drops, she consolidates and concentrates the portfolio back into her high-conviction names.  I've also noticed some other interesting trades that she has made recently that piqued my interest:

**ROKU:**  ARKW bought ROKU on 3/8 (daily range $325-356), then turned around and sold ROKU from the same fund on 3/15 (daily range $354-363).  If bought at the absolute low and sold at the absolute high on those days, that would be a 12% gain.  Great return over 1 week, but if she had enough conviction to buy at $325, why sell so quickly?  

**HIMS:**  ARKG bought HIMS on 1/27 (daily range $13.00-14.40), then sold on 2/23 (daily range $14.90-17.63) when the market began to panic.  This is particularly interesting because the fund was initiating a new position in a company.  I would expect if they bought into a new company that there was some underlying thesis that should have remained intact even after a 10-20% upward move.  Interestingly, she has continued to sell out of this ticker completely.  

These are two very different examples.  

ROKU, like Tesla, is a staple of the portfolio and another strategy she uses is trading around these types of names (ARK has made lots of money trading Tesla).  Since this is a mature investment in the portfolio, she seems to have a designated percent of the portfolio she wants to allocated to it.  When the market drops 10%, she buys more to keep that percentage intact.  When it recovers, she sells off what she bought again maintaining the base percentage.  And on and on, making nice trading profits on high-conviction plays that she wants to keep at a set percentage in the fund.  She can always change that set percentage if she has more conviction in the company by letting it appreciate without selling or simply buying more.  I think this is a valuable strategy to use for high-conviction investments that you have built to a comfortable percentage of your portfolio.  

HIMS on the other hand is a small and new add to the portfolio.  I find it interesting and odd to see her buy into something completely new and then lose conviction within weeks.  Around the same time she bought HIMS, she also bought BFLY.  While she sold out of HIMS during the downturn, she gobbled up more BFLY during the same period.  This is what I would expect a fund would do when a new investment they just made goes on sale.  But while she bought more BFLY, she sold out of HIMS.  I'm curious if others have found ARK trading around small/new positions frequently (i.e. entering and exiting them completely) or if these types of transactions should be viewed as a more significant change in sentiment toward the underlying company.  

Disclosure: I own shares of ARKK, ROKU, HIMS, BFLY  (hence why I follow all of them)."

c.) Simpler (and prop. more true): 10-20% win in a week? Hell ya. We will come back to this stock after the sell-off"
03/17/2021,stocks,"ARKs charter also says that they have to be 100% invested at all times.  

So they need to store cash in large names and they have to sell something to buy something.  Their trading rules are substantially different from ours."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Great post. I’ve wondered the same.  She’s a scalper, gets bored with the play and frees up the money for something more attractive."
03/17/2021,stocks,"The 10% thing is a maximum that I bet she would exceed if she were allowed to, but I think there's a rule about it she has to follow. I would also assume that stocks bought in late January were not fully defensive plays just yet. It seems like a low conviction addition that they might watch until the conditions improve. As for ROKU, I'm not convinced that's central to any thesis. I seems like a cash-like stock to me."
03/17/2021,stocks,its an actively managed fund...lol
03/17/2021,stocks,And sold more HIMS (albeit only 4 shares).
03/17/2021,stocks,I’m so balls deep in BFLY
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don’t follow her trades as in buy what she buys, but I follow what she’s trading out of interest.  She was definitely rebalancing when she sold ROKU in early January and then bought back in during the interest rate fits.  She loves to trade around that stock and I think it’s a valuable strategy for high conviction plays in anyone’s portfolio as I described.  HIMS was not rebalancing, since it was such a tiny fraction of the portfolio and a very small absolute gain.  I just find it interesting how differently she reacted to HIMS and BFLY.  

I will note that it’s a little concerning that she can buy a small cap stock, it jumps 20% on her buy, and she can sell out of it.  Not suggesting that was the strategy here (she would have sold it in the 20’s if that were), but people should be aware that when she buys a stock they shouldn’t necessarily view that as a strong conviction play."
03/17/2021,stocks,It may work now but won't in virtually any other market
03/17/2021,stocks,"I believe you are correct on the 10% rule. Warren Buffets BRK.B fund has run into this before, most recently with an airline i think? 

Without a quick google, I'm fairly certain owning more than 10% puts you into some SEC violation."
03/17/2021,stocks,Agreed. And that’s a concern for the long term of Arkk IMO.
03/17/2021,stocks,I'm not sure she can outperform the S&P in a span of 20-30 years.
03/17/2021,stocks,I would guess that she would not. I wouldn’t want to stay in ARKK for long term
2021-03-17 03:59:34,stocks,"What will earnings look like for BB, and what will it do to the stock price? Curious to what you all think will happen to BB this upcoming earnings report. They have a slew of new partnerships, but unlikely to affect its earnings. The Facebook settlement will (probably) be less than expected.

I think the company is gearing up to head upwards in the long run. They just rebranded their website and now finally marketing themselves as cybersecurity. Hopefully this dissociates them from the old phone making days.

With all that said, its still \~6 billion market cap. Lots of potential with IVY. There are other hyped stocks that trade like 50-100x their earnings, so why can't BB? Do you think this quarterly earnings will give them a leg up into the $15-$20 range?

My position: 5,285 shares @ $11.85"

03/17/2021,stocks,"Once they can show consistent growth it'll go up which I believe is just a matter of time.

Also their guidance has to have a good outlook."
03/17/2021,stocks,"My wild guess is that earnings will be at 240M w/o FB settlement and 290M (if they're playing quarterly as a subscription-based licensing fee) with the FB settlement, all the way as high as 450M depending on the payout.

03/17/2021,stocks,God please let me.out ..holding at $17.50 coming down from meme Hype fomo..BB is a great company but I share the sentiment of the fellows here..
03/17/2021,stocks,"Earnings will probably be like all the others they have had. They are still bleeding money but rearanging the focus of the business.

Red day coming in my opinion, when alot of potentialy new investors sees that there is no profit in the company, and holding for gains is minimum 2-5 years i excpect people to dump it and move on.

Potentially If this happends i might pick up some shares If it dips alot."
03/17/2021,stocks,It will most likely be Burgundy. I mean the wine I'll be drinking due to the constant red I see everyday on BB.
03/17/2021,stocks,When are earnings being released?
03/17/2021,stocks,I was going to buy extra shares of BB but I saved some cash just in case they dipped after earnings to average down
03/17/2021,stocks,Rangebound $10-$15. My strategy is simple: covered calls every week.
03/17/2021,stocks,Gonna sell calls when IV goes up I have 300 shares at $13.50 avg
03/17/2021,stocks,Stock can only go up from here.
03/17/2021,stocks,Well using the info I gathered from comments about BB any good news brings the stocks down and bad news brings it down so I predict it will go down
03/17/2021,stocks,When will the earnings be released?
03/17/2021,stocks,"They aren’t priced that expensive compared to many other high flying stocks out there, unless their earnings miss big time, shouldn’t see too big of a movement. They were 11.5 before gme pump and now they are holding around 11. Not bad for the sector that they are in, many others seen big correction or in bear market range already."

03/17/2021,stocks,Like dude I believe in the company but i haven’t touched it since the short squeeze hype it’s just too irrational

My E*TRADE account is showing a day’s gain and market value. Is that for if I want to buy my own contract back? If I do nothing I just get $9 right?

2021-03-17 03:23:11,stocks,"Tips for helping when to sell a stock. So, I've very recently started investing (been actively following the market since about august and after in hindsight sitting at the sidelines way too long started in late december). So far my portfolio is up about 5 percent, however recently there have been 2 opportunities where I could have sold a stock at a much higher price after it went up insane amounts in 1 day. 

These particular instances were $RKT (owned shares at 20.90) which went up to 43$ and $CHEK (owned shares at 1.70) which went up 180 percent in 1 day from 1.53$ to 4.30$. I didn't sell my shares in either of these instances (let's be honest I got greedy) and both have significantly dropped since (still up on both positions). 

My question is how do you guys deal with situations like this? When do you take profits? If I had sold off my shares in both instances I could have been up about 20 percent in total. I am aware thinking why didn't I get out at the top in hindsight is a toxic mindset but I am looking to improve my abilities as an investor so therefore I am here asking you kind people for advice. Thanks in advance :)"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I bought AMD at $14 and sold at $28 a couple years ago because I felt like doubling my money was incredible. Sometimes you just make the wrong decision (short or long term) but at the end of the day you made money instead of losing it

Edit: for some context. When I sold AMD it crashed back to $17 shortly after. It took almost a year to get back to $28. But then it shot up to over $70 and is over $80 today. Point being is I made out strong in a 2 year window, but missed out on major gains in a 4 year window. At the time I thought I caught the peak, but a couple years later it quadrupled. Timing is very very hard"
03/17/2021,stocks,"If you are trading then have a price in mind and set triggers to sell. 

If you are investing, sell when the investment no longer makes sense in your portfolio."
03/17/2021,stocks,"A lesson I learned the hard way (many, many, maaaany times to be honest) don't be greedy.

Set price targets based on your DD and cash out when they hit and be happy with the profit. That's what I tell my friends who basically only bought GME and get greedier by the day. 

With big gains like that 180÷ you can take out your investment and have fun with your ""free"" shares. If it works great, if it doesn't at least you can learn from it."
03/17/2021,stocks,"If you’re gains are good enough to screenshot or brag about, then it’s time to sell. If you get that ecstatic “fuck yeah” feeling, it’s time to sell. Those are my rules."
03/17/2021,stocks,"its true when you get really excited when it jumps you should sell it.alot of times when a stock rockets we go into a dream like state thinking about what if it hits $6 $8  or i read it might hit $10 today and then we get really greedy. dont listen to these people that say its going to hit this amount by the end of the day because they dont know. thats what happen with CHEK,when it hit $4.40 inside i was thinking sell sell but then it was like a fairytale believing it would keep rising.i finally sold everything when it was $3.60 and i am glad i did. i almost waited longer thinking that it would rise back up over $4 but it never did.takes your profits no matter how big or small and feel good about it. you made money at the push of a button"
03/17/2021,stocks,"For what it's worth, people with quite a lot of experience in the market were watching RKT closely and still didn't cash out. Don't be too hard on yourself for not selling at the top. Instead be happy that you correctly found a stock that had the upside that it did. That's better than many people can claim.

As far as advice goes: buy stocks that you don't expect to sell for at least a year. After holding for over a year you only get hit with long-term capital gains tax, which is much cheaper than short term taxes. If you sell a stock after every bump, you might miss out on much larger gains in the future (and you get hit with higher taxes on your gains.)

For example, I sold my TSLA (after holding for years) at the top of the market a year ago at a 3x gain (\~$170 per share). Not bad, but if I had ridden out the dip for another 12 months I would have made at least an additional 4x on top of that."

I know this doesn't answer your question but I fall squarely in the camp of long term investor that invests money that I don't plan on seeing in a long time.

03/17/2021,stocks,You need to have a game plan before buying. Are you in long term or short term? Two very different things. If short term have a plan on what you are looking to get out of it. When you get there sell. You should know when you’re going to sell before you even buy it.
03/17/2021,stocks,"To reiterate on what others are saying, know what you are buying and what your plan is for it.  Have a better catalyst to buy other than emojis, and a more realistic price target other than random space landmarks."
03/17/2021,stocks,Why did you buy the stock? Because you felt it would be a profitable company and go up for years to come? If you still feel that way hold it regardless of whether it has spiked. Did you buy because you felt the market had undervalued it and now you think the price increase reflects its true value. Maybe it's time to sell. Do you want to invest in something you feel is more profitable and need more capital? Maybe it's time to think about locking in some of your gains.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Set a target and pull out initial investment, let the free shares ride.  If it hits 200-300% in short period, I'll pull of original + 20% and will dump the 20 into more conservative investments in case I need it for taxes later on."

03/17/2021,stocks,"Risk tolerance and FOMO is difficult to manage sometimes. Helps to reason out and set yourself loss tolerance and gain goal and stick with it unless something significant in the world happens. Don't think of one big trade, but a series of many good trades. 10% gain is doing good so sell, 20% you're doing great so sell. Anything above that consider it luck and sell. If it goes higher after you sell don't regret, keep in mind what your goal was and that you achieved it and you're trying to make gains in the long run and not through luck. If you reinvest with 10% gain 3 times you're actually up 33% due to compounding interest. If you do it 8 times you've more than doubled your investment. Don't forget even with DD and fundamentals and even pop culture/trend pushing the stock along, one significant bad news and it'll drop. Just imagine what would happen to $TSLA if Elon died or became severely ill, or $COKE if news came out lead somehow got in millions of shipments. Happened to me with $EBIX. Only lost a bit due to stop loss, but I was beating myself over not selling earlier when I had clear gains."

03/17/2021,stocks,Yeah I found myself in the exact same situation with CHEK haha. I'll just hold till the results of the pivotal study now atleast to hopefully see that 4$ again in the future.

It's just annoying to see them both shoot up like this and come crashing down immediately with me just watching it happen. If I had sold both I probably would have bought back in at a later point anyway (providing they went down)

Edit: also I dont have to worry about capital gains since im not from the US (actually where I live you only pay a 1.2% wealth tax for any amount over 50.000 euro (so 60k$). Which im not near yet.)"
03/17/2021,stocks,I read your comment in a British accent.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I mean I bought rocket well before the reddit hype and Chek went up on FDA approval news. I agree that both might have been somewhat riskier investments (although looking at rocket's financials an entrypoint of 20.90$ seems like a bargain to me but w/e). Thing is, neither of these stocks were bought with the intention of them shooting up a 100 percent they just did."
03/17/2021,stocks,"If something blows up to an all time high over the course of a day without an insane catalyst then you may as well secure gains. Whether you bought it the day before or 3 watched it trade sideways for 3 months beforehand you're still getting hit with short term gains tax from a sale.

I often hold some speculative biotech stocks that are risky long term approval plays and will trade sideways until they explode or eat shit. It's not all that uncommon for one to double or triple its normal value over the course of the day with no substantial catalyst, so I sell. Assuming I still like the stock, I'll still like it 2 days later when it returns to its normal price and I can re-enter a position."
03/17/2021,stocks,I think Rocket has a much higher upside in the long-term... There's the possibility that you would have took your winnings on RKT and put them in a losing bet anyways.
03/17/2021,stocks,"That is wise to wait for the correction, then reevaluate a new position entirely."
03/17/2021,stocks,Most likely would have cashed out on rocket and bought back in later for that nice dividend

03/17/2021,stocks,"When you're young, you have all the time in the world (and the long side of compounding interest) and can trade that for money.

When you're older, you will be exchanging the money for time.  Whether it's medicine to save your life, or tools to save you time.

Your time currently is worth very little.  Not many people are going to pay an 18 year old $20/hour and for the cost of an engineer or manager, $100/hour.  Later on, that will translate into a lawyer or medical doctor.

The highest growth (right now) is to learn a skill / trade that will pay you back in spades later on in life.  Whether that's going to college, starting a business, or learning how to make your money, make you money.

You want a recipe?  How much work do you want to put in (e.g. buying the ingredients in the store, or baking your own bread to make a samwich?)

* Best shot now at large amounts of wealth is to start a small business.  You can provide a service (check out your local craigslist for ""labor"") for people who are in that later phase of exchanging money for time
* Go to school and pursue a career that makes you happy (that's key) and money.  Don't go into medicine unless you're going to work for pharma.  Avoid finance.  Even joining the military can pay you back later on, presuming you take it seriously
* Got a few bucks?  Understand the rule of 72, compounding interest and index funds.  

So the key here is

* How much risk are you willing to take?
* How much time/energy do you want to invest?
* How long is your investment threshold?"

In order to do this they target disruptive innovations as those stand to yield the highest profits. I’d recommend listening to some of the videos on their YouTube if you want to get an idea of what cathy’s vision is for the future.

But don’t be afraid to put some in a safer index too. You’re young enough that the exponential growth can really have an impact. It might seem boring now but 15 years down the road you won’t regret much"
03/17/2021,stocks,QQQJ and QQQM. Do this consistently and you'll be a millionaire before age 35.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Not gonna be boring and will answer your exact question, basically you are asking how to be ahead of the market, and if we could answer this we all be rich.

Id start by watching how other ppl that broke the market made their first million, there is a nice one about Warren Buffet on yt. 

Small cap is definitely the way to go imo, options are too much of a zero sum game. There is a fine balance to find between growth and value, but basically what your are looking for is informations that aren’t priced in yet. This is where a solid grasp of accounting and fundamentals are important, because it can gives you metrics on how to price information you find that the general market isn’t aware, again there is less competition in small caps and its easier to find value in NRs and other analysts work. Being gullible is costly with small cap, everyone has the next revolutionary product, the only sure this is: **money talk**

look for contracts with other reliable companies or governments, unrealized but realistic backlog,  current assets value vs market cap, etc... once you went throught 100+ of companies in good sectors, you will fall in love eventually, thats the hard and beautiful part, hoping you found the right one, its time to take risk.

Now is the time to get married, you are almost certain you are early/ the market is late. You need to commit, like they say: concentrate to get rich and diversify to stay it. You can manage 2 or 3 wifes but more than that and itll be too hard to manage, remember you are married, you are committed, you have conviction , divorcing will cost you half your home so be ready to wait years before saying you were wrong, coz you weren’t, the rest of the market is, you know there is something not being priced in, now you need other ppl to know it too, share your discovery like you would share your wife lmao, with ppl that will respect her while telling her story.

All that needs lots of work and mostly lots of luck, you might be in a failed mariage and in this case you did a terrible mistake that will cost you years of you time(money), or you could have a widly successful wife that becomes the next korean pop star or something, that makes ppl ask you of the hell did a guy like you ended with that! And your answer should be she just needed a bit of love and some confidence while finishing her makeup. 


Hope this dont sound too stupid lmao, still lore reliable than yoloing in call options in the next tesla. At least if you lose everything with wifey, you learned a lot during the way, you didn’t just bought a lottery ticket, you bought education. And Hopefully after a little break you can go back on tinder until you know you found the next woman you want to share your life with.

TLDR read the intelligent investor, learn the rudiments of accounting(balance sheets, earning and such), find information that is not priced in the markets, be ready for grey hair caused by stress. Move in and out of positions by increments, have high conviction, dont be too much of an idiot (a lil bit of one aint that bad either) and always, always be an ultra cheap fuck, there is no way youll get five bagger+ without being super cheap while buying.  There is always some discounts on the market good luck finding them!

Ps my english aint the best, see in my profile what a small cap DD could looks like and dont hesitate to hit me in DM for more information or questions!"

03/17/2021,stocks,Why?
03/17/2021,stocks,I've not looked into small cap ETFs before. Are they worth having alongside the large caps? I don't mind taking a bit more risk.
03/17/2021,stocks,"QQQJ and QQQM are highcap/mid cap(respectively) ETFs that track the NASDAQ. So it’s basically an ETF of blue chip tech stocks, which have had a strong and stable growth."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I was just reading a morning star report on a small cap fund today and they say ""Small-cap stocks tend to be riskier and less profitable than their larger counterparts, so this portfolio will likely be more volatile than most large cap portfolios."" I think it is worth having some small cap in your portfolio. I was looking at SCHA, but IJR, VIOO and VTWO are other options that meet my criteria of a low expense ratio. The performance of each of these is nearly identical over 1, 3, 5 and 10 yr returns but that is because these all do the same thing. They are not specific to a sector."
2021-03-17 03:05:33,stocks,"RKT Triple Witching 3/19 **Hello friends,**

In the past few weeks I was have been trying to get positioned into RKT. I have been eyeing this thing for months and finally was able to grab a position today after all the chaos the past few weeks.

Well lets dive deep into some analysis why this could be huge short term and long term.

In the short term I see a lot of upside potential with 100% return or more if we can trigger the gamma squeeze this Friday 3/19 which is very possible with all the indicators I will cover in this post.

Short Interest is up:

Todays Volume was a bit lower than the Daily Average: **15M Volume**

The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.

RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT)

**Shorts still in the game:**

As of March 13th 20.8M shares are still short, representing $537,000,000, 6% fee.

During the mini-squeeze only about 1/3 of shorts left, and many re-shorted (data convoluted on this and you know how easy it is for them to 'opps under report').

Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).

So the float is about 100 million shares making it 2-2.5 billion. However the company is 50 billion

In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.

Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.

DTCC Rule

**Housing data comes out March 17th:**

This will show what we all already know, housing market is on FIRE.

1. Housing prices are rising: This motivates new construction, home renovations and people to sell at a profit.
2. Employment is strengthening.
3. Economy is re-bounding.
4. Work From Home: people want more space, are migrating from cities and condos to houses in the suburbs.
5. Low rates continue.

**Open Call Options:**

Look at the open call options of RKT for Friday March 19th, 49,856 contracts at $28.89!!! We are currently at $26.44!!! If we hit that strike by Friday, we could have a huge Gamma Squeeze which would lead to other short squeezes on higher strike prices as well, at the same day!

RKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers.

**Stimulus + Triple Witching:**

Stimulus checks hit the banks **March 17th.** This is a major catalyst for the entire market as a whole but the trending stocks on reddit will accumulate a good portion of those stimulus checks IMO.

Triple witching:

The housing market is absolutely on fire and if you click all these links.... GL lol but it shows we are MOONING and so is the Housing market.

What does this mean for ROCKET?! Well it indicates that Rocket is a healthy safe stock to be invested in long term. The current price is such a fire sale it isn't even comparable to what we will see in 5-10 years from now.

Inflation is about to take place and we may see 5-10% increase in the housing market rapidly and we have no control of this.

This is Bullish for Rocket and thats why I will be holding Rocket Long term.

**TLDR:**

**RKT is going to Gamma squeeze if we break $29.00 and 3/19 triple witching will push the price past previous highs.**

**RKT is a great short term and long term play.**

**RKT catalysts, Stimulus, Open Calls, Housing Data March 17th, Short interest 35%, and Triple witching 3/19.**

03/17/2021,stocks,"I like RKT long term and don't care about your timing, and think the whole mortgage market is undervalued. Good high quality high credit mortgages with large down payments are pushing prices up. I'm in a hot market, not the hottest but decent, and every house we see gets 25+ offers. Good ones bad ones doesn't matter. Every thing is above list."
03/17/2021,stocks,I like this stock but you dont have the volume to support it. The daily Level 2 is nothing but sadness. I have said this before when GME was driving down to $50 :” you need whales in this game to create volatility”
03/17/2021,stocks,I hope 🤞 you’re on to something. Several more posts on WSB on this but same goes for UWMC. I think quad witching is creating the same buzz for a lot of stocks.
03/17/2021,stocks,I like the stock standalone based on long term fundamentals. Short term squeeze potential is just icing on the cake.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Sigh, this is getting desperate, expire either <=25.88 or if more bearish <=23.88. Majority of open interest blocks are going \*POOF\*. Triple witching just makes it triply so.

03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm long but only because I haven't figured out what my exit strategy is. I don't see a long term future for RKT. The mortgage market was bigger than it ever has been and probably ever will be in 2020. They may grow market share but revenue will dry up as soon as rates start to go up. 

The only bright spot for us current bag holders is the $1b buy back that was announced in Q3 2020 but hasn't been started yet. At this point, I don't think they ever will start buying back shares and they're only using it to scare the short sellers from taking bigger positions.

I'm very surprised you didn't mention the buy back as it's really the only reason to be bullish on the stock right now. The fact that you didn't mention it makes me think this is pretty shoddy DD."

03/17/2021,stocks,RKT imo is a good buy but i would want its price to drop a little to get a nice entry point
03/17/2021,stocks,"So listen. I had the same theory and even made a post about it.

The Problem is simple tho. Yes the float is 100million shares, however I think most call options are sold by institutions that hold shares that arent in the float. Remember there are a total of 1.9BILLION shares out there. ONLY 100 million of these are available to the public.

So what happens if the institutions holding 1,8BILLION of the available shares get assigned and the calls have to be exercised? The float gets diluted by MILLIONS of shares and the price of the stock is gonna drop by next week.

Option sellers would make billions with premiums and profit from shares.

EDIT:  
Conclusion: Gamma squeeze wont happen because institutions already have the shares."

of course, not actually expecting these to hit, which is why i set my calls that high. it's just free money while i watch the share price slowly go up, and in the event of an unexpected massive jump, i'll still collect good returns."

03/17/2021,stocks,it'll stop when all the people end up bag holders on GME.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Do you think there will be a post-COVID housing crisis? Some are thinking that many lenders who waved mortgage payments are going to drop lump sums on people's heads later this year and lead to massive defaulting. I don't know enough about the subject to really speculate one way or another, but you sound like you know what you're talking about lol.

I also like RKT long term, but got in way too high, so on one hand it's a lot of capital I'd like to free up to use elsewhere that won't just bleed money constantly, but at the same time I think it might be a decent value right now assuming the mortgage market doesn't have a crash looming."
03/17/2021,stocks,Maybe this will have a second spike like how GME had a second spike.
03/17/2021,stocks,"I rode that squeeze up and down.

03/17/2021,stocks,Originating mortgages is 88% of their revenue. What diversified business are you talking about?
03/17/2021,stocks,"RKT borrows the money they lend out for their loans. They make money on the spread between the rate they borrow to the rate they lend. 

That means they are in a volume business. They won't see higher profits from higher rates because higher rates means they're also paying higher interest on the money they're borrowing. 

Now that you know this, I want you to go look up the size of the average annual mortgage market since 2008. Then look up what it was in 2020. Then tell me whether or not you think we will ever see a mortgage market that big again as rates increase. 

Do you see where I'm going with this?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"The buy back was approved two quarters ago. At the last quarterly release, they hadn't repurchased any shares. Plus it's a $1b buy back when there's barely a $2.5b float. 

If you're going to buy back almost half the shares that you issued and you only issued public shares for 10% of the company... why even go public in the first place? 

I've been swing trading RKT between $20and $22 since it went public. I've been bearish on the company since the beginning but I bought into the hype with the special dividend and the Morgan Stanley partnership and held onto my shares instead of selling when it spiked after the annual earnings release.

Personally, I think it's a $70 company (although I don't think the market will take it there for many years) and the most bearish assumptions would price it at $34.

03/17/2021,stocks,"It's time to come home, son."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I'll continue to be an ass, thank you very much. Happily married. Tired of people like you, and it's good for you know it! Stop posting shit like this lol, this past year has been a fucking FLOOD of stupid posts like this"

2021-03-17 02:33:56,stocks,"Does anyone know ANY stock picking service that actually brings returns?? I may get roasted and people may say ""do your own research"".. The bottom line is, I don't want to.  I want to pay someone to tell me what to buy when, and then when to sell it.  Ideally a txt based service would be great, and one that isn't pumping something, but one that has an actual intelligent investor(s) that can advise based on a monthly subscription fee.. Does anyone have any recommendations on any services such as this?"

03/17/2021,stocks,"Regarding VTI, I don't see a DRIP option (Fidelity) to re-invest dividends. Is that even a thing with VTI? I see VTI as well regarded across all stock subreddits, but I thought the best index funds would provide dividends to automatically re-invest via DRIP. Any thoughts?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"There are plenty of solid mutual funds out there. 

FBGRX has a 19.2% 10 year annualized return. 

FKDNX has a 18.3% 10 year annualized

Both of those are high growth funds but you even have DODGX in the value space that has outperformed the S&P on a 20 year look back. It's a value fund and hasn't performed as well in the last 10 years as growth has been king but it should be a complement to a portfolio and not a core holding.

Shit even, AMCPX has a 12.7% and MITTX has a 12.65% on the 10 year return and those are about as vanilla you get for a mutual fund."
03/17/2021,stocks,Wow i didnt know this. Thanks! Very cool
2021-03-17 02:26:28,stocks,"VOO and VTI are already up between 6-7% YTD, are we looking at gains similar to or slightly less than last year? Hi! I'm fairly new to investing and have read on this subreddit a lot that you should expect around only 7% from S&P 500 every year. VTI is already up 6.75% and VOO 6.15% YTD. 
What does this mean? Is this overvaluation or reasonable gains?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I think it's going to be a year of high volatility. I think the this quarter was really good but we could also look at increasing sell offs in the US Bond market which underpins the stock market. I still expect the year to be just slightly above average, but the volatility will shake some of the casual investors who just started"
03/17/2021,stocks,"2 things:

1. Expecting 7% doesn't mean every year is 7%, it means that's the average over many years. It is more like... Somewhere between -15 and +30. In fact it's rarely ever exactly the average in any given year.

2. The quick recovery from last year's nosedive has inflated the % gains for the past year-ish."

To this day it still shows my rate of return for the account as -6% (it started as -29%). I put that $10k from Exxon into a small cap fund which is up 70% now, yet I still have a negative rate of return on the account. all that’s in that account are index funds. 

Like I said. My fidelity account is wonky."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Agreed - not available on app. On the website, it’s a reasonably powerful tool. If you have multiple accounts, you can specific various combinations or just single accounts to use in the performance calculation."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I need more upvotes for your comment. I was always high on TDA, and when they upgraded the app dashboard to include comparing your portfolio's performance over time against the market indexes to me is one of the best things they could have done. I love that so much, and more people need to track their performance this way. (Again, with the caveat that the more you deposit or withdraw, the less useful this comparison becomes, because they just use your overall balance total.)"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah man that's an awesome feature. Some people, they create bias real quick as soon as they read a bunch of negative comment about something. Anyway I'm liking everything about TD so far.
I've just requested a transfer from RH, hoping that would go okay. Have you tried that?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"No, I've never transferred and never had RH. TDA is my first and only. You never forget your first. ETrade and I were close, but never quite hit it off and I shied away before we hit second base."
03/17/2021,stocks,Hahah! Can we change cost basis in TD? Example: RH doesn't transfer cost basis. Can I manually do it?
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don't know what is or isn't technically possible, but regardless of what the app tracks as your cost basis, the reality in your personal bank account remains unchanged, so artificially altering CB wouldn't yield any *real* benefits, would it? I guess there's potential to artificially raise your CB to lower your tax liability, but my instinct says that's the kind of low-brow loophole tax code would have adjusted for by now. 

IMO, the closer to real life, the better, regardless of what is or isn't possible to artificially alter."
03/17/2021,stocks,Yes I understand that. My concern is having no cost basis at all upon transfer from RH. So I was wondering if I could enter it manually or ask TD to do that
03/17/2021,stocks,Whoa. No CB at all? You just gave me a migraine. Why would that be possible?!
03/17/2021,stocks,"No CB of the RH shares you transferred not the ones you buy through TD. It's just a fuck up from RH.

I wish they provided checks as well as a debit card, but again, not a deal breaker.

I opened a Fidelity account, which I have yet to fund because I want to deposit cash and move gradually to using it (if I do at all) rather than tying up my investments while transferring them. I do not have any experience with Fidelity and really just opened the account based on comments I have read here on reddit. One thing I have found is that with Fidelity you are able to list beneficiaries.

I would appreciate input and suggestions from more experienced traders. I am sure this comparison is not as simple as I think it is.

I am also considering using my brokerage account for my day to day banking. I realize I would have to be careful to avoid getting into margin unless it was for something very important, but I also see margin as a way to access low interest cash instead of using credit cards. Dumb or smart?

Fractional shares. I can jump on board a.stock that has a high tag and get in on the action.

If I sell XYZ tomorrow 3/17 will i be able to claim the current loss that has accumulated since 2/12 if I do not repurchase the stock again for minimum 30 days after 3/17 (so lets say 4/18, is the soonest I could repurchase the stock again)?

I watched the video on the fidelity website and it says the 1st wash sale value was added to my cost basis thus the blue ""W"" on my ticker. It has been over 30 days but the blue ""W"" is still there, it might remain as a historical tracker until the value of the stock goes above the cost basis, but my main concern is that I will not be able to claim the current loss due to multiple swing trades in January and February before I held the stock for 30 days from 2/12 - 3/17.

PLUG power down hard after hours due to news that there are some small accounting errors. I believe this is a great buy in and been meaning to release some DD on it that it is a very underrated stock. Why? They're a legit company and the better of the fuel cell stocks (FuelCell for example which was waay overpriced) with contracts in Europe and Korea.

\- Korea recently invested in them at **30$ a share**. Should be a floor.

\- Energy pull back recent weeks. This is easily a 100$ stock by next year end

\- Partnerships with Amazon, Walmart, Nike, Home Depot, etc. Their battery product is real it's already being used on forklifts. The question is when it'll be moved to more products.

\- Legit company, not like Nikola. Their glassdoor even has a hiring *SURGE*:

Importantly, there is no expected impact to our cash position, business operations or economics of commercial arrangements***. We continue to execute on our mission to provide customers with state-of-the-art fuel cell and green hydrogen solutions. We remain confident in our ability to leverage our strong business momentum and market leading technologies, independently and alongside our joint venture partners, to capture the significant business opportunities in this rapidly growing industry.”"

03/17/2021,stocks,Took a huge loss on PLUG. Bought high 50s and doubled down at 30s. But this is bad news. Markets not going to give them the benefit of the doubt. I’ll buy them back in once it craters to catch a bounce back and get some money backc
03/17/2021,stocks,damn I literally bought 40 shares today..
03/17/2021,stocks,I’m long on Plug.  I admittedly bought some near the peak.  But I also have some from last time it was in the 30s.  Picked up a few more shares in after hours today.  I think it will go back up soon.  But I’m not really sweating the short term.  I’m not looking to sell for about 3 years unless something fundamental changes.

CONs:
I did take a look at the level of debt this company has, and wouldn’t ignore it. There is a 50$ fee to buy the stock on some platforms, others (like Robinhood) might hide that fee.

You cannot put certain calls on this probably due to liquidity (not sure, you tell me).

Note* Trading volumes are high enough that you won’t get trapped should it continue to drop. (But you already knew that).

Note* RR has gone through bankruptcy before, even that hasn’t stopped it. Should it go to that extreme again, it might rebound all the same.

PROs:
Over the next year it should see a LARGE boost in stock price along with the return to travel culture, if not large, than significant, but I have no crystal ball, however my sentiment is shared by many regarding the aviation future.

The have announced exploration avenues and R&D projects that are in the pipeline.

They have a great brand and can leverage other sectors besides aviation to keep them going.

OVERALL:
RR comes with risk, but seems like it could be one of the huge rewards out there for the taking in later 2022. it seems positioned to easily 4x. If there is a time to buy it is today or the last few weeks. Let me know what you think, how is your risk assessment? Why would or wouldn’t you pick up RR."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I work for a company that manufactures parts for RR, GE, and other airplane/aerospace companies. We’re bracing for a major uptick when restrictions are lifted. One of the things many people don’t realize about airplanes and their engines, is the amount of maintenance that goes into them. Every XX hours the engines need to be rebuilt, essentially. Add to that all of these planes that have been mothballed for COVID are going to need tune-ups etc before they can start flying again, and companies like RR are going to be busier than ever trying to get planes back in the sky to meet demand. They’re already starting to try and get ahead, but when the flood gates open it going to be difficult for the industry to keep up (they expect).


Tl;dr  buy Rolls Royce and any other travel related companies if they haven’t shown major improvements yet. The post COVID wave is coming."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Noob here. I'm in the US, is it RYCEY? RR.L? RRLCF? 

Like why is there so many?"
03/17/2021,stocks,I think RYCEY is a legitimate recovery play. I have a price target around $3 which would put it at pre-covid levels (adjusted for the share dilution). There are risks if COVID hangs around longer and longer.
03/17/2021,stocks,How do you see that $50 fee?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Damn, I can't even buy this on Merrill. Hard to believe there are established brokers that don't offer OTC stocks."

03/17/2021,stocks,"Honestly this is prolly the lowest you’ll ever see it’s stock price unless it goes bankrupt. Between going into covid with a high (not unworkable, but definitely a lot) of debt, got fucked by covid, had a scheduled stock split back in October, and had a special dividend paid back in December you have the perfect storm to lower an airplane engine builder who’s main source of income comes from the mileage flown on its engines, to these all time lows. Once it crosses $2 it’s not coming back down save for another world wide reset on covid. Hell I don’t see it hitting 1.60 agin personally."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Your broker should tell you one way or the other, maybe fine print, or if they don’t tell you than it’s hidden or magically not existent, due to buy channel."

03/17/2021,stocks,are you talking about RR?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Nice! Good to know, thanks."
03/17/2021,stocks,I think this can hit $3 max months down the line. Not sure if it's worth it at this point.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Just doubled my position :D

Edit: lmao money go brrr"
03/17/2021,stocks,"RYCEY, am American and none of my brokerages have RR.L"
03/17/2021,stocks,"$13 to $18 is not realistic. I’m a big RYCEY booster, but I think $3 is a realistic target. That would put it at its pre-pandemic market cap. More upside is possible if partnerships, r&d they’ve done puts them in more growth businesses, but that’s years down the line. Do no expect this to moon beyond 3x in the medium term."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Ah thank you. I was looking at it a month or two ago. I understand rolls royce getting back to the same levels it was pre covid, but why do people think it will go higher? When the company is fully in the mud."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I believe RR.L is reserved for the English stock market, Everyone else has to go through a go-around, so that’s where the other stock tickers come into play. But if someone wants to elaborate further, you get the tip-of-the-hat."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Do me a favor and go back and look at what it was trading for back in Jan and Feb of 2020. It was between $8-$9. That’s it’s prepandemic level, not $3. 

The reason it got so low was a perfect shit storm that hit RR. It had massive debt going into covid, its revenue stream is extra susceptible to grounded flights as they aren’t making mileage fees or servicing engines when no planes are flying, had a scheduled stock split (I wanna say it was a 1:4 split) in October that further lowered the price (which is calculated into charts already so that previous $8-$9 range for precovid still stands) and that was all topped off by a special dividend that the company paid its shareholders in December to further crash the stock price. During covid it has used this down period to trim its fat, cut debt, and shit down money sinks as well as secure future contracts by capitalizing on its competitors failures (like its biggest competitor having two engines fail in two separate planes in two separate countries, 1 caught on fire even). Overall $8-$9 is the expected return post covid, $13-$18 is growth once revenue returns in 2023+ and they begin to make money again."
03/17/2021,stocks,"The company isn’t fully in the mud at all, especially if you listen to their recent ER call. They are shedding debt and debt makers left and right while focusing on what they do best. Making engines and focusing on making them the best they can. 

As far as it returning to its precovid levels, that would still mean it’ll go back to $8-$9 per share. But during this pandemic, as stated above, they have been just unloading debt left and right. So much so that they are expecting to be actually earning a profit by 2023, something they weren’t even doing precovid. Additionally they have a strong R&D division looking towards electric and nuclear powered engines. But to return to your question about why rising above their covid levels, I’m expecting a huge airline boom for the next two years minimum. And with RR’s biggest competitor just having 2 engine malfunctions (on separate planes, no one was hurt) where one burst into flames mid flight. They also make money off of the miles flown on the engines they sell, which is just an amazing revenue stream imo, others might do it but idk.

Also they are the GE of England. They make the engines for not only all of England’s fleet of ships and planes but also has contracts with several other European countries to build, power and service their fleets."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah I get why I can’t get it. I’m using RYCEY which is an ADR offered through J.P. Morgan. There’s also RLLCF (Rolls C shares, how RR pays dividends in England only), RYCEF (this is a F share, basically it’s RR but in American dollars not pounds), and there used to be RYCRF (this is the older version of RYCEF, still an F share, but discontinued)."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Why do you act like you know what you’re talking about and insult people who actually do?

You need to look at market cap, not price. The stock did NOT split. They offered a ton more shares to raise money, diluting the stock considerably (I sold off a large portion prior to this for a gain, before buying back in—RYCEY shareholders did not qualify for the dividend). So you simply cannot compare the price before to the price after—there are a lot more shares at a lower valuation. 

I am bullish on this stock, but at $13, this would be a 108 billion dollar company—more than 4 times what they were worth prior to Covid."
03/17/2021,stocks,Is RYCEY or RYCEF the better play for a U.S. investor? RYCEF seems slightly cheaper?
03/17/2021,stocks,"1) I never insulted you, grow tf up (that barely counts)

2)RYCEY follows and tracks the movement of RR.L in London, while holders didn’t get the special dividend their share price still changed to reflect the fact that one was paid. 

3) RR.L split in October, RYCEY (which again, isn’t RR.L but rather an ADR stock that is managed by J.P. Morgan) as a result had to add shares that ended up diluting the total number lowering it to what we see today. 

4) all prices you see currently on the charts going back to precovid have all the dilution and everything allready accounted for, you can see it was above $8 in Jan and Feb of 2020. 

Finally your argument that it would have to trade at 4 times what it’s worth precovid assumes it would trade at a P/E ratio of 1. Since it’s mostly compared to GE let’s see what GE’s P/E is at... 314.5 so yeah I would say RYCEY’s current P/E ratio of 1.4 has enough room to grow to 5 or 6 to get to those price targets of $13-$18."
03/17/2021,stocks,"If you have access to RRCEF I would buy RRCEF as that is RR but just converted to freedom bucks. Some brokerages don’t offer it and only offer RYCEY, such as RobinHood. 

Best way to describe it would be like this:

With RYCEY I’m buying through a middleman (JP Morgan) but with RYCEF I’m buying RR just in USD so I go to have to worry about currency exchange rates, and I can do this because my broker is able to trade on the London Stock Exchange and just does the conversions for me on the back end."
03/17/2021,stocks,"RR did not have a stock split. Again, they offered additional shares. You had to pay for them. There is a difference. 

You can find market cap with a simple calculator. Number of shares outstanding times stock price. Rolls Royce is not a 100+ billion dollar company. It wasn’t pre covid. I’m pretty sure it never was. You think now, after all the shit they’ve gone through, is the time they’ll be worth the most? Grow up?

Edit: Here's the market cap history: https://companiesmarketcap.com/rolls-royce-holdings/marketcap/

You may be confused because basic stock charts typically adjust for stock splits, but they do not adjust for dilution."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Currency exchange rates seem tricky to me for stocks. With inflation rising and the U.S. dollar potentially weakening, wouldn't that negatively impact the value of RRCEF for U.S. holders?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"You might be right on the share offering, but honestly it doesn’t really matter because my central point still stands, the $8-$9 levels precovid have that dilution calculated in still. It also cleared up debt and made them better in the long run so it’s still a win. Even with the share dilution. 

As far as your $100b price tag, is GE worth its market cap of $118.35B? While trading at 100+ TTM P/E or 12+ FWD P/E? Again your figures only work if RR trades at a P/E of 1 (it’s currently at like 1.4) if RR were to trade at even half of GE’s P/E, then the stock price would be hitting the $10+ levels. And it honestly can hit that as a smaller version of GE basically. $8-$9 isn’t a joke, it’s what it was trading at precovid with the share dilution calculated in.

Yes grow up, you got offended because someone on the internet asked you to look at a graph."
03/17/2021,stocks,"No because if you buy a share you’re buying RR in pounds but your broker is charging you the exchange rate. So even if the dollar got supper weak, you would just get paid a load of dollars to match that RR share price in pounds.

So like if you bought a share of RRCEF @ $1 that means you bought RR @£.85 (or whatever the conversion rate is) and your share goes up and down in pounds but you see it as dollars thanks to your broker showing you the exchange."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm sorry, but you're wrong. I feel like you don't understand what market cap is. I'm trying to help you out here. Maybe you're just trying to pump the stock for uneducated people or maybe you don't legitimately know.

Market cap is price x shares outstanding. So price is already part of that calculation. If P/E is 5, 10, 15, 800, whatever it is, that doesn't change what P is. 

Market cap of RYCEY was 17 billion in January 2020. The highest RYCEY ever got was 39.5 billion in 2013. You're saying that the 8,370,000,000 shares of RYCEY today can hit $8 dollars each. Do the math. That's nearly 67 billion. Now here's the kicker-- the P/E ratio of RYCEY in 2013 was around 9. 

GE, by the way, has a P/E ratio of 22, not 314 or wherever you found that number. Lets say, generously, RYCEY somehow is valued at half that P/E. That would be 11.

At 11 P/E, are they going to reach a valuation of 67 billion?

Your numbers make no sense.

Again, I'm actually bullish on RYCEY. I think it can return to pre-covid levels and I'm intrigued by the partnerships they've made to expand into other areas (like space travel.) But man... if you're dreaming of $8-9... or $13 - $18... I'd like to know what exactly you're smoking."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Man if you don’t know the difference between a TTM (trailing twelve month) P/E and a FWD (forward) P/E there’s no arguing with ya. Let’s break down what a changing P/E ratio will do. As the P/E ratio increases, that means either the price is increasing, or its earnings are dropping. If RR is in a recovery stage and able to turn itself around (as we both agree it will) that means it’s earnings aren’t dropping. But that P/E ratio is still rising to meet more with industry average meaning the price will have to increase to justify that move. That will change your market cap up to that $67billion level. Because when it fully profitable and up and running again it’s easy to see how it can capture a scaleable percent of  GE’s market cap of $118B. A P/E of 9 during their all time high sounds about right, and possible again with the future of aircraft and spacecraft. 

Let’s look at 2013 closer and examine what GE was doing around that time. It’s FWD P/E ratio was roughly between 14 and 12 that year meaning by your own number that RR was trading at 9/12 (or 3/4) (being conservative) or 9/14ths the size of GE. Now let’s translate that ratio to today. That would bring the FWD P/E ratio of a fully recovered, prime RR to 16.5. Compare that to its current ratio of 1.4 and you tell me what that means for its price. I am not pumping this stock. I truly believe it will hit those prices based off of this. You can huff and puff about diluted shares that are already accounted for in the graphs when you look back before they were sold. Or say I don’t know what I’m talking about when refusing to realize there’s more than one way for P/E ratios to effect market cap. I realize GE’s earning are down which is why it’s FWD P/E ratio is high compared to previous years but when you look at it’s true TTM P/E ratio of 314 you realize that 22 could have been a lot higher. This would suggest that even if GE comes back down to a FWD P/E of 12-14 like it normally is and where it was in 2013 when RR had a FWD of 9 and was trading at $8-$9 per share adjusted for October’s dilution. So seeing a fully recovered RR hit those levels again is not out of the question for me. It’s also not out of the question to possibly see it spike to higher levels depending on news about its contracts with SPCE. 

You’re not the only bull on RR and just because my price targets are higher doesn’t mean I don’t have a reason for it.  I’m not saying it’s hitting $8-$9 over night, it has a lot of debt paying and incoming to bring in but it’ll hit those levels within 3 years imo and then starting 5 years+ you might see some spikes into $13-$15 especially depending on their space engines."

Today Carnival brands just announced more cancelations.  This is in addition to cancelations just last week from Carnival and other brands.  I have also come into possession of a letter directly from Carnival to travelers.  In this letter it updates travelers on the current situation. It informs them they are unsure of when cruises will start again.  It also says Carnival will be giving travelers credits.  Credits means less revenue for Carnival per traveler.  Once they resume cruises they will no doubt be forced to do so at reduced capacity.  More lost revenue.

2021-03-17 00:22:21,stocks,"Market Commentary (End of the growth stocks selloff? Lessons to be learned and what to expect going forward) - 3/16/2021  

Hello investors,

I wanted to discuss three things today.

**1) Lessons to be learned from the tech sell-off**

**2) Is this the end of the growth stocks selloff?**

**3) What happens from here?**

**1) Lessons to be learned from the tech sell-off**

A lot of the hottest names in the street sold off more than 50% in the past few weeks. Nasdaq sold off 12% from its intraday highs.

In this Market Commentary, I laid out reasons why I thought these trends were happening and how I'm positioned in this environment.

I wanted to re-emphasize key lessons to keep in mind, which I alluded to here, as we are trading through these types of corrections.

1. Don't lose your money (sounds obvious but please read my explanation in the hyperlink above.
2. Learn from other people's mistakes but more importantly, from your mistakes.
3. Mental discipline is key.

I understand that some of you have just started investing in the markets this past year.

Let me warn you upfront that these types of corrections are minimal pains compared to actual bear markets.

I mean really, the recent corrections/recessions have been very short-lived. The longest correction in the past 3 years is 2 months. Take a look below.

2020 recession, 2018 correction

📷

2008 recession (\~1.5 years)

📷

Tech bubble (2.5 years)

📷

Early 1980s (\~ 2 years)

📷

My point is that corrections and recessions are not short-lived all of the times. Imagine your favorite stock dropping 70% over a period of 2 years.

The reason why I bring it up? I want to reiterate the importance of balancing your hedges, if you are not a buy-and-hold investor. (more on hedges here)

So always keep in mind bear markets can be dragged longer than you experienced so far.

Another key lesson to keep in mind is stay invested, as long as your security selections are solid.

I can't remember exactly what the stats are but it goes something along the lines of

""if you missed out 20 best trading days in the past 20 years, your annual returns go from 12% a year to 7% a year""

\*Please don't quote me on the exact figures but you get my point.

I don't need to go back too far to prove my point. Just look at the past few days.

📷

If you missed out on that huge gap up on 3/9/2021, you missed out a lot.

Keep in mind corrections create great opportunities, but don't underestimate the length of the correction period.

**My strategy, which doesn't work for everyone due to differences in risk tolerance, investing time period, and discipline, is to slowly buy into the dip in increments, and load up on existing hedges if I think the correction is headed deeper.** During this process, you'll be fighting lots of naysayers. Those who believe we are doomed for tech massacre. Those who think the days of growth stocks are over and now the value stocks will shine. Try to keep distractions out of your analysis and stay focused on your game.

**2) Is this the end of the growth stocks selloff?**

The short answer is yes, more likely than not.

Again, I explained in this market commentary why I think this is a short-lived correction and it was probably good buying opportunity.

Now, I want to prevent anyone from spending his/her life savings on stocks just yet.

Remember this game is about probability. Do I think the other guy on the poker table is bluffing? Absolutely, at 80% probability. But it could very well be the case that he actually wasn't bluffing and has trip tens.

My point is that anything can happen and we need to think in probabilistic terms, not absolute terms.

Based on a few technical indicators, it seems that the market is again heading for a bullish action but I'm not a huge believer in technicals so I give little weight to this sort of analysis.

📷

If you look at the above chart, you are seeing a consistent gap higher with high-lows and high-highs, meaning for each day, the low is higher than the previous low and the high is higher than previous high, commonly seen in an upward trending market.

Furthermore, it bounced back from its 100d MA support level, with three straight-up days.

I believe we are likely out of the woods but one or more events can turn things over in a matter of a day, which I will explain more below.

**3) What happens from here?**

I have repeatedly mentioned that the two key drivers of the markets right now are monetary and fiscal policies.

Therefore, any shifts in tone regarding these two policies will cause major changes in trends.

Key things to look at are FOMC meeting tomorrow (monetary policy) and Biden administration policies (fiscal policy).

I'm partially afraid that the Fed officials may say something that'll upset the markets tomorrow.

For instance, if their dot plots indicate faster than expected rate hikes, that would certainly be bad for the markets.

Or if JPow & Co suddenly shifts his tone to a more hawkish one given the rising inflation expectations, the risk assets won't like that either.

I am assigning low probabilities in either of those events happening, hence my view that the tech selloff is over, but it is a non-zero risk.

What I am more concerned about is the fiscal policy.

Biden administration is already considering tax hikes to fund deficits, specifically 28% corporate tax rates and higher tax rates for wealthy individuals.

Based on how the risk assets have reacted to Trump administration's tax cuts, I believe it is likely that the risk assets will react negatively to the proposed tax policies.

To summarize, I am still bullish for the long run but that view will depend largely on how the monetary and fiscal policies change. The Fed has reassured us that they will be very patient in the inflation front so I'm not too worried on that front. I am more concerned how the Biden administration will wind-down its spending earlier than expected, but no one can know how that will play out.

The best we can do is to stay invested and monitor the developments as closely as possible, especially the FOMC meeting tomorrow.

2021-03-17 00:21:59,stocks,"AAPL - How can I determine when to stop buying? Hey guys. New investor, and my plan was to put money in a few stocks, but focus mainly on AAPL. I currently own 13 stocks at 120.74. At what point should I say that it’s too high and wait for it drop? I know it’s not really 2nd hand knowledge on how to time the market, but what’s everyone’s opinion on what’s too high to pay for a share?"
03/17/2021,stocks,$100-$120 is excellent cost average. $120-$130 is pretty darn swell. $130-$140 is just fine but be ready to hold longer term.
03/17/2021,stocks,"1. As long as AAPL keeps innovating, and maintaining Brand Identity as the premium technology and personal carry hardware company, you shouldn't stop buying AAPL. 
2. Don't try to time the market.
3. Do not hope that a stock price falls so you can buy it cheap. If it falls you don't know that it's gonna rebound. Hope stock prices go up. That's the problem you want.
4. If you're waiting for APPL to drop - it's dropped. AAPL is on sale: 15% off all AAPL shares is a pretty good deal. So ignore number one and consider this a good time to buy more AAPL. 
5. Don't take my word for it: Duetche Bank target = $160, CitiGroup = $150, Morgan Stanley = $164, Motley Fool, Seeking Alpha, InvestorPlace and a bunch of other premium services call it a strong buy."
03/17/2021,stocks,I think aapl is safer than the bank.
03/17/2021,stocks,"In 2007 a buddy of mine (while we were in Iraq) invested like 36k in apple or something like that, when we came home he had like 600k."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don't agree with the thought Apple will always go up. Don't get me wrong, Apple is a great company with solid financials. But, that alone is not enough to say it will always go up. That being said, there are far worse things to buy than Apple."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's not just ""how much is it valued at"" but ""compared to what?""

When you look at any individual stock, you should look at the position that stock has in the overall market (as as a retailer such as AAPL compared to Samsung).  

* How is the market position?
* What is the strength of the currency by which you'll be buying the stock?
* How does the overall market look?

It's a comparison, what your dollar can buy you versus the number of shares that AAPL you can acquire.  Look at your other stocks, and compare them that way - by ratios.  Look at the AAPL stock and compare it to the overall market.  Those give you two barometers that are price independent.  

1 AAPL or 1 WMT?  Now what if it were 10 AAPL for 1 WMT?  

1 AAPL or 1 VTI?  Again, what if it were 10 VTI for one share of AAPL?

Berkshire looks expensive now, but since there hasn't been a split ... same can be said about TSLA, but there has been a split (and it's still over $600/sh)

My AAPL position this past year is up to a bit over $50K, with an average buy-in price of $68.  I use WMT above) because my buy-in price there was $113, so two of WMT for one of AAPL back in 2020?  

I'm going to sell WMT, but not buy AAPL at this time."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Honestly, if you're a new investor; I'd keep putting at least 50% of your portfolio/weekly funds into it until you can prove that you can beat it consistently with other picks. Be that either because you got better as an investor, or the current price is just too high."
03/17/2021,stocks,Its always a great time to buy Apple
03/17/2021,stocks,AAPL is a good long term play. PT is like 160 but if you look back over the last year I think the best it did was 138. Still room for growth. If you're looking for short term excitement look closer to cyclicals maybe
03/17/2021,stocks,"Look at AAPL's historic P/E ratio and compare it to it's current P/E ratio. Arguably, it's overpriced right now, but so is everything else. You got in at a good price but personally, I'm waiting for it to hit $100 or less before buying in."
03/17/2021,stocks,Stop buying when you make a time machine to stop yourself from buying
03/17/2021,stocks,Don't take any profit keep steadily buying

03/17/2021,stocks,The current prices are a BIG discount. Apple is as secure as it gets. Their recent numbers have been tremendous too. It’s absolutely a discount
03/17/2021,stocks,NEVER
03/17/2021,stocks,I have around 2000 shares. I can't stop. Help me.
03/17/2021,stocks,Just want to say thank you to everyone that responded. I read every comment and appreciate all the feedback and thoughts.
03/17/2021,stocks,*Insert South Park investment meme here *
03/17/2021,stocks,"the thing is, it might not drop below where it is.

just because drops are inevitable doesn't mean that future drops won't come after a run up. if the price runs up to $175/share, maybe it has a ""huge drop"" that brings it down to $145/share. look at TSLA for an example of this. it just had a MASSIVE drop a week ago, but it didn't bring it anywhere near what we could buy it for 6 months or so ago.

ideally what you want to be doing is making projections of what the value will be a year or two from now, and as long as it's under that price, just get a little bit whenever you can.

that being said, ideally you'd have some kind of a percentage limit in mind of how much of you're portfolio you're willing to dedicate to one company. i personally try to avoid letting one company represent more than 20% of my portfolio. (sure, it happens some times, so this isn't a set in stone hard rule)."

03/17/2021,stocks,"> AAPL is a good long term play. PT is like 160 **but if you look back over the last year I think the best it did was 138**.

you're forgetting that it hit like $400/share before doing a 4:1 split over the summer. if someone bought 1 share of AAPL 1 year ago (3/17/20) the value of that share that they paid $250 for is $480 today."

Can't imagine that you're likely to see the tax plan stay the same and you're going to see plenty of haggling over clean energy.

May be best to just try to ignore it for now. One thing to consider though is that markets like to price things in ahead of time. Wouldn't you think that you'd have seen some of that after it was obvious that Dems would have control of the senate (even if barely) and a tax raise was more likely?

2021-03-17 00:08:23,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 16, 2021. Please enjoy! Stocks fell on Tuesday, after the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) set fresh records yesterday, as market participants digested a weaker-than-expected report on retail, rising Treasury yields, and looked ahead to a Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week. 

Retail sales fell 3% in February from January, the Commerce Department said, worse than the 0.7% decline economists polled by FactSet expected. However, many analysts blamed bad weather and expect incoming stimulus checks to cause retail sales to spike.

Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. At the time of writing, the Treasury yield sits at 1.606%. 

In light of rising Treasury yields, market participants are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, where the Central Bank is widely expected to reiterate its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy while the economic recovery gains momentum. 

With large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus supporting economic activity, analysts at BlackRock are anticipating ""a much stronger post-COVID economic restart than what we would expect in a normal recovery. The rapid upward adjustment in U.S. Treasury yields and more muted movement in inflation-adjusted yields make sense in this respect, and are still consistent with our new nominal theme of higher prices and government liquidity.”

Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.

I have been getting unemployment benefits since last march (im a college student so its been a LOT more money than I need, and I’ve got enough to handle bills/surprises). I was wondering how much money I should try to have invested compared to sitting in a bank account, currently it’s maybe 80:20 in the bank:in the market (working on increasing that). What would be a good ratio to hit for long term growth?"
03/17/2021,stocks,I’m also a college student but i live at home and pay my own tuition. All I do is have enough cash for tuition in a savings account while keeping $100 a week for enjoyment/gas. I make around 2k a month so i invest around 1500. So for cash I’d say invest in however much you’re willing to lose and still be able to live comfortably

Second is APHA this stock just straight up angers me. All my stocks go up and down I mean that what stocks do right? But this stock acts like it's on a trampoline and keeps falling off of it and getting back up. Some days it's my highest earning and some days my biggest loser. It's never ever consistent. I also hold TLRY and that one has done nothing but lose me money. It has been consistently my biggest loser (I bought really high) but I'm ok with it. It's consistent so it is what it is. But APHA is just on a good one and it angers me. .

03/17/2021,stocks,What the hell you mean human behaviour doesn't care about theory's? The implication is that more money in the market is the cause for inflation. This hypothesis has been falsified in multiple occasions. There is only a minor correlation between inflation and the quantity of money in a hard currency.

2021-03-16 22:48:26,stocks,"Thoughts on WeWork going public this year I'm thinking about investing into WeWork when it goes public.

They failed at going public last year after poor management of finances and ouster of their CEO, and when the pandemic hit and everyone worked at home, it looked like it was over for them.

Since then, WeWork has been getting its shit together, and looks more like a real estate company, aka something real.

So less exciting but possibly profitable, good for stock market.

Here's why I think about investment:

* I've worked from home for 10 years and know how fatiguing it gets. About 3 years in I started splitting my time between home and Starbucks's.
* However, SBUX sucks for extended WFH and the vibe sucks. Traditional offices are gross and stuffy.
* Coworking spaces are generally better and WeWork is easily the best, albeit expensive. Proof? Go to Santa Monica. I toured 10 coworking spaces in SM a few years ago and they all were TERRIBLE except for 3- WeWork, ROC, and this spot Obama spoke at once. I chose ROC. They evicted all their tenants after not paying their sublease bill.
* Most WFHers have started to experience this kind of fatigue, but I think they're still early on the fatigue and we'll see that more.
* If post-pandemic, we see a net bump in permanent WFH and remote workers, there will be a greater need for good coworking spaces. And WeWork wins. Especially if most of these permanent WFHers are not in the same city as their employer, where WeWork gets their customers in company hubs in multiple cities.
* If post-pandemic, we instead see any net increase WFH coming from people living in the city, aka partial WFH, they'll probably just come into the office to get out of the house instead of a coworking space.

So (more responsible WeWork + to-be-seen WFH fatigue) \* (probability of post-pandemic WFH) = buy

No clue about the specifics of these numbers or evidence that WeWork got their head out their ass.

Looking for discussion."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I disagree, I think work from home being the future is exactly why shared office spaces have potential. My sister has been at a WFH only company for years, but they still regularly rent out meeting spaces for in-person meetings. That being said, I don't think that necessarily correlates to WeWork being a good bet."
2021-03-16 22:45:08,stocks,CLVS is over shorted and undervalued I bought CLVS because I found it is far to over shorted for whats its doing with its money. CLVS develops anti-cancer agents and I don't think cancer has stop existing just because coronavirus took over. Its spends a lot of money on research and development while the revenue that it brings in has been growing at a fast pace. I think its a solid buy and because its shorted so heavily @ 41.8% short float it is primed for another short squeeze.
2021-03-16 22:27:51,stocks,"How To Spot A Bubble Yes yes, another one of these. I thought this article was a really interesting read, and goes in-depth on the indicators of a bubble:

[https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc210315/](https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc210315/)

It is worth bearing (pun intended) in mind that the author is regarded as a perma-bear who has been bearish on the markets for most of the last decade, although he did call both the 2000 and 2007/8 crashes. I would rather discuss the rational of his post rather than his previous record, as it seems pretty spot on to me. It would be good to hear discuss counter arguments which aren't the common ones we see on reddit: ""Low interest rates"" / ""The Fed has our back"" / ""stonks only go up!"" (all of which were addressed in his post).

I will pull out some quotes below, though I would encourage you to read the entire article. I think the question I see quite often across the investing subs (even /r/valueinvesting recently), is that although we know we can't time the market, does it really make sense to overpay so much based on nothing other than fomo?

&#x200B;

>The expectation of growth produces the growth, which confirms the expectation; people will buy it because it went up. But once you are convinced that it is not growing anymore, nobody wants to hold a stock because it is overvalued. Everybody wants to get out and it collapses, beyond the fundamentals.

&#x200B;

>If prices rise, and expected cash flows haven’t changed, investors  recognize that future returns will be lower. In the “bubble” case,  investors have high expectations about future returns, mainly based on  past returns, and they act on those expectations by driving prices up  further. So the expectation of additional price increases is simply  reinforced. “The expectation of growth produces the growth, which  confirms the expectation.” 

&#x200B;

>The truth is simple but uncomfortable. If interest rates are low and  expected growth is held constant, higher valuations imply lower  long-term returns. If interest rates are low because expected future  growth is also low, higher valuations are not required. Long-term  returns will be lower anyway. A valuation premium just makes future  returns even worse. 

&#x200B;

>To say that margin debt to GDP is at the highest level in history is to  say not only that stocks are heavily owned on margin, but that those  stocks are also breathtakingly overvalued. That combination is  particularly worrisome.   
>  
>  
>  
>The value is in the future cash flows that will be delivered to  investors over time. The elevated price only ensures that the long-term  return between now and then will be dismal."
03/17/2021,stocks,You spot a bubble after it pops. Nobody really knows when that might happen. Anyone who gets it right likely just got lucky.
03/17/2021,stocks,It's literally in the middle of the image
03/17/2021,stocks,"His analysis is spot on. Of course claiming we’re in a bubble is different than timing the popping of one. Most here fail to differentiate between the two - “he predicted the last 80 out of 3 crashes”. For many that is enough for them to assume future returns are independent of current valuations (they aren’t). Everyone would agree that future returns are lower if you pay a higher price for a stock on a given day than a lower one. That future return logic falls apart for many when earnings increase 10%, but the stock price increases 30%."
03/17/2021,stocks,If interest rates rose to those levels. Stocks will be the least of your worries

Commercial business takes hit big time last year, but it will be recovering as there is unlikely any competitors in the next few year or a decade in commercial airplanes.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Thanks, you as well"
03/17/2021,stocks,"They’re not really competitors in any real sense. There’s no possible way that a new defense secretary can change that.

Aircraft are on contract for the next 5+ years, and Raytheon doesn’t have manufacturing capability to make aircraft like LM anyway. 

I’m not trying to crap on Raytheon, I just want to make it clear that their business models are quite different. They have may be quite successful, but there isn’t any conceivable scenario that would lead to them taking business away from Lockheed. Rather, Raytheon will continue to supply components for several aircraft in the short term.

But I would caution that LM’s acquisition of Aerojet threatens Raytheon’s future for some avionics, which is why they’re fighting it. Raytheon is having an ok year, but as a long term investment, there is significant risk."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Check out [my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/lnnfhu/lockheed_martin_dd/), I compare Lockheed to Raytheon in a couple of sections. I don't really know what you're asking here. Check out Yahoo Finance, Macrotrends, or Morningstar for financial information."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Looking at LM's backlog is an easy way to gauge a defense contractor's future and past success. Lockheed has a backlog of over 100B. They could not sign a single new contract for >5 years, and they would be totally fine."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes it certainly looks unlikely that the US government would ever just drop LMT as a client, not to mention the military industrial complex keeps throwing more money into defense overtime, but it's still a risk factor.

For a stock to make it into my top tier list of holdings it needs to both have a lot of good things going for it, and be diversified enough to not be overly dependent on just one product or one customer. That may not be a consideration for you in determining position sizes, but it is for me."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Google says 70%, but I'm pretty sure I read it was something around 82 to 84 percent when I researched them in the last month though."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I've been holding since $120. I'm expecting a return to pre-covid levels, however, BA is more of a reopening play whereas Lockheed is a value play no matter the conditions."
03/17/2021,stocks,"That’s fair. I am not as familiar with LM’s businesses. I am just going off the previous user's angle of the two companies as competitors.

What I originally stated is that both companies should see success as the two major players in the defence sector whether it be as competitors or as complimentary businesses."
03/17/2021,stocks,"That is a pretty good DD for LMT, not for RTX. RTX's fundamentals aren't as solid (largely because of Covid and undertaking a substantial merger) but their roadmap for their future development plans is solid and not always captured by financials."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes, I agree they would be fine and healthy as a company for many years to come. But these backlogged contracts are included in current forecast and priced into current share price. What isn’t priced into current share price are potential contract to be won in the future."

That being said, both are good holds. I calculate Raytheon FV at 96 giving it ~22% upside whereas I calculate Lockheed FV at 445 giving it ~27% upside. It’s hard to go wrong in the military contractor sector right now."

Sorry for all the questions.  Really any feedback on what your experience was with this website would be very helpful.  Thank you so much.  Sorry for any confusion."

I think my position looks like this 20c 2.50 3/19. Their EPS was -.2 but the revenue was greatly improved. Very new to options trading so i wont be too upset if my first is a bunk call, I've never had that beginners luck or any luck for that matter lol."

03/17/2021,stocks,"Lol u did weeklies on a penny stock and don’t even have a solid understanding of how options work?

People making a killing off of options aren’t playing blindly. A lot of them aren’t using luck from options to make money..they actually might know what they’re doing"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes, that was the conclusion."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Are you talking about naked puts? Because if you buy a put and it skyrockets, your option would just go down in value or be worthless. You cannot go negative if all you do is buy to open"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Oh I guess i'm mistaken then, my bad. My impression was that there's no loss floor on naked puts and you could lose more than what you put in, but I've never held a put for that long so I may be wrong. Thanks for letting me know! Makes me feel a little better about puts."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I think you are confusing a naked put with simply buying a put. A naked put is writing a new contract without owning 100 shares. Your downside could be huge if you were assigned and had to buy 100 shares that you don't already own. It's theoretically capped since the stock can't go below zero but in practice ya you could lose a LOT.

If you buy to open a put though, you can't lose more than the premium you paid. Same as buying to open a call.

Naked puts and naked calls both require margin and higher levels of options trading. I can't actually do them since I haven't applied and don't plan on it."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Thanks for clarifying, i thought naked options = buying directional calls or puts with no hedge but yeah that sounds way worse."

2021-03-16 21:02:52,stocks,"Can someone please explain to me why holding TQQQ for long term is a bad idea? I get that some commodity-based leveraged etf such as oil/gas etfs can experience significant decays during a volatile market and they tend to lose value over long term (ie holding period of more than 5 years).

That said, it appears that TQQQ has performed incredibly well during the last 10 years (with more than 10,000% gains in the same period), even accounting for a major market crash such as that in March 2020. 

If your holding period is say around 5 years and can stomach major market crashed, is there a solid reason why you’d want to stay far away from TQQQ? 

Really appreciate any constructive feedbacks :)"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Commodities are typically pretty cyclical. I’m very bullish on steel right now but it’s not really something you buy and forget for a long time, you make more on commodities by playing the cycles even if you miss the exact tops and bottoms"
03/17/2021,stocks,Why buy TQQQ when you can buy a 3x leveraged ETF on Tesla?
03/17/2021,stocks,"It's exactly what it says on the tin. 3x on the way up, 3x on the way down. If the market really crashes, TQQQ will just cease to exist. Holding it long term is not a bad idea per se but you need to watch it closely, you can't just DCA it."
03/17/2021,stocks,This seems like a smart way to handle market down swings. Buy the ones hit 3x harder. It’s just hard to know where the bottom is!
03/17/2021,stocks,"That’s always going to be true. SPXL bottomed out around $19, I bought in around $28 and sold around $48. I probably should have stuck to my guns and waited for it to get back to $75 area. I just wasn’t confident it would keep going that far."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Absolutely. But in a market pullback, the leveraged fund will get hit that much worse, which makes it REALLY need a big bull market to recoup its value. TQQQ lost 70% of it’s value in the COVID crash. Regular funds don’t drop that hard, so it’s easier to recover. 

But that’s also the upside of the leveraged fund. When you see a huge drop in a sector you believe in, you can buy the dip and enjoy the ride up. TQQQ is up over 400% from it’s March 2020 low"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes. The QQQ fund outperforms the TQQQ fund in that scenario. That translates to a -.77% change followed by a +.78% change. Which means TQQQ would move -2.31% followed by +2.33%. Thus it would move from 13,000 (theoretical start value), to 12,700, to 12,995.35."

2021-03-16 20:15:42,stocks,"Can someone give me some advice I grew up very poor and fucked up early in life and was in and out of jail before I  wound up in prison 2016-2019. I read alot in there about the stock market and various other things to educate myself but mainly how to make money legally. I got out 2019 with a newfound confidence and began working and investing every penny I had building my credit to ""excellent""  and was doing GREAT. 

Fast forward 2021, I'm married with 3 dependents and ive had to pull all my investing money for emergencies  and had quit investing for a while throughout 2020. Ive been trying to invest again but have had the absolute worst luck in doing so recently...

I work 2 jobs + day labor when I can and it's barely enough to scrape by. Once the rent/bills are paid I have around $200 left for gas,food, etc. This leaves nothing to invest so I took advantage of these last stimulus and have lost about 30% of it since investing again.  


I had a dream I could turn this 2k into 10k to invest in the SPY and safe growth etfs/stocks and I'm just watching the little money I have dwindle away. I'm just tired of being broke and not being able to provide for my family like I want to. I wanna buy my mom a house 1 day, I wanna own a house for the family I started and the stock market seemed like the only way for a collosal fuck up with no education to have a decent life. 

So what should I do? Pull the little money I have left and buy a handful of etfs to check back on in 10 years? Or should i Shut my little bitch ass up and work 4 jobs for the next 30 years?"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I don't know you, but have met people like you.  

* That criminal record is going to be the hardest thing against you moving forward.  It's going to haunt you whenever you fill out a job application, or when an employer does a background check.  You're up against the Federal Database, not to mention local records.

Get that sheet cleaned up.  Depending on the charge, you can work to get it expunged, and even file paperwork with ""the court"" to have it not show up in public records.  You'll need an attorney (criminal or otherwise) or file the paperwork yourself.  Again, it's a State and Federal issue.  Pay your money into this so you can...

* Apply for better paying jobs.  It's the hardest thing, coming home after working (shift work especially) and having to deal with the house.  But to gain time means you need to earn more.  To earn more often means applying for and getting another job.  Consider a 100:1 longshot of getting any job, but if it pays more, you take it.  
* Move.  The credit score will help you bounce around town, or to another location.  Immigrants to this country come here with literally nothing and open a mom-and-pop liquor store, dry cleaner or just start by cutting lawns.  Better locations give you better opportunities and of course cheaper rent.  Every dollar you save here is a dollar you've earned more from.  Don't worry about the kids school, the job the wife has, or anything else.  You need to make as much money as you can (legally) in a year, and if that means playing hopscotch moving from one 12 month rental (because you get one month free) then everyone has to suck it up.  

You have a few bucks, a few hours or minutes between your shifts.  Look at your expenses for places to cut.  Again, every buck you save if a buck you've earned

* Cars are expensive, new cars more because of payments and insurance.  If you need to or can, move down.  You can check the cost of registration / insurance as well.  
* Grab a wrench.  Wrench on your own car.  You have a computer, hence youtube.  A cheap socket set can help.  Check your tires and air pressure to save on gas.
* Use public transportation ... if you can afford the time.  It's a time suck, but if it works for you, it's cheaper than driving.
* Same goes for computers, TVs and everything else.  Use Craigslist and buy used as there are plenty of rich folks who have stuff and looking for someone to take it away (I have several monitors I'd donate, same with weights and even have done tires) if someone would just ask and come pick it up.  It's ""clutter"" to them, and to you it's a new couch or 55"" flat screen.  

Okay, now you have $1K (or $1 AMU for you pilots out there or 'a rack' for those who know) and need to figure it out.

* Liquidity matters.  Cars break down, payday loans are expensive and you need to pay for a late bill.  Keep your cash 3-5 days at hand, but not on hand.  If you have it, you'll spend it.  It shouldn't be impossible to get, just more inconvenient than swiping a card at the local market.  
* Get a credit card (or three) but try to NOT use it.  A debit card is just as convenient and you won't get hit with fees.  Pay those things off monthly if you do charge.  Avoid store charge cards (e.g. Macy's)
* Got a costco or sams?  Get a membership there.  Learn to buy in bulk, swapping variety every few weeks. 

Now here is the ""this is not financial advice"" portion with your money:

* 50% in an ETF.  You're not going to be paying capital gains, nor worrying about taxes on it because you just don't make that much money.  But you want to get used to putting a large portion away for at least a year and not touch it.  That's what an ETF does for you - keeps it away (but at hand) and it's not going to crash.  It'll grow with the market (and shrink) but also pay you dividends.  
* Sample ETF would be VTI which (someone said that over 10 years, including dividends) it was 12-14% rate of return.  But go broad market, ALL market.  
* 20-30% in companies that you like, use or want to buy into.  These are companies that you heard good things about, but want to sit on for a year.  Again, ETF for a year and these companies for a year.  You're not flipping these but holding on to them so plan accordingly.
* 5-10% in FU money.  This is your gambling money that you want to play and put into whatever floats your boat.  This is a reason why you get up, and a reason why you check markets daily to get that experience
* 5-10% in cash.  This lets you figure out ""good time to buy, right?"" type of companies and you can have cash on hand.  ALWAYS have this buffer.  If your stock does well, refill this buffer and when you get paid, you're throwing $20-50 into this buffer every few weeks.  If stocks go down?  You add more to this buffer from your paychecks and keep that percentage.  This keeps you ""dollar cost averaging"" in and out of the market.

TL;DR:

* Clean up your record
* Get new work whenever you can
* Always be moving
* Save money by not spending it.
* Break down your investments into long-term, companies and hold cash

G'luck man.

03/17/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't recommend investing that 2k in the stock market at all. Truth is, if anyone here knew how to 5x their money in a relatively short amount of time, they wouldnt be here. All the potential options are risky and you would likely lose all or a good portion of that 2k.

&#x200B;

If you want to work towards a better life for you and your family, invest that 2k in yourself. Look at the local community college and see what certificate or degree programs interest you and are in demand. Many certificates for different industries can be completed at night, and do not cost much. I'd start by looking at job boards and seeing what you need, and what would make the most sense for you in terms of cost, time, salary, etc.

Getting a better paying job will get you to the point where you have extra money to invest every paycheck in the stock market. \]

03/17/2021,stocks,"From someone with a similar background, don’t be in a rush to make up for lost time. Take it easy, deep breath, and always check your motives."
03/17/2021,stocks,Start with cutting expenses and saving money. Easiest way to make more money is to save more. It’s easy on paper but once you get it going you will be like wow. For sure should have about 6 months worth expenses saved up and keep that at all times. Then put into a retirement fund and never stop committing to it like a Roth IRA. After doing that look into investing. I say turning risk into less risk over the years. Invest in stocks then start converting into safer yields such as real estate. Then keep adding and never stop with the playbook. It will all work out but first you have to control your expenses or you will never win.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Don't sell when you see things turn negative. Follow the golden rule of only sell when things are green (you're up and indexes are up) and buy when things are red (they're down and indexes are down). Don't overdue it, buy and sell in batches not all at once.

Consider a mixture of 30% Dividends (i.e. GOOD, QYLD, or other stable monthly dividend). 30% Growth (Known companies Apple, Microsoft, ARKK stuff etc). 20% Safe ETF such as VTI, SPY, QQQ. 10% Active monitored i.e. leveraged ETF (SOXL, TQQQ, GUSH, UDOW type stuff) this is buy on red and sell on green index days. Keep 10% cash to buy on dips. Stay away from options, you're more likely to lose money until you become very familiar with options trading.


Patience is key, and impatience will lead to mistakes and losses."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I was in a similar spot about a decade ago... this is what I did (I went a little extreme but do what you will with it)

1. Reduce expenses... literally only the necessities (I only ate ramin and didn't even get a haircut for years)

2. Increase income (worked on building my skills and took all the time I was working in my second job and put that into finding an entry level position I could do for 50% higher than my highest paying job)

3. Save 10% of everything I made and put it aside did not touch it unless it could make me 10% or more

Just kept on doing this over and over and eventually I am living pretty snug"
03/17/2021,stocks,"This will be corny but stop investing in quick hitter stocks and invest in yourself. Save the money you're throwing at stocks and find a community college course or adult education program and find a gig that's not going to have you living paycheck to paycheck. Take care of yourself first, that will enable you to take care of your family and that will enable you to find the income you can afford to put into the market. You have time, civilization ain't going anywhere."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Work harder on yourself outside of work than you do on your job. Instead of investing try to start working out before work a little, reading books and listening to podcasts. If you want more out of life then you have to become more. I was in a similar situation and turned everything around within about two years"
03/17/2021,stocks,"First and most importantly, remind yourself every damn day how much you've accomplished in the last two years.  A lot of people would have given up. You didn't. That matters.  

Instead of looking for investment advice, I'd suggest starting somewhere like Dave Ramsey.  It doesn't sound like you're in debt (which is where he starts), but your money journey can be guided by someone like him.  It's about living frugally and how/when to spend money.   I'm guessing you already have that mostly down, and 3 kids aren't cheap.  But, it will help you keep your mindset of how to manage money rather than letting money/debt/expectations manage you.

Next, focus on making sure your credit is strong.  As a first time homebuyer, that's going to matter more than your down payment.  Clean up any late payments and do whatever you can to make all payments on time.  Learn how credit bureaus work.  All of this matters because there are first time homebuyer programs that allow for $0-3% down.  

So right now, you'll make more money making sure your credit is clean and that you have an emergency fund for expenses than you will doing speculative investing.  That's not going to get you rich quick, but if you can keep your head above water and move forward a little more every day, you'll have a lot of equity in a house by the time those kids are ready to leave the nest and get married, go to college, and be the adults you're raising them to be.

Hang in there, and best of luck on your journey."

03/17/2021,stocks," Look. You will see many winners in life over something so trivial.

Life isn't all fair. But both you and I KNOW deep inside that the odds of such event occurring to you is VERY VERY low.

There's constantly lottery winners around the world. There's constantly people who make jackpots in casinos. There's constantly.. you get the idea. But NONE of them are the norm.

For instance, the wsb subreddit has some people who made $1k to $700k\~2 million. But guess what, that sub has almost 10 million people. And many more that follow the sub but aren't subscribed (like me).

Even if 100 people posted unrealistic winnings, that's out of 10 million people so like:

0.001% of people.

Don't lose everything to pray you are that < 0.001%. Gambling is the best way to dig yourself to a financially worse position.

The winning solution to traditional investing is long term. Buy a well diversified broad market fund like VTI and hold for a lifetime unless you truly believe you know more than all the professionals (with many phds from schools like Princeton/MIT working 100 hrs a day to juice out 'a bit more' of money) in Wall Street long term.

And in meantime, invest in your family and yourself. Making yourself more marketable and spending proper time with your loved ones is what you should do. Try your best to make sure you don't regret your decisions 10 years later.

Hindsight is always 20/20. We all missed the next gamestop, bitcoin, amc, penn, tesla, etc. Guess what though. Those happen so regularly so who cares. Last year was Tesla. Previous year was bitcoin. You get the idea? There's always opportunities out there. Stop FOMO-ing and be realistic.

Making money from stock market is literally making money out of thin air. Why should you be rewarded more than anyone else for doing no work but getting yourself entertained through gambling?"

To answer your question, I don't know a single ""for sure"" company as I don't think that exists. As far as less risky investments are concerned, I believe Crispr and AMD (SOXL for those like me feeling bullish on the industry) are a buy after the pull back last month. I also bought  ARKK and ARKG on that dip. Thinking about AFRM as I believe it's a great payment solution that hasn't had too much attention yet. Apple is a strong buy for me under 130, and just added last week. Upper end of my risk tolerance -Tesla is a strong buy for me under 650, and a buy under 675.

03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm grabbing pltr tomorrow, finally joining the club!"
03/17/2021,stocks,I did the same thing and it then ran to $34. Cut the losses for a quicker play but ended up losing out on more. Hodl!
03/17/2021,stocks,I think your problem is that you don't have enough
03/17/2021,stocks,At least wait until next demo day.
03/17/2021,stocks,Sell covered calls.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Before you sell, I suggest you do A LOT more research into this company, because once you do, you’ll be wondering why you didn’t buy more. 

This is not financial advice. Long PLTR 400 shares."
03/17/2021,stocks,"what you’re thinking about doing right now is the exact reason I’m not a millionaire, twice now. if you have something you believe in long term hold on to that shit tight. It’s easy to say you’ll get back in... but people rarely do"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Reallocate as necessary. If you believe something else will make you more short term, move money there and try to plan better next time. Don't let profits or losses prevent you from creating the portfolio for you that feels right. I have a medium position in PLTR and since it is classified as a long term holding, I wouldn't typically sell it to buy the next hot stock I want; but if there was a scenario where it was the only position I could reduce to buy something like a FAAMG stock at a heavy discount, I wouldn't hesitate."
03/17/2021,stocks,Sell a long position to try and make quick short term gain... this is exactly why most people suck so bad at investing
03/17/2021,stocks,"I totally understand your state of mind at the moment. I believe it is okay to sell for a loss at times if you have high conviction in a stock that has a great roi potential short term. However, there are stocks that you never touch/sell. I try to keep my portfolio from 8-10 stocks. Out of them I try to have 2-3 long term stocks that I will never sell unless something changes. I would consider selling other stocks, and leave pltr alone. Watch Alex karp interviews and watch the demo presentation again to build a stronger conviction. You never know what will happen in the future, but I strongly believe this will be in the 1000s in 5-10 years. Just my 2 cents. Wish you all the best bro!"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Only sell at a loss now if you're sure you can make back the loss or more in something else. Otherwise, you've just locked in a loss. I'm bullish on this company and think it can hit $50 by EOY if the markets don't implode. I think they're building their base right now and establishing clients. Once those recurring revenues start kicking in, this company can pull in a lot of money."
03/17/2021,stocks,"i understand that urge to play with the quick money, but based on my personal experience, this sounds like a good way to lose your money. unless you have a short term stock that you have a special reason to be very confident about, just keep your $ safe where it is in PLTR and wait until you have a little extra new cash to play with before you go chasing after a quick gain with another stock. you (and me and 90+% of investors) are not smart enough or informed enough to outplay the big players who cause the short term shifts in stock prices."
03/17/2021,stocks,If u want to sell I suggest u wait it out when it’s closer to demo day in the first week of April. This is to minimize ur loss and get some small net gains. Don sell during the plunge.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Alex Karp, Magikarp. Coincidence? I think not."
03/17/2021,stocks,This is the way I
03/17/2021,stocks,"Palantir currently has revenue of 1.1 billion and a market cap of 50 billion. Apple has revenue of 275 billion and a market cap of 2 trillion. Even with 50% growth a year do you think Palantir will hit a market cap of 200 billion? I don't ask that to start of fight, but just as an honest question. I could see the stock hitting 50-60 if things are great, but more realistically I think it will slowly climb over the years. I think that the swings in price between the IPO and now demonstrate that people were buying with the future value already baked into the price."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I saw a segment of that interview with Alex Karp posted on YouTube a few hours ago.  

He literally said that speculators should buy another stock, because Palantir was dedicated to long term business plans rather than satisfying quarterly expectations.  

The honesty was refreshing.  He does sound a bit crazy.  And he looks kind of crazy too.  As a shareholder, that makes me like the stock more, because it's the crazy, ambitious people with long term vision who can build something that becomes massively valuable years down the road."
03/17/2021,stocks,That's a pretty good price. I'm very upset I didn't buy the dip at $20 last week.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yup, PLTR has been a rock solid covered call stock.  It’s always stuck in the same range and premiums are decent."
03/17/2021,stocks,Been doing both on PLTR; selling puts and covered calls.  I’m about 1/4 of the way to my cost basis.  If I keep this up; I might make enough in premiums for the entire cost basis by year end.
03/17/2021,stocks,">What is it’s big deal

Large organizations (such as governments and corporations) often have many subdivisions and different computer systems that don't talk to each other.  Decision makers in these organizations therefore don't have a complete picture of what is going on, and may have a difficult time evaluating future strategies or solutions to problems.

Palantir has been developing software platforms that deploy to a customer's systems, vacuum up their data, and create a digital model of what is going on inside a customer's organization.

This theoretically allows the customer to spot where problems and bottlenecks are occurring.  The models also allow decision makers to project how taking certain actions will result in different possible outcomes.  The value in Palantir's software is **giving customers the ability to make better decisions**, which should improve outcomes and financial efficiency.

Palantir's nearly 2 decades of investment in their Gotham (government) and Foundry (private sector) platforms may finally make exponential business growth possible.

&#x200B;

>why is it in the toilet now

Palantir went public in a Direct Offering late last year, and its stock got caught up in the   buying frenzy of technology shares.  PLTR soared into the mid-40s, before sector rotation brought its market price back to the mid-20's.

&#x200B;

>supposed to be amazing in the future?

Palantir has recently scored an impressive number of contracts with corporations and government agencies.  Its revenues grew about 50% year over year from 2019 to 2020, and the CEO believes sustained annual growth of 35% is possible.

The caveat is that Palantir's software deployment requires Forward Deployed Engineers (known as FDEs) to work with clients to integrate the software into the client's systems.  Critics of Palantir believe that this reliance on people, means that the product is not easily scalable and that the CEO's growth estimate is too optimistic.  Critics also point out that Palantir has existed since about 2003, but has done nothing but lose money since then.  That's why I compare it to the [Magikarp Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magikarp), because many investors seem to think the company is useless from a profitability standpoint, much like Pokémon video game players view Magikarp (Palantir's CEO is named Alex Karp, which is also a funny coincidence):

>Although this Pokémon is capable of surviving in even the most polluted ponds,\[1\] it is usually overlooked by trainers because it is pathetically weak.\[2\] Even in the heat of battle it will do nothing but flop around.

PLTR Bulls believe that Palantir's investments in making their software more modular and easily deployable, will reduce the workload on FDEs and allow the company to handle a lot more work per FDE.  If this happens, the company will be much more valuable and powerful than it is today, much like [Gyarados](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyarados), or what a Magikarp evolves into after a long and difficult levelling process.

PLTR is a risky investment IMO, but one that could pay off big for patient investors who are willing to wait years or even more than a decade for results.

Useless fish or future Sea Dragon?  Who knows.  I'm betting on the Sea Dragon outcome, but I really have no idea what will happen."
03/17/2021,stocks,"You are spot on with your points. The only things that I'll add in terms of speculation is valuation and fundamentals have been tossed aside by growth prospectus and I see PLTR behaving much in that way as adoption grows. The other thing being I'm not entirely sure PLTRs market share has been correctly identified. Right now its bulk is in defense contracts  which is the core of its software, but there are a lot private sector companies just testing the waters with what their analytics can deliver which tells me this can throw a positive wild card in expansion.

The $100 dollar target is more of a stretch goal and I'll be looking at how it has performed towards its first breakthrough of 50.00 in the first year to ramp up. If it's on track, I will more than likely expand my position to buy 400 more shares."
03/17/2021,stocks,Like Roblox. I'm a fan but not at 70's even 60's scares me when I compare it's valuation to way better peers. The only thing about Palantir is that ARK bought in to include for both which provides a strong level of support.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Just be aware that you have to own 100 shares per covered call, so for new investors that may seem like a big upfront cost."
03/17/2021,stocks,That’s what I needed.  Thanks bro.
03/17/2021,stocks,">The caveat is that Palantir's software deployment requires Forward Deployed Engineers (known as FDEs) to work with clients to integrate the software into the client's systems.

After spending a few years at a corporation, this argument puzzles me a bit (not arguing against you, just further adding). Every major 3rd party system requires we either pay a consult agency to set up or we hire a bunch of new people to set up and support the product. I'm talking about software like servicenow, PeopleSoft, SAP, salesforce, etc... All these require human capital, no different then what PLTR does. So personally, I fail to see how this is a negative other than scaling. But that's a simple solution, you hire more people."
03/17/2021,stocks,Roblox gained big today. Makes no sense to me. It should be no more than $50 imo.
03/17/2021,stocks,No prob.  Glad I could help.
03/17/2021,stocks,"This is where I disagree. This might be my strong AAPL bias speaking as I’m holding good chunk of their shares. 

Apple just exited from negative echo chamber in regards their laptops. They fixed the hardware issues (notably the keyboard), there’s rumours that ports are coming back (due to high demand from the power users). Due to their integrated ecosystem they were first ones to pull off ARM architecture and actually exponentially improve the performance and battery life without even needing a fan, and this is just a beginning. Look up YouTube channels and there are PC users making videos on why should people switch to Apple products. They are about to dominate the market like no one ever done before. Here the thing. Once you purchase iPhone AND a computer, consider yourself locked into their ecosystem, meaning the cycle will be going on for at least a decade.

Ad revenue: look how they are fencing off social media platforms from collecting excessive amount information for advertising purposes. Does apple really care about the privacy? Maybe, but they are not doing for the sake of privacy. My pure speculation is that in coming years, social media will have to go through apple to access hashed information so that they can send personalised advertisements via apple to their users. And guess what, Apple won’t be giving away they user hashes for free. 

Plus we have speculations of Apple tipping their toes into cars, VR (possibly gaming as well?) etc."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Well all of that is cool. But apple products are known for being expensive, not an advantage. And I wouldnt say that they are the leaders of innovation of mobiles, computers. Those days are over now. Im not saying that their phone sales will decline, but im saying there is a risk because of the asian phones being cheaper and in many cases just as good as the apple products.

When it comes to new ideas like the apple car i think thats cool but in order to make alot of money from the apple car they need to have advantages from their competitors. Im not saying its impossible but its harder for a company that is specialiced in tech.

These are just my opinions ofcourse. What do you think?"

03/17/2021,stocks,"I'm bearish on the market these days, but bullish on WMT. Should be a productive asset whether the overall market goes up or down. Earnings are lower because they are investing aggressively in tech to compete on the same level as AMZN. Like AmazonBasics, Walmart is making moves to produce its own private label goods. Let me add a few things extra:

* Walmart bought Bonobos (apparel ecommerce) a couple years ago and they are developing their fashion offerings
* Walmart has developed a line of electronics with Roku ([https://www.roku.com/products/audio/walmart-onn](https://www.roku.com/products/audio/walmart-onn))
* Walmart is even dipping their toes into banking by looking to serve underbanked (low income) groups of people ([https://m.benzinga.com/article/20181461](https://m.benzinga.com/article/20181461))"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Work for Wal Mart for a bit and you'll understand,

I think anyone working for retail doesn't have the best job, but moving the wage to $15 should make it much better. It took them long enough, but Walmart is a step ahead of the minimum wage mandates going in later this year. That's going to hurt retail stores that can't afford it no doubt."
03/17/2021,stocks,I think tech is a misused work in investing land. Everything is tech. For example — Microsoft is software and cloud tech. Square is fintech. Amazon is ECommerce tech. Virtually everything except commodities and customer cycle companies could be considered tech imo.

03/17/2021,stocks,CMPS. Interesting.
03/17/2021,stocks,Own some energy and food stocks. Those really are necessary and tech companies rise and fall like wheat
03/17/2021,stocks,"Everybody has their own comfort zone and risk/reward levels. 

Right now my entire portfolio consists of Amazon, ARKG, BABA, BYND, CLOV, DIS, IPOE, PINS, SE, SQ, TSLA, NET and a micro position in NOK that was a gamble gone wrong lol. 

Out of all of my stocks, the only one that isn't tech based is really Disney, and even then with their new streaming platform they're sort of a tech play in that aspect (not full fledge tech, but you get the idea). 

If I wanted I could really divide it up anymore and just say that ARKG and CLOV are my healthcare plays. BYND is my food play. IPOE and SQ are my financial plays. PINS for social media and ad behemoth. SE and Amazon for Ecommerce and everything else they're getting into. Tesla as an automaker play, an energy play, and AI play. 

Tech is the future obviously, so why would anyone not be tech heavy? Doesn't make sense to me."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Personally, I'm not too much of a fan of the VXUS (remember BRIC?  How are those countries doing these days with regards to the pandemic and global economic outlook?) but think your portfolio is pretty solid.  

50% is solid stake (okay, you have 45%) in VTI.  Absolutely and positively little to nothing wrong with that.

You diversified into some very strong players, including ICLN and of course tech players MSFT and AMZN.  

The only thing I'd be leery of is your cash position (2.5%) is rather low.  I'd advise having 5-10% there to act as a buffer ""just in case"" expenses pop up and to give you the buying option when the market corrects inevitably.  

Assume a $100,000 portfolio with a 10% cash position that you're trying to maintain, and a quarterly balancing act.  The market declines by 10% so your stocks go from $90K to $81K, meaning your cash position is now overly large compared to your portfolio ($10/81) so you buy in.  

Reverse happens, market continues to grow and you continue to deposit regular paychecks to bolster that cash position - but can't keep up.  $90K grows to $120, and $130K but your cash position is $12.5K.  It's time to sell and recoup some of your gains.

This is more of a ""how"" versus a ""what"" as your ""what"" is solid."

03/17/2021,stocks,"Exactly. As I mentioned above, I'm invested in many different industries within tech. Ecommerce = the new retail. IPOE and SQ = banking sector. Tesla = automotive, AI and energy play. I'm well diversified."
03/17/2021,stocks,">His reasoning is that it is simple, it removes emotions, it is diversified and with how global the economy has become is even diversified in other countries' markets.

Weakness?

It is boring.  You won't care about how the market works, you won't be investing (directly) into TSLA or MSFT or AMZN.  

So while you'll maintain a steady march, you may miss the leaps and bounds of certain aggregate sectors (or companies) that you /know/ are going to be leaders.

Beans and rice make a great staple for meals, but do you really want to eat it 7-days a week because it's the most economical and filling option?

03/17/2021,stocks,"Corsair counterpoints: computer hardware margins are razor thin in most areas. It is hard to raise margins on non-unique products when competitors have already set the floor. Corsair, overall, has very poor vertical integration (most, if not all, Corsair products are not produced by Corsair) similar to most in the space. The company is almost completely dependent on external manufacturers, making them subject to product shortages and other issues like QA that would otherwise be in their control. Corsair lacks any significant technology patent portfolio.

In fact, aside from El Gato (whose long-term viability is heavily related to the continuation of the console cycle), the major selling points of Corsair are availability and reputation. Corsair has not recently shown investments to improve customer satisfaction, and so rating them as a ""can't miss"" prospect in tech seems akin to fool's gold since Corsair (as mentioned previously) do not control means of production. Corsair are a dominant player due to the sheer amount of involved PC hardware markets, not because they have a proven intrinsic patent portfolio value or unique services and software. Biggest doesn't always mean best, so for me they are a paper tiger. To me, there is no strong basis as to why a vertically aligned company would not easily overthrow their current position."

Weed is cheap to produce, but some huge corps might slowly win through economy of scale and superior logistics networks. Of course, no mom and pop store will advertise openly that your bud comes from the Cargill of weed.

It's similar for craft beer: In the US and Europe, you have maybe half a dozen malters, yeast manufactuers and hop distributors which dominate the market and supply all the indeoendent craft brewers just as they supply the material for premium products of legacy brewers. Companies like Lallemand and Barth & Haas might not be known as evil giant corps because the value of their industries is low but for example the Blätter can absolutely influence the businesses of hop farmers in Yakima Valley or Hallertau significantly"

That is fine. Suit yourself, but you will miss out on the whole point of investing in cannabis. The point is to catch the massive growth and hype that comes along with the lead up to legalization. Green Thumb has increased 10x in the past year. I’m expecting another 2-3x in the next year with the announcement of SAFE act. Institutional investors are CHOMPING AT THE BIT to get into these companies. Getting in BEFORE the institutions is key. This is funding my early retirement.

Average people don’t fuck with shatter and I think edibles/flower will always be the way most people enjoy cannabis. Current data shows that most cannabis is sold as flower with only like 10-15% sold as concentrates. Shatter is really rough on the lungs too from my experience. The whole process around smoking wax/shatter/etc is more like a true crack-fiend experience with torches and pipes, etc. While cannabis flower is very similar to wine and I envision a huge connoisseur-culture just like wine where some wine snob is chasing a ‘98 Tempranillo because the grapes were fantastic that year. 

I know people are excited about concentrates but flower always has been and always will be the most popular way to consume cannabis."

In regards to the mom & pop thing, yea sure it might be the sentiment for many buyers. But despite the hatred for large companies, most people are price motivated more than morally. And as u/ganbaro mentioned, even the mom & pops will undoubtedly be mostly stocked with the Phillip Morris newest branding to look craft.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah flower is much more popular and my thought is that it always will be. Flower creates a kind connoisseur culture similar to wine. With the various tastes and effects of hundreds of unique strains, various growing mediums, etc. it’s very similar to wine culture. I think vaping cured flower will be the predominant way of consuming cannabis. I think edibles will be popular for the people who don’t want to vape. 

Shatter and other concentrates provide more of a crack-fiend type experience with torches, and glass rigs, etc. I just don’t see it becoming mainstream. Sure there’ll be a percentage of people who prefer concentrates but I don’t see it gobbling up the market. Also, that shit is really harsh on your lungs. I tried it for awhile thinking I’d take less hits and ingest less smoke causing less damage to my lungs. However, I found that it was really doing a number in my lungs, noticeably worse than vaping flower."

In terms of how and where they’re used, cigarettes are closer to caffeine than weed. While the production side of tobacco is more similar to cannabis than alcohol, I think it’s more likely that consumers will see cannabis as an alternative to alcohol than cigarettes."

03/17/2021,stocks,"The preference share (VOW3), which is the ""real"" stock where most people would normally trade, has completely decoupled from the common share (VOW) in the last few days. VOW is thinly traded, as you said it only has a 10% free float, but weirdly it is the instrument on which the VW ADR is based upon in the US. My view is that on the back of the EV hype (see recent announcements from VW CEO) there has been a lot of retail buying from the U.S into the ADR, which in turn was poured into the thinly traded VOW pushing up its price well beyond VOW3. I can't see the short interest in VOW from bbg but someone is getting squeezed for sure. In my view the two should converge as they have always traded relatively close to each other and have no fundamental reason to decouple so if anything now there should be an arbitrage opportunity, buy VOW3 and short VOW.

EDIT: grammar"
03/17/2021,stocks,I agree.... It feels very reminiscent of the 2008 squeeze. Read up on it if you haven't done so already. Major squeeze on similar dynamics. I haven't put on a short leg to the trade but will look into now. Thanks!
03/17/2021,stocks,Your data must be stale. I got 10% from BB. Where are you looking?
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes that is a textbook case of short squeeze. I guess the only word of caution is that as we have seen recently these movements can be exacerbated even more, well beyond fundamentals, so it might be that the VOW/VOW3 spread gets even bigger before normalizing..."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I thought about it a bit more. Have read on bbg that on top of the 90% there is another 2.3% which is held by a trust in Austria connected to the Porsche/Piech family, so free float is more like 8% and short interest is 9% according to IHS markit (vs only 0.5% for the pref). So I think that irrespective of fundamentals it is very dangerous to short VOW now, if the U.S retail keep buying the ADR (just because they like the stock and the EV play, not necessarily to force the squeeze) there could be another massive run up in VOW..."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I’m looking at it now. I’m not adding a short leg to the trade. Actually looking to add more to my VOW long. Regardless of any ‘squeeze intentions’, if more is on borrow then floated you are going to have to deal. Look at historicals and you will see major gaps up on VOW. It ran up to €1000/share. Volume is leading me to believe we could see similar price moves."

03/17/2021,stocks,"I think is a very undervalued company. It is true that their phones adventure probably is going to end but their 5G adventure has just begun. Thats explains why the shifting and why they are rebalancing assets and workers...**It ""just"" 10% of the workers**... **Logically, 10%, and logically every big company, even Amazon, had to take hard choices, including firing workers and look what Amazon is today**. Especially in such a harsh moments for a lot of companies like this Pandemic...In every crisis there is opportunities and i think Nokia is taking the opportunity to turn on the engines again. As a company reposition in the correct market.

They are going to partner with Microsoft, Google, Amazon to develop 5G and Cloud infraestructure (if they don't have already). There are mainly 4 developers of 5 G as far i know. Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. The Americans are rising scepticism about Huawei due to the spionage and hackings turmoil. Ericsson just has started a battle with Samsung about patents that i don;t see how is beneficial. And we have Nokia, a company in almost historical low records but with a clear path shift and consolidated partnerships, not only with the BigTech but also with more than 100 countries around the world. I am smelling here there is a potential comeback but, yes, the financials are bad. I am not an expert but something is telling me that this IOT stuff, and 5G stuff, Nokia is going to say a lot because many govs, rising govs, don't wanna put their critical infraestructure under chinese Huawei surveillance orbit. Even Huawei is forced to be delisted from American Stocks i guess. The people and companies who are promoting Huawei is because they are pouring them with money. Until, the gov bans them. I think there is something boiling under the radar in terms of security and is a matter of time they are being forced to choose. So. In case of Nok. I think they have a potential comeback, taking into account the impact of 5G-IOT in full implementation, new internet speeds, their know-how in connectivity, the players and the last catalysts.

I forgot, also rumours of acquisitions around. Microsoft, AT&T and others i guess.

What i am not sure is the impact of Starlink internet. If they are competitors, is a paralel connectivity or what. Cuz that project is quite silent always.

**Personally**, i think is a very undervalued company and it is a cornerstone of the 5G independence in Europe, Latam, maybe America, maybe India...

It's a perpetual cycle which can't be broken without one of two parts changing (yes I'm only talking about investor and customer) and trust me that neither of those two sides will change on a large scale because investors want more money meanwhile customers want lower prices.

For example, I think in Cali, non-competes aren't a big issue, but imagine companies in say Texas barring engineers they fire or who quit from working with other companies? That would significantly hinder innovation due to people moving and spreading ideas/experience less. For example in SF, a lot of engineers change jobs like every 2-3 years, you might start off at Amzn, then go over to Fb, then Google, Nflx, each time you're learning and gaining more experience and knowledge which helps the company and increases competition as a whole.  
Besides unions generally have more pro's than cons, the fee's are negligible vs the actual benefits 9/10 in most industries and sectors."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Well, the point of a union is not just to secure *your* position, but to secure the position of *all* employees at *all* companies. If you want to depend on the fact that youre in a high demand position, then thats your choice. I wouldnt, but the traditions with unions in Europe are very different from the US.

Also, theyre not necessarily talking about firing 5-10k engineers."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I work in Compensation for a F100 tech company. I can’t speak for all large cap companies and where their morals lie, but at my company, we are not this cold hearted. When we do large layoffs (like we did for COVID), we run several programs to create to least impact as possible. For example, we offer an early retirement option, which is a nice compensation package. It’s completely optional. We also offered flexible work schedules, so people could reduce their workweek to 4 days (cutting pay by 20%). If we still haven’t cut enough OpEx to meet our goal, then we start the layoff process. But instead of just firing people, we actually have job fairs and allow the vulnerable people to scour the open job reqs and see if they can get placed in a different position at the company that hasn’t been eliminated. Finally, for those who don’t get placed are given a severance package.

On a separate note, layoffs are a totally normal part of the company growth lifecycle. Business units get spun up, invested in, and then get sunset when/if they don’t become a revenue driving product/service/feature. Employees are free to job seek and change companies at their own discretion, but the business is treating them like “garbage” when they’re the ones separating from the employer? It’s a double standard."
03/17/2021,stocks,"If a company can fire me and improve it's bottom line, it means I'm not a productive employee, I'm a drain leeching off the labor of my coworkers.

03/17/2021,stocks,it's just work. people should probably not dump their lives into it.
03/17/2021,stocks,"People that do that are dumb. It's not the 50s. People don't stay in one company their whole lives and ""work their way to the top"" any more, like those old ""company men"" from black and white TV sitcoms. 

Your loyalty should be to whoever's paying you, while they're paying you. From 9 to 5. No staying late, no working weekends, no working while sick, no unpaid overtime. If you don't have work-life balance, or you find yourself getting overly invested, that's on you. 

When it comes time to fill that manager position, most companies look to bring in new talent, not promote existing talent. You should be the same: you've gotta move out to move up. Get a better job elsewhere, for 2-3 years, then move again. 

If you choose to waste your life being loyal to a particular corporation, and expect them to give a damn about you as an individual, you deserve what you get."

03/17/2021,stocks,"They didn't do it just to increase shareholder value.  They did it to save the jobs of the other ~80k employees.  They need to invest in R&D.  They need funds to do it.  Huawei and Ericsson would not hesitate to put their boot on Nokia's throat if they start to lag behind on 5G.

They've put their eggs in this basket to save their company.  Try to look at the bigger picture here. Cutting 10k jobs now is very painful.  Dumping 90k jobs 3-4 years from now because they didn't make that difficult decision to cut jobs earlier is unconscionable."

If the business was failing and they needed to cut costs, then sure. But just to grow faster? No way they will get a cent from me. Hopefully with the new generation of social conscious investors we can push companies to make decisions that don't harm their workforce by boycotting their stock if they do.

yet I feel there´s a difference between small companies trying to get by, compared to gigantic corporations that do everything to please shareholders. there are other companies amassing debt year after year, yet they get celebrated by wallstreet. 
the company I work for was close ot bankruptcy last year as well. we were sold and now we are not firing, but hiring. we are doing everything we can to reinvent and change the whole structure and basically our core business model. 
addendum: I am also pretty realistic about our companies numbers and know all too well that if we do not reach our new targets for a prolonged period, things (aka human ressource strategy)  will definitely change. 
our new overlords told us straightforward that they do not plan / want to let go anyone. yes, people left. but none got fired because numbers are bad. 
but of course I know financial realities are what they are and sometimes there are simply no other options to shed costs."
03/17/2021,stocks,"well, I am living in germany and indeed I think my cell phone bills are way too high, kowing that germany has some of the highest costs of communications. (e.g I pay 29 euros for my contract that includes 2 GB of data volume, while providers in austria charge 14 euros für 35GB. ) 

I also ask myself why electricity bills in germany are almost at 25cents / kwh, as the EU average is a mere 0,20cents/kwh. mind you, thats the AVERAGE. 

also, please enlighten me what Nokia has to do with mobile phone bills ?the two biggest carriers in germany (vodafone and Telekom) use Huawei and Sony / Ericcson equipment... but you do you."
03/17/2021,stocks,"well... there´s plenty of studies and statistics showing that atually about 20% of employees in any company do 80% of the work, achieve 80% of sales targets etc etc. its the pareto principle to the extreme. yet it is also a common flaw to think companies can structure their sales teams (as an xample) of only high achievers and get rid of this disparity. there is no perfect organisation that has ever been able to disprove the pareto principle. some shift percentages, but the general logic still aplies. 

thats why loads of people see to large layoffs as a really bad sign. it almost always is only short term measures that rarely get rid of core problems"

03/17/2021,stocks,"It’s awful when the choices are strategic going after those soon eligible for pension. A person puts in their life thinking the pension will be there but then, no.

There’s a through-line throughout the movie where Wozniak wants Jobs to publicly acknowledge the Apple II team for their contributions to the company. In the 3rd act (taking place in 1998, two years after jobs returned to Apple) and Wozniak confronts Jobs about having laid off the Apple II employees. Jobs replies that the company had been 3 months from bankruptcy, streamlining was necessary, and that despite the Apple II being discontinued in 1993 the entire team was still on the payroll."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Face it, these sorts of announcements/drastic action are to boost share price. The truth is real change takes time. Nokia could just let people leave / offer early retirement and not replace them etc. and slowly evolve the company - that doesn't get a CEO his fat bonus check though.

It's easy enough to say ""get with the program wageslave"", however it's a very different prospect when you lose your livelihood because someone else wants a short term gain."

03/17/2021,stocks,">Germany has tougher labor laws.  VW didn't think twice about laying off people in the USA when they needed to.

That's how it started, but I don't think it's just that. These large, old companies which are often family run (more than half of the voting shares VW is still owned by two families) do have a somewhat special relationship with their workers. Now, **not all of them**, they do still hire contractors to skirt labor laws by adding new people they can't easily fire, but at the core there's a group of people which are well protected and get great benefits, but are also quite likely to be loyal to the company.

The system is based on a so called ""Betriebsrat"" (workers council). Those are protected by law and enable the company to negotiate rules with its workers. That can be a pain in the ass for both the company and poor people in IT like me who just want to analyze some data, but it also means that there's a good way to find mutually beneficial solutions when times get tough. E.g. no lay-offs but people accept paycuts or pay rises are dependent on how profits develop.

VW actually [wanted to have such a system in the Tennessee.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-union-vote-idUSKCN1TG014) But thanks to some fear mongering from local republicans the workers voted against it."

I don’t like the sense of entitlement that’s completely disregarding the well being of the company itself. The truth of the matter is they truly don’t care about the company and only jobs for themselves or people like themselves and if they cared about the company? I’m sure plenty of jobs would of been available to everyone. Look at chick fa la ....... now that’s a company doing it right and a fast food chain at that .

The only solution is to get a semipermanent magnetic connector and duct tape it in place.

So yeah this isn't the same company."
03/17/2021,stocks,Yeah I am shocked r/stocks is taking layoffs so negatively.

03/17/2021,stocks,"The converse issue however is when corporate heads look at positions in an org chart as a number on a balance sheet with not enough recognition of the value that they generate for the enterprise. It’s fairly common that divisions get restructured or positions get eliminated with an erroneous assumption that the workload will just get seamlessly redistributed into other roles.

This is a red flag for me. There’s a legitimate chance that the company as a whole starts operating much more poorly because the remaining employees are humans and can realistically only absorb so much extra burden. Lots of stuff that is getting accomplished now, likely won’t continue to once this happens. Depending on what that is, it could be relatively inconsequential or it could be tasks that are quietly at the foundation of other operations."
03/17/2021,stocks,I would note that likely a lot of the growing divisions are less about the manager feeling important and more about the amount of work being asked for and managers trying to avoid overworking their employees.
03/17/2021,stocks,It’s a hard balance. Especially when a company is on the ropes like Nokia. You either have to cut employees for R&D or go extinct and lose every job and potential stock options employees hold. Never mind the third option of releasing more shares or liquidating assets which are a wet blanket. I bought a low stake in on the news.

03/17/2021,stocks,"The idea that 10% YoY growth is sustainable is crazy. We have a finite amount of resources on this planet. If the stock market only works when it is growing, we are headed for a problem. Anyone can see that. We can argue economics until we are blue in the face but it misses the point that the stock market does not *have* to prioritize only the dollar. The biggest criticism is that business kills everything else in life that isn't business. I'd much rather invest in a company with lower yields that is trying to do good in the world as opposed to one that is solely about the dollar. I understand that a philosophical and moral investor is not common, but it doesn't have to be rare forever. The market is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The companies that get the most investment are most frequently the companies that succeed because they have the capital to do so. You may disagree, and that is fine, but I believe capitalism still works if have 2% YoY less growth to promote higher income equality."

I worked as an artist host (taking care of the artists backstage) before covid struck down that sector, and the boss gave me a list of drinks and snacks the artists ordered, but I was free to think of extra things within a certain limit.

I did extra things like making sure towels were close to the stage (especially for the drummers),
Give some bands that needed to travel far a few extra beverages for on the road and such.

The main goal was to make the artists feel welcome so that while planning their next tour our stage was one of the first to come to mind.
And I had several artists and bands that were very thankful of the care and help I provided them.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Right to work is different than at will employment, which is what you’re describing. 

At will employment is the law in every single state that says that employees can be hired/fired at any time without notice for any reason or no reason (other than “protected” reasons like race, gender, etc. and people that have employment contracts). 

Right to work laws, counter to popular belief, don’t limit your ability to form a union, they make it illegal to require that 100% of employees of a unionized employer pay the fees of said union, regardless of whether or not they’re members (to solve the “free rider” problem, since by law benefits in a unionized shop shave to apply to both union and non inion employees). It’s seen as anti inion because it severely limits the power of those who do unionize by giving people and incentive not to join."

I almost feel like I need to just stop buying options for a while and simply stack stocks."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I know nobody is going to read this but I just have to rant somewhere. A buddy pulled me into the stock market at the end of last year showing me his gains and egging me on to get involved because of how easy the money was. He turned $5000 into $20000 in 6 months and wanted someone to share in the joys with him. I don't like losing money, so i spent a solid month researching, learning, and playing around in a paper account until I started making good moves and saw imaginary gains. I promised myself I wouldn't put real money into my account until February as I wanted a full month of ""experience"". On Feb 1 I deposited cash into my account, made this new Reddit account, and started participating in discussions. I've lost almost every penny that I've put in.

Every position I took would have made me good money but my timing was completely off. For instance, I started playing with penny stocks and bought IN ND before the spike and doubled my investment. I sold some for profit, but the stock dropped and I lost a lot of the gains on what I had left in it. I invested in HI TIF and ET FM and the same thing happened, the price went up, I didn't sell, and then it fell again. I got into R KT and watched it take off but then watched it come crashing down again losing a good bit of money. Friday I bought Mar19 M ARA puts because I was confident the stock would fall but instead it skyrocketed and then Monday it kept going up. I decided to cut my losses and today those puts would be worth a ton.

Being able to spot good moves seems to be something that I am pretty good at doing. Knowing the right time to sell is something that I have a lot to learn on. I never realized how important timing was and I guess in the paper account you don't have any emotions because it's all imaginary money. So when you're looking at how much money you're down you just want to get out. It's like you're drowning and you have to breathe and you're willing to do anything it takes to get your head above water. It's a damn scary feeling and I don't know how to get over it. I'm not used to feeling like that and as much as I'd like to say I'm in control of my emotions I'm really not. All weekend I kept watching B TC's price go up and kept dreading how much money I was going to be losing on Monday. I couldn't sleep because of the dread. Even though I knew in my brain that the stock would be going down before Friday, I just couldn't stop myself from selling because of that drowning feeling.

Maybe trading isn't for me or maybe this is something everyone goes through and there's good advice out there for people like me?"

Make sure to broaden education with books / audiobooks.

Feb 1 was a rough time to jump in.

Maybe try investing before trading. Learning valuation of companies and economic infrastructure probably takes more than a month.  You might want to look at a newer edition of Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor to look at value investing, a recent book on index investing, and a course on financial statements.  There's a classic, Memoirs of a Stock Operator from about 100 years ago which is entertaining and covers a lot of the perennial shadiness of the financial world.

Speaking of which, buying options your first month is considered risky.  Many traditional brokerages would not allow that. I'm learning about options now from the okay podcast ""Options Boot Camp""

So I’m just reiterating how silly what you originally said was. Maybe you think the election was stolen, and you don’t have faith in the system anymore, and you’re waiting for the system to fall apart, but you projected and made it sound like it was “this other group of people” that you’re not a part of. But you were really talking about your own views and projecting them onto this mythical large group of MAGA investors. Just say that that’s how you feel, and how your political in-group feels, but that’s not how half of America feels. Most people in this country aren’t so desperate for emotional validation that they have to concoct a story about election fraud, and that number is shrinking.

Furthermore given short/medium term inflationary pressures, margin compression, and people using stimmies as the economy reopens on services vs. goods i cannot fathom nike's current valuation. 

.....

as for sbux, i think the market seems to be pricing in that things will get back to 2019 life. people will go to sbux again but not as often as they were in 2018-2019."

03/17/2021,stocks,...oh shit virtual amiibos. Nevermind i changed my mind how do i capitalize on this?
03/17/2021,stocks,Marketwatch article is irrelevant... “basketball” shoes are not and have never been Nike’s top mover. None of those companies you mentioned are close to Nike in annual gross sales. Look at the growth in Nike’s online business since pandemic. They ARE a digital company with a huge moat.
03/17/2021,stocks,"You’ve done a lot more research than I have, my idea of their moat is mainly observation. If you look around the sports world, they practically make every major sports jersey in the US. That must pretty be a pretty lucrative business considering they sell for $100+.

They just have a brand awareness that is unmatched. It seems like every athlete is sponsored by Nike, and kids are going to want to wear what their idols are wearing. 

On shoes, you’re probably right since you have the figure to back it up. But it seems like Jordans/Nikes are all the hype in pop culture, just look at all the people profiting from the reselling business. 

Even with all their competitors at various price points, they are still the overall dominant player in the industry. It’s hard for me to see those competitors making significant gains into Nike’s market share due to Nike’s unmatched brand awareness.

With that being said I agree with you that their valuation is too high, I wouldn’t invest in their stock, their P/E is high than growth tech stocks lmao. With Nike’s already dominant market share where can they grow?"

It doesn't necessarily have that ceiling but we have things like March Madness coming up and plenty of more shows coming to PP, you're doing a huge disservice to anyone having them sell. Outside factors will affect all stocks not just Viacom. The fundamentals are this is a highly low risk stock for anyone who bought it a month or so ago."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Yeah. Apple was just a place I wanted to park my money in temporarily, it’s my individual account. My entire 401k/Roth are in s and p and blend accounts."
03/17/2021,stocks,"I mean, the stock price would probably go up obviously. By how much though, like anything with stocks, would be a bit of a guess. If you have the time + are thinking of making a bigger investment you could try to map out the total addressable market of the new drug, forecast how much of that market the drug would take over, forecast a rough estimate of revenues and costs based on that number, and then assess how that revenue stream would affect FCF and resultingly how much the stock price would change.

However, as you can see, this would require making a lot of guesses and assumptions that could easily go wrong quickly."

The post on r/gme insinuating that it had to be because of shorts hurt my brain it was so stupid. Maybe I could be convinced that GME's rise caused the stock market to fall, but if the negative Beta is due to high short interest then why was GME's beta positive as of 12/31/2020? Surely the stock was being massively shorted then as well.

Also how does someone getting a masters in finance not know how to calculate beta? It's just cov(GME,M)/var(M) where M is the stock market."

This’ll prob drag on for years and go nowhere at this point.

If I lose money fuck it, it’s still fun."
03/17/2021,stocks,"It’s very naive at this point to consider talk of a squeeze as non-sense. Most people never expected it to rise again, even those claiming “diamond hands” probably were just holding because of their losses. It made idiots out of everyone by surging again.  Now, I don’t think short interest is the driving force, it’s pretty clear it was ITM call options piggy-backing off of the Ryan Cohen catalyst, but if the catalysts of the lawsuit tomorrow, stimmys, quad-witching, and earnings can push it back to $300 level, it could absolutely take off. Also, if the whales are still attempting to profit off of the retailer hype (seems so with all the volatility), later this week into early next week would be the perfect time to attack.

Will it happen? Who the fuck knows anymore lol? It could drop back down through all of it, but I’m not counting out any of the potential outcomes with this stock up to the $1,000 price. (As most say, that’s unlikely, but it’s not impossible)"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I think there's one thing to this GME thing which is the Gamma Squeeze. Asusming you know how they work, they are what is driving GME up at this point, it could continue if retail investors continue to hype themselves up AND can afford the call option premiums. 

They unfortunately cannot, I think, so the stock will go down, but one thing I am gonna be looking for now is what other stocks are at risk of a gamma squeez because prima facie, that is easy to manufacture than a short squeeze."

03/17/2021,stocks,I’m not encouraging anyone to buy. I just asked what the thoughts were on my potential scenario. People post it all of the time that you should never invest more than what you’re willing to lose. If you decided to disregard your personal risk tolerance in favor of greed that’s on you.
03/17/2021,stocks,You keep talking about hedgies but keep forgetting there are barely any shorts left lol.. Pretty sure that most hedgies don't give a fck about gme
03/17/2021,stocks,From this morning first page compare current stats to 3/14/21
03/17/2021,stocks,"they are borrowing shares to pay down either their SI or shorts or both  T+2 on those.  3.5 million Monday heard 5-6 million today due thursday EOD.  lots of other stuff ratio is -2  inverse to normal screams shorts but not necessarily.  perfect storm stimmys, options, return of shares and earnings they get out of this they are Houdini"
03/17/2021,stocks,"That 115% reflects settled and unsettled/not yet reported new holdings, and therefor is inflated because it’s double counting some cases(counting both the old owner and the new owner), nothing unusual, especially for stocks with a lot of activity, it slowly fizzles out over time to the correct number, [it’s already down to 105%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings).

The big flaw in this guys analysis is that he doesn’t know that reporting of this data is often instant from some, and laggy from others, and they tend to be very unreliable for markets current situation.

I have to mention there’s also short selling, but it’s not as bad as you think, this is not short interest it’s institutional ownership, for example if institutional ownership is 95% of float, then 20% of the float gets shorted, and all the shorts get bought by institutional investors, you get 115% institutional ownership with 20% short interest. Nothing that indicates a short squeeze or ladder attacks, and speaking of ladder attacks, that idiot is saying short ladder attacks are a thing which is unsupported by any real evidence and is unfalsifiable, so I don’t even want to start on but just read [this](https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/), he clearly has no idea what he’s looking at with that terminal. 

There’s a lot of rambling in his comment so if you have more precise questions on his claims feel free to ask"
03/17/2021,stocks,not quite look who the post is from and ask him he posted it on Wallstreetbets
03/17/2021,stocks,"Stop trying to pumping gme so hard cause u're bagholding.
Do you think every institution release every day how much they hold?"

03/17/2021,stocks,They have been ssr for 2 months so limited now.  borrowing off investment firms and brokerages.  T+2 but they give them a couple of days before they fail to deliver.  They do not want to short but borrowing shares makes this come faster.  Like paying your visa with mastercard
03/17/2021,stocks,yes he does state that he's not totally up on the whole process but looking at it even if it is 105% it's a problem for them.  I don't know if a short squeeze is in the works but I think the HF's have a problem getting shares.  If they borrow which coastalhotdog thinks it's a double edged sword.  HF's are so deceitful as they try to hide information  I try to take a little from every post that actually has some dd.  Try to piece it together imo there is so much going on with the HFs that can really hurt them it's getting that everywhere they turn the door gets closed.  Who knows though tricks deceit and lies  whatever it takes for them to win they will do.  Penalties are just a cost of doing business.
03/17/2021,stocks,I think the hope is that there is some kind of announcement on earnings that ignites the fire. Any type of big announcement and a good ER should be able to get the volume pumping again.
03/17/2021,stocks,SSR doesn’t mean much it only means you cannot short below the ask.  This whole fascination with failure to deliver is like Pepe Silva level crap.  Interesting but not a root cause.
03/17/2021,stocks,"The Bloomberg stuff contains old data that has not been updated. It’s still released on current charts because it’s the last data received. 

Look, I own GME stock, so I legitimately hope you’re right. However, the best comparison I can think of (since it’s recent) is the Trump fraud shit. Every bread-crumb is being twisted and amplified like it’s a whole fucking loaf because it reinforces what people want to believe is true. The only way to get the truth is to let it play out. Are HF’s still short? Nobody knows, but too often on WSB I see “yea, the price is falling, it’s being manipulated because they’re still short”. While that is certainly a potential outcome, many things can cause a price to fall, but it is stated as a cold, hard fact as part of their rallying cry.

>	HF's have a problem getting shares

They don’t, high volume = liquid asset. One of the funniest mistake people made on the first run up was not noticing the massive volume that would’ve allowed all the shorts close their positions multiple times in a single day. Short squeeze needs low volume.

Why borrow when they can buy?

And what makes you think that? They’re providing hedging to for their clients. Its a financial service, they’re not trying to fuck people over. It’s 2020 not 1980. Hedge funds don’t work the way you think they do. 

>	Try to piece it together imo there is so much going on with the HFs that can really hurt them it's getting that everywhere they turn the door gets closed

Not really, hedge funds “hedge” every single position they open capping all losses at a level they can handle, and they do so very carefully with entire departments tasked with nothing but risk managing. None of the were ever in trouble, not even Melvin. 

>	Who knows though tricks deceit and lies whatever it takes for them to win they will do. Penalties are just a cost of doing business.

Or they’re just watching a normal mania from the outside with amusement. Trust me I know multiple “hedgies” personally and they all find this whole thing bizarre.

03/17/2021,stocks,"I’m going to summarize my response into “agree to disagree”. These *hedge* funds may exist to hedge their positions to protect their clients investments. Sure, some may, however it has been made abundantly clear just through watching CNBC and the congressional hearing alone that there is clear and obvious “fuckery” happening behind the scenes. 

Sure, some of these funds may have their investors best interests at heart. This isn’t and never has been about the machine that is investment banking. This is about the blatant greed and illegal actions by the GME short sellers that created this entire situation to begin with. Whether or not you agree that the CURRENT short % is high or abnormal, there is little to no doubt that the original intention was to bankrupt a company in order to profit by means of illegal and out of bounds trading practices. 

And for that reason, I hold my 18 hand of blackjack with the dealer showing a 7. It doesn’t really matter if GameStop goes to 0 or 1000, either way my life won’t change.

>	This is about the blatant greed and illegal actions by the GME short sellers that created this entire situation to begin with

What did they do that was illegal and what’s your evidence of it?

>	Whether or not you agree that the CURRENT short % is high or abnormal, there is little to no doubt that the original intention was to bankrupt a company in order to profit by means of illegal and out of bounds trading practices.

High short interest means a lot of people are very sure the company will be bankrupt soon, and there’s a good chance they might be right. 

Can you point out what’s illegal about that? 

There’s this sentiment that shorting bankrupts companies. How would that even work? The only thing is shorting is the ultimate putting your money where your mouth is. When a top hedge fund shorts, people notice, and lose confidence. That has absolutely nothing to do with the companies operations. Maybe their stock price decrease will reduce their buying power through exchange of their own stocks, or their ability to raise money, but I can assure you, if a business’s back breaks from that, they were waist deep in shit already. 

>	And for that reason, I hold my 18 hand of blackjack with the dealer showing a 7. It doesn’t really matter if GameStop goes to 0 or 1000, either way my life won’t change. 

Your life is not gonna change when you continue to make bad decisions, albeit small. 

>	 But to pretend that the funds responsible for this mess are not acting in a way of 80s predatory wallstreet is laughable at best.

Once again I ask you, what have they done that’s bad other than shorting? You know hedge funds are not singular entities right? You know it’s the sum of many of them shorting has put GME where it’s at. They didn’t get together and conspire. They just shorted a stock. I would’ve as well, GME before The new management was a company on the verge of death, shorts or not.


>	I think you give way too much credit to the “rules” and what information you have available to you. If everything was as easy as reading the lines and not between them we’d all be rich.

People break laws all the time no doubt, I’m just saying this whole GME fiasco is not even close to one. I know how funds operate, it’s all math. Complicated, carefully done and audited math and algorithms, done by hundreds of geniuses with decades of industry experience, it’s not illegal shit. The thing is, when you’re sitting on the toilet making decisions based on dumb 1 page DD from wsb by a guy who made his first ever trade a month ago, and you get fucked, off course it’s gonna feel like the game is rigged. Off course it’s gonna feel like a short ladder attack, But that’s all it is, just a feeling. Any mental game you play against a sufficiently skilled opponent feels rigged.

Well turns out youre wrong. Thank God I didn't trust a random  redditor with 7 upvotes with my savings. Lesson learned.

So yeah. A limit sell order does not function at all like a stop loss. Say I bought a stock at 13 dollars. Immediately after, I put in a limit sell order for 12 dollars. The sale does not trigger once the stock falls to 12. A limit sell order will trigger IMMEDIATELY for the best possible price, because like I said, a limit sell triggers only when the market value is above your limit sell price, not under it like a stop loss.

I literally just tested this out to be sure. Bought at $13. Put in a limit sell for 12. It immediately executed my trade at and sold it at 13. Please test it out yourself. 

And please don't give financial advice if you are not certain about things.  Guess it really is rocket science."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Sorry but you’re wrong. The entire purpose of a limit order is to limit the order to the price you enter.

03/17/2021,stocks,"Yes the entire purpose of a limit order is to sell at the designated price ABOVE the current market price. So if I bought at 13 and did a limit sell order for 14, then yes that is how it works. It would trigger once it went from 13 to 14. It does not function like that on the way down however.

I for sure did a limit sell and input 12 dollars as my limit to experiment. not a market order.TD has free trades right? Why not just buy stock and put the limit sell order a couple dollars beneath its current price and see what happens? Might save you some money one day."

Two big data points in addition you didn't mention and a third i'll add  


1. Perceptive Advisors owns 10% and has led Series C/pushed other institutes in here. [https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b19hj4gjrwh1x9/The-41-Man](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b19hj4gjrwh1x9/The-41-Man) Perceptive is THE institute to follow for clinical biotech companies. Almost never seen them be heavily invested in a company that had a clinical binary readout that went poorly.
2. I believe Novartis shut down their gene therapy program for SNHL and so I think there's no real competitors I can see for FREQ in this space.
3. Pricing and market valuation. 500$ is cheap for this. If they get 10% of the US market alone, ie 3M patients, and charge 3k a year for dosing, we're talking 9B in annual recurring revenue. That's not even including the royalties received for ex-US rights. A valuation on just 9B in sales is around 27B market cap, which is roughly 20x today's Share Price.
4. Unlikely to see dilution here, between 200M cash on hand, and 90-250M in additional milestone payments soon as they dose ph2b/ph3, these guys are set up very well to pursue all their pipelines, commercialize, start up MS, and do more"
03/17/2021,stocks,Outstanding post. I've been invested in FREQ for over a year. Bullish for sure. It makes up 10% of my portfolio and I'm thrilled to be on board.
03/17/2021,stocks,"Thank you very much for the kind words. All your points are excellent and only strengthen my own convictions!

Question for you: do you think FREQ would pursue manufacturing themselves in the US or would your money be on them partnering up with someone locally as part of a licensing deal? The fact they retained US rights in the first place would suggest to me they are confident they can do this themselves and if I remember correctly, their small-molecule approach means it should be easy to produce.

One concern I have read (in the event it does go to market) is that suppliers (ENTs/Otolaryngologists) will not match the sheer scale of demand and that there will need to be a lot of training of doctors in the intratympanic procedure. Others have countered this by saying that we may end up with dedicated treatment centres - think LASIK eye surgery. What are your thoughts on this?

PS. I've already read your VBIV write-up and taken a long position \*cough/wink\*"
03/17/2021,stocks,"Never go by Share Price, go by market cap. It's what matters to asses valuation"
03/17/2021,stocks,"I honestly think they should pursue this themselves, or at minimum wait to license til they get to approval to maximize the value of any license deal they make. Like I mentioned, even at a very nominal cost, the sheer demand for a treatment like this means billions of dollars. Manufacturing millions of doses annually is something I'm unsure the difficulty, but between companies like https://resilience.com/team/ and all the emphasis on bio manufacturing, I think they have plenty of options if they search. Sales and commercialization usually is a problem with negotiating regulator approvals, reimbursement, and various other aspects of a sales and marketing team.

If this treatment goes to market, Astellas takes care ex-US so they only have to worry about US FDA regulator. Sales and marketing will be easy in my opinion so long as the financial model meets the ENT/audiologist incentive of making more money (which I believe it does). Soon as there's a treatment that is a minor procedure to improve your hearing, it'll sell itself in my opinion.

And small molecule manufacturing is much cheaper and easier to scale then complex large molecules.

Hence I imagine they will tackle this themselves, or get a bidding war going because whoever gets the rights to this treatment if the ph2a and ph1b results are positive, will easily make tens of billions of dollars of pure profit in a decade. Just offering it once to everybody in the US for 5k is equivalent to 150B dollars of cash flow.

A license deal for US rights is easily worth 1-2 billion up front with 10-20B in milestones in my opinion (all depending how good the data is and how far they get in clinical development)

Given the next step after the current ph1b and ph2a trials is likely a registrational they will do in 2022, I feel good odds they will run the trial, get the data demonstrating all populations benefit, and then either just print money (and I draw a parallel here of VRTX which did what FREQ is doing for hearing, to Cystic Fibrosis and prints 8-10B in sales annually and has a 50B market cap purely off of that single asset monopoly).

The difference is PCA can be used for so much more and hence I think if FREQ plays their cards right, they can easily become a BP giant. Long as they don't give up the goods too early."
03/17/2021,stocks,"On the topic of specific training etc. I really doubt you'll find these as real issues, in the sense there will be operational and logistical challenges, but between all the hearing loss foundations, ENT/audiology conferences, academic and industry both, I think this would get rapid adoption as they mention with LASIK eye surgery. The delta I think is that this procedure is much simpler far as I can tell compared to how invasive and heavy LASIK eye surgery feels."

Do you mind also explaining how you reached 27B market cap based on 9B in revenue? I presume you're using a times-revenue method but just trying to understand why you came to a multiplier of 3x."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Most biotechs assume 3x Price to sales ratio, ie three years of sales cash flow is priced into valuation. For a monopoly, like VRTX, you can actually price this in to the end of patent life. it's actually possible such a scenario occurs for FREQ eventually

VRTX for example I believe has like 6-8B sales annually from CF franchise, and is valued at 54B, ie, 7-9x price to sales because the sales prices in future years as well since there's no threat of erosion or losing market share at all.

I don't always understand the chart reading but the articles have a pretty good way of breaking them down. HOw accurate are they? well....I mean it just depends on any finance article. Some people prefer morning star and some prefer motely fool. I do feel based on past research they have present accurate information. A few months ago I thought about buying abercrombie stock because yahoo said it was undervalued and it had gone up a good percentage from last year, but for whatever reason I didn't buy into and now the stock has rose and it's probably too late to buy."

03/17/2021,stocks,"Think about your question: Are you asking in which scenario Tech won't keep growing, or are you asking in which scenario tech stocks won't keep growing? It is entirely possible for the tech sector to continue to grow even as tech stocks decline in value. At current valuation levels, either technology companies sales and earnings must skyrocket over the next 24 months, or the company stock prices must fall to meet a more realistic level of earnings growth. How much are you willing to pay for future earnings and how long are you willing to wait for companies' stock prices to reach that level of earnings?"

03/17/2021,stocks,why
03/17/2021,stocks,The price went from $1 to $483
03/17/2021,stocks,But they wouldn’t want to cover that high. Also what’s with the short interest/amount? It’s always wrong seemingly but what’s the most reliable info to go by?
03/17/2021,stocks,I’m saying the shorts covering is what sent the price from 1 to 483$ last 18 months
03/17/2021,stocks,It certainly didn’t get that high because of GameStop’s massive profits lol
03/17/2021,stocks,I guess. But do  you think they are done covering? As in the number of shorted shares are way lower now? I see so many numbers but dont' know if any are accurate even if they are reliable sources.
03/17/2021,stocks,Think it could keep going up? It's hard to tell if it is hype trading or if there are still fundamentals at play from shorts
03/17/2021,stocks,"When reading about total short shares, we don’t know where those shorts are. I’m sure a lot of them started shorting at much higher values once it squeezed in January. So there could be a high short interest....but if they all got in @ 250+ it’ll be hard for retail to muster enough buying pressure to cause a squeeze."

I don't need to ""answer your questions"" because it's clear by your response you've decided you know more about Roblox than you actually do and I can only assume that's due to a lack of due diligence. I'm not going to spell it out for you since you can download the app, and cruise the forums yourself and then maybe you will have come to a different conclusion. Maybe in a year from now the hype will be gone and I will have made only a little money instead of a lot but if Roblox lives on... well then I have a good feeling about it's future valuations."

I don't think we will ever go back to the lifestyle after the pandemic. Pandemic caused a disaster, but also changed a lot of aspects of the life creating a lot of business that makes the life easier. This trend will not die, but it is the new chapter into the new generation of the retail industry."
03/17/2021,stocks,"Market saturation is the way for CPNG to go. There are still a lot of room for coupang to steal from its competitors. It only holds around 20% whereas Amazon 40%, meaning it has chance to double up their market share at this moment!! And they already branched in to food delivery (coupang eats seems to establish business across the whole nation, they recently started delivery service even in Jeju island, the farthest territory from the city of Seoul.) and OTT. And independent sellers are flocking to coupang platform to sell their products. I believe that coupang will expand their seller support business, just like Amazon supported their sellers before. It will eventually expand its business out of Korea, by merging other e-commerce giants abroad! Like Amazon acquired [souq.com](https://souq.com) and BABA bought out [Lazada.com](https://Lazada.com), it will acquire some cash cow business. As there is also an unstoppable trend that Korean companies started executing international M&A, CPNG will definitely participate."

03/17/2021,stocks,Thoughts on iShares Global Clean ($ICLN)? Since we were talking about ETFs and what not.v
03/17/2021,stocks,"I have looked into ICLN somewhat, but not fully. Whilst I think that sustainable, clean energy is a no-brainer, going forward, I still think it's a bit of a risky play unless you are in it for the long haul (30-50 years).

There are still so many powers at work all around the world who are not onboard, my country (Australia) being one of them. Our Prime Minister (and government) are in bed with the coal mining industry and seem to be doing everything in their power to slow the clean energy boom.

Also, if you look at the growth of ICLN over the last 5 years, it has been climbing, but VERY slowly. Then in the last year, it shot up a ridiculous amount, and it now seems to be in the process of correcting itself, on a big downtrend.

I would say that there has been a lot that's happened in the past year that has made people think more about clean, sustainable energy, which would explain the huge, sudden growth.

In my personal opinion, I can see it correcting back down to the $15-$17 point, and then continuing its very slow growth over the next 5-10 years, at which point I think clean energy will really start to boom, and by then, who knows how many other big players will be in the arena?

So I personally wouldn't buy at this price, as it might take you 5 or so years to break even, on the hopes that we see another boom relatively soon.

So for me, the only real reason to consider ICLN at this point would be for long-term (retirement) growth, but in that case, there are many other investments that will see a higher return in the same amount of time. But, if you believe it's the future and can see some real growth and/or another boom, then go for gold! I'm not a financial advisor, IDK WTF is going to happen!"

03/17/2021,stocks,"I realize I’m a week late, but I’m not sure why you’d want to exit your position now. The recovery is only just beginning, and USO has never been below $70 per share in the history of the ETF prior to the pandemic. In the past 5 years it’s hovered around $100, so even with USO at $44, I can’t see why it won’t continue to climb. I’m thinking of opening a long position as we speak, and came here looking for reasons not to. Having trouble finding one."
