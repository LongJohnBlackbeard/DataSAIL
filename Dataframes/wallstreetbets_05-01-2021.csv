2021-05-01 17:12:45,wallstreetbets,"> Elon Musk is sort of into space tourism as well, although I can't tell if they are officially selling tickets yet. Please feel free to put any updates in the comments.

Yes, Elon Musk / SpaceX is definitely into space tourism.  But SpaceX is in a totally different league than Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin.

VG and BO both offer **suborbital** joyrides--  Bring you to about 80-100km altitude and float down to experience a few minutes of zero-g.  VG and BO's rockets are not fast enough to reach orbit--  Just 1.0 km/s vs. 9.3 km/s for an orbital rocket like the SpaceX Falcon 9.

SpaceX offers **orbital** tourism in 2 different flavors:

1)  Launch you into low-earth orbit for 2-3 days in a Crew Dragon capsule.  This is the tourist ticket Shift4 Payments chairman Jared Isaacman bought, for himself and 3 other tourists.  Price undisclosed, but rumored to be about $220 million for the flight, and they will fly in September this year.  The space tourism company Space Adventures has also bought a Falcon 9 / Crew Dragon tourist flight like this one.

2) Launch on Falcon 9 / Crew Dragon to visit the ISS for a week.  This is what Axiom Space bought from SpaceX--  The Ax-1 mission is all set for next spring, with 1 professional astronaut and 3 millionaire tourists.  Tom Cruise also signed up for a later Axiom-brokered SpaceX Crew Dragon flight to the ISS.

The only competitor to SpaceX in the orbital tourism market right now is Roscosmos, with their Soyuz rocket/capsule.  They are also resuming selling Soyuz seats to tourists to visit the ISS for a week, about $40-some million per seat."
2021-05-01 16:22:53,wallstreetbets,"It just depends on how you look at it, will they fly successfully in May with zero hiccups? If so stock takes off and never comes back down because they'll fly a rehearsal flight, and again with Branson. 

I'm betting they do. They said the EMI issue that interrupted ignition was from upgrades to the horizontal stabilizer and they bench tested and fixed it. 

They've struggled with organization over the years but I think we might finally be towards the finish line.

2021-05-01 16:20:28,wallstreetbets,"I made the mistake of not selling when the hype was high and the next test flight was going to take place. Then they rescheduled, the market became a bloodbath and with that combination my massive profit took a big hit and ended up selling at $27 to make some money (had an average of $20) .Also because I am new to stocks and got scared when such a high profitable stock I had began to shrink. 


Anyway..I'm in again with $30 and the reason for it being that should they announce the new test flight hopefully this month as promised will jump to at least $35. The reality is ,that if they finally have a successful flight the stock will explode"

- Jared Isaacman's space flight is this September.  https://inspiration4.com/

- Axiom's Ax-1 tourist flight to the ISS is next Spring (2022):  https://www.axiomspace.com/ax1

The Space Adventures flight has been purchased, now they are filling the seats.  Date and identity of the tourists TBA.

Tom Cruise's participation for an Axiom flight (date TBA, likely in 2023) was announced by then-NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine last year:   https://twitter.com/JimBridenstine/status/1257752395750289409"
2021-05-01 17:01:10,wallstreetbets,"Elon won't take SpaceX public because shareholders would demand he abandon Mars and devote the company to milking the military-industrial complex for profit. Starlink may well go public to raise cash for that endeavor. 

The future of the space business is not the next SpaceX coming along; its what can be done with the insane capability SpaceX can offer through Starship. Each launch has about 2/3 the payload of a Saturn V; but Musk is talking about turning it around in an hour. Even taking into account time on orbit, and getting back over the landing site, this is 2-3 launches per day. Nothing will be the same again, and nobody will buy tiny, expensive suborbital hybrid rocket trips."
2021-05-01 16:37:11,wallstreetbets,"Read the blog; the point is that SpaceX will be able to offer orbital - and even lunar orbital - tourism for a lower price. VG will give you 15 mins of weightlessness in the volume of a large SUV, SpaceX can give you a week in space, swinging round the Moon and seeing an Earth rise, whilst getting to play around in a volume comparable to Skylab. For less money. The window of opportunity for suborbital hybrid rockets to become commercial is almost closed, and VG have just been too slow"
2021-05-01 17:27:13,wallstreetbets,Earnings?  What earnings?
2021-05-01 17:33:39,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm hoping for one. Thank you for the advice!!
2021-05-01 19:28:43,wallstreetbets,How are you posting DD on here and not know this
2021-05-01 17:02:26,wallstreetbets,"No, SpaceX isn't doing suborbital tourism. They are doing orbital tourism for less money with bigger spacecraft."
2021-05-01 18:08:07,wallstreetbets,"So still one offs, and more likely based on availability. I think VG differentiation is that (if the plan works) they will have weekly flights and already have 250 confirmed passengers, giving them enough customers for the first 12-18 months.....somewhat apples and oranges, but good to know"
2021-05-01 17:37:00,wallstreetbets,"WoW good to know, Definitely would be an awesome thing to see that short of a turn around. I‚Äôve worked on military fighter jets and you worked your butt off if you have a short turn around to get it ready for its next flight."
2021-05-01 16:46:59,wallstreetbets,"I agree starship is more efficient and profitable and has more capabilities. 

But like I said, in your article the ""first #dearmoon customer is 2023, likely 2024 with delays""

The window is closing but both VG and BO expect to start next year. 

Another variable, when Starship is certified, will commercial human flight be its first and primary function and in what capacity? Same point of departure, point to point travel, ISS tourism, a week in orbit, or taking people to mars?

Depending on the answer there will likely be room for all three companies to be profitable."
2021-05-01 19:13:53,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me retard, this is wallstreetbets"
2021-05-01 19:23:29,wallstreetbets,"That's VG's plans yes.  The bald supervillain who runs Amazon is going to take a large chunk of VG's market share though.  Jeff Bezos' main selling points are:

1) The New Shepard goes higher than SpaceShipIII.  100km+ altitude vs. 80+ km or so.  The significance is that 100km is the ""Karman Line"" which is what FAI recognizes as ""outer space"" and might be worth a premium to some rich folks:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K√°rm√°n_line

2) Jeff Bezos likes to point out New Shepard has much larger windows than SpaceshipIII.

3) Blue Origin may very well be the first to fly paid suborbital passengers.  Some rich folks might pay a premium for that distinction.

How much SPCE should be valued at I think depends on how big a market share BO will take from them if BO achieves first mover advantage.  If BO is operational months before VG, they are going to grab the early high-net-worth customers and hog the publicity (Jeff Bezos would take a page out of Richard Branson's playbook here and upstage his rival)."
2021-05-01 16:55:15,wallstreetbets,"Its capabilities are so far ahead of, well, anything that its entirely disruptive. They put a bid in to launch 50kg worth of cubesats for NASA on it - bear in mind its payload to orbit is in the region of 100,000kg - and still managed to undercut one of the other bidders on cost. 

Outside the community of 'Texas tank watchers' who track every development at their launch site in Boca Chica, most people aren't that aware of how fast SpaceX is moving or will move. Because Starship is fully reusable, once they start getting them back intact that can launch them very rapidly, because they aren't limited by manufacturing an expendable part as the Shuttle was and Falcon 9 is. They can rack up flights quickly enough to get it human rated even before DearMoon flies.

Investment wise, I think putting your money in any SpaceX competitor (with the possible exception of RocketLab who are in the process of merging with a SPAC) is a bad choice. Look for customers of SpaceX, who will do well - Axiom is likely to have an IPO in the future, for instance."
2021-05-01 17:11:40,wallstreetbets,"I know where you're coming from, and I understand that is a possibility but still not certain. 

My personal belief is simple: 

VG will fly in May and passengers in 2022. 

Starship will get human rated by 2023, but will most likely serve a different type of space travel. 

I think VG same point of departure space ride can co-exist with long orbits with SpaceX or point to point travel, or trips to the ISS. They offer different experiences. 

Bottom line, what we're talking about is far ahead and everyone here including the market is only looking at SPCE movement for the next couple months. 

Also, I have rocketlab as well and although they are far behind SpaceX in cabability, they will still coexist even in the same market."
2021-05-01 19:11:20,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me retard this is wallstreetbets, no one wants investment advice"
2021-05-01 19:32:27,wallstreetbets,"If Elon Musk actually gets the regulatory authorities to allow Starship to fly point-to-point suborbital trips such as New York to London, SpaceX may very well decimate both SPCE and BO's suborbital tourism businesses.

Starship on its own, without the Superheavy booster, is being designed to have a suborbital hop range of 6000 miles / 10,000 kilometers.  New York to London in 30 minutes.

I think this won't happen for at least 7 or 8 years though.  The regulatory hurdles are quite difficult to overcome.  It probably will happen in the future (betting against Elon is a sucker's game), but probably will take longer than Elon aims for (he readily admits his timeline goals are aspirational).

So I'm guessing 7-8 years for Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin to operate as a duopoly in the suborbital tourism business."

Her parents all fucking democrats

Current US govt run by democrats

It's not before long they get their agenda through

Chamath is a venture capitalist, he's a smart guy, linking up with political ties for a company like this
Sounds shady but it's really smart imho

Political ties and rich people will eventually try and take the lion share in the market over time, give Clover sometime and you'll see where they'll be at

They'll just throw that hidenburg report out the window and SEC gon a clear them in a matter of time, in pretty confident of that

2021-05-01 16:18:16,wallstreetbets,Serverless has been around for ages and pretty much nobody uses it.  Turns out it actually sucks.  I've tried converting some of my company's services to both AWS Lambda and Azure Functions.  They are just all garbage.
2021-05-01 16:20:37,wallstreetbets," 

TL;DR Investing in some form of serverless computing is a good idea.

You may have noticed that I did not discuss financials. This is mostly because these details do not nearly weigh as much as the general understanding of the product, which is content-delivery and serverless computing. In my view, the economic consequence of these architectures far outweighs any other metric that could measure the future value of a company like Fastly.

So you don't know what they're worth but it's a good investment anyways? mahh boiii wikkked smaaht"

2021-05-01 16:28:43,wallstreetbets,"Serverless like cloud is just someone elses computer.  I wouldn't say it's garbage, but even when used correctly, it's mostly much more expensive then expected.

the previous DD that was deleted by the mods tried to compare cloudflare to the market cap of amazon (due to AWS) based on DNS services, which neither companies have ever cared about.

while both mentioned companies are doing ok in their field, there is no expected boom in their business expected.

It always seems to move up enough to get $200 fish biting at some point during the week. I've done it 4 weeks in a row and obviously not been assigned once.

2021-05-01 19:28:52,wallstreetbets,"Here's a question that might keep intelligent GME holders up at night.  How many apes don't actually have ""diamond hands"" but are made up of a lot of CC writers?

If IV realllly goes down.  To the point that blue chip stocks start to become real alternatives, and there is a mass exodus.  What happens then?"
2021-05-01 16:00:14,wallstreetbets,I wish I had learned of this strategy a long time ago.
2021-05-01 15:26:52,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm legit smooth brained.  I don‚Äôt know how to do that.
2021-05-01 14:52:50,wallstreetbets,"Did you make $65,641.73 in a month or till date from selling GME calls & puts"
2021-05-01 18:06:50,wallstreetbets,"Generally, covered calls of assets with a low risk of tanking do not have high IV for precisely this reason.  I wouldn't call it ""extremely low risk"".  That is highly misleading.  Covered call ETF's exist and they plummet just like the QQQ's.  Here's an example QYLD.

To make CC's worth it, you need to believe pretty strongly in 2 things.

1.  GME cannot reasonably tank substantially in value.
2.  GME won't make serious gains either, since you're selling upside.

Edit: if you think CC strats are amazing, look at QYLD and the Nasdaq 100.  QYLD got fucked with the drop in February but didn't get any of the huge recovery gains and way underperforms.  In fact most of the time buy/write strats underperform the underlying assets.  In return they provide consistent income streams.  It's not a tradeoff too different from dividend stock strategies."
2021-05-01 18:27:51,wallstreetbets,Covered calls are less risk than owning the shares outright. But don't confuse that with low risk. Owning GME is high risk.

2021-05-01 15:28:34,wallstreetbets,"If GME suddenly imploded back to $40 a share then I'd be holding a sizable bag. It seems more likely to slowly bleed out, which would give me some time to pull the eject handle."

My big regret is only buying 100 shares when it was around $120 to sell covered calls. I've been resisting buying more but I'll probably bite the bullet and some more next week to keep it rolling."

2021-05-01 19:45:55,wallstreetbets,"You joke but every inflated asset that pops, people think ""no one else will sell.""  Until they do and SHTF fast.

Sometimes the initial sell-off isn't a lack of faith in the underlying asset.  Black swans come in many forms.  Example: say GME ""apes"" are mostly millenials.  Home prices bottom out for whatever reason and a rush to buy first homes leads to a 50% reduction in their vast GME holdings.

Another example: Archegos 2.0 holding lots of GME is forced into liquidation and block trades.  This is the catalyst leading to the first wave of sell-offs.  This causes panic and CC writers, who obviously are selling CC's because they don't really believe in the upside (if they believed in the squeeze they wouldn't sell CC's), are the 2nd wave, then the weakest of the apes next wave 3, and dominos are rolling."

2021-05-01 16:05:30,wallstreetbets,"No $200, lol. They were $100 each at first, but I've averaged them down to $85. I'm a little down on them currently but not too concerned. I wanted something relatively safe since I lost a bundle on GME early on shorting it."
2021-05-01 16:10:39,wallstreetbets,"Fundamentals. I'm a hard core gamer. Brick and mortar stores make no sense in this day and age because I can download games from the Playstation store, steam, etc, etc, super easy. I don't even want to deal with changing disks its a headache. The used game market made up half of their historic profit and that is phasing out quickly since no one deals with disks anymore. Console sales are great but really low profit margin. Big picture gaming isn't pet food lol.

It's a healthy but declining business with $500m on the books and I think it will be around in 5 years just with fewer stores and more online stuff. But it's not a $12b dollar company. Maybe $2b IMHO.

What's going to happen (I hope later rather than sooner) is that people are going to realize that there isn't a mother of all short squeezes coming. This is just another over priced hyped stock. And they will slowly peel away for the next big thing. The amount of emotional energy many are putting in to this isn't sustainable long term."

2021-05-01 13:25:57,wallstreetbets,Many thanks. I'll be diving into it later. Might grab some calls.

I'm really not sure of anyone who does outside of a silver ring on their finger or a necklace. I'm not even sure there is a market for silver. Is it even used for anything in 2021 or do they just keep pulling it out of the ground and making it into bars and claiming it's valuable? I googled it's uses and all I could find is idiots drinking it like medicine because they are desperate and will try anything.

Edit: There are 0.034 grams of gold and even less silver in each cell phone, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

An average¬†solar panel¬†uses some 20 grams.

I cannot find an exact amount in a computer because it is so little that it is insignificant.

Not enough to create a silver rush."
2021-05-01 12:21:19,wallstreetbets,PSLV is stacking real silver as opposed to SLV which is paper silver. The world is starting to realise the difference

2021-05-01 17:08:11,wallstreetbets,"It has the lowest resistance to electrical flow of any pure material at room temperature. It's also used as solder. It has a few niche uses, but not really enough to justify a squeeze."

2021-05-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$NNDM - May literally 3D Print Solid Returns Nano Dimension $NNDM

Company Description (From their website)

Nano Dimension Ltd. engages in the provision of intelligent machines for the fabrication of additively manufactured electronics. Its products and services include DragonFly Pro System, conductive and insulating inks for printed electronics, and optimized multi-material design of complex electronics.

**Sounds cool, doesn't it?** Anyways, here's some information on the company and some short term catalysts.

**Where They Can Sell**

In several investor phone calls the past few months by CEO Yoav Stern, he has stated SEVERAL times that the companies deals with companies in the Defense sector. What they produce with these machines (3d printed ELECTRONIC devices) can be used in many various sectors, like defense, medical, aerospace, etc. Most recently, in March, a RF circuit board printed by them was sent to the International Space Station.

**Cathie Wood**

She is obsessed with Nano Dimension. Nano Dimension is in FOUR Ark ETFS. (\* as of 4/30/21) Over 16 million shares she owns.

ARKQ (8,425,766 Shares)

ARKW (5,383,591 Shares)

IZRL (789,242 Shares)

PRNT (1,934,283 Shares)

**Revenue**

It's a speculative stock as of now, so the numbers are not very pleasing.

In 2020, their total revenue was just $3.4 million, with $48.49 million in losses.

In pre-covid times, 2019, their revenue was $7 million. Flash forward two years, with a bunch of cash on hand (explained below) and hopefully as COVID subsides, I'm expecting to see higher revenues and hopefully in a few years positive earnings.

\*As stated on their earnings call, no guidance was given\*

**Cash on hand**

Every time the stock spiked, they did an offering. Their most recent offering, on February 16th was for $12.80. And it raised $500 MILLION. As of two weeks ago, they had just about $1.5 BILLION cash on hand. After two acquisitions already (explained below), they have just under $1.4 BILLION

(Yes, that means a bunch of people bought shares at high prices and you can buy it now cheaper then they did)

Yes, stock offerings are not good but Yoav Stern (CEO) made it very clear on the investors phone call they hosted last week that they have enough cash on hand to do what they envision, and no more share offerings will happen.

To put this into perspective, they have $1.4 billion in cash. their market cap as of today is just under 2 billion. Roughly, their current cash values them alone at around $6 a share. This doesn't include patents they own, the newly acquired companies, their technology, and just the valuation itself.

**Acquisitions**

The company plans to use its money on acquiring companies (No, $NNDM is NOT a SPAC)

So far, they've acquired two companies in the past two weeks (and these are very tiny acquisitions, bigger ones are expected)

DeepCube (AI Company - their technology will be used in the currently DragonFly Machine) ($70 Million TOTAL - 40 Million Cash / 30 Million Shares)

NanoFabrica (3D Printing - \*the company had a investment lead by Microsoft) (\~$59 Million TOTAL - \~$27 Million Cash / 32 Million Shares) \*The final numbers are not confirmed\*

So they've only burned through roughly $70 million. They still have around $1.4 Billion.

Their plan is to acquire companies listed as Type A, Type B, and Type C.

Type A - Existing companies in PCB business. Companies with revenue between 40-150 million!

Type B - Technologies they think their machines need

Type C - Companies that have machines that cater to the same customers that Nano Dimension does. Literally buying their competition and expanding their customer base.

**Unusual Option Activity**

Specifically, for short term options, there is high open interest on 3 strike call prices.

May 21st Options (\*As of 4/30/21)

$7.50 - 35,197 Open Interest

$10.00 - 35,875 Open Interest

$12.50 - 22,308 Open Interest

Should also be mentioned the activity on the Puts.

$7.50 PUT - 20,552 Open Interest

**Stock Activity**

I'm not much of a stock chart analyst, and I don't think ""technicals"" matter for a stock like this. If you take a look at the YTD chart, it's pretty ugly. Ever since February, $NNDM and plenty of other ""growth"" stocks have been hit hard. After a high of $17.89, it's fallen as low as the low $6.00 range. 

**Upcoming Catalysts** 

* Earnings are expected to be around mid-may. Last earnings, despite low numbers (for this stock revenue isn't that important yet) the stock ran up from mid $6 range to over $11 in under 2 weeks.
* According to the CEO, they have a NEW DragonFly they are expecting to release by summer time.
* Any further acquisitions (Already had 2 the past 2 weeks)

**Two Good Articles Worth Reading**

A very bullish article was posted to Yahoo Finance last week on Nano Dimension, and it's worth the read.

([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-company-pioneering-breakthrough-technology-165540025.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-company-pioneering-breakthrough-technology-165540025.html))

*""This is a $1.8 billion company. The PCB market is marching towards $70-plus billion in value. Nano Dimension is sitting on a breakthrough technology that could disrupt that entire market.*

*Long term, you‚Äôre talking a potentially multi-billion-dollar revenue opportunity, the likes of which could easily result in a $10-plus billion valuation‚Ä¶""*

Cathie Wood actually briefly mentioned Nano Dimension during an interview.

([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-shares-thoughts-nano-122015778.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-shares-thoughts-nano-122015778.html))

*A key quote from her is ""We always look for where the defense is putting their money""*

**The Negatives**

* The company has a rather high short interest (many websites are giving different numbers, but according to FinViz it is around 38%) 
* The company isn't producing high revenues, and its burning cash
* COVID is still impacting Europe, and they have a decent customer base out there

**Positions**

620 Shares - $10.85 average.

May 21st $10 Calls

2021-05-01 15:37:08,wallstreetbets,"I'm in huge here. Only a matter of time until it takes off again. The trickle of acquisitions makes for a drumbeat of catalysts for the next few months/year as covid subsides. Plus as acquisitions occur, Yoav's vision for the company's future will come into focus. Crazy bullish."
2021-05-01 13:52:39,wallstreetbets,Printing in progress
2021-05-01 19:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Ive been in Long with them for a little over 1 year now and I love what I've been reading on them this whole time...its def a long play and Im fine with that ,  earnings is around 2 weeks away and its probably going to be a blood bath so Ill drop my position and when it dips after earnings Ill buy back up heavy and hold"
2021-05-01 14:12:26,wallstreetbets,"*""We  are  a  development-stage  company  and  have  a  limited  operating  history  on  which  to  assess  the  prospects  for  our  business,  haveincurred  losses  since  the  date  of  inception  of  Nano  Dimension  Technologies  Ltd.,  and  anticipate  that  we  will  continue  to  incur  significant losses until we are able to successfully commercialize our products;
We have generated limited revenues from the sale of our current products and may never be profitable.""*

Always reassuring to see that on their financial report."
2021-05-01 13:33:44,wallstreetbets,Wait. I thought high short interest was a positive.
2021-05-01 15:25:49,wallstreetbets,the negatives are the 10 dilution they did in a couple of months...
2021-05-01 19:00:16,wallstreetbets,Same. I believe in this company. It's a growing sector. Huge upside
2021-05-01 14:26:20,wallstreetbets,"It's standard on financial reports of companies that still need to commercialise their products. Unless you sell the equivalent of sliced bread, your company will have had this on their reports at some point. The problem for NNDM is whether or not they can scale up sales/suck in capital quickly enough to become profitable before their current reserves have melted."
2021-05-01 13:57:35,wallstreetbets,Why would that be a positive.  People are betting their own money that the company will lose value.
2021-05-01 13:52:51,wallstreetbets,Yes but no. When the stock spiked to $9 the past week it fell right back to $7 by end of week. The shorts are currently in control
2021-05-01 15:38:28,wallstreetbets,And they're now done and have 1.5 billion cash on hand.
2021-05-01 17:06:50,wallstreetbets,"This ""ShORT SqUeEzE"" shit is getting out of hand.  Its nice to have so many new people on wsb, but it also sucks to have so many new people on wsb.  They all think there is going to be a new short squeeze every week and dont consider the reason for a stock being shorted.  They have no clue how the market works but get one lucky option play and act like they're investing veterans."
2021-05-01 14:55:53,wallstreetbets,Squeeze potential.
2021-05-01 15:47:01,wallstreetbets,"well i guess my point is that they cannot be trusted at all at this point, whats to stop them from another 5 dilutions in the next few weeks.."
2021-05-01 15:30:23,wallstreetbets,Short squeezes are incredibly rare and require very specific circumstances.  Stop trying to make short squeezes a thing.  A highly shorted stock is shorted for a reason
2021-05-01 19:20:18,wallstreetbets,"I guess u don't follow them,  Yoav said no more offerings."
2021-05-01 17:19:45,wallstreetbets,"Short squeezes are great for pump and dumps. Look at MVIS. Price rocketed in a few days, shorts covered, then the shorted the shit out of it again along with profit taking and it drilled. Fortunately I was in early and wasn‚Äôt bag holding, but a lot were. A heavily shorted stock can result in a squeeze if planets align, but the shorts will double down and long term, you lose."
2021-05-01 16:06:32,wallstreetbets,"Well, insane squeezes might be rare, but i think high short interest does still influence the price quite a bit. Look at TSLA yesterday, the short interest has been building up over the past 6 weeks, it kinda seems like the friday pump was a result of some shorts covering quickly before the next short disclosure. 

But yeah the new trend of thinking everything shorted is gonna squeeze is fucked up"
2021-05-01 15:36:44,wallstreetbets,"Even a negative SI stock can SS nowadays, u new here?"
2021-05-01 15:39:45,wallstreetbets,"Well, I am a mod.  So no.  Are **you** new here?  You sound like an ape."

2021-05-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I analyze mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/tymisf4seiw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa1cef4c9a92f4863d89db376e4b86acf9380c9

 Microvision has overtaken GME to become the most discussed stock. This is the first time since Jan‚Äô21 that any stock has overtaken GME in the number of mentions (Not even the $100B Coinbase IPO could do it). Clover health has fallen from 3rd position last week to 7th this week. Coinbase also dropped out of the top 10 and is now in the 12th position. All the others are the usual stocks in the top 10 list except for Microsoft. They booked their biggest revenue growth since 2018 but down 3%+ after hours. 

 **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** 

https://preview.redd.it/obttnaoueiw61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e0b1a918c030d69646aa7f4915def8c13f1007

 Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**MicroVision ($MVIS)** has been trending for the last two weeks. To say that the stock had a wild ride for the last 2 weeks would be an understatement. The stock went from having less than 500 mentions to more than 15,000 mentions in the last 2 weeks. The sentiment has also been affected by the recent drop going from 24% last week to 15% this week.

**Globalstar ($GSAT)** is a Mobile satellite service company incorporating themselves into many new areas. GSAT was up 50% on Monday causing the spike in chatter. There has been a lot of discussion on the company trading at a value less than what their satellites currently in orbit are worth.

**Nokia($NOK)** has beaten all expectations in earnings report and the stock jumped 11%. Their net profit increased more than 11-fold to 375 million euros ($455 million) which was well above analysts' estimates for adjusted profit of 90 million euros. The extremely bullish outlook is also reflected in the sentiment figures.

**Ocugen($OCGN)** was trending mainly due to their partnership with an Indian firm ‚Äì Bharat Biotech which produces Covaxin. The vaccine was found to neutralize a new type of Covid-19 variant and Dr. Fauci has said that this might be very important against the current pandemic. Ocugen is planning to bring this COVID-19 vaccine to the US, pending FDA authorization.

**Amazon($AMZN)** was generating discussions due to its pending earnings report. There was a lot of speculative talk about a stock split. But they delivered beats on overall revenue and AWS revenue and far exceeded EPS estimate for Q1 2021.

**SOME FAQ‚Äôs:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Can I use the code/is it open source: Yes.

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

2021-05-01 09:53:34,wallstreetbets,"The reason Microvision overtook GME is because GME is/was getting censored. Other than that great post, take the upvote retard."

2021-05-01 15:05:29,wallstreetbets,"protip: Whenever someone is complaining that we're *censoring* their stock, check their comment history to see if they contribute to any of the single-stock subs. Almost 100% of the time you'll find they have hundreds of comments in one of those subs and see everything around them that isn't 100% heralding that stock as the second coming of jesus as a conspiracy theory.

Stocks are not sports teams. Not every rumor you read in a comment is true. It would take you like one minute to look around with critical thinking engaged and see that we're not *censoring* GME or whatever other stock you're obsessed with."

2021-05-01 17:18:38,wallstreetbets,"As someone who works in Wall Street, I can tell you hedge funds are nowhere near the top dogs on the street. While most institutional investors are certainly paying attention to the price movements influenced by retail, none of the big players in PE or IB are terribly worried. I understand framing it as a play against hedge funds in particular but as an upfront to the whole of Wall Street is a tad far fetched.

As for pricing pressure on this stock in particular, to be fair, I am not well versed in this company but I think playing off momentum as you seem to be doing (focusing in on buy/sell ratio) is risky at this price point. If you got in early, congrats. I mean that genuinely, the market is rigged against small players and I am always happy when the little guy wins. But at a certain point, you have to learn to take profits and move on.

I'm a fan of the GME phenomenon but not at the expense of shutting down other members of this sub who have genuinely interesting plays in the market. Whether they win or they lose - there is always something to learn. But this hyper focus on GME is coming at the expense of opportunities for learning and investment for all other members.

\*Also assuming you're Indian, my thoughts and prayers to your family in these times. I'm Indian as well and its certainly a challenging situation to put it mildly."

Even conservatively sold at 9.50 knowing it could go close to 20 but thought up a mill don't be stupid take profits.

Its not like generally I'm a bad trader been doing this a long time, but then huge quick  gains desensitised me to large losses. Started making 100-300k a week on my new upsized portfolio and then the market turned sharp in March making it hard to bag those type of gains and here I am grinding again. Lesson learnt hopefully.

2021-05-01 14:31:00,wallstreetbets,When was the last time you went to a theater?
2021-05-01 09:30:50,wallstreetbets,"Short answer? No. There‚Äôs plenty of youtube videos explaining the problems and shortfalls of current hydrogen production technology, distribution and network problems and fuel cells system limitations. As of now, it‚Äôs nowhere close to being competitive with EV‚Äôs. I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as to totally disregard the technology, but from an observers standpoint, I‚Äôd bet on EV‚Äôs while monitoring developments in general hydrogen production technology as only significant advancements in tech could enable wide spread use. Speaking from memory, I think Toyota has invested a lot in that direction."
2021-05-01 09:35:15,wallstreetbets,"Check the 20 year stock history. Read some articles from 1999. It‚Äôs the technology that never came. And now that EVs have advanced by leaps and bounds, fuel cells are even further behind (never to catch up)."
2021-05-01 09:35:29,wallstreetbets,"bad idea, all around efficiency is only about 20% (for using an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen, transporting it to a fuel station, storage and then using a fuel cell to get power out of it). Therefore, it would be too expensive for passenger cars. The best use-case is for large-scale seasonal energy storage (could become a huge market, main competitors are CAES (compressed air energy storage) and ETES (electro-thermal energy storage, e.g. in the form of volcanic rock)) and aviation as well as maritime transport. 

Personally, I believe that all hydrogen companies are too richly valued."
2021-05-01 10:13:17,wallstreetbets,"It depends on the country. Its inefficient to use an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen in your own nation for its vehicle fleet when you can just direct that electricity directly to EVs. However transitioning to EVs places increased demand on electricity and if you are a nation that will struggle to meet that demand through factors like high population density or limited renewable opportunities, hydrogen makes sense.

That's because hydrogen can be imported/exported around the globe whereas electricity is restricted to interconnected grids. So for instance, you can build hydro/wind/solar + production in NZ and export to Japan where they are going to struggle building enough cost competitive renewables."
2021-05-01 17:34:01,wallstreetbets,"No but I think new battery technologies might be. Lithium is a pest for the planet.   

I'm not picking up on anything real yet but stuf like [this](https://scitechdaily.com/new-type-of-battery-created-that-can-charge-10x-faster-than-lithium-ion-batteries/) and [this](https://scitechdaily.com/an-aqueous-battery-thats-fast-charging-safer-and-less-expensive/) keeps me sharp.   

Obviously lithium ion is king but the moment there is a real alternative all those contracts Tesla has with their suppliers lose value. So do the batteries and the lithium itself. It's going to be another gold rush and another <5 year struggle for dominance in the ev market.     

Obviously all the car makers are on the look out for something like this. Exciting times."
2021-05-01 10:13:57,wallstreetbets,"With that in mind that most are saying No. The australian government has started to nerf the EV rollout. They are looking at charging suppliers of energy (solar) to the market while paying the measly 11c per kw tariff. They have started I believe charging a recharge tax for EVs in Victoria. The incumbent government has a shady mining magnate that has been used to introduce a dodgy expensive welfare card called Indue (his name is twiggy or Andrew Forrest), the rumored charge per card is 10k. This Liberal doner wants to set up a hydrogen plant and the day he mentioned it all the taxes and negative press started on EVs. SO while its not really feasible or good idea our government has always bent over backwards for mining and gas doners."

I know Corsair is popular and is probably still a good investment. But I can‚Äôt bring myself to throw any more money into them with my experiences. Their stuff is pricey but seems very cheaply made

They don't rely on it though, selling atmospheric gases alongside it. I'm not sure whether hydrogen cars will ever be a reality, but Aviation and Maritime can only resort to Nuclear and Hydrogen as oil prices rise. They sell on-site hydrogen production as well, which seem to be pretty good at their job. I can't see a real good bear case for them. Tempted to write some good DD work on it"

So you look at the company as a casual investor and say holy cow they are killing it, stock will go up I bet. But professional investors already were betting on that. Now it‚Äôs factored into the price and they cash out cuz who knows what will happen next‚Ä¶ they will wait for more info.

2021-05-01 13:43:38,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, you‚Äôre right, I said it backwards. They voted yes on the prop to define themselves as contract workers."

2021-05-01 10:31:36,wallstreetbets,"By that reasoning batteries are literally always a better option. There is no scenario in which hydrogen is more efficient because it has to be produced, stored and transported before ever getting converted to electricity in a fuel cell or burned in a traditional IC engine. Vehicle mass does not change the efficiency of batteries relative to hydrogen under normal conditions."
2021-05-01 14:12:14,wallstreetbets,"I agree, there has been a huge shift towards supporting local small businesses, Etsy may not be local but ppl think of it the same way. Why get a gift at Walmart or Amazon when you can get a one of a kind item and feel like you helped someone out at the same time. I don‚Äôt have any stock in it but I honestly believe it is here for a while."
2021-05-01 16:33:27,wallstreetbets,"This is a dumb question so mock me if you must....but if it‚Äôs online why would someone in New York care about the legality? Can you not gamble online on draft kings while living in New York?

2021-05-01 14:52:52,wallstreetbets,"I drove Lyft/Uber for a minute a few years back. I had a full time job that was salary and no time for a 2nd. Occasional gig driving to pick up some cash helped me develop a cushion to help quit that job, but I knew I was basically taking cash now against my car's depreciation, and quit when the payments went so low it wasn't worth it anymore. If I were less financially savvy I might have thought that was a ""good deal"", like people who like over-withholding on their taxes so they get a big refund."

2021-05-01 10:40:48,wallstreetbets,"These are all good points and true when talking about small size vehicles - but when talking about heavy duty vehicle the topic of energy density or refueling times hydrogen vs batteries are simply better ! Much better ! 

I don‚Äôt say that hydrogen is better for small size cars , no it‚Äôs not - but when talking trucks , ships , airplanes etc - hydrogen is the better option: why? Because it is more efficient:)"
2021-05-01 17:23:12,wallstreetbets,"The proposition to define them as contract workers passed. So yes, they are."
2021-05-01 13:30:59,wallstreetbets,"Hydrogen energy conversion is 80% efficient to manufacture and then 60% efficient to generate energy from a fuel cell into a motor for a total of 48% efficient. 

Batteries are closer to 90% efficient start to finish.

The only major shift/savings to be had with hydrogen is lower weight (so less work being done to move the overall mass) and potentially higher range.   The problem here is the largest markets for heavy duty stuff is freight and the amount of weight a truck/train/boat would carry for a complete load is generally going to make the weight of the power source negligible.  Also the currently available hydrogen technology for trucks only gives about 500 miles in range which is lower than diesel.

Current hydrogen tech really only really has one win in that it is a faster fueling time."

2021-05-01 12:34:57,wallstreetbets,"Arguing P/E with a company like AAPL has to be one of the dumbest uses of fundamentals.

Even Goldman gave up their bearish sentiment.

[FSD from Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/cvpxp3mgrhw61.png?width=1746&format=png&auto=webp&s=27d959d4fd9ffe476e5283c255656645038cd96d)

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: work in ML and robotics field, done lots of research in RL and control.

Tesla and its FSD are quite controversial: Fans appraised FSD beta 8.2 as if they are going to fly to the moon soon; Haters think Tesla's bankruptcy is around the corner. My take? There are quite some misunderstandings around self driving technologies, and Tesla use an interesting (and aggressive) approach. Since it is such a complex topic I will just keep it simple and pick a few often discussed points.

Roughly speaking, a self-driving stack can be functionally divided into perception-planning-control blocks. Depending on the approach, each block can be quite complex. This applies to Tesla's FSD.  Car control is a relatively mature tech with years of experiences and not a huge problem for self-driving cars at the current stage, as we are not trying to do drifting or anything fancy for now.  

Perception used to be really challenging before the age of NNs (i.e. since 10s). Now it is much better and probably partially ""solved"" through sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, etc) + hd maps (as in Waymo and probably Cruise). It is still a problem for Tesla, who take an pretty aggressive, camera only approach. 

Many people fighting over ""camera is the best"" and ""LiDAR is the dead end"", are still mostly talking about perception part.  So as I mentioned, perception is ""partially solved"" for Waymo in geo fenced area using sensor fusion. IHMO this is not because they are limited in their tech, but more of a choice for safety purpose. In fact to get the sensor fusion done properly, for each modal you need some NNs to be trained with labelled data (thinking about labelled humans in LiDAR point clouds in addition to camera images). On the other side, Tesla do the ""leap of faith"" with cheap sensors, which is understandable as they need to sell cars and are more sensitive to costs. Which is the ""right"" approach? No one knows and depends on what you define by ""right"". Here let me list a few remarks below and hopefully clarify some common misconceptions:

* More data does not equals to automatically accuracy improvement. Lots of factors like new architecture, hyper parameter tuning and label accuracy play more important role.
* BTW Tesla have being throwing data away for many years. 
* The problem with driving is that, rare events follow some long tail distributions and thus there will always be ""out of range"" data which the NNs have to extrapolate. 
* What DNNs learnt might not be what you want it learn and they can be fooled through adversarial attacks. Partially the reason we want to have redundancy sensors which may be fooled in different ways.
* Is LiDAR doomed in rainy days? Nope, there are already solutions for that, a few years ago. Check this video from Waymo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYwS-gtAJMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYwS-gtAJMo)
* LiDAR hurts eyes: not much in 1550 nm range unless you peek at it for at zero-point for long time.

&#x200B;

[LiDAR in rain](https://preview.redd.it/a6b6z03srhw61.png?width=1726&format=png&auto=webp&s=54c2a499b5dad20cfa1cb2e2d179ad58846c9904)

Alright, suppose Tesla solved this perception problem successfully using their cameras and auto labelling, what is next?  We have not talked about motion planning, which is arguably the actually hardest part.  What makes motion planning hard is the ""semantics of driving"", i.e. driving in a safe, socially acceptable way and properly interactions with other moving agents:  the joint probabilistic distribution of many moving agents around the car is extremely hard to model and intractable. It is easy to make the robot/car move in a relatively static environment, even it look more ""amazing"":

The hard problem lies in busy, urban areas. For example, what if the car turns half way in a intersection and blocked by traffics in front? What if there are no MPH sign in certain roads how fast/slow should the car drive?  How do we understand the intention of each pedestrian/cyclist/driver? We do that through eye contact, gestures, etc, but the car cannot do it. This is both a challenge for the perception (to understand the social cues), and the planning part, to make socially acceptable decision that does not scare the other parties which may make wrong decisions that can cause incidents. This has been the reason behind the ""slow progress"" of Waymo since probably 2015 ish, and it is an area that Tesla barely touches today.  See this video of a Waymo car in a busy parking lot without any driver:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5SeVxYAZzk&t=28s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5SeVxYAZzk&t=28s)

It still struggles to get out elegantly (thought it is pretty safe).  There is also a recent video on FSD in SF:

[https://youtu.be/NfikK9aWrlE?t=556](https://youtu.be/NfikK9aWrlE?t=556)

[\\""Nightmare\\"" for self driving cars](https://preview.redd.it/1jjpgjdjshw61.png?width=1713&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc3c289e2d3155f35aedcf6ea3eb8257648bb162)

It is generally doing a much better job than a year ago, yet you can observe the difficulty of this crowd scene driving problem. Both Waymo and Cruise are entering SF this year and we will see how they handle such messy scenarios soon. BTW for anyone interested, current Waymo's planning stack is based on a ""MultiPath"" approach:

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05449.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05449.pdf)

Meanwhile, I feel Tesla is using some sort of heuristics + MPC (model predictive control), as visible from the planned path that is jumping/wiggling all the time.  

So, how long can Tesla be ready for robo-taxi? For this part I would say, technically it will be very long:  Adding the last ""9"" in 99.9999% reliability required for lv5 may take more effort than getting to 99.99%.  And Tesla is not even reporting disengagement data for now. However, Elon is great at telling stories and convincing ordinary folks to test their beta software on car without paying them (well, people have to pay to be a beta tester which is amazing from a sales pov). 

TLDR:  Robo-taxis is far, self driving is fun :)"

This stock has gotten severely beat down in the past few months due to the Alibaba's regulations and investigation.

1. JD logistics IPO announcement is going to coming in the next few weeks. 



2. The Chinese government should finish their regulation review on JD in the next few weeks, which would clear any uncertainty on the company. This would easily cause a 10% rally in 1 day.



3. The company's book value is $120/share. So there is 30-40% upside based solely on fundamentals. Politics aside.



4. Earnings are coming up for this stock near mid-end of May. Should expect a reversal by then.



5. Options IV is a complete joke right now and a great opportunity to get in.



6. Cathie Wood has been adding to her JD position for the last week. She is pretty heavy in this company. She carries it in multiple of her ETFs with a significant holding.

2021-05-01 14:41:31,wallstreetbets,Its true. I would love to get to a point where I can exercise a couple of the contracts and hold the company. I predicted a minor breakout around this time. Hopefully it happens to where I can get out with a minor loss
2021-05-01 18:59:03,wallstreetbets,"Imagine a company hires a team of 1000 people to look over their data and find more efficient ways to run the business. Everything from market trends, labor force, and supply chain. This group can get it right some of the time and save said company $1,000,000/yr. That‚Äôs a win.

PLTR shows up. Double clicks a few things. And now everything is analyzed and it tells you straight up what to do. Company saves $25,000,000/yr and doesn‚Äôt need to have a team of 1000 people.

This software as a service costs less than staffing and produces a better bottom line. So they make a contract and PLTR has a steady stream of income.

Now multiply that across other major companies, government sectors, technology research, etc. 

Full disclosure I own shares and sell covered calls and cash secured puts. I‚Äôm long PLTR. I like the stock."

I have looked at the financials for PLTR and I am having a hard time understanding why people have so much faith in it. 

it is hemorrhaging over a billion a year and it's market cap is over $40 billion, it also has never turned a profit.

Am I missing something?"
2021-05-01 07:26:19,wallstreetbets,Do you believe in the price?
2021-05-01 10:43:02,wallstreetbets,"The problem I have with PLTR is its reliance on government contracts spanning years. It's not like a lot of that isn't already priced in. Granted, if the price eclipses $22 then it might be a good time for calls."
2021-05-01 12:45:43,wallstreetbets,Sure thing Karpie. What about the insider trading tho?
2021-05-01 10:03:58,wallstreetbets,stock options. Huge difference from a billion in cash. Incentives like stock options have always been unlocked after achieving big targets and keeping operators to stick with the company.

Revenue growth is nice but doesn‚Äôt mean much if you can‚Äôt make a profit. 

And their share structure is crazy. They created different class of stocks that give them control of the company. No matter how much people buy (of what‚Äôs on the market) they won‚Äôt have effective voting power/control of the company. And the company can turn down profitable ventures without any investor input. They have zero incentive to make the stock price go up or deliver value to investors, they can ignore y‚Äôall and make decisions that tank their share value if they have an overlying strategic vision. And y‚Äôall bought into that lol."

YoY growth translated into a 100% increase in net losses as well; that 300 million dollar increase in ""growth"" resulted in a 580 million dollar increase in loss YoY.

Took 18 years to sell 1 billion,  and they trade as if 5 billion is a light expectation and a guarantee in the next 4 years.  Maybe the company is cool,  and the product is cool, but the valuation isn't.  Just because it's considered ""growth"" doesn't mean you can ignore all valuation metrics and pay whatever the hell Mr. Market says. The common response is ""look what amzn and tsla did.""

The fact that she makes a stock purchase of PLTR for one or more of her funds cannot be interpreted to mean that she is or is not making a long hold investment.

2021-05-01 12:54:28,wallstreetbets,"The barriers to entry in data analytics is data acquisition and engineering talent which Amazon/Apple have in spades. The engineering/logistical prowess of these companies are geared towards their respective offerings and neither are easily transferable skillsets. Amazon has tremendous capability in logistics owing to its warehouse and distribution networks while Apple has a history of outsourcing these solutions to the lowest competent bidder. Conversely, Amazon does not have the hardware/design prowess Apple has in creating phones. An idiot could figure this out.

But data analytics? Any company with deep pockets can pick off talent and make inroads in this space. As mentioned before the real problem is acquiring data. Palantir is making no effort in this space as Karp mentioned it is merely a platform to manipulate data to the highest extent - ideally to make the common man have capabilities similar to a data scientist through its platform. It is a lofty goal and quite interesting. But to argue that it doesn't face stiff, foreboding competition is a tad naive and without access to a vast dataset like its competitors it makes this task especially difficult.

2021-05-01 13:15:22,wallstreetbets,"Yes, as I said, just because it‚Äôs possible, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs viable. Amazon is already offering Palantir‚Äôs products in AWS, likely for the same reason.

I would argue that the NSA dataset can probably compete with the likes of Apple/Amazon and Palantir is the only software company in the world that is on the brink of gaining full access. Neither Apple nor Amazon are realistic competitors. The only real competitor is Google, but again, G‚Äôs security clearance doesn‚Äôt even come close.

And yes, they‚Äôre profitable 0.06 EPS, adjusted for SBC."

2021-05-01 07:55:33,wallstreetbets,That's literally what they used to say about it when it dropped to $25. Now you are moving the goalposts to $20.
2021-05-01 13:19:47,wallstreetbets,Yall have some massive wrinkles in yalls brains
2021-05-01 14:22:26,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for providing the vibe everyone needs. Fair, yet positive"
2021-05-01 08:20:58,wallstreetbets,"You are comparing share price to the highs,  not market capitalization to what they sell,  what they earn,  and what they are projected to sell.  I can speak for myself that I never called a 25$ price, so I have never moved a goalpost. I simply treat companies as if I'm offered to buy the entire business, and I wouldn't pay 40b for a company that's been in business this long who just achieved 1b in annual sales with no profit.  The truth is the company valuation is over weight on speculation than it is fundamental.  Why should I believe that they will have massive growth after failing to do so for so many years? I do think they'll grow,  but as an investor...I want to maximize and capitalize personally on as much of the growth as I can.  I don't want to pay what I feel is full price for the growth that they guided as if it's been executed today.

I think the most frustrating part of trying to discuss with pltr bulls is that their case never uses any mathematical argument to support an uptrend from here,  and that they act like it's impossible for this company to underperform. There isn't an argument made that doesn't include ""look at TSLA, AMZN, AAPL"" etc. as part of the valuation argument.

 I do like the company,  but hate the price to pay to own it."
2021-05-01 08:57:05,wallstreetbets,Your view is very short sighted. The pandemic fast forwarded technology by at least 5 years. This is a long term play so apes buying weeklies will obviously get slaughtered.
2021-05-01 14:17:46,wallstreetbets,"I agree on your short term analysis.

I love the PLTR but, short-term‚Ä¶hate the stonk.

Their double-click demo day was disappointing, the video of Papa Karp in the barn was SNL worthy and executive stock options are a huge expense (compared to revenue) that will hurt profitability for several quarters.

I disagree with your bearish ‚Äúbeen in business for x years and only have $1B rev with no profit and limited non-gov commercial revenue‚Äù POV.

PLTR, like Arpanet, has been optimizing their software for more than a decade‚Ä¶funded by DOD/DARPA.

No other software in history has this type of elite development.

This software is good enough for DARPA and NNSA (US nuclear security agency)‚Ä¶so it is good enough for any F500 company.

The software is business category agnostic‚Ä¶any company with big data (structured, unstructured, and semistructured) dispersed across multiple sources/data silos can see huge operational/manufacturing/product benefits.

They‚Äôve evolved their software product to include different levels‚Ä¶from high-end consulting to low-touch stand-alone.

Bottom line, their moat is deep and their TAM is huge‚Ä¶but, growth will take time."
2021-05-01 16:35:42,wallstreetbets,"The greater fool theory isn't an illegitimate approach at all. 

PLTR is a meme stock, but unlike many meme stocks it at least has some potential. Sure, it has P/S ratios twenty times higher than its competitors, but there's so much money floating around it's entirely possible it moons for no logical reason.

But I'm not here to make smart investments. I'm here to fuck around. I get your point."
2021-05-01 09:54:49,wallstreetbets,"I don't doubt the long term,  that's why I like the company.  I just feel there is enough time to buy it on my terms,  not on the markets terms."
2021-05-01 14:55:55,wallstreetbets,Completely agree
2021-05-01 10:28:25,wallstreetbets,"Very true and respect your opinion. For me, I'm not going to sit there trying to call bottoms because it's s a losers game. I honestly love the dips because I just keep on adding to my positions. All the bear reasons mentioned above have merit but it's looking at the glass half full. The other side is that this company has been investing heavily in their products which always pays off in the long run. They were the go to company when the pandemic hit and allowed countries to use their products free of charge. The company also received bad rep for working with ICE but now that Biden is in office all that is out the window. In a year from now it won't matter if you paid $19 or $22 for the stock...."
2021-05-01 11:08:45,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you on not worrying about a couple bucks if you think your getting a company that's going to really hit it big.  The difference in my view is just that I can't get myself beyond 15$ in my valuation, and right now anything I've been adding lately are beaten up cheap stocks. I have overall market concerns, and it's not keeping me from adding, but making me very selective to protect my downside.  I truly believe this is going to head to the teens at some point whether it's company results,  or overall market dragging it down.  Because I really believe this,  I can't invest in it with the belief that I may get it for 25-30% less. That to me is significant enough to hold off on going long.  If I don't,  there are many other watch list companies for me. I'm pushing 40 different holdings,  and I generally do well when I stick to my terms and agenda rather than stretching to the markets term."
2021-05-01 11:28:05,wallstreetbets,"Why aren‚Äôt you just averaging in over time? I‚Äôve bought for under $10, over $30 and everywhere in between. Timing the market is a lot riskier than being consistent imo. But overall, I see your point."
2021-05-01 12:55:07,wallstreetbets,"To be honest at the risk of being a social outcast and being flamed.  This position has been a short for me as a hedge.  I did it from over 32 to 20.50 the first time and my current position was at 24.4 entry.  It's been working real well since my long positions way outgain any increase this one has been doing,  and I'm red days I have been absorbing losses the way this trades.  I figure I'll exit at 27$ (to lock a profit between the two trades) or close to my 15$ target buy.

I'll just add that I don't see this as timing the market. I'm actively buying as my opportunities arise, just not in this security. I buy anywhere an opportunity presents itself.  This one just hasn't to my liking yet."

2021-05-01 03:58:11,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I‚Äôll have to reevaluate the option of next week ends up being massive down days up to earnings, cause then IV crush will ruin me. It‚Äôs still within reach, so it‚Äôs ok to keep. But if stocks drops another 4-5% before earnings, then I have to sell and reevaluate a different price."
2021-05-01 17:46:16,wallstreetbets,This sentiment usually means your gonna be rich. Low key thinking about swinging a few calls for this reason alone. Inversing wsb sentiment is still legit if you can time it right
2021-05-01 04:36:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I‚Äôm long and also option heavy because they are the top player in their category and they‚Äôve barely scratched the surface with how much their customers will spend. Of course, it‚Äôs dependent on the day. Sometimes negative sentiment across the board in the market can cause good news to still be bad and vice versa."

2021-05-01 03:22:26,wallstreetbets,"Well, it wasn‚Äôt when I first got it. Really thought we wouldn‚Äôt have a dump before earnings, but it is what it is. I‚Äôll guess based on next weeks actions what to do."
2021-05-01 05:04:14,wallstreetbets,Dump before the earnings is not a good sign.....
2021-05-01 05:08:51,wallstreetbets,"I would say that‚Äôs true, If it was the only one dumping. The entire market dumped, so the fact that it‚Äôs before earnings is just a coincidence."
2021-05-01 05:15:36,wallstreetbets,That is true but the volume looks a bit high. I would at least take some off the table if it doesn't come back up before ER or if the market is weak.
2021-05-01 05:27:00,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree. I‚Äôm hoping it goes up a little before earnings and take some off. If not, then I have to just eat the loss and take some off if it dips lower and find a different price point."

2021-05-01 01:32:58,wallstreetbets,Catalyst was a low float ignored stock that was pretty much an easy 1-2$ swing per day that got shorted as it peaked. I was yoloing 10k a day waiting for the spike and pulled out when it happened if you look back from the 16th it was like clockwork I think it didn‚Äôt happen 2 days in this 2 week process. Finally I think they overshorted and it didn‚Äôt go down. Which in turn lead the spike to skyrocket. Maybe a poor choice stock to short because of the low volume so no one paper sold. ‚ÄúMostly forgotten about stock held or something‚Äù Wednesday was a hard short day 15% I believe with 2 halts on the increase then one more halt Thursday on bell and instant drop.

2021-05-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD My Fat Ex-wife edition - Becky Stocks - Etsy - Down 5% April 30th, not going to stay down. It's  afterhours Friday April 30th and the market just took a bit of a dump.  Nothing to panic over but a solidly red day following an all time high.  Previously I have focused by DD efforts into research on Boomer Stocks.   Great stocks with real products, strong histories of growth, objectively clear market conditions (e.g. steel is up bigly US Steel will likely have a great Q2)

This week I need to focus on the other side of my portfolio - Becky Stocks.   My fat ex-wife always makes me add some Becky to our portfolio so I looked into the Becky index and found ETSY.  It looked like a solid option at first with earnings still approaching and other similar stocks gaining post earnings (Amazon, Shopify), but then to top it off it dumped 5% today.  A $25 billion dollar company lost over a $1 billion in value in a single day.  Not because of any particular negative news or anything, it appears to just be a general sell-off.

**Does Becky still like Etsy? - Yes**

Etsy has grown revenue and profits by margins ranging from 100 to 500% YoY growth in all the key financial metrics.  Etsy is more popular than ever and Google Trends data/Alexa rankings don't show a noteworthy slowdown.  ([https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0byvh\_&geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0byvh_&geo=US))

**Does Becky have incentive to buy cute Etsy items as things slowly open up? - Yes**

Responsible Becky hasn't had the ability to host house parties or show off newest 'Live, Laugh, Love' decor.  Everyone wants to get out and see friends/family and Becky knows that theme parties and custom theme'd decor is he best way to prepare for these parties.   Just as a general rule there is suddenly a lot more incentive to make your house more guest friendly moving forward.  

**Was Etsy just over-valued and dumping?**  

While the P/E for Etsy is high at 76 that is comparable to Amazon (who is going to rate lower partially because they just had great earnings while Etsy hasn't reported yet to clear out Q1 2020 from it's ratings) and less than companies like Square and Shopify.  Obviously growth is assumed, but Etsy clearly has room to grow so it should not be a problem.  Etsy is currently trading almost $50 below it ATH from March 1st and while having wild swings over the past months it has been generally stable as a stock and there isn't any reason to suspect another major shift downward.

**TL D/R What does it all Mean?**

Etsy is a solid growth stock that appears to be at or near bottom with an earnings report coming up that will likely be favorable.  Other companies in online retail have seen boosts from good earnings so why not Etsy?  

&#x200B;

**Boomer Thoughts**

Etsy may be 'Tech' but it is harnessing the ingenuity of the American people to create new and unique products.  They have already shown that they have strong management by using their early pandemic mask sales jump to gain, retain, and boost their customer base.   Hard workers making physical goods with solid leadership makes for a good company.  They don't have a dividend yet but they are new and need to reinvest in the company.  Considering their primarily female audience making efforts to reach out to men would be a great next step.  Improving the search function could certainly help.

**Fat Ex-Wife Thoughts**

There is no way Etsy is going to stay down this low.  Everyone I know is using Etsy for personal products and gifts.  Amazon is great for generic products but it has become absolute trash when you want to find something meaningful due to the way generic products flood the market for just about anything you want.  Etsy makes online shopping fun again while Amazon shopping is about as fun as running any errand.  It is going back up to its 250 ATH and beyond.   Just hold on for a while!  My Ex-husband wants to buy US steel instead.  They already had earnings and already went up.  He has all quarter to rotate what's left of his losses into X.  I want my part of the portfolio in something happy!

**Positions**

None, plan to buy calls for the end of May either ITM or slightly OTM Monday

Etsy has beautiful clothes and jewelry which since everyone became fat during pandemic, people need to hide that fact with nice clothes and jewelry. 

Think plunging necklines, to draw the eye to the goods, on an up-cycled hand dyed dress or earrings the size of puppies to detract from fat pale bloated face. 

People are going to want to get ‚Äúout there‚Äù and wear beautiful bright colors and flashy pieces that are unique. Plus since they couldn‚Äôt travel they got all this cash saved up to spend on impressing people. So they will wear nice stuff and go on Holiday.

2021-04-30 23:56:35,wallstreetbets,I'm a supplier.  They still require everyone that supplies them to go and confirm things in a 1990's green screen database you access through a web browser based emulator.  This system tracks their entire supply line.  They have tried to move away from it multiple times and failed.  Leadership at Ford is bad.
2021-05-01 00:02:23,wallstreetbets,At this point Ford only makes cars in order to give people loans to buy them. It seems like they should be less affected by the chip shortage than a company that actually has good profit margins on their vehicles.

2021-05-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"INFLATION NATION  The current economic data being released combined with recent statements from large corporations about pricing should be ringing inflation alarm bells. It‚Äôs not just meme stocks that are mooning, the price of everything is going thru the roof. Could it be that the inevitable hangover from the money printer going BRRRRR is approaching? I have no idea, but the numbers are staggering.

Let‚Äôs look past the bullshit CPI which registered 2.6% for the March reading. The everyday items you and I consume are going up by much larger amounts than the FEDs favorite inflation gauge. Take housing prices for example, which everyone knows are going up at a crazy rate. February year over year increase was 12% nationally and shows no sign of slowing down. In my area, houses are selling in days at 20-25% over list. But the CPI doesn‚Äôt reflect this. The CPI tries to estimate housing inflation using ‚Äúowner equivalent rent‚Äù which is what a homeowner would pay to rent their own house. The cost of the house is ignored in this equation, the focus being on the cost of the shelter it provides instead. That‚Äôs great, unless you want to buy a house. 

The prices of just about everything that it takes to build that house are going up too. The price of a new lot to build on is up 11% YOY and will likely continue to climb as supply of new lots is down 20% in that same period. The materials that make up the home are up as follows:

Lumber: +67% YTD

Copper: +27% YTD

Gypsum: +7% YOY

Steel Mill Products: +18% YOY

Add in a shortage of construction workers, a national push for higher wages and ultra-low interest rates and housing shows no signs of becoming more affordable anytime soon. 

Fulfilment costs are going up across the board as well, due to numerous factors. Disruptions in the global shipping markets have led to price increases of 25-50% on shipping containers. A shortage of U.S. truck drivers will also lead to higher shipping costs, as well as having the add on affect of raising the cost of gas. Typically, 10% of U.S. tanker capacity is idle, currently it is 20-25% idle due to the shortage. Summer driving season is approaching. This may cause a feedback loop of higher gas prices as supply struggles to keep up with demand, negatively impacting consumers and businesses alike. 

To compound the aforementioned issues, the prices of the commodities and inputs used to produce a broad range of goods are also increasing rapidly. Look at these increases in just the last month alone:

Cocoa: +2.5%

Coffee: +12.7%

Sugar: +13.6%

Lean Hogs: +6.3%

Rough Rice: +3.6%

Oats: +7.4%

Soybeans: +7.7%

Wheat: +18%

Corn: +18.5%

Farmers are now substituting wheat grown for human consumption as animal feed due to the huge increase in the price of corn. This feedstock inflation can trickle thru the butcher block and dairy isle and potentially increase prices of meat, chicken, milk, eggs and cheese, just to name a few. 

In the recent earnings calls of several multi-national corporations the topic of pricing and supply chain issues was highlighted. Coke and Pepsi are both going to raise prices, and if you look at the price of sugar, the reason is obvious. P&G and Mondelez both announced intentions to do the same, and Kraft spoke about rising costs across it supply chains. Selling a smaller amount for the same price isn‚Äôt gonna cut it this time anymore. Prices are going up. 

So, inflation appears to be working its way thru commodities markets and supply chains and will soon be knocking on the door. Printer‚Äôs days of going BRRRR may be catching up with us. Don‚Äôt worry though, you likely won‚Äôt be affected. Unless you live inside, drive, eat, drink coffee or pop, shop online or have anything to do with those industries, you‚Äôll be just fine!"

This is why, however lumpy it has EVER been, the stock market (choose any trading floor) has always gone UP.

This has been true since the Dutch first started trading shares in 1500-and-something (or whenever)

2)  **And rising investment prices cause inflation.**

Simplistic ain't it -  but there ya go

It‚Äôs easy to look at prices over the last year and say WOW Look at the prices of things compared to last year WHEN PRICES OF THINGS WERE AT AN ALL TIME LOW DUE TO THE CORONA CRASH. 

- oil prices today are exactly the same price as it was just prior to the Corona crash
- wheat, beans, agricultural products are still all significantly lower than they were in the 2008-2015 period and inflation was pretty much the same rate back then as it is now. 
- the price of sugar is still 20% cheaper than it was in 2017. 
- cocoa is basically at an all-time low and not increasing 
- lumber prices are basically half it is now than the period back in 2010-2015 housing boom
- the price of aluminum, zinc, nickel and other metals are all basically the same price it was in 2018

It‚Äôs easy to look at and compare prices of today‚Äôs commodities against the all-time low point of the epic crash of prices last year and say wow!! Things are up 100% from all time lows!! Inflation!!! Zoom out of your 1 year historical chart and you‚Äôll see how silly of an argument that is. 

Also no shit, prices have been increasing heavily lately. The pandemic is coming to an end and people are getting back to business; supply is low because industry has been shut down for a year and demand is sharply increasing because we‚Äôre getting back to normal. Supply vs demand is what drives the prices up, and the major green candles on these commodities is mostly a result of this.

In the short term inflation may appear high, but once supply catches up with the spike in demand, nobody will be taking about inflation anymore. Mark my words."

I've been warning people I know about this and they're like, ""the regular news (MSM) isn't reporting it, you're getting that info from the dark web, it isn't true, the economy is great""üò± I mention that US Gov is printing $$$ as fast as it can without any regards. I also remind them about 2008 and the media/financial/gov't conspiracy.  Some try to explain 2008 to me as ""something else caused the crash"". But they can't tell me exactly what. When I explain exactly ""what"" including F\*\*\*ery, collusion, market manipulation, tranches, etc., they just stare at me bewildered. Most are college educated and successfull in their lifMe, I'm just a Reddit educated autistic retarded diamond handed ape construction workerüíéüôåü¶çüöÄ"
2021-05-01 10:02:29,wallstreetbets,Imo the jury is still out on inflation.  Credit is still contracting and america's savings accounts are still growing.  If those two things reverse and unemployment goes down then maybe inflation is the case.
2021-05-01 10:11:33,wallstreetbets,"Here we go again, trying to apply logic to the market.  Next you'll be trying to tell me there was no reason for the market to go up 50% over the past year of total normalcy."
2021-05-01 10:15:12,wallstreetbets,"It could be an issue over the next few years perhaps. What I wouldn‚Äôt be worried about is a Weimar type event playing out here is why. First and foremost, if the world is experiencing similar inflation, it won‚Äôt become unlivable in the USA, USA is too big to fail in terms of tech/trade/wealth and in terms of military strength.

More importantly though, the long term trend is EXTREMELY deflationary. The tech we use that continues to replace workers is deflationary. Our aging boomer population is incredibly deflationary as opposed to what happened in the 70s. Did you know an estimated 20 million boomer households would have to pass on wealth just for these younger generations to be able to afford their assets at current levels? So we may experience short term inflation pain, especially if the Fed starts tapering bond purchases (inverse logic because the Fed buying bonds puts more money in to financial markets and increases the wealth gap). So when the fed buys bonds as they‚Äôve been doing for years that has been a deflationary force also.

My summary of all of this being yes we are highly susceptible to a big inflation move and it is likely in progress esp if the Fed tapers (because M2 would fall as money velocity picks up, stock prices falling can also exacerbate this as people are forced to invest in the real economy instead of the Wall Street economy) but the chances of it lasting more than a few years is slim to none."

2021-05-01 01:42:37,wallstreetbets,"They sort of include these, but they choose metrics that minimize true inflation. So for housing it is included, but they only look at rental costs and don't look at how much it costs to buy a home. Because of COVID and people fleeing cities, rent has been depressed in many urban areas so because of that there's ""no housing inflation"" despite the prices of houses themselves jumping 20% YoY.

So yeah, if you want to move into a part of Manhattan that's now plagued with crime with half empty apartment buildings because everyone there fled for the suburbs then congrats, your rent is now $7500 a month instead of $8500 so you're SAVING money."

I have for many decades been very concerned with the fake inflation statistics and seen that people take this burden. Look at the way the working day has changed from 9-5 to 8-6 and with no real increase in wages. It used to be possible for one person in the household to earn enough to support a family. A minimum wage job was still a job worth working, now its a joke. Its not just the states either, anywhere that has adopted  similar economic systems is suffering the same fate. The UK, Germany, France, Spain and more are all struggling to keep a lid on this issue"
2021-04-30 23:59:24,wallstreetbets,"they do include it but don't tie anything to it or it would cost the government more.

The difference is real estate throws off cash flow and you can leverage to the tits. 75/25 LTV gives you a 4x leverage. If you own a $100k building with $75k loan you are only in it for $25k. If prices jump 50%, then it's worth $150k and your leverage ratio just dropped to 50/50 LTV and you get to keep the cash flow in the meantime. Oh and paying the mortgage payment also chips away at the principal so you would actually owe less than 50% on the property. 

This dow not apply to single family homes though which return less than 2% appreciation over the long run. Cash flowing multifamily and mixed use are where it's at."

2021-05-01 06:41:35,wallstreetbets,"You don't want stocks if inflation returns in a sustained way. Interest rates/bond rates will increase. History shows, across many stock markets, that PE ratios expand when interest rates are low. Example: Japan in the 80's, and the US the past 10 years.

PE ratios contract when interest rates climb. Look at how cheap stocks became the last time the US experienced significant inflation (late 70's). 'Earnings Yield' tracks with interest rates. That's the proximate cause of the late 2018 crash."

They're decoupling the asset price from the consumer price. Everyone knows the fed printer money is flowing straight into assets and blowing up valuations, but that's not a cost of *goods*.

Not that there aren't issues with that too (mainly being a subsidy to the asset holders at the cost of not increasing effective prices for everyone else) but it's not consumer price inflation.

Now we're starting to see rampant consumer price inflation that the various adaptations/changes allowed in their model can't cover."

When everyone thinks some asset only goes up, it never ends well.

Also, COVID only generated a grand total of 600k excess moving requests from January through July of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. It was a 3.6% increase or thereabouts. Of those, only about 300k net emigrants were moving away from the largest cities in the country. 

People fleeing cities in enormous volumes is overblown, that's why real estate markets are not actually showing any real signs of weakness in those places.

Every one of our customers in automotive shut down the projects that we were developing for, and they have all ramped back online quickly since around the end of January seemingly trying to make up for the lost time last year.

I definitely see you point, though. There is obvious upside in taking advantage of the situation and it's clear that it's happening."

Further, when 20M or so people lost their jobs, why would the people who were fortunate enough to keep their jobs go out and buy a car if not for 0% interest financing and stimulus checks used as down payments?

The bottom line is that the US consumer and the businesses that they run are addicted to spending every nickel they get their hands on. The concept of saving money for a rainy day quite simply does not exist. People only save money when it comes directly from Uncle Sam, apparently."

Honestly, the best indicator for how bizarre the world is right now is LiveNation's stock price. Their revenue in 2020 was down like 90%, and their share performance during that year was around a 15% increase from 1/1/2020-12/31/2020. The only thing keeping them afloat was massive debt issuance at extremely low rates.

2021-05-01 14:11:28,wallstreetbets,this is why real estate is up on average 10% in the last 3 months which is an unusually high growth rate. Buying into the market now would just mean you would have to wait longer for you house to appreciate to its true value because you bought in so high.

A shit ton of businesses are permanently culled from the market. With demand staying the same those that survive are taking a bigger share of the pie and making money hand over fist. We're going through a consolidation event, not an inflationary event."

2021-05-01 12:09:04,wallstreetbets,"> In my business, there absolutely was a demand shock for about 3 weeks.

The exact length of the shortest bear market in history corresponding to easily the worst economic crisis in history. A nearly complete, coordinated global shutdown of commerce has literally never happened, and yet here we are barely a year later talking about how everything is fine? The global supply of money has increased by an astronomical amount, and as you said, a shit ton of businesses are now DOA. Those businesses had owners, they had employees, they had vendors, they had customers, all of whom are now fucked sideways. If you ran a concert lighting company in March 2020 and employed 70 people, and you were making $150k annually running the business, what the hell are you doing now? Certainly all of your employees are cut, maybe you have been paying rent? PPP came in and covered a tiny fraction of business expense, but it sure as shit did not cover everything. 

> making money hand over fist

Money which is about to be rendered less valuable because there is now so much more of it on the books. 

Here's the thing, if printing $7T of US dollars in like ten months drives no significant long-term negative consequences, then why does anyone in the country need a job or need to do anything at all? Just print the dollars and hand them out. We don't need taxes, we don't need anything other than the Fed."

The profits in the consolidated markets are driving massive reinvestment in the models that worked through the pandemic. We're opening 200 new restaurants in the next 18 months they're just delivery carryout only, not dine in.

The more your bet is correct, the more you win.  


OP is retarded and placed a \~$4,200 bet that TSLA will be over $820.90 per share by 5/7, even though TSLA hasn't been that high in fucking months. OP is going to lose all of the money he bet. This is what we call an FD."

So, one time only, I'll go ahead and reveal my watch list for the month and, if I feel it's relevant/not already covered by a DD, any positions I might already have.  Stop asking.

&#x200B;

# My long list (both established positions and sentiment/momentum trades I'll make):

&#x200B;

1. $CLNE (Positions established; look at DD)
2. $MA
3. $BABA (Positions established; look at DD)
4. $BE (Positions established; look at DD)
5. $CAT (Positions re-established today in fact - July 230c's that I timed perfectly)
6. $EXPE
7. $AAPL
8. $ALGN
9. $PSFE (Positions established earlier)
10. $CVX
11. $ENPH (Positions established today)
12. $TSCO (Positions established)
13. $CAR (Positions established)
14. $KMI (September 18s)
15. $BB (Positions established; see DD)

&#x200B;

# The Short watch list:

&#x200B;

Note that, when it comes to shorting, I do a lot more scalping and very short term swing trading.  May is typically a month of low volume, so you have to be agile.  Puts are generally 2 steps out of the money at open.  Do your own DD.  This is also not a complete list, just a daily watch list of companies that I feel are going to fare roughly or whom have typically underperformed this time of year.  This is also not a short and hold list.  If you don't know what I'm saying, you should stay away from these.

&#x200B;

1. $TSLA (Established today @ an average cost basis of $712.11)
2. $UPST
3. $TWTR (Established April 28th @ $66.08)
4. CLOV (always good for an intraday scalp when the capuchins go full retard)
5. $SPCE
6. $PTON
7. $TSM
8. $BLNK
9. $GS (Established yesterday)
10. $PINS
11. $BMBL
12. $EGHT
13. $MDB
14. $PCG

With that said, how do you think the semiconductor industry (and by extension EVs to an extent) will do in the coming months? My thoughts are that they'll be hit harder in Q2 despite generally beating earnings (for AMD and NIO, at least.

Mastercard  is going to be more muted than $V because $MA is more rooted in Euro  and places where they've done more frequent lockdowns.  They don't have a  ton of exposure in the US to offset that.  Not saying they're gonna  have a bad quarter, but they aren't gonna blow off doors like $V did.

Wanted to pick your brain a bit more and ask what caused such unequivocal change  - is it perhaps uncertainty of upcoming ER; i mean, on one hand i kno u have been clear this not for a faint of heart - on the other, pretty sure i've read somewhere (thinking OG's) you saying you'd stick w it even if you were way underwater.... and anything under 42 is ""free"" tendies

$MA was easy to spot because...think about it, how many Mastercards do you have?  I've got over 30 cc's and I've only got one, and I only have it because I want at least 1 with that particular logo.

A few fun facts & updates:

* I had 3 Miller Lites and a half gallon of water about 2 hours or so before the video

* It took two attempts. The first attempt I forgot to turn on the music and I really wanted to play that song... this was after I drank my piss too, but realized it didn't taste that bad so I could easily do it again.

* Basement floors are painted so it doesn't look like a rape dungeon

* I didn't lose a life changing amount on the option trade. If I did, I probably would've drank too much and passed out, so there would've been no video.

* I'm still single"

>!pulled and disassembled the headlight housings. subaru chrome coated the accent piece inside the housing for premium and base model trims. it's an offensive aesthetic, possibly criminal when you think about the fact that they actually take the extra step to CHROME COAT OVER SOMETHING IN-TREND WITH OUTDATED AESTHETIC . This is probably done intentionally by subaru to upsell you to the limited trim which comes with mostly de-chromed housings. At any rate, I was able to pull the head lights out and remove the headlight trim that needed repair. I dipped both pieces into a 5 gallon bucket of highly concentrated zep purple. I soaked the trim peices in the zep for several hours and eventually all the chrome coating had dissolved. reassembled the headlamps and reinstalled. and since I had to take the bumper off, i also replaced by shattered fog lights with diode dynamics light pods. i opted not to install an led c light that I had purchased because the kit did not come with a solution for weather proofing the socket opening. the instructions were like ""just let it dangle out or whatever""...rice. !<

Your options are like runner in a race trying to set a world record(target price).   In the middle of the race if you are near beating or beating the pace you need to win then the chance you will succeed are good  but if you are just near the necessary pace very close to the finish line then the chance you will succeed are lower.

2021-05-01 11:28:54,wallstreetbets,I do understand IV crush and acknowledge it. The IV was not high initially and barely moved 20% for a full crush. What I‚Äôm saying is ALL options calls and puts ITM and OTM even a month out got horribly crushed even with an $80 jump and record breaking earnings.
2021-04-30 20:24:50,wallstreetbets,I missed the run up last time. Thanks for letting me know. Wouldn't complain if that happens again. I do like the stock and currently selling deep otm calls.

2021-05-01 18:52:00,wallstreetbets,11-35% depending on the source used. Low float in general which is why volume spikes the price every time.

Since both companies are worthless in terms of technicals and fundamentals analysis, and what we do here at WSB is to bet, I am currently more concerned with a slightly longer bet than day to day YOLOs.

On day to day YOLOs,  CLOV might be shit like MVIS, but if it does tank:

What are your thoughts that holding will eventually prevail?

Even if CLOV isn't fundamentally the best company, it has a few things going for it. The stock is still undervalued by a few dollars, there are at least some short sellers that could potentially be squeezed, and the new government leadership is going to be expanding the medical system.

I also just think the huge influx of new users changed the dynamics of the stocks being bought/sold on this sub. A hell of a lot more FOMO and paper hands, I don't think people are nearly as capable of diamond hands like the GME experience."

Still, its a good opportunity for MVIS apes to learn a little bit more about all this shit, I know I have, and it has been a painful lesson (average 19/share).

They‚Äôve positioned themselves for an acquisition yes. Their tech is proprietary and they could sell to whomever without an entire buyout and maybe that‚Äôs the direction they choose. Even if LAZR has deals with some automakers I would argue that just gives value to the lidar market as a whole. I‚Äôd still argue MVIS tech is the best out there right now by a good margin.

2021-04-30 23:09:49,wallstreetbets,"So MSFT potentially can make up to $22B over 10 years on holo lens. Buying MVIS IP would save them from having to find a replacement tech.

Do you think MSFT would really pay more than 10% of that? Most acquisitions have a 5 year horizon, so would they make more than $2B on holo lens, once you factor in their development cost and margins? This is after the initial prototype had sensor issues and MSFT paid $150 M for ODGs IP.

But just to be kind, we will value it at $2B. That still makes MVIS only worth $12 a share.

Hope those bags aren't too heavy."
2021-05-01 02:41:22,wallstreetbets,"So then MVIS is worth about $150M, since that's what MSFT bought ODG for."

Then tell me how much each market is worth in the next 5 years, how much market share you think MVIS would capture in that time frame, and how much revenue they would make in that time frame (e.g. the vehicle sensor is still probably 1 year from market facing revenue).

At that point, you have an idea of the valuation, since a buyer would pay 2-3 times that revenue."
2021-05-01 09:13:16,wallstreetbets,"That actually happens a lot with venture capital. A large majority of the firms just follow what the bigger firms are doing. 

The market was a different story, since TSLA decided to manufacture the cars themselves. It took them awhile to get capacity to a point where they could be profitable. The price was low because there was significant risk they couldn't increase production to a point of profitability for their cash on hand.

MVIS is in a slightly less risky boat since they are outsourcing manufacturing, but then have the added risk of a competitor for the exact same product, with more cash on hand, higher market share, and is farther along the development timeline.

The MVIS crowd pretends that none of these risks exist, and that it's a done thing that they will release a product, and capture all the market. They then value that market higher than anyone else. On the buyout side, they expect a company to buy MVIS at a price higher than anyone is expecting revenue at in the next 5 years. While ignoring the comparable sale of ODG for $150M.

Hence, rainbows and unicorns."

2021-05-01 03:32:11,wallstreetbets,"Lol at this ‚ÄúDD‚Äù. Arguably the worst one I have seen here so far. 

‚ÄúThey plan to sell 1,000,000 cars in one year.‚Äù Which year? The forecast for 2021 is under 100K.

Swap stations are bound to fail, imo. Their goal is to build ‚Äúan innovative collaboration model between the global energy and automotive industries‚Äù. Sure, sounds dandy. However, there are shitload of barriers to be successful. First, they aren‚Äôt going to be swapping batteries in any other cars but their own and, perhaps, some other Chinese manufacturers with inferior technologies (thus, giving away their own competitive advantage). Furthermore, for the time being this grotesque plan works because of the subsidies from the Chinese government. Sinopec, who they signed a deal with, is a state-owned company. They may share charging stations with other manufactures (like Ford), but no one is going to share their own (superior) technology with them in regards to batteries.

They are not coming to Europe beginning next year. The plan is still on hold (and will be for a long time, perhaps forever). Chip shortage is not the only thing that is holding them back. Even if that was the case, and if that is an issue for everyone else, everyone else is already in Europe.

‚ÄúCheapest longest lasting product‚Äù is obviously a stretch and a big one. How do you figure?


They ‚Äúhave solved the milage limit‚Äù, haven‚Äôt they? Not really, from my perspective. I can expand on this as well, but it‚Äôs late.

Tesla made it‚Äôs money dealing in the coin, perhaps, as well as (mainly) the carbon credits. Nio hasn‚Äôt done either, not from car making, battery swapping, nor from sharing of charging stations.

Frankly, this is not a DD. This is confirmation bias for the op himself and the Nio clan. To each their own though.

One more thing. Your valuation implies that Nio is at least as good of a company as Tesla. It ain‚Äôt, obviously.

Good luck with your calls/leaps!"

.. what a sad crap effort that ""inferior Chinese company"" has made compared to glorious Tesla.

And Tesla will leap ahead with the recent opening of their ""GIGA-FACTORY"" (they call it) in Shanghai. I don't know why they chose Shanghai instead of the USA rust belt, nothing to do with market or lower wages I'm sure. TESLA aint APPLE, right?

You will find the strictly fully financial & mathematical and auditor breakdown ""the boardroom & DD"" of  NIO on all the broker's sites and advice sites (AND their expert advice too, make of it what you will).  
SERIOUSLY:  
Make of it what you will - because you trade you must know how much those figures and those expert opinions influence - (one way or the other, not evidently & not always as intended)-  an influence that does not ever really DEFINE share prices, else everyone with a calculator would be rich.

I read them <duh>, I read the technology (the real tech insight is NOT found in the same location) and I try to estimate how the public will deal with, reject or accept that tech, that concept, how long it will take, who else is doing it, do I think it is profitable, will it work, has anyone else noticed..

AND you must estimate what traders and the houses are doing with the shares  
(there may be little DD connection, e.g. we know meme stocks MAY attract more interest and COULD command prices higher or with greater fluctuation than non-meme companies so DD includes meme research as well as profitability per employee, right?).

So like good kidz we have considered the groundedness, the ""solidity"" and the creativity of the company  
(creativity and maturity step on each others feet unless you are big enough to buy in really GOOD startups or small specialists, right?)

And we need to MEDITATE or CHEW UP or shit OUT that stuff in blocks to look at. To  try to figure out the ""why"" of TOMORROWS & NEXT WEEKS share price, and what effect the often STRANGELY ""ineffable"" nature of ""hard-factual"" info will have on the company, the tech, the consumer, the trader, and the daily price of the share = in order toPREDICT.

All makers in that market together sold 1.3 million EV (not hybrid)  in 2020, with sales of 2 million 'projected' for this year, 2021 (Tesla state they ""can"" produce 200,000 in China). however China govt states (intends) to raise percentage of EV across all vehicles sold. & Govt also gives preference to interchangeable batteries.

 At same time chip supply problem, but most rare earths sources are Chinese. Also USA 'antipathy' and possible legislation. BYD main competitor is still largely marketing hybrid and conventional but there are other Chinese competitors following NIO.

I have a sense there is US nationalistic resistance to NIO and 'irrational' pride in local hero Musk. This is PR and perception. 

Sorry I cant justify this figure, it's in my notes unreferenced after wading through a lot of stuff.  My fault.  If you are correct I will still sit on my shares, nevertheless.

2021-05-01 05:52:10,wallstreetbets,"I do think swapping batteries is the future, and you did not think about power grid usage in your example. Can you explain how a swap station would be more expensive than a 15 plug station ? This is not a trick question. I do not know the answer, and am a bit suprised by that. 

I can see no point in a single swap station either, as the main idea is to store, maintain and charge batteries. The place where this is done is the main cost, you may as well have the ability to swap more than one battery at a time. 

A 15 plug charging station, at 250kW per EV charging, consumes around 3.7MW before accounting for losses. That is 0.5% of a nuclear reactor at 100% capacity. You will melt the grid well before it happens.

You should also be able to find the miles long queues for charging stations that were shown last year or so ... charging is only possible with very few EVs. 

Swapping batteries means you can smoothen the load on the grid.  Considering they'd charge at 30 to 50kW, that is 5 to 10 times nicer on the grid. 

I would not be surprised to see both though, like an EV plot with 10 swapping stations and 5 charging."

Still, we agree about the potential of this stock and the sheer (maybe 'slow'\[?\]  but massive) weight of tech, design, long term logic, logistical support, big backing, and developing consumer interest that it has going for it.  
As soon as EVs become common enough to compare in the street or in showrooms, I believe everyone will just look at them and say ""OBVIOUSLY, interchangeable battery is better, wtf, there are so many advantages"".

I have in my head that 'when' NIO reaches **75** it will start being ""one of the big boys"".

2021-05-01 17:14:59,wallstreetbets,"Lol in junior high this well known bully tried to bully me, which I think would be quite a coup since I was a tall and big kid for my age. Anyway he kept dropping his pencil on the floor in class and told me to pick it up. I did the first time but the second I just ignored him, then he stood over me and demanded I pick it up so I bent down and instead of getting it I made a fist and punched upward and hit him right in the mouth and knocked a tooth out. We got sent to the vice principal office and he was pretty pissed at me. But really he had a smirk the whole time. Well as we were in the waiting area his mother comes in and sits down and turns to him and says ""what the he'll did you do this time?"" ""You probably deserved it, I told you someone was going to knock your teeth out some time."" His mother actually advocated for me not to get into trouble lmao. I was in shock.  No one ever had problems with that wimp bully after that."

So you're saying if 3 people ever drive up to assault/kidnap you you're going to, what, ask them not to rather then defend yourself?

I worked at a summer camp and we had a well so when we had to clean the sinks before each group of kids showed up we had to use that stuff. You have to wear a gas mask you have to have gloves and you can't stay the s*** too long. Start to get a little doozy.  It is the most powerful chemical that I've seen distributed to the public.
2021-04-30 22:15:52,wallstreetbets,Sulfuric acid maybe but also maybe lye. But why would they have those there. Best bet is Hydrochloric as it is used for cleaning sometimes. Like toilets.

It was going to be mostly exported to international markets. Gas companies saw an in for finger pointing, though, and it seems to be working. FWIW the national average has gone up $.80 since Nov and I agree it's easy to attribute to the election result, but the Keystone pipeline itself has pretty much nothing to do with it. Prices actually were going up and continued going up when Trump signed approval for it. Gas was the same price it is now before COVID started, and the pandemic is really the only reason it was so low when Trump left office since it didn't fall until shelter in place orders started going out. It's more sensible to attribute the current return to previous prices as a result of confidence that we will soon be returning to business as usual post-pandemic.

2021-05-01 02:19:16,wallstreetbets,"It started with covid which came well before  riots and protests. And when did the dnc take people's guns away? I keep hearing that but I've never seen anyone had their guns taken unless they are a criminal or declared dangerous. Or if they have illegal guns. 

You cant just believe every lie that's told to you and blame half the country for something that hasnt even happened..you are falling right into their trap and are brainwashed into voting against your best interests and the best interests of the country  . you are irrationally scared of losing your guns because you just automatically  believe lies you are told. And you let that determine how you vote over more important things like higher wages, appropriate taxes for rich people, appropriate taxes for corporations, better living conditions, less pollution, cheaper or free healthcare and education. Instead you let your fear of losing your guns determine your votes and you chose people who serve the interests of the richest couple % of americans versus yourself. You should be voting in your best interests to improve your life, not that of rich people. But you just believe irrational lies instead of doing what's best for yourself..it's really sad to me.."
2021-05-01 02:03:33,wallstreetbets,"I don't see how that is relevant to what I said  because ammo shortages came about due to covid. Which arrived 16 months ago and was widespread 13 months ago  . Well before the murder of george floyd and the following protests (mostly) and riots. 

Anyways to answer your ridiculous question that anyone with critical thinking skills can figure out:   it certainly was partially trump's fault... he was in charge of the country and the president's pathetic uncaring reaction to the reason for the protests absolutely made it worse. It doesn't matter if you deluded yourself into not believing this but it's true.

The way the president reacts to things the public feel strongly about has a massive influence on the way things play out. You must be  so incredibly brainwashed that you don't understand this. Or Maybe you are just incapable of understanding it. Idk.  Your moronic response certainly supports the latter."

2021-05-01 01:10:44,wallstreetbets,The death penalty doesn't deter people that commit capital crimes. They just work harder not to get caught. People that don't steal or commit crimes don't not do it because it's a crime. They don't do it because it's not right and because they don't have to.
2021-05-01 03:14:38,wallstreetbets,"Except there's video of Biden saying he's 100% coming for guns.... So I would like to use your own words for the majority of what you believe, and listed, that Democrats in power are actually fighting for. Dont believe every lie that's told to you."
2021-05-01 02:11:56,wallstreetbets,">I don't think it matters who is the president when things like that happen, they can't wave a magic wand like Harry Potter and make things un-happen.

I strongly disagree. the way the president responds to public outcrys over police murdering citizens  makes a big difference in the way things play out. If trump had said what happened was terrible and there is a problem with police in this country and he's gonna do his best to work on it then things would absolutely have gone differently."

2021-04-30 21:40:41,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity has an app upgrade coming soon that will make RH obsolete in terms of even checking prices quickly, I'd highly recommend pulling your hard earned money over to them as quick as possible, it literally takes a day for a partial transfer (if you just pull over some of your positions) so you won't have to worry about missing anything.  Not only will RH most definitely F you over when this pops, but you're also considered ""margin"" on RH so they took alllllll them shares of yours and bet against them with shorts."
2021-04-30 21:11:25,wallstreetbets,Buying more Monday

2021-04-30 22:04:11,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt hate on a brother, dude is doing his part for sure. I mean I agree with not being on RH but also let a man do his own thing, he is on our side."
2021-04-30 20:08:01,wallstreetbets,Vanguard! Plus you can buy super cheap mutual funds with you million dollars in gme trendies. Expense ratios are fractions of percentage. Adults use Vanguard.
2021-05-01 10:05:47,wallstreetbets,how can i also owe them some money?
2021-04-30 22:05:07,wallstreetbets,Seeking knowledge should not be looked down on.
2021-04-30 23:40:38,wallstreetbets,I use Schwab now. I fucking hate it tbh but I‚Äôm never going back to RH. Maybe TD is the way
2021-05-01 04:51:57,wallstreetbets,I am Canadian so I use wealth simple
2021-04-30 22:27:26,wallstreetbets,It's their loss not mine. I switched to fidelity recently
2021-05-01 00:30:25,wallstreetbets,"Last time RH shut down trading so yeah, people being reliant on it is dumb and stupid"
2021-05-01 01:05:45,wallstreetbets,Talk to customer service about it
2021-05-01 10:04:20,wallstreetbets,never covered mine either.
2021-05-01 16:25:42,wallstreetbets,"It took a few weeks for me, which sucked cause I thought it'd only be a few days and I lost a ton of money. Need to make sure you have options purchasing activated first on your new fidelity account or it'll get caught in limbo and youre locked out of both accounts during the transfer window. So maybe just keep the options on one account till you eventually sell them and just transfer the shares"
2021-04-30 23:09:38,wallstreetbets,In some cultures purposely overpaying is seen as a flex
2021-05-01 01:18:54,wallstreetbets,I meant 483 sharesüòÇ

2021-05-01 08:30:21,wallstreetbets,Lol not quite how it works but ok
2021-05-01 10:42:07,wallstreetbets,Thank you. Just a bit nervous. I spent $ I set aside for new oven.

2021-05-01 00:56:00,wallstreetbets,"Where are you seeing 28M in volume? With the exception of Tuesday, where it closed at around 10M, it‚Äôs been around 4M per day."
2021-04-30 22:41:23,wallstreetbets,"Not  hedge funds. Options move the needle, and let's just say the options activity for next week looks very favorable.

The overhead call wall (sold to open) calls are disappearing. 

Sold to open puts are disappearing too. 

Google call walls and put walls, gist of  it is it squashes volatility. 

Thetagang is moving on to other targets which is going unpin  gamestop."
2021-04-30 21:16:29,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, it's full on crazy mode in this sub now.  So many people are holding bags that conspiracy theories are now the majority view.  We've had to endure months of ""the second squeeze is DEFINITELY happening this week"", and it shows no signs of ever ending.  These people are delusional, and it is beyond pathetic."
2021-04-30 21:10:38,wallstreetbets,Exactly.... and you got downvoted for this bit of basic logic! Clearly many are selling.
2021-05-01 16:39:59,wallstreetbets,IB
2021-05-01 04:58:30,wallstreetbets,is the premarket right when it opens or a few minutes before?
2021-04-30 20:45:01,wallstreetbets,Wait a fucking minute...are you saying other companies have stocks too???
2021-04-30 20:31:18,wallstreetbets,"No, no it‚Äôs not"
2021-04-30 22:57:23,wallstreetbets,Elaborate why you think so
2021-04-30 23:08:21,wallstreetbets,Yay
2021-05-01 10:21:22,wallstreetbets,Please dont use a new app to execute risky trades
2021-04-30 22:51:10,wallstreetbets,"right

I think I will sell since it will never go over $185"
2021-04-30 23:34:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and? Keep your cultist fuckwittery to yourself."
2021-04-30 21:12:41,wallstreetbets,I am happy to sell those to you.

2021-04-30 21:03:16,wallstreetbets,"Shit like that keeps happening.

After [a certain currency that shall remain nameless] went up 3700% last week, Robinhood had a major trading outage (again) that made it impossible for investors to join in. Kind of like what happened in January with Gamestop. RH just isn‚Äôt reliable when you need it the most.

P.S. I did not downvote you."
2021-05-01 10:02:11,wallstreetbets,">	 so y‚Äôall would rather downvote me then just give me a simple answer lmao

Because this has been explained many, many, many times on this sub. Simple utilization of the search function will give you an answer."
2021-04-30 23:42:33,wallstreetbets,The fact that he is still on Robinhood actually hurts our side because they will sell his shares right at the beginning of the squeeze without his consent taking fuel out of the rocket. The squeeze isn‚Äôt live and you still have a great chance to transfer to fidelity or vanguard who are both GME friendly. Robinhood will literally rob you.
2021-04-30 23:39:32,wallstreetbets,But correct me if I‚Äôm wrong you signed and gave permission for Robinhood to liquidate your shares if they ever need to cover.
2021-04-30 22:46:44,wallstreetbets,"It's not hate, more jealousy. He can fuck around with 86k and I have to defend my lower xx shares.... definitely jealousy"
2021-04-30 20:02:09,wallstreetbets,"Ok, now I‚Äôm literally in tears over this shit. Still have 43 shares of GME on RH. Read this, hopped over and opened a Vanguard account, but their stupid website keeps messing up on the transfer page. I‚Äôve tried it like 20 times now, same lane ass shit. Now I‚Äôm in tears and stressed the fuck out over this shit. üò¢"
2021-04-30 20:24:25,wallstreetbets,Didn't TD shut down buying of GME during the squeeze in January?  I thought they all pretty much did except for Fidelity.  I'm on TD and have looked into switching to fidelity but the functionality and look of their platform is hard to love
2021-04-30 23:55:38,wallstreetbets,TDA turned off GME buying during the fiasco. I don't trust them. I moved to fidelity who is the least likely to screw me
2021-04-30 20:09:34,wallstreetbets,"Vanguard never stopped any trading. They are like the co-op of investment platforms. There securities platform is a little uninformative, but just track progress in a separate app like yahoo finance (may have just dated myself)."
2021-04-30 20:54:44,wallstreetbets,Just transfered all money OUT of TD Ameritrade. They are most certainly a terrible broker. Was there for a lot of years but the place has jumped the shark no doubt.
2021-04-30 21:55:23,wallstreetbets,Never had a problem at ETrade and I call a guy there with any issues and they are instantly fixed.  Also like the Power ETrade screens that I have customized.
2021-05-01 09:49:01,wallstreetbets,"I use Public. They don't do payment for order flow, and it is an easy app to understand. They do not do options, though."
2021-04-30 20:10:13,wallstreetbets,No fireworks when you make a trade. Bush League!
2021-05-01 09:13:53,wallstreetbets,"They shut down buying, not selling, and so did a dozen others. they're all in the same game."
2021-05-01 01:07:01,wallstreetbets,"Will do, Fidelity CS has been awesome. Thanks for the heads up!"
2021-05-01 13:15:04,wallstreetbets,How is this a good buy? Isn't all this hype over and gme is heavily overvalued with all the hedge's pulled out and a lack of media coverage. Aren't they projected to lose like 30% of their value per quarter untill they hit the mid 50s?
2021-05-01 10:16:36,wallstreetbets,Fidelity has a policy of saving you money (across routes)
2021-04-30 21:12:50,wallstreetbets,"I suppose, to be fair, I would be astonished by that too.  But mostly because the price won't reach 1/5 that."
2021-05-01 08:52:20,wallstreetbets,"I can't post pictures and I don't feel like going to imgur but if you go to Marketwatch you can see the average. Now, this is the 65 day average so there will be some skew with the crazy volume earlier this year."
2021-04-30 23:03:06,wallstreetbets,Have you seen how many times this has happened in the past and failed? Or succeeded?

2021-04-30 23:36:39,wallstreetbets,We need less people like you
2021-04-30 21:49:08,wallstreetbets,Are you going to say that if it moons and you lose your shirt? Self righteous much Jesus
2021-05-01 00:20:20,wallstreetbets,Transfer to Fidelity ASAP man. RH will fuck you hard
2021-05-01 08:24:11,wallstreetbets,But WHY
2021-05-01 07:37:29,wallstreetbets,"Hi I‚Äôm new to Reddit and somewhat new to RH. So, you‚Äôre saying I can open a new account with Fidelity and link it to RH for purchasing stocks? Can it be done online or do I need to reach a rep by phone to do so? Thanks for the tip!"
2021-04-30 23:54:55,wallstreetbets,Not when they feel like it just if they need liquidity which is almost just as bad
2021-05-01 11:14:50,wallstreetbets,Only for Margin
2021-05-01 08:26:19,wallstreetbets,Schwab accepts PFOF from Citadel.
2021-04-30 20:29:30,wallstreetbets,Any knowledge on how webull is?
2021-04-30 23:53:49,wallstreetbets,That is in fact what the fine print says.
2021-04-30 23:30:00,wallstreetbets,"Open a Fidelity account and transfer your shares there. Ape together, strong üí™üèºü¶ç"
2021-05-01 16:53:03,wallstreetbets,"You're transferring to a broker with something called ""customer support,"" give them a call."
2021-04-30 23:13:45,wallstreetbets,"‚òπÔ∏è

Try calling them."
2021-05-01 09:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Ape tears make strongest rainbows. If nothing else, TD Ameritrade is user friendly."
2021-04-30 20:21:33,wallstreetbets,"You're right he has a bigger chance at starting ww3 with China than Trump did bitching about them. I don't know shit about politics im here for dino tendies. In all honesty though TD Ameritrade is great. But I do have a webull account with chump change in it because I got 12 months of lvl2 data for free thats nice to have in a user friendly interface on my phone. I used to trade with chase but it is too slow and sometimes the charts and your position never load at all, a real problem since stock prices can change drastically in seconds.
All that being said webull is still better than robinhood."
2021-05-01 10:13:48,wallstreetbets,"Yes. That is evidence of manipulation. You think they won't manipulate their app again to serve their institutional customers? You are the product, not the customer. It's more likely they will sell your position early than disable the sell button again"
2021-05-01 15:13:40,wallstreetbets,It has at least 120% institutional ownership... so that‚Äôs 84 million shares owned with a 70 million total float. Work that one out.
2021-05-01 14:52:34,wallstreetbets,it's a giant meme it's in no way a good investment
2021-05-01 16:01:58,wallstreetbets,It's a completely retarded buy lol
2021-04-30 21:40:52,wallstreetbets,"Something told me I was going to hear you say that since you‚Äôve done everything in your power to back up Robinhood it only makes sense that you would hate on the GME crowd. $1000 is very feasible if a squeeze did happen. Am I saying a squeeze is certain, no. However, if shorts truly have not covered and a squeeze of a more than 140% short stock happened it could easily get to $1000."
2021-05-01 01:09:07,wallstreetbets,How many times what happened?
2021-05-01 05:29:56,wallstreetbets,Ah thanks fham
2021-05-01 08:34:08,wallstreetbets,Lol you have no clue do you
2021-05-01 13:13:24,wallstreetbets,check my comments dipshit not everyone is a bot that realizes GME is never gonna get to a million a share or some dumb shit
2021-04-30 21:51:24,wallstreetbets,I can sell some to you as well üòä
2021-05-01 00:04:53,wallstreetbets,This is NOT the way lol
2021-04-30 20:01:30,wallstreetbets,Ttue but to be honest I really like the IU of their app
2021-05-01 08:51:42,wallstreetbets,Hopefully enough to get off. Might transfer back just to get an orgasm ü§£
2021-05-01 08:04:11,wallstreetbets,"It's a transfer, not a link. You would be moving all your money/stocks from rh to fidelity. All can be done online"
2021-04-30 21:55:22,wallstreetbets,"They can only do it to margin accounts. Which is the default for everyone using instant deposit, which is basically everyone."
2021-05-01 10:26:18,wallstreetbets,I didn‚Äôt know that.  I do know that I get price improvements on my limit orders FREQUENTLY on both buys and sells. I haven‚Äôt gotten that anywhere else. Maybe it‚Äôs marketing. But it feels good to get a few extra dollars per week (options contracts often improve by 0.01)
2021-05-01 17:25:21,wallstreetbets,Same for Fidelity (commission-free)... Vanguard is the way
2021-04-30 20:36:21,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs an app based brokerage that uses pay for order flow, also has some social media components.  Chances of SCHW, Fidelity, of VanG going tits up is minuscule. Chances of WeBull doing so exists."
2021-05-01 17:26:59,wallstreetbets,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/ their primary broker is Apex, they are not recommended"
2021-05-01 00:54:22,wallstreetbets,I was reading the whole terms of service. They really sneak it up on you and use vague language
2021-05-01 17:30:08,wallstreetbets,"But they are a commission free broker and sell the order flow to Citadel, which doesn't make them the best. The best thing he can do is calling them, they are VERY professional."
2021-05-01 10:50:00,wallstreetbets,"For one, they never disabled the sell button lmao. Theyre just as corrupt as any other brokerage, they just got caught running out of money. everything you mentioned is jailtime, not fines."
2021-04-30 22:58:53,wallstreetbets,Damn bro how you making 1/2k a week? Is that solely off day trading?
2021-04-30 21:48:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah yeah.  It's been the same mantra for the last 4 months, every fucking day in nearly every fucking post.  We get it.  It's *totally* about to happen.

Honestly, I don't care, I only visit here occasionally to mock the people still holding the bags and repeating the same retarded stuff over and over.  This sub has gone to shit, and it is sad, I used to love it."
2021-05-01 08:50:02,wallstreetbets,"How many times does these ""perfect setups"" happen yet no squeeze?"
2021-04-30 21:12:35,wallstreetbets,"five downvotes, this place, what? :)"
2021-04-30 21:52:08,wallstreetbets,I ain‚Äôt buyin that shit. I don‚Äôt touch GME lol all you sucka
2021-05-01 09:45:02,wallstreetbets,Is there another way tbh
2021-05-01 00:18:45,wallstreetbets,"That's fine. Use their app to track shit. But if you're playing GME or any other volatile asset, they're not a good brokerage to have on account of the two trade halts they pulled recently."
2021-04-30 21:48:02,wallstreetbets,"That'd be User Interface, UI, compadre. it is a nice design. i find it rather manipulative but it is easy to consume."
2021-04-30 21:30:15,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve tried. Every broker says my Robinhood account doesn‚Äôt exist because it‚Äôs only 8 digits (been around awhile)
2021-05-01 05:48:43,wallstreetbets,Took 2 weeks but ny transfer finally went through this week. Load off my shoulder. Still have 2 shares un RH but will be out shortly
2021-05-01 08:33:50,wallstreetbets,What app would you recommend transferring to? I‚Äôm on RH and I‚Äôm getting leery of all the complaints.
2021-05-01 09:29:11,wallstreetbets,Brilliant- thank you. I had no idea I could do that. I always linked Fidelity to employer investment plans like 401K
2021-04-30 22:00:24,wallstreetbets,"Right but that's not what he said... RH can't legally touch YOUR shares, no one but you can sell your shares... But if it's under margin then those are not your shares"
2021-04-30 20:53:05,wallstreetbets,Awesome. I appreciate that and it looks like I have to switch yet again..
2021-04-30 21:10:57,wallstreetbets,What are the advantages of using those brokerages compared to Robinhood?
2021-04-30 20:02:44,wallstreetbets,"Vanguard is legit for long-term holing, but they only have after-hours trading until 5:30 ET.  Fidelity or TD should give you complete premarket and after-hours"
2021-05-01 00:19:22,wallstreetbets,"yes, day trading options, I look for volatile ones and stocks I know like Redfin, Netflix, Airbnb, Nio. Even $20-100 profit is good, it adds up fast. Tesla is the best, it is just veeeeery expensive and easy to lose a lot of money on it.But: buying dirt-cheap next-day expiration calls and puts on Thursday end of the day seems a good tactic.  
My day job is on the weekends and evenings so I have some time in the morning working on it."
2021-04-30 21:49:51,wallstreetbets,Honestly not many people r bag holders. I doubled down when it went back to 40 and my cost basis is now 100. That‚Äôs great for a stock that with or without a squeeze is worth tons more. Thanks for your concern though.
2021-05-01 13:12:58,wallstreetbets,"I didn't say squeeze. Just areas of resistance / support. 

If you scalp its good to know where key gamma strikes are, areas of liquidity, if it's call gamma in control or put gamma."
2021-04-30 22:00:15,wallstreetbets,I think you‚Äôre lost
2021-04-30 22:05:50,wallstreetbets,"Good, smart decision!"
2021-05-01 13:39:57,wallstreetbets,"TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, ETrade. 

Anything but Robbinghood lol"
2021-05-01 00:45:58,wallstreetbets,"Agree totally, all my recent purchases are through Fidelity and my watch lists on RH"
2021-04-30 22:01:47,wallstreetbets,"lol yes UI, I must have been thinking about growth hormone when I wrote that

Also, I'm drunk and posting from my phone"
2021-04-30 22:31:15,wallstreetbets,Get a human on the phone like you'll be able to atv any real brokerage
2021-05-01 08:19:43,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs up with that ? Explain ? Where should I move to that‚Äôs a real account then ?
2021-05-01 10:10:46,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity, vanguard, there are others too."
2021-04-30 22:02:13,wallstreetbets,"You don‚Äôt own your shares in RH. Everyone knows this by now. Hell, there are reports of shares transferred out from CASH accounts being marked as MARGIN when the other broker receives it. I have no doubt that there are no such thing as a cash account on RH, therefore nobody owns their shares on RH. Please leave RH for fucks sake."
2021-04-30 21:21:12,wallstreetbets,"Firstly, RH lists options the wrong way. Annoying af.  Also they lied about the GME buying restrictions. I care less about GME. But that messed people up and the REAL reason was because they were under capitalized. They didn‚Äôt admit to that until weeks after. So Fook those putos."
2021-04-30 20:21:04,wallstreetbets,shit i'll keep an eye out for that.  Signed up for fidelity but haven't transferred from TD yet.  Their platform was off-putting to me.  It looked like 1996 quickbooks.
2021-05-01 14:22:46,wallstreetbets,Do you at all mind telling us what $$$ you have/started with to earn that 1-2k? Thx.
2021-05-01 13:15:39,wallstreetbets,I don't do anything with that so I assume you are right. O am terrible with anything short term.
2021-04-30 20:37:28,wallstreetbets,"North of a million. Lmao. Dude was right, you‚Äôre a fucking conspiracy nut if you believe that dumb shit"
2021-04-30 22:00:56,wallstreetbets,Lost? Isn‚Äôt this where the geniuses blowing their life savings is?
2021-05-01 13:42:49,wallstreetbets,Fidelity lol
2021-04-30 22:06:01,wallstreetbets,good times lol cheers
2021-05-01 10:57:20,wallstreetbets,FD
2021-05-01 00:51:11,wallstreetbets,"Happened to me with my move to Fidelity. All marked with an ‚ÄúM‚Äù. Took less than 24 hours, however. I did a partial, all but a fractional share. Initiated on Sunday night, didn‚Äôt touch my RH account all day Monday, was in Fidelity by midnight. Tuesday, showed as margin, called Fidelity, they said to give it one day to settle and call back‚Äîcalled first thing Weds and they switched them to cash in seconds."
2021-05-01 00:12:32,wallstreetbets,If they did it once what are the chances of it happening again if GME were to go that high again? I mean it didn‚Äôt affect me directly. Which brokerage would you recommend for a retarded beginner?
2021-05-01 11:13:55,wallstreetbets,"I put in a stupid market order with things moving quickly on NOK during the peak of the frenzy, and trading halted almost simultaneously by TDA. Price was around 4.79, and they filled me at 9.10, then halted again and momentum was completely dead. Fuck TDA"
2021-04-30 20:29:55,wallstreetbets,thinkorswim by TDA is kinda undefeated though imo
2021-05-01 17:12:38,wallstreetbets,"to make $1,000/week I started with a $5,000 capital. I had to watch it, not to buy/sell an option the same day unless it really worth it, so I had to sell them the next day (under 25k I was allowed to make 4 day tades/week) Sell/buy was ok though.  
I make 12-28 day trades a day."
2021-05-01 13:22:18,wallstreetbets,"It's not negative or positive just means we might see more movement in gme next week could go either way, there is a major put wall at 150 so that's likely to be a support area, and there is a call wall at 200 which is likely to be resistance if they are sold to open options. If bought to open they will increase upward and downward movement."
2021-04-30 21:58:57,wallstreetbets,Read the DD. The float is shorted many times over.
2021-04-30 22:02:50,wallstreetbets,They prefer ‚Äúretard‚Äù though. Some people get offended by the word genius

I'm probably planning on selling with news, and possibly buying back in but more discriminating, since I don't think it's a for-sure thing at all that retail weed will be profitable under such heavy taxation."
2021-05-01 12:37:47,wallstreetbets,"I think you are way off on the quality assessment. Respect to bc (can see it from my deck right now), but, because of market size, bc will not be able to keep up. If you think the left coast is going to make it possible for any foreign company to take a large market share from a bread and butter crop, you are delusional. Quality is really not a concern in this market since the whole spectrum is available at most every dispensary. This was a meme play from the start and that's not going to change."

2021-04-30 21:13:35,wallstreetbets,"A lot went wrong with Canada‚Äôs entry into legal cannabis. E.g., serious limits on how many stores could initially open. I think it‚Äôll balance out post-pandemic and you‚Äôll see most of the market move to the legal stores."
2021-05-01 12:55:03,wallstreetbets,"Prices have normalized. With the ability to know exactly what you're getting and not dealing with private market difficulties all the young people i know just go to the dispensary. As you would expect, there are not black market level profits, but the owners of dispensaries that I know are doing pretty well. Usually, you'd see at least some and often many start up businesses fail and close shop, but in my area every single one is still running, have even expanded hours, and are making capital investments to improve their facilities. That indicates they are doing well in general. That's just a guess without seeing the books, though."
2021-05-01 13:52:32,wallstreetbets,"I see what you are saying, and I think supporting little regional companies is a good thing. If there is good weed in Delaware or wherever then by all means support it! As for quality and expertise, you might underestimate BC and Canada in general. There is some serious expertise that i suspect will be exported to other facilities around the world. Tilray is a company that medicinal user friends have been praising long before full legalization and are a great fit with Aphria's recreational reach. I think the new connection to the EU and especially Germany speaks to the level of quality and consistency that they will be able to pull off on a large scale. Meme stock though, hunh?"
2021-05-01 16:48:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but I hope they make you lots of money."
2021-05-01 07:59:57,wallstreetbets,Issue is that the only way to lock in the spread was to short TLRY - otherwise I got run over haha

2021-04-30 21:28:02,wallstreetbets,"This is why you need to do your own Due Diligance, and not just believe whatever you read on a Reddit Sub. 
You also have to consider the fact that stocks have been being manipulated for short term gains for many years, buy the stock low, get some press releases made, jack up the price, then sell before it drops again. Subs like WSB have just made it easier for that to happen. Get some bots with a bunch of different accounts to post the same basic info, and say how great they‚Äôre doing with the stock, how more stocks have been shorted than are available, or how much ‚ÄúI like the stock,‚Äù then sell as high as you think you can get away with before it drops back down to its actual value.
Just an idiot that pays attention, this is not financial advice. Do whatever the heck you want with your money."

My only saving grace is I was (am) a gambling addict so I look at it like , well it's no more then I would have put on a craps table or in a slot machine soo .... Eh.   Why it is important to not invest more then you can afford to lose.  Also the thing is once you lose a craps roll or the reels stop spinning you have no chance to get your money back at all. At least with stocks if it goes down or crashes then you still own the shares.  If you just hold them you never know. 6 months down the road it could jump back up."

2021-05-01 09:27:00,wallstreetbets,"GME was my introduction into stocks. Admittedly, I‚Äôm a retard. My entry point was during the second day of its ascent in February, bought 10 at 230, and 500 amc at 16. Yes. You read that correctly. (Actually that was because Ameritrade didn‚Äôt automatically have it in ‚Äúmarket price‚Äù so it way overcharged me when amc was at actually at 13.)

Anyway... I lost about 5000 in one day on my first ever stock purchase. I felt sick... but... was such an important lesson in Entry and exit position and how to divest myself of my emotional reactions... 

The market is just human emotional reactions played against computer algorithms day trading LOL 

Anyway, I averaged down with 20 more shares when GME went to 40, and then, please don‚Äôt hate me diamond boys, I sold everything, for a profit, at 230 again.

I was happy to make a few thousand and call it at that. 

My point I guess was that all
Of this IS an expensive lesson and crash course in many different trading techniques and skills I was and still am completely oblivious to. 

Buying and holding ended up seeming pretty stupid (for me) without an extensive understanding of calls and shorts...  as I am interested in making money not loosing it.

If i held id be down .11 on my 200 but instead was up .03 on my 700

This is a casino, double down on an 11 everytime, sometimes you get a monkey or other times you get a 2, in this case i got lucky but it doesn't always work this way, better to not double down like me unless you got big balls and give zero fucks.

2021-05-01 05:34:38,wallstreetbets,"Thank for linking that. I can firmly say I would not have gone in heavily on that because I like to look a company's stock price history as a whole over the course of at LEAST a year and figure out a more or less baseline of what that stock would normally be on an average day. If that stock is normally 25'ish then I'm not doing call contracts betting that it's going over $30 and certainly not $70 calls like OP. I might hold some shares in a case like this, but calls? No. Those kinds of moves might make someone rich overnight if they pan out, but realistically it's a long shot gamble and I say low gain consistency > high gain long shots.

For me to buy high yield calls, every single star has look like it's aligning for that company. It has to look like a win from every direction, and those kinds of stocks don't come along often (although it does happen)."

There are some indicators that can help. When a stock that has just run, is relaxing maybe, converting into sideways movement, a cross of VWAP, a volume surge, an increasing RSI over 50, a couple green candles in a row, a MACD negative to positive crossover. Then BOOM. One of these days I am going to be on one of these and transform my small account and hopefully make back my small but accumulating losses....

For Someone with little money to start with- Potential earnings (statistically) come from the lower dollar. Chances of a 3000 dollar stonk going 300 percent are slim due to market caps and other factors. If you‚Äôre looking for safe and small changes over time- go for the highest dollar. If you‚Äôre going to make a substantial profit- statistics say go with the lower dollar.

There are definitely elements to it that are not what they seem (which makes it a ""scam""), but we also saw a big jump in the price of silver during the Feb. squeeze and that was mostly SLV purchases. If there are enough options bought on SLV, and there's  big jump in silver price, I think gamma-driver purchases of SLV will in turn affect the spot price of silver.

Which is all to say, I think these options we hold are good buys :) Good luck to both of us!"

2021-05-01 06:23:57,wallstreetbets,See if you came to me with silver in a collapse situation I'd say no. I'd have no way of converting its value. Not in the beginning anyway. Maybe I'm overthinking it. But if I have food and you offered me silver what would I do with it?

If the price of silver has been kept artificially low, then it hasn‚Äôt been economical to open new silver mines. Silver mines take about 10 years to open (from exploration to operation), 70% of silver mined is a byproduct. They are shooting themself in the foot. Once the price rises, it should rise fast, few new mines mean if a demand increases, supply will not be able to keep up.

With or without me, eventually the market will find find a way. Things will happen quicker, the more people that are on board. Of course things will take forever if people give up before they even try.

Not everyone has to go all in on silver, or has to have some grand idea fiat is going to be replaced by silver."
2021-05-01 08:42:29,wallstreetbets,"Meh. I don‚Äôt see silver going to zero. I am not investing money I don‚Äôt have, I am no going to go insolvent."

2021-05-01 13:28:33,wallstreetbets,Concur that SLV seems to buy some silver when unit purchases are high. Seems like an unofficial reserve ratio.

2021-05-01 13:08:26,wallstreetbets,"Not if it's within the same year. If you made a million in February from GME calls then lost it all on TSLA calls and SPY puts in the same year, your net is 0 during the tax year. The cap on losses is only when the *total* net capital gain is negative for the tax year, and it's capped at -$3000.

I'm not a tax planner but this is pretty easy stuff to see from the form 8949 and schedule D."
2021-05-01 09:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, and Thank you, I was unaware of this.

2021-05-01 12:31:17,wallstreetbets,SLV is the only way to play options on the actual price of silver (and the only options with even an outside change of increasing actual demand _for_ silver). Others have pointed out that options on miners like AG or SILJ (miner etf) will increase proportional to silver price and might even go up by a larger %.
2021-05-01 00:55:36,wallstreetbets,"I just threw some cash at $SILJ and $SIL options. Both are ETFs on miners, and they generally move with the price of silver, and $SILJ tracks junior miners which are more volitile, so provides another level of ""leverage"" to the price of silver."

2021-05-01 12:19:47,wallstreetbets,how big a company we talking here? If like 400+ just get like Workday tbh
2021-05-01 12:36:22,wallstreetbets,"Workday is more HRIS and less financials. Workday Adaptive doesn't compete as well with SAP or Oracle (Fusion or Netsuite) in financials or accounting.

Depends on revenue, GL structure, etc etc but typically most companies outgrow QuickBooks for Netsuite even with oracle's reputation"
2021-05-01 13:18:35,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree. You'd usually see companies outgrow quickbooks for netsuite as a first step. But if they are especially high growth or in certain industries, they might look at Workday Financials. 

All these vendors have pros and cons with Core Financials and Planning depending on industry. Obviously, Energy and manufacturing tend to gear towards SAP and sometimes Oracle. Workday Financials absolutely crushes though it in certain industries with like Fintech, Software, Business Services + Insurance. 

As with most business software, successful and thoughtful implementation is the key though. Plenty of companies buy software, hire a god-awful partner for implementation, and then think the software is the problem."
2021-05-01 18:41:01,wallstreetbets,"Well said all around. Loved when a CFO told me that ERP stands for ""early retirement plan"" because it's a quick way to lose your job if an implementation fails. 

Love talking SaaS but don't get many opportunities to on WSB.

2021-05-01 01:22:06,wallstreetbets,"Not OP, but QNX/IVY is poised to dominate the automotive OS sector in the next couple of years. The beauty of QNX is that it is the most secure automotive platform out there. The beauty of IVY is that is solves the data collection problem. Today, the only way the majority of car makers can access vehicle data is to physically plug into it. With IVY, that not longer becomes necessary, allowing manufacturers to gather metrics on every single vehicle on the road. This is useful in many ways. At the basic level, they can gather information that will help them improve their cars. If we dig even deeper, that data will allow them to further develop their own autonomous systems (which QNX is also doing).

&#x200B;

Tesla is ""successful"" with their auto pilot partially due to the piles of data they have about their cars. Other carmakers will be able to also have that advantage now.

&#x200B;

There are other technical aspects to QNX/IVY that will also make it an attractive option for carmakers. IVY for instance is totally agnostic, and it can run on any platform. Don't want to use AWS? Cool, you don't have to. Furthermore, BB will not own nor block the data collected on the vehicles. Each manufacturer will have complete access to all metrics collected. Typically, the advantage of rolling your own systems is complete control and ownership over your data. The way IVY is designed eliminates the fears that a carmaker may have.

&#x200B;

The other thing I am bullish about is BB's partnerships with Chinese carmakers. They have the biggest car market in the world, with tons of ""successful"" EV startups. Those are all potential customers with less competition, given that other offerings are not allowed in China. Additionally, a partnership with Baidu was announced (Chinese Google basically), although the details of that are still not widely available, so it can be meaningless.

&#x200B;

As with every DD (if you can even call this DD), here is the bear thesis:

&#x200B;

* This can truly be a major disruptive technology, but as with any disruptive technology out there, it carries tons of risk. All of this is still in development and has not been released yet. Technical risks and missing expectations is a big hurdle here.
* The other knock against their future plans is the desire for carmakers to pull a Tesla and roll their own software. As I mentioned above, they will have less reason to do so with the way IVY is designed for instance, but there is more to a car OS than just data. I can see larger manufacturers attempting to build their own OS. VW is already trying that out, and I expect some other large ones like Toyota to try the same thing. Time will tell if they will actually succeed.
* Competitors: the only real competitor out there right now is AGL (Linux), which is open source and offers carmakers and third parties all the bones to build software on top. There are a few players out there that are using AGL to build their own distros, and carmakers like Toyota are on board the AGL train. QNX is still the leader, but they are definitely not alone.
* Infotainment: This is by far the biggest weakness of QNX. Plainly, their infotainment offering is shit, which is what is causing a lot of customers to drop that aspect of their product. Ford, for instance, dropped QNX Infotainment in favour of Android. They are still using QNX, just not for the infotainment side.

&#x200B;

Note: I haven't even spoken about their current bread and butter business (security) which is being used in many government and military organizations. They also have Cylance which they keep talking about, but I am not familiar with that side of the business enough to have an opinion. With respect to QNX/IVY though, if they execute properly, they have a very bright future ahead of them."
2021-05-01 08:13:56,wallstreetbets,"MVIS I got into a month ago, sold back on Monday, bought back in later in the week, now a bag holder at $20.....but I bought back in to hold long term. Knew it would dip at earnings as expected (wanted to hold shares in case of any surprises even though the A-sample announcement hit Wednesday), was sad it didn‚Äôt drop back to $10 yesterday for a period of time lol. IV is still good so I sold some contracts with a strike of $21 and $22 for May. Worse scenario is my shares sell and I make a little profit but buy back in, best case....my shares don‚Äôt sell, I keep my premium of course, and then do more for a month out. May be able to do that for another month or 2 after, but there is the risk of a buyout in which case you‚Äôd really fuck yourself doing covered calls I think lol."

Yes

No. The infotainment aspect is just one side of QNX. QNX offers much more than that. In fact, their infotainment side is probably the shittiest performing product of QNX."

Their revenue & profit margins are impressive & the mortgage/housing industry is booming. If RKT is at $20+/share I don't see why this can't go that direction as well. I think the stock is waaaay undervalued. Definitely a solid play for the long term, beyond the shadow of a doubt. You buy UWMC & hold, you'll print. This company seriously has its shit together. They're investing in tech to make the process easy, they don't lend to people with low credit, & their rates average less than industry average. People piled into MVIS, which is so overvalued it makes my head hurt, but this gets ignored? That's some messed up logic right there.

I'm very bullish on it & the risk is worth it. I just bought 10 $9 calls for 5/21 & I'm also mulling how many shares I'll be buying prior to Monday open. This stock is a serious winner."

2021-05-01 08:24:02,wallstreetbets,"A derivative has it's value ""derived"" from the value of the underlying asset.

A leaps is a contract that gives you the option to buy but not the obligation to buy an underlying asset at the strike price provided it reaches that strike price by a specified date, ie. Expiry.

The value of the leaps increase as the stock price reaches the strike price of the leaps. Once the strike price is reached it is called, ""in the money"" or ITM.

You can exercise the contract and buy the shares at the strike price even if the share price goes way above the strike price. If you wait and the price goes below the strike price then you can no longer exercise.

If the share price reaches the strike price  then you can also sell the contract to someone else for it's current value. This is what most people do.

Of course, if the expiration date comes then the contract expires worthless and you will lose only the cost of the contract and commission."

# of contracts purchased will vary on your capital available and level of risk tolerance. (I was usually buying 5k worth of calls / puts depending on where things were on swing... Gains used to buy more shares during dips)

RKT is also a great ""wheel"" strategy stock. Sell Covered Calls just above upward resistance (buy back on dips), do secured puts just below downward resistance line.

You wills have to purchase all 200 to make certain you achieved their results.  Otherwise you might mix the next Amazon or Netflix.  Also, they might recommend a stock 2 or 3 times and expect you to keep buying them.  I also wonder why they refuse to publish year by year returns or 1,3,5 and 10 returns like everyone else.  I know they have the information because I heard Dave say so ."
2021-05-01 09:51:37,wallstreetbets,Fuck Motley Fool
2021-05-01 10:36:35,wallstreetbets,Motley fool and yahoo finance are boomer trash.
2021-05-01 10:44:52,wallstreetbets,"Motley Fool is a Boomer Bible for financial advice.  There are plenty of instances where Motely Fool has said to flee a stock and cut losses, only for the stock to recover.  The net result is eating losses rather than acknowledging over time stock prices in fundamentally good companies recover.

I mean holy shit look at Ford.  Ford was lower than 5 bucks.  It wasn't going anywhere, but it had issues.  How many people fled that stock eating losses?  

Here is a 2009 article:  [https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2009/01/28/worst-stock-for-2009-ford.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2009/01/28/worst-stock-for-2009-ford.aspx)

2009's low was 1.58.  What is Ford now?  Yeah.

So what if you went against Motely Fool, bought into Ford with that coveted 1000 bucks they talk about and held?  Well lets say that 1.58 a share netted you 630 shares.  You hang out, oh hell let's just say the next year 2010.  That year it opened at 10 bucks a share.  So now that 630 shares nets you 6300 bucks.

Now think about where Motely Fool kicks in with it's advice.  Yeah you probably make some money but net less because they like to jump on the Merry Go Round mid song.

Motley Fool is good for driving Boomers and the clueless into buying and selling.  If anything I can argue that their performance is based on having a large enough audience where they can drive buying and selling sentiments.  The advantage for retards like us is that when Motley Fool decides the weathervane blows in our favor we see their fan base dump money into an investment we staked out long ago.

At best Motley Fool creates discounts and premiums to be taken advantage of.  At worst it can fuck people out of their money by selling at a loss or encouraging FOMO."

2021-04-30 22:14:00,wallstreetbets,"in the short term, yes. but you couldn't benefit from that. The moment David releases the pick, the price immediately jumps before you could even get it at the previous price. and it doesn't usually continue to rise. Since I've joined, it's usually better to wait a few hours if you want to time the market and wait for the price to settle. The only person who could benefit from that is the fools who know ahead of time. But I check the prices on the analysis page and they use the market close price, not the market open price. so when they calculate the gains, it takes that into consideration.

If you re-did the analysis during a bear market the conclusions could easily be the opposite and since OP isn't sharing the data we don't have a way of comparing.

Basically, you could just buy call options for SPY (or any other index fund based ETF) and see extremely good returns, way more than the index itself, if you happen to do the analysis at the all time high.

High average returns but a LOT of risk."

but u/flybonzai if you're a noob and don't really know what you're doing (like me), invest the same amount in each pick. because some picks will do bad, other picks wil excel. With RB, some picks will do incredibly awful, but it's hard to know which ones will excel. so if you miss the winners, you could end up doing worse than the market.

2021-05-01 06:12:59,wallstreetbets,"The interesting thing is timing... the company moved their earnings up to may 17th from June which is when they did earnings in 2020, a move up in time typically means it will be good, there are correlation articles on this... they moved it to 5 days before options expire (coincidence?)... the CEO has millions of shares locked up until the price gets above 30 and stays above there for 90 days, there are a huge number of call options bought for may, 200k-300k already... will be higher as it gets closer... if the price gets above the strike price close to expiration, shares must be owned for exercising these options by market makers... that‚Äôs like 20-30 million shares as of now, probably 30-50 mill by then, shorts haven‚Äôt covered, still many shares shorted... more data should be coming out about short interests soon... but if there is a huge run up at earnings, could this be the perfect storm for 30-50 million shares needed for options exercising along with 30-40 million shares short covering, plus new apes hitting buy, and possibly a financial institution hopping in... we could see a lot of buying coming in and hitting hard all at once that week... This is definitely something to keep an eye on... üëÄ üöÄüíéüôå"

2021-05-01 06:43:54,wallstreetbets,Will post another TA post based on Friday's price action (4/30/21) by this weekend. Keep a lookout for it!
2021-04-30 20:41:37,wallstreetbets,"12.50 calls + 500 @ 10.04. Selling the calls on the way up in parts. Keeping the stocks untill we reach at least 12 and even then depends on the movement.
Let's hope that the market next week is bullish about growth and healthcare."

2021-05-01 10:56:08,wallstreetbets,"How long have they been working with Microsoft? Six months ago this stock was $1-2 if they didn't see the value in a buyout at $1.50 why would they buy it at 10x that?

Best in Class is a marketing gimmick used by Mvis . They say iit but who agrees? No one else seems to think its ""best in class"" 

What class are they best in?

After 30 years of being a company they made 500k in revenue this year, that Microsoft contract doesn't seem to be all that lucrative."
2021-04-30 21:07:21,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the explanation!
2021-04-30 21:07:07,wallstreetbets,Just gotta inverse the inverse at that point. *taps forehead

2021-05-01 13:37:48,wallstreetbets,"Your logic is backwards.

They have a highly desirable product _now_. That's why a buyout is more likely _coupled_ with the fact that their stock is lower.

> What class are they best in?

The fact you don't know what they make is retarded

And the argument that a company being around for a long time means they won't be any more successful in the future is a false one."
2021-05-01 03:58:53,wallstreetbets,No problem :)
2021-05-01 15:24:37,wallstreetbets,Jep that was the bloody joke.
2021-04-30 22:22:21,wallstreetbets,Probably Sundial is an absolute turd of a company.  Get out before hedge fund weed king CEO of theirs decides they need another 300 million and dilutes again
2021-05-01 07:01:31,wallstreetbets,Honestly why? You could get for the same valuation AMD with better growth prospects.

2021-05-01 13:24:40,wallstreetbets," Belgium has higher income than Italy which GDP per capita is 46k per year against Italy 33k, then it's obvious things or services in Belgium are more expensive than italians."
2021-05-01 13:55:30,wallstreetbets,"I think most Americans assume that a Motorola is going to be an American phone, and also because it has software made by Google. Nope.

2021-05-01 14:57:38,wallstreetbets,"My Italian SIM is from Wind3, 9.99‚Ç¨ per 20 GB. I could even find a better tariff.

Then it would be fair to say that in Belgium it should be ~ 40% more expensive, according to your GDP difference. So in Belgium I should pay about 14‚Ç¨ for 20 GB.

The [thieves at Telenet](https://www2.telenet.be/nl/producten/mobiel/abonnementen/), my current internet provider, ask for 20‚Ç¨ per month. For 20 GB? No. 10 GB? No. 5 GB?! NO! THREE FUCKING GBs! THREE FOR 20‚Ç¨! In 2021! 

How much should I pay according to telenet to have 20GB of mobile internet traffic? 200‚Ç¨? 

Come on, I understand things are more expensive, but not by this much. It's a cartel in Belgium, and I am happy to live in infamy with my Italian sim."
2021-05-01 16:51:40,wallstreetbets,Huawei was a threat to Apple so the government had to play some defense

2021-04-30 22:43:39,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, if you bought at $480, and doubled down at $48. You'd be at a cost basis of $87.28 right now.

Trading something like GME, you need some good rules, like setting a target dip level. Mine is 50% atm, anytime it drops below 50% of my cost basis I'll be doubling down. Over time, as volatility drops, I'll be lowering my dip point."

So, what‚Äôs to stop them, if the SEC committee board is like 10-20 folks...what‚Äôs to stop them from bribing just 11 of them (or whatever the majority number is) with like, $10M, 20M, 50M a piece (aside from the illegality, of course) and set whatever arbitrary sales price they want?

As we‚Äôve all read countless times, these folks committing white collar crimes get a few years in jail and then they‚Äôre done, so wouldn‚Äôt it be pretty tempting for those 11 folks to risk it? Esp if paid with cash?"
2021-04-30 22:49:18,wallstreetbets,Fuck man I‚Äôm dumb.  I‚Äôve been holding NCLH thinking the shares had lots of ground to make up still.

2021-04-30 20:03:34,wallstreetbets,"Well, it clearly does matter if you're talking about whether they've hit pre-COVID highs. You're not comparing apples to apples. That doesn't mean you can't make a bull case, but you're trying to justify a higher market cap for a company that hasn't had significant revenue in over a year.

I played cruises earlier in the year, and there may still be some blood left in that stone because of the general irrationality in the market, but suggesting they haven't hit their past share price isn't a great argument."

2021-05-01 08:19:27,wallstreetbets,"Nok has similar revenue, cash flow and scope to Eric but it's almost half the market cap. They have a duopoly on western 5/6g implementation. This will outperform most things over the next year."

2021-04-30 21:43:07,wallstreetbets,"I am asking as I don't know, what is the value of these licensing fees? Did Nokia disclose them in their 10K? It seems to be in the $20m range if I'm reading their filings correctly - which does not seem significant."
2021-04-30 21:41:00,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I was away for a bit.

You do realize that carriers have disproportionate leverage relative to 5G equipment providers? If AT&T wants to expand their network at a price cheaper than Nokia, someone else will be around to pick up that work. Pricing pressure in this direction is negative. Nokia cannot demand higher prices for its services, but the carriers can demand lower prices. Why do you think Nokia refused to disclose the value of the 5 year deal with AT&T? I imagine because it might not be terribly lucrative and management decided disclosing terms would hurt the share price as it might not meet some investors' expectations. This is speculation. 

I could've worded it better but there is stiff pricing competition between 5G equipment makers and network providers. A gentleman mentioned licensing fees owed by Samsung/Lenovo to Nokia - I could not find a disclosed financial value for that agreement either.

Really, the only positive I can see is the revenue Nokia will make from licensing fees on every 5G smartphone sold but in western markets where Apple is dominant and known for its stiff pricing pressure (just look at Foxconn's margins) it's hard to be bullish on their generated revenues. In China, they will certainly be passed over for Huawei and elsewhere they have to split their crumbs between a number of players (Ericsson, Qualcomm)."

2021-04-30 21:23:59,wallstreetbets,"Nah. I can take it. Not really, but I'll have to. Not selling.

Long game wasn't the plan here but I'm not about to burn 2000 bucks.

Lessons were learned."
2021-05-01 09:06:40,wallstreetbets,"I took a hit buying shares as the price went up but it was really just to support my call option selling strategy. My average was 11.15 initially and i averaged up to 16.60.  So long as there is going to be volatility and volume, i'll be in it.  There was just too much put volume on the other side.  In the game of gambling, the side with the most money wins.

Ps.  If it makes you feel better, i bought 500 at 24.  You didn't take the biggest hit."

Reminded me of silicon valley's Peter Gregory's investment in sesame seeds and Facebook's Eduardo saverin's investment in crude oil futures (though I read on Wikipedia this one was due to insider knowledge rather than ""predicting the weather""). I always wonder if plays like that ever pan out well, seeing as how they always seem so brilliant on paper."
2021-05-01 05:18:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah - it‚Äôs not the most amazing reference. The essence was supposed to be that the SA economy has not performed well and that using Naspers performance as a proxy for that is flawed - Naspers success was effectively betting on the Chinese economy. Using Steinhoff as a proxy is equally flawed but I do think that Steinhoff is more representative of a company that bet on SA performance and could have been a homegrown success story - ie. Our tencent.
2021-04-30 20:28:07,wallstreetbets,"I looked at 7.5 strike again and I think it still might be a buy for may 21. Price was about 8.10$ a share and 7.5 strikes were 1$.

That means that at 8.50 your ITM and at break even level. 

If share price goes to 9 you should make 50$.  Although I didn't add in commission so that number will be lower."

GNW remains a compelling value in the $4s and a number of triggers in 2021 could lead the stock higher (as noted above).

2021-05-01 07:48:16,wallstreetbets,"Born, raised, & educated USA, sir. For the record, I understand retail pretty pretty pretty well friend.

If you think states can fully control what products are successful and what products fail, once the federal government has gotten out of the way and allowed the states to negotiate......like with Canada, then you must not understand capitalism nor supply and demand.

It would be insane to think each state is going to have its own individual winners, and no consolidation is going to happen like is already happening in the market and will continue to happen. States don't pick successful companies bud, thankfully, the US isn't communist or a dictatorship. So consumers and shrewd business men make successful companies what they are in whatever the playing field is, which is decided by governments. Pick your MSO, any company not in a state could simply buy or merge with another MSO or LP eventually, at any given time in the future. States can't control who owns, buys, and mergers with whom......free market.....more capitalism. Don't worry, Tilray will only be the largest Cannabis company for like a year tops, before the next big merger of some other two big players in the market.

You must have not read any of my other posts. State laws, when it comes to controlled substances, like alcohol for example don't usually fully control all the rules. States aren't dictatorships, they have limitations too.

For example, in some states alcohol sales are allowed and in some counties, but not in other. Sometimes, they have different hours you can purchase alcohol in one county vs another and they mere footsteps apart.

""Just because the fed legalized, it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs legal in every state."" --- Obviously bud, but likely all states will legalized it by the time the fed does. I also wouldn't pull the trigger just yet, and say the Fed is going to legalize and just step out of the way and pass on taxation to the states. They will definitely be legalizing one day, AND taking a piece of the pie via some excise tax.

""Look up what dry counties are. The sale Bud light is illegal in those in the US."" --- Dude, you just proved my point and whole thesis man. When the fed gets out of the way, the states will do whatever is in their best interest, however certain things will be out of their control. For the most part, states don't care who wins, they also just want to tax it.

My point is still exactly the same. You keep looking at this through the same lense, and your mind is incapable of thinking outside of the current model or beyond what you already believe to be facts. Your mind seems like a great place to play tabletop shuffleboard, or maybe pool.

Are you sure I don't understand this market man, I mean you can't seem to grasp the idea that consolidation is going to continue to happen in the Cannabis sector, and your grasp on capitalism is scary at best. It's already happening right before your eyes. 

Anyways, I'm done with it. Hopefully this helps you think beyond just the states and you eventually see why that model won't last forever, and that long term brands always win. Nice effort though sir, cheers!üé©üçª"

(Yes that is by law in Illinois) But hey you just keep making things up for a company that doesn‚Äôt even have the money to spend and doesn‚Äôt even turn a profit lol. The ceo makes 18 mil and his company is still hemorrhaging money with those dumb as shit moves(sweet water/Tilray merger) to put on a smoke show that they are entering the us market when it‚Äôs in no way the cannabis market.

Thanks a lot btw, this is a very interesting expansion of my knowledge as far as what options are capable of, managing risk vs. profit potential etc. I'm looking more into it; I understand the concept except for the part where I'm not sure how I would avoid potentially blowing up my account -$40k on selling a ballsy OTM call that actually hits strike? Just want to make goddamn sure I'm grasping this correctly.

(Edit: I am moron. The issue is that I've never sold calls or seen any options actually get exercised. What is the process/chain of events there? I wouldn't have the cash to be able to exercise my ITM to get them the shares, until the buyer pays me the OTM strike for them... does this happen first, and then I have time/a choice of how to deliver the shares or what?)"
2021-05-01 00:25:38,wallstreetbets,Just sell the spread before expiration and avoid all of that.  You never ever want to hold options after they expire.  Markets are efficient and it will be worth almost full profit by that time.  You also have almost a zero percent chance of getting assigned before expiry unless your short call is deep itm near an ex div date.  But if that's the case then you are firmly in the green so you can just take off the spread.

I sold last week at $6.35.

I'm buying back in again once it feels like it's consolidated."

I like their model and have a long runway for growth, little guys aren‚Äôt going away in the next 10 years and who knows what the landscape will be. I‚Äôll pick some up Monday."

2021-05-01 19:51:05,wallstreetbets,But guys this chart isn‚Äôt 1/1. Am I missing something? Because when I look for myself the line I draw from the first red circle to the second extends quite further down in may than the one on this chart.

2021-05-01 03:09:01,wallstreetbets,Lol it‚Äôs hard to time the market. Easier to just buy in and hold sometimes. It‚Äôs still early in the game though.
2021-05-01 03:22:30,wallstreetbets,"I think the way it goes with these innovations, is that it‚Äôs an almost winner-takes-all model. And it looks like UiPath is the front runner."
2021-05-01 17:08:48,wallstreetbets,So it's okay because the other computers on the market are high frequency trading too.
2021-05-01 08:03:36,wallstreetbets,"Having ads on another platform saying ""putting ads on us is good"" is like admitting your ads are not good."
2021-05-01 07:55:26,wallstreetbets,"Hard to say, since we are bombed with so many ads that stuff like that is bound to happen by coincidence. Anyways, I suggest you put an adblocker, a tracker blocker and delete your instagram, at least from your phone."
2021-05-01 08:01:55,wallstreetbets,"Actually, I think this personalized ads thing is mostly a giant scam.

A) Everyone is bombed with a ridiculous amount of ads, so eventually some of them will be noteworthy.

B) Facebook (and other companies) has trackers on many sites, like any site that you can log in to it through Facebook, every site which allows you to share something to Facebook, etc. So if you go to a site of company X, they'll know you've been to that site and serve you ads for that site. Then, if you buy something from that company, Facebook could claim credit for it, even though you heard about it before the Facebook ad."

You are in fact a full blown clown. Hopefully you learned your lesson and your broke ass can still work at Wendy's.

Remember to tread lightly next time. And do real due diligence and not gain conformation bias on something from redditors. 

Especially when you have zero understanding of options pricing or what goes into it."

2021-05-01 13:41:29,wallstreetbets,"I got my answer yesterday and, as expected, the price tanked with earnings.   


I was selling during the last two days of the price dropping to cut losses and take profit while I had it. Waited for the earnings call to take a dump on the price, and bought back in for more shares at a lower average.  


Still long on MVIS, and took out a few calls on it as well."

2021-05-01 12:45:26,wallstreetbets,"Hey you could be right on the $8. However, comparing this to NKLA and ENRON is just plain silly which makes your argument less credible. I appreciate you taking the time to write your thoughts. I just so happen to think the opposite. Guess we will see!"
